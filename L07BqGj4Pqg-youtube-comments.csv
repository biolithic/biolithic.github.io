the morality system was part of why kotor was so great. i loved seeing my character change as i went more sith. would have been great to see that in hogwarts too.
i want to see a morality system in a game that s a little more nuanced than choosing between helping an old lady cross the street and pushing her into a furnace.
melonie irl - nice lady  real sweetheartmelonie in game - it s fun to do bad things
i would have loved to have a morality system in hogwarts  especially if it gave you different endings  a good ending  an evil ending  and a neutral ending.
fallout let s us be good or evil and there s perks for both. it s one of the reasons why i love the series.
you ve been rocking it lately  melonie. thank you for all you do. and thank you for always sharing jesus on social media.
you dropped some absolute bangers this week  melonie - especially tuesday s video. thanks for a week of such great content
the game was already phenomenal.  i felt that this was one of the few things that the game was missing
that s a shame  it s missing that edge. i felt the character was kind of bland because of the choices seemed a bit soft
sounds like something they scrapped out of time constraints  because this is something i think most players would like. i like it when npc s react to how you behave in game and comment upon your actions.
nothing worse than a game s morality system punishing you  because you want to have fun playing an evil character  by cutting quests shorter and rewarding less experience because of it.
could you imagine if  after a certain point  you could actually get such a bad reputation  you could join the other side and bring their evil plans to fruition  all while fighting students and teachers!
i m sure they had to cut a lot of things but now that they got in a sense of how the gaming community has reacted and what they liked and didn t like i m sure the sequels going to be 10 times better. they are already hiring for their next project and they would be stupid not to have a sequel come out around the same time as the new harry potter series.
my thought was actually it possibly being something like the elder scrolls where you have to pay a fine for something if you do immoral things and are caught. obviously  rotting in azkaban forever wouldn t make compelling gameplay  so it would ve been a compromise. i was actually shocked when the game literally doesn t care what you do  even if you break into people s houses and steal their stuff.
once playing it once  going through a 2nd time you see how hollow any choices you make are.  there was such a great chance of this game being more.
it s good to see there are fellow christians that realize that the fairytale magic of harry potter is a completely different thing than actual occult magick.
i still love how sebastian s uncle tries to set two teenagers on fire with incendio and he s supposed to be a sympathetic character.  killing someone instantly vs. slow and painful death via incineration
an open-world game with a proper reputation system would be awesome... the game shouldn t judge you for deciding to play an evil villain  but the characters in the game can and should. for some  you might go up in their estimation!and good evil is way too simplistic...  dangerous  is at least as valid  if you ve duelled well or been seen killing an enemy   or  unpredictable   if you randomly attack people or break things   or  helpful   doing lots of chores side-quests
tears of the kingdom is so awesome! i look forward to what direction you go after the  tutorial  and intro quests.  i went for the master sword right away and a lot of exploring.sounds like hogwarts legacy made the right call. it s morality system sounds a lot like fallout 4 s and the freedom that gives the players.
i would have liked a morality system. it gives consequences to your actions  which makes everything more meaningful. for me  i like helping people in side quests  but i also like to crucio the bad guys that are in the way.
i still play kotor these days  especially ii appreciating the crazy writing of krei.
i wish i could have convinced my team to join me  or at least avoid killing them in the first kotor when choosing the dark side  but other than that it was fun.
swtor  in spite of its faults  which aren t many   had a good morality system. i know it was based mostly upon what faction your played  but they adapted it better than most.
i was a goody goody sith boy
@cog  mass effect 1 2 and 3 has it too and pretty good and sometimes quite scary
would have been hilarious to see my character slowly turn into voldemort or something similarily weird
that would take effort though
but what if i help the old lady across the street by pushing her into a furnace
@neme5i5snake001  lmao
all of them probably had really sheltered lives  they don t understand evil. in real life evil is not some flame breathing dragon or a villain that wants to destroy the world  evil in real life is basically selfishness taken to the extreme  you do what you want without carrying about others and how you hurt them  physically or emotionally. that s real evil  human evil has a purpose  and it s usually based on basic needs and capital sins  lust  greed   envy.
@guillermo el nino  not even effort  just someone with basic life experience
@neme5i5snake001  guess it s a wash then lol
helping an old lady into the furnace
i prefer faction reputation systems for this very reason.
it s bad for gameplay
well  i remember there was a study years ago that said that people who enjoyed dark and gruesome media tended to have higher morality scores.
melonie irl  evil needs to be punished.melonie in game  eeeeeviiiiil!!!
@laytonaster  ever notice how the actors who tend to play villains in movies all the time are the nicest people in real life
@grizzled  grizzly  it s fun to be the opposite of what you are in real life in video games or acting because you re living out in the fantasy world imagine doing things you d probably never do in real life
@alexander mordekai  i disagree  human evil is without purpose. just hurting others around you simply because you can  not to necessarily gain anything.
@al malone  some people live for and find purpose in pleasure.....no matter what it is derived from.
@al malone  and you base that on what  i base my view on life experience and experience within organized crime. they always rationalize their actions and in their mind they even see themselves as victims. and they do it for money  nobody wants to go to jail just because they felt like beating up someone  unless they had to.
out of all the games out there i would say metro has the best morality system  which determines whether or not your character lives or dies in the end.
@alexander mordekai don t forget ego and pride. that s usually what leads to the worst downfall
hahahahaha.
play some fable
@tevin thomas  fable 3 is on my  to play  list
@fredashay klavierstein  fable 1 is the best for me the story nice masterpiece
@tevin thomas  yes  fable 1 was really good!
not so much the new games compared to the old games.
you can be a fucking cannibal in fo games
which is why hogwarts would never have allowed a neutrality system into it. it s too  moral  for modern  audiences   and i say that as someone whose spent way too much time playing hogwarts legacy
me too i loved this game but a couple of students. well... lol
@the boss wolf  avada kedavra
heck  for all we know wb via hbo will do a show covering hl era story   some characters.  they would be stupid to not try.  people love it  it wouldn t step on lore at all via the 7 main original books  etc
@none of your business  too bad it will probably be based on new tv show harry potter  and not original movies or books  so basically every major character will be race swapped to black except baddies who will obviously stay white  lmao.
@none of your business  i d like to see hl continue with years six and seven for the same characters.
@maxine  jkr is involved in the new show and the reason for the new show is that she wants it to delve into the things that were cut or changed in the films.  i m hoping they give ron back his moments.
@mad_amos  agree....can even do a game after all that dealing with london life after graduation
@mad_amos  but didn t they already confirmed that hermione will be race swapped  so yeah  it s already a failure to me.
like lotr it s not demonic or evil it s just fantasy made by very creative imaginative people for the sake of fun and escapism.
agreed  i had to push with the mother of my child to be able to read the books to him. very worth to me  pick ur battles boys and girls
while she probably didn t because she kinda just says whatever she feels like  rowling claims to have done occult research for spell names and such. i can detach it from reality since it s very clearly just a silly fun time  but it was her saying those things that set off red flags when the books were released.
you can put a dress on a pig. it s still a pig. but hey  everyone s entitled to fool themselves  i guess.
because god see s  magic  different than occultism  right
@kiefsti  it s a fictional universe with different systems and rules  bro.
@duncan mcokiner  god doesn t care   bro .
@kiefsti  about fictional universe  yeah problably not. so why do you
@duncan mcokiner  nice twisting my words. i care as a christian  for other christian s.
actually  he tries with fiend fyre not simple incendio.  fiend fyre in game makes the fire tornadoe  movies shaped like giant snake  bird  etc.....fiend fyre is 100  dark magic per books and is a very painful slow death compared to ak painless quick killing curse.    uncle deserved what he got...not even allowing a suffering kid to have some fruit.
@kiefsti  no you don t. you re out here trying to act superior to everybody else in public like one of the pharisees  and you re picking at something that doesn t matter whatsoever to anybody normal.
@              that would be instant divorce if she did that.
@duncan mcokiner  you can think what you choose  magic in h.potter is still occult.
we can all agree that god understands nuance  right  i mean he made us  he has a sense of humor.
@that guy fawkes  actually jrr tolkien was a devout catholic and pretty much the entirety of lotr can be seen as an allegory for the teachings of christ.
@nousos  of course. god knows all. which would mean he also knows what you mean when you create fictional settings such as these.
ain t escapism also wrong as well. i thought you folks advocate intellectualism.
@el perro del autumo  in what world is escapism wrong
i very much enjoyed this game. it just sounds like they had a lot of neat ideas such as a companion system where you can take a classmate on a quest. i think they ran out of time or something to execute these mechanics.
they made such a big deal about unforgivable curses but my kill count as a student is through the roof. i needed a morality system to make it mean anything.
i have been a huge fallout fan since the first game  and have been a fan of karma morality systems ever since. the removal of these systems is just another result of a movement away from a society where consequences matter and shame social pressure helps enforce positive community involvement and acceptable behaviors that support the healthy organization and operation of the body politic.
the problem with morality systems in games is it s always a fake choice  it s never handled well. they inevitably force you to be lawful good because anything else  even not necessarily evil but just chaotic  comes with only negatives  and only the lawful good route has benefits.
imagine if the morality system gave you the  evil route  which would end in you having a story line leading to you killing the headmaster
there s only 36 talent points. if you don t spend 10 points for the dark tree it frees up points for the other tress.  however the dark arts spells are particularly powerful. if you don t go dark arts you need to use potions more to compensate.
morality systems in games are integral to the experience  particularly in rpgs. it has to be done well though  and can depend on how you see it. some people for example  don t like playing mass effect renegade because you can lose content  particularly squad mates and payoff interactions by the 3rd game. on the other hand of that argument is that  well  that s the very thing that gives a morality system it s stakes.
i really like the expulsion idea. no need to strictly be  a student  after a certain point in the plot anyway. you d miss out on spells  potentially  but that could be seen as a consequence of getting yourself kicked out.
i love the idea of a morality system! make everyone in the game world fear your existence! and let them revel and stew in their hatred! wahahaha!  this was an awesome video melonie! stay the mighty beautiful lioness that you are!
morality systems can be really hamfisted but the best version i ve seen of it is in red dead 2. the whole final chapter really puts in a ton of effort in making your choices feel impactful  probably because you know your character is dying.
one of the bad things about the game is how apparently forgivable  the unforgivable curses are.  you can use them in front of teachers and aurors with nothing more than a brief line of dialogue saying not to do that.  the interview quotes are showing how much the game devs were trying to appeal to the post-modern   that s like your opinion  man  twitter users.
there should at least have been a reputation system where some characters would dislike any particular action but others would agree and like your approach.  that s more realistic than a simple  good evil  morality system and an interesting choice would be to unlock additional conversations and side quests depending on how you behave.  it definitely seems bizarre that there are  unforgivable curses  in the game but nobody has any reaction or response to you using them.
i heavily exploited the morality system in kotor 2. my first playthrough was a light side lightsaber specialist  the 2nd was a dark side force power specialist. guess which was way more powerful
i hope this is something they include in the next game.  i d love the same level of freedom of exploration we got in this game  but a lot more rpg elements.things like being able to interact with fellow students and teachers and develop unique relationships that will allow the game to unfold in varying ways.  also a lite school simulation would be excellent
i m certain that morality systems have been explored before. wasn t star wars knights of the old republic one such game where your choices affected what alignment you ended up in love your setup and the updates to your background  melonie mac. go boom!
i definitely have difficulty being bad in games. i recently started dragon age ii  which has a friendship system where the characters in your party judge you by your actions  and i ve already had to reload quicksaves a few times because i didn t want to make my team mad lol.also  infamous is fire  that game got just about everything right.
im glad you covered this as i was looking forward to this game but never bought it when i found out you can be evil... commit the unforgivable curses and still have the same ending. having different paths  outcomes would of been so good. now ill never play this game
infamous 2 let you bring your character from 1 into the game  so it let you begin automatically with good or bad alignment. another plus is you get to start with a few lower tier powers unlocked right away.it was pretty awesome
i think they should have kept the reputation system. make it not too punishing and just chuckle at the people talking bad about you.i guess it could get annoying if certain quests were blocked off due to rep  but the devs could just alter it for different difficulties- make it just npcs get an attitude with you on the easiest mode  dp.s. melonie  thanks for telling us about your upcoming kick streams
aw that would have been pretty cool  but one in like fable where it affected you and reactions with people! i like games that have morality systems  it helps you create a character  and get even more immersed! but after watching more of the video  if the game instantly ended  i would have been annoyed. different outcomes  again like in fable  would have been really fun! it s probably why i enjoyed fable so much back then  because you could be as good or bad as you wanted.
heck add in side quests hunting down books   possible tutors...negotiating with said tutors to even have favors owed to them for sharing knowledge.
if the expulsion did not   game over  as it would have  then i would agree
@none of your business  sounds like a mod project for when the game is fully patched...
i ve been playing an enchanter for the first time  really  in everquest project 1999  basically classic everquest with 1st 2 expansions .everquest has always had a  faction system . it was based upon a lot of factors  your race species  your class  your starting city  and your religion.and a lot of things are affected by your faction. which greatly affects how i play my enchanter moreso than my other characters  because in addition to my other spells  i have a line of illusions   so i can pose as other races species monsters  and travel to any player city... provided all my factions are positive. it affects the quests you re offered and how difficult they are  it affects buying and selling. it even affects some armor and weapons you can use. in the past  regardless of my character class  i always worked for positive faction with the  good  factions. like getting my iksar  lizardman  monk liked by the humans in their territory  or doing quests that gain me faction with the priests of life  cleric guild . you have to be careful  because usually a positive faction for one is a negative for another  and you can get yourself kos in your own home town. no matter what i ve done  the followers of the druid deity  tunare  hated my iksar monk. again  this makes the game interesting  fun and dangerous.one of the main transport destinations is the beginner area for the halflings called  misty thicket . by killing a massive amount of a certain group of monsters  my iksar monk is actually the highest positive faction with the guards in misty thicket  and the halfling town  rivervale ... but there s a druid in misty thicket that s higher level than players can be  right there at the entrance to the newbie area  and who runs a path through the area... who follows tunare because she s a druid.  oh how i hate ella foodcrafter . my rambling point is  a  morality  or faction system can be a major enhancement to game play  especially where grinding out xp is concerned.
sometimes you just want to let loose and have some reckless fun  and the rules be damned.  keep making the great videos mel and good.
could you imagine if they kept it. i bet they would have a secret background code in it to send a report to the government of who did this and on which play through
i think they wanted to make the first game to be free of consequence so you can be as evil as voldemort without consequence  lets face it  like the minitry of magic could stop him . maybe the other games that will come out will have it but i think it was kind of fun to fling curses with no one to stop me xd.
my only problem with most morality systems is that things that would be funny or just sarcastic give you bad rep. if my life was a game  no one would like me... wait a minute...
getting expelled would ve been interesting if there were ways to squat with friends or live homeless on campus  or maybe even unlock quests where you try to get the expulsion overturned or even forged documents that got you reinstated.
infamous and fable are both system sellers for me  partly due to the morality system. i like my actions to have a meaningful effect in the game. hogwarts legacy could ve been so much more  but i still enjoyed the game for what it was.
i like games with a morality system  i also like trying to be an evil character for my 1st playthrough and then good character on my 2nd playthrough. i was annoyed at playing  lord of the rings  fellowship of the ring  they kinda added a morality system and if you are trying to be evil you eventually see the ring wraiths get you and you have to start all over  so they kinda force you to be good.
the game literally encourages you to break into people s homes and steal their stuff  so it might be a bit difficult to implement a morality system. i still would have liked to feel some sort of weight behind my actions though.
for me having a choice of morality adds to the replay value of the game.  you probably heard that the future of gaming will have something like chatgpt.
i ve never been good at being bad in video games. even rdr2 i got the  blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness   ending.it just feels bad doing too many bad things. i tried rampaging on gta3 and i just don t like running people over for no reason. i did play the no russian mission in  mw2 once  and it made me sick to my stomach. but i am also a 9 11 veteran.
i always thought it was funny that there was a student running around blatantly using unforgivable curses and killing people and no one even said anything about it
in fable ii i had several affairs  at the same time  just to experience the repercussions without actually committing adultery. fable ii was harder for me with that playthrough. as it should be  like it would be in real life.
morality systems are terrific  however i agree with a few other commenters that many such systems would benefit from a little more nuance. i think there should be consequences for evil selfish behavior  if it gets caught  at least .
to be fair  a game with morality that actually punished you hard for being a jerk would be a funny thing.
you re makin  some awesome material here. keep goin
i swear melonie content is butter smooth like lara s new buddy in the back.
this all sounds like it would be a great expansion that i would purchase.
i think it s nice to have a system that doesn t judge you for doing good evil things but i imagine there was a problem with that system which was why they removed it  i really wish we had morality in games again yeah it s been boiled down by other games into just red or blue ending but some games do a great things with thay system.
maybe they ll have it in the next game i hope they have more persona-like mechanics for classes in the next one as well.
the motto of dungeon keeper by bullfrog...  it is good to be bad ...i miss the pre-2010
if they had this system  it would encourage me to use curses. the only reason i haven t is that they are only for combat  and the game doesn t seem to care that i use the most forbidden thing in the world.the morality system of kotor improved it and made it so much more fun
i love me a good morality system  that s why i always loved elder scrolls. i m replaying morrowind right now  on the openmw engine  and i m being really evil. it makes the game fun when there are real consequences to your actions in the digital world.
glad you plan on getting back to playing  can t wait to see more videos of  biggitarmy causing problems!
i wish there was more free will to be mean to people in character dialogue or to have disdain  disgust  or distrust instead of being nice and acting there is nothing wrong with certain characters that disgust me. like a rockstar  bully  game mixed with harry potter.  i actually stopped playing legacy once i realized there wasn t really much of an impact for my choices in the long term but that it was just a linear game. i wanted my interactions with others to have unique consequences.
but what if the sequel read your previous save and changed the story a bit for an evil playthrough
if they didn t want us to feel judged  they wouldn t have cressida blume talk about how she never should have trusted me every single time i pass her in the castle.did a better job of making me regret extorting her than any karma meter.also   bullying and extorting  was on the same level as the imperious curse  i m guessing that was a first draft situation
considering how much controversy there was around people being  judged  by the game  im not surprised it was scrapped.
i would have loved it. they could have probably had a way to turn it off if you didn t want it. but i would have loved to do a play through where i was evil and people judged me on it.
i cant wait to see your play through of totk. that game is soo good  im just goofing off  in the depth but its alot of fun.
i like playing bad at times. it s so fun. you look amazing. i hope you have a great day  melonie
infamous was an amazing game. one of the few my dad got into and we could bond over.
i just finished playing this game for the first time like last week  ps4   i thought the game was actually a lot of fun - but yeah  i really did get the feeling that some kind of morality system had been cut or something  i thought maybe my decisions would be counted towards the house points or something. but nope lol.and like  literally  you can learn all the unforgivable curses  steal from  abuse and insult people all you want - you can even send the guy who taught you the unforgivables to azkaban  but there s no real downside to any decision in the game. it would have been way cooler with a morality system i think  i mean how great would it be if you were doing a questline and whether or not you had actually used an unforgivable curse in front of other wizards witches school mates gave different results. like maybe you pass the mission but now you have a black mark and i dunno  both aurors and dark wizards are tracking you or something  and it s kind of like a mix between the gta stars  the mass effect paragon renegade system and maybe something like shadow of mordor s  rival  system for both dark wizards goblins and auror s who track the player  you can fight them  scare them off  talk them into working for you instead  etc.that would have been badass lol and you could literaly become your own dark lord that way by building your own army of followers! or you could be just like dumbledore or harry and build your own army of lightside followers - my only other complaint about the game really is there was no patronus charm  feels like a shame... but who knows  maybe one day we ll get some dlc.
the game was awesome only wished it was more challenging and wished it did have a morality system
i would love to do bad things to villains  be the antihero.  have the npcs give you information in a nervous matter   please don t hurt me...  or reading you the riot act over  the mess your tactics made.
i cried laughing at  chaotic hufflepuff
it was a good decision. with those penalties choice is removed and everyone would be a goody two-shoes. it s like deus ex. they made a big fuss about how you could approach any situation three ways. stealth  hacking or guns blazing. then they added two achievements worth 200 points  one for playing the entire game without killing anyone  and one for playing the entire game without being spotted by enemies or security cameras. so... stealth it is then.
i really enjoyed rdr2 s morality system. you help someone   morality points. you rob someone  -morality points.i think this system only becomes a problem when your developers have questionable morality. where they are incapable of understanding good and bad actions.that should be concerning as fans.
but would you lose points if you only used unforgivables on goblins
i first thought it was the messaging app  but then i found out they are spelled differently. can t wait for streams on kick. i ll be sure to jump and say hi when i m not too busy. god bless you mel.
morality would have been cool. i went from persona 5 to this game  and the thing that disappointed me most was that being out of bed at night had no repercussions  and that you didn t have to work around a school schedule. think the persona 5 system where you only have a certain amount of time each day to do things and you had to spend time in class each day would have been a cool system for hogwarts too. but i also dropped the game and am playing tears of the kingdom before getting back to the game. you should upload clips of your steams to youtube or rumble. i d watch that.
a morality system would ve been amazing
i was wondering why the house points system was never expanded upon and utilized. tied to the mortality system.  sneaking around the school at night and doing unforgivables is a great way to lose points. also the morality system wouldn t be the devs judging players  it would be the social rules and characters in the game judging your actions  which they already have a veneer of doing  but then now it means nothing. i think it would have added needed depth to the game  an additional challenge to not spam the unforgivables which are op spells. plus seeing the points hour glass fill up would have been fun! but they took it away. you always win the  house cup. it s pretty shallow. if that was on the line  then oh no  you re being judged for being murderous and breaking rules  woe is you! if you want the cup  then be a good noodle. literally why the house cup exists for students  as a social incentive to be good and helpful in exchange for prowess  and making it competitive so it s not just a given. society needs more incentives for people to be good to eachother  not less.
i love that lara found a giant stick of butter to snack on
occam s razor   simplest answer most likely answer   it along with other things like taking companions along on non main quests   quiditch  etc have been found in the coding....meaning there were plans for lots more but they were unable to deliver on those and get the game out on time and working properly.  it had one of the least glitchy roll outs of a game in decades.  they made the right choice.  the assumption it was done to not be judgy is a made up tin foil hat thing and nothing official said by anyone at avalanche or wb.  they rolled out one of the top games in decades with very few glitches... kudos to them.
i think my favourite games to play as an evil character in with a morality system were fallout 3 akd new vegas.things like murdering mr house and taking over the casino or blowing up megaton and letting ghould over run tenpenny tower  chef s kiss lol
imagine having a choice   consequence system in your rpg  why i never...lol
could have just released it and put in an on and off toggle if they were so hard pressed about it. i say morality tracking is always good in game. helps the role playing aspect.
this is close to what bully was like  i really wanted something like that in the game
if you get the avada kedavra mastery talent  then you can insta-kill all cursed enemies with one shot!  unlimited powah . combine that with the imperio mastery which will make any possessed npc s attack to another npc curse them  and hey  you re gonna have some fun there. unfortunately  my wizard is already at such a powerful level  that i hardly get to experience this talent since most enemies just die after a few shots. i do use all potions  lol  and the maxed out thunderbrew is an absolute blast. anyway... i will be creating a third wizard now and be a complete a  hat to the npcs.on the subject of morality  what would have been a good implementation of that system would have been if your  standing  would have increased with a certain kind of group  say the slytherin. so maybe interactions with those would have been seen more positive. i mean this whole quest line with sebastian is about the morality of using those spells. surely there are other slytherin who feel the same as he does right. enough. back to making potions and growing plants. nice video!
i ll be honest i just want to play the game anyways. morality systems are fun  but if the game is enjoyable then that s what really matters.
i enjoyed hogwarts legacy but i want a in depth morality system
i thought this game would be like dragon age in terms of choice making  where every house would give you a very different experience and many endings. but nah guess not
i think my main problem with morality systems in the game is that it is the morality system of the devs  not the world itself  and the vast majority of people who make games don t have the time or interest in actually exploring morality. they basically stop at  for the greater good  being  good enough  and anything that doesn t work towards that is  evil. i really love for instance when in pathfinder  if you choose to get paid for your help  you are evil. or  when you have the ability to be evil  it s always some petty thing instead of actual evil. or  when you want revenge against someone  that s good  because the person was bad in the dev s eyes  but saving someone is bad  because the person you saved was a bad person in the dev s eyes .there s no nuance in the morality systems of most games.
question this morality system... is it similar to the world character tendency system of demon s souls
i m glad it s scraped. i was a good alignment slytherin and used that strong dark arts build. it s the same reason my favorite starwars character is mace windu. being a good guy that can use dark powers is awesome and fun.
_  my oc just does whatever she wants  she s a good person and a total sweety but yeah she as a  kill or be killed  thing with her since it seems people are just out to get her. she  s chaotically good and for some reason after getting her glasses is shocked that trees have leaves.
i never chose to be use evil curses  even as a  chaotic neutral  type  i m ok with the morality system being scrapped
hey melonie! great to see a new video you look incredible today  love the hair. have a great weekend.
i would ve rather the morality system. i do play the game to be immersive  and having consequences for being bad would actually be rather good!
would ve been cool that you could get expulsed from the school for being evil enough and then start up a death eaters group and start terrorizing the world.
this is the perfect game for something like a morality system smh. that could have been huge in this game especially between picking slytherin  or hufflepuff. or being able to use dark magic and stuff. akin to how kotor did thiers
being evil without effect or consequences  takes the fun out of pretending to be bad... only actually bad people would enjoy it more with no repercussions...
yeah  the game could have used a  genocide the goblins  option. would have been hilarious.
star wars  the old republic has a great moral system.if you re a jedi you can literally choose to act on the dark side and your physical appearance will change and become corrupt.just because you want to be sith in a video game doesn t mean you would kill younglings in real life.
on the topic of overeating in fable 2  being at max fat made selling price increase  due to unattractiveness which was temporarily reversed with bewitching stone .
if we re not allowed to judge what is evil and wrong  there s something wrong with that gaming company. so basically that s like saying we shouldn t judge pedophiles  rapists  murderers and so on.
can t wait for the sequel.
i did hear something about a sequel  maybe they ll get over the dumb  it s too judgemental to have a morality system  idea and let people have some fun.
i prefer how it is now  i can prance around on my thestral mount without villagers point at me yelling unclean! all day.
nintendo should have added a morality system for tears of the kingdom.
why would they dumb down the morality karma system. infamous was awesome because of that  and i loved it in jedi knight.
good is just a point of view anankin.  that s basically where our society is.
all the fallout games had a great morality system and it s just fun to be bad. also in hogwarts legacy i am about 34  done evil good. depends on who am i t talking too. but then again dragon age origins had a very nice evil system that was great to play.
i think that being evil should expel you from hogwarts. it s more true to the world. the fun would be not getting caught.
i m honestly kind of tired of my character being always so nice
have a great weekend melonie mac! looking very stylish!
with the kick thing  you have the choice between woke  twitch  and grifter   con artist   criminal  heck the owner still has a suit case going on right now  becouse he wasn t paying his  ex -employe   kick
the games industry want to tell you your a bad person me  in games i always the most vile person imaginable because i know id get my arse handed to be faster then that speed of light if i did the same acts in real life.
scrapping the morality system from hogwarts legacy if i m being honest.whenever a game has a morality system like the undertale games i usually choose the pacifist route because 1. i love the characters too much to kill them2. i am one of the few people who prefers hopes and dreams save the world over megalovania
irl melonie mac   love thy neighbor virtual melonie mac   it s a dog eat dog world lol!
im so sick of devs projecting their emotional and mental fragility on other people. just because they have the mental strength of a 2 year old who just had their lollypop stolen doesn t mean that s how normal people think and feel. it s damn sad how pathetic the mental strength of people is these days.
in retrospect  it s just as well this was passed over. given the - reception - to the game s release  not attempting to convey any strong and detailed message about morality took that off the table as another thing to debate  and the thing about morality systems in games is they never work well implemented beyond the most simplistic level. you ll always find flaws in them if you work at it  and people would have been trying in this case.
idk why game developers shy away from putting a morality system in their games. it would make most games better
you telling me it was supposed to have a fable like appearance changes  that would be wild. maybe in a mod someday
i was disappointing they didn t habe it but it makes sense with the first game i mean if you look at jedi survivor they now have dark more than the first
hey  melonie i just want to say that you are so beautiful and lovely in this video for today and i like your gold tank shirt and your brown curly hair looks great and look beautiful too for today. also i just want to tell you that you are doing a great job  with making these types of videos melonie and i really enjoyed   love and like your bible verses that you shared with us on here on your boom channel and when you posted them on twitter too. keep it up and i really appreciate your hard work that you do for your christian family fans like us melonie. anyway i just don t know why they scrapped the hogswart legacy system for bc it is just a video game and nothing else to it and so i just don t understand why they scrapped it for no reason at all. anyway that is all i want to say about this video for today and i just want to tell you that you are doing a great job with making this videos for us to watch and make comments on your video for everyday melonie. keep it up and congrats to you too. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great weekend too melonie. god bless you melonie.
mass effect trilogy would never been as popular without the morality system.
i enjoyed the morality system in the fable games
the entire game feels like it s on rails no matter what you do. morality would ve been a good addition. too bad it was cut.
oh  that sucks  this would had made the game much better but i still enjoyed it . getting sent too azkaban would of been fun
boomstick  abracadabra!!wiz  avada cadavra.boomstick  oh. . . .that magician wasn t trying to kill me. . . .
mine will most likely head that path as i have almost mastered all the dark arts.
someone will definitely mod this back in.
morality systems are hard though -- take baldur s gate and bg2 -- you literally fall too low and everyone comes after you  the game becomes nearly impossible to complete.
just imagine how crazy melonie would be if she wasnt a christian.
it does bother me that you can rob everyone and they just ignore you.  and you can openly use forbidden magic without an eyeblink from anyone
my very favorite  game over way too early  moment came from the matrix online. you start the game by being unplugged from the matrix  just like neo   then you meet morpheus and get the red pill blue pill option  again  just like neo .you pick the red pill  you create your character  then dive into the game like all the other  red pilled  lemmings.you pick the blue pill  morpheus gives you a brief  sorry for wasting your time!  speech and the game ends.you chose poorly  nerd. make a new character.
just think though this was their first triple a game can t wait for the sequel
side note  i miss the  low rise jeans  trend. these designers today putting the waistband nearly up to the ribcage  what the hell is that all about
this!
lol  after learning alohamora  to unlock locks  i snatched everything not nailed down...but on my 2nd playthrough via a different house i refused to snatch anything from 2 houses....the old lady friend of 3 broomsticks bar owner   the mother   son house   son who got kidnapped.  i ak a ton of people but i do have some standards  ethics
but use flippendo on a cow one time  or was it 10   and every npc knows and won t shut up about it.
sounds like more of the modern game design of hand holding the player  this time through morality choices in game that i despise with the passion of a thousand exploding suns
more important. when did lara get a stick of butter
even red dead redemption 2 has a morality system
haven t watched her in quite a while just clicked on this one and bam! saw melonie.. did she get even more.. gorgeous didn t even know that was possible.
i thought there was something missing   its like your choices dont matter in the game well that how it felt too me
for those who shun morality  responsibly  and consequence  never play ultima quest of the avatar.
omg i can t wait for the streams!
still got lara and the giant butter back there. they must be bonding. great video once again mel. you look gorgeous today.
i tried to be the biggest asshole i could in this game and yet everyone still wanted to be my friend.
so this would ve turned hogwarts legacy into a game like bully
admit it  avada kedaver-ing everything is fun.
maybe they could do something wirh candy you give to chldren to make up for the people you kill
in fallout 4  i sided with the institute. i became queen of the world. i personally killed everyone in the railroad. i took preston with me when i did it.
the house point system was so weak  it rarely came up or ever mattered. having a morality system would have tied a lot of things together. the dialogue choices didn t matter much  keeping random trinkets from side missions didn t gain anything. keeping the unique pets was the only thing mildly useful. this game had so much cut content but still solid overall.
i hate the karma in fallout games because you re being judged without context  new vegas understood this and in that game faction reputation is way more important than karma.so yes  i agreed on not having a good bad judgment
parkay.  the game was solid enough without any morality meter.  the story wasn t about letting you become voldemort  before the real voldemort.
they don t know the gamer rules.  1. try and kill everyone.  2. get on to everything.  3. see how far you can jump before you die.  4. find every glitch in the game.
what  ! ! ! i ve been trying to do my first play through on a good path.
laura croft with the big stick of butter is cracking me up
cant believe you left out kotor 1 and kotor 2 when comes to morality lol
a faction liking or not liking what you do is 1000  better than arbitrary fable morality.
the thing that disappointed me the most  no matter what you do  nobody seems to care.i would like to see it a step further  that you get invited to a death eater sort of group  something like that.
there s a giant stick of butter in the background.  i needed that  so unexpected lol
they always mess up the system. i like it cause it adds to the game  it makes the npcs more aware of the player. rdr for example  you could be in the middle of nowhere but somehow always busted . there should be a rep system  effected only when they see you do something and maybe a separate honour system. cause that is effected irl even when someone isn t looking. the character creation is horrid in legacy.. more so since they constantly refer to your character in awkward ways or the third person. not good at all.
kick was created by an ex amazon employee that uses amazon web servers so don t be surprised if some funny business happens if they start to beat put twitch and then get throttled
being expelled from hogwarts would ve been great. you could team up with the goblins to get your revenge or something. it was a fun game  but it definitely missed out on the chance to be a masterpiece.
kids today seem to be raised to be too fragile for such things
nice one  melonie!
melonie only love can conquer hate. i ll be right over.
im replaying infamous right now... love it
well that s unfortunate  the game would have benefited from a morality system
morality in games doesn t always work like metro to get good karma you gotta not kill everyone. it s a fucking shooter
i ve played the game it is pretty good definitely a 8 10 but it feels  boring to me honestly.
lol  that s hilarious. modern day wickedness causes devs to leave out actual fun mechanic.  we dun wanna judge yew  pshhhh... ok. meanwhile... fable. . . one!
awesome video good job i in joy it thanks for the video i love it have a good day and night
first off  damage points that fly around when you damage people makes any game feel like a shitty mobile arcade game. i can t begin to express how much i hate that. be that as it may  this game is brilliant in the fact that you can   turn off the damage numbers!   this game just keeps on getting better. this looks so good  apart from the bland clay faced characters    but it is just not my thing. i d much rather be up for a well written  non woke cultist propaganda game set in the lord of the rings universe. destruction magics  illusion magics  alteration magics...all of the    controversial     dark magics   is just an everyday thing in skyrim hahaha skyrim is so bleak  i love it.i look forward to having some of these spells modded into skyrim. i despise the illusion of choice in boring flaccid rpgs of late.i would actually relish a grown up version of the game  where you are presented with actual challenges. where you have to fight to survive and you get presented with morally gray choices.for instance being pinned and on the cusp of defeat and death at the hands of a powerful evil entity  your companions   beloved npcs characters are endanger of being killed by this entity and you have to choose to use the unforgivable course to save your loved ones but then you will be reluctantly labeled as    evil  .   containing severe consequences  taking into consideration earlier choices  determines the severity of this   evil   label and its consequences and the likelihood of a successful potential redemption arc. or you choose not to use the unforgivable course  forced to watch your companions suffer and die   to then have a third party come in and defeat the evil entity  perhaps a powerful dragon comes in and dispatches the villain    leaving you morally good but at what cost   imagine if you could choose to go down an evil path and use the unforgivable curses  where you then get hunted by the ministry  sending bounty hunters dementors to capture you and send you to azkaban.but then you get the opportunity through arduous combat to escape azkaban.returning to hogwarts and being treated like a hunted fugitive  force of evil    like mr sinuses  and fighting defeating every student whom doesn t flee in terror   where the professors and dementors become the boss battles.  such moral   emotional dilemmas would be deeply engaging.  if you lose then you get destroyed or if you succeed  you manage to destroy   conquer hogwarts and you launch a new timeline in this universe. becoming the archmage headmaster of a new  dark institute.    that could cause me to buy and play this game.
game over for breaking bad  better call saul legacy
somewhat disappointing given how good many games have been that have had morality systems  kotor  mass effect and various other good rpgs plus also increases replayability least if done well
i d scrap my morality system if she would play with my hogs wart    jk.  love thr show.
digital morality. no killing of bots.
when doing sebastian s quest  i used avada kedavra and crucio when taking down the bad guys to save hi sfamily and nobody batted an eye  then a cutscene plays when seb casts avada kedavra to save his sister and everyone loses their minds and cast him out. i face-palmed at that moment.actually  hogwarts legacy needed that damn morality system badly. the game s choices didn t mean anything and it was utterly disappointing. it might have made the game less boring really.
but seriously the lack of options in design is just sad
well the article said expulsion   game over  so that in fact would not have been good haha! but if that weren t the case i would agree
all of us took the bad rout on in the fable trilogy fallout 3   vegas lol
man that s bs the whole point of being evil is the risk of being punished...that s why it s fun
consequences should only come to you if you get caught. i like games where i get to be the  good guy  in the eyes of important characters while i have the freedom to go around massacring people.
why are you standing now  someone get this woman a chair.
you can t even be bad it that game lol  what a bunch of limp wristed devs. now kotor had a working morality system and that was great!
i need to say there is one evil thing u can do in the game if they did not remove it in the update i would never do that because i love cats u can throw the cat around and someone on youtube throw the cat over a cliff
just looked at kick and it looks like they re literally trying to just be a twitch carbon copy...they already have titty streamers  a bikini category  etc. might be ok for now since their main appeal seems to be giving a higher revenue share  but that will change in a couple years so you better hope they have something else to offer.
that s unfortunate. still a great game though.
i wanted to be the next voldemort
meh. it would have been great if it were more than the usual good-vs-bad dichotomy we usually get. i don t want to choose between smothering a loved one with a pillow and digging through to their femoral artery with a cheese grater  to paraphrase yahtzee.fallout 3  for instance  made a habit of telling the player which choice was good and which was evil  which leads to the choices being between - to borrow once more from yahtzee - getting a little girl s cat down from a tree and tussling her hair as she scampers off  or setting fire to the tree and jumping up and down on her head.can we not have a slightly less binary system  one in which there s more than one right answer
really disappointing  when hogwarts legacy trailer came out i wanted to be an evil wizard... sigh
even though it s the same thing  why call it  morality  which is judgmental rather than just  reputation  which is common is numerous games
i mean i get why people are disappointed...but i love spamming avada kedavra without wizards coming after me lol
sounds like it would have been interesting.
the shadows people lay. stray  don t want to be there. but i think i ll be me. stay easy buck.
i took the good path first.... now i m doing evil. the evil path is more profitable and being slytherin is brotacular. sebastian and ominis make this a slytherin game.
would have been so much better if it had that system  i quit before the last story mission cause it was just boring being overpowered with not morality system in place
oh that could make the game so much more fun  since playing through it just twice.. its kindda already a bit too repetative for me. but if you avada kadavra someone innocent  or abuse any powers you know. or get busted in stealing and unlocking locks  would be able to put you on a hunt list by stronger and stronger wizards  all the way to deatheaters apparate in on you just to kill you xd lets go  d do it  d  p
even true crime streets of la had a morality system of good cop bad cop
thank you so much!!!
@melonie mac go boom   no problem
i m just really trying to figure out what that giant box with  butter  on it is. i can t stop looking at it.
dude! the butter! that s amazing
biggitarmy rise up
considering all the slytherin fans  i may not like it but probably a good call.
consequences like ending up on the back of some dudes head.
i get the  not judging gamers  but if the action you are doing is considered evil or a crime in-universe then i don t see any problem punishing the player accordingly. in fact  it feels off when that consequence doesn t happen  since it conflicts with what people expect in the game s universe. as far as the game over  that would have been dumb  but i feel like the only thing you can do in hogwarts legacy worthy of expulsion is the evil spells. as the game is now there are not that many opportunities to perform these spells in front of school staff anyway  and doing them in front of other students you could explain away with them just not snitching on you and covering for you. they absolutely could have implemented a cool morality system without  judging  players or having a game over for being too evil.
what s the purpose of wielding reality-warping powers if you can t turn those who annoy you into a blob fish joking aside  video games are not a substitute for raising children with a moral compass. people need to let video games be the entertainment they are intended to be.
been playing a villain basically..
lol! so that is why you were still a good little hufflepuff. i was wondering why your character was nice all the time.
tom riddle is just a vanilla boy compare to me
look  i m sorry for bringing up the zoomer  tumblr  quirky  earthbound-inspired-indie-rpg  but a comparison to undertale is inevitable. one of the biggest things that helped undertale stand out is how much the game reacts to your actions. to the point where a genocide run effectively changes the game into a slasher horror from the killer s perspective. it was chilling  it was horrifying  it made you feel like a monster but it was effective and intriguing. hogwarts legacy removing consequences from evil actions doesn t help the players do whatever they want without being judged or feeling uncomfortable  it just makes all the evil choices and options pointless and makes the game s world feel less alive  involved and real.
the guardian   review bombing  is now dismissed as being bots.thats wonderful- i don t think so. thats actually like classifying it as cyber-terrorism. what about people just don t like something  oh no  that can t be true!
yeah  they pussied out on that one.
the complete lack of any morality system is  besides the hopelessly incompetent porting devs  part of the whole game. makes replay ability 0  besides the 3 other achievement for doing another house .and it is so stupid since you have 4 houses with 4 potential different playthrough  but nope. besides for one quest for each house its the same no matter wtf you want to do. i was looking forward to do my first  normal  playthrough then do my  gone full bad . so disappointed when there was no such option. even choosing  the wrong  option on dialogs have no consequences what so ever.
didn t red dead redemption have an honor system in both games  so what is bad about honor system or morals in game s
assuming you haven t played it  i think you d like red dead redemption 2. best morality system i ve seen
i am getting fiber internet...ohh  that one i just cant let go. dont you need to be vegan for that morality systems in games are usually horrible yet to see one good one . they force players to paly in certain ways to reach desired result  rather than just enjoying game without pointless restriction. while it would be possible to make proper extensive morality system  it would bloat game to enormous size  as they would need to code for every option  every outcome  every consequence... so better not to have at all  let players roleplay  thats the point  rather than having shitty ones.
... was that giant stick of butter there before  lol
they can always reinstate it  and they should. game makers need to stop being such p ssies. gamers are the people who call eachother f gs online for fun  we re not going to  feel bad.  being evil in a game doesn t make you evil in real life  and so what if the in-game characters  try to make you feel bad  for your choices  you ve evil.... it s par for the course  and it s part of the fun. it adds more replayability as well. i remember replaying mass effect and fable multiple times back-to-back just to see what i d look like by the end. was not disappointededit  wow  okay  so hearing mel explain it  and from my playing the game  what they did was allow you to get the curses etc. and use them  bribe and bully people  with no consequences for your evil actions.... that s unrealistic  and sends terrible messages. so  how is that better  and yes expellation unlocking evil wizard missions would have been awesome. join the dark side
zelda tears of the kingdom  make u become a warlord
it s a pool float.
@joseph crabtree  right on  thanks. mel s got a pool  that rocks.
@vincent werts  no idea on the pool. but its a butter stick pool float.
@joseph crabtree  i see. i feel silly. why does this exist
did you even watch my gameplay or....  because i picked all the bad options
@melonie mac go boom  lol! i did. you were ruthless to a  t   but there is no moral system. so  if there is no moral system within the game  were you truly ruthless  you still became a good little hufflepuff in the end after all that hard work at being ruthless. lol!
@melonie mac go boom  - btw  i am just joking with you.
i beat that game and streamed it when it first dropped  so good!
most morality systems are super superficial
i don t respect that decision. what is this self insert cringe  never once did i hate lionhead devs for how an npc reacted to me for sacrificing 10 innocent merchants in a row to skorm in the middle of darkwood in fable 1. why would anyone think that way
i love being evil in spider-man web of shadows game  and like being evil others games  too
if you love morality systems  you should try out tyranny. tl dr  you re the dark lord and you won. now how do you govern the world you just conquered  do you want to be cruel-but-pragmatic  ruthlessly mad with power  or just a dick for the sake of being a dick
i played nice with the curses lol
it s my biggest criticism of the game. the fact that its a superficial rpg in everyway. your choices barely leave a dent in the plot.
ah too bad  i enjoy morality systems in games.
game is really good. but was very annoyed and put off by removing gender from the player. everyone else in the game is adressed by their genders  besides one obvious self insert character . i d roll my eyes when in the story people address you as  they . so in a way they force your character to be a force counterfit gender. i m a fucking wizard. wizards are men boys. i don t hate trans people. i think they need treatment. i m subbed the blaire white and she s probably one of the only trans people i ll call by their  prefered  pronouns. she doesn t deny reality and even she says that system in the game is bullshit.
i ddnt get how a dot was badand spoke a languageespecially in the firstgrand theft autoa character so you could barely see ithired to do this that and the other
morality is not subjective. it s really easy to make a system once you know natural law. these creators obviously don t understand the laws of the universe
i had alot of fun bullying the other students.
8 20 play far cry 3 the main character kills so much to survive he becomes and everyone judges him
shame. the reaction of the world is what makes being evil in game worth doing. just look at mass effect or...well infamous.
i like gta for the chaos
look at that butter in the background.
that would have been awesome
why is lara with a huge stick of butter
let me be racist against goblins and i might play the game
my boo thang poppy loves my bad boy character
off topic did u see the crap that sf 6 is getting with cammy they revamped her to please the woke people. but then there are releasing he original costume with dlc the woke people going nuts because they sexualised cammy as they say. they dared to have an attractive character
hi melonie the game ultimate spider-man you can play as spider-man and the evil side aka venom on the ps2 thoughts ! ps  great video
sorry i m late. i was drinking water.  and shopping.  remember to drink water. stay safe. take care. have fun.  everyone have a wonderful day.
but would be wierd that would be  that evil and the school would let you stay
that s a shame.
hope u talk about alan wake 2 going woke.
i just want to boink bellatrix tbh
the og fable on the og xbox
that s a big stick of butter
can we get an f in chat for melonies heart. all that meat and butter. can anyone say heart attack my 40
they took it out because it makes no sense anyway. oh  you ve killed people  well  we ll have to take away points from your house  that s shit stupid.
that s sad
where s the mod that brings this back
you thinking about diablo 4 at some point
turf nation homegirl.
good  i m glad.  morality systems are junk when the people making them are out of touch with morality.
i haven t bought it. i might if mojang gives me reason to update my xbox x s.
gta  hogwarts!
for the algorithm.
i was just talking about this with my girlfriend.
they should have removed them spells because we cant be evil just a asshole thats not the same
this is why i ended up not liking the game. sure the gameplay is fun but there is no morality  no police system  belonging to a certain house is irrelevant at the end of the day  the world does not change or adapt around you. bully had a better school system then this game and it was a better closed school experience overall than this
honestly you should try some smash or something you d do good
can you act bad or evil
where cara dune  did you threw her into garbage can
quick mod it in
hl has to be the most liberal game i ve ever seen. removing judgement for being bad in a video game.. lmao this gaming industry is shit now
u cant be evil people need to stop saying that u can only be a asshole thats not evil i think the cures dont make sense in the game u cant be evil what is the point in them spells
you look good in orange.
what like red dead that would be so cool
rip. another game made significantly worse for no good reason
probably for the best this the choice is mine none of that undertale bs.

the losers are gonna take the ima bigot out of context lol
i like your butter
hi boombastic!
scrapped it for fear of ppl being judged  omg it dies sound fun. anyone who gets butt hurt for being judged is a snowflake. i recently finished hogwarts. much as i liked it. morality system coulda been great
biggit army assseeemmmbbbllee
game looked good but it was boring....stopped playing after like 11 hours. not to mention the stuttering on pc.
would jesus do an evil playthrough.... i didn t think so
that s a lot of butter
you like to be bad yea
every mission with sirona i had to skip   her  voice was so damn annoying. also i hate how your character is a they them  even if you make a boy or girl.
butter
why would you care about other people s opinions there so many. most people online never grow up so they get annoyed over the most trivial things. just enjoy life instead of bitching about every little thing.
ooh  you re such a bad young lady. i was a good little boy on my first hogwarts run. 2nd run   not so much. avada kedavra anything and anyone that moved on the slytherin run.
can u pin deez.
first!  -
first
you was evil in the game   and you call yourself a christian   how would jesus play hogwarts
