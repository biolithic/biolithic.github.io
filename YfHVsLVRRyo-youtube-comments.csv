the hanna barbera partnership was one of the most harmonious and solid in animation history. they would be utterly distraught by what s happening to their creation now. their children and grandchildren must be far from impressed to say the least.
imagine being in a time where scrappy doo is no longer the most hated thing about scooby doo.props for the ren   stimpy reference. that brings back memories
i m so tired of my childhood being ruined
scrappy is now adorable compared to velma. velma is now a hated character. also i thought it was hilarious when you said that velma season 2 would be a tax wright off!  great video today melonie! it s great to see you doing videos again. you look amazing too!
the tax right off guess is not that far off  melanie  apparently there s this social score thing that determines how  progressive  companies are  and the higher it is the more business and clout you get  which may contribute to the woke garbage we re getting .i hope this helps and one more thing  i am one of the few people who actually liked scrappy.thank you for another great video melanie  and have a magnificent day everyone  god bless
hanna-barbera would never imagine scooby-doo becoming this. i grew up with good cartoons in the 70s   80s   and 90s. we never thought about cartoons turning into today s generation.
velma getting a 2nd season is a great example of how stupid the  entertainment  industry is.
her point about being careful about what your kids are watching is spot on.
if it ain t on vhs they shouldn t be watching it.  - melonie mac. i m going to have to start using that.
melonie starting off strong in this!  with some videos  its like 1 minute intro to get into it  but at 5 seconds i am already grinning at that remark
there s never going to be anything as good as a pup named scooby-doo. that show was s tier and the theme song slapped.
i m so glad to see you looking happier  you must be drinking them stalker tears! nothing beats 90 s kids animation  i wish they d bring back some batman beyond lol. great video  bless you and enjoy your day!
og scoobie doo always reminded you that the true evil in this world was other humans
from what i heard the viewership after the first episode of velma fell off a cliff. of course the producers wouldn t admit they put out a crappy product  they took the easy way out and called people  ...ists.  i remember the one line that the villain said at the end of every one of the original scooby doo episodes -  i would have been successful if it hadn t been for those miserable kids!
i think when they say preschool scooby-doo i expect they re making it more like blue s clues than the original scooby-doo.  educational  informative  and entertaining being the supposed goals there.
one of the reasons velma is getting a new season may be because everyone is hate watching so they can be the one to review it for their viewers. we all know that controversy gets views.
i remember hearing velma was getting a 2nd season. if that was true it s because they already have the 2nd season ready to release. they produced one chunk of 20 episodes and divided it in two.    they did that with the harley quinn cartoon. they announced it had been greenlit for a 2nd season. it became apparent it was already in the bag when that premiered a mere 3 months later. they d cancelled a show and needed something for that slot. it got bumped up like 8 months
start of a new week and a fresh new go boom! video from melonie to go with it! yes!!
i always loved scrappy doo hope this project will be better
i agree there is not a lot of family friendly stuff on hbo  however  you might want to check out everwood if you haven t already watched it. really high quality show that is somewhat clean  not exactly christian but it is definitely a far cry from gossip girl or any crap like that.
hanna   barbera and boomerang were prime time childhood teli
when boys were boys and girls were girls
they are too busy purchasing their next yachts
@doug d  they probably are too checked out now they made bank back then
scrappy should have never been  hated . for starters  there were characters like scooby-dum and flim-flam. stuff like cn bumpers and the 2002 live-action movie were large parts of the development of the scrappy  hatedom .
i m right there with you
me too
same...
agree
it isn t ruined just don t watch the new ones  like starwars .  when they start editing the old ones is when it will get crazy.
@fknandt  you should look into those animated shorts they did of the original star wars  where they made leia a badass  who actually had to save luke when escaping the death star
aren t we all
same
star-warsdr.whomarveld.cproud familyscooby-doodid i miss anything
we can agree as well  hey guys kfc next i want that chicken.
be thankful you re an adult now not watching modern-day slop
@some guy on the internet  he-mancowboy bebopmagic school busdisney sequelsspace jam
same.... rugrats especially. and tmnt
amen
you and me both.  it s so tiresome.
me too
you re amazing andrew  thank you so much for the kind words and support
@melonie mac go boom  always for you melonie!
oh jeez.... i forgot about scrappy doo. i hated that character. so annoying.
they would be mortified
there were lots of scooby-clones that came out during that time. even the archie based josie and the pussycats went with the formula. and i ll watch any of them times ten over this nuclear disaster called  velma .
why did the mindy vanity project get an act 2  whose knob is she polishing
people will like what i tell them to like   they seem to say
unless it s that one vhs tape in the back of the drawer that has no label on it
haha thank you  you re the best
thank you so much!
atleast the  harley quinn  show is actually good. if only each season wasn t so short.
@frank kennedy  it s one of my favorite things from last couple years. the look  the distinct humor style that feels right.     velma seems like a new level of terrible  nobody on any side likes it. it s quite an accomplishment
thank you!
@melonie mac go boom always here to support ya in what ways i can
they need to redeem scrappy-doo  and make him a good guy again. and retcon that live-action movie too.
@supersonicwarrior93  ye
i remember watching the original ones as a child. probably when they first appeared.  never felt scared of it as far as i recall.
it would have just been a scooby-doo re-skin of paw patrol.
i think velma is only getting a second season because season 2 was probably far along into production  or possibly even finished  when season 1 debuted. animation takes a very long time to produce.
i watched scooby doo cuz my sister didn t want to watch batman or xmen or the simpsons or shows i liked but it was a fun show.  after seeing pax east  i feel that we are in a entertainment desert in the usa. i drought we will get out of it any time soon but i hope something springs up soon because i am thirsty for some good old times again at the end of each day
as the original theme song said  scoobie-doobie-do where are you  we got another case to solve now.
i have to thank melonie here for teaching me about this woke culture. i spent some time away and it blows my mind what they have done to america.
the creator of velma paid to have 2 seasons right off the bat.
scooby doo fans to scrappy doo  perhaps i treated you too harshly
i miss the 90s so freaking much
7 20 hbo actually has a somewhat decent amount of children s programming. they bought sesame street a few years ago  and are still making new shows with it.  in the past with cable tv  buying hbo gave you about 6 different channels  one of them was  hbo family . it would only ever play family-friendly content. so you could put a parental lock on the other channels  but then leave that one unlocked for your kids and not have to worry about it. i agree though  hbo is most famous for their raunchy shows  and with everything on streaming services now it feels more dangerous to just hand a kid the remote to hbo max  even if you locked it down into kids mode.
velma is getting another season because they actually aren t getting another season. most hbo max half-hour cartoon seasons are 18 to 22 episodes long. velma season 1 is ten episodes long  and so is the second season. from a production standpoint  they took the cost of one season  cut it in two  and call it two seasons.  hollywoodaccounting
glad you pitched in for the grunt style shirt its a team effort after all
4 52 another great melonie moment
shout out to all of those who grew up with a pup named scooby doo!
hey melonie. nice shirt. and oh my goodness more velma. and scrapping another scooby doo. looking forward to the vid
i wouldn t say scooby-doo is inappropriate for  pre-schoolers  but i think it s a bit more complicated than what i ve seen for shows targeted at that demographic. typically  those cartoons have a more simple plot and a cutesy animation style.
there is a way to tell if a company is woke   does the company logo change during the sixth month of the year  if so  it is woke.  i bet discovery is woke.
but not velma.guess hbo max wants to fold which would be fine by me.
oh ren   stimpy! good times. miss those days.
scooby doo has morphed into scooby don t. i m surprised they didn t cancel the show during covid because in the end all the monsters and bad guys wore masks.
saaame!
before disney gotten involved let s go back to marvel s phase 4 remember the serious ragnarok sign yeah that was kind of real scary wasn t. disney signed with marvel we get  some 80 s@ t and it s terrible too many g     jokes people are dying and jokes is the only thing can come up with.  tsuperman and lois discovery can t touch that cause it was already written but let s say wb disconnect from discovery like get out of that contract do you believe things aregoing to get better.
i don t think kid friendly when it comes to hbo max. so red flag to me
cow and chicken super cow is my favorite cause she always whipped thedevil s a   there s still videos online that people can look up thats funny as hell. these sjw videos should be on new grounds no one will give a d   .
nickelodeon during the 90 s wow i was watching  rugrats  - doug - rocko s modern life - kenan   kel   the legend of the hidden temple.
@jonathan sanders  i remember all of those
@jonathan sanders  remember hey dude that was a good one i think there was another 1 called all that before melissa john hart sabrina the teenage witch and skeeter.
@christopher loyd   damn man i do remember salem the talking cat and her witch aunties   and the cousin skeeter the talking puppet. 20 years seems like a forever ago.
it s weird that the scooby-doo projects never have scooby-doo in them.
your new profile picture stands out in my subscription list. i feel like purple shades of it are used by many  but your tilted photo with the hair looks unique and recognizable
that  show was  a perfect  example  of grooming.
another piece of my childhood they want to gut and toss aside.
velma s getting a second season  someone call dante.
there s only a few people i always upvote their video and you re one of them
the next one should be  daphne!  in which the first episode talks of velma going  away  for a while. she is replaced by scrappy-doo. and scooby-doo returns from back packing through europe.
if you go right back to 0 00  her face sums up how she s been feeling about the entire situation
they haven t been eating good  they ve been eating like vegans
hbo max does have the old super friends and batman cartoons from the 60s and 70s.
good afternoon  melonie. hope you have a wonderful monday. you look amazing today ps  did you change something with the light  the brown in your eyes has been standing out so brilliantly lately
when the tv series  dinosaurs was on  we weren t allowed to watch because one of the episodes they talked about killing the grandmother because she reached a certain age. and my parents said that s how it starts  play it off as comedy so it becomes normalized and then it creeps in. there are only a handful of cartoons suitable for kids. maybe the star wars cartoons  maybe a couple of others. i hope all  improves for you irl. god bless
scooby doo ain t getting a scooby snack anytime soon .poor dog!
sarcastic wit is on point today. you seem in better spirits. nice shirt too.
we meddling  kids  were not gonna let them get away with trashing and dunking on scooby doo
it was probably going to teach little kids that it s ok to do drugs  because  it s cannon . so the lawyers were probably the people that cancelled it to avoid lawsuits.
they haven t quite figured out the giggle physics yet
i think the second series of velma is just going to be the second half of series 1
it s a far cry from the supernatural   scooby-doo crossover where velma was basically throwing herself at sam winchester.  how long until someone convinces stimpson j. cat to push the history eraser button
i thought we were done with hearing about velma and her television show series on hbo max  anyway i guess not. also i think that scrapping a new scooby doo project is a great idea bc it would be a awful idea to make if it had velma in it and other character in it with velma  ok melonie. anyway i am happy that hbo max is scrapping the scooby doo project bc it would be a awful and terrible series to have on and to watch. anyway i just wanted to make a comment on this video for today and i just wanted to tell you melonie that you are doing a great job with making these videos everyday for us to watch and make a comment to you for your videos  ok melonie. anyway hope you are having a great day today and hope you continue to have a great day and hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great week too this week.
if the president somehow give this shows director a medal like she just did cpr on him and saved his life  i can honestly say it ll be hard to see it die soon enough.
scrappy doo was far more likable than any characters in the velma show and that s saying somethingseriously that show makes the live action movie with matthew lillard look like zombie island
and i always thought the tellatubbies was a red flag in children s programming.
great video  melonie. i know you ve got a lot going on right now. i m always praying for you. you re always so beautiful
i agree. i havent seen the new stuff so i kinda dont know what your talking about but the original scooby doo is cool
so they ll keep velma because apparently that s doing so well. what in the world is happening at wb  also you were nickelodeon kid weren t you melonie
good reference to scrappy doo .... makes me remember a time ... a better time ... when the consumer said x sucked the business said okay got you and either minimized the use of it or just straight up got rid of it  new coke comes to mind  ....... and nobody got called a nahtzee  racist  phobe or mysogynist over it.
hope all is well with your  technical difficulty .  and remember to drink water. i liked bugs bunny better than scooby-doo. but i m old what do i know.  hahaha
i don t listen to many people talking about tv or movies anymore  your the only one  and your takes are always the best.  but hopefully they don t  don t all the sexuality information with in the new show.   i mean i said it before and i will say it again  but these companies really need to take a page from nintendo s book  because it seems like they are the only ones doing anything the right way anymore.
how in the world did this get the green light for a second season
i m probably wrong  but i have an idea why hbo isn t pulling the plug on velma. velma is able to pull in a lot of views from hate watching. the new show they had initially planned wouldn t have brought in the same number of views.
what really annoys the hell out of me is all the low iqs claiming velma has  always been a gay bi icon  even though her sexuality was never brought up before because she s a fictional character in a television show for kids. i swear  the people that are obsessed with the perceived sexual orientations of fictional characters are downright creepy and just plain weird  and the fact that they will verbally attack people who say otherwise would be funny if it wasn t so sad.
i always thought you had to deliver good work to succeed in this life... not anymore
melonie i havent watched it but do they have the  underground refs  as far as substances go  when the chars are  ruined
no mention of scooby-doo! and krypto too
according to pitch meetings hate watching is the reason why velma got a 2nd season. i don t know about anyone else  but even before wokeness watching one second of a show aimed for preschoolers i felt myself growing dumber. just skip it and give your kids the cool stuff to watch.
i hope we can get another  straight velma  one day  but i have the sinking feeling she s just going to be depicted as outright lesbian from now on. once they   get represented   they never allow things to go back to the way they were.
hello melonie mac good video i liked scrappy doo the little fisty dog who was eager to get in a  scrap hbo max had samaritan starring sylvester stallone a hero movie you get surprised by in a good way. what i am wondering  is you are known for your carnivore diet could you do a suggested menu or list of what you consume to give us an idea of what to buy in a video thank you.
i would personally ignore almost anything that came out after around 2015 when the wokes truly took over...
melonie is extra babely today
thank you so much!
they confused all the people hate watching as people liking it.
ur looking beautiful melonie hope u have an awesome day
what s with the scrappy doo hate  that s my boy. he was ready to box the undead for his uncle scooby. scrappy was legit. i won t stand for this disrespect.
too many people hate watched velma  and they mistook that for ratings.
which episode of ren and stimpy  btw  look into the creator  jon k  see if he s still in the news.
when i think of hbo max i think of adult television if not erotic adult television  not kid-friendly entertainment.
there is a series on you tube that your nephew can watch melonie.  it is called super book.  it is about a talking bible that can transport two children a boy and girl to different time periods during bible times and they meet people like adam and eve  noah  moses  and even jesus.  there is even a reboot of the series and both of them the are the real family friendly instead of the woke definitiion.
scrappy was never bad as a character  just designed to be a little annoying pup and we love him
auntie melonie. by the congratulations on that. i m about to be uncle  again  myself.
hbo max ruined scooby doo with velma  by focusing on the woke-ism  bad casting  obviously not scooby doo fans among the voice actors   instead of the mystery team taking down monsters.  without the monsters  scooby doo is meaningless  and not a situation comedy.  hbo max can start another scooby doo show  and make it a maximum attack on monsters  as a movie channel  give us a hoard of demons  where something wicked this way comes   this is when you can regain an audience.  who cares about friendship   they are already friends and a team  find the monsters.
more like scooby doo fans have been eating scooby doo doo.
look at who owns velma. then look who owns them  and who owns them. at the top are large investment firms  the biggest corporation in the planet s history. two of which are worth a combined total of  18 trillion. esg is how these companies get investment money these days and this show pushes all of their messages. it could get zero views and they would probably still run it.
nice tanktop melonie
too many scooby dooand not enoughyabadabado
my thoughts exactly . pull out the vhs.
these producers man  lemme at them  lemme at them
what s the glowing thing on the floor behind you   please say it s a tron identity disc.
boomer mel.. it welcome to the club.
the fact that they made a disgusting  scooby doo  for adults and then instantly made one for preschoolers makes me slightly uncomfortable
well  season two of  velma  was cancelled on before 18jan2023.  so there is that....
you almost made it 10 seconds before making a pun this time.
if was the one where ren poured gasoline over a fire  and i remember a bee stinging someone s tongue and flying away while its stinger and guts  tissue stayed. not even that bad but grandma wasn t having it lol!
@melonie mac go boom  good times
@melonie mac go boom  i remember seeing that episode once on snick and never again  i think they pulled it.
@melonie mac go boom  ren and stimpy was freakin amazing.
great video melonie mac go boom skipping scooby-doo projects scap
love the shirt!
powder toast man .....
great video melanie i m so tired of hbo favoring that stupid velma show over other better scooby doo projects
melanie velma can t get scrapped because it s not a scooby doo project it s the fattest thing from it
...re-runs...everything s in the archives...
in the words of a wise man  everything woke turns to shit.
i wound up with mr. peabody   sherman instead - as you might have guessed.
i can imagine william hanna and joseph barbara rolling around in their graves
will scooby show in it
@melonie mac go boom isn t that why the velma va got a medial from the white house recently   destroying a franchise in one weems time is wreckord
so they get rid of the good scooby-doo! project  then promote the bad one  oy.
im probably gonna get skewered for this  but  here goes  i never liked scooby doo
i do have a preschooler and anything made after 2010 is highly sus.
your hair looks nice on your video.
a war of attrition on the minds of the masses
melon  tell your gramma to stop being out here snitching
this is peak insanity
im guessing they were able to make another season because the viewership ratings was so high because every youtuber watched it to get hits all people including youtubers should boycott the series and that is where it hits them hard  not just people complaining about it. i am in agreement  this sort of show should not exist  rather hire skilled writers and animators to create worthy shows.
kids today don t watch modern cartoons. i have young children myself and nephews and they all watch youtubers and so do all their friends. put thundercats or old he- man on and they are obsessed. kids just want entertainment and heroic adventures not pandering.
commenting to feed the algorithm
wb are officially idiots. like  paw patrol is pretty popular and i m sure that merch sells a lot. so a scooby-doo version of something similar would have likely done the same. but hey  guess wb don t like making money.
hi melonie will you see john wick 4
all those people hate watching it.
meloine. have you seen what they did to the best show of all time  to me anyway. rugrats! they ruined such a phenomenal show.
a pup named scooby doo 2
i just don t freaking understand why these studios keep hiring this terrible writers ! like stop it already and just hire writers that aren t going to ruin more beloved childhood series. but unfortunately if they get views  they will make more.
i m okay with velma being sexual.but only with linda cardinelli.
what s a vhs
they admited velma is a disaster!
di di did it go boom!
why isn t what they ve done to scooby-doo considered cultural appropriation
mystery pups  coughpawpatrolcough
am i correct that mindy k just received some national award from the president
this all started when women began getting tattoos.
obviously  the show was too hetero. hey honey  the kids are watching a cartoon i found and i thought they would enjoy.  it s called  fritz the cat .
eating like vegans.  shot fired by the carnivore.  lol!
tbh in my opinion they ruined scooby doo by making the velma series they just f d all up by the changing the characters and their personalities  ect.
never mind
this is why scrappy doo should have been in a g     movie part 2 i don t care what anyone has to say part 2 is good for what it was even though alicia silverstone was slight villain but not really. i m just glad velma is canceled no more talking nonsense congratulations of winning a metal for nothing.
mindy kaling got a medal from the president
what happened to the bible verses  did i miss something
the preschool one probably would have non-binary gay characters.
mindy kaling screwed up everything!!!!
thank god velma is finally over
i wish that velma was cancelled
...says the super attractive lady.
i wish they would stop ruining great series and make something original for once.
i m sick of tired of this crap.
when that women mindy kaling appeared on it s always sunny in philadelphia i was so disappointed.  i am glad she was only on one episode.  she isn t funny  never was.
no trans puppies can t have that
mcu she hulk and 2022 batman are far worst.
i hate velma it sucks!
the show velma was so terrible and it was racist
just watch anime  western shit sucks  it has for a long time  people make fun of anime and call it cringe  but velma is like a perfect example  it s like a carl jung archetype of usian western cringe. just watch anime instead.
first comment!
i m an uncle to a very advanced 2 year old niece  and dude  you can t even trust sesame street these days...recommendations  old 90 s dc marvel toons  and avatar the last airbender.
velma is a tasteless adult swim parody.
that s an insult to adult swim.
