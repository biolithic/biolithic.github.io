just makes want to play the game even more and support the people that will stream it.
imagine getting  canceled  for playing a video game. truly  these are mentally unhinged times.
are we just going to ignore the fact that the cat stopped dead in it s tracks when mel reeeeeeee d
absolutely love seeing the cancel mob take ls  especially after they put in so much money and work
melonie jk rowling is the hero we don t deserve but the hero we need
i m not even a harry potter fan.  but i will make sure i buy this game to a. have a good gaming experience   b. support jk rowling and c. to make the demons even more mad
jk disagrees with them on a single thing and suddenly she s evil. i disagree with her on plenty of stuff  i have preordered and can t wait to be the best dark gryffindor i can be. excited to watch your chaotic hufflepuff streams!
hopefully this will help more companies realize that people screaming on sites like twitter aren t the majority of consumers.
victory is ours! still can t wait to play this game! also you look good today melonie! can t wait see you play mario cart against geeks and gamers!
that website is an awesome idea.  thanks to whomever put the time and effort into making it.  i m going there right now to find out who s streaming this game so i can watch them play it.
as a fan of hp since i got the first book at around six years old  i am so freaking excited for this game and am looking forward to exploring the castle as a ravenclaw.
game looks good i just rewatched all the harry potter movies just so i can enjoy this game more
snitching on people for playing a video game  lol. they have a panic attack every time they don t get their way. love the great news seeing the game winning now  even better coming from you. great video melonie  you re doing a brilliant job keeping us informed. been a rough day as well  here s for making it better.
you re one of my go to channels right now. you ve even inspired me to read the bible  good job!
major win for the developers  voice actors  motion capture artists  and everyone else behind the game for their amazing hard work. can t wait to play tf out of the game tonight while the woke mob continues to cry
picking up my pre-order tomorrow after the gym. everything i hear online just keeps making me more excited for the game. thanks for the another great video melonie. you look gorgeous today btw! blue is a great color for you.
i think it s funny that even the main stream outlets who said that they didn t want to play it  or that they were going to give a bad reviews  are already giving it high marks  despite the fact that they pander to the woke crowd! we know what s gonna happen now  they re all going to apologize and get eaten alive by the people who claim to be the peaceful  loving crowd.
always love how the people who push accepting everyone and being inclusive only applies unless you re different from them
just want to bring up that  girlfriend reviews  who is a wholesome review couple  started streaming hogwart s legacy and the girlfriend got bullied so bad on stream by haters  that she left crying. so if you can  send them some love and support. so much for inclusivity
you re absolutely right  it s a clown world. the world is starting to look like the hunger games.
stop   promoting hate
@smurfie8412  stop being a npc.
you re easily manipulated by marketing campaigns then.
so...this game isn t woke at all
i don t even game  and i ll buy it and give it away lol.
@zackfair6791  you can make your character trans  but apparently  other than that  no.
@zackfair6791  you are either a wizard or a witch with various body type choices. you be the judge if it s woke enough for you. feels like just reality to me.
@smurfie8412  boooga! boooga!
these people are cancelling rowling for simply acknowledging that sex exists and the word woman s primary usage is to describe adult human females.  the purity spiral is out of control.
these busybody nobodies have always been doing this  they noisier now because of the internet.
@behind2032  yeah  you can t mention who  last time i had a reply with example mention  that comment got hidden after few hours later.
heck  melonie got  cancelled  for her choice on the vaccine. ridiculous.
@dustinmartin2369  they should all transplant male organ as well  if they do i could say they are serious about it. but until then they are just colorful clowns making fun of themselves.
in the 90 s mortal kombat was boycotted by christians and concerned parents that found it too violent. they had a senate council hearing over the matter  which resulted in the ersb standard to label the maturity rating of games. on some level  among all media  some of the best art  music  movies  even games have been made when there was some level of standards. today  we have no standards  save for maybe the worst standards of the woke mob  who apparently want everything to be about  child loving  trans of any color and race but white doing things we can t mention on here without being banned  unless you happen to be of the woke mob and all for inclusion of their mental illness in everything.
imagine not realizing you ve been tricked into playing a sexually ambiguous character while talking to trans bartenders. wow
cat   h-has she learned my language !
i m glad i m not the only one who noticed that. i thought for a moment it was going to slow walk backwards out of the room.
your not wrong dude
@megamanxfan21xx
melonie has that effect.  d
ha  good one  brother!
@truthoverlies6434  no  i was easily manipulated i would be woke by now.
any that harasses you for playing this game is an enemy of the living. the want to control what you do in your own privacy! you know what you must do. you have the right and the duty to act. they are no criminals that fight for a freer future  only heroes.
@dustinmartin2369  they also tricked you into playing the most woke game that has likely ever existed
@john dodo  - that s virtually every indie furry game. though no tricks attached. you have some idea where things might go with furries.
@johndodo2062  - imagine being tricked into hating a woke trans game due to hatred of the author game developers you claim to be anti-trans.
@kayaphus  - as a christisn that got the whole  you re a bigot if you don t read the books!  i standing this one out. just here with the popcorn  watching the usual leftist hypocritical insanity unfold.
sweeeet  sweeeet victoryyyy
they tried so hard to sabotage this game and failed
stop   supporting hate
@smurfie8412  you d have to leave the world entirely to stop supporting imperfect people. and then you d still be stuck with yourself. everything you could possibly enjoy and everyone you could possibly support has some connection to something morally questionable. you simply cannot boycott consistently.
@smurfie8412  sfup
@smurfie8412  truth hurts! jkr sed nothing wrong!
@jameshurley776 how is someone who helped bring all this on a  hero  of those who dislike it  imagine someone driving a bus full of children at top speed as fast as they could  then when they find out they can t get it to stop before it crashes  they think  well this isn t good  then leap out of the door and land safely on the side of the road  leaving the bus to crash  then suddenly everyone is calling the driver  a hero .... like.... no  the driver was the one who caused the bus to get to the point when a crash was inevitable in the first place
now wait a minute.....she turned dumbledore gay for no reason
nah he was gay to begin with  it s there we saw it  same with the child  also was there back in book 5 aaaand she was always a radical feminist- the girls dormitory is inaccessible for boys since book 1 or 3 way back when.
@smurfie8412  reeeeeeeee!!!
exorcising demons just by enjoying a game. easiest way to do the lord s work.
the game isn t about harry potter  just the wizard universe he lives in. i m not a harry potter fan either  but i don t like bullies like the woke left. so i pre-ordered hogwarts legacy  digital deluxe edition  and i have never pre-ordered a game on steam before. i was rewarded when it became the  1 selling game on steam. take that you woke bullies.edit  to all wokies  jk rowling is not the reason i bought the game  you are.
i heard it was a looter shooter. that alone piqued my interest.
same here
i bought two copies of the deluxe. one for myself one for a friend.
the problem is that many of these companies aren t catering to a loud minority because they mistake them for a majority  it s that their ideologies are in alignment with each other.
woohoo!!! thank you so much!  d
vroom vroom
@cauearaujo4105  tool bag
victoreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
@opusss  stay salty hahah. man this is good.
i m excited for your demographic. even if this game is mediocre  looking great so far though   it s still going to be amazing for you original fans.
@user-tm8jt2py3d  yeah  i think that s who it ll definitely appeal to the most especially with all the easter eggs nods to the books and such.
ravenclaw squad!!!
i did the exact same thing man. 21 hours to go!
i watched first movie earlier before i  played and the vault trip was in the game lol i am shook wasent expecting that but i got the other 7 movies to watch also
they will product a female predator like mindy kaling or lena dunham  but god forbid you play hogwarts legacy.
@gokux75  i know lol  we can t have our one to their hundred thousand apparently.
oh yay that makes me so happy! god bless!
jesus loves you
good for you. you ll learn much more life lessons from the bible  then you ever could from the internet and social media.
they are not only crying but also throwing there toys out of there pram
so happy the game is reviewing and selling well  despite the fake boycotts from karens online.can t wait to play it myself tonight.
i ve only seen the movies but the game looks great  makes it that much sweeter that the boycott failed miserably.  expellus wokus!
well i ve never played anything with harry potter but i m actually quite interested in getting the game. it sounds like it s going to be a great game to play.
i don t plan on playing this game at all  not because i m one of those dumb wokies  because i ve never been a harry potter person  but i m glad that people are playing hogwarts legacy and enjoying it! you keep crushing those woke cultists  gamer brothers and sisters!
to be honest  the increase of bullying tactics that were taken has personally encouraged me to dust off my twitch account and stream it
seeing this just made my day. thank you for showing me this melonie.
i haven t been this pumped for a game since elden ring...love the idea in general and have always wanted this game from this universe
when people stand up to the woke bullies those bullies get intimidated and run away. they retreat to their blog  twitter  always twitter   or where ever and whine about being a  victim.  it s kind of like the kid that goes up to another kid  punches him  the other kid hits back  and the kid who threw the first punch starts screaming  did you see that  he him me!
can t wait for tuesday! or friday if you get the standard version. happy spellcasting folks!
mel going full bellatrix will never not be funny
played the game. absolutely amazing. as a harry potter fan  this is the game we both need and deserve. it is so refreshing to see that somebody finally did an adaptation that not only cares about the fans but also respects the source materials. the story sets 100 years before harry potter  yet still makes you feel it is that same hogwarts. such an awesome game.
i am so happy that it s actually good. my biggest fear was that it would be all hype and no show like cyberpunk
been playing hwl for 4 hours it s amazing definitely worth every penny!
this just proves ones again that people who shout the loudest are most likely the minority. money speaks louder than tweets  and real gamers are screaming back with their wallets supporting this awesome game and supporting creativity! i m in the uk so i still need to wait a few more hours for the pre-order release but it s already preloading as we speak i can t wait to play this game!
im not a huge fan of harry potter other than the first book we read in school  and the first film that came out a few years after reading the book. but the world of wizards as an rpg has been a long time calling that i need to play this game lol melonie has been my my life long crush since as long as i can remember! i cant wait to tune in for this stream tomorrow!
i preordered the deluxe edition the second it dropped  i never let politics into the free space of gaming! i grew up playing video games and i ll never let anyone dictate my choice and values.
lol!  i love your presentation and attitude melonie  and extra so when you re extra.  you re awesome.  3  thank god for you.
just watched acg s review of it  and it honestly looks really good. i say this as someone that never really cared about hp stuff.
thanks to all of you that bought and supported a game with trans inclusivity. as they say  speak with your wallets  and you all proved that it was the right decision. hopefully this leads to a lot more games releasing with inclusivity in mind too.
j.k. rowling is not an  elephant in the room . she is a classically educated genius who has surmounted more adversity  contributed more to society  and donated more to charity than any online activist will ever do  all whilst retaining her charm and humour. riddikulus.     r.g.
i m over 9 hours in and it s amazing! i couldn t give it a bad review even if i wanted to and i think that s what happened with most of the gaming outlets.
the ign one was hilarious cause he did an interview after saying everyone else was to scared to do the review
happy monday melonie mac! looking forward to seeing you  lady rippa  rippa  dan vasc and geeks   gamers on mario kart tonight
never saw a single potter movie or read any of the books prior to this year. i saw the game reveal last year  and i thought it looked pretty intriguing even though i wasn t a fan of the ip. once the wokescold grievance machine began to mobilize against it  i began to take more notice and interest  so i watched a few more previews  and i was sold enough to pre-order. i watched the first 5 movies in the past couple of weeks to prepare  and i loaded the game up for the first time this morning - man  it s a beautiful bit of escapism that i can tell i ll be getting a good 80-100  hours out of.
the game is amazing. as a harry potter fan  i love every aspect of it.
just found your channel recently and after hearing you speak truth  i m hooked. well done  will be a loyal viewer from hear on out
my copy from best buy is arriving soon.  there are some channels posting gameplay already and it s looking very  very good.  already made sure i ve got enough space on the ssd.i hope devs are taking note of what is going on and finally begin to understand that they don t need to kowtow to these people any more.  they never did.
hopefully this means basedness will become the new marketing approach for game companies
you love to see it! with all this salt i m going to make a margarita  sit down and enjoy this game to the fullest
i like seeing melonie happy
i got the game this saturday it s an actual masterpiece  there are no bugs or performance issues and it doesn t even have the patch yet this really is a 10 10 game
thank you cult for helping me to find streams of this game faster so i can see how great it is. also don t worry mob i totally got  dunk on the woke  money to spare its how i got a few other great games they shined a spotlight in failed cancellations.
you re such a nerd melonie  i love it. this game is going to be great i m so excited to play tomorrow.
teacher says every time the woke mob complains about hogwarts legacy it sells another dozen copies
you are such a refreshing sharp spear in this culture war melonie. you stab it right  as it a good fight to be had! good truths here. and this game sounds awesome!
i can t wait to play the game. aztecross was streaming for 16 hours yesterday and the game looked fantastic.
this whole thing made me want to pre-order the deluxe edition  which is the first time i ve ever pre-ordered a deluxe edition of any game.
hail melonie  i cant wait til your hogwarts legacy streams!
in 22 and a half hours i ll be playing with the 72 hours early access for pc!  its gonna be fun!
i bought the game s deluxe edition  i ve been playing it for a few hours now and honestly   good  is understatement of the year  i m fanboying as hard as with jedi fallen order  and i m a star wars fanatic while of hp i ve only read the books and seen a couple of movies. it s actually making me want to look into the hp extended universe.maybe it drops the ball later on  sure  but whoever said it s  mid  is nuts  hardcore sour grapes because they know they ll never be able to admit they also pre-ordered it and are fanboying a hundred times harder.ah well  yet another contradiction to add to their growing list like complaining of white people voicing black characters a couple days back right after defending a black guy playing a white character in the mcu a couple days before that.
so excited to play it tonight!
i am playing it right now and loving it! it s gorgeous on the ps5 and worth the wait. it looks like i m getting a broom soon so guess what i m gonna do! victory to the people!
can t wait for this to be goty 2023 nominated...
i m a real potterhead  but i don t play these sort of games. that said... i too am sooo glad about this win over the stupid but dangerous woke mob! see! it can be done if enough normal people stand up to them! well done everybody who supported this game in any way!   3
i don t care about harry potter. but i m happy for the fans that they got a good game. have fun playing  everyone!
i m so happy for this video game to be out in stores tomorrow   i have been seeing and reading so much of good comments about this video game too. anyway also you look beautiful and lovely today melonie. also this is another great video that you have done for today. anyway keep it up melonie. anyway hope you have had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also i may stop by on twitch to say hello  to you and everyone else before i go to bed  ok melonie. anyway have a great evening   good nite.
i too have been waiting a long time for a hp rpg like this. at first glance  it reminds me of valhalla - which is a really fun  addictive game. plus  after we lost the niantic hp app  i am jonesing for some good hp stuff again.
i m so happy this game turned out well. honestly the woke mob did me a favor on this one  because i wasn t paying attention to this game at all until they brought it up  and it s incredible.
now that is an awesomely great video game review
i was so excited to see your video after the metacritic dropped! gamers win!
can t wait for you to stream it on your other channel to celebrate! woooooo
i was going to wait for a sale with this one  but i dropped   on a deluxe edition pre-order  knowing it infuriates the blue-hairs.
i wouldn t be surprised if hogwarts legacy is one of the top streamed games for a few weeks. also apparently alot of people moved to new zealand. if you know you know
i was never the biggest harry potter fan  but i ll probably get this game at some point. looks like fun and if it isn t full of woke junk like every other game released in the last few years it s worth getting for that alone.
0 07 that was my morning when i  suggested  that  wookiepedia was in league with lucasfilm and disney incorporated. also  resetera needs to get with a slander lawsuit. that s how this shit always ends. go after the money.
the whole controversy for this game just became a selling point  its hilarious
when we said  defund the police  we never meant pull all their funding!  what riots   it s just property.
a lot of people who  don t share her views are just cowards some actually don t but a lot of people are afraid of the backlash there is more of you stop being scared by these bullies.you actually have the numerical power.you are just trying to be fair and some from that community  and i stress some because others also think they go  take advantage of you trying to be fair and become bullies
just watched ryan kinel play the intro  looks pretty good  story sounds interesting
i bought it and have been playing all it day! it s really amazing
of course it s good  it has great writing behind it!!!
haters will always find reasons to hate  they choose to be ignorant and made themselves into jokes. while they re hating  i m laughing at jokes they turned themselves into. now that s entertainment.
in one of your recent videos you said the woke community weren t your friends or something like that but that was so freaking true like i d say that was super accurate and i love your videos
this was definitely interesting to say the least
me  gonna see what melonie has to say today!melonie  peer pressure  guilt tripping  shaming  name calling...me   melonie coming in hot!  this ones gonna be a good one.sees cole train walking inme  cole train!  attention distracted entire video
if someone wants to unfriend me for playing a game  or for telling me not to play  i would tell them to pound salt or ignore them altogether  as far as the game is concerned . i don t know why advocating women not being safe in certain areas is a hill they want to die on. as always  you look beautiful. god bless.
glad to see it s a great game.
congrats devs and congrats everyone with a brain
looking forward to this game. watching the woke meltdown is going to make it that much more enjoyable
i wouldn t call jk rowling woke  she s definitely left  but i never hear her attacking people or forcing them to believe her and her alone. i also don t keep up with celebrities anymore  so i may be wrong.
hahaha. watching them seethe gives me more satisfaction than i can ever replicate naturally xd.
travis is a very good and fair judge of games from what i have seen of his reviews. he is also part of the destiny 2 world.
the only thing i d do  if i were a twitch streamer  is make note of the fact this exists and if you end up getting attacked by the insanity from these people that leads to anything substantial you ll have something for legal repercussions.
i m debating on whether i should get it or just watch someone play it. harry potter is like my preferred seires  because it scratches the genre itch  i love fantasy of all kinds.
great video! can t wait to play tomorrow!
i used to be a developer and the fact that the people want to cancel the team that made this game is disturbing.
yo  jk rowling basically said  the sky is blue . these haters live in crazy town.
a w for us folks that don t give a shit and just love a good game
the game deserves an 85  there are some perfomemence issues here and there so it is much deserved imo
you get more savage every week and i love it. go collect those scalps
i saw that tweet with the  destiny rip  thing. it was just a pic of the character screen ui which like 99.9  of games us. it the typical screen you see when you change your look and weapons with your character being in the middle of the screen
i don t ever pre-order games because you ll likely get effed. but i pre-ordered the  70 edition of hogwarts just to do my part.
i can t wait to play hogwarts legacy friday
cant wait to watch u play on twitch!!! go big d!!
i can t wait to play this game as a huge harry potter fan it s everything i ve hoped for and more  it s even pushed me to buy a ps5 so i can play it as early as possible  i personally will be representing my hufflepuff pride  when i play it myself  so yeah screw the woke mob i m going to enjoy every second of my experience with this game  keep up the great work melonie you ve definitely earned my subscription from this video and your cover of the game has been awesome .
hope yall enjoy it. i m still simping on legend of zelda tears of the kingdom and hollow knight silksong  those are my 2 big games this year.
i m looking forward to streaming this tomorrow!
can t wait to play this. twitter isn t the real world and this proves it. companies need to stop listening to them and make stuff ppl want.
i just found your channel now as i was flipping through hogwarts legacy videos. i m a gamer and i can t stand  woke culture . i m subbed melonie  you re awesome!!
i m really enjoying this game  there is some glitching but it could be looked pass lol but just have to wait until they do some patching. but other than that i m having a really good time with the game.
the haters lost lol nothing or no one is going to stop me from playing this game  nice work mel
i think we started to trick the woke crowd in to fighting each other at this point.
not a harry potter fan myself and won t be buying the game but i am happy for all the fans who have a game that s respects the source material and looks like a great game.
normal people  jk rowling is a bit woke but i still love the books and the world that she created.the woke  she is not as woke as us so cancel her immediately!
this game is what we needed to show the wokies that not everything has to be woke to be good.
i m thoroughly enjoying the game and streaming it to boot lol
no worries mel  it s ok to be extra
haven t played it yet but a lot of reviews said it was awesome
the ign reviewer is also mvp for doing what others won t within ign
great to hear   still annoyed the devs bend the knee  but oh welll glad that its a success
they almost all eat each other alive anyways. it s an impossible battle being the most miserable. a race to the bottom.
@residentevilclone  pretty much
i feel like anyone who uses that tool to find streamers covering this game is going to use it  unfollow the streamer and then in their minds just bask in the the total and complete delusion that them unfollowing a streamer will singly handedly destroy the streamer. that s just how self important and demented so many of those boycotters are  it s so sad.
thanks for drawing attention to these idiots and how they got stomped on by the sales and success.  also  mad respect for rowling.
melony you make me smile.  backwards clownworld   which is biblical btw  - 2 timothy describes a situation near the end where there will be haters of those that are good. calling evil good and good evil...  can t help but chuckle at some of your jokes. love it. never change. keep it up.
cant wait to play this tomorrow!
game deserved a 90
this is a absolute w
0 06 cat tried to come in and got reee d at
it s really good game i thought.melonie may u havea blessed wonderful weektakecare melonie
she got reality checked n royalty checked at the same time
hey melonie. hope you re well. looking forward to g g mario kart tonight.
the rant at 8 52 should be required viewing for every executive in western entertainment
i m not a huge harry potter fan. but i am a huge fan of open world rpg s  another good rpg can only be a good thing.
your cat agrees. was looking at you and was like  yep!   and then left your room.
i haven t seen melonie mac in a decade or more. had no idea she s so based.
now we know just how the salem witch trials could happen.
this makes me happy  but super pleased it sounds good on top
so far  1 on epic and steam baby!! even with the  problems
they re acting surprised that nobody is listening to them anymore because they re too stubborn and prideful to admit they re wrong. that s what i think it comes down to  here. we know what goes before a fall  too.
can t wait to play this gamee!
already 220k people watching hogwarts on twitch at 1 00 p.m finnish time. i d call that a fatality.
that ign review is wild.  the main story bored me  the enemy variety wasn t there  and there were consistent technical issues including pop-in  aggressive loading times  and lighting issues... that s a 9 out of 10 for me.   harry potter nostalgia detected
i plan on watching any stream that does hogwarts.
keep up the good work lady.
you re not woking right people  - the last few years summed up in as many words lol
the swedish gaming outlet gamereactor gave this an 8 10  which mostly had to do with some clunky menus and a few bugs the reviewer encountered. they did not  unlike ign  address the  elephant in the room . the review didn t have a single mention of this whole situation  it just talked about the game and how it was  and that s it. infact the only mention of it they ve ever made was a brief article where they simply mentioned that some people were upset about the game. respect  gamereactor  i always thought you were much better than your american counterparts.
the game is amazing!!!
your cat really didn t like walking into that  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
it is now currently downloading data on my ps5  so i ll be playing in about an hour s time. till then  i m gonna try and finally get a shiny froakie in pokemon violet. update  nevermind  i forgot how terrible game data downloads are on ps5. what started as a 1 hour download became 12 hours after putting it in rest mode. had to delete it and start again. made it about 3 4 to the  ready to play  milestone before it basically stalled  downloading at a measley 5.5mb per second... for an 80gb game. download time is currently at 2 hours 30 minutes and rising...
yeahus!!! hogwarts legacy goty
it s so good even ign gave it a 9 it s so good as hard as they tried it s too good to try to review bomb fans win again
i m a huge fan of hp. i ve been desperately waiting for the game since ever the first leak in 2018. i m very happy to see the game is truly great and the dev made such a beautiful game. however i don t believe in the game journalists or the score the game got. l word to people who tried to cancel it.
lol you re cat was stopped in it s tracks when it heard you  reeeee!
cancel culture failed !  we are the champions  my friends  okay now time for me to be a fifth year wizard from ravenclaw
i have my copy preloaded and can t wait to play it tomorrow.
thanks for being amazing and defending my favorite game
earned a sub from me. speak up when others are cowards.
all this campaign did was isolate the extreme parts of that group from the general public. they wanted so badly to have enemies that they didn t know what to do when they actually made some.
i agree with you nick unforately i can t download it til after 130 central  time but i be playing it that evening.  and look forward to you streaming it mel
hogwarts wins  flawless victory  fatality!
excited to learn how to stream to twitch so i can be on a cool list
yep the woke cultist should learn a lesson from this provided that they are even capable of learning from their mistakes and that is never mess with the gamer community and culture especially when it comes to any new game that we are looking forward to play and any favourite games as well
@werty21100  or a franchise as big as this nei one will care except the twitter but don t tell a gamer to not guy a game they ll guy just out of spite if they weren t gonna buy it already they ll but it not just put of pure and utter spite
i hope the streamers  not only stream it but also  put it out  to rerun for months   .
i think it s pathetic how they still denounce jk.
i really hope that bible breath podcast happens
lol i m gonna beat the game   play it all over again now!  d
i bought this game because of those people. never watched the movie and i must say .. this not bad  kinda made me regret not reading the books and watching the movie as a kid
found you on twitter through a mutual  liked the characters name. came to the channel to find this vid starts off with a reeeeee    and an  own the libs   aw hell yeah 100  subbed.also id like to collab at some point if your down  ive been trying to get into content creation for ages but need a bit of a group to grow and bounce ideas back and forth with as well. let me know as im trying to get better at streaming and need some based people to play with. yeah i know i m still pretty small potatoes right now but what can you do    hold on  and a clown world    approved narrative   ok 100  a supporter now!
this game is full of diversitiy and troons but you really owned the wokes by buying it.
first off  i love your videos and follow you.  keep up the good work  however  did anyone consider these woke accounts on twitter may now be used to bump sales numbers with fake rage   4d marketing...  anyways hope the game is good.
i cannot wait to make a my immortal run.
cat  minding own businessmel   reeeeeeee!!!!!!! cat  stops dead in alarmmel    the woke cult has failed!!! cat   oh just the woke cult again  carries on
they should just give a list of streamers who have streamed that wizard game so i can just sub them.
unleash the fury of the purple-hairs
see you all in december for another glorious round when the game is nominated mutiple times and outlets and journos alike try to tiptoe around the fact that  yes  they have no leg to stand on when trying to criticize the game  d
keep up the good work
this is probably the best video i ve seen all month so far.
so so excited for this game! i m a hufflepuff
3 55 it went down to 82 i think they are trying to review bomb but we have to wait for this friday to see if it goes up or down dramatically
i want a backwards version of that website so i can follow everybody that stream that game.
there use to be trending on youtube videos of  the moment just before the pain .  they must be reliving it.
i m not a harry potter fan  but i might buy the game and have it sit in my steam library to support the devs that have to endure this and i get to own the woke as a bonus.
eww hufflepuff  d can t wait for this game too.
@briangrant9942  lol what house are you
@leveluplucy  oo you re not gonna like it slytherin  d but my patronus is a ocicat i guess looks like a fox and a cat maybe being a slytherin balance it out.
@briangrant9942  haha i figured that was your house. slytherins not bad. a lot of my friends are apparently align with that house  i do have to say that i love the slytherin hogwarts legacy entrance. i kind of want to play a good wizard on my first play through but my second play through i ll be a dark wizard in slytherin   d
@leveluplucy  lol yeah the entrance is nice i was wishing for being in the house of ravenclaw i just love the look in that house but slytherin has a very nice design too and i like the wand it gave me.
@briangrant9942  i thought the sorting hat would give me ravenclaw but it stuck me in hufflepuff  it s ok though. i put honestly and loyalty above everything else
@leveluplucy  ohh you went that route  d i guess when i picked that i like darkness but fear fire or what item you pick up from a chest a golden key or a black glove i went with the glove and gave me the green team  d
they can try to justify  lessen whatever they want  but we do not forget. in an era of crappy games being the norm  hogwarts legacy has great graphics  judging by the trailers   the gameplay appears solid  and the overall freedom to do what you want in-game is promising. i bought it for the above reasons. giving the woke left a middle finger is just a bonus.
this is where we steal the cancellation mob s tool and use that app to find those that we want to follow.
this is definitely good to see.
wooooooooooooooo woke fails!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! stay mad haters!!!! my copy has been processed  payment out my bank. i have seen a no spoiler review and the game looks absolutely phenomenal! i am joining the snakes and learning the dark arts with no consequences. bye haters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am so happy the scores are coming in high for hogwarts legacy and many reviews on yt are glowing. the game honestly looks so much fun and the dev team have been forthcoming about what they have showed and wow.....it isn t a broken mess or ruined with woke points on release. two of my favourite gaming franchises have become woke messes...both from bioware....who have went so woke themselves i have no hope for future games so i am always on the lookout for new good games now!
the new wizard game is good. never read the books  nor seen the movies  but wizard game is good. whips magic stick
i laugh knowing many of the haters have already pre-ordered this game and are going to play it because they grew up with this  universe   then i realize they are going to go invisible on steam  turn off discord  and hide as hard as they can from their fellow bigots...er friends  and i laugh even harder.
great video as always
these people are the worst. they say people are hurting them by buying this game. and they don t even bat an eyelid to hurt others. they bullied girlfriends reviews for playing this game. they are one of the most wholesome youtuber.
can you please host the next g4!
this seems useful to know who to watch on twitch
this site is crazy  the wokies. you look great melonie. hufflepuff chaotic for the win
before you declare victory  is there any chance that all of this could be a double reverse  also  are you for real
i hope that hogleg is a decent game. i see it as a solid 1 time playthrough much like the shadow of mordor games.to me the story wont be anything interesting just your usually hero go save the world. open world with linear story  skills have specific place to use them  collect or don t  loz  . i was hoping to be able to mix it up with some spell craft  create charms  hex  curse  counters  enchants. you have classmates and all of them will be npc quest giver personalities. most interaction will be  talk   x   npc dialogue   x  accept   o  not right now.i hope i am wrong. please let me be wrong.
these brownie points must be that important for them to willingly bankrupt themselves because these decisions are not great financially.
rowling is such a strange phenomena. she went from saying stuff like  of course  dumbledore is gay   or  of course  hermione is black  to becoming one of the biggest targets for cancel culture in recent years also  why the hell are they trying to cancel the game. it s not like its success is gonna affect rowling all that much. wb games has already payed her for the rights.
treated myself to the deluxe edition and currently waiting till midnight only two hours to go. those woke 12 people are just cringe and over sensitive and will never influence my decision on anything
minerva mcgonagall decided to add her take in the first 10 seconds
i ve been playing for like..maybe 6 or 7 hours and holy shit is it fun. im so happy that the game is actually genuinely fantastic  cause..as fun as it was to own the nutcases..it mattered 100  more at the end of the day that it d be a good game instead of just one to piss people off
question  how long before they ve canceled so many people that...they don t have enough people to influence anything anymore  i m not a math wiz  but losing from one side to give to the other tends to give them more strength
i m surprised twitch didn t bend the knee and ban people from playing it on stream.
yeah the way they turn on people for saying the smallest things is so insane  a losing strategy
did people really hate buy this game  i feel like people just bought it cuz they wanted it lol. buying out of spite is pretty equal to boycotting. and encouraging people to buy to  own the libs  is equal to encouraging people to boycott. the only people who aren t stupid are the people who avoided the conversation. i thought this was gonna be a review lol! that said  i like your content! new sub
even if the accusation of buying this game to own libs were true for some  it s ironic that they even mention this having spent  1000 on harry potter books for a mere removal of jk rowling s name.
the reviewers that are giving games that don t fit their politics bad scores don t realize or care that dev bonuses are often based on metacritic scores and by letting their politics guide the review  they are hurting the little guys they claim to want to protect.
i m actually disappointed i cannot get this game  no way to play it anymore   and i have never read the books or fully watched the movies. i was gonna get it on day 1  oh well  maybe next year.
a hogwarts legacy update  complete with a hogwarts legacy ad before the video.  nice.
that website tool can also be used to find streamers to watch. so it is a 2 edged tool.
i cannot wait for the release at gamestop or amazonwhat tickles your fancy
haha  the beginning of this video made my day. mwahahahaha
ign gave it a 9!
damn that reeee caught me off guard.
i m going to be honest  i wasn t sure if avalanche was going to be able to pull it off  considering how they managed to find a way to make mad max dull  but this is a positive surprise. insert pathetically thirsty and vaguely creepy comment about melonie here  as seems to be customary
i miss when gaming and just everything in general was having fun. i dont understand how this sub 1  group of ppl has made this much noise crying and yelling and major companies have actually listened. everyone has to take a side now  games were one of the last truly  free  places.
1. u gained a follower  2. i followed u on ig to 3. i m not a potter fan and i m gonna buy this game lol 4. this video is awesome 5. the woke can suck it lol
it kinda saddens me that at some point we went from making quality games that was great in some areas  maybe not all but good nonetheless to their strengths. and now they re trying to fill some quota to satisfy people who are not even fans of games  while shitting on the current fans
your cat s reaction on the reeee! though...
flawless victory mortal combat  lol the game is amazing btw     it should always be based on its own merit   not some things people say about things
i don t like harry potter  but i wish everyone who plays hogwarts legacy to have fun!
love your channel just subbed !
thing is  the wokemob are not woke in any way or shape.... they re literally a bunch of bullies. i know  because my dodgy cousin is one. i had been informed recently about when my brother lived with our uncle  and hence cousins  when he was a kid and put into the  child care  system that said dodgy cousin literally picked on my brother for a reaction knowing full well her father would side with her  even most of the times when it was obvious it was her causing the problems.currently  my dodgy cousin is using  being trans-nonbinary  as a weapon to bully people with  has a phd for biochemistry but is now essentially been moved  by those who run the institutions  into the social-science of repeating the same  experiment  over and over that had been done already many times over 3 decades.basically a layman s analogy of said cousin s current task is   poison x ended people 3 decades ago  we collected data over 3 decades and we found poison x ends people  upon compiling this information we discover to our surprise that poison x still ends people me  like  durrrrr   poisons end people   you don t say!!!!!yet  i m the one with gender-related complications since birth  gender attribute hybridizations resulting in a  404 - sexuality not found  and people who don t know me personally scratching their heads wondering if i was born male or female  if i m trying to pass as male or female  and in general them having confusion over whether they think i m  trans or not .
lesssss gooooo tonight we party  in hogwarts  if you preordered the 72h early access deluxe edition
bahaha yup
can t wait to play myself here in few hours
i wonder how many people proudly advertised the fact that they will be streaming this game by adding themselves to the list
well said melmac
will be watching you play tomorrow.
someone should make a game called  that wizard game  just to troll
even if it wasn t good i d still put money into it just to spite them
the woke mob is a very small percent that tries to scare others into seeing things their way. i still waiting on the crying woke meme to appear somewhere  because its funny. we need to bring back the memes! stupid ppl get stupid prizes...lol well said mel.
woke mob uspset that this will get a sequel and not forspoken.
i wish i could send all these woke kids back to the 80s man that was a good time
evil will neva prevail. are you with me!!! for hogwarts!!!
the bottom score on that list of reviews was from the guardian.  they are so woke it s ridiculous and their game reviewer  keza macdonald  who describes herself on twitter as a  queer scottish millennial   is a prime example.she turned off her replies on twitter after her review dropped today - she didn t want to hear any replies.
if i buy it  it d probably be during some steam sale but i wouldn t mind giving this game a try. and i m no hardcore potter fan.
they are no longer calling for a boycott.
well i got the game because i m an old gamer and i literally got this game for two reasons firstly it looks good and secondly because i hate people telling me what to do with my hard earned money. if i want to play a game and become a wizard it s my choice especially while doing so i can dress up as a witch
you can customize your wand and have pets. let s go!
i have no intention of playing this game but only because it s not my type of game. so i gifted my buddy the deluxe edition so he came play this game early.
what absolutely cracks me up is the fact that harry potter actors that were crying about this game that made     millions haven t given their money back. pretending to be outraged.
it s good ha ha ha
people are literally saying they re gonna ban anyone who talks about it on their discords or streams haha. kotaku are making it blatant at their autism of not covering it. it s so weird that they didn t have this effect on the fantastic beasts movies
this girl is stuck at the gamer gate era
i really don t even understand what was the original issue with j k rowling in the first place. all i can find is some tweets where she voices her opinions  and tweets weren t even close to being outrageous  i was expecting something straight out of south park but the reaction to all this makes it look like she was murdering puppies. have i missed something
i m gonna play the hell outta this tonight.just goes to show. cancel culture only works if you let it.if i was buying  or not buying  based on the views of someone who i agree or don t agree with  i may as well stop buying everything. without full knowledge of the deepest thoughts and feelings of everyone who works on the project  you could be supporting a game or movie of someone who completely disagrees with you. i m not gonna live like that. and i sure as hell am not gonna be told what to like or dislike.
i want to use their tool to find out who to watch stream the game.
was it really a surprise  avalanche has a long history of decent games.
i m a big harry potter fan and all of the woke crying and screaming just made me want to buy the game more.
i can t wait to play it on the switch.  i think i ll get a twitch account  just so i can stream it.
i had seen a meme yesterday playing on the notion that people who bought hogwarts legacy acting as if everyone else is triggered because they had bought it and those whom they think they have triggered are not. if you had to go out and make a meme like that you are triggered.
thank you for this vid!!
the same people who preach about tolerance are rather intolerant of those of differing opinions.
i put it on reserve once i heard it was good lol
good news  the banner ad was for 100  us farm raised wagyu beef.bad news  i had to say something became the count was at 666.awesome news  hogwartz legacy ad played after your video.  positivity rewards with cool ads.
ya i get my game tomorrow and although i ve never streamed anything  i m thinking of streaming  that new wizard game .  why you ask  well first  i ll have an unmoderated chat so that i can record and post any hate and or woke rants.  second  cuz the game is gonna be dope af!
ign did what most of them will do. chase the money after the profit moved from bashing the game to covering it. they re all just fake. i really hope someone is keeping track of the before and after on this game s coverage. i preordered the deluxe and i hope they put put dlc later so i can buy that.
please review that halo needler !
thanks again for sharing
respect!
more like a victory for the ppl involved making the game...
things the twitter mob doesn t own free willintelligencesense of humorjoyi could go on but you get the idea
here they go again... a whole bunch of twitch streamers just got a whole lot of free subs  because this is going to backfire exactly like the boycott did.
backwards clown world i love it  but thats an insult to clowns tho
i wish someone would make a website to see who supports the woke crowd in this charade that would be awesome. that way we know who we can actually avoid.
i almost never buy video games at full price but after checking with the reviewers i trust most and then having this nonsense on top of it made me want to buy it new even more.  they act like a bunch of spoiled children.
well said mel
these internet trolls were never going to affect regular players  people who probably don t hear or care about the crap we are aware of.
now their failure is complete.
problem i have with all this is jk rowling is actually woke herself. so i m not going to support anything with her involvement no matter if her  own side  hates her. play stupid games get stupid prizes.
no one ever stand a chance to cancel it    niceeee
0 07 - coletrain cameo
i stand in solidarity with j.k rowling.
one twitter post from one of the triggered people really cracked me up  they said that the gameplay of hogwarts legacy looked like that of the callisto protocol
lowest score by the guardian was done by a non binary person who mostly just talked about jk rowling. so yeah that 60 is out of spite
i m going to buy this game and leave a 0.0 hour review just to piss off the screeching crowd
woke people see meta critic insert emotional damage meme here lol
haters be getting hit by the cruciatus curse left right and center loleven though i don t support what rowling s said  idgaf. i love the franchise  and i m gonna play the game. can t wait  pre-ordered the digital deluxe version
that game which shall not be named.
let s be fair  j.k. rowling is as a woke as they come. but... ultimately judge the rpg by its own merits  not by what the media wants you to judge it by.
i like harry potter and i support real women. so i just bought the game. this is coming from someone that normally waits for discounts on games before buying.
the-game-that-which-not-be-named
im starting to get paid opposition vibes from the calls to boycott  almost no one cares about the  issues  but plenty of news outlets do. so in this case even 100  negative reporting will bring tons of positive attention from paying customers.
you have made me use less swear words in my day to day.
bahaha love it
i don t agree with all of j.k s political views  but i can definitely support her views on the trans topic so far. and yes  i already pre-ordered the deluxe edition and playing it tomorrow after work. gonna try to make videos on it too.
well this tool is a double edged sword. just use it to sub to streams that play it and leave them a nice tip!
if your cat is not pregnant ... then you ve a health issue there  my god
there should be a metal critic that filters out all the scores and reviews that even hint at any cultural or political opinions.
twitter  how dare stream you know what!players  hogwarts legacy twitter  reeeeee
i m very happy that this game triumphed over the haters that sought to destroy it all. cry cry cry  haters.
how unspeakably pathetic that ign feel they have to put a disclaimer begging forgiveness for giving the game a good review. these people have no dignity  pride or integrity.
is it just me or does melonie look alittle like bellatrix lestrange lol
hogwarts legacy has more accessibility options for disabled gamers than any other game on the market. this alone makes the game a 10 10 for me.
i was never going to buy this game.   but them trying to force me not to buy this game us making me buy this game.   see everyone at hogwarts.
what i think is funny  is that these are the same people that i am sure bought tickets to see secrets of dumbledore to support the recast of johnny depp for which surprise surprise was based on a lie. so i laugh at this whole thing cause secrets failed for being woke and hogwarts legacy is a massive hit and it drives the woke mob nuts.
i was hoping it would got 70 80. so i m very happy. 80  it more gta  red dead games for me.
but  wait  a whole video and you did not mention lara croft
pretty sure this proves that review bombing is not an excuse for bad rating scores. if people like something they will support it.
i bought 3 copies
the way these people try to tell people what they must or mustn t do has all the similar makings of a regime  it s very extremist behaviour  i m sorry karen  my body  my choice
woke crazy   change your game for me!!me   what was the last game that you bought crickets  me  candy crush doesn t count
melonie what s the song at the end!  it sounds fire haha
prohibition and boycotts don t work. the more you make something controversial  the more interested people get in it. these people drove the value of hogwarts legacy through the roof.
their mad cause when i wrote my story  we stayed inside at night. why insulate a studio where i have a fridge to fill for myself
love it
sounds promising. still will never preorder a game.
imagine going on an absolute tirade  working every day to boycott a game just because the creator said men can t be women and women can t be men
iam not even a big fan of harry potter and preordered it twice.
the funny thing is people getting mad over the only decent harry potter game we re gonna see in a while. just goes to show it s a lot of people more worried about politics and their feelings instead of the actual gameplay.
can t wait for the last gen console release
who has played this game  i am thinking about buying it. games are just so expensive  so  i have to convince myself that it s worth the price
as someone who is a hardcore mortal kombat fan  please dont say flawless victory untless the win is 100  a 9 outta 10 means that hogwarts had to block a hit at least and a small amount if chip damage took away thier flawless. but it was indeed a fatality if not a brutality.
i m sad my delivery of the preorder physical game won t arrive till a week from today.
it s interesting how so many people on that side tend to preemptively block others to stay in their own little bubble. i also hate how some outlets block comments. like gamespot posted a whole article  explaing  the situation and they disable comments. so really they are  just attempting to tell others how to think. as usual.
i just made my video a few days ago about jk rowling living rent free in their heads.
the fact that people think we should cancel harry potter because the author has normal beliefs is annoying tbh. this game is gonna be awesome   i pre ordered
well  i mean  they really can t call out people for spending money on the game and saying it was dumb... they obviously put their money towards organizations that didn t really help any causes
thanks to youtuber ruined leon ive got this waiting to download as soon as its released
anyone else getting the feeling that this is just like what the religious people tried to do way back when  cancel harry potter  jeez that quote really was real. either die a hero  or live long enough to become the villain.  -paraphrased harvey dent
you reeeee as coletrain came in the door  and he jumped  xd!!!!!!
i never pre-order games or buy them for full price. the last game i did that was witcher 2. seriously thinking this game looks great and want to add my  70 for the playstation edition.
that site looks like a great way to find streamers to gift subs to...
0 07 chonky bean came in and ears immediately went back on the reeeee
this game will definitely get snubbed at the game awards  but if it does win goty it will be a huge win. but congrats to the devs for making a game they actually love doing because that s rare nowadays lolsuck it cancel mob
would love to play the game... unfortunately my poor ass has to wait till april cause i no have ps5.

i guess he s woke  sigh
@meloniemacgoboom  cuz esosilly yeseeiyuz! yeeyus!
what was done for those who didn t wish to be a big pharma medical experiment is now being done using the same playbook for anyone who comments positively online about this game. hahaha
saw you first on last fridays fnt. christian pop culture youtuber and steeler fan  subscribed.
woke tears are the most delicious because they are the saltiest.
the ps5 reddit is deleting any discussion of the game. to their credit  the mods basically said   it s obvious that the people on this sub cannot have a civil discussion about this game on its own merits  so we aren t going to bother with it .not surprising. reddit is basically a tenth level of hell.
because even the people who claim to hate rowling still wanted to play it. it was all talk and no walk.
the boycotte would have only hurt the games developers who spent years making it  jk is probably so rich that she wouldn t even notice
all i can say to all those that were bashing this game  hogwarts legacy  for stupid reasons is   i can not wait to play it tomorrow.  lol!
all i want to say is sirona ryan sirona ryan
those are some extraordinary tattoos
i m not a hp fan  but i m buying a copy to give one more l to the woke crowd
anyone else planning to play the gryffindor genocide simulator
my younger brother is playing it right now and we just found out there s a trans woman in the game. i didn t know there was trans people in the 1800 s
it might be a few weeks before i actually buy hogwarts legacy mainly because i m broke but it looks like i will buy it cuz i don t buy into this trans nonsense anyway thank you jk for restoring faith in humanity
it baffles me that someone would actually take the time to code something like this.
i don t think this is really a  win  for anyone  except those on the outside that just want to play a fun game. the devs of the game caved and said they fully support the trans woke narrative. so  even though the game is good  the wokies still got a win  even if they are too short sighted to see it.
plot twist... this entire fiasco was just publicity for the game lol
never change.
honestly j.k. rowling was always a mixed bag for me. mainly because of the amount of retconing in her books. but i m glad that she takes a stance this time around  not giving in to the woke mob and also big probs on avalanche studios not cucking to this day.also you don t need to be a feminist to say that men don t belong in women sports  bathrooms etc. that is just common sense.
cancel culture loss todays fight and i will play hogwarts legacy because it looks like a great game
thank you so much!    -
i don t get why it s harry potter in particular that draws these people s ire. seen so many acting like playing it is actually evil when you know for sure they ve played stuff by far worse people. seems more like they re just concerned about themselves and wanting people to do what they want rather than actually having any consistent morals.
some of the posts i ve seen today are wild. these people are actually insane  there is no other word for it.
lol... overall  reeeeehhhhhh   on the background cats is paralyzed in shock of this mysterious noise
i never thought i d see the day when a christian is defending harry potter. we live in strange times
i m calling them the reeeeeee cult from now on
they can cry all they want but nothing will stop people from buying a good game. jk has done nothing wrong except talk facts which in todays society is condemned. can t wait to play this
i miss when we learned things through studies and facts.now we only consume opinions and world views twisted by the parents of x and y youtuber.lol
well said...
that s a new level of low making a website to see who s streamed a game they want to enjoy and spend their money on how they want after they ve earned it
i just wish it didn t have denuvo.    -
i haven t played any games in a while but i might just make an exception.
the devs at avalanche are trailblazers in my opinion  whether they want to be or not. i hope this will be a wake up call to the entertainment industry that you don t have to bow down to the woke mob to be successful.
that reeeeee
we need a new term outside of karen for this. karen is a term for the older generation.
can you do that again !  reeeeeeeeee
i find it funny how the more these crazy people complain  the more people are interested in this hogwarts legacy. it s glorious  my best friend preordered this game because one he s a massive harry potter fan and two he wants to make these weirdos cry. i for one am sick and tired of these entitled weirdos trying to shove their political nonsense down our throats. i hope we get to explore the more dark aspects of the wizarding world and the lore as well. the possibilities are endless.
you could tell the game journalist wish they could give it a bad review like the good old days when mk8 got a 5 10 on kotaku cause it runs 59fps instead of 60fps to fuel console war bs.
explain how someone else can take your power away  plus what power do u mean
games radar  ign reviewers in general don t   sway me at all i buy want i want
i m not a big harry potter fan but it s just nuts seeing all the people just hating on it and saying how bad it is by not even playing it. also shitting on it saying it s just paid reviews and not really that good. like come on
karen is a term for a state of mind  not age. one can never be too young or old to be a karen. karen is an ideal  karen is eternal.
soemtimes i forget how pretty you are. thanks for remembering - would - as a man of culture
whats your fav gfuel flavor mel  these ppl will give in to pressure and buy it later down road
love the thumbnail lol
it s always so good seeing those loud minorities  wake crowd and etc being shown players doesn t care about all their political crap and just want to play good games.
cat vidbomb at 15 seconds...yes  i m a cat mom  i noticed. lol
nice to see that the woke community implemented a  do you follow a non pure arian database   search engine...
now i see the woke say they win because there a trans bartender but some got mad when one said in a magical world that you can have a potion that change your appearance would be more normal lol
i bought 2 copies just because of the woke haters
it s mind blowing how much attention and importance transgenders get while woman have fought centuries for equal rights and they still are fighting..
0 06 oh. there s a cat!
i really want a game that intentionally attacks and mocks the woke. it would be a joy to play
the game is great though has many woke elements...
i pick up my 3 copies tomorrow. i m not going to play it. i don t like herry potter. but my brothers do. lol
i m not a hairy plodder fan  but hearing that hogwarts legacy was  racist   piqued my interest. how stunning and brave it would be in 2023 to come out with a game that was actually racist! it would show a complete disdain for things like... profitability.
100  facts
still a sceptic. i get the feeling that they are  forward just to trick conservative  former hp fans  into buying this game  to fund the next big woke agenda for the franchise. i use to be a potter head back before rowling retconned all her characters for woke fan service.
the absolute cope from the gaming journos who are forced to concede the game is good is glorious !theyre practically crying  dont cancel me !  at their audience .
imagine having  men are not women and women are not men  being an  extreme vew
it s amazing to me that the very people calling for acceptance and tolerance are the ones that deny it to others over something as silly and unimportant as game.
omgoodness i love you!
it changed from time to time  but cotton candy and blue bomber slushie are my faves of the energy formulas and shiny splash from the hydration formulas  d
@meloniemacgoboom  i ve had blue bomber haven t tried others now i mist put other flavors in my list to try ty!
i mean  these are the same people accusing everyone of being an antisemite but spend all their time preaching how religion is source of all evil and harm against religious people  so  you know. hypocrisy is their forte.
sounds like you will be having lots of fun with this game and drinking the tears of leftys with some g-virus... i mean g-fuel  please do not become a resident evil mutant villain  this might happen drinking to much lefty tears xdps.  i saw your playstation sweater picture  it is to revealing.  you have reaveald to me you dont play enough halo  you need an xbox or halo sweater also or you gotta send me your needler sitting by the angelina joelie statues.    p
flawless victory for the psy-op that it is - a woke game tricking people into buying and supporting it.
but.... i wanna dunk on the woke...also this game slaps!
i didn t even want to buy the game. i am not such a great harry potter-fan. but now i preordered it because woke idiots want to dictate me what to play. you  melonie mac  persuaded me to take action.
ign s yt review had a pinned like apology comment  and i tried to say  stay in your lane and stick to video games  to join the thousands of ppl ratio ing them but it keeps saying the comments won t go through
saw this in the online store for months.had 100  no interest in buying.after all this nonsense and seeing what she actually said which was in no ways anti trans this is ridiculous i said if i saw enough things that look good i ll but it.i did.i preordered it.i played the hell out of it last night til i got tired.it s very good so far
i don t need to get hogwarts legacy   i m good with the forspoken game   it looks better
it s funny how we refer to these people as woke... when the last thing they are is... awake.
screw you woke cancel culture! i m gonna get this game just in spite of you even though i m a huge harry potter fan haha
im a streamer this is not my main account this is a sock account. and im gonna stream the game day one  i don t care about the backlash twitter is not real life and i just wanna share the love for the ip and have fun with chat and maybe make some nee friends while flying the broom around hogwarts
i might as well recycle comments since it s my exact reaction to this topic  i just placed it in yellowflash2 s comments earlier. their ideaology and concerns mean nothing to me  they are zombies.to clarify my disposition  did you know there was a fallout new vegas knock off game released a few years ago called  the outer worlds  i didn t until a few days ago. i love fallout 3  nv  and the regular gameplay  not the outpost building  of fallout 4. but i hate the living      out of the outer worlds enough i refuse to play any more of it.it was 10  brand new  despite being released in a more stable beta build  by obsidian  than any bethesda game i have ever played  always released as alpha . but the outer worlds is painfully woke trash.if these zombies actually cared about their own declared values  we would have all heard about the space rpg the outer worlds   it would be a meme itself for how well it was programmed but how terribly cringe the plot becomes. but they don t care. they re not gamers. they re not in love with cinematography. they don t care about even the basics of creating a simple storyline. they are a zombie hoard and they only want to consume your brain.  - me  an hour ago
is that tool able to find me streamers that streamed hogwarts  to find me a normal people  it s big  there is not many other reasons not to play it than being a coward or idiot  to watch
remember folks  talk with your wallet.
omg wat a thumbnail
i bought the deluxe version of the game  like all of my friends! we are not the greatest fans of the whole potter-franchise and don t read the books  we just want to support it against these woke little fascists.
all that whining and the game actually had representation.
i hear the rees like mandrakes and it rules
i m torn  rowling is a hero who stood up to the woke mob  yet is also a troubling individual with regards to certain other things she says and does. i guess everyone s complex. i praise her for acting sane here  and for creating such a great world  but also can t stand her representation of domestic abuse n such. her favouritism of hermoine only to have her beat up ron and bully others  i worry about how she sees guys sometimes in case she cares not for violence against men.
i will be playing a lot of this gamw
bahaha thank you so much for the super thanks! and yes  i use hater tears to mix my g fuel in i do love me some halo 3  haven t played halo in too long tho indeed
@meloniemacgoboom   i actually love all the new halos.  no spoilers.  i think 4 has the best story  its pvp feels like an alt version of 3  i cant decide what i like most.   5 story is good but no where near the best.  pvp and pve online i had loads and loads of fun  warzone and warzone fire fight was a big time sink for me.  halo infinite had a great story  pvp is a disaster for me  i need a spartan laser to bust me some tanks  and theirs no spartan lasers to be had in infinite for whatever reason and theirs no incentive to try and take enemy player vehicles.   i took my time to kill the drivers without destroying the vehicles and after doing so  the vehicles always blow up if you kill the driver  unlike other halo games.i am very sad what has happened with 343  i was looking forward to getting lots of halo campaign story content  and it sounds like that dream is as dead as joe biden rally.
i m buying it..!!

i can t stand jk because she is liberal as hell and needs to keep her nose out of our politics  but i love it when she owns the super weirdos. and by the way if you re a potter fan like my wife and i this game rocks.
you re a steelers fan  awesome!
people are getting so desperate about this that i ve now been told multiple times  you can t support her  you know rowling hates men  too . like it matters. good  you know what  i m glad she hates men. good for her for having her own opinion. like i m supposed to hate her because she doesn t like men  first of all  if she really hated all men  i m pretty damn sure she wouldn t have written over a dozen books with a competent male protagonist. secondly  even if she did hate all men. she s a single person with no power over me living on the other side of the planet  why should i be offended  on behalf of all men  some men are trash  some women are trash  as long as you re not harming anyone  hate whoever you want. why are people so obsessed with being categorically liked
i did here the pc version has issues. it s a bummer   instead of putting that out more  we keep getting nonsense far off from the topic.
as someone who doesn t give a fuck about harry potter  this has been better entertainment than anything marvel released after end game
rowling did nothing wrong. common sense and sanity are on her side.
ignore these people. they ain t cancelling shit.
jk rowling is not an elephant in the room. it s just one they made up. besides  elephants are cool! i d much rather hang out with an elephant than a wokist. when was the last time an elephant accused you being bigoted for something as stupid as liking a video game
its not so easy with out those twitter bots. cant reach those normis
i dunno  i was hyped to get it but recently it s been brought to a lot of people s attention that they shoehorned a trans character in there and now myself and many others are cancelling and refunding. pretty stupid of them to add that pointless garbage but seems unavoidable now days. back to retro games and select indie titles for me.
there are plenty of charitable organizations that would benefit immensely from all of this time wasted  but no  someone made a tracker for who has streamed a particular game. way to embarrass the human race.
im going to use that to follow lol
before we all forget  rowling isn t exactly a champion of conservative thought. i m happily surprised that she took the road of reality and common sense in the regard of trans bs - but she is a very active supporter of the labour party and highly critical of trump s administration and by proxy the republican party  as is her right  - but let s do try to keep things in perspective.
unpacking her new 4k monitor to play and stream hogwarts legacy on huh what  i can t see the woke mod haters. oh wait  i don t care!wizarding world  here we come !
here s what s ironic.as much as there was reason to worry that this game would turn out bad  like a no man s sky or fallout 76 or cyberpunk 2077...where these folks trying to cancel hogwarts legacy would have some modicum of satisfaction of seeing how  mid  or  bad  it was  and seeing fans of the game post about the game being bad  or worse broken...the game is looking like it s really good  even great  in the eyes of those reviewing it. is it perfect  no. is it a masterpiece  no. instead  it looks like it s the kind of game that harry potter fans have been wanting to play for so long  and it took a new studio to make it happen. and that s what a lot of fans of the series want...to just play a good  even great  harry potter game. and i am looking forward to it this week when my copy arrives.
being called a transphobe is the crown of phobe next to fatphobe. i preorder it not cause i m a harry potter fan just the boycott and the game looks good. i m strict with my money but i don t mind to spend for the meme and lols of it.
it s so hypocritical  these people don t want people controlling who they or where they go but it s totally ok for them to attack and control what others play and think. completely backwards if you ask me.
too bad it s an open world rpg or i d be more interested in playing it.
wokeness is losing on every front... apparently  trolling on social media isn t a sure fire way to victory.
same here lol i m so glad harry potter pissed the woke mobsters.
it s sad that this is what the videogame industry has become  a battleground for political and social nonsense.
10 hours from now i will be playing this game. i look forward to it. congrats leftist you are losing numbers because of this.
unless it was a play from cancel-culture marketing 101  of course.
melonie looks innocent  but we all saw the truth on friday - proof how she molested poor az.
i m from europe and must admit didn t know all this debate. it seems a noisy minority  but very noisy. in usa you have all the racial things solved  yes  it remains  feelings   but not on laws. in europe also is the same. but travel to china  or africa or middle east  damn they really ave racial and social and female problems... i bet any usa woke wouldn t survive a day in one of those countries. they have the immense luck of live in the most tolerant society in the entire history of the world  the western culture  but they apparently hate the only culture in which they would live  lol.
that disclaimer is ridiculous and nothing but disingenuous and gaslighting.  ign s  views  are only supported by a small minority of vocal activists. the vast majority of harry potter fans and generally in the world fully support rowling and her views when it comes to women and children s basic human rights.
i love you  thank you
i guess we need to open up a new league of everything for trans people then. trans only bathrooms  trans only games etc. the translympics would be pretty awesome and absolutely crackup at the same time.
someone call these people a wabulance
the question is  how  woke  is j.k. though  i don t think she s like these woke activists. she may be liberal  but she wasn t insufferable about it like these people are. from what i understand.
i m glad it s doing well. they have trans characters in the game  have trans friendly character customization. the devs made it very inclusive  kudos to them!
they not gonna cancel gta  we be running around punching random grandmas in the face
i m not a fan of harry potter  and have religious objections to it. however  i can only present the objections  i can t force people to not read the books or  in this case  play the game. the same goes with smoking  drinking  use of contraceptions  drug use in general  and even abortion. as long as something is legal  and even when illegal  all i can due is try to persuade against. what both the religious right had done in the past was just as bad as what woke leftists are doing now. the main difference is most christians have come to realize that certain aggressive tactics not only don t work  but backfire.
they put that goofy ass disclaimer so the weirdo trans activists wouldnt come for their necks
i m not against trans rights. i m a gamer that s pro good games. i wanna play this because i want to play a good game. i get this is kind of a contested battle between  the woke mob   gamers and the hard right  but when you start quoting the bible like some psycho religious zealotwe all lose
it just works!
this is gamergate 2 hopefully this will stop the woke mind virus from tearing apart a good game
bet that tool will also backfire. it ll probably increase the traffic of those streamers.
seriously it seemed like every single redditor was just making shit up to say this game was gonna suck despite never having played iti could give a fuck less about hp and i ll never play this but a few of my friends are big fans and i m happy they re going to get a great game to play
most people don t know... they are told jkr is bad  so they repeat it.  i ve talked to people like that and we went through and looked at what jkr has said and they were like  where is the bad stuff she said    its all peer pressure
i.g.n. will always champion human rights causes  meaning it will not last when those cause are cast aside in favour of something better. i.g.n.   i guess not.
good
i don t mess with jeepers creepers but i really don t care if anyone else watches it lol
this guy is playing the internet and capitalizing on the attention of this game. he s getting a lot of traction too lol! i don t know what benefit or return comes from the website getting hit hard but it s coming straight to him!
jk rowling didn t write the game nore did she have any involvement making this game  google even states this.
416k viewing it on twitch already.
i am just thinking like  a destiny rip off ...... like whaaaaat............ like if we are talking about the same destiny destiny 2 game.... i am just wondering like how in the     did they think this is anywhere close to that.... with the release time where i live on pc going to get the game in 4h 15minutes and i am super exited.....  and just saying  but i have over 1.5k hours in the destiny games and i am still exited xd
the best thing is  now companies can see  what happens  if you don t get a f about them or mock them  success. money. so maybe it has consequences. keep in mind  they lost star wars  lotr  marvel  they slowly destroy dc. what s left to make money  should they create something new  i don t think they can. so i think  they will continue with fantastic beasts  and maybe reboot hp. or j.k.r. comes up with new stuff. people are interested in a lot of stories from hp. voldemort for example. or how they founded hogwarts. i t s a huge success. it s important  why it s that successful. j.k. now sees  1 4 century after the first books  a whole generation after her first books  people still are interested in hp.i would love if she now writes something about how hogwarts was founded. they could focus on griffindor or slytherin. they totally could make multiple parts. it would be medieval. usually that s not that risky. if it s wizards  20th century was far more risky. now the fanbase is here  for new hp stuff.imo the fun thing here is  there won t be representation  if she makes something about how they founded hogwarts. medieval england and scottland. would be hilarious if j.k. decides  it s time for that  because people really are interested in this story. imo it s not just a l. it s total destruction. the narrative is proven wrong. go woke  go broke. go anti-woke  and tell them openly  you don t care  and mock them a bit  and you get money  and very entertaining meltdowns aswell. even if it s a huge echo chamber  maybe hollywood will learn now. even if not  even if there won t be consequences  it s very entertaining atm  and we can expect more. so let s wait. i am very curious about the numbers. because for me  6 months ago i didn t even know about this game. the most successful games usually are simulators  or stuff without story. stuff like fifa  gta. there are successful rpgs aswell  but a lot of them are huge franchises  or have multiple parts. are around for a long time. not the first game after  10 years or so  and everything after part 3 wasn t really good. so if it s somewhere like other successful rpgs  or even like fifa  it s because of that. i would bet  1 2 of the sales are thanks to the so called boycott. i would bet  1 2 of the people who bought deluxe instead of standard did it because of the twitter activism. i really hope  this can change something.  because now you get real numbers. not just tweets from activists without rl  so they seem to be the majority. no  real numbers  real sales. so let s hope it changes some things in the entertainment industry
looking forward to buy this game   play it just to spite these losers
the game wasnt cancelled because the same corporations that agree with the woke cult  had too much money invested in this game to give them their way  this one time. in other words -- the woke cult didnt lose....actually  it was just funded for another year. we are acting like there was some victory against them. there wasnt. it just shows that the video game industry never has to listen to the woke cult -- but it does....and it will.....because if it needs some money  it can just jiggle its zipper and we all go running back with our wallets open.
kind of wish there was a reverse of these sites  so that you can just block anyone who used it from seeing anything you do online.
the haters are jealous cause the game is really amazing worth the 70 dollars
you remind me of pokimane  but actually organic and smart.
i m so excited to play this game that i upped to the deluxe edition to get early access. and i did some digging and research on jk rowling there s only maybe 2 transphobic comments she s made but only after trans activists doxxed her and sent death threats... i would have done the same if it was me because screw that
did candis owen s make that website  jkjk. couldn t help myself. i ll see myself out
as the god of war i identify as a xenopho and my pronouns are.. ammsdnxnen
god bless you
woke is already a cringe term  you ve just made it that much more.
they are so desperate to the point they became more and more like a villain of society. if they act like that i don t mind being called bigot instead of living on their side.i don t know jk rowling until the internet talking about her non stop  i just watched 1 movie of harry potter and it is when i was a child  i don t even read their book. so yeah i m not fan of harry potter to begin with but one thing i know  is i love games and rpg open world is one of my fave genre. also roleplay as a wizard  say no more.the game is good and i like it so far  and the frame rates are more fluid than forspoken. i played forspoken to appreciate other games better than that. the spell system is way more interesting and depth and also lore which makes sense why do those spells exist to begin with  compared to forspoken where you got new spells and thats it  no explanation why. so yeah after few hours playing hogwarts legacy  i could say it is a good game so far.
if you want to play it  it s ok but keep in mind that the game has a trans npc
this phobic  that phobic. these people use those words so much that it s completely worn out the meaning and i just don t care anymore.
melonie the hogwarts legacy backlash reminds me of the early 2000s when right wing lawyer jack thompson tried to get gta banned
seethe npcs  seethe!
do you not like wearing your jackets properly
the only reason they want this game to fail is because they have not been able to break j. k. rowling. that s the point these people on the left sink if they can break her and get her to bend the knee to them and they want she like a few others in hollyweird have been cancel proof and that frustrates them because they want everyone to bend the knee i m a gay man i don t been to the left. i give them the middle finger.
still getting the game  i mean tbh jk rowling did said some questionable things. but the money that game makes mostly go to the dev and wb that supported the game  so ur telling me just because one person that has creative involvement with the game  meaning we can t give any support to the dev  every big game is made by a team of people  and i am sure some of them has questionable political agenda. with this logic we pretty much cannot buy any games or any products.
it s funny how the game has the series first openly transgender character in the game
now they are trying to cope because their is a transcharacter in the game  nevermind we already knew about that.
you re not woking right.
today i won t remind you to drink water. everyone have a wonderful day.
oh and this is just the beginning by the way when company s see how successful this game is they will all do the same and tell the woketards to go do one hell it might get to the point where company s poke fun at the woketards due to the people now waking up really disliking them will use it as a marketing means.
you realize cyber punk tried to support the blurry lines of sexuality and it was a shit game.
beautiful cat as well
hi just wanted to say as a member of lgbt i really hate the woke twitter bullshit. these people should get banned for bullying. this game is great. also if it was transphobic to buy harry potter im fucked anyway. i still love harry potter. edit  disclaimer of course i haven t played it but so much footage on it makes me wanna get it. have it pre-ordered too
can t wait to become a bigot by playing this game tomorrow!!
ah yes the boycott is strong and effective and.. wait 89 for ps5 one  86 for the xbox series 83 for the pc version  whut  why didn t all those game review websites and youtubers go with the boycott  how dare they give it a good thorough review
so tired of politics. i hope we look back on the 2010s-2020s with cringe at how politics was so central to everyone s identity. just play the damn game  its fun.
that cat is huge
hey pretty melonie and fat cat  so yeah jk rowling must be really happy knowing hogwarts legacy  got great reviews so time to enjoy a cool game.
there s a trans character in the game and it s literally the most uncomfortable thing mostly because it was just very unnecessary
jack thompson was a registered democrat. you fell for prog revisionism.
@alset85   i watched count dankulas video on him to see if i messed up no
it is a woke game. i don t know why their so mad
eff those snowflakes!!!!
this is all well and good  but......  kittehh!!!
booyaa! take that wokies!
that is a chonker of a cat.

love those exposed shoulders.
i still think there are only 2 genders  ill be buying this game keep up the good work
sooo  a virtual shit lers list
i have a crush on this girl
why does it sound like at best putin made this game
dang pop off miss!
i have to get up tomorrow at 5 and should go to bed and not watch your videos  can you please stop saying the truth and look so cute while you are doing this
that website needs to be shutdown before someone crazy happen. that s just a website made to harass ppl.
coaltrain!
el gato  d 0 05
you have a funny accent but it s cool tho
if you follow them... why would you need to search  so basically its just a tool to get pissed at ppl you dont follow lol
all the developers need to cancel the woke.
victoreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
resetera have gone bat shit crazy with this too. you can t even create a thread or talk about the game without getting a ban  like isn t that the entire point of a forum  to have discourse
anyone have any extra salt i can borrow
hellllllllllllllllllllllllllllll yeahhhhhhhhh let s goooooooooooooooooo yeah awesome i m so excited that the woke community has fall they deserve to fell awesome hogwarts legacy will always be the best game ever
you can t tell ignorant without ign.also while i m at it-- 7.8 out of 10 too much water.
remember folks  when you can t win arguments on merit  crushing authoritarianism is just as good! brought to you by stalin mao inc.
my crush s name is karen!
i bought the deluxe version just to stick it too the idiots  may play it now
this is a call to action for wokies to harrass streamers. the maker of this website needs to be indicted for incitement of any potential riots or other crimes that result from this.
you know who else made lists  these people are not on the right side of history lol.
why do you keep ignoring that the devs put identity politics in the character creation
i hate  harry potter  modern feminism and the woke mob  so this complete cluster   is hilarious to watch
isn t it interesting how they all still play wow and diablo and other games from problematic companies like ubisoft but nobody seems to have to mention these  ethics  disclaimers
all kinds of cope in the comments. they couldn t control people this time so now they re salty.
commenting to feed the algorithm
do you have only fans page
i don t have any interest in this game but because of cancel culture i purchased it to counter their cancel culture
jeez people need to sperate the art from the artist. the woman didn t even help make the game
hey cutiejk rules
meta 89 on xbox xd
your favorite character will be the trans character the developers included in support of trans
this is very bad for the wokesters and they are fuming over it! and it s amazing  let them cry and whatever  they can t do anything about it  bro! people are allowed to support what they want and they are going to support this game if they want to! this is so insane! they cannot handle it and they re so furious that they ve lost and she won by not bending to these woke freaks  it is dangerous to them and it s hilarious and so funny to witness and watch as they throw temper tantrums and freak out all over nothing for this game! and just love it so much  man!
love you
i m not interested in it at all  but it s fun to watch the freaks getting so angry about it.
great start.  now it s time to take america back in 2024
and you forgot manipulating people
u want to debate hunter  exactly.
why are these non-gamers trying to boycott our stuff. bunch of posers and grifters. but thanks for the advertising help newbs!
i preorder this game because of this reeeeee from lgbtqxyz
yay
we won! now they re putting together a hit list like some hs loser
0 07 cat
why are y all calling them  woke   the  woke  is calling out the agenda not arguing for it.. or am i missing something
will you be streaming on yt
gurrrlll you look good
imagine being so upset about a videogame you create a database that keeps track of all the streamers that play it. goodness how embarrassing.
so angry...
what does woke mean
cat
out of their way  - 30 minutes.... scrape some api data  booh-hoo.
the game is woke... but i support to rowling
twitch.tv meloniemac
thank you!  _
@meloniemacgoboom  want you so much.
0 08 got that auto tune on
only who streamed on twitch  i streamed on youtube
sick of the  own the libs  theme...rowling is pretty far to the left...them eating each other is fun...but hardly a victory.
can t wait to get my conservative cisgender white male wizard on!
we continue to champion human rights ....are women not human  do they not have rights also
the she  her trans gang lost and took an l.
cat
imagine being so weak  you think your existence is threatened by a video game about wizards   witches. i laugh at these clowns.
like with the last of us part 2 and ragnocock reviews don t mean anything those games were both cringe boring aganda trash and the original last of us and god of war 2018 were masterpiece but soynee hates men and lost all the people with talent do to there scumbag ways lets hope gta6 doesn t do like they said and go the taints row direction
people are fucking crazy. you can t blame a consumer for the actions of a brand or company. you can t say that everton that buys stuff from the many companies of nestle is for child labour.
just play the game!!!!!! geez lol your complaining about them interrupting what j.k. meant even though she never said that and your hear doing the same thing just on a completely different side. just enjoy the game and have opinions about the game.
i believe in two genders  what you choose to do with your own body is ur choice. now if i ever see a unicorn or a leprechaun in real life  i will consider re-evaluating my thinking on two genders
fat and soft looking cat  3
i pre ordered it and i can t wait. for anyone in the mob who wants to call me out  come the fuck at me because i don t care we don t represent the minority
they literally gave good reviews that were non-bias and you still accuse media of  not wanting  to give good reviews  low blow.
lol
alright...great video............but who wears a hoodie like that
i don t care about jk rowling i preordered it cause i love harry potter not cause of the person who created it and by the way libs keep on going reeeee
disappointed that you cater to vindictive zoomers with their  karen  meme
hey there s a idea let s call boycott on the woke groups instead no
exactly!
i ve tried putting him on a diet and he gets so mad
me
@meloniemacgoboom  well .hate to break it to ya..you wear it like a weirdo
yes  but also she did nothing wrong and her views are perfectly sensible.
marketing in the us has become brain dead  it s wall street.  a complete loss of creativity.
seeing this bs makes me wish i was born in the ancient times..i m so lucky  to live in a muslim country i don t have to deal with this shit in real life
game of the year 2023
girlfriendreviews live stream got bombarded by the wokies and made them pause playing the game.
how is it a destiny rip off when destiny is a titanfall 2 ripoff lmao
reeeeeeeeeeeeee
reeeeeeeeeeee
i like these transgender woman pretenders who proclaim they are more of an woman than a biological woman.
this proves how crazy democrats are  and yet all people want to do is play the game once it gets released.
i gave this video 2 views
that wizard game   what about the witches  whoever crated that is a misogynist.
i don t care about the hate  i just don t like the harry potter universe  i ve never liked it  and the books are written really badly. i m not playing a game were i don t like the universe.
kind of a weird  own  when the game has trans characters in it...
kitty! love cats. these people are all freaking hypocrites.cant wait to play hogwarts legacy.
game seems to suck though
seems lame to try and boycott and not say what you are boycotting wizard  ....after disney destroyed star wars i was angry but after pushing for children to take puberty blockers i down right boycott any disney product.
and the game is woke anyways
the cringe of that intro.... dude clean it up
the activist reviews should be removed immediately.
titanfall
it s still a w. their boycott didn t work
@bodyweightbuff still miss my merry.
anyone who buys this game doesn t care about trans rights. i bought 2 copies.
first time seeing the channel why are you shouting so hard  if i were to judge by the webcam i d say this is a chill cute feminine video but no you re just destroying your vocal cords wtfalso don t care still playing hogwarts legacy
more like braless victory. because rowling is a feminist  who thinks hermione is strong empowered wakandan woman.
first
i don t support rowling s transphobic statements but i will most likely play the game.
rofl!
