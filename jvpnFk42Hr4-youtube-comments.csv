I was almost 400 lbs before I was 20  under 200 now and 33 years old  and no one can convince me that being fat is okay when I know what it feels like to have back pain and neck pain from just walking a few houses down the street to get a slurpy at the gas station.I understand if someone is fine with being big but I just cant get behind celebrating being so unhealthy.
I dont understand how its fatphobic to want to get yourself in better shape and promote a healthier lifestyle  especially when youre not even going out of the way to put down others...these people are deranged!
the fat acceptance movement can be be summed up in a sentence   attractive men must love us fat chicks or else!
as a former competitive martial artist I used to regularly go on extreme weight cuts  overseen by pros  and I know how easy it can be to become obsessive over tiny changes in weight and even after I stopped competing I struggled to accept my body when I viewed it as anything less than perfect  which is by definition unobtainable. based on my experiences I agree with what body positivity is supposed to be  which is  be happy with healthy . but damn these people make me angry when they encourage others to be unhealthy and shorten their life spans.
melonie  you seem to be very empathetic to all walks of life.  I find itsad that people that would unfriend you for wanting to be healthy and for holding different views.
I was in a car accident last year around march. a 6 car pile up  I was generally ok thankfully but when I went to the er and I saw my weight  I was 268. im 5 10 and thatshocked me. I instantly knew I had to change. I started eating much better and working out every other day. Im currently 215 and I haven t felt this good in a long time. I bulked up and slimmed down. I would highly recommend everyone work out and dont be fat! melonie you should be happy at your body progress I know I am! I used to wear xxl  now Im down to l! I still wear xl because I like bigger clothes.
Im not sure when people lost the distinction between fat shaming and pushing someone to take better care of themselves for their own good.  I think as long as a person isn t severely depressed  being prodded to get healthy can be a very good thing. I wish my friends and family had pushed me harder to get back to the gym when I weighed nearly 300 lbs. it took being diagnosed as diabetic to get me to start making changes. since then  Ive discovered your channel  and through you dr. berry  which has me feeling healthier than I have in years.
I think it was about 3 months ago now when I said that you helped inspire me to get in shape. well  I am down 25lbs  10  body weight  and started taking the first step of building muscle  push ups  crunches  light weights  etc. . still have about another 15 to 25 pounds before I am happy with the weight  but I will continue to get healthy. thank you for doing what you do.
being overweight is unhealthy. smoking is unhealthy. we dont pull punches when discussing smoking  everyone knows its bad and no smoker is trying to gaslight you and say its healthy. being overweight is almost exactly as bad as being a smoker  they both increase risk of heart problems  both significantly reduce life expectancy  both significantly reduce physical endurance and quality of life. you can smoke  you can eat too many calories  I wont stop you because thats your decision  but dont try to convince me that I have a problem because I dont want either for myself.
started to watch this video casually but it gradually became extremely informative. I thought caloric deficit was pretty much all you need for dieting but after watching your video I am 100  convinced that having enough protein is the key. caloric deficit without enough protein can backfire with binge eating extreme hunger muscle loss etc. awesome video. thanks.
you hit the nail on the head of being fat as someone s visible flaw. Im so tired of this fat acceptance movement. Im a guy and Ive struggled with my weight through high school  even had an eating disorder during my sophomore year  and struggled during college. after I got out of college I got in shape but then when the pandemic happened I gained a lot of weight from alcohol consumption  depression and bad eating habits. now Im seeking specialized therapy and detoxing and am losing weight and its hard but at the same time I feel a lot better about myself.
oh  I just read  progressive fat labia ! why  God  why... a  fat spectrum   and not in the head  isn t this some kind of body dysmorphia  Im serious  it is an obsession about something on the body  its not healthy  mentally speaking... no one can convince me that a person who believes in  fat spectrum  does not think about that 24 7. it must be exhausting! its also some narcissus shite  its like they fell in love with the fact that they re fat and cant help themselves on reaffirming it in every aspect of life...if youre obsessed about something  people will be able to tell and they ll treat you differently. if you cant be naturally fat to the point of having to invent a  spectrum   the problem is not in the physique... a fat person could be skinny as all heiI  crazy is crazy and its not worth it.
anyone who uses the term  fatphobic  deserves to be laughed at.
from personal experience melonie is very supportive of people that are working on their bodies. she regularly leaves comments on my pics when I have visited the gym. Im overweight so melonie isn t fat phobic she only wants the best for her followers. keep it going melonie you inspire me to do better.
losing weight  having muscles   eating healthy is awesome
early europeans used to know how to remove toxins from plants by blanching in streams and other techniques that are now lost. ray mears did a series on it. really great vid melanie
I know you think you went a little long with yesterdays stream but I found it quite informative.   your streams when you discuss things you are passionate about like your faith and nutrition seem to fly-by quickly.  I give it five stars out of five.
before I even finish this video I just want to say its a real shame how offended your friend became. you are one of the kindest and most thoughtful people I have met. you always explain your points and remain respectful to other points of view. you are really under-appreciated but the people who really try to understand you can see how amazing you are.
excellent nutrition rant melonie ! yes  hyperinsulinemia from years of carbaholism is the etiology of the epidemic. I would love to see you create another channel focused on nutrition and carnivore.
as a human that went from 280lbs to 200lbs in 1yr  self control is it. thats it. thats all it takes. I got tired of the shame I felt. and feel much better now.
hey  congratulations on loosing half of the beef! if Ive learned anything in life its that  fatness and social media confirming your bias are severely unhealthy!
dude congrats on losing so much weight. respect
I was about there and struggling to loose the last 50  but I got other issues unfortunately related to when I was really overweight that affect mobility.    Im working on being a muscular 225.need to add Im 6 2 .
damn congratulations that is definitely a feat worth wearing on your shoulder! you did good by you I applaud thatsir.
their kryptonite is accountability. in most cases  they are their own enemy.
and be a 6666 ft   6 in  and 6 figuresnevermind that thats less than 10  of the male population
but it doesnt work the other way
less than 10  for each value total.  10  of 10  is 1 . 10  further is .1 that just exemplifies the odds of being a 6 6 6
same as a lot of other  movements  it all seems to come down to ugly people demanding the attractive ones date them. now I fall into the ugly side but I would never demand some hot woman must date me or else. its all so ridiculous
@mikepette  same here my man. below average looking  short but kind of active man here  I have just returned from my daily hike . women should know their worth. its the hogzillas who demand to date the chads who are the problem.
the problem with our society noadays is that just being 268 should be more than enough to start doing something about your health without having to see the actual number  you only need a mirror. dont misunderstand me  im not trying to be mean to you  and I truly respect your efford  but imagine how comfortable we ve become that you have to reach such a number for the realisation to hit you
come on man nobody wants to hear facts  we want to live in our fantasy worlds where nutritions are oppressive! haha
smoking is good fr you. keeps the weight off.
I kid you not  this is so true! I decided to go strict keto this last month and learned so much about the human body and energy usage! the key to keto is reaching ketosis  minimizing carbs and increasing fat and protein. Ive lost 26 ibs in one month. thank you melonie always for your encouragement and reassurance!
I only found your channel a weeks ago or so. your content is great. its kind of funny because I was at a restaurant yesterday for breakfast and I left thinking about how healthy eggs are. Ive struggled with my weight my whole life. growing up in the late eighties and then the nineties we were forced fed the food pyramid and the last few days Ive been wondering about trying a meat only diet but didn t have any idea how it would go or how to start. I was planing on looking some stuff up  then I saw you had a video about veganism and then this one. its funny  I d like to think that God worked this out  I found your channel because of your political and entertainment stuff  then I was thinking about my health and diet and then I found you had videos about it too. we ll see how it goes. maybe I can finally start losing weight. go boom.
if you just have one meal a day without carbs you d be surprised how easy it is to stay well below 100g for the day. I started eating only meat for lunch and I noticed several things. I didn t get as sleepy and lazy during the day  I didn t get hungry and need a snack before dinner  and I lost weight.
I struggle with weight gain on and off. I overeat from a life of overworking since my teens. I can attest that putting on extra pounds is a miserable experience. when your pants are tightening and you feel that pinch under your belly button it can be irritating. Ive recently had a long personal talk with myself and have devoted myself to eating better and less. I liked the message in this video. being overweight is hard and it only makes life harder.
I work with 2 guys who were 400 .now one has lost 150lbs and the other has lost 70lbs.  I say good for them thats because they realized the issue with being winded going up 4 stairs as a bad thing. youve got one life  theres no do-overs here. do right by yourself
I will fat shame all over the place. I was obese into my late twenties from the age of eight. when I owned responsibility of it  fat shaming myself  I learned from batman and set my focus on being the best I can be in every aspect of myself. now at the age of thirty  I stay away from processed food and drink  not eating food like peanut butter or cake  my diet mirrors batman s diet plan. working out five to six days a week pushing myself each time  with my diet  I can eat a big meal at breakfast and only get more solid.
I gained quite a bit of weight during the pandemic and  honestly  Ive been looking for a proper solution to getting healthy. what I dont get is how people would give you crap about following a specialty diet that works for you. especially a long-time friend thats supposed to understand you. my guess is its just jealousy  but who knows. some people just need to get over themselves.
absolutely agreed. any and every extreme is bad and damaging for one self. also  I believe the torrid size is the clothes brand... the fact that people are labeling themselves by the size of a brand of clothing is saddening and alarming
I would love to see more video like this if your able or would like to. I generally really like all your videos sense I found you but especially the health ones.
listening to this while eating boudin and crackers for supper    lol.  I will say that genetics do have a lot to it. everyone is going to lose weight and look different in different places. for me  at 5 11   I look best at around 180 - 185 lbs  or so I am told - any lower I get told I am too skinny . I can weigh as much as 205 and barely change a clothes size. most people cant see the weight on me. I am kinda a bigger guy even though I look fairly average  and its not hard to look fit. for me it is losing the stomach fat  which is genetic in my family. I can do sit-ups and crunches for years and never have wash board abs.
I was about to comment how refreshing it is to have found your channel  but then you knocked the poor cleveland browns. we are the down trodden! and you know what Jesus said about that!  p anyways.... love your channel and I will continue to watch even though you are a steelers fan. thank you for standing for your values and being such an awesome voice out there.
these discussions are very helpful.  thank you for talking about this.
when you mentioned  cheese  I thought two things 1  I remember getting somewhat disturbed by the chip  n  dale rescue rangers movie trailer  specifically the part that hints at monterey jack s rehabilitation from his dru- Imean  cheese addiction2  punny joke I heard recently - I know a really good Christian pizza place. wanna come to chees-us   d  d
great nutritional advice you give  melonie!dumb question though  how much butter  in lbs or gms  is a stick of butter equal to  its not a measure Im used to using  lol
I remember reading that it takes 24 inches of fat to stop a 9mm bullet... so maybe they wanna be bullet resistant.
apparently torrid is a clothing brand revolving around extra large women s garments  they just dont use an xl in front of their sizes.  anything sub 1 translates to large or relatively below .speaking for myself  I used to be almost 300 pounds and the highest I ever had to go was xxl. Im not my best form at present  shed more than a quarter of that  but I can definitely do better now that Im back on the horse dieting and adding more exercise   but I cannot comprehend the volume of a human being necessary to justify those sizes. Im aware of some people thatsize  reality television performers and niche fetish streamers   but no person Ive ever known in my life. how far gone do you have to be to get that big if my physically and mentally derelict ass can get in gear  what on earth is happening to some folks
as a personal trainer Ive seen probably 90   of my clients only come in to improve themselves because they were fat shamed
5 mins into the video and I have to comment.  in what universe is this small fat   had me laughing. look I dont put people down because they re fat  but like everyone I think   man  they need to lose some weight.  this world is so upside-down with so many issues. we re to the point where people need to stand up and start calling out all the nonsense thats going on in this world. the problem is that people have gotten too comfortable.
I currently wear an xl because Im a terrible shopper and have a hard time finding shirts that fit comfy around my arms  pants are 34-36 men ofc  depending on the brand. sitting around 240 pounds right now and I know I have more weight to lose  but this fatness spectrum is just sad. my diet usually consists of oatmeal  a ribeye  and 2-3 eggs in the morning  nothing for in the afternoon  then 3 ribeyes and cup of rice for dinner. one of my coworkers 5 years ago told me I would have a heart attack before Im 30 with this diet  but its been working ever since. haven t been to the gym since. only work out I d get is during heavy days of railroad repair and was 280 back then.
over a year ago  I was sick  skinny as a skeleton. Im 6 1 and I weighed 130lbs. I had muscle dysphoria. I got diagnosed with bipolar and I aslo have ulcerative colitis. first  I got help for my mental health which is extremely important for men to do.  I was tired of what I saw in the mirror so I quit drinking  quit eating take out  quit junk foods  stopped smoking weed and tobacco. I now work out five days a week. I only eat healthy home cooked meals. now I weigh 175lbs. I gained it all in muscle mass. Im happy when I look in the mirror now. it wasn t easy  working out is painful and its hard to stay dicaplined. the problem with most people is a lack of discipline and blaming everything but themselves for their health.
I felt very judged about how I like to sit on my couch eating sticks of butter watching goboom videos
dont know if anyone mentions it  but torrid is a clothing store for people who wear bigger sizes and a  00  at torrid is a medium   0  is large  and then 1-6 is just 1x-6x. so I think its about sizes 14-30  I think  and Im referring to it as  bigger sizes  because Im also talking about shoe sizes and women with longer torsos  wider shoulders  things like that. so not necessarily just fat people.
fat acceptance  is nothing more than a big  endless cope from people who have made the decision to abdicate personal responsibility. the audacity of these people to demand respect from me and others when they clearly have absolutely no respect for themselves. galatians 6 5 says  for each one will bear his own load.  indeed  apostle paul  and in more ways than one.
back in the day I was underweight. I have a fast metabolism  or rather I burn through my energy reserves like crazy. but one day I decided I wanted to change  because I wanted to join the military  and in the netherlands  we have a minimum weight requirement. the diet that helped my gain weight was mostly eat allot of beef  everyday all day. gained about 23 pounds in two months  due to the diet and working out about 5 times a week. nowadays Im still  skinny  compared to others  but I am in a much more healthy weightclass  and I eat normally again. there is always a way to improve yourself  unless you have underlying health issues   but you have to be willing to put in the hard work. never ended up in the military thought  due to an accident at my job  which prevented me from working out for over a year  p
I ll admit Imessed up my back years ago and I became lazy for about a year because I couldn t really move around as much   even now there are days where I cant even move my back to bend or anything it practically locks in place now Im pushing 300 pounds Im not proud of it   I know I need help. Ive tried exercising and my back simply refuses to deal with it due to how badly Imessed it up I feel like I dont know what to do at this point I want to make my back a little stronger   lose weight at the same time but it feels like no matter what I do my back just ain t having it.
I was overweight and I cut the carbs out of my diet  I have lost a little more then 50 pounds in 9 months and I feel sooooo good physically  mentally and my confidence has never been higher!
Im so interested in the carnivore diet  I would love to see more videos about how you eat and give tips! I personally dont like eating much meat because I just dont like the taste if any meat but Im willing to try it out
first off  youre doing something right because you look 25 not 35. but youre right. diet  exercise  and sleep are all vital. the older I get and the less active I get the easier it is to gain weight. its tough going from fit to tubby. mentally Imean. like its super easy to get out of shape.also some things can happen physically that can make someone s old routines  use that term loosely I kept my body guessing lol  not feasible. so you have to figure something else out.and people we need to stop eating processed garbage and fast food. certain foods at certain times of day  blah blah... u know what Imean.I like your content but this was a super video. Im gonna look into that protein thing. I saw this just as Im adjusting stuff in my life to make some changes so thanks!!side note... great to see someone who is not ashamed of their faith. yah bless.
people who lived in the far north and had few protein options in the winter would sometimes get protein poisoning because their main source was snow hares  rabbits . now wild rabbits dont have a lot of fat on them they are almost pure muscle so you need to either find some fat somewhere or eat their offal too.  innards. liver  kidney heart  ect ect
if someone left you because of something you said then they were never your friend to begin with. they were basically lying to you all along.
really   your rants! definitely radiates your passion
I changed to a diet consisting entirely of ground beef  steak  eggs  bacon  and hard cheese. Imanaged it for two months and saw my waist shrink almost daily. I shrank six pant sizes in that time frame. I have included some carbs and itstopped shrinking and is beginning to slowly increase. its time to go back to meat and eggs so I can get all the way down to a healthy weight.
Ive always been thin yet I gain weight in muscle. looking at the things I like to eat and the activities I take up itstarts to make sense.
when you said  how is this a thing   it brought to mind computingforever s channel  although since youtube censorship ramped up he s mostly on bit chute -- and thats mostly conspiracy theory stuff  which is better than corporate state news to say the least.
Im very sorry to hear about you losing friends over you voicing your opinions. thatstings a lot  especially when youre doing the right thing  which you are. also  thanks for letting me know I gotta take it easy on the amount of butter sticks Im eating per day. I ll try to keep it down to two from now on.
hello melonie I just wanted wish youto have enjoyable coming weekend.thank you for sharing your passion on sharing Bible scriptures  coursethe interesting topics you bring to life.takecare melonie
great video very informative.. how much protein powder do you mix with the 6 eggs to make waffles  I would love to try that
during my second year at unI  I remember going to a special lecture held by multiple doctors and professors of medicine  one of them interviewed a patient with motor neurone disease  a guy in his 70s or 80s   and it turned out that he was following a vegan lifestyle for years until by the time of his late 40s early 50s - and his doctor at the time advised him to start following a cream-cake diet  or at least include more animal products  in his diet. he has been going on that prescribed diet ever since  to my knowledge.that was almost twenty years ago - just throwing it out there
melonie  when I was a gal I ate 4 dozen eggs every morning to help me get large. now that Ive grown I eat 5 dozen eggs so Im roughly the size of a baaaaaarrrrrge.
speaking of the food pyramid  matpat over on the food theorists did a video about at and the various versions and changes to it over the years.
I tried it  and my parents have been doing it for years. it completely changes your lifestyle. you tend to eat less often  you dont get hungry  and you have a clear head and good energy levels. no more ups and downs due to blood sugar dips and spikes throughout the day.
Im really interested in seeing your nutrition guide.here in europe there is no way I can afford pure carnivore though
I got in shape because my coworker told me I wast starting to get man tits. now I look great! fat shaming does work! lol. dropped 45lb in 3 months on carnivore. looking good and feeling like Im in my 20s again!
yeah there s been a fatness scale for 15 years. it goes big  healthy  husky  fluffy  and damn! it was updated in 2009 to include aw hell naw
gabriel iglesias came up with the  fat spectrum  years ago and its way more accurate  big  healthy  husky  fluffy  daaaaaamn  and oh hell no!
the mac is back!shootin down ideas of rankin  the fatshe on a missionspreadin  the gospel and the truth about nutritiondont be dissin y all dont even knowmelonie on the mic and about to blowfo sho
I would very much enjoy a nutrition episode please!
I was just telling my girl I dont understand food and on the internet I consistently find contradictions  one guy tells me never to eat eggs and another guy tells me its a superfood and I should eat tons  one guy tells me to eat vegetables and another guy tells me that they can kill me. I ll just stay away from processed food I guess.
melonie  your  friend  was not really your friend to begin with.
I was watched your she-hulk content and ended up here. I am on carnivore ketovore diet for almost 5 years now and people start seeing that I look younger than my age. Im 38 now and looks like 25. I am surprised you are 35  you look like 25 too.
taking the first step to weight loss is hard and sometimes you need a kick. but seriously  carnivore works  it cant not work. carbs are 100  the problem.after seeing the  how I did it video  on your other channel  the links and coach mac pdf  I decided to give carnivore a shot back in march. 40lbs gone just like that and Im already at goal  wedding day weight . the gym selfies have been a good kick in the butt on occasion ngl  but seeing results gives you willpower. anyway  what you say works and its great youre pursuing certification.oh and mrs. visitor says thanks
a fellow scorpio  carnivore and gamer.  beef  lamb  eggs and raw dairy for me. easiest shopping list for the past 4 years of my life.
oh dear Lord. I knew what to be expecting from this video but im still in awe listening to it lol. fingers crossed for a less fucked up future.. sigh
the title alone sells its self
I d really love to see these people look at an autopsy of a heavy person. right away you d see why itslowly kills you.
ask melanie a health question and we have an hour video
the irony of being anti-hierarchy while stratifying everything into a little box... in order to place them in a hierarchy  lol.
there is no reason to be fat whatsoever. yes there are certain medical conditions giving you a hard time. I have some of them too. but between normal weight and obesity stage 1 lie like 20 kg depending on your size. its not that hard to stay below obesity stage 1 if you actually care.we have gotten to a point where being overweight is seen as being normal weighted. people stopped recognizing it as being a problem. its become rediculous.
these people need mental help.  creating all these excuses for them to not take accountability for their health.
infinifat is now my favorite word. I burst out laughing when I saw that
dress sizes  I thought the numbers were tons!
pretty sure meat is more expensive in america.the local butcher by me does  20 deal. lasts the week. my croatian mate says you can get a lb of beef for  3.
@noelie noelie  depends where you are in europe.in western europe meat is almost 70  more expensive than what I paid in indiana
@ngc  Im the furthest west you can be in europe. a little island between england and america.ahh yea  absolutely ridiculous prices. Im surprised its not 700  as expensive.
@noelie noelie  I just checked the stores I used to go to in indiana  -10  for chicken  -30  for ground beef
oh God I remember this whaleness label list lol infinifat is basically 600  pounds lmao.
your just jealous of my overwhelming physique  beefcake!!!!!!
people always find a way to shame people for no damn reason... I really hate it mel...
Im short - fat . 5 foot 6 and 267 pounds . been doing carnivore for about 2 weeks . will try to limit my cheese intake .
I am very overweight. I will try your beef and egg thing. I ll get back to you in a month to see what kind of progress I see
does each level have a flag. like sandwich to burger to pizza and the last one is a buffet flag
melonie  torrid is a chain clothing store for heavily overweight   obese women. you see it in some shopping malls.
wow if thats small fat then Im fit as a fiddle .granted Im 38 on the bmI scale  I know muscle issue but still good indicator
thats why Im on the ketogenic diet  and I also eat pretty much what you eat
you can have excuses  or you can have results. choose.
youre great melonie
chart should read  small fat - dead by 80    mid fat - dead by 70   superfat - dead by 60   infinifat - dead by 45
well coming from a husky farm boy  mid fat  is where me myself and I are standing at.
its ridiculous. this has gotten so much worse than when we were kids! literally 10 s of thousands of peer-reviewed papers showing a marked increase in heart disease  cancers  high blood pressure  diabetes  and dozens of other health problems directly linked back to obesity. it is not  healthy  as some might think. instead of just letting them do that  a little tough love can go a long way towards helping a person live a happy  healthier life. as long as we approach it in a respectful way of course.
lol I have to wear 1x in most shirts just to make my shoulders fit guess im a fat now
this madness can be summed up as  Im too lazy and selfish to better myself so my unhealthy choices must be deemed as perfectly healthy and attractive. its the same thing as participation trophies. too lazy to shoot for  1 so just say everyone wins.
what s hilarious is being fat is literally self inflicted. melonie knows this  because she does the carnivore keto thing  which is a rabbit hole that will absolutely annihilate any trust you may still have in mainstream health advice.
shirt size doesnt determine fatness. I have a friend who s skinny but wears a 4xl because of his height. these people are in denial of science and reality
its kind of funny that we are now at a point people are claiming better status for being fatter than someone else.
so maybe a small fat  is like avocado fat  which in turn gets decked by bacon. got it!
hyyyype! cant wait to hear back. you may need to get an electrolyte drink supplement  make sure its low carb though  at first because keto is a diuretic  and with excess water being flushed some get imbalanced with electrolytes at first while their body adapts. the electrolyte drinks help with that    I also suggest doing some research on the carnivore diet  watch dr ken berry s keto  carnivore videos  or maybe look into the world carnivore tribe group for inspiration and so you ll know what to expect with adaptation.you got this  Im so excited for you!
its kinda worse than that. its a claim that losing is somehow superior  and a desire or respect for winning is a character flaw.
soon enough these people will start saying they re proud to be fat....
great commentary!
I had to laugh a litte at the verse of the day.    . . .gluttonous eaters of meat.   ironic.  no hate from me.  keep booming!
as a fellow fat person you just got to eat less put the fork down do any kind of physical activity clean the house mow the lawn take a walk my biggest problem is that Ive been yo-yo dieting if you want to know how to lose weight this guy on youtube greg doucette great coach has a lot of good info you guys can do it
infinifat has to be a joke right  thats hilarious. itsounds like diabeto s final form or something.
Im distressed to be a  mid-fat . I need to lose weight.
just waiting for the vegan video!! that will rock!!
am just thinking  why not also create a channel devoted to fitness  that might put too much on your plate though  no pun intended   as you have a gaming channel and this one aside from twitch as well.
my problem is I have  2  and there s a 5pack of ramen or a single can of tuna.that can wont last five days.
I ll be honest being fat is not good Im fat and there s a lot of problems you will have physically and mentally but after doing low carb diet I feel so mich better Im more confident how I look and Im not stress as much as I did back in the day
torrid scale is the fitsizes at a store called torrid which is a fat fashion store
being fatphobic for yourself is actually important
do you have any source study material for your diet and nutrition  or do you have a separate channel for diet and nutrition
at some point the clothing options become tarp or car cover.
saying I have a phobia means nothing  one is allowed to have irrational fears. its a free country.
I wanna try the dino diet.
everyone has nutrition opinions  when I went keto carnivore I had people express genuine concern for my wellbeing. same people were fine if I drank a six pack and ate pizza
as someone who is fat and trying  and frankly failing  to get better  I hate seeing this junk. it isn t helping anyone and is likely to cause more health problems. also  if they put as much effort as being proud of being fat into trying to not be fat  the wouldn t be fat. for the record  yes I tried keto  but I just couldn t keep it up.
thanks im getting joke ideas for twitter and I already meme d this
the  fat camp  has been trying to rake in as many victim points are they can  but fortunately most people agree on extreme fat being a health issue  and not something thatshould be celebrated nor encouraged. no  hillary  the only thing oppressing you is gravity.thatsaid  I cant just let it pass that  infinifat  is extremely ironic of a label. like bro  the memes are becoming reality once again
I dont know Ive always been skinny Im still am skinny I went on I cant tell you how many weight gaining diets. trust me my metabolism is that fast
I d like to do that if I can manage the upkeep haha
I share a lot on my instagram story highlights  and dr ken d berry on youtube as well as steak and butter gal are amazing resources  d
hey brother - hope youre getting enough sleep and getting that circadian rhythm just right.. slowly replacing your diet with healthier bites - one day at the time  becoming a better version of yourself  even if that means an eviler-mandraker - just wanna say I believe you can do it - stay safe out there !
@unmuted tab  thanks. its a simple thing  but I appreciate it.
fat is unhealthy  I am 125 kg. myself   down from 136kg.  but stay 125 for years    but shaming fat people to feel bad not always motivate them to loss weight but many time stress them off into dark mental place.
while gluttony may be a sin keep this in mind...never trust a thin chef.
those bigots did not include  fluffy  on the spectrum smh
also  eggs are amazing!
simple  obese means being overweight.  dont let progs tell you otherwise
who would have thought lgbtqia2 actually stood for ldl  gastritis  bbw  triglyceride   yas  queen  infinifat  acid reflux and  needs  2-seats.I really think infinifat needs to be the term for when someone is more than morbidly obese though  itsounds like the final form of fatness... like in an anime about obesity  the villain s ultimate form would be to go infinifat and he d grow to mountain size  cause earthquakes with each strained heartbeat and level villages with each heavy breath expanding his sides outward many miles. imagine his power when he can get the energy to move.
remember when  phobia  meant having a fear of something  now  if there supposed hate for something  it is considered having a phobia. fatphobia is not the fear of fat people. transphobia is not the fear of trans people. society needs to stop inventing words.
sure  super fat and infinifat sounds better than  dying alone .
ok melonie  Im gonna stop you right there with the metabolism talk not even 4 minutes in. what youre saying might apply to a huge majority of people who claim they have a fast one  but it doesnt apply to everyone. I am your age and Im on the skinny side of the spectrum  my weight hasn t fluctuated more than a couple of pounds since middle school. my younger brother is a little heavier by maybe 10 lbs but he s the same way. both my mother   father s side has been the same too  though my dad s gut turned into a basketball at some point later in life but he s not  fat  in the jabba the hutt sense  like the rest of his body s normal.Imight not eat the most nutritious stuff a lot of the time  but I can basically eat whatever I want   not put on pounds  and I do occasionally get some bangin  home cooked meals. I have been high as balls and had like  30 in fast food to myself in the past  no difference. and I used to smoke a lot in my 20s-early 30s to help with my really small appetite  but haven t touched it in about a year. I also drink like a fish  no beer belly for me. meanwhile I see friends of mine my age getting those dad bods.in my case I think I also have a hyper thyroid thing going on in conjunction with my metabolism. in any event Ive been perpetually about the same weight for the past 20 years no matter what I ingest. its kinda nice since I dont have to worry about it like some people would if they ate a certain thing.I am the embodiment of contradiction to your bob jerome argument  5 9   maybe 135  sit on my ass all day  eat drink whatever I want. Imight not be shredded since I dont exercise  but Im not fat either.
you need a gaming channel in which you play  really
people use the term phobia way too broadly.  I dont see many humans walking around with an irrational fear of fat people.  admitting something is unhealthy  or even going so far as to pass a moral judgement based on it  is not the same as having an irrational fear.  saying put down the pie fatty is mean but it is not fearful for example.
melonie is awesome! this is 100  a fact. no opinion.
I about stroked out when I saw  infinifat  in the list. seriously  my brain just shut off for a bit.
obese young people need to know that as you age  there will be serious health issues. my perspective is to be the best you can be   spiritually  mentally  and yes  physically.
I really need to loose weight. Im 5 6 or 5 7  I was 226 lbs  I dropped down to 222 lbs. Im trying to loose enough to wear medium shirts.
the spiking of insulin is a huge contributor to fat accumulation. fat itself doesnt spike insulin at all basically  and protein does so moderately. complex carbs like grains  sugars  fruits and highly processed snack foods spikes insulin massively and thats where a huge problem for fat individuals exists. thats why keto works so well for fat loss  and combining that with intermittent fasting works even better.
this is why fat shaming is both virtuous and necessary.I got fat shamed by a sushI chef in japan. it was a watershed moment in my life and started my journey from 6 3  and 260 lbs to 220 lbs
I beat anorexia. unfortunately I also look like I  ate  anorexia as well.
I wont criticize people for being fat  if someone s fat because they value that pizza more than their long-term health  thats their choice. but Im not going to give someone special privileges of any kind for being overweight.
isn t keto really hard on your kidneys
I dont disagree  I literally said in my video I was referring to the vast majority and not the extremely rare exceptions with conditions lol. but even so  unless you have an actual health condition  if you are underweight you could fix it with nutrition regarding not only how much you eat but what you are eating as well. people think they eat more or less than they actually do when they are only eating intuitively and not actually tracking their nutrtition
@melonie mac go boom  fair response  I did pick up on that but it was a bit later into the video that you clarified it iirc  in terms of fast metabolism. I know you did mention that regarding being overweight earlier into the vid.I do not track my nutrition  Im happy with my size as is. would I like to get ripped  sure  who wouldn t. if I were to get serious about it I d probably pull some semi-carnivore diet stuff like you are and track it  but I couldn t give up like potatoes and certain vegetables.my family s eastern european  so Ive mostly had experience with traditional foods of that variety. a lot of sausage  heavy stews  schnitzel  etc.I did also mention that I have a really small appetite  except for when I got super baked   possibly have a thyroid thing going on  and family history of metabolisms on both sides. its a combination of multiple factors in my case. it isn t entirely fair to say the metabolism point can be course corrected for 99  of people  maybe its better to say for like 80-85  of people.
Ive been saying this exact thing.
oh boy this is a complex subject. obesity is most often a result of a massive dietary imbalance. the energy consumed needs to far out weigh the energy used  through both activity and metabolism   and this needs to happen consistently day after day for months or even years. the factors and causes are complex and range from the biological to the psychological. most often its a result of a lack of impulse control where the desire for instant gratification from food outweighs health conerns. yes depression can often play a huge part where an individual craves gratification of any kind and food is an easy instant hit  but there is a price for anything in life. beauty standards are extremely relative but most often they are skewed to body types that are rare or difficult to attain for many  because scarcity   value . also they are skewed towards markers that indicate fertility and good health. this isn t right or wrong  it just seems to be the order of things among virtually every biological eco-system. obesity isn t a marker for either fertility or good health. unfortunately as the population becomes more sedentary the massive imbalance of energy consumed vs energy used just gets worse over time. obestiy for most is not a forgone conclusion  it was reversable at any point of the years it took to achieve. now as more and more of the population becomes obese its got to a point where its normalized and looked upon as the natural way of things  but its not. advocates for obestiy even start to champion it. they vilify friends or people who are well known for ebracing health and for shedding excess bodyfat through good diet and exercise. they are abused for embracing a healthy lifestyle because it makes others feel self conscious by comparison. its madness. look its vital that people feel good about themselves but there s a huge compnent of self delusion in all of this. the pure truth is that if you are obese your health will suffer  your quality of life will be far diminished and you will  on average  live a far shorter life. let s be specific. having a higher bodyfat percentage than someone else is not unhealthy  its normal or even desirable  in females especially . but now we are in a situation where obesity  to the point that fat forms rolls in the skin  is being pushed as a positive. obese  sometimes even morbidly obese  lingerie models are placed beside trim and fit models in advertising campaigns with the implication that this is what you should be aiming for. it is a terrible message. our parents and grand-parents didn t have such issues because they lived in a time when work tended to be more labour intensive and eating to excess was seen as wasteful  and unaffordable . this is just an odd time when the positive messages of feeling good about yourself  which is wonderful  get expanded to include negative and health damaging body types. I watched a fashion show a couple of weeks back where obese models were paraded in lingerie. the comments beneath were almost all  finally models that look like me. I feel much better now.  look live your best life and all that but if you are in the states in particular make sure your health insurance is up to date. start researching information about type 2 diabetes becuase its going to be a big part of your future if that is the path you wish to keep walking.
mel  cats are obligate carnivores  dogs are carnivores but can consume some some plant based foods  we humans are omnivores.
its all about our brain. that organ just want to feel good that is why we love food like pizza  burgers  cheese  chocolate  etc. if we d eat plain but healthy food our brain just doesnt want more of it
oh man please take us back to the nineties when labels weren t  cool . its like everyone wants to be some kind of special label because they think thats where their worth comes from. fat is not a spectrum  thats an excuse used by people who refuse to improve their health. I would say I am fatphobic in that I legitimately do not want to get fat. thats not to say I dont like fat people  except the ones that make fun of people for wanting to get fit. going to the gym  building muscle and getting fit is one of the best decisions Ive ever made.
small fan - played tomb raider maybe 2 times.infinifan - has life size statue of lara croft.why are the small fans speaking over the infinifans
bit of a history lesson concerning veganism. the chinese  when invaded by the huns  were wiped out easily because most of them lived on a plant based diet  where as for the huns  meat was a common thing they ate  which meant they were both taller and stronger as a result. kind of makes you wonder why the government is so desperate to get its citizens to adopt veganism so badly...that and the more testosterone you have the more likely your going to vote republican if your a centrist.
a pound of 70  lean and 30  fat of ground beef has 65g of protein.  I thought your body at most can absorb 35g of protein at a time   then you have to wait about three hours before you can absorb more protein
I recently found out that most mens pants now are shorter then advertised and are cut for women.walmart sells xxl as l and xl as m.
as an obese person  I can say that I understand the reason why the whole fatphobia thing is being pushed  everyone always focuses on your weight  they immediately judge the extra pounds and assume thats everything they need to know about a person  they assume laziness when in fact you tire out quickly from carrying hundreds of extra ponds on you everywhere  they assume a big appetite  your fat because you dont know how to stop eating  while that can be true  obesity is also a symptom of poor nutrition  you go to a doctor for a cough and they immediately bring up the extra weight  you dont like yourself for being fat and everyone everywhere is always commenting on it and always makes the same assumptions about your weight  that your a lazy person that likes to eat  so I really understand the push to normalize being fat  its because we are tired of always being told we are the problem and its solely our fault we are fat  I honestly want to lose the weight  but I dont need people constantly saying  put down the burger and go on a run  like thats all there is to it  instead I want someone to reach out their hand  come  let me help you figure out what you need
just look at what they care about... which brands canthey purchase. thatshould tell you all you need to know.
I can and I did get fat on beef and eggs. its calories in calories out
aggretsuko fitness trainer  protein!
uhh... that bit near the beginning talking about skinny people eating whatever they want  that is me.
I gonna start cutting carbs - ok !
youre 35 !! wow you look 25 congratulations
go boom!!!!!
a little shaming wouldn t hurt this society right about now. truth hurts only when youre living lies.
that chart is not very accurate as it doesnt take height into factor. I have a 36 waist but Im 6 5  and Im far from fat
lol @ infinifat. sounds like a dbz final form
Im zero fat!
I said herbivore but meant omnivore  I figured most would get that being as how I explained it lol
I ll answer this in my video tomorrow
@melonie mac go boom  thanks. btw  instagram now requires a sign-in to just look at stuff. sometimes  but rarely  it doesnt ask.
well youre not eating nearly as bad or as much as you think if youre skinny in comparison to those who are not. people aren t born with magic metabolisms  there is not that drastic of a difference in that regard.
@melonie mac go boom  well  at one point I was eating about 3500 calories a day. does that count   p
resume the boom!
mel-hulk smash!
dang girl  39 minutes ! are you mad
its what comes out of man that defiles him.we can eat what we want espescially well you know lol.
I just dont want to eat butter.
the metabolism arguement drives me absolutely nuts. Im sorry but your body does not violate the laws of physics. thermodynamics tells us that if you burn more calories than you consume you will lose weight
theres no waythat woman is a 2xl im a 2xl and im like 70-80 kilos like that woman is twice my size and she s wearing the same size clothes I do    im a man though
I liked gabriel iglesias  scale better  big healthyhuskyfluffydamn!!!! and oh hell no!!!!!
where would someone on a budget even get so much meat  color me ignorant  but itseems to me that the meat section at the grocery store is much more expensive than the processed stuff.
pure self indulgence
... glutenes eaters of meat... awequard pause  .  thought that was funny   but yeah  seriously get what your saying I am adicted to biltong  and man I just eat until I feel sick   not a great look.
I hope you dont mind me saying that you look great.  I will try to go carnivore diet
frankie go boom
imagine if they started doing this for races  youre pale black. dont speak for the superblacks!
sure is... Im solidly on the  damn!  side of the spectrum.and I dont give a damn if youre  fat phobic.   if you aren t antagonizing others. being fat is not healthy.  Im a very fat man. I know this  its okay to not like it.
social fat spectrum I always thought obesity was measured on a scale.

boom!!!
do u take supplements then melo
your always looking so pretty
youre 35!  no way
exactly
I think the issue is more that on a chemical level that their bodies aren t registering as full at caloric levels that would do so in a healthy person  so they struggle much harder to stop eating.  it takes a lot of willpower to overcome nature and the weight ends up spiraling out of control.  just because you know you need to eat less  for many that is not enough to correct the problem- people are irrational and do what they feel.  I d akin an obese person losing weight to an addict quitting smoking.  they know they should  but it cantake an extraordinary effort of will.
I do agree  though   that we shouldn t lie to these people and tell them they re healthy and there s nothing they can do  they need honesty to empower them to fight the weight battle.
wall-e
do you know allanah perce or trisha hershburger by any chance
unhealthy is the new fab... obesity is ok I hate this timeline
what in the hell
what kind of eggs do you need to eat
are those just women sizes
actually protein can be converted to glucose
infinifat.... yeah..... lolz
anti--nutrients...should I quit drinking coffee   I bet that is anti-nutritous.
wow  I didnt know this crap existed.
when your so big that you have to perform what one woman calls poop yoga whenever she uses a public restroom  or your so big that you cant even wash  bathe  or clothes yourself  and you need someone else to do it  this can only be done because someone is enabling you. get rid of the enabler and the problem fixes itself. also  watched one such guy  and the woman was complete garbage to him  and he finally left  yet she s the victim for constantly craping on the only person willing to help her.you dont have to be a member of mgtow to understand this...have some self-respect guys. a child cant spoil itself  and these women can only treat you the way they do because you keep enabling them. islam doesnt have this problem  and for a good reason  so take note of what their doing  just be careful not to go as far as they do  because Im telling you now...if men thought like women things would be better...for the men. for the women they would think the religion of driving trucks of peace down a busy sidewalk would be a matriarchy.
your new hair needs to stop sexually harassing me. meme aside as a fat guy we need to stop being fat as a country  Im  keeping my kids healthy and active  and Im working to fix my weight 3 miles a day. you dont have to be superman tomorrow just better than who you were yesterday.
ehm we are omnivores  not herbivores !
holy shit ur 35
hey melonie I just want to tell you and say that being fat and unhealthy is not good for you and your health at all bc it will make your life not easy and make yourself feel tired alot every day and not want to do so much in your activities and so being unhealthy and fat is not good for you and your health and as you get older that you will get start using a cane to use to walk with if you dont stay healthy and eat healthy foods and stay healthy and fit  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and just want to see if you agree with me on my comment on this topic of this video  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
reminds me of some of the losers  I used to think they were cool  thatstopped being my friend because I voted for trump.
Ive never once in my life insulted a fat person or made any comment about weight. to me  thatseems impossibly rude. but...I cant relate to fat people  as Im unable to comprehend that mindset. you have one life. to live that life as an obese person is unthinkable to me.  Ive known quite a few obese people  and they all have one thing in common. they eat enormous amounts of food. its not complicated. I hung out with a girl who was just  chubby  once. not obese  just overweight.  she bought a box of small eclairs and proceeded to eat all six at once. I thought to myself  my God  Ive never done something like that...ever. and it dawned on me that these people are doing  every day  what many people have never done once in their lives. its a lack of self control  and often quite a bit of arrogance mixed in. Imean  you have to be pretty arrogant to not worry about being obese and still think people will find you attractive and worthy of respect.
torrid is a clothing store thatspecializes in clothes for  oversize woman talk about double standards  they dont want us putting labels on people  but then turn around and make more labels.
id rather be fat than be a heroin junky   I know because ive been both in the past
5 8  former fat guy here. Ive reduced from 350 lbs to 165 and kept it off. calories are all that matter! plz stop demonizing carbs  are you joe rogan or something lol. also  carnivore has unknown long term effects. ps I eat  200g carbs every day
like scrambled or raw or
doesnt make much of a difference either way  but I do advice cooking them because egg white proteins are better absorbed cooked. other than that the way you cook an egg does not make a difference in nutritional content unless you are adding something to them.
I already said that in this video  both fat and protein can be converted to glucose on an at-need basis through gluconeogenesis. if you watched the full video you would have heard that part lol
coffee is acidic and it causes dehydration and fatigue. but I do love me a cup of colombian in the morning.
thats what Imeant  my bad
omg. this is going too far. had long ago  actually. try to be healthy people!
well  looks like Im 1st. so its my turn to say something for once   post some comments
nope
im unapologeticly fatphobic... I like women with abs   sorrynotsorry
dogs are now herbivores  for decades they were on the carnivore list. this is a real question  not me being an ass.
ususally  gym  rats  or  skinny people  fat  shame people...btw  does sound like fat  shaming  coming  from you but thats   on you
melonie  your personal health opinions and decisions are extremely oppressive.  everyone is already perfect the way they are.....how dare you suggest we need to actually seek self-improvement.  we welcome being a burden on the health system....we are entitled to special treatment  just like our parents and grandparents who smoked 3 packs a day.
100 grams of carbs a day ..  not everyone is a 130 lb female thats quite cookie cutter. Im a 210lb male with 15  bodyfat I can afford to eat more carbs. if youre gonna give nutrition advice be a bit more holistic in the way you look at your approach to the over all population. also yes carbs and glycogen do help build muscle there are mountains of studies to back this up. when I went low carb where I was eating like 150 grams of carbs a day sure I lost a shit ton of weight  but my strength was shit. where I was easily squatting 315 for 10 reps when I cut down my carbs I could barley get up 285 for 1 rep. Im not dogging carnivore or keto either. if it works for you fuckin  a girl ..but I feel like youre falling into a similar dogmatic pitfall of diet that vegans do where it becomes a team sport  an us vs them type of thing.
you can be   healthy  or  unhealthy  and we all still gonna die one day. just live your best life  whatever makes you happy the most. all youre gonna do is live a couple more years when youre 80. so will it even matter then
I ll ask again. why did u block me from ig and twitter  I thought u were a free speech warrior   I swear  you conservatives cry all day about how you are supposedly being censored but the moment somebody says anything that hurts your feelings  the first thing you try to do is cancel them
yeah same here! being fat is not only unhealthy but its also really unattractive
Imeant omnivore but accidentally said herbivore
@melonie mac go boom  ok...I was wondering if things changed for the feline and canine species. thank you.
if you actually watched the video and listened to what I said you d see I was giving advice to people on how to not be fat. you aren t fat.
@melonie mac go boom  which is fine but give people a range  100 grams is not the right amount for everyone. when I was 290lbs I lost 45lbs in 6 weeks cutting out carbs but hit a plateau for 6 months because of it.  I had no energy I was doing more cardio than I am now but my rpm watts were in the gutter. a lot of the weight lost was muscle  it wasn t sustainable. once I reintroduced a healthy amount of carbs I started losing weight again. like I said I feel like if you going to give weight loss advice be understanding that not everyone is your size.
cant wait to address this comment in my next video because loooooollll if you actually think this
look up the hunza people  or the hunza diet. you will be surprised. also  look up monsanto corporation. put two and two together.
@melonie mac go boom  its true though. what s your definition of healthy  Ive seen people that are 400  pounds. or even people that literally cant even get outta bed from being overweight. if Im 20-30 pounds overweight  is that what you consider unhealthy ! ! as to my first comment  if Im 70 years old  Im not too concerned with living a extra 10-20 years. Ive had a good run!
take a second to ask yourself slowly if blocking someone is even remotely the same as cancelling or antI free speech in any way  because that is an embarrassingly ignorant take lol
