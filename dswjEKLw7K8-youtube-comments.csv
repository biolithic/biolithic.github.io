nebula was more girly in the first guardians  even her walk  but from the second movie onwards  james gunn gave her more layers of clothing and had her steadily taking on more masculine mannerisms. like many things that have been in the mcu for some time  it was fine for a bit  barely noticeable  until it got revealed the real reason why. it s all part of the social conditioning being orchestrated by the powerful  who insanely don t think they have enough power already.our entertainment is now to be in our own hands  at our own hands. we make the new franchises  and refuse to let the powerful ever touch them. it s the only way to save humanity.
this literally was the last marvel movie i actually thought i might go to the theater for... oh well... way to go disney
glad to see you making you re having fun making your usual content again  hope you re doing well!
another thing that floors me is her character in what if. without thanos  abuse  nebula became more feminine and it was obvious that given a choice she would be more feminine  more of a women than murder robot.    i thought her overall character progression was one of the best in the mcu and i was looking forward to seeing more of that in live action since karen gillian is such a great actor. she was lowkey one of my favorite characters of the whole universe
they ll probably go the  commit to the machine thanos made me route   which reverses her character development. honestly i d prefer if they went the opposite route and allowed her to develop a motherly instinct in helping people  particularly children from tyrants like thanos. she travels with the guardians in order to help who she can how she can  but she fights her hardest when children are involved
i ve seen arguments about how the original nebula character poster was photoshopped to make her looking more appealing  which is true  but that just shows that they gave her a dad bod on the new poster to be less appealing  because we know she doesn t look like that.
yep you re completely spot on  they ve been feminising men and masculinising females for a while now and its becoming more and more blatantly obvious every day.  it s not just looks either  but in their actions and words too. feminism and the  trans community  has been extremely destructive in nature to femininity and woman as a whole  as a consequence men have suffered because of it too. honestly the term  feminism   is basically misnomer  since its negatively affected both genders significantly  its very subversive in nature. good intentions pave the road to hell  as they say.
keep fighting the good fight  mel. we re with you.
okay  now we know why nebula was included in the guardians. it made no sense when they d ditched the tough gamora in favor of the cute mantis. but nebula is a cyborg so they can change her body to push the transvestite agenda.
i just went back and watched the trailers again. the scene where nebula is carrying quill her legs look quite beefy  especially compared to mantis  legs. there aren t scenes where she looks particularly feminine. my new theory is that the person who quill is upset about dying injured is nebula and she survives by getting a new body.
just so you know  tying this all to the biblical truth not only didn t scare me away  but it earned you another subscriber. you re not afraid to call out the truth even in the face of appearing unpopular or opening yourself up to ridicule by closed-minded people. i think that s incredibly based.
if you look at the first teaser poster  the characters are really small  but there are high resolution copies out there   nebula is clearly actual nebula  a completely different person compared to the new person. you re 100  correct  they clearly took nebula s head and put it on a man s body... for some reason.
let me guess... in the film  nebula is going to decide  she  is now a  he . comedy will ensue  followed by an ideological  lesson  we ll be subject to. can t wait to find out...
wokeism is satanism . wise words. your video breaking it down is eye opening and i share it when i can. keep kicking ass  mac!
there s nothing wrong with having androgynous characters  but it s a problem when everyone else is turned androgynous and not in a good way.
that was literally some of the best 14 46 minutes ive spent on a long time via a youtube video.. what a breath of fresh air during these times of high level preprogramming. bless you
karen gillian  as nebula    watch me take what society would think as ugly  android  and make it beautiful! disney studios   watch us take what society would think as beautiful  actress  and make it ugly!
nebula is awesome as she was. hope they don t mess her up in part 3.
brittany was right  melonie is like a ray of sunshine  and you cant help but like her and want to protect her. those of us who are far away  and not terribly financially well off  can only offer our hopes and prayers that all will be well  but we will continue to do so. its good to see she already seem in better spirits. we all love ya  melonie.
it s not just nebula. look at black widow in iron man 2  avengers 1  and captain america winter soldier compared to black widow in infinity war and endgame. look at captain marvel... she s just rectangle shaped in the movies. the actress that plays captain marvel is not that rectangular shaped. the mcu its androgynizing a lot of the female heroes that you d expect to look hot. and it really sucks because why can t we have those ideal female body heroes on screen to see  it s not like they made thor  captain america or iron man start covering up. they have shirtless scenes in every movie they re in because they re hot  and because they want to show how fit those heroes are. so why can t the women be super fit and feminine too
she was even more girly in the comics.
theyre not powerful. youre more powerful.
@alex burch  in this world ruled by money... they are......
@caliginous moira  stop going to their movies.  stop buying their video games.  in this world ruled by money  you are more powerful.
@scott walde  that is is a given movies  games  i still have to pay bills taxes...and for land that somehow someone magically owns....
@caliginous moira  nah they aren t. in entertainment  they re only as powerful as the customers are thirsty for content. no customers  no money  no power.
@caliginous moira   power comes out of the barrel of a gun. . mao zhe dong
karen probably intimidated them so they went with it.
@caliginous moira   in this world ruled by money but where do they get their money from from you  from us  from the consumer. if they consumer wants something to change it s as simple as not giving them your money for a long enough time.
ditto.  they just lost my family s tickets.  why   i have teenage daughters to be proud of being women.  i will not subject them to this.  not dad bod nebula.
same
after wasting hours of my life   my money on thor dud and thunder i never want to see any new mcu movies or tv. go woke go to hell!
@neil davis  save your money bro check out nebula in the  what if series she s even more feminine they downplayed her femininity for the movies anyway
like why was nebula you re fav character  bruh you re going to watch it
@deska diaz  woosh
all this over one character  if it bothers you that much ignore it and enjoy the rest of the movie.
@kyle williams  the more money we give these people the more they re going to think that they can continue to do this shit
@kyle williams  yeah... she s a maim character in this  not some random mob on the street in the background.
a bit dramatic  but i agree with the sentiment
you guys sound like grown babies
@francisco hidalgo  it has to get bigger to the point that all of the audience aren t giving them money then and only then will they change
the greedy always want more ...its in the name   the fact they are allowed to is the problem aint it .
james gunn is good at making superhero movies but christ he s so woke for no reason
amen to that
that s why i m on youtube. the standard entertainment media options are anti mentally stable so i go in here and watch stuff i actually want to see
it s the only way to save humanity  please be serious.
glad to see someone say we make our own entertainment.  i m personally doing what i can on that front. hope it works out so people can have something to love again.
@thegravityshifter  the ultimate recourse would be to just get rid of all of our digital cable subscription boxes. no boxes equals no money for multiple companies because reruns of old movies or tv shows or even showings of new things will never rake in any new money because nobody will be watching anything. we would still be able to use our digital tvs coupled with whatever streaming subscriptions we would want. mainly we have to pick the lesser of all evils. if you do that and limit your use of the internet then you would only find what you want to find and at the end of the day they wouldn t make as much money or any if they really wanted to. desperate times  desperate struggles  call for desperate measures.
@thunderofdarkcloud  it s a lot of sacrificing for sure. but i don t think you d really have to do all of that to get your point across if it s just one show or movie.spongebob squarepants dominates nickelodeon because it s popular and the other shows aren t as popular. the moment you tune away from that channel  the viewer count drops and that means less money. this usually results in the show getting cancelled or not air as much as another show on the same channel.the only way what you re saying would apply is if you just want to do away with all of it at once. not only is that unrealistic but it s not necessary. that s like defecting from gaming entirely because you want to hurt ea and activision or something.i m not much of an expert on this stuff. i m just basing this on evidence and what usually causes a cancellation or less frequent airing.
@thegravityshifter  that stuff used to work until access media got some backing from some secret brokers. the velma show shouldn t be getting a second season at all because it didn t get the kind of use that would qualify to get it but they greenlit the next season regardless of that fact. also sorry to say but from where i ve been sitting there is evidence of many more tv shows that are truly damaging to children and the human psyche  in other words there s a lot more bad things than good at the moment  so a purge seems necessary.i realize it s very unrealistic but that s just because they know that they have people hooked. still it is the one option that would actually get the point fully across. i would be amazed if anyone actually went through with this suggestion.no offense to anyone who is a fan of spongebob but i never really was even when i was a kid. i found him very annoying lol. if the majority out there like him i don t have a problem with that however if it s been on for as long as you say then sooner or later it ll possibly end up in a similar situation as family guy or the simpsons winter still getting viewers even though in all honesty those two shows should just go away now.yes i do realize it would suck if the show gets cancelled because of such a radical notion for those who do love it but perhaps the benefit outweighs the need for something like that. children will actually spend more time outside playing and socializing. just things to consider that s all i m saying. who knows what the future will bring.
guys just go to media not affected by these idiots yet  anime  vox machina  just stuff made by small people and groups that are still pretty decent.
@thegravityshifter  well we can all agree that things need to change.
@thunderofdarkcloud  yes
@janterra  been doing that somewhat.
well  she was a model. she had a strut about her. and we liked it. i didn t bother paying to pay to see the second movie. and now i certainly won t bother paying to see the third. marvel is going straight down the toilet. screw em. they wanna tank  let s let them until they come crawling back.
more layers of clothing is a good thing but you re right
@peepeepoopoo studios  depends on the reasoning with that too. it s one thing to make yourself publicly decent but it shouldn t be in a way where it comes off like you re ashamed of your body. and depending on what your beliefs are  there needs to be a fine balance between provoking lust  intentionally or not  and embracing our beauty. in my beliefs  we are fearfully and wonderfully made and it should not be ashamed of.
@revenant ronin  her character doesn t change simply because she has a flat chest.
@kyle williams  elaborate.
@revenant ronin  what is there to elaborate. the movie isn t ruined simply because of a design change.
its been over. let go
@kyle williams  bro youre a bot
@the grove  how am i a bot for having a different opinion
@kyle williams  the issue is you can t ignore it anymore because it s every where  and not only do most people find it silly  seriously don t agree  or are indifferent to it. we all can agree that it s making movies and shows worse   you can tell by the ratings for recent media vs older media   so if we keep ignoring this it ll just get worse  i know because it already has.
@kyle williams  you shouldn t have to constantly ignore things though just to enjoy a movie. if you are keep putting stuff off are you even enjoying it anymore   that s what i have to say about the movie part. but the whole making women more masculine and men for feminine is a recipe for disaster. because masculinity was made for men and femininity for women. men can be monsters  so having masculine traits like. self control   to keep your self in line    strength and leader ship   to keep other people in line   are great things. the more men that stray away from being masculine  the less self control you have  so your more open to doing bad things  if your not strong you can t defend yourself or other people. and without leadership there s is anarchy  basically no control so everyone does what they want  usually people doing bad things  now for women being feminine is beauty  being reserved and compassion .the more reserved you are you hold yourself to a high standard and it keeps you off the radar if someone were to try something  being compassionate helps in social settings and for taking care of people on a emotional level  and beauty is a sign of fertility  and a sign of power. to show that your better looking than someone makes you of a higher caliber or quality a sign of status  kind of like money for a man. men can never be as beautiful as women and  women will never be as strong as men. holding each other to standards that aren t meant for us makes the standard hard to obtain or caricature of what it s supposed to be. now a woman can have masculine features and and feminine for men  but it should never overshadow masculinity in men and femininity in women. as a woman fighter in movies it s important to at least show that she s feminine and strong. it s what stops it from basically being two n ggas fighting.
i stopped supporting disney after endgame
@jason whitley  ok you make great points and you speak facts
@nochrist _ nolife  wise choice my friend
@nochrist _ nolife  i try watching enteral s and shang chi and absolutely hated it especially doctor strange 2
@nochrist _ nolife  i lost my fate with marvel and like why can marvel be great can  blame disney for that lol
i haven t watched any marvel movies since no way home  it s been the only somewhat good marvel movie in the last few years i ve watched and enjoyed. disney s definitely chucking the mcu straight to the gutters
@marcy  for real
sounds like a you problem
thank you so much  all of y alls kind words have helped me tremendously
@a. ruiz  i don t think the her arc should be as overt as a child being forcibly altered by a doctor-villain type  however i think that her arc should include overcoming a sort of repulsion of herself. she sees herself as a machine  a monster created by thanos  she s twisted and unnatural and resembles nothing of what she once was. i think it would make for a great scene if she met someone  probably a child who wasn t immediately afraid of her  and it allows her to realize she can be a reassurance to people  that not everyone sees her as a danger or a threat  that she can make a positive difference to people s lives.
@a. ruiz  i say all this  she s one of the only unruined characters currently  which means she s next
that would make since. but for the last several years  disney doesn t give two s its about continuity or writing.
this sounds amazing
pretty much
@raphael rodgers  this has nothing to do with being afraid of trans. this has everything to do with the destructive nature of trans allies.
what fight
@icemaster972  a stalker is making her life a living hell.
and it really sucks because karen gillan is a very good actress
@nick hammerschmidt  isn t this a chance for her to show more of her range
she is super fine in the comics. even the character from the first 2 movies is uglified.
they just wont let go. the more they push it   the more people pay attention  the more they pay attention   the more they oppose it. it s starting to feel like being harassed by an obsessive nutjob who thinks the more they get in your face  the more they insist the most chances they get to make you interested. and the more you push back.
@jackoblllllllll  that s what i was wondering too.....like if she wasn t a cyborg  let alone one with mechanical add ons for the body  then sure the change would make no sense. i personally hate the sjw movement  woke ideology. but if a character is like her to where they can mix and match stuff around  then i dont see the issue. data from star trek next generation was a android....if he got tits for a episode and acted hormonal i would have died laughing. but now in 2023  we can t laugh at that  or we have to only like stuff like that  we are not allowed to like multiple things. look at hogwarts legacy. people bought it because they either love hp  or they love video games  or they hate the woke movement. it wasn t just one thing people liked but instead a bunch of layers.
i ve seen this idea done better in two other stories   ghost in the shell  and   battle angel slots   last order  in ghost in the shell. they were talking about the identity of ones own mind. so  gender is an after thought.in alita  last order. sechs wanted to be different from other cyborgs. the character also wanted more power to defeat alita. so  sechs change her body from female to male.nebula in guardians of the galaxy. doesn t have this type ground work. worked into the story. so  this feels more forced then harley and ivy in harley quinn animated series. but  at least they work in the comics. so  i can see where the idea came from.this is like dropping grand master chief with conan  the barbarian into middle of a victorian drama and saying  look it works
@jackoblllllllll  no  it s just a look.
trans  transgender  and transvestite are different transvestite just means to find the vestments of the opposite sex preferable transgender is wanting to transition your body  entirely or not  into the opposite sex
gunn isn t an  agenda  person. his humor is sardonic and the story probably just has her swap bodies as a joke since she s a cyborg.i m going to start calling out the boy who cries  woke  if it turns out to just be a body swap joke just like c3p0 in attack of the clones.
thats up to the script  not her
unlikely. it s just another case of a bad mcu poster. this happens a lot.
they made starlord dress like sheldon cooper
@papa piker  gunn is absolutely an agenda person.
reminds me of the greendale mascot from community.
i dont think that they plan that far ahead tbh
@please get this 1 right  exactly like what    he s forsure woke af
i d prefer they give rocket a pair of huge jugs than give nebula a dad bod.
@swinky swink  if they don t change their body at all  but yet still calls themselves the opposite gender would they be considered a transvestite
@kitsukage9  no since transvestite is wearing the clothes of the opposite sex wlithout identifying as that sex easly way to remember would be transvestite - transitions vestments  has everything to do with clothes transgender - transitions gender  has nothing to do with clothes
@swinky swink  ah  when put that way it makes more sense  thanks bud
isnt that the guy who took over the ravager ship   oh wait  never mind  he s on the left lol
@papa piker  you forgot mr potato head  mr potato head has swappable changeable parts.
@please get this 1 right   gunn is absolutely an agenda person what do you base this on
@swinky swink  there is no such thing as  transgender . no one can be two sexes at once.
@please get this 1 right  he kept erza miller and let cavil go...that should tell you all you need to know....
@wayne a. pollock  agreed
@byron rush  exactly. it also works for women   every single show features lesbians  almost no heterosexual relationship. forever women have massively consumed heterosexual romance   got crazy over chads  read chick lit  got hysterical over movie stars and singers   it was a  billion dollar industry. they ve destroyed that very lucrative market. it  s not that they will mind the lesbians in the shows  it s just that it will fail to attract them.
i hope this change costs them extraordinary profits. they deserve it for continually forcing this absurd agenda
@backintime alwyn  it s like having a jehovah s witness not just knock on your door once in a awhile  but rather stalk you all day  every day trying to convert you. the more they do it  the more ya actually start despising them.
the media will say get with the times you homophobes.
jesus christ touch grass
@papa piker  yeah... that may be so  but i don t trust gunn after what he did to dc. got rid of batfleck  and henry cavill s  superman and kept ezra miller  not just for the upcoming movie that a had already been filmed and will probably lose them more money now  but for subsequent films...
@sarn   what he did to dc literally all he s done so far is make suicide squad 2  peacemaker and a few announcements. those announcements being only since he was placed as lead creative director 3 months ago.affleck for all the praise he got is still an unreliable alcoholic who s going through some personal issues. he s not a reliable leading actor.cavill was likely ousted by the internal politics of dc especially with dwayne johnson doing what he does best and trying to userp franchises to make himself leading man. that was literally the entire point of black adam.  hurr durr balance of power  that s not to mention man of steel was garbage from the start. cavill is better off for it.ezra is literally a liability play. the problem here is you re making presumptions of what you think is going on without any evidence of it. so we re they just supposed to scrap the entire project because they couldn t predict that their lead actor went on an egotistical drug cult rampage  the presumption is they re just claiming to keep him on until the movie s out of theaters. same goes for shazam  same goes for aquaman.at this point we ve come to a dichotomy where people either want to presume the worst and hope it all burns while lamenting those very same characters. if you want cavill and not superman  go watch his other movies.did you know cavill was in afghanistan movie  did you watch man from uncle
i can already expect them making mantis uglier too  shame...
that s a shame  as karen gillan  who portrays nebula  is one of the most beautiful women in the whole damn world!
i m both unsettled and morbidly curious with wondering if they re going to make a line saying that nebula now has a set of cybernetic ball and tackle
@cameron butler  she is not a robot.  she started out as a fully flesh-and-blood kree woman  with tits   then was cyborgized.all of her portrayals in marvel movies up to now have shown that  even cyborgized  she still had a feminine shape to her body.in-universe  thanos is the one who made those modifications to her body  seeking some kind of  perfection .  thanos is now dead  and can make no further modifications to her body.so why does her body now look like a man s   if alterations were made to her body  who made them   and why were they made these questions have not been answered to anyone s satisfaction.the most likely answer is that this decision was made by disney to push a trans-affirming agenda.most of the fans likely will not be in favor of that.
@sterlingdennett  what do you mean you doubt that  go watch then
damn here i was hoping we could make a man fill in for the strong female character kind of like how we made strong men characters into women roles or different race.
yes!! that exact scene i was like wait  what  whats up with her body
agreed.  i was pleasantly surprised when i heard that.  it tipped me from lurking to subscribing.
same! i had to subscribe when she started talking about jesus within 15 minutes of the first hogwarts stream.
lmao.  biblical truth    close minded people   holy shit.
@whill b  go away  troll.

i don t really get whats close minded about people not accepting religious beliefs even as a christian myself religion has historically been more accepted and common than anything else
am i the only one that cringes when she brings religion into every single conversation  calling everything  satanic  and  biblical   she can t just focus on the current topic. she always has to steer it towards religion somehow.
@disturbed kiwi  if you say that here people will tell you to not watch her vids or you are a troll.melonie is an unique person she s very religious despite indulging in basic media and games.a contrast to sydney watson who holds basically the same views but isn t religious nor cares for the bible as far i know beyond defending the right to believe in it.as a christian myself i just find it so well dumb and overused to once again label something as satanic like conservatives use to do to movies  games and rock music.
@chandller burse  i think what whitworth was saying was that it takes an open-minded person to consider that this push for less femininity and masculinity is an attack from the spiritual realm.
@jscriv  thats a very subjective debateable thing especially since people have often felt that religious people who always associated logical things with spiritual ones are clinging to a close minded old view.like thinking the stars are just lights or something instead of actual objects in space.but then again this is far less severe than  shivers  flat earthers.
@disturbed kiwi  probably because she holds a biblical worldview  and views the world through that lens  so naturally it comes through in her everyday speech.
one can hold values that are biblical without actually being a believer. many things are simply either or. it s light or darkness  yes or no  left or right.
lol  i agree  i didn t know she was a christian too. but i m glad she said that  most christians are afraid to say they are because of what society says.
link
unfortunately that s probably what will happen guardians of the galaxy 1 was fun and just one of my favorite mcu movies and been playing the game on ps5 just sucks the society we live in with crazy people shoving their ideology s into everything.
reminds me of seeing this thread on twitter  1 person was a japanese socialist type talking about his robot character being non-binary. there was also another case with anthony burch and the borderlands games  referring to zero  who is a mysterious playable character  as a they  this was after borderlands 3 launch  something about him replying to the borderlands official twitter about how many inclusive characters he s made. goes without mention that fl4k is also a they  and is a robot  even tho it s clearly a man as a robot who gained free will.in a weird subtle way  these people refer to robots as they because of genitalia or lack thereof  but these are the sorts who would champion gender fluidity and non-conformity as non-binary identity. i believe that that is part of their world view. to be inclusive u gotta characterise people as such. i think james gunn is the same type of person  he wanted to make velma a full on lesbian in the live action scooby doo movies  and probably be the type to support a full on harley and ivy lesbian romance. these characters are  coded  that way from the get go  right
gunn has never pulled woke shit  even in peacemaker all of the shit people told me was  woke  ended up being offhand comments.i m really starting to get sick of all this boy who cried wolf bullshit.
and it didnt happen before because thanos was a bad dad.
you mean  comedy . because gunns  comedy  is corny  cringe  and childish. dude is severely overrated
nebula going to identify as budget cuts
nebula is transgender   is now male  pronouns is he they.i m calling it right now.
nebula  i wish for you all to refer to me as  he. starlord  welp  that just happened! ensue laugh track
just don t watch it.
people always call something they don t like satanism.even if it is stupid and poor business practices i feel this is sort of the same as how people use to say elvis and violent video games were satanic.
@chandller burse  in the christian bible it clearly states matthew 6 24. no man can serve two masters  for either he will hate the one  and love the other  or else he will hold to the one  and despise the other.ye cannot serve god and mammon.so if it s not of god  then it is of satan. if it s not of god  it s of the world. which leads to satan. satan   satanic. we ve knowin this for many many thousands of years...
yes this! making a new androgynous character wouldn t be an issue  i just after how they keep doing this to existing characters who weren t initially that way
the thing nowadays you can t be androgynous without lgbtq politics being involved. so they ll never make a new androgynous character without the same problems being relevant
the other problem is that this is focused only for the female characters  while all the men continue to be beefed up  hot  men.
yeah make a new character and when it fails maybe then you ll realise no one wants that sh t
@nayru  that makes sense.
@avid collector  i m going to watch it for free   have questions and possibly make fun of it.it might be good or bad  only time will tell when i watch it.
in you actually google this movies poster images you ll quickly realize that this is just lower key variant style.and not the actual poster art. its kind of similar to the disco variants of part 2 with david hasslehoff not the actual finished product.
isn t nebula an android though  i mean  they covered this shit with data building a child on star trek decades ago.
@jaximus prime  no actually she was born a biological female  everytime lost to gamora a body part was removed and replaced with cybernetics.that s way she hated gamora for so long because thanos loved gamora more than nebula.
you can literally see her regular body in the trailer  it is just bad photoshopping job
i d be pissed  in fact i d probably walk out after exclaiming fk this shit!
you re probably spot on.  just another reason to avoid seeing marvel movies in theaters now.  wait to hear if they re trash or not and then consider streaming if not a steaming pile of dung.
@bryan dedon  and that is why i keep saying. i used to get exited for marvel movies  now at best i get worried on how they are going to fuck up the characters i like. i like starlord the most but i can already tell you i aint watching this one.
they somehow mananged to make karen gillan  a smoking hot woman  ugly.
or not watch it at all.
@jaximus prime  she s a cyborg  not an android
@dantastic mania  it s still an official poster though.  whether is the main one or not it still gives in to  the message  .
this sounds exactly like something disney would do.
@papa piker  then explain this shit    we are waiting...
@dan lo  it s literally just a joke. y know  like people used to do before 2012  or was charlie s angels feminist propaganda too
@yeah right  so you admit he s not a progressive.
they pulled that same crap with umbrella academy season 3. it was so stupid.
only if the comedy is in how a white man reacts. otherwise this is the one scene in the movie without a joke
@papa piker  he never pulled it  then why did they fire henry cavill and have a female superman in the flash  flashpoint paradox
it happened in doom patrol if im not mistaken. or was it the umbrella academy  one of the two where that chick who plays juno came out as trans so they made her character into a dude named victor  it was really weird and came off super awkward
stop  let me have some hope.so i can pirate it and not demands refunds.
i fear you re absolutely correct. marvel can t help themselves
what you say makes sense.  soooo.....they are finally going to ruin even guardians of galaxy also.  this shows you who gunn really is and what he will do at dc
@avid collector  no one should. it s perversion .
@andrew mcleod  also many thousands of years  matthew was written only 2 000 years ago.
@chandller burse  god has been around long before any books were written.. you know  from the very beginning... god speaks to us now as he did from the very beginning.
@andrew mcleod  its so difficult
i heard that second part in my head in the same voice and tempo as rita repulsa from power rangers saying  make my monster grow .
true and karen gillian in my opinion is a beautiful and good looking woman on her own
there is a nude scene of chris hemsworth in the newest thor like damn hollywood is asking for death at this point   males make up a majority of comic book fans and sex sells   but this is offensive to women as well
alright  in black widow s case it doesn t come across as a deliberate  hide the hot  attempt as much as it comes from the situations black widow is in not calling for the femme fatale outfit or the matching attitude. in im2 and ca2  she was with shield as an undercover agent as an expert in espionage and infiltration. she was trained for long-term postings with her targets to watch them and or interrogate them. both her outfit and her looks were used to this effect. jokes aside  she s not trying to seduce the avengers 5 years after joining them  especially when shield is gone  especially when there s a world-wide manhunt on her and the others and she needs to not wear her very recognizable shield-branded suit
@t00nyboy  so you re saying an attractive person wouldn t want to look attractive once they have a job for 5 years
@thecreepyarchives  sir  this isn t just her job  this is what she considers to be her family and her closest friends. you re talking about wearing seducing clothing to open battle with aliens because she wants to look attractive  even when the practical applications for that outfit are no longer relevant
@indigo wild whats a offensive about a censored nude scene with chris hemsworth unless its a double standard argument i mean its just whatever if chris was fine with it
it s not just marvel-supergirl is wearing pants in the new flash movie. it is so weird-looking i didn t even recognize that s who that character was.
@rob chuk  i m not a comic reader  so i ve got no idea if that s comic accurate or not
@thecreepyarchives so you re saying black widow isn t attractive in infinity war and endgame  she looks the same as before. you re acting like she wore five trenchcoats at the same time lmao.
to be fair in this case... have you looked at bautista  there s a reason drax is suddenly wearing a vest and has a chin thicker than his head. the war on femininity and masculinity  with a not-so-subtle injection of androgyny  has been seeping into the few remaining marvel projects that look decent. they don t want men or women to have the god-like bodies of superheroes.
as an aussie  and a new subscriber its really nice to see that we re not alone in the way some of us think  no matter how much society tries to say we are and we re wrong. it annoys me to no end that these corporations are bending over backwards for the minority groups while completely ignoring the bulk of us when we say anything. you seem like a great girl and i appreciate your take on so many things. i started watching when you were speaking of the new velma series as it came up on my feed. so keep up the work  fight the good fight and hopefully someone in a high positions will see the light and attempt to do something about it.
you have me in your corner. i m not a christian  i m not a gamer  but you have a voice that needs to be heard. nobody has 100  of the truth  but the things that you say are part of the truth. keep on keeping on melonie mac!!
im so glad someone is talking about this  not only the erasing of both femininity and masculinity but also how these entertainment companies always try to somehow make excuses and explain away why these characters get given these kinds of treatments in the first place   oh something happens to them in the story to make them look like this   and then the people go on to defend it. its frustrating because as a result most people cant see whats really going on and the agendas being pushed..
let me see if i get this straight. the abuse victim who was forcibly transformed into a cyborg and has expressed regret over that is suddenly subjecting herself to more body modifications  that doesn t send the message they think it does.
i m a little torn. on the one hand  i am in agreement with the idea that nebula doesn t have to be sexy in order to be on screen. on the other  they clearly established what she looks like already  and making such dramatic changes doesn t make sense except in light of current cultural discussions  which just seems like an appeal to a certain segment of society. and karen gillan did such a great job  especially in the first guardians  that it didn t matter that she s a very attractive woman in addition to being a tough cyborg  so i really struggle to see the point of making this kind of change  even if it s narratively justified somehow. it s as if someone in the process decided that she couldn t be both a tough character with emotional depth and feminine at the same time  which really just reinforces the idea that progressive gender ideology is misogyny in drag.glad to see you re getting over your illness and getting back to making the content you enjoy!

every single one of them has a different body then they are supposed to. this could be wishful thinking  but maybe it does have some sort of freaky friday thing in the story  or maybe it was just supposed to make us laugh while the actual movie has them with their actor s bodies.
btw  as a guy.. a hot girl can be the sexy nebula on the left in skin-tight clothes or the cute melonie in a fluffy hoodie. both of those are attractive. it s definitely not about how much skin is shown. it s the feminine energy that counts.
nebula was originally cast as a curvy woman  karen gillan  and this is what the audience expects.  motion pictures and computer games are about entertainment for the public  and not about what the studio cast and crew pursue in their private lives   hollywood is famous for being highly collaborative  and knowing each other  and endless parties and gathering.  there are been many  strange  hollywood stars with weirdo backstories  but this isn t what we see on the screen.  what is supposed to be on the screen is the canon of created characters  that after the first successful motion picture becomes a bible entry  the story bible   that is a record of how to present the storytelling.  this influence includes the artists  who latch onto certain ideas.  look at the movie iron sky  as an example   it is silly to project it into the 21st century  and the artist images are based upon well established views of germany from world war two  to alter the story bible offends the audience  especially for the characters.   finally  marvel should replace nebula  if they want a man to play the role.
speaking of lara croft  karen gillan the girl who plays nebula  could actually have passed for a very good lara croft in the reboot as she showed in the welcome to the jungle  jumanji series. but they had to go with tiny little alicia vikander and try to make her look badass which failed in my opinion.
it s always a good day to see melonie smilling. i m glad to see you melonie. hope you re feeling better
i m a big fan of karen gillan be it guardians  jumanji or doctor who and i have a hard time believing she s ok with this .
i just finally started checking out your videos.  it s so awesome to see you standing up for your christian beliefs while enjoying everything that nerd culture has to offer.  never stop being you.  praying for your stalker situation.  you know god s got this.
heads up  stay strong  everything will turn out fine    i just recently found your channel  because of the streams with drinker . love your content and the community you ve build. let nobody ever take that away from you and keep making great videos like this one! all the best from germany
love you melenone  i m  so glad you are doing better and you are doing such great things for the gaming community and christain community as well. keep it up!!!
i am super happy and glad that you are smiling again and doing better  friendo! you didn t deserve any of the crap that creep put you through and he will be punished big time for it. i love the sushi blanket hoodie  it s very cute and it suits you!  disney is at it again with their bs. i ve heard bad things about this film and it only got a 55  from the critics. the war on masculinity and femininity continues and we are sick of it.
well  i m glad this was revealed before i paid for any tickets.
you are strong  melonie  no one cannot control you!
i have a theory about this. in marvel disney s eyes  this is them making a neutral compromise  or at least that s what people that work within the lower ranks are told when they are told to do this work. this would be under the let s not offend anyone tab of corporate behavior. that s what every company s excuse is  to see what they could get away with.
black widow looked the same in infinity war and endgame as she did before. youre acting like she wore an oversized down jacket. you don t need to see her unnaturally swaying her hips as she walks  because nobody does that lol. captain marvel is an even worse comparison. her suits have only gotten tighter and more form-fitting since her first movie. scarlet witch uses less layers and tighter suits as well. she-hulks suit is skin tight and she even shakes her ass in a scene lmao. nebula looks like a woman in every single scene from the trailers. it just happens to be that her suits are little less tight  but she still looks like a woman. it s just this one poster where she looks weird. we ve gone full circle. now it s the anti woke that are bitching and losing their minds over minute details.
they made thor be fat to be relatable instead of people feeling bad and wanting to get in shape
@alex temple  they did that for comedic effect. why would they treat it as a joke if they wanted people to relate and not feel bad  wouldn t treating obesity as a joke do the opposite  lmao
@boogie  it was more than that thor was depressed thanos killed his brother and his people then he finally kills him but it s meaningless at that point in time because he can t change it cuz thanos destroyed the infinity stones then years later we have the time traveling shenanigans
@byron rush  they didn t have to make him fat just because was depressed. they made him fat because it was funny. it s clear that they didn t do it to spread awareness of what depression can do to your body. he was depressed  but they made him fat as a joke.
they made the character fat
@joshentertainment 2  i d guess he made himself fat and didn t want to put in the work to get back into 2014 drax shape. i noticed it in their holiday special. it was fun  but it s obvious the gym is no longer a superhero training priority lol.
@before movies sucked! just look at pratt  they made him look like a junky
he came out and said at his age it is too hard to stay abs lean. unless you have done it you don t understand it is a lot of work and hunger to stay that lean especially as you age.
@norman readdis  he is not using steroids in that picture and has gone back to his normal non enhanced size.
@rekcah keeg  that s true but that s kind of his job and i think putting in a lot of work to make millions is a pretty fair trade...
@rekcah keeg  pratts a very big dude even before the gym if you watch parks and recreation.
@rekcah keeg dude he s just a few years older than the rock and stallone still rocks some abs in his 70s and it s his job.
@norman readdis  he put on a lot of muscle in a very short amount of time. a good majority of marvel actor use gear to get their super hero bodies. chris helmsworth always shrinks in between movies.
@brandonheat243  yes but they agreed to let him gain the weight and still pay him millions. i assume they figure a less lean drax is better than no drax at all.
@rekcah keeg   in between  but not in the movie itself. love and thunder is his beefiest thor role. but unlike chris dave is just a side character so they don t care of his physique that much. also i do understand if dave is not a musclehead like the rock is but he s became thor in endgame. the only one that didn t change is mantis cause asian  and gamora underneath that green skin is a protected class. no shade on the actress. the the ravenger dude don t have any positive features to begin with so it s fine. oh and vin deasel can be fat  he s just a voice. lol as for ratchet  he s done.
@before movies sucked!  drax in the comics and other shows never wore shirts.always shirtless.
not at all. he has discussed this. he can t keep up the workouts and shortly after the last avengers announced the third guardians would be his last movie. it s a fitness issue  nothing to do with disney politics
@rekcah keeg  i remember him saying and knew exactly what it meant.
he said at his age it s harder to get into that kind of shape. i don t know what to believe anymore. also i m not even gonna pay to see these movies anymore. only movie i ve gone to see was the batman. everything else i pirate. screw woke hollyweird.
@norman readdis pratt said once all he ate for lunch was multiple cheeseburgers
@-redacted well at least someone didn t react violently to that one line that is easily written off anyways in the batman.
same
jesus is king.
@papa piker  jesus was a mushroom.
@quantum idealism  he was also a national socialist.
nobody has 100  of the truth...  is that absolutely true
@papa piker  ok  call for worldwide worship of jesus christ and his teachings
@papa piker  he died for our sins  friens
@highbudget  isn t that what you guys have always done
in our current environment  being a christian or observant jew is like being dressed as uncle sam in downtown pyongyang. i salute anyone that sticks to principles and won t follow the herd
@thingfish  i always love it when the guys who are the worst about persecuting others complain that about being persecuted  which is really just being agro about not being able to persecute everybody else like back in  the good old days  and one other thing  of the three abrahamic faith offshoots christianity islam and judaism   the jews are a perfectly fine people! they re reasonable intelligent usually don t go around starting holy wars or attack groups that don t share thier beliefs   the other two however are usually the ones who cause the problems
@omega mark   usually don t go around starting holy wars my friend  you should read the talmud.
@omega mark   seemed to have mellowed out again  go read the talmud. just wanna do thier own thing and leave everybody be if that were true majority of them would have moved to israel.
@omega mark   they ain t the ones trying to impose an 1100ad mentality except they literally are. their religion literally demands that they engage in the absolute reformation of mankind and they are the ones chosen to do so.just because you re ignorant of it doesn t mean it s not happening. so again  read the talmud.
@time to make the calligraphy  don t play with words just to sound smug. yes   nobody has 100  of the truth  and that  s only contradictory linguistically  not on a reality level.
@badluckcoderre  i have no sins needing someone dying for them  nobody i know does  and that only made him look like chicken for not standing up to the romans... or the devil. fight against evil  even die fighting  don t just allow yourself to be killed as a sacrificial lamb  that s cowardly.
@alexandre sobreira martins  everybody has sins. we sin everyday. with that mindset you re self righteous which isn t a good thing to be. nobody s a great person friend  it s just the truth.
@johnnyinzerillo  you re very evil.
@alexandre sobreira martins  because i m trying to lead people to heaven  the first step to following christ is fear of god. people need to learn humility and stop being so prideful in themselves. everybody is wicked and we can t save ourselves. everybody has had intrusive thoughts  everybody has done something wrong. when we sin against god  it s a big deal. you call me evil  but that s exactly how satan deceives you. good is evil and evil is good nowadays.
@johnnyinzerillo  yeah  let s all live in fear of a fucking heavenly monster. very nice and uplifting. might as well worship cthulhu.
@alexandre sobreira martins  something can t be heavenly  and a monster. you should fear him because of what he can do. he can deliver us our rightful punishment  but he gave us his son instead as a sacrifice for the world. without him none of us would have a chance at heaven.
we have to worry about the lies that they are spreading.
she looking like billy corgan in the ava adore era
misogyny in drag.. that s a good one. i m filing that one away with trendsexual.
the sanest person in these comments
we can hope  there is a thin line between satire and agenda  we can hope it  s the first
i think everybody here is overreacting. she looks very much like a woman in every single scene she is in from both of the trailers. she only looks weird in this poster.
exactly! cover up ladies  we guys are still gonna find it attractive  it just makes us more curious and eager to pursue
xd hahahahahahaha.... nop.
nah  i don t think so.if i were to measure my heart rate when i see a nice woman at the mall  it is probably going to be around 50bpmif i measure my heart rate again when i see the same girl at the gym in some yoga pants  its gonna be around 100bpmif i see her at the beach in a bikini  the lifeguard is giving me chest compressions because i just had a heart attack.this is anecdotal evidence  i can t apply it to all guys  but the amount of skin revealed has a massive effect on me.
@gregory carnegie  you should work on that.
@josh signed  work on what .... about why a woman who shows skin seems attractive ... -.- are you going to tell him what he might like and what he might not
@marcos gonzales   on controlling your reactions to seeing skin. you can feel the attraction with no shame  while also treating yourself with maturity and reminding yourself you are not your impulses  nor she is just a body to the taking. gregory doesn t say this  but knowing how uncontrolled lust keeps ruining lives not just around me and mine and how much wandering eyes can become an impairment  i ll keep my warning up.
@marcos gonzales  i m your average guy. i m just not a child.
@josh signed  -.- are you sure... you re not a child  because you are trying to control how someone talks about themselves and their preferences..... just because he doesn t do it the way you want. that seems pretty childish to me.
@marcos gonzales  yikes  got me!
yes! the  energy  or  attitude  is such a big part of attraction that always gets overlooked when talking about females.
no simping
the women on here aren t gonna sleep with you because of that comment  cute try though.
not sure i agree  i think gillan looks too  soft  to be lara and never feels powerful to me. she is a fine actress but doesn t feel like an action hero. i don t hate vikander in the role  she isn t classic lara but i think she played it fine and captured the coy cocky nature of lara fairly well and was believable.  at least within the scope of the awful script she was given to work with . come to think of it  i can t think of a single modern  a-lister actress that would fit as lara croft well at this point. its almost as if hollywood is purposefully not casting those sorts of women anymore.
@ryan cooper  sure  to each their own. personally didn t like it.
@navnit kumar  it wasn t a good movie by any means  i just think viklander was the  least of its problems.
@ryan cooper i mean the original design of lara looks like she belongs at a supermodel agency or in a porn movie to me sometimes.i don t know i was always more of an uncharted fan and nate looks hardened like he actually climbs and junk.
@chandller burse  i agree actually though for me i always felt old school lara was a manifestation of a dominatrix power fantasy. i have enjoyed the games since 96 but it always did bug me a bit how impractical lara s outfit always was for what she was doing. it broke immersion for me.personally  i actually vastly prefer new lara s look and feel. i disagree with mel that she was made uglier. i think she was made more  real  but is still gorgeous. if anything more gorgeous to my personal taste.  though i do agree with a lot of mel s feelings about how they wrecked the story and croft s personality  personally  i prefer darker tones so uncharted has never drawn me as much as it feels more like a swashbuckling indiana jones style where the feeling of danger is trivialized by all the one liners and upbeat tone. the reboot tr trilogy s more brutal and dire mood really appeals to me even if a lot of the key story points don t.
@ryan cooper  wonder woman is actually the manifestation of a couple being into bdsm and female dominance.i think actually people including of course feminists have tried to argue tough women in movies and games are not good representations they are manifestations of male fantasies about strong dominant women.but they are likely speaking out of their arse since samus aran was made a woman at last second same for ellen ripley.
@chandller burse  i think feminists just will always find something to complain about. there have been plenty of amazing female heroes in pop culture for decades and a mostof them aren t a sexual fantasy. its just that the left likes to conveniently forget. i don t even think the big boobs are a problem. some women have big boobs  that s fine.  though big boobs like that on athletes are rare because of body fat    what killed immersion for me with lara was her going through these tombs wearing a tight fitting teal top and super short shorts while being forever and always perfectly clean.
she is a sassy scottish lass and i am sure she isn t but she is also a hollywood star she has to toe the line
thank you!
double negative and a thanks lol
so  anyone can control her  lol
@animegamergeek  you know what she means lol.
the way you wrote that sounds like you are saying anyone can control her. take away the not from cannot and you ll be okay.
@david eskerlot  lol  i know  just thought it was funny
@melonie mac go boom  just rewatched your video about thor being  flicked  naked in his movie  it was definitely inappropriate for a film targeting kids  and it was clearly non consensual. they could have accomplished the  butt shot  they wanted by having thor taking a shower.
@albert nada retro  just add a few more nots.
@mazemind  triple negative to break the balance!
i think what made lara croft popular was her game being ok to very good overall depending on the game  and her generally being as attractive as possible with more and more polygons. what makes her powerful is her knowledge  agility  and abilities with guns
great stuff and perspective. glad to see more and more people take chances and publicly vocalize what s obvious to most but too afraid to say. new subscriber!
there s the melonie we all know.
nebula having a man s body is definitely a red flag in my opinion it s an unnecessary change i m still going to check out guardians-of-the-galaxy 3 just to see how it concludes it to see what james gunn does but this definitely has me concerned i m not going to lie
drax wearing a hoodie is understandable  i saw a thing that dave bautista said he s getting to the age where it s becomes harder for him to keep his shape so he s not going to be doing as many topless acting scenes
they are mostly wearing their new uniform in the trailers which gives a fairly unflattening look but even still  there is more curves on nebula in the trailers with the uniform than in this poster which seems a little bizarre. always enjoyed the guardians movies  hopefully 3 will still be good  but i m not holding my breath in this day and age! you never know  rocket likes body parts... perhaps all will become clear in a couple of months
super glad you aren t letting the situation get to you. you re an absolute champion!
so glad you re doing better melonie! keep up the great work!
that is actually a great question.... did not even realize that! literally a completely different body! karen gillian has a curvey body. that is 100  not her!
no  that can t be real. nebula was one of my favourite characters
much love melonie! glad you re doing okay.
if you watch the actual trailers  nebula looks normal  but in one scene near the end of the trailer she looks like this. i think what they re going to do is kill her character and she will have to be rebuilt or something and use a different person s chest..
melonie is such a kind person. i pray for her protection and for her to have strength.
i saw the trailer today and thought she looked weird  but i couldn t put my finger on why.it did seem like her face wasn t as thin as it was before  but the title of this video reminded me of how deep her voice was in the trailer. when i got home from the theater  i had to check to be sure it was the same actress.
i completely agree with you there s definetly a war on values and there is an undeniable link with spirituality overall. people will think you re crazy but that s the trap  the moment you start thinking the devil isnt real is the moment you know you are playing in his hands. you are either in the truth or in the lie there is no in between and if you don t think this is real then you ve already made your choice.
queen jadis aka the white witch from the chronicles of narnia is extremely powerful but portrayed as  very beautiful. yes she is unusually tall and strong but that s because she had jin blood in her. nonetheless  cs lewis describes her has beautiful and quite feminine along with being powerful and strong. i hope netflix doesn t butcher her or the chronicles of narnia but who am i kidding right
i love the guardians films and im very excited to see vol. 3.  i am taken aback by that picture but hopefully it has its purpose ala fat thor.  ultimately i have trust in james gunn.
it doesn t help that they placed drax in a seated position to make him look smaller and they also erased about 20 pounds of muscle from peter quill to make him look less buffed than his look from the first two movies.
nebula is now known as  nebulo lol
things are inconsistent all over the place.   gamorra is scared of the other prisonners in gotg1  but can pick up and carry the enormous guns of a spaceship to shoot at nebula in the second movie.
@mazemind
@chandller burse  it s context. the butt shot was intended to bring in a bigger female audience.  having zeus strip him with out his concent is a mocking of sexual assault. if thor is taking a shower he s nude by choice  and you could have had it as the conclusion to the  dad bod  to god bod .  montage.
@albert nada retro  i suppose but then again zeus is the pure definition of sexual abuse i kind of thought that was apart of the joke at the same time how zeus acts in greek myth.what a waste of his character though.
@chandller burse  and that makes it okay to laugh at it  not in my opinion  and i m tired of it always being guys as the punchline  nor do i want to see women as the punch lime either .
@albert nada retro  people use to defend sex jokes for both genders now people have double standards or they hate both at all.comedy is subjective and thats the issue i suppose but i see your point about making male sexual assault a joke.but i mean zeus is zeus and that says enough about how he views people.
@chandller burse  first it s not a  sex joke  it s a goof on male victims of sexual assault.  next  i blame stuff like this for desensitizing people  and making it acceptable to laugh at male victims of abuse in the mainstream.  i ve known guys who ve been abused and weren t taken seriously when they spoke-up and asked for help.
especially with all the work in putting on that torso. take a look at him without it and he s got a ripped v shape. less so as drax.
dammit now he s getting too old to play an actual hispanic sort of looking bane.he s our only real chance even if he may suck.i just want one good comic accurate bane.
it s not even a different chest  it s everything. look at his face  he s obviously a man and a different actor than karen gillan.
amen
nebulx
great to see you again  melonie. keep going boom! and have a great day   and that sleeved blanket looks sooooo comfy
you re the only video game youtuber i ve seen that talks about confidently about relationship with christ and i will forever appreciate that.
the end of this video is night and day from yesterday    glad to see you in good spirits today making a positive video. i ve got a long way to go but you kicked my butt to get to the gym and eat butter  i mean whoops eat better and i hope you can continue to do that to help many other people.  grazie  melonie
you are speaking many truths people are afraid to say   i m subscribing for your honest content
of course you deserve the help and attention you get melonie  people are doing it of their own free will  to support someone who got in a pickle through no fault of her own.
worst part is that considering nebula s personality and particularly her relationship with the concept of power if she were to switch to a masculine body  not a crazy notion as she s mostly cybernetic already anyway  she d probably go for something like steve rogers or even drax. she d boost that strength stat like she s min maxing. as for making characters ugly  my guess is that it s to protect people from their own insecurities. all companies care about is pr which empowers the twitter crybullies to drag people to their level instead of seeking to improve themselves. honestly that goes for a lot of things.also that hoodie looks cozy as all get out
i m happy to see mel smiling again!!!!
the consumption of soy by a man drastically increases estrogen. this is not an opinion  nor is it a hot cake  it is just a fact  and there are many other foods drinks that can affect your testosterone or estrogen levels.melonie is 100  correct about what you eat effecting these things!hope you re doing better today  and i m happy to see you smiling in a video again!!
i don t know about the outfit body change  but i did see something with karen gillum where she was talking about how strange her pose on the poster is. she said she felt like she should be leaning on something  but there wasn t anything there  so she just ended up in this weird stance with her arm up for no reason like that.
i love your hoodie! the sushi! so cute  and it looks warm! anyway fun video. i m baffled by the change with nebula... there was really no reason to do that to her.    glad to see you doing better!
hey melonie i just want to give you my thoughts bout this video for today and i just want to tell you that it is so great to see you back doing this videos for your boom channel melonie and for us your fans melonie. also i just want to tell you that i think that the director of the movie wanted to have her to dress up in guy s outfit to show how strong she is when she is in a battle instead of having her dress in women s outfit and getting it dirty   torn  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to make a comment on your boom channel and let you know what my thoughts are about from your video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home and hope you have a great blessed weekend too melonie. also god bless you for your hard work that you do for your fans like me and everyone else who follows you on your boom channel and on twitter  ok melonie. anyway god bless you and hope you have a great blessed day and weekend melonie.
in my eyes emilia clarke is powerful  surviving multiple aneurysms during her time filming got
nebula is effectively all machine at this point  so it would theoretically be possible to switch bodies on a whim. it s just a question of why she did  and why this one in particular. i ll accept it if they can give a reasonable explanation for that  but it s still going into the  ehhh  box.
this was interesting. glad to see ya back to doing what you enjoy and feeling better. bless. entertaining  as always.
i really like how you speak from the heart when it comes to your faith. people can  probably will  use that against you but keep the faith and it will come to benefit you in the end.keep being you mel  its really good  a breath of fresh air so to speak
always great to see another melonie mac video grace my feed. they always make my day.
spot on with your analysis!! celebrate our differences. they compliment each other. so many things a woman can do that a man can t and shouldn t do. and so many things a man can do that a woman can t and shouldn t do. but together they have it all together!!!  and a real man and a real woman would celebrate those differences with their mate!!!
watch the latest trailer too. i know they put em in their comic accurate guardian costumes but doing so removed all body shape. you can see mantis and gamora in the trailer have no curves when in those costumes. even drax now has his top half covered up with the new costumes. one minute 44 seconds of the latest trailer shows this perfectly.
keep up the good work love you
another day goes by  and i still dont regret that i ll never give any disney company a single red cent ever again.i was actually a fan of guardians as a kid when nobody else knew about them  i should be one of the most stoked for more movies.   but here we are...
maybe there s no female bodies  god that sound wrong out of context
explain his jawline. that s obviously a male actor.
nebula is a type of cyborg and i can see what they might go for. they might make it so her chest gets replaced. and that could work on a feminine journey if she hated it like how gren from cowboy bebop og how he hated his enlarged breast. but they got the guts to do that.
i loved nebula  her looks were super awesome   if they screw this up i swear.....
glad you re feeling better. onto more hogwarts!  d
you are not alone. most of us hate creepers. the problem is  there are only a couple of ways to show support  without starting to look like creepers too.
i m glad you re back feeling well! i am praying for your health  safety and well being  and praying for sean to be shown wisdom.
thanks for keeping on  even with all this drama. just showing my support  one raider to another. peace  !
dang that s crazy. guardians was my favorite and i was extremely worried about it because disney double and triple downed on being woke as of late. gonna watch this movie like a hawk to see if i want to support it now
i knew it i knew it i knew it!!! i saw the post on instagram and thought the same thing. and i went to the comments to find everyone talking about why gamora was there  although it makes actual sense why she s there because   in endgame the  past  her came to fight with the avengers  hence her coming back   just not the same gamora pretty much. but  i ve never seen anyone questioning about nebula. so i left a comment . a couple people agreed with me. but i seriously thought i was the only one really paying attention to that. now that this video is here i know i m not crazy!! thanks lol
it s great to see you doing better and you re at it again. i hate what hollywood is doing to women. things really need to change. great video and i love that snuggie you re wearing. stay warm and stay blessed!
i m guessing it s a joke. her head might get ripped off at some point and they ll just put it on some random dude s body. she is a cyborg  after all.
i watched a film last night called dual  starring karen gillan and aaron paul. fascinating movie about clones and duels to the death against either the original person or their clone. whichever person wins gets to live out the life of the original person. i think if disney goes down this route  it ll be a waste of karen s talents as an actor. plus  it s just another excusefir disney to say  it s 2023! let s force everyone to conform to the patterns of this world!
i saw some people trying to explain it away by saying   oh  she just made the mistake of wearing a t-shirt! it s just a t-shirt!  the t-shirt ain t the problem. it s the very obvious male body in the t-shirt. they stripped away her feminine form entirely. and  for that matter  seem to have done an edit on mantis as well to make her form look more boxy rather than curvy. they also made pratt look thinner and less muscular. and drax looks more fat and less buff. it s not just the women they re attacking.
yeah this had me like  what did they do to karen   i mean the side by side with the original poster is crazy. i hear aerosmith playing a song  oops someone already did the side by side lol
i was looking at the pictures on imdb for this movie.  the actress is still playing the part and there are screen captures of her in the film  but there are screen shots of a dude that looks like her also.  i don t know if this is a different character or if there is a gender swap that happens in the film.
it s funny  but nebula actually looks like a transgender woman-to-man.  this is how they usually end up looking  and i wouldn t be surprised if this is what is going on in the story.  after all  thanos probably wouldn t let her transition  being a big bad and all.  she is probably going to be going through transition during the show  and at the end of it  probably a post credit  or post climax scene  she is going to be a jacked dude.it will actually probably turn alot of people off of watching the show  but also be used as shield against bad reviews.
i have been saying this for years. now it is finally right in our faces. hard to deny it anymore.
good to see you smiling never let that joy or smile be taken away
not going to lie these are some really interesting times we are living in
hey now... y all got task master.we re keeping nebula
you re right. we need strong men and women to stand up and talk about these things!
is it worth watching
@wicker man  i enjoyed the film. it raises the question of ethics about terminal illness and human cloning  and the rights of that clone to live if the original human somehow survives their illness. say you have terminal cancer  for example. in the universe of the film  there s an option to clone yourself so that your loved ones won t miss you as much. if you were to go into remission and not have cancer anymore  you could decide to decommission your clone. however  if the clone decides it wants to live  by law  both you and your clone have to duel each other to the death. whichever one of you survives gets to live out your life  whether it s the original or the clone. i should add the film is rated  r   in case you have any problems with that.
@randall j. bell  thanks  i will watch it when i find it on a streaming site..
@randall j. bell what would the point of cloning the exact person be if the original still dies i thought an early concept was that people believed we could transfer our consciousness to a clone but that is actually impossible.so why even do it
yeah  i had no idea that a shirt could change a feminine v-shaped jawline into a masculine square jawline
aw man  i loved feminine nebula! she rocked
seeing this and what they did in ant-man puts me in mind of skipping the theater and just buying the dvd on sale.
loll they should play  dude looks like a lady  in the trailer
hi melonie it s great seeing that you are bringing moreinformation out there on topicsthat interest you.takecare melonie
yeah gamora and mantis also show signs of less femininity  gamora still has an hourglass figure but no visible bust shape. mantis  figure has also downgraded but at least her bust shape is somewhat visible  and both actresses look amazing irl!
just going to play devils advocate here for a second and say that mcu nebula s body is a hodge-podge of mechanical replacements for her original organic parts so there s an easy in-context justification for why she might have a more masculine or feminine body at any given time as it all depends on what parts she s currently got installed.
karen gillian is not a dude. she is legendary
in that poster gamora is uglified.but this poster doesn t fit the casting. the actors from the previous movies are still listed in the film.this poster might be showing an alternate universe gotg.but that seems like an unnecessary spoiler if true.it might not be as bad as this looks.
so now marvel is  fighting for women  by completely deleting what a woman is in their films.  makes sense.
fight the good fight and never give up your beliefs.you do deserve the support.
thank you for all you do   your not alone .
0 45  hit the nail on the head  mel.   wrapped up so nicely and succinctly.
in one of the trailers  starlord realizes he is becoming very attracted to how feminine nebula is  so this might be her way of shutting that down.
i m still trying to figure out why gamora didn t also turn to dust when iron man did the snap.
thanos altered her body for maximum late night bowling. we have to at last be halfway through revelation by now.
dad bod nebula will be teaching the audience how empowering it is to install a new mechanical sack in this movie.
@melonie mac go boom  your defense of biblical truth and simply common sense earned you a new subscriber. well done!!
come on...i was actually considering seeing this movie at some point in my life.
hey  folks. it s okay. this is just the wish version of nebula. wish is gonna be the new sponsor for phase 5. kevin feige has the wish fans in his heart  gang!
i mean the guardians of the galaxy have been  at least in the 1st movie  i have seen volume 2  known to be associated with the infinity stones and there is a reality warping stone so that s the only explanation i can give for this.
they already gave thor a dad bod
blessings are not earned  they are freely given. you are awesome. we got your back.
good to see you back to your old self and having fun !
i m glad you re doing so much better right now
don t worry rewatched the teaser and it looks like the poster just edited a ton it looks like chris is still more buff and nebula looks like how we know hope that they don t change anything but we should keep an eye on marketing
thankfully the movie industries have taught me two things since this kind of stuff started happening.1. i now know the key elements to making good movie is story and character development. aka  harry potter  lord of the rings  star wars  ext. 2. i now know that most movies throw away character development and just try to push some agenda which just ruins the movies and shows that come out of it. aka  the rings of power  and the latest star wars movies
regarding nebula  i am surprised that they would go this far. her lines will be monetized by streamers to no end. and lo and behold  the sunshine returns...
just sad. glad to see ya smiling sis and pushing through!
i like seeing melonie happy it makes me upset when she looked and sounded like she was about to cry on her video the other day
i ll be honest  she hulk was the final straw with marvel! checked out a while back
they ll probably point to her body being pretty much mechanical already as their excuse. she just decided to have it  redesigned
i will agree with the others i m glad to see you back at it.  as far as the poster goes  unless the change happens at a point in the movie that is not how she looks like  at least judging by the trailer. i could tell she was female. so i dunno what is up. seems odd to me.
this situation reminds me of this small novel i borrowed from my highschool library a bunch  called  epic  by conor kostick. it s about this vr  world of warcraft inspired videogame  called  epic   which  in the story s world  has become the means through which the inhabitants must make their living. if they are successful in the game  they move up in the real life society  but since the grind for money and good equipment is slower than a snail  it s very hard for the commoners to ever challenge the elites to secure good positions for themselves and their children  some even being banished to the salt mines. it also doesn t help that  if your character dies in the game  you lose everything and must start anew.the story starts with the commoner protagonist losing to an impossible dragon boss and urged by his parents to make a new character in time for the exams that will basically secure his education. in salty jest  he makes his new character a swashbuckler girl with all beginning stats pumped into the  beauty  stat  something that gave him no power  but at least made him look like an actual  beautiful character and not a gray  blocky and androgynous blob. but immediately  that decision starts paying dividends  as his character s beauty allows her to receive a large inheritance from her npc father  which the protagonist uses to gear up with his friends  challenge the boss and make mad cash in his quest to upset and destroy the societal status quo epic has created. this novel came out in 2004  but imagine if it came out today. someone being more than a gray  blocky blob would be considered sexist and it would be immediate grounds for cancellation  even if the protagonist never relies on beauty again  but instead on strategy  teamwork and exploration.
welcome back mel  hope you re well!
melonie it seems like you re doing better. i m glad to see that. we re here for you if you need it. remember isaiah 54-17 it s my favorite verse.
kg   wow  i am really not looking forward to the makeup and prosthetics again. is there some way i can get by that this time  jg   sure! we can do a digital scan of your face  color it appropriately  and put it on a stunt actor who will body-double for you. you just have to read the lines  and the computer artists will synch the facial animations. we made my own brother and bradley cooper combine together to be a racoon for however-many productions now! including this one! this ll be easy by comparison. kg   gosh  that sounds like something from doctor who! i m in! jg   come to think of it  i bet i could get my brother to be your body-double! -- while he s playing rocket  and the new reaver leader! that d be a great prank to break the internet with! kg   .....uh  sure  i guess...
i haven t gone to the theaters in years and this is one of the reasons why.
i love your videos! keep up the good work!
i ve been doing my part against this  can t remember the last time i gave marvel or disney any of my money.
lookin comfortable! i sincerely hope you re feeling better today.
the mcu defined over the years  a man who has let himself go
women being beautiful are not rounds for cancel culture.twitter and liberals still praise curvy beautiful women as much as tomboys and obese women.there are some issues and arguments sure but i ve never seen anything significant.even if movies are lessening the designs of such characters it means very little and so far even online communities seem to agree on the traditional ideal that beauty makes people go far.
also this novel sounds like it was a commentary on capitalism and how the world values beautiful people a little too much.
@chandller burse  the fact that the protagonist never relies on beauty again  and instead is an actual good player makes me think that it s a commentary on taking risks and thinking out of the box or else you re stuck into the elite-focused social norms.
@3 slices senpai  it can be a commentary on more things but its pretty specific to have him rely on looks to get anywhere for awhile then stop.
@3 slices senpai  work smarter not harder i guess but thats a boring overdone message now but back then maybe not
thank you so much  i feel waaay better today      3
@melonie mac go boom  i m so happy to hear it  take a break from the content if need be  we ll be here when you get back i promise.
melonie - you are 100   correct - hate what they did to nebula
yeah i am... i mean everyone is utterly baffled by the image.  it just is bizarre  and she s also separate from everyone else and in a weird pose
no   i don t want to believe this.no  nebula is totally badass female   i remember her from guardians 2.this must be a mistake   it must be.damn  if it s true  no!i was looking forward to guardians 3 too  but if they are doing this....stay strong  you are a beacon of strength
really  i thought she  karen gillian  was just pregnant cause she does look a little bigger than before and it seemed like filming guardians 2 had to stay on schedule with how quickly disney was pumping out mcu content. i think scarlett johansson experienced something similar just based off how i remember her physique looked fairly different from marvel movie to marvel movie. even nebulas left arm looks baggy when that arm is actually mechanical. there shouldnt be any reason that i can think of why it would look like a baggy sleeve.
old nebula
just caught this vid today  and yes we are in a spiritual battle...props to you calling out.  hope you re feeling better and i liked your cute outfit...my daughter wears an eeyore one.  stay safe.
not just a dude  out of shape dude. genuine  gentle femininity is actually kind of scary in its powerful affect on men. we respond strongly to it in its defense  and it strongly enlarges our affection to protect it from indignity.
love your content. keep it up.
if they don t come up with a good explanation i hope the internet will at least come up with a entertaining mocking name for new nebula. like we had jake skywalker in tlj  maybe we ll have gregula or something
there s a reason james gunn chose the high evolutionary as the villain  the villain is famous for working with an xmen villain mr sinister  mr sinister specialises in genetics and changing thingsthe high evolutionary altered wanda in the comics  and had a halfworld altered cow to be the nannythe high evolutionary in this movie is the creator of rocket as we know himso the mo of sinister and high evolutionary is to take something that doesn t need changing and turning it into something horridso sadly the message we re being told with nebulas new look  and rockets backstory  is that the mcu is being changed by disney whether we like it or not  as society as we knew it is no longer suitable
what a shame nebula was the smexiest character in that cast.
they went the complete opposite route with her comic book counterpart. she wields the infinity gauntlet and becomes her true beautiful self. but that would downplay the gunn and d  agenda
great observations  well said
hey! i just discovered your channel and i really like your videos! you ve gained a new subscriber and viewer!
what did gun do to my girl !   it wasn t weird enough that after yondu died that kraglin inherited his control fin but nebula inherited his dad bod as well  i m afraid to see what they did with whatever was left of him.
we need thanos more than ever before
didn t they make star lord bi in the comics  maybe this has something to do with it.
come on  i think we all know why nebula has a dad bod now...
i m sure it is as simple as the marvel execs said   you need a trans character in the new movie  so they decided that nebula would be the one. given that nebula is a robot  its it is pretty simple to write into the story that she just swapped out her body for one that is more fitting of her  identity . i can t stand this stuff but i m pretty sure every marvel movie has to pass a woke checklist to get greenlit at this point.this is such a recurring theme  look at evangeline lily in the new antman. who in their right mind was take one of the most beautiful actresses who ever lived and give her a boy cut  ps  that looks like the most comfortable and huggable sweater in the history of civilization.
they should have cloned raquel welch! she was the most feminine actress i knew growing up in the 60s 70s. truly a beautiful and talented woman  may she rest in peace.
it is very interesting how disney is doing this. even in a their game  dreamlight valley   which is more classic disney  you can purchase outfits as scrooge mcduck s shop  and all the mannequins which showcase the outfits are all male. it is very odd to see  dresses  skirts  crop tops  all female outfits  as well as all the male clothes as well  showcased on male mannequins.  dinsey s dreamlight valley  is more geared for an open audience  which means that the young ones are being shown this as well. it makes sense that they would do this  and have been doing this to female characters in their movies as well. also   we see this in how  supergirl  looks in the new flash movie as well. it is such the sad thing...
they gave her the taskmaster treatment
that s a fun looking hoodie. i hate what there doing with women in hollywood. makeing them more man like. i hope you re doing well melonie. love ya friend
unafraid to declare her belief in the bible  i love it.  keep it up.
i think disney did something in post.  i don t think karen gillian would let them do this to her.but to something more base  have you seen the trailer for nefarious   it looks awesome  has sean patrick flanery in it.
let s wait and see  if you see the trailers nebula looks like her normal self.
5 10 melonie speaking truth here
never feel you re not worthy . never. no matter who are you and what you do you re a human and you re worthy. take care of yourself and always smile
that hoodie looks so warm.
guardians of the galaxy is one of the few franchises doing fine. now they want to make it right.
rip nebula  we will miss you..  pours random malted-beer-product on the sidewalk
nebula looks like the bad guy in commando.
you know exactly what your speaking on  may you keep fighting the good fight  thank you for sharing the insights!
disney took karen gillen  who has a model body into this !
haaa whaaaaattttttttt   great to c that smile again btw
what s sad is that the actress is absolutely stunning.
thats one of the things i like about mortal kombat  the women in that game are very feminine and still look strong and powerful.
love you melonie. i know i m not alone when i say that.
happy to see you speaking your mind and making trouble again
new nebula looks like vyvyan from the young ones.  as much as i love the young ones  i ll pass on this version of nebula.karen gillan s gorgeous and feminine in a real way.  she doesn t look like overblown plastic hollyweird  beauties   which is why she s more gorgeous to me since she looks human.
i mean it does not make sense in reality  but it makes sense that disney would put nebula s head on a male body. this is what modern media likes to do...
this is making me self-conscious about shaving my head now.  but seriously  they won t stop until everyone is non-binary  etc.
@lvthor ascending  there s a lot of cool peeps that have shaven bald heads. like bruce willis and az
@the real stephentv  and vin diesel! praise the lord for a dope head shape lol.
well yes she wouldn t let them  but it doesn t matter because that isn t karen gillan. look at things like the jawline. it s obviously someone else  a male actor playing the same character.
no way  theres no way someone called  sean patrick flannery  exists  does he dress in a green top hat  no way  shut up  whats his real name
thank you so much  _
nebula crush gone! yikes
i can t believe they would do this. one day kieran gillen won t be under an nda anymore and can be honest about when they did this to her.
hey i love your content. all the support in the world! love from india!!!!!awesome content. !
1 22  my perfect example of feminine power is galadriel from the lotr books.
i love you! so glad that i found a down to earth gamer!
oh dear!! i wanted to see gotg3  if karen gillan has been cut  i will wait for reviews before i decide to see it!
nebula was an organic female at first.  she was later converted in to a cyborg  half organic  half mechanical.  i don t know the story for gog 3.  but cyborgs can replace their parts.  edit  i had to get in to my comic boxes for this.  but it appears nebula was killed.  when she was rebuilt  her body had less of a female appearance as much of her organics were replaced with mechanical parts.
my gosh groot and rocket looks very cute together    love that couple so much
this may be a plot point.  the villain of the film is the high evolutionary  who is notorious for nonconsentual genetic manipulation and experimentation.  he made rocket the way he is
isn t she a cyborg  maybe there will be some sort of head transplant joke in the storyline  i could see that happening
i hope you get well soon   take care of yourself and bounce back   sending prayers and positive vibes
funfact  even tho seeing nebula as a dude is a wtf moment  no one is surprised.
it is demonic. the lord created everything to be a specific way and order. the devil pushes for literally anything that strays off god s design.
thanks! glad to see you back to form!
another video yay hope your doing okay melonie!!!!
i love how she has the needler in the background
i m bringing up my son to be the sheathed sword. masculinity is like wearing a sheathed sword  you carry it  you train for it  you display it but you only draw it when you have to defend you and yours or those who cannot defend themselves. think for yourself  treat yourself with respect   try your best  carry the heaviest responsibility you can bear and walk with it. do this without complaining. love your family  protect and provide for them. that s your job.
according to imdb nebula is the actress she was in guardians 2
because james gunn will never learn.  remember a couple years ago when they cancelled him   people rallied to get him back. now he s doing nothing but pushing the woke agenda. it d jot going yo end well. people are tired of it.
couldn t disagree with a single word you said...regarding he who shall not be named  you re gonna win  try not to let it get  to you  but in the mean time just remain vigilant keep doing what you re doing and you stay classy
that s the obvious story they are trying to push. it s about them using that as a excuse.
the thing is  we ve already seen her being mostly machine  and she still looked relatively feminine. you d need her to be functionally killed  which would be stupid to do offscreen  but that would be necessary for the poster to make sense  for her to have such a drastic change to be necessary.
what marvel does with its video product is a joy for lots of people.you mention a look into your box of comics.  print material  with stories just as sloppy in  fixing  the canon origin story  as the crafting of product with the films....only better at changing everything.the characters of capt. america and bucky  as an example.somehow  after almost 70 years  the 616 versions are now the same  only different.counter earth three contributes a nomad bucky  who is female....and three other versions exist.the value of knowing what and why of the marvel universe  in all its manifestations  seems to onlybe important if a person wants it to be that way.
@the unknown gamer   as i recall  thanos rebuilt nebula and adopted her.  his intent was to send nebula and gamora to retrieve the soul stone so that nebula would sacrifice herself and gamora return with the stone.  but that did not happen.  and if the movies were telling a counter earth story  your argument would be valid  they are not.   i was trying to provide a reason why nebula could appear less female and used the comic s changes as examples.  but since i don t know what the gog 3 story is  it is just a guess.
bump
amen!
this is why you never skip chest day.
looking at the pictures and comparing them i dont see the   nebula   from the right being the same as left. look at the facial structures. it appears to be someone else. dont know the plot of the movie so i cant say why its the case. perhaps it is what you believe it to be  perhaps its tied to plot somehow !
i remember nebula in the first film explaining to gemora how everytime she lost a dual to her  thanos would take a piece of nebula s body and cyborize it.i very much doubt that nebula would approve of this woke body approved nebula just absolutely trashing what was left of her feminine body  no matter the reason. hell  i d go sl far as to say the old nebula would flat out kill this woke nebula out of sheer disgust.
yeah  when i saw the trailer  i was   ok  a few years have passed...but she ain t the hot psycho killer anymore
thanks for the heads up. i won t waste my money or time watching garbage. too bad because i liked this series and it is just trash now.
you never know  marvel can really do that. nebula is cyborg so maybe they give her male body just for comedic purpose.
you just keep making videos. we got your back
wait also... why is yandu not a blue dude and how is gamora alive
good to hear you re a sister in christ melonie! i m so glad you re speaking the truth  praise god.these are wicked times and the depravity and satan worshipping is at an all time high.
as long as she doesn t be like  i am a dude now  then i think it s probably not too bad  it s stupid but not too bad
great to see you cracking on with doing your thing. as a 48 year old guy i like seeing a beautiful woman looking beautiful  guess i m old fashioned and out of touch. what a strange notion to have.
it s like the  de-caking  of bryce dallas howard in jurassic park. she is a fully-formed woman who is a blessing to blue jeans it seems like they are afraid  now  to show that a woman has those bumps that make us jump
she s doing the same kind of pose in the guardians of the galaxy 2 poster also lol. i m pretty sure it s just how the photo is edited because if you watch the holiday special she still has a girl s body
it s great to see you glowing again and being happy  you have an incredible style but most of all your faith and sharing it is amazing you have a great ministry
that s not nebula. that s billy corgan joining the blue man group
i just told my gf about this news  she s so pissed she keeps sending me rants on wa about how much she used to love nebula and how much she wanted to believe in james gunn and like this this movie
relax it s just a bad angle she s a little older and been eating good with all that bank  and i think she just can care less about looking hot with the character i mean nebula is a cyborg super soldier.
i think for robots they are trons...not sure though.  maybe they upgraded her r.a.m.
this is my first time seeing your video thank you for defending the lord. may god continue to bless you
it s not just the poster. there s a still of her in some kind of uniform with a flat chest.i m loving that hoodie lol. can you post some closeups of the funny characters on it
nedula was one of the bests guardians . i m been a big of karen gillian for years.  it s makes me very sad nebula is now a man.
the strongest examples of the female hero is mary of nazareth mother of jesus  and  coming in second  ripley from the alien movies. mary heroism was being the stalwart mother while raising her child to confront the chaos of the world in her preparations of knowing he may likely die. and soooo met some chaos while doing taking on the sins of the world. imagine being that mother. this doesn t necessarily require children necessarily  but stalwart nurturing to prepare a child for the brutality of the world despite himself not committing any sin  while teaching and healing. ripley played the maiden transition into the stalwart mother role through the alien movies. she did this without showing much of her curves  given the circumstances. she also wasn t too butch amount it.
no  mel  you re not being unreasonable.  the filmmakers are!
they want to make people unhappy  unhealthy  medicated  childless and weak. easier to control and submissive. it s well known that when people are outside their natural roles  they tend to be unhappy and less confident.
great video melonie. best way to handle a insane troll is to ingore them.
i never got into guardians.of the galaxy but wow! the world is just confused lol.
nice to see you back in action!movie posters used to exaggerate actors actresses positive attributes. this is the no-gloss  npc s only version of the guardians characters. i don t think any of them look good
i guess she wasn t there for picture day. oh man why they got to do that to nebula lol
aloy s face is a good example of intentionally ulglfying women  yes her face is based on a dutch female model  don t remember her name   but she is loosely based on her. the director  who is a self proclaimed feminist  admitted that he thought the model s face and i quote  looked like she would cry if she broke a nail  so he purposefully added masculine features to her face  to make her  look stronger . for a self proclaimed feminist  this is misogynistic  he basically said she looked weak and needed manly features to be strong.
nice to see you smiling again! i love your hoodie! it looks comfy! sushi go boom!
it looks like nebula got a beer gut.
south texas loves you mm. keep up the great and entertaining work
from nebula to ned.
that is sean gun... james s brother. he was in the first two films and was given yondu s arrow. he s very lanky and yet flabby  so all they did was paste her head on his body. this is typical for marvel to avoid spoilers or mislead people. like how in trailers and posters for infinity war  bruce was his usual big green hulk  but in the actual film  hulk refused to come out so banner used tony s hulk buster suit instead.
i agree a lot with most  but nebula  if there s ever meant to be a trans character  i d go with the one whose most of her body parts  aren t hers anymore.
for me  it was princess leia in star wars and esb.
the destruction of masculinity isn t just a hollyweird thing its our churches too. we have a society of weak men. i appreciate you bringing this into the spotlight.
i don t think this is that bad. if they just changed it. like black little mermaid sometimes it doesn t matter
in my experience with women  one of the most salient features of femininity is constantly thinking and or saying  it s so cold in here!  and wrapping themselves in snuggies.
your awesome chicky !! thanks for ya time and for the content. have a smashin day and god bless you
nothing says strong wahmen like modeling  your female character s face like she suffering from a bad bee allergy.also i like how the director said that as if alloy wouldn t cry from a broken nail with her current man face.
it s not even her head. look at the jawline.
i am sure karen gillian will love wearing the  dad-bod  suit.
whatever she s wearing looks comfy af
i noticed this in the preview  thank the maker it s being tackled
if they can do taskmaster dirty  they can do karen gillan dirty.oh and stay positive and enjoy what you re doing.
maybe the spot was for thor originally but they just put nebulas head and arms on there  p
the character formerly known as nebula  now goes by the name nebobula   karen gillian could never be mistaken for a man  hollywood must be the most vile place in the world
this poster has actually really dampened my excitement for this movie!  it was the one marvel movie i thought could be entertaining  but no  i m not so sure.
if you look at the actual poster and not just her you ll see that everybody s body shaped kind of weird. people making something out of nothing
god bless you melonie! you have a new subscriber! keep fighting the eternal battle!
just make everyone into an amorphous blob because that s what we all want  thanks marvel.
i agree that marvel has changed for the bad in many ways but nebula looked the same in guardians christmas special and really only seen a few seconds of her in trailers. just really really like guardians of the galaxy and seemed like that was one of the movies in marvel that kept it s core strong. not to mention having chris pratt hes not one to take roles that would do shit like this. the actress that plays nebula is beautiful only thing i thought is she put weight on it s been quite a few years since therr last appearance
was already gonna skip guardians.. this just reaffirmed my decision
dad bod is what every women should strive to achieve
nice work boom  stay strong!
more importantly  where did you get that sushi blanket sweatshirt  i want to get that for my daughter.
i m going to be dumb but didn t she in endgame kill her past self  so nebula shouldn t even been in this movie let alone gamora cause she died in there orginal timeline even if she s a ult  which brings up a whole mess of worms  she doesn t have the same character development so she won t have feeling for peter or any of the characters
just had a discussion with a homeboy about this. men don t hate female characters. there are many women in media that we grew up on and love. it s the fact that they bastardize these stories for the sake of wokeism.
i think dad bod was the description you were looking for
lara croft was at her peak when nell mcandrew fought skateboard kid and actual cowboy.
i agree with you melanie on the  woke ideology is anti-biblical  statement...you re not alone
nebula got the  last of us 2  abby treatment.
saw this poster and thought  when did i join the guardians cast   lol
they didn t even give nebula a decent man body  they gave it the 52 year old alcoholic that never goes to the gym body.
your christianity is a rare gem in this increasingly anti-christian culture  melonie. thank you for mentioning that in your channel. you are doing jesus  work fighting our culture. i already follow critical drinker and nerdrotic  but their language leaves room for improvement. you ve earned my respect and my subscription  sister. god bless you.
my passion for marvel movies ended in endgame.
hopefully gillan will have better luck with whatever job gunn sends her way in the dcu.  hopefully starfire.
yeah i think they deliberately used a male stunt double and photoshopped the actress s face onto him  because there s no way that shirt s baggy  it s kinda form fitting and that form just happened to be put on a male double  instead of karen gillan herself  lalso just letting you know that the    tolerant    left is still attacking hogwarts legacy streamers  this time they are targeting vtubers  specifically  one of my favorites  silvervalebut why  -i mean we know why  but there s a bit more to it this time. see twitch has this  automod  function that depending on your adjustments  a simple slider  automod automatically filters out certain words without the user s knowledge. and  you guessed it  the    tolerant    part of a certain community jumped to conclusions and thought silvervale herself was banning people for using that word  it should be obvious as to what that word is  instead of doing the goddamn research and figuring out on their own.now silvervale is devastated  distraught in her recent stream to clarify the error  but she did not apologized for playing hogwarts legacy  since she made it very clear that she only wants to relive the joy she had for the wizardry world of harry potter back when she was just a child  and wanted to share her joy to her audience  for her streams are wholesome. and just like other streamers before  she was brought to tears.and i am mad  mad that i had to see her lose part of her spirit and being helpless. so uh... just wanted to let you know  the battle is far from over.and uh  look into it  l
trying to research this yielded articles with this title   guardians 3  looks like nebula is getting an update ... the article is only talking about nebula getting a new arm but seems like an odd title in context of this video.
i legit thought at first it was a new character and had to do a double take when i saw it. not surprised they did this  it is disney and pushes the message of it is ok to be mentally ill.
they made her look like billy corgan
remember in the movie where thanos tortures nebula and her body literally pulls apart into multiple pieces. i bet they going to say she is modular and they can just pop her head on a different body  mr. potato head style. then they can call her trans.
i thought her head and make up looked really weird in trailer... not that she didn t look weird before  but knowing what she actually looks like as normal human  disturbing
now james gunn is in charge of the dcu. how fun.
i saw the trailer and it did strike me that everybody looked worse than they had even in thor love and thunder. i just chalked it up to the actors getting older!
stay cool  stay safe  you re awesome
it hurts my eyes. thanos would never approve.
i hope james gunn won t be like this under dc. this makes me concerned.
i am way behind on the mcu films... and the ones i did see   it was ages ago and i barely remember a thing... so i ask   is nebula an alien or an android   if she is an android  that could   explain  this trans-stunt.
so adorable  be brave and fearless
nothing marvel dishes out is worth shit anymore  i ll gladly be skipping this as usually do with the msheu. also glad to see you feeling better  keep on nerding out it s the best medicine for you.
glad to see you smiling again
new nebula looks like a younger yondu.
ok...i m going to call the end of guardians of the galaxy is at the holiday special and anything that follows after is fanfiction.
they don t want any attractiveness when it comes to women. because making women attractive is  pandering to the male gaze . even though most women are naturally attractive  and loads of women also like looking at beautiful women.p.s. few women make an oversized hoodie look as good as melonie mac. stay awesome!
don t ever feel bad for support!!
the estrogen push is to make men into consumers. a trait that is ingrained in men is to conserve and to be discrete spenders. we preserve our resources basically they want us all to buy the latest items and be spenders. watch how a man goes to a store vs. how a woman goes to the store. we go in like seal team six and focus on what we re getting and gtfo. women tend to roam and buy more random items they found pretty or they got lured to buy from a vendor. also good to see you re in better spirits mel.
i agree with you completely
glad you are feeling better.
thanos  a man  replaced her body with mechanical parts to make her like the ideal women  gamora   now she is on her own and is rebuilding herself how she  feels  aka a new mans body and limbs that transform to what she wants. ironheart is too far out for disney to push this stuff on us  so now they are easing it into the series that we all love knowing that itll still bring in huge bank because its gotg.
karen gillan  was always beautiful in my opinion and them doing this is not doing her justice at all and in fact is dragging her imagine through the dirt.
i just don t get it. wasn t nebula the very definition of that new hollywood was aiming for  female empowerment  she was badass  complex  beautiful  independent  relatable in her feelings of inferiority to gamora. why did they think that stripping her of her feminine traits is a good thing  she was the example of what a female character could and should be in multiple areas.
that s why i love bayonetta  she s hyper feminine
i fucking love nebulas character. if it s turned on its head because some corporate fucks thought she wasn t good enough they have to change her. man that s fucked.
next they re going to explain  her attraction to any gender because she s a cyborg.
when i think of a strong female character the first ones that come to mind are cersei lannister and catelyn stark from gamr of thrones. neither women is physically strong but both are politically strong and would do anything to protect the ones they care about.
they did her dirty   . please feel better melonie!
what makes a man his strongest is working  standing up and fighting for a women and family. men and women are at their best when they work together.
i think james gunn had one good movie   the first gog   i m done with all super hero movies past few years . i just reread all the old comics i have and old marvel movies   i actually dusted off my old pre disney star wars dvd and player
i don t know about you but i m digging the new smashing pumpkins album cover  billy looking fit again.
i may not be christian  i m catholic  really   but i gotta say that you spit facts like it s your passion. love your channel. keep the content coming
thank you
maybe it s nebula s brother or something.
i think your voice sounds better this way actually.  a girl once told me the same thing when i had a cold many years ago.
i m glad you re doing better. there s an attack on men and women there s attack on gender as a whole.
that s a shame. i got a crush on nebula. mainly cause karen is gorgeous.
i m gonna miss karen s body.
who knew i d have the body type of super hero!!
at least starlord lost some weight  looks so much better there than he was in the last film.
you are based  real  and true.
it s probably part of the plot
we don t know the context yet  maybe she got   rebuilt   but the male like body is the best her team can find
karen gillan came right out and said she did the pose and thought she looked cool but it didnt come out right and regrets it but i see what you mean  her body looks more like a high school guys than a curvy lady
glad you are feeling better. now remember to drink water.  and maybe some orange juice.
i saw that poster and i had to do a double take  because i thought that was yondu without his mohawk
i agree. they did nebula dirty in this poster.
yeah melonie -let no one damage your calm !!
when i think of a powerful women  non-fantasy  i think of judge judy.
agent 47 really let himself go.
bungie s destiny lightfall expansion is coming with these new cloudstrider characters. they are clearly guys  but bungie has been advertising nimbus  one of the two cloudstriders  as  them  instead of  him  even though he has the body of a greek god... i m excited for the expansion  but this pronoun stuff is confusing.
alright i admit it.  i am the new nebula.  i ll start taking questions now.
i m suspecting this is a reference to some short gag in the film where she loses her body and they find a temporary one  and proceed to make fun of her. most of those woke elements in film marketing lately are usually cherrypicked to make people talk about it. then it turns out to be a nothing burger.
if she had a mohawk  she would look more like yondu than nebula...
see kids  nebula can change her body and so can you. be a superhero!!
happy to see you happy again!
you got my sub for sure great video
remember how hot rogue was in the x-men animated series  still excited for what marvel will do with her
i m sure karen gillan is pleased to hear this about her body. she talks about this pose in one of her tiktok videos. she is 100  female
god bless you for being a proud christian. hope you get to feeling better soon.
is there a chance it s a different character
stay strong mel.
for real  also hope things get better for you.
love the dad-bod look on chix.
i haven t even brought myself to watch she hulk yet because i m a huge tatiana maslany fan and i hate that they wasted the chance of her being a big part of the mcu. people constantly complain about a lack of female superheroes yet when they get one they make her manly  it makes no sense whatsoever.
it looks like they gave starlord some child-bearing hips as well.
strong men can protect  care for themself  care for others. strong women can support emotionally  make you able to carry your burden and help you with your emotional struggles. and with both  extremly important is trust. being able to trust and being trustworthy. not being jealous  being self-confident  being successful  all of that helps. and a huge factor is being different. being able to offer and give something to the other person. and allowing yourself and others to focus on the things that makes you different and who you are. it s a bit like a puzzle  where the parts stick together  because the shape is totally different  but adds up. and woke culture just wants to make everything the same to split  to divide  to make people lonely and society weak and easy to controll
she went from hot to bill burr.
sean is a very jealous and insecure person and he can t stand it even if a man besides him is merely talking to you or even casually look in your direction. a lot of men suffer from insecurity issues like that and some of them deal with it in unhealthy ways. add delusional to that and it s a huge mess for a man to deal with. people create delusions as a defense mechanism because it takes a lot of strength to deal with reality and the truth as is. and some people don t have the strength to face the truth unfortunately.
at some point in american history californians forgot what being a happy american was all about and were just like   screw it  we have all the media control  let s just troll people.
nebula out here looking like chris pratt lol
keep it up  melonie. your belief in christ is what keeps me coming back. i do like karen gillan  though. so that s two reasons.
i like how my comment got deleted or filtered out. all i said was your wrong on this one as karen herself said she is the one who made the pose  not some guy  and even questioned why she posed that way as it looks goofy. its on her tiktok about it.
i love this franchise and this poster does not look promising at all. i ll wait for the reviews on this one.
marvel has gone down hill to be honest.....i bet your looking forward to hogwarts legacy  it s an amazing game so far  can t for the stream melonie  keep smiling
my money is on nebula over nebulo on bench curls.
drax having a shirt on is weird enough. but then this. i had low enough hopes  but i thought i might like gaurdians 3. nvm. spiderman is the only hope now and they ll screw that up  too.
me when i don t know what tomboys are
this was the only marvel franchise i was still interested in.  i guess i just saved 20 on a movie ticket and popcorn
happy to see you go boom again
it is a very strange world we live in  my friends. i hope it will lead to something positive one day  but i doubt it. self-validation has supplanted self-preservation as our primary instinct and i fear we are doomed because of it.
we need to bring back the femme fatale characters give me some of that f a y valentine and fujiko for lupin the 3rd hypo ladies
that s not nebula! that s nebula-oh   .
devils advocate here...  i wholeheartedly agree with you  however nebula is an android and can alter her body if needed. this may just be a  comical scene    like  let s make fun of quill by putting his body type on nebula  type moment. or it s a replacement body for a short time  idk. guardians is pretty much stand up comedy with a little action after all.
stay positive kiddo  don t let the bastards grind you down.
it looks like someone put nebula s head on bill burr.
keep on keepin on  and god bless!
nebula looks like the young man who recently changed my oil...
okay listen mel  as a diabetic since birth with a bunch of health issues hitting his metabolism i don t appreciate the  man let himself go  reference because trust me  most of us try our hardest and still get that. genetics is a real thing  don t put as all in that category we deserve some love too. thank god my girlfriend doesn t think like you...
they ll make an excuse for sure  but anyone with an ounce of intellectual honesty knows why they really did it.disney
isn t nebula supposed to be some hardcore badass cyborg space warrior who s always serious and intense  i just don t personally see her doing this at all  especially given that i didn t see any signs  in the early on in the movies but if she s going to change her body i would assume it would have been a buff male body too. if she wasn t going to transition and she was going solo i would have thought she would have been looking for space treasure or something. i m still going to watch the movie but if the justification is stupid and the movie is wack i probably wouldn t recommend it.
that hoodie looks kinda like a squish pillow!is it as comfy as a squish pillow  my daughters are little and they love that kind of stuff
yeah  that s a  grab me another beer  body too. w t f.
i love your pro bible talk! ppl need to awaken  because bible prophecy is coming true daily.
diet absolutely plays a role  no doubt.
maybe she gets a new body in the movie or something
preach it sister!!!
mantis and gamora look like they are wearing a baggy mechanic s jumpsuit.
excelent  video  just one thing  my wife and daughter wants a polar sweater like yours  were i can find it
let s go mel! greetings from italy
how does a robot cyborg  let itself go   hahs
i thought nebulous s body looked different  i thought i was trippin.
i hear that in the comics  they made star lord bisexual.
the most powerful woman i can imagine is eliza bleu.
love ya melanie keep your head up. quartering sent me to your channel awhile ago. stay strapped
i sense that the actors are tired of marvel honestly  they aren t even trying anymore
don t know why they would make nebula a dude when her and quill do have a romantic relationship in a few comics
glad 2 you well mel youre great  funny n very smart woman
looking at the picture it seems  to me at least  that a lot of time has passed. the guys have let themselves go and turned into lazy men suits. the girls have also also let themselves go. and nebula turned into a guy. hahaha
probably gonna be some shit about how she got damaged in a battle or something and they only had a male android body to repair her with. also  you can t convince me that melanie is actually 36  i think that s right    definitely only 26.
why does groot looks like a  teenage mutant ninja turtle lmao
is anyone else confused by groot s design  to me it looks like they put baby groot s head on adult groot s body. but yeah  i m tired of hollywood changing the looks of actors and actresses. for some roles  i can understand that actors actresses might try to fit the characters look better scarlett johansson dying her hair red for natasha  but changing an attractive actor actress and make them ugly or take away their body type makes no sense unless that is needed for the role. i get there is a lot of pressure to look a certain way and not everyone can meet those standards  but let s be honest  we don t go to the movies to watch unattractive people. that s why when aliens get designed  if we are supposed to think they are good guys  they still look attractive. very few exceptions.
i.. don t know about the satanic stuff and mostly ignore that because it sounds silly. i did find it funny though that when i saw this on twitter people actually tried to defend that this was still the same actress and not some dude.
it s a mercy that thanos isn t around to see his daughter reduced to this.  dude nebula   no thanks.
it s either lousy art or a character remake  possibly part of the story arc with the high evolutionary  meanwhile i can t believe you are in your mid 30 s  you look like your mid 20 s and sound like you are 20! amazing! glad things are working out for you considering the  legal thing .  love that hoodie sweater thing! carry on!
they did the same thing as with taskmaster  put her head on a dude s body
keep rocking!
they gotta be trolling us. that poster doesn t make anyone look good.
there have been a few animes i watched where some characters change sex at the drop of a hat from either water  seeing something  or doing an act. it reminds me of the transgender movement and i couldn t in good conscience continue watching anything that makes sex conflated  flippable  or distorted.
i was worried this would happen.just like they made a female  thor   they are gender bending the heroes. nebula  being a alien and mostly machine parts at this point  could  transgender  to a guy and they expect us to be ok with it. not saying aliens have to have a gender  but its an established character. why would you alter her gender
the nebula in the right looks like billy corgan.
i m so glad that you are in a better space now.
respect subscribed
glad to see you looking perkier again  keep going kiddo.
i loved the gotg movies  but i can t in good conscience go to the theater to watch their recent cinematic abominations. the poster you mention in the video just gives off a major red flag.
it s not even a good man s body  so true
i dont keep up with the marvel universe. im just wondering how they bring back gamora  as long as they don t give nebula a mans body on screen  i ll be happy
that pose the nebula as is weird its a  look at me  i m a hot woman pose   whilst being completely unattractive to anybody.
doesn t have to do with nebula or the decline of masculinity  but they completely changed groot. looks like he is on steroids now
wow marvel dose it again by making me care less and less about what is upcoming from them.
downgrades  people  downgrades. - phineas t. ratchet
so they re making nebula a transgender  i never really felt like a woman. but thanos instilled in me this idea that i was.... but now i ve realized i never was a woman to begin with.  -nebula  probably
well she is almost all machine so she could just replaced her female body parts for male parts  so she is a trans cyborg or something i don t know  i m a little bit confused at the moment.
@  ss                       meloniemacgoboom  sus...
it hurts my soul. i really like redheads. she s a gold star among them. this should be illegal.
to be fair nebula was never shown to be feminine.first  shes bald.second  shes an aggressive  rough  fighter.not exactly feminine traits
i am with you. and they want to over with the feminine characteristics  like is if you were a true woman  you are boring as a hero and a uninteresting character. you need to be masculine  to be emotionless  to be unstoppable to be a badass  super inteligente  better than every men ...... i m tired of all this
there you are  al laughs and loud again! you re strong and beautiful  let noone defeat you!
no one gonna point out how them depicting a young girl who was surgically mutilated by her abusive father as an  lgbt icon  could really backfire on them
they did everyone dirty on this poster. kraglin s got a gut now  that looking back through previous sean gunn kraglin pictures was not there before.
disney pretends that they want transsexuals to relate to nebula. but alotta people could relate to each character in the first gotg. including a raccoon
she telling the truth whats good will be evil. and what evil will be good
you re awesome!
i don t know. it looks like everybody got that or a similar treatment. i don t think this is something to worry about as of yet.
what about quinn  chris pratt has been steadily improving his physique over the years  but the poster makes him look emaciated and weak
is that sushi on your shirt  yummy   going to eat it tonight and now i am extra excited
yeah everything they do isn t even surprising anymore. went from  wtf  to  of course they did .
melanie looks so cwute   cozy snuggly in her blanky jacket today hope u get well soon
well  looks like i m not watching the new guardians movie.
they made all female guardians androgynous  and cgi d pratt into looking like he never went to a gym  at least on the poster.
nebula s gone full sam smith! never go full sam smith
they want to confuse us.
speaking as a naturally androgynous woman id die to look more feminine  and the way that  peak  femininity is pushed today doesnt help  really makes you hyper focus on areas you lack the most over areas you look fine and should use to your advantagehonestly i think a lot of character designers are women and men with severe image issues and where it gets pushed out so much nowadays its just normal to take this stuff as normal nowi dunno weird times we live in man
i said something similar to julia but i was like i cant claim your son s from this other world i had seen at walmart
if they actually make nebula trans  there is no way i m seeing this movie. she was actually one of the characters i really like.
the worst part about this  aside from the obvious erasure of the character s feminine traits  is that they didn t even have the decency to make her look physically imposing or impressive... she looks like she walked straight out of a balenciaga shoot  in which every woman is made to resemble having a scrawny teenage boy s physique.
8 03 the even tried to cover up drax s curfs
there s no reason for this. it s demonic.
f  were karen gillian  i would be so angry.
changing a character s gender changes the entire character because a character s masculine or feminine traits can make or break your character. when you develop a character  stick with the originality to keep your audience on a track rather than a roller coaster changing the characteristics.
thanks for the warframe beta key i still play to this day. xd
it looks like billy corgan from the smashing pumpkins doing cosplay.
i ve never understood defending the choices done with a film by appealing solely to in-universe decisions  particularly if the choice is bad. the story only happens a particular way because it was written that way. the film itself justifies nothing. it is a collection of decisions being made by its creators. in-story justifications don t make the writers any less responsible for what they choose to put into a particular film.
nebula can t gain weight anyways... she is a cyborg lol....
that s unfortunate if they re going to push some trans or body positivity thing with nebula.  i was hoping vol. 3 would be good...not that i was going to see it since i stopped going to see movies or paying to see them like  three years ago  but i enjoyed the first two and the holiday special and i wanted to see a good third film be made.
it s more of a boys body than a dude who has gone through puberty. while karen gillian isn t overly voluptuous  she still has a nice hourglass shape.
nebula looking like yondu
new nebula looks so awkward in the new poster  like her arm is raised as though she is scratching her head at her own confusion  making her stomach protrude and chest so flat    i love og lara croft as well and i will never acknowledge any new modern takes on real female heroes!
she now looks like a purple norman bates.
i do agree about the religious aspect of this. it is getting harder and harder to avoid coming to the conclusion that there is something anti-bible in all of this.
i love it when melonie mac rips the rotten guts of out of corporate disney s fun genocidal money data gouging racket machine. she s a true to life hero.
just watched a video how soft foods and breathing through your mouth can effect things like jaw structure but also mental health.  sounds caveman but eating foods you have to chew  not fast food  might be sokme of that correlation there
yeah  she does look really bad.  i have no desire to watch this anyway  i basically ignored the mcu movies after endgame ruined things for me  the hulk was just so lame in that thing.anyway yeah they really don t want us to like women anymore do they   when you mention the the whole formless blob idea  i think that s what you said  it reminded me of an old episode of doctor who from the 70s  genesis of the daleks  and how daleks are basically weird squid like things inside of big metal containers.  i often think that s the goal of woke culture in general  if not literally then symbolically  that s what they want us to be!!!
turns out she looses her body in the film and has her head put on a man s body as part of the plot lol
hi melanie  i hope you are doing well and are happy and are enjoying video games
i think this last iteration of gog is going to be horrendous woke as hell its been the theme that marvel has taken.
austin powers  that ain t no woman! it s a man  man!
passsss on anything james gunn makes
that s clearly not nebula on the poster that s some guy. the only thing they have that looks similar is their color pattern. if they are doing this to the poster just image what they are going to do to the movie. this is a bad sign for the movie.
whatever that thing is you re wearing  it s very kawaii.also  i agree turning a total hottie into a nutritionally challenged male is definitely  develry.
guardians 3 could really be dragged down if starlord chris pratt is belittled by gamora and nebula and it messes up the chemistry the guardians have.i know gamora is from an alternate timeline but if their is subversive  mean spirited feminism masked by nebula and gamora having a femistic contempt for starlord it could really hurt the movie.
is that one of those oversized hoodies  my woman just asked me for one
i don t know why you popped up on me feed  but the second you said  i m a christian   i slammed that sub and like so fast i threw my phone. quite a refreshing perspective on this otherwise disturbing platform!
we ll thank god it s the last one lol
i agree with what you say. femininity on women is not something that should be removed. as with men s masculinity. they want to be progressive but instead  cause more harm.as a sims 4 player  i ve been constantly seeing players  adult players  demanding more inclusion and representation. constantly.  oh add this  add that! when are we gonna get this!  more representation!  like  stop! instead of asking representation  let these people work on improving the game first. but no  people have to push for stuff that modders have already made for them to enjoy. not everyone cares about inclusion and just wants to enjoy the game. like for example  they added a  sexuality  function when sims were already ahead of it s time with sexuality. letting you do whatever you want with them however you see fit and form the stories you want. but these adult children demanded for it  made the devs waste time on something that wasn t needed   because sexuality in the game is however you wish it to be  time that could have been used to improve the game  instead used for brownie points. the game has always been inclusive  but they keep demanding for more and more and more and they don t stop. i would love for a puertorican inspired setting pack anything  instead of being just bundled up and generalized in the latino hispanic stuff  but i understand not everyone cares for it.
1 03  i have found that i ve become much more compliant since i began the 100  soy diet.  much happier...  i love big brother  he is my hero!!!
marvel did a body swap in black widow too
found your channel randomly and you re great. way to start clump for women. hope your stalker pays dearly
rip drax.
if you have a gaming computer. try returnal on pc. amazing. bought release day on ps5 and now pc.  the pc version quintuplicated and quadruled an alreeady awesome game.
tbh  i m more pissed off at what they did to my boi groot. he s just baby groot again  but thick. they just ignored his anatomy and evolution just so we can have thick baby groot. with no story explanation whatsover. gotg was the last good mcu property  and they still managed to ruin it.
i m glad i stopped watching on no way home
hardly matters. the mcu pretty much concluded with endgame  with a few spider-man movies as epilogue  and that s it.
idk but i m the trailer it says the main villain is changing people to fit his ideals maybe this happens to nebula
a self reproducing being with masculinity trails could fit that idea of a perfect society.
i can speak for every man here in the comments..your thought process is really attracting..
at times  god will place challenges in our lives that seem unfair and insurmountable.  but rest assured that he only presents obstacles that  through relying on him  you can overcome and will become a stronger person through the process.  hang in there and god bless!
from femme fatale  who actually scares tf out of you   to a meh unappealing thing  it says nothing
she s a cyborg so it could easily be explained by her original body being destroyed and only having a male body to use but the message behind that story choice is clearly pro trans given the current cultural climate.
taking away karen gillan s glorious hair was bad enough  but this......
happy to see a fellow christian making youtube content.
you are a very powerful woman.
gillian is a stunning lady   and the artist who created this should be punched in the face every day for the rest of their life
i don t understand why so many people are freaking out about this poster. it s the guardians of the galaxy. it s james gunn. its in the marvel multi-verse. it has to be their extra-dimensional counterparts. it s a wacky gag. it has to be. why does no one seem to be recognizing this
i d only ever pirate a disney movie going forward
i absolutely hate the woke movement and all but isn t nebula a cyborg android  she would be able to easily replace entire sections of her body at a mechanic or workshop.
i feel like eventually it s all gonna switch  and feminist and woke activist are gonna completely have dad bods and say that is feminine and attractive
nebulosa is now nebuloso wtf
okay the figure of baphomet has a lot of iconography on it. secondly the figure of batman has absolutely no lore whatsoever on it. it is purely and idle or an icon.
at first glance i thought it was yondu udonta.
guardians is so damn different than the comics. made jax a walking l taker when he literally killed thanos in one of the comic runs. they always make the buffer masculine guys absolute morons in movies lately. just like chris hemsworth in ghostbusters and so many other examples
came here from a critical drinker live stream  you fit in great with that group! instant sub
lol i thought abby was the trans character in tlou 2 because of how manly abby looked in the trailers lol.
i like my female characters to be clearly feminine and my male characters to be clearly masculine.masculinity and femininity are gifts to be treasured  and mentally ill creatives are trying to corrupt and crush them.
it s very obvious  it s not her body it was definitely  photo shopped.
the thanos killer was classic drax. they changed him into modern drax before the mcu so it isn t quite the mcu s fault there
@talentroller 44  annihilation drax isnt like the movies either. hes strong  stoic and basically a genius
thats an insult
@lingr icen  and why would that be
that poster looks like it was quickly thrown together on someone s laptop to advertise a cosplay fan project. that placeholder nebubba  i refuse to believe that is karen gillan  would look low effort even if that was just some random guy doing a nebula crossplay. as a product of a professional marketing campaign it just looks cheap  sloppy  lazy  and off-model.
so they destroyed gotg as well - guess i ll just call it done with the christmas special then. like totally mcu done since it s all just in the toilet now anyway.
disney is driving at a cliff and their only reaction is to speed up.
just to be sure. you know that nebula  karen gillan is laying down in the poster  the man looks like it could be the character kraglin played by sean gunn.
old wise saying   tell me what you eat and i will tell you what your are.
everyone should be free to express themselves in any way that makes them feel comfortable and confident. just because someone gets to be themselves doesn t mean anything is being taken away from you. because a woman can be masculine doesn t mean women who want to be feminine aren t allowed to do that.people keep making up  war on x  to promote outrage politics.
if you re right about the baphomet worship connection  it s kind of inconsistent messaging.  because  even baphomet has a nice rack!  lolbaphomet isn t exactly androgynous.  the deity has both attributes of male and female as opposed to none.  having no gender defining characteristics is androgyny.
why did that full guardians pic look like cosplayers and not the real characters
not only has nebula taken the shape of a biker dude  but anatomically she dosent looks correct - the right shoulder is way off. the overarm looks like it dosent connect properly to the shoulder and the shoulder is to low to lineup properly to the torso. her hole body is unbalanced. this is an artistic mistake a freshmen would do.
based melonie!
from the trailer her character doesn t seem badly written and the actor is putting good effort in but this is definitely a woke to be woke bullshit move.
amazing how one image can cost a movie one billion dollars. nobodys going to want to go see the new movie   guardians of the genderverse
karen gillan should be offended by this.
marvel had nebula jumped on the trans-trender train.video game wise  look at horizon zero dawn. they intentionally created the character to be ugly  and boyish. they made her purposely unattractive  and knowing that they did that  irked me to no end. it pretty much made me pass up playing it. i refuse to play a character that looks like they live on potatoe chips and mayo milkshakes  then got hit in the face with a shovel a few dozen times. nope  my istaphobic self is not having any of it. two of the best things i ever did was  not watching tv  or eating soy. that s the victimization double punch. btw  imo  the attack is on humanity as a whole. every agenda  at it s core  is anti-human. the ones that can t see that by now  have already lost the war. it s great to know there are others that see it to.
well with how they put a girls face on a guys body in woke widow  i am not suprised with seeing karen gillans face on a guys body.
oh crap  was planning on seeing it. guess i will put it into the other woke garbage i won t spend money on.
stop giving disney marvel the benefit of the doubt  with the recent movies and what s been in the press the past couple years you should know what they re about. don t be surprised if nebula identifies as a guy during this movie.  i loved the character arc she went through in the guardians movies  and the connections she made in endgame with the avengers. her acting without any dialogue in the opening scenes of endgame really showed how she changed. really disappointed with what disney marvel is implying with this poster. chris pratt losing muscle mass just another knock-on masculinity. disney marvel does not deserve our money or our support.
no  the one laying down is gamora.
doesnt she get a new body because of something that happens  maybe that s why it looks that way we just havnt seen the story yet to find out that is whats up
i thought gotg was a great movie. then the second one came out and i wasn t so thrilled  i kind of lost interest in the series after that. so this news isn t a big deal to me  i wasn t going to watch it anyways. the entire marvel dc comic movies have run their course and need to be put out to pasture  or they ll just be whipping a dead horse. the wokeness is the nail in the coffin...
uh... why is her elbow a knife
to think that this is coming from disney  a company that has turned the mcu into a weapon against misogyny. i would say that this is quite misogynistic  defeminizing a strong female character. i swear disney s method of politics leaves me confused.actually  when i think about it further  i imagine that there could be an interesting  albeit comical story behind why she has a different body  however  i m willing to bet that they added such a spoiler to the poster to get people talking.
me at 3 00   makes same face that sal vulcano makes when he sees his sister in any video concocted by any of the other tenderloins impractical jokers
men can be sisters too!
first lola bunny  rouge the bat and now this  they de-sexualized our great female characters do they not want feminity worst than removing namor s schlong  i ll take nami one piece  looks over nebula s.
karen gillan is listed as being in 3 not that it would stop disney from messing up the character.  i sure hope not...hopefully just a bad poster.
if they bring any transgender crap into this to explain nebula s change  marvel will have completely lost me  at least until deadpool 3 . i ve skipped all of 2022  since multiverse of madness   but the one hope i ve had for marvel to come around is in guardians 3. with this poster though  i might just have to throw my hands up and completely abandon the last hope that can be had for the m-she-u. i ll wait to see her in the trailer  but it doesn t look good.
i like how they ruined the coolest looking character in the guardians franchise  now she looks like a cybernetic hillbilly
they did the same with she hulk in the comics and gave her a manly body similar to hulk and that as so wrong. she hulk use to be a smart hot woman but the modern comics and the mcu destroyed that.
10 06 she hulk acted as if there were no custom suits ever until her friend found that super suit fashion designer . even though jen could literally go to any other custom taylor for a fricken suit!!! god that show fucking sucks!!!
great video  mel.
it always sucks to see good takes like this covered by the veil of religion.
look at groot who has an androgynous body normally and is now bulky.
who makes that shirt omg it looks comphy i wanna order one
i wouldn t be surprised if guardians 3 isnt quite as good as the first two.i could very well be totally wrong but all this woke influence that seems to be super imposed on every marvel movie that comes out these days it s quite possible that guardians 3 will have some unnecessary wokeness too.nebula looking like a woman who transitioned to a man is a red flag  but i will keep my fingers crossed that it won t be woke.it doesn t matter that nebula is a cyborg this is pandering to trans people it looks like to me.
i guess after endgame all the new movies they have really been showing us their endgame with these dark woke agendas
as usual  woke disney catering to the trans cult. - from  her  comics bio  nebula is an athletic woman  and an excellent armed and unarmed combatant. she possesses a gifted intellect and is a brilliant battle strategist . but now of course disney had to make her gender neutral to please the crazies that probably won t even watch the movie. she looks a lot different  i had to check imdb the other day after seeing the new trailer just to see if it was still the same actress.
i like to try and put myself in the mind of a reactionary bigot  and figure out why i d get so butt-hurt and snowflakey over a film poster  but still doesn t really make sense
don t anyone mess with my nebula karen gillan that is terrible. i wonder how she feels about it and to be honest we won t know as she will never admit it if she wants to keeping working. anyway we still have the real actress and character in the movie.......for now.................... i am not the age to put posters on my wall anymore but a gotg poster without the real nebula i dont want to see again
everyone  did this simpleton type  me   in his own comment
as a white male  i m saddened by this attack on women and femininity that s been building behind the scenes but is now out in full force.  i don t want to see a hybrid female male it they whatever. i m sure that there s about 3  of the human population that does  but i ll pass. nebula was my favorite character. sigh
the comments on twitter are annoying.  sorry the blue robot isn t sexy she is part cyborg. she is a woman who was taken apart tortured and pieced together.
you mention being called a homo transphobic.  i ve always disliked that term  because it is fundamentally inaccurate.  someone that chooses not to like a homo transsexual is not necessarily fearful of one  as the word would insinuate.  someone that dislikes spiders in their house is not called an arachnophobic  they dislike spiders.
no  you re not crazy. read the book the return of gods by jonathan cahn.  this book goes into detail about the gay trans movement. it explains its origins and the spirits behind it.
1 58 why the pooch close the door  xd
the thing that also baffles me is the number of idiots in the comment section of that very post on twitter that defended the new look of nebula. countless losers saying  she s not real  or  that first poster is heavily edited  that isn t her true body . its ridiculous. what they keep doing to female characters is such a crock. video games  comics  movies  etc. its all bull crap.
bye nebula.... welcome nebule
i m an atheist  so i don t necessarily believe in god or the devil  but i will say this. i don t have to believe in those things to think there is still a spiritual battle because there are people who do believe and worship the devil. even if they don t  they have to be aware of what he means and what he represents.
while i do agree with 95  of what you re saying  i gotta disagree with soy. soy doesn t affect testosterone. it s plant based and while it s true that it helps women with estrogen  the estrogen in soy doesn t affect men. the estrogen found in beef does affect men. it just so happens that the  soy boys  are  boys   not so much the soy. dietary difference aside  i agree that it s a damn shame nebula couldn t stay feminine. i m not one hoping for disney s demise  i m hoping they finally realize that woke   broke and start producing quality media again.
they might pull a oh they came from another multiverse
as always  i m cool with any type of person in media. but this is obvious pandering. most of these characters end up being flat  stereoryped  and their entire personality is whatever minority group they re pandering to.  i am trans  is not a character.  i am gay  shouldn t be the focal point. let characters exist and develop within an actual well written story.
well apparently nebula was getting her old body updated  which was supposed to go to esterous 5 but mistakenly  went to testoserous 3. disney marvel glitch so they gave her a loaner body from androgynous 9  since they are hurting for cash gave her the gimp body number 17. accidents do happen when making such fun films and occasional other glitches in the algorithm from their cccp overlords made from cheap spare parts super dumper computer. with a minorly massively modified through slave labor programmers a.i.  made with malate software. so see it all works out through the clouded fog of the stoners smoke and crack pipe smoke infested atmosphere once known as the marvel writers room.
while i don t disagree at all that nebula looks...off  i m not 100  sure that s a dude body. it s ugly and hideous that s for sure. mantis looks ok. not amazing or what i d expect but looks ok. gamora is way off. put her in armor if you want to cover her up. making her look like an auto mechanic makes no sense.
as a point  i am unsubscribing to anyone who covers this. it is low-hanging fruit and not even remotely accurate as the  busty  photo circulating around of nebula isn t even real. it even comically boosts her chest 3-4x what it actually is. something anyone who has watched a guardians movie would know. never mind the fact that karen gillan isn t busty  to begin with  and when you get a tall lady with a small bust in a simple shirt stretched out  yes  it will not be flattering. this is dumb and shows the community really is scraping the bottom of the barrel for content. i know it is a slow time on yt during this time of year but there has to be a line.
they all look really lost on the poster  i hope it s not another miss
i really don t care about identity politics. in fact i d rather it be non old white male. just to prove there is no difference. yes  when the gender is changed and race it is normally for liberal reasons. yet  hollywood has always been that way and i never heard people focus on it before.hollyweird has an italian wave a australian wave a jew wave... the late seventies had numerous classic black hits. example velma. you all only looked at the color. it was mostly a very witty show. name a white show that could get away with milk pump  i ll wait. the head left hates babies and especially milk pump and breast feeding. and as far as the lesbian theme she at the end always referred back to fred trying to get the goat of daphne. once daphne and fred hit puberty i wouldn t worry about them.
maybe because she is a cyborg. and those are parts and not an actual body. lol
how can someone who s is obviously very intelligent and has very aware mentalities also believe in the magic world of christianity
you re free to believe whatever you want when it comes to religion but trying to make everything religion does lose people. as an atheist  i start losing interest when people constantly make everything religious in one way or another. when you re part of the culture war  you want to reach and draw in as many people as possible and constantly talking religion is not the way to do it. it turns people off and you end up doing nothing but creating your own bubble that will accomplish nothing.
there is a recent saying that asks if you want to know who runs the world then know who you aren t allowed to talk about. there is a massive rabbit hole that explains everything that is happening. following now.
i mean they pussified thor for the last 3 outings he had  infinity war  endgame and love and thunder  so that rubbed off on the guardians of the galaxy in one form or other.
she transitioned over the christmas special !
bruh  she mentioned being a christian twice. relax.
i guess nebula is a twink now
i can finally cosplay! skinny fat beer belly dad bod ! hahaha
austin powers voice  that s not a woman that s a man baby .
oh  they better explain this because where are nebulas beautiful curves !!!!
totally off topic here  but i need to know where you got your happy sushi hoodie!
did we get a timeline change or did they forget it was a girl
good vid. you are awesome. i m in your corner.
amazon  it s a blanket robe hoodie
bro aint no way
100  truth.
karen is in a different country most the time isnt she
maybe this is the real reason why bautista wants out of the mcu
what the hell are they doing to these characters
nah bro  you are not crazy.
these fools will never make me think a fit hot feminine shaped woman is not the best thing for a man to want
the actress said on tiktok it s just a weird pose
sh t like this makes me think they re just baiting us to notice because they can  so they have an excuse to victimise themselves. we re dealing w  actual children. so tiring.
she looks like a slightly-skinnier version of billy corgan
you re hoodie is adorable.
5 10god damn it  melonie...
agreed
i enjoyed the robo woman she was a cool character i liked her just the way she was  stop changing shit whyyyuh
nebula looks like me now...bald head and all...
i always thought nebula was kinda hot even tho she was bald w shark eyes . she was still somewhat feminine. wtf man
there does seem to be a definite trend against overly curvy or big breasted women in particular as apparently according to feminists women dont ever have big breasts
i would ask james gunn then why his wife got an augmentation job if he thinks this is such a good thing.
thanos  one last fu gift to the universe  beer-bellied soy boy nebula.
looks like i m skipping this one too
that s a  chicken  man body
the best women are basically men.  modern feminism
my oodie has pizza slices on it.
brilliant vid.
i wouldn t be surprised if they meant to do that to make it seem like nebula is somewhat trans
now nebula is a they them
because.....agenda       secretsociety
oh dear   i enjoyed guardians 1 and 2 and was looking forward too guardians 3 but my excitement has litteraly just dropped to zero  lmao what jn the holey fck
that s a maaan  baby!
even the head  huge dome  brow ridge
defund and dismantle disney.  walt would be rolling over in they s grave.
it s aloy from horizon all over again.
feel better mel
any little amount of interest i had in watching this movie is now gone. they all look like they re ready to chill at home during a winter storm and veg  not go out on adventures and save the galaxy! the only ones that look like they wanna be there are the cg characters.
welp that sucksi love karen gillan!
they don t want the male gaze or the female one.
is this really anti-decadence to prevent a age of decadency.
and i thought disney wanted strong female characters!  no all they want is more money...... however! a little part of me says they re doing this on purpose for media coverage
y all still gon watch it though
my group actually thought she was pregnant. considering your take is more likely true. i won t be watching the volume 3. i hate this kind of stuff and won t support it.
maybe they used deep fake
such a waste  that actress  is absolutely drop dead gorgeous  way to go disney.
not gonna be surprised if they explain it away with her living her truth  and becoming male  by having some  upgrades  done.
excellent. marvel saving me money again! i dont watch woke. end of lol.
maybe the actress was pregnant when shooting started and they may have gone with an infiltration as a dude arc.but the timing is awful.
watch them try to  not so subtly  make this about being non binary or trans in the movie.
what keeps baffling me with all this unfolding is... after all the metoo  strong women etc etc... they are so deadset on erasing women... or femininity.
maybe it s just the poster and nebula in the film doesn t look like that.
looks like axle rose just before the first breakup.
i can t help imagine her flashing armpit hair
we all know what this is...
you had a point until you mentioned demons...
mantis and gamora don t look al that feminine either in that poster.
also  for the santa truth. here s a good way to state it.ppl need to learn that ppl can believe what they want  one owns opinion doesn t change the fact  that they re openly flauting it right now.for hollyweird to be santanic  you don t even need to be christian to realize that  and you also don t have to believe it  so that they can believe it.this is the problem here  i as an agnostic can clearly see that they use all the signs and symbols.for all we know  they could only be doing it  cause santa loves that carmic retribution  which makes it easier for them to do the evil stuff.they could easily be believin it  so that they can be immoral  and feel above enough to keep up the act.ppl are simply not ready for this talk.even when someone lie the weekend  can have santa flash on a giant ass screen behind him  hidden in a way  that you can only catch it with the right cam.and no matter what you believe in  you should never be the friend to the bad guy in a story  even if you despise the oposition  you can always take your own position  and if there is a final judgement  you can simply tell the big light  that it simply was a terrible way to write it in a book  that for all we know  could ve also been stolen  bruned  and exchanged with one that isn t as believable  because they rewrote all the knowledge into parabels  that often have the moral value  hidden away under layers of confusion.if a being like that would ve want us to have the perfect compass  it would need no book  it would be inscripted into your mind.and  the light made us who we are  or else there would be no end time talk. if you don t account for every variable  you can t predict a thing like that. and before you think i use this as an agnostic excuse  i don t  i m just good hearted because i enjoy the world like that. do i use the word as a sword  you betch your ass i do.words are here so that we can escape physical and financial violence  the two violences which make us mentally  and spiritually weak.what do i mean  bullying. you can t bully someone with only words. following someone to harass them  is already making it physical. even the act of stopping you in place  and removing your agency to move away  is making it physical.so here s that for public education  which you can t escape  or they will put you in foster care.there s many layers of nuance  if god would ve wanted me to follow a book  he should ve wrote one which is so unmissunderstabdable  that there would be no spiritually charged violence  and we had that for every book of those kinds.yeah  i m talking off my high horse as an upcoming author  but it do be this way  simple as that.either carve my moral compass into my mind  or you failed at the task. but i m pretty certain  that this is where the actual scripture is hidden  this the one reason why i m agnostic  deep down i feel that there s layers and guides in my mind  that keep me on track  when i need it .
nubula as tomb raider
i just wish they left roles alone. like instead of changing an already established character into something different make something new. add characters or make something new.
its probably a joke. picture nebulas head and mind on that body. funny  sounds like guardians.
why   we are normalizing degeneracy.  -disney
what did they do to amy  nooooo.
i hope it just a bad photoshop  but it s disney  so who knows.
who knew misogyny could win by pretending to be a girl.
it looks like sean gunn s body... no idea why they d do that... but yeah  it s weird  and not a good weird...
she looks like a once skinny rock singer on a reunion tour
it is just too much at this point
nebula used to be hott
never been to your channel.  like your beliefs and views.  i like your pet!  saw him   in background   will try to watch more of your vids.  if i like  i will sub and tell my friends.  women can be powerful  strong and leaders but not in same way as a man.  they should never sacrifice their feminininity.  when they do  it s not rebellion.  it s silly and robs them if their grace and power
why does nebula look like the dude at the trailer park who sells meth to kids
ngl i think your looking too deep... in the trailer she looks the same  it has nothing to do with modesty or anything like  i think your literally looking too deep... in the trailer you see there curves  this is chill clothes
i thought that was a different actor.
so since nebula is a badass she has to look like a man ok yeah that makes a lot since some world we live in.
sweet!! instead of a beautiful feminine body they made nebula look my truck mechanic!  her outfit just needs the grease stains. who the heck wants to pay money to see that
wth   looks like billy corgan  circa 1995.  lmao
have you seen new movie trailer  the flash
i love lara to.
have a wonderful weekend melanie mac
see she was rebuilt up from scrap and uh well along they way they lost her breasts like just couldnt find where those parts when when rebuilding her
i really want your hoodie!
there are fit men with a more feminine body than the guy playing nebula. and i don t mean girly guys.  i mean like certain boyish looking swimmer or gymnast  athletes that have slim waist and broad shoulders and back.
wtf is happening to our society lately  they are all a bunch of misfits.
i m calling it now.. marvel will botch gaurdians of the galaxy 3. wait for it...
i hate hollywood   i m so happy people are getting fed up .
you re right that it looks like a man... but he s not fat. he s not a body builder. but he s not fat.
nebula transformed... literally
you should have 124 million subs
the new posters and character designs for guardians 3 is a huge turn off for me. not just nebula s design  but all of the character outfits kinda suck  except for maybe groot . i probably wasn t going to see it in theaters anyways  but now i really don t care.
great melonie mac go boom nubla marvel poster
amen sister!
groot looks more feminine than nebula does.
it s taskmaster in black widow all over again. male actor with female character s head cgi d in. i compared it yo some of the in-film shots to see if it was just a bad poster but no  she looks just as bad if not worse.
starlord looks demasculated skinny. wtf
the most attractive characteristics of women are those of motherhood. wide hips  large breasts  soft skin and pleasant demeanor
thats a mans body because for the poster it was a replacement body double.
noooo!!!!!
you gotta be shitting me. as nebula she s a commanding for e to be reckoned with a positive role model for girls  wow they blew it. also peter quill is jacked and buff what s this. i ll be sure to pirate the movie when it comes out to make sure i don t give disney any of my     they don t deserve it
guardians of the galaxy get woke
this video is certified based!
they wanted to make nebula look bougee gay
so it s volume 3  the christmas movie is not cannon
this literally looks like a joke where some dude decided to cosplay as her and photoshop himself in.
and disney thinks that normal people want to see this crap.
you could say the same abut quill. in the poster he looks like he s lost most of his muscle. he s almost looking like a soy boy. and that s definitely not karen gillans body either. what the hell marvel..
i love your hoodie we re you get it and what is it called so i can find one for myself
weep for the culture folks.  it s dying quickly right in front of us.
i had my comment on the weirdness of this poster  skinny star-lord  breastless women  removed without notice or warning in a forum i sometimes go to. that was the last straw for me  it s a woke cesspool now and they don t allow for freedom of speech.
austin powers  that s a man baby!
there are her organs.
wow this video glitched out half way through   went all diagonal with screen tear.  refreshing the page does not fix it o.o
that s a disney  christmas special  not a movie.
look at evangeline lily. now look at her in ant-man 3. look at sasha calle. now look at her in the flash movie trailer.this is not a  conspiracy theory . hollywood hates beautiful women.
subscribed!
umm... because she is not human  she is a cyborg like robocop  she can take any form she wants.
3 14  all the wakandan woman crying xd
i can t find the video about the stalker update where he was taking you to court
maybe the actress wanted to much money
diet does play a role.  i struggle with my weight.
well partly but besides being a little wider in the trailers their s really nothing that points to her changing gender expect the terribly made poster.
put the two recent updates on unlisted for now since he was loving the attention he was getting
gunn has been trying to make up for his un-woke past by going super woke. doesn t bode well for dc.
why is nebula a guy  because it s 2023 and karen gillan is too hot for  modern audiences .
look at drax. no masculinity in the pose. not threatening whatsoever.
could she be pregnant
we all know what they re doing here. they re making her him trans. they re going to use the mostly machine story to explain away that she chose to switch. given the rest of disney s showings over the last 5 years alone  we can pretty much guess what they re going to be doing here. i have better things to waste my time on. hard pass from me.
we ll   now i know what i m not watching
let s hope it whines up being her long-lost brother or something like that and not her turning into a dude it would just hurt marvel even more especially after ant-man 3 just bombed
nebula is now a skinny fat guy lmao
wow that s really weird how is the actress karen gillan ok with this   id be on my agents phone trying make them blow up disney and marvels phones ! this is just awful !
um this was photoshoped to look like this it s not her real body.
here before the james gunn simps ditch the mcu for dc films. the dude is jj abrams lite beer
marvel is at its wits end. it s over for marvel  i m abandoning ship  this ship is the titanic.
i m sure that the original was padded big time because the actress has bee sting breast.  the rest i can t explain.
two things are keeping disney from going bankrupt  merchandise sales of legacy characters and the theme parks. disney  is in bad shape  star wars has nearly been destroyed into irrelevancy  and marvel will soon follow.
i m trying to wrap my head around this soy mentality. i ve eaten plant based for over 2 years  squat 2xbw  bench 1.5xbw  and deadlift 3xbw. never felt stronger and healthier than now and i m in my 40s.
hang in there kiddo.
she ll say she has always been trans. this is disney we re talking about
well  they needed to wedge a t in there somehow.
quit making fun of my body!! lol
cant you tell.... its you they hate .... from the ones that spout the nonsesnse that defends it all the way to the actors actresses that allow it they hate you all . want proof   say 1 thing they dont agree with and see just how fast they want to end everything about you
plants do not have the bioavailable nutrients that animal products do. glad you re ok for now but hopefully if things decline you know when to jump ship. there s a reason why 80  plus vegans don t stay vegan long term. at best plants are a better replacement to processed junk  and that s why you re seeing benefit  but if you ate more meat and eggs and kept the junk out you d get way more nutrients
lol went from strong woman... to weak man
fuckin hell  i was hyped for this movie because it didn t push any woke ideology to the audience but now im facepalming and rolling my eyes  fuck me
why does the body look so badly photoshopped  like it looks like someone who had no idea what they were doing did it.
thats awful because karen gillan is a total hottie
that is some bad photoshop.  how did this get approved
let me guess....nebula  who was mutilated by thanos with zero consent and changed beyond recognition.....is now identifying as  nonbinary  or whatever the alphabet community thinks. isn t that a lovely thing to think about....
i feel like this kinda thing is just a over push back because if they make women to hot they are objectifying women but they made her a man here
transform a nice female character into a man  interesting to make this not look misojinous xd
girls need to look like beautiful  women and boys need to be guys in games and movies
speak up
damn...more like nebulo..
if they turned her into a dude a male a guy i m going to tell you right now i m not going to watch the movie i rather wait till next year and watch joker 2
stop giving disney money!
how dare you assume her gender !welcome to the 2023 clown world.
ne-bro-la
may be the dog will really be a cat next. can we just stop this rebelling against how we are made.
remember when marvel used to be interesting and your always looking forward to seeing a new character would also make things more interesting. but after endgame i lost all trust in marvel and now i hope it crumbles to the ground go woke go broke lol
she robot tho
the mcu has repeatedly disappointed me since endgame.
the actress has always been very slim. when i saw the trailer  i noticed she looked a little different and it threw me off. not to be mean  but i think she gained a little weight in her face and midsection which can happen as a person ages. wish she had used the time between movies to workout and gain a tad bit of muscle tho. love the actress tho!
noooo dude wtf is this ! ! why
it s not just marvel that s the issue  it s james gunn. these people are creeps  demonic. there actions show as much. let s wait and see how the dce plays out not that he s in charge... i think it ll be horrible  and i haven t and won t spend a cent since endgame. won t support it
why are you surprised just laugh it off cause its not gonna get any better hogwarts barmaid has a mans voice
you re right about soy fr
so cute  in that
she transitioned lol
or maybe that is how her body looks now...deal with it
didn t watch the new black panther  not watching quantumania  and i wont be watching this one either. it sucks because i m a huge marvel fan  but i just can t handle the agendas anymore. i can t remember the last time a movie came out that was actually worth the money spent on the ticket.
they photoshopped drax s body onto her as a laugh.edit she s a man now  that doesn t look good at all.    and starlord doesn t look any better
good ol  hollywood erasing women one character at a time.
the truth is hard to hear.
nebula is now transgender.
mastectomy scars in games for kids is warped. women have been told to be masculine for a while  its empowering so they attest.
yep
tbf read let himself go also
lets ruin everything  i just kinda want to either have my castle up in the mountains or flying home or a big ass space ship and get the hell off this planet.
she looks like a woman in every scene she s in from the trailers. it s just this one poster that she looks weird in. can we maybe wait for the movie to come out before we jump to conclusions
this is why i quit watching moives anyways.
people need to make a stand and refuse to watch these movies. only when we vote with our wallets will things change. disney is hemorrhaging money and no matter how much they have  money talks.
because race and or gender swapping is more important than having a fan base.
hey that looks like my dad bod  p
you just have to look at the one line at the bottom  once more with feeling.  and you can guess what kind of woke garbage this will be.
i can t get into gaming any more.  there are hardly any characters in games that cater to me.majority of games now where aliens or bad guys need to be killed... the protagonists are women.  that s not to say women can t or don t want to fight.  but in reality if aliens invaded and they need to be defeated  i will be doing the fighting.  i will want my wife and young child to hide in a cave somewhere.  i will be the one doing the fighting.yet game after game  new titles  heroines are almost always females that don t look feminine.  it s always a mean looking angry woman with short hair that s doing the fighting.  she is fighting masculine men since they re the aggressor.there was a racing game that recently came out.  the character you play is a female racer.  your mortal enemy is an obnoxious straight while male.  he treats you like crap and doesn t believe in you.  you know who your racing manager is   a black guy.  so a black guy is saving the oppressed female from a white male aggressor.  i m so sick of this shit.i have a good gaming pc and i thirst for good games to play.  i just find myself replaying older games that don t have a bullshit woke agenda.
nebuman
is there a checklist  like  black man  check. transgender  check. lgbt  inclusion  check. political plot points  check. perfect movie is coming guys!
maybe it s a gag. she is striking a ridiculous pose
nobula.
nebula is a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
when woke goes too far.
marvel has just lost its marbles. exactly what they did to the comics  to wreck the comics  is now what they re doing to the film franchise.
she s pregnant   why are you body shaming her   just grow up girl
she got a dad bod
okbut why are u in bathrobe
leaha was hot and great
you know its bad when women complains too
are you kidding me nebula is my favorite one  they always gotta kill it
yup
haven t watched a single movie from the mcu ever since end game. to me they are done since going full on woke.
theory 1  nebula body gets destroyed and her head gets put in the quickest thing they can findtheory 2  nebula become a transgender man after star lord comments about her eyes her father gave her being pretty. star lord continues pursuing a physical relationship with her anyway for this last film and no one will call chris pratt a transphobe ever again.
your side by side example was fan art. very obviously so.c mon now.
b.b.b.b.but nebula was angry... and gruff.. one could see these as masculine traits no  therefore! she must be a man  o!!.. that seems to be an ever increasing logic we see everywhere...
in marvel  there are no accidents. if it could be woke propaganda  it is woke propaganda.
yup that is not nebula she is not a dude lmao.
it s to do with disney s re-entry into china. ccp does not want revealing or overly feminine women.
this is abby version 2...
you may get to this but look where the belt is sitting. that s where me and every other normal man wears his belt that is not where a woman wears her belt
amen!!
i m out. i have so little trust left for marvel. i just can t be bothered to see vol 3 in theaters
i don t think any of them look flattering. it s not really a cool looking poster.
im sorry shes not making senseshe s saying there s an attack on femininity and they dinero want girls to have curves  like why  who is doing the attack
...but  what is a woman  who can say...
they gave a hot girl a soyboy bod and why does groot now look like a muppet
nope those are both official images
nebula got the operation.marvel after endgame  2022 through 2023  sucks.i was a ounce a marvel fan not anymore i don t care anymore for marvel.welcome back melonie  you are beautiful.
the bible is extremely  woke.   i did a whole podcast episode about it.
apex legends has a trap character who has voice lines about children and how theyre the 1 your parents warned you about.so cringey my back snapped
there has been a war on women by male marvel fans.
as a mcu and karen gillan fan  i have to say this...  wtf !  what the hell is james gunn playing at    is he deliberately trying to ruin nebula  nebula is one of my favourite mcu characters and i hoped someday she would get her own solo movie. nebula having a man s body really doesn t feel right and feels out of place. it s not nebula. not nebula at all.
michelle obama approves this message.
when the tanks roll in  who is going to man the barricades   chad or soy boy   china hopes it s the latter.
well now im not watching it.
tbh i don t think its good to bring religion into this. actually i was pretty confused when you did that. religion is never a good reason to judge anything  because it s about believe not knowledge.
of course nebula is going to try and be a dude now.  can t wait to see her space arm wrestle  light a fart on fire  burp in someones face  and start a bar fight over being misgendered.  from this guys perspective she looks better in the original costume and i would smash that.  laura crafts character is screwed in whatever new direction that goes.  just a guess  she won t use guns because they scary death machines.  death by spear impalement is still good though.
manula
if true  not going to see it
shes the first trans mcu character
this is a male nebula. she s gotten top surgery. it s woke to the extreme and so effing offensive!! marvel can create new androgynous characters. but leave the characters we love alone! just how far will disney go  this is disgusting!
yeah  i m gonna skip this movie.
that nebula makes me want to throw up in the back of my mouth
looks photoshopped.
i hate this stuff being in games to i wish there was something i could do but no one cares about my opinion . i was playing a older assassins creed game and the men look like men and the women look like women it was so nice. i think i ve decided i m going to stop buying new games for a while and just play old stuff. hopefully they will stop doing this kinda stuff.
i ve basically stopped watching marvel movies entirely.  this will just keep me away.
chris pratt doesn t look right either. he has far more shoulder size than that.
draxerman
hi miss macster.
dood!
now i can t go see it! they are ruining marvel!
can we go back to the 2009-2015 timeline when the left was just dumb about money
folks  walk away from disney. keep your kids away from disney.
i feel bad for chris pratt. he s a christian working in hollywood. i d rather be an atheist in afghanistan.
for the  last     finale  time....   if you can t switch your d.n.a. ...you...can...not...transform... your...gender.
bet nebula has a trans pride side story in this movie....
why  it makes no sense to do this to such a beautiful woman! if it wasn t bad enough that disney have been emasculating all their male characters in favour of strong female characters but now they re making said sfc look like dudes      what is going on  i use to buy all the marvel movies on blu ray  the last one i bought was spiderman far from home!!! the quality of the films and tv shows has fallen so far to what it use to be  it really is quite disheartening.
even her face looks more masculine somehow. it s bad
damn  i think the actress is hella cute and this dude is hella gay.
that sucks  dude. guardians of the galaxy is literally my favorite of all the comic book films. no bs. why do they have to ruin everything  is nothing saved  reeeeeeeeeeeee
can you talk about fortnite change all female skins to no curves and breast female skin characters is changing into men and all the men characters have some kind of pink in their clothes and female clothes now they change our flag colors by saying red   brite   blue they so woke now
if nebula is a dude now i m good. i was excited this may have been the last good marvel movie  but i m good on that. also should scare dc fans as well. james gunn is in charge  after he finished this. smh.
i had a bit of hope for this movie since it s the only sequel i was interested in  but if they try to push for any shitty politics i m out. i have not been watching any marvel related stuff since endgame anyway.
you re not wrong at all. just take one look at how pathetic our military is compared to 5 years ago.
i m so exhausted by this shit.
she is technically trans now gotta get with the times.
i guess you dont get the meaning of woke  like all these people that over use it this much
this movie    looks to woke for me i m going to skip it
wtf  karen gillian is one of the sexiest women in the world. wtf would they do this  hollywood is sick.
so much for female representation
im going to laugh if this was just done for comedic effect on the cover art. and yall are just overreacting
kudos marvel. you somehow managed to make karen gillan look unattractive.
your voice sounds so much better. less froggy
lol
another mcu movie to not go see.
that s a trans nebula
it s a lot of bad photoshop in this poster and nebula is worst. the body looks awfull  the person used to make the basic photo was a man and the nebula head is copied badly  not centered  on the body.
sigh...
reason i quit watching mcu and anything that is related to disney or hollywood
glad i lost it for these kind of movies after end game because i would be heated over this the nebula in the past guardians was feminine and hot but right now real femininity and masculinity is being erased and combined together to look like the baphomet.
they also changed the original actress for ant-man quantumania jus because the new one was more popular  insted of worrying about continuity. this is just a poor excuse to insert transgenders into something like guardians of the galaxy that is totally unrelated to their struggles.
it s sad that disney did this to the characters. i m not a fan of all the agenda being forced  even though we all see the money they re losing. sorry woke people  not for me and i m a christian too  so no thanks to all the garbage woke trash.
ngl  i haven t payed attention to super hero bullshit movies in a long time... movies these days are a joke anyways  also i honestly don t know why they would change the body like that
but nebula is a cyborg  she can modify her body  okay but why would she want that body!  even if nebula switched to a male body  why pick such soyboy body  it is not strong neither handsome.
stop working out girls  ya doin feminine wrong  apparently.
i realy did like her as a character i do not like this
they just hate the fans  period. and they hate all legacy characters - especially white  male ones.
scary ugly  why   i am about to check out of anything marvel.
this is an insult to karen gillan honestly   she is so pretty and thats not her body  for marvel to be showing her like this  id be insulted if i looked like a girl in something that i am working on  or let alone that  if the cameras added weight on me id be mad too  instead of glow ups with cgi this is what they do  definitely woke agenda   i dont see any other reason
good for you mel. don t allow anyone to tell you what s what. turning nebula into a dude  nope. i m done. but you gained a  new subscriber.
so  basically you want to replace one delusion with another. the whole  satanic  schtick is ridiculous.
how does a cyborg get fat  . whatever.
i m sick of the mcu to be honest  so even if they made a great movie i still wouldn t get excited
i just want the women look like women  and not look like guys !
they are gonna try to explain it away.  she has a robot body doesn t she   yea no thanks lol when wokeness is obvious im out  dont need to go to a movie thats gonna call me a bigot in theaters if i go  and a bigot at home if i don t lol.
when are they going to stop this nonsense  i m going back to watch physical 100 and their more direct representation of  right wing  i.e. fit   men and women.
i dont  know why would you see women as powerful when she is just beautiful   like i would think the women needs to be smart as heck and there for comes the power as she is able to talk a big talk and people will take tips on the talk. what is there any power in a women when she is only just beautiful   we have a name for that and it s bimbo
nebula s facial features have changed significantly too  much less feminine  especially around the eyebrows.what are they gonna do  make the character trans now jesus i hate this.
play the game or learn who adam warlock is before asking stupid questions melanie
i have been with comic book movies for a while and i am just so sick of this shit. i don t want the modern worlds sentiments to touch the fiction i grew up with. who wants that
you are all missing the real reason. it s pretty obvious to me. they want a reason to get rid of chris pratt. if he dares comment on this subject he will get lambasted again.
if there s woke politics in guardians 3 i won t watch it. loved the first two movies but i m so done with our entertainment and all the politics i don t agree with shoved in it
groot looks so gross when are they finally gonna bring back lanky tall normal groot already godamnnn
wouldn t this be considered body shaming
dont assume  theys  gender lolololo
the facial structure is male as well
the f ck
apparently to be empowering as a woman.. you just need to actually be a dude
that is not a beer body. your perception of people is crazy if that s what you actually think. i love you and this channel but if you actually think that s a beer body that s insane. the stomach is completely flat.
disney and their woke agenda have screwed up both marvel and star wars.
look sick this sad
i expected some exaggeration. nope. thats a dude lol
what have they done to nebula   is nebula now a trans woke activist
i think i m going to pass on this one. marvel has been awful lately and it looks like this one will push  the message  .
i m just going to stop watching all new movies until they stop this garbage already.
karen gillian gained weight.  mystery solved.
it s weird  i ll wait for the reviews before paying to go to the theatre.marvel movies have been garbage for a while now anyways.
why did they make her look like a man    because eventually they ll make her trans. guaranteed. it will be part of her struggle. i m not going to edit this comments so you see i m right.
it s a weirrrrrrd poster.
this is so disappointing.   i enjoyed the guardians movies.  they were fun  and let you suspend disbelief just enough to really get into it.  this just destroys all of that.  when i see a movie  it s to escape this kind of bs  not have more of it shoved down my throat.  i will not be buying a ticket for this one.
i guess disney hasnt learned yet  the last year of marvell films have all been horrible.. and this poster is literally showing each new stereotype..star lord  is the  stupid man  and all the women lo longer look like women. i guess the twitter fans will like it... too bad they arent the ones that are going to see these movies.to me it looks like another movie i can choose to save my money on.
well  i thought they made a switchero between the characters heads and bodies in order to be funny  but it s not the case. and even without religion and using just with common sense  logic and science   actual authentic science  .....this is bananas  dthat aside....this is one of the worst  roughest and laziest-made posters i have ever seen. feels like it was made by amateurs who just learned photoshopeven my 6 years old can make a better poster than that  d
show dog
watch the fourth age s  why peogressives turn women into men . he explains that very good
i was done with marvel after infinity wars movie that was the last decent move or series s they put out and on hollywood the only movie i watched was top gun maverick haven t watched another new movie since.if they want a transgender character make a new one and leave the old characters alone ..
that s exactly what i am thinking
people look so deep into things and try so hard to be mad about pointless shit to the point that they are pissed off that a blue android woman doesn t have tits in a marvel movie.
she is a trans naw  and we all should respect her feelings .
while i agree  i find this view a bit disingenuous coming from a woman wearing a snuggie like outfit.
we live in bizarro times where men are women and women are men
cosmo happens to be soviet russian.  way too push the russia war machine agenda marvel.  boycott time   i d rather watch a sonic 3.
triggered much lol
because he identifies a woman of course
i always say  best way to fight this  is if you dont pay for this shit. dont pay to see it  dont pay to play it. it will disappear. every purchase is an automatic  1 like meaning you want more of this crap. your negative opinion afterwards is irrelevant af.
powerful women  margaret thatcher  angela merkel. power can be derived from many facets. looks really help though.
my establishment is proudly soy free. even developed soy free  legume free tofu so that i can gi e vegans at least a little more nutrition.
it s awful.
push against masculinitymakes most women look like mendisney logic..
bruh
stop all swapping and make new characters
when you know your bible  the evil is so obvious to see. that is why we warned about the slippery slope years ago.
are you giving away ps5 and macbooks
she has gunns body. glad i don t waste my time with mcu anymore trash
this is so fcked up. i will definitely skip this movie too.
another franchise ruined it.
marvel died with iron man
another fail then
pride is satan s favorite sin.ezekiel 28 13-17
another movie i won t be paying for let alone watch the garbage.
wow. you re really pretty!
no  don t fall for obvious scammers lol
lol you are goodfun chatterbox.  to let the world be  hmm. yet will they let us be and respect our differences   i got abit ptsd tbh. they cant call it hate speech when really its just speech they hate. fakes like fakes. people pleaser buddy collectors. why is this childrens comic show chap posing like this wtf so gay. no offense nothing personals. im feeling better now  back to my simple cabin in the bushes aah so peaceful omg . theres a waterfall and glow worms. but recent cyclone wreaked havoc the stream is now 3 meters higher full of silt and sludge. your anger is a gift. dont let them steal your forthright joy. its tactics of psychological warfare. to destroy very meanings of things. more important than bullets and bombs.
amy pond is very flat chested.  hips a little too slim  though.
god made man in his image  and now men are trying to make women in theirs. the human race is ending itself.
yea it looks horrible. no one wants this ! this isn t going to win new fans lol
i agree with most of it except the whole christian and baphomet shit the only reason they depict baphomet like that is to make fun of prior religions whose gods or myths had characters like that just like the depiction of the devil the pitchfork and horns and goat feet are a mishmash of greek mythological figures poseidons trident and the goat features aka pan the satyr just a reminder that chrstianity all of it s tales which is what the entire religion is a mishmash of tales from prior religions i would suggest looking up all the other demigods who resurrected after 3 days and did miracles and had 12 apostles which there were many thousands of years before this jesus fellow.
welp  good job marvel  you just ruined another great franchise.  i will not be watching this mess. i m tired of this woke ideology. disney  why you do this.
i m sorry my brother had to disagree one part of your video i don t agree with the trans ideology but if dylan wants to walk up to me with a rose and asked if i would be their valentine i would give him a hug and say yes with as much love as i would from my own children .
1 in 21 in 2 women will develop cancer in their lifetime  many will become bald from radiation treatment. get well soon.
marvel s doing this stupid thing where women can no longer look like women. they can t be attractive. have you seen wasp s frodo baggins haircut
what makes men strong  women.
are you guys secretly marketing this stuff just so people will hate watch them. that s a good capitalist strategy.
machine bodied characters are soft targets for turning trans.
the mcu is dead. i haven t watched any since endgame.
great they are going to ruin guardians now too.  remember the old days when you could sit down and watch a movie the wasn t shoving woke bs down your throat
so messed up  man!.....and people still support this trash company......bewildering...........
another movie i won t see. quite changing people i m watching a movie not some kind of movement your wasting money just don t make the movie.
anyone ever notice the far cry series have never had any 10 10 s  all of the women look so dull.
virtue signaling is crap.is it the same actress playing the character but with chest bindings or did they just go full woke on this    this movie is gonna be crap. crap.
no offence but that soy boy thing is nonsense. there is more estrogen in cow s milk than there is in soya milk. it s just a stupid stereotype that harms people who have allergies.
cry about it
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
transgenders of the galaxy
marvel is so gross  honestly shame on you if you still give disney money
looks like a guy making a bad cosplay just for fun!
just more men telling women what they can and can t do.   women are second class citizens again as we been pushed aside for more special people so we gott o learn our place and obey men even if they say they are a woman.
i assume it s going to be trans propaganda
reeeee reeeeeee reeeeeee!how dare you body shame nebula. i m so f cking sick of woke culture  it s destroyed every form of entertainment.
i m tired of the lgbtq agenda. just keep the movie and characters like it is. nebula is kinda hot too
honestly who still watches any disney trash  pretty inexcusable if you do.
this movie looks awful  i don t blame gunn for leaving marvel  screw marvel  dcu is going to be much better  i heard flaky crap about antman 3  marvels looks like a joke  and now this garbage  marvel go home you re drunk. i m just looking forward to deapool 3 and blade  all the other stuff looks like trash.
more of the same from the mcu. women are so great that they are better at being men .. except they can t
i m glad i stopped watching this shit. these movies really aren t that good. theres a few  but that s about it. hollywood disgusts me.
have you heard about the lgbtq bible
i hate disney mcu.  they ruin everything.
of course they re doing this... james gunn likes little boys!!!  that s why quill is a queer now...  tell me i m wrong...
don t mind the scoffers and mockers dick masterson was talking mad shit about you and he lost my support  and you gained it. he was kinda funny but he is now defending satanism and it just cringe. stay based.
what a load of drivel
she s not and it s disturbing that you re so shameless in promoting a false narrative.
theres probably some comedy behind it when we watch the movie. like she had to swap her body with a dad bod or something. it might not be something so nefarious as trying to get rid of femininity.
marvel s trans propaganda
don t really care about gotg 3. another woke marvel crap!
if u think that s a guy who let himself go type of body then i question what u think is average  that is an average male body structure.
im guessing they made quill a bit queer with thor cause of starlord being bi in the comics now  i mean at least a quill x thor ship makes a bit sense cause both had gone through the same situation lately but i m glad they re friends now  i do love the moment where quill gets excited over thor s speech
