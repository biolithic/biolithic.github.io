even in the first live movie  april wasn t sexually objectified out of context in any way whatsoever  but she was still hot
how does april look more like a ninja turtle than the actual ninja turtles lmao
ryan kinel also brought this up. yourself  az  drinker  the quartering and others are bringing to light this disturbing trend of de-beautifying women promoting obesity and obsession with race. hat s off to you melonie  keep up your commentaries!
talking about the  hips and bust  of a child
i remember reading a few years ago april was modeled after one of the creators ex girlfriends who was an italian woman. why not make her italian  when i see that april i don t see april i see a race swapped irma. irma was april s best friend in the original cartoon  and she was portrayed as the velma type nerdy girl. they could ve included irma in this movie and made that her look instead of turning april into irma.
she s supposed to be a babe. literally  in the first movie  one of the turtles   she s a babe!  lol.
it s great to have you back! i hope you enjoyed your weekend. i couldn t agree more with what you re saying. i hate what they did april and i hate what hollywood s message for women. make women beautiful again!
another great take  the reality is  people have nostalgia  and want to see their favorite characters continue to be that into the future. if they had not done this sort of thing in recent nostalgic works  people would not care as much  but the reality is  it has been done too often to not get on people s nerves.
i am much more offended by the fact they made her as blatantly unattractive as they could get away with in an animated film than by the fact that they race-swapped herthough  speaking as a black man  they really shouldn t have race-swapped  uglified  or de-aged her. as good as the nickelodeon cgi series was  i think it was a grave mistake making april much younger than she s always been
i was confused when i see this because most often you can tell when something is ugly like ugly sonic. for example  the reason why he was ugly is because he was too realistic to the point that he becomes weird and uncannyapril in this version i don t see any problem with it. listen my motto on any change that is directed to a character physical or otherwise is that the changes have to be a parent for example april tmnt-rise   people were mad that april was race-swapped but when you watch the show  you realize that she is a completely separate character from the normal april that we know that s why i think if you re gonna change something about a character at least make them different enough to the point that they stand by themselves because if you can t do that then it just looks like april but with a different coat of paint or with a different body type to appeal the masses and get woke points i always believe that the point of april was to be a outsider for the ninja turtles to interact with not to be eye-candy for them or for the audience i feel like it s really rude to put the only girl character in the show movie s to just be eye candy for the mainly male casts to look at april does not need to be beautiful or stereotypically feminine  it s fine if april is those two things  but we shouldn t limit the character to just being those two things the character has potential to be a great friend to the ninja turtles in an actual character of her own these movies and shows are different universe is from one another  tmnt-2012 is a different universe from tmnt-rise things are different from both universes different villains  but similar stories happen. i feel like the fandom needs to stop looking at the series like it s one big continuing story  there are different universe that we should all appreciate no matter how much problematic that they may be  art does not follow rules and like hell that it follows the  beauty standard   the tmnt was made in the damn 80s come on let it be its own thing for a while
the boy styled haircut in the comics was largely due to sophie campbell who really wokified the comics after kevin finished his 100 issue arc. that design is all sophie and i was so glad to see her go back.
one really bad thing i just realized  is that if they return her to her original look people will start screaming racism and fatphobia  she might never be able to be actual april again. it s already happened with other characters that were race swapped and then went back.
this might be an improvement--hear me out if she s heavy  she ll be harder to kidnap and she ll be so insufferable due to her race change  using velma as a standard  the footclan will be deterred from kidnapping her more than once.
i think a lot of this has to do with the  male gaze   where we can t have attractive looking women on screen because many of the writers are either chubby chasers or people with low self esteem due to their own appearance  so they force their standards onto the rest of us. given chance i wouldn t doubt something like this would be pulled on a character like lady jaye because in gi joe she was the subject of fan service in cartoon.
who else agrees that this is the best melonie s hair has ever looked
this is definitely insane.  i ve been a fan of the teenage mutant ninja turtles for years and i absolutely hated that trailer  for many different reasons.  april was definitely one of them  but then again this isn t really april.pushing the velma look  new velma anyway  is really unhealthy like you said  but yeah seth rogen isn t someone i m a fan of  ever since he ruined green hornet  so i knew this was going to be bad when i heard he was involved!!!
my instant response to seeing her was  what the heck is that   and i m also being further justified in my theory that they always target gingers for race changes. it s seriously a strange choice.
april in this movie is one of two things that bother me about this. i would have to get used to donnie s voice. ever since nickelodeon bought the rights for tmnt  they literally make april a kid anymore. i miss those days where she played the big sister for them. who was there whenever they needed a place to go to when the shredder was after them  april!
the april from the first tmnt movie was average beauty for the times.  but  she is supposed to be attractive because she s a reporter on tv.  and don t tell me people on tv aren t supposed to be attractive  if not they wouldn t have them wear makeup and wardrobe.
when i first saw this version of april it felt like my eyes were on firealso to answer your question on why they do this to a beloved characters is in fact they hate her  they hate attractive women they re like neil druckman on hating attractive video game women
bring back meghan fox haha.
they can t stop doing it.every new show must race  gender  and body swap their characters.it can t be about the original show  let s woke !
yup. loved judith hoag as april o  neil  and still do especially with her being an tmnt fan in real life.
@mike c  i mean between men sexualizing cleavage and religious conservatives and islamics saying cleavage and low cut shirts are literally killing our society its kind of a lose lose here sometimes.
original cartoon as well  she wear an effin jumpsuit but she s beautiful.
u just contradicted yourself
paige turco was prettier.
she was smart and quirky  they made her sexy through personality where it counts  the fact that she looked hot only added to the charm
@mike c  no i don t mean cleavage  she wasn t scantily clad at all. she gets hit on by casey a bunch of times and that s it.
she definitely looks like an ooze mutant.
i see they finally brought back venus after all these years.
april fly
lmao you nailed it!!
i m dead lmfaoo

i can t breathe
we shall call her half squat
@kuggacourage gx  no i didn t  if i find someone attractive  i find someone attractive. i don t need to see half of their  cartoon  fictional character  flesh to make it so.
@hakkon shima.  yeah but those sequels were not that good
@infamyordeath -__-  i agree
@bruce leeds  then your comment was pointless then
@kuggacourage gx  how...
@infamyordeath -__-  i never thought i would agree with this but at this point yes bring her back!
@adu1991  i recall she addressed tmnt fans not too long ago on social media. she still looks good
@budgie cat  yup!
i mean  it d be fine if she wasn t april  and april sent in a friend  unattractive people can exist   to help out the turtles in her place.with some april cameos on tv or something.
@cherrygrabber  looks closer to irma
@cherrygrabber  or make new characters like for example the black guy from the original tmnt cartoon or make a asian female.
i heard that the reason why their keep on changing the tmntis because their in the same universe with batman and supermanthis has nothing to do with anything i m just saying
lmao  you just won the internet!
why did you think their so attracted to her
so true raph looks so submissive n leo so undisciplined
@harshitkumar1315 tbf they are supposed to be around 14 in the movie
lmaooo!!!!
she looks like bebop.
perfect!
@tiago santos

roflmao
i was in the military when the first movie came out.  i remember a packed base theatre with a cross section of the base personnel from recruits on saturday.  we were one big happy laughing and singing tribe regardless of our skin color at that moment.   not this divisive woke garbage i m seeing these days.
ow brutal
teenage mutant ninja turtle
melonie looks more like april than that.also the new turtles are very inclusive after the last ronin.also they re stereotyping black american women.
she looks like velma mindy
ha  that was the first thing i thought of too... i wasn t even looking at the race  unless we re talking human. visual entertainment has to visually be appealing.
how she looks like one
@thatharvguy  how
she s their long lost sister.
lol
bruh i wonder how is she gonna fit in the sewers
damn  facts.
notice how they keep  uglifying  female characters but they leave male characters  superman  batman  etc  intact as attractive  tight-fitting costumes  sometimes with a bulge in the crotch  hmmm  it s almost like there s a double standard at work here...
because that s how black women look like.ps  joking. hollywoke hates good looking women regardless or race or gender.
lol i wasn t the only one who thought of that. for real! i can visualize her with a shell. she probably is a human turtle hybrid mutant.
best comment
yknow they actually could ve made her look like gwen stacy i mean they even did the spider verse style so why not   right
@butt3rz  i don t they got any for the first time in their lives
i see this on facebook  and for the first time i guess what will happen.
bruh in the original she was actually black
@justnico  no she wasn t what are you talking about i own the original she was white.
@dysfunctionalbubble  yeah they intended not to be good and give us the worst character version not the best version like what the hell they thinking  this is movie not a cartoon show in a low price franchise. mutant ninja turtle is very big franchise and this the worst version they has. bruh woke mentally really nerf everyone even themselves not just men and women  even any character they include.
damn
everybody know april is white we saw  original tv  show and  the cheesy movie  from   1989  and we played the  video game  mutant  ninja turtles
@amador cortinas  oh yeah sorry but how can i tell if you do own the tmnt
@amador cortinas  and also  you don t even own it. it was made by a mirage studios or something lol
dat b ray sees n shieeet bruh!!!
april moomoo
@like a dragon  yakuza series generation official dumb
so accurate lol. best comment.
bruh lol
@edward bernard  you ain t the target audience  grunt.
bruhhhh hahahaha
god damn  this is the most interaction i ve ever had on a post. lmao
same question i asked
true
so black people look like turtles.....
@v-way  stop misconstruding this for a racist remark...
hahahaha hilarious comment!!!
this is the diabetic april.
exactly!  i think april broke the step behind her!
@edward bernard  yea man that s what i m saying i m def not racist n i m glad colored actors are getting more recognition in the acting community but to ruin the original stuff from my childhood that i grew up with cuz just because it s the woke era n if they made her white n skinny like the original they would cry white supremacy it s just sad. if their gonna remake or reboot a series they should stay true to its roots but this woke stuff is getting out of hand. its one thing when the woke movement was about women being abused and police brutality against colored people but now they include everything under the sun n call it woke n if u don t agree u get cancelled. this def isn t the country i grew up in and as someone who loved movies n comics as a kid back when it wasn t cool to like that stuff i hate how they have to include the characters just to fill a quota especially disney stuff how every leading superhero or strong character now has to be a woman or it s considered toxic masculinity n misogyny lol
@grim scraggletag  that s not entirely true just look at disney everything they put out now has strong n good looking female characters from rey  ashoka played by rosario dawson  bo katan and her side kick played by sasha banks from wwe  and a bunch of other characters from star wars movies n shows and just look at marvel they prob have more female superheros n characters than male u got captain marvel  new black panther  jane foster was the new thor for a movie  valkerie  pepper potts literally ran tony stark s companies n got her own ironman suit  they made aunt may young n hot when she s always been really old  america chavez from doctor strange 2  they even had a female loki on the tv show n she was cute asf  scarlett witch  they had scarlett johansson who s one of the cutest actress today as black widow  gamorra  nebula who even thought she s bald in the movies is played by an incredibly beautiful actress  n dc u got wonder woman n theres a bunch more n that s just star wars n marvel there s a huge list of strong beautiful women in movies in this woke era because if they do have to many leading male strong characters everyone cry s toxic masculinity n misogynist. so in fact ur argument is kinda backwards. that used to be the case but there s obviously been a shift in the other direction
same shit we get in black panther. masculine looking women

she mutated throughout the years. literally. lol
rippa also debunked the screen rant article that said she was always depicted originally as black.
@frostfang7  rippa s a quality commentator.
@p. whitestrake  screen rant tried to do some revisionist history
so. being realistic is bad
@kuggacourage gx  because beautiful people aren t real
someone is targeting redheads for some reason.
@rodiusmaximus  yeah so move on
@kuggacourage gx  maybe in your world.
@theninjamarmot they really are. they are trying to erase them from our cultural fiction for some reason.
@frostfang7 rippa is wrong  she was based off of one of the creators x girlfriend and or wife  she was a mixed  biracial woman  which is how she was originally depicted  the toy companies pressured the creators so that they could sale toys.
then angry joe commented and......lol
@elijah hayes  idk about that
@kuggacourage gx  you re one of those people who thinks disabled characters need to be played by disabled actors  aren t you  martin lawrence or eddie murphy wearing a fat suit is ok  but brandon fraser is not allowed for some reason.
unattractive people exist  it d be fine if she wasn t named april or is her friend who has the same name.with april cameos on tv  i d welcome a new character.
@cherrygrabber  wtf
@rodiusmaximus  wait  so what about the whale wasn t brendan wearing a fat suit
@syndrome  i m actually not quite sure what your question even means. are you saying that wasn t a suit  i was saying that there is an unfair criticism of the whale. brendan got slammed for it. but the same didn t happen when martin lawrence did big momma s house  or eddie murphy did the nutty professor. maybe that s because twitter didn t exist back then  or maybe society has grown soft  or maybe it s just pure hypocrisy on the part of the critics.
@rodiusmaximus  i was asking if brendan was wearing a fat suit because i was making sure i didn t take your comment out of context.
@syndrome  oh well  i haven t seen the movie  but i watched some reviews. could be cgi  i m fairly certain he didn t put on weight for the role.
@kuggacourage gx   beautiful women don t exist when you spend too much time on twitter and only fans
the same happened to nebula in the guardians of the galaxy poster. but looking at all of these designs in the show  it looks like they didn t give the designers enough time to decide on a good one  or fix them  which i don t think is that surprising considering how marvel and other companies have been with their workers  rushing them.
@cherrygrabber  they could ve made her a version of sunita  who is aprils best friend in rise.
@rodiusmaximus  oh i didn t see it either so i m assuming it might be a suit as actually making him get obese for the role would be extremely unhealthy and could even put fraser in the hospital. christian bale starving himself to look malnourished for the machinist is one thing because then all you need to do is just eat enough when you re done and the consequences wouldn t be so bad either. getting extremely obese though is not ok because it could risk clogged arteries  stroke or heart attacks not to mention it s way harder to lose weight then gaining it.
@hafizi hilmi bin abdul halim
@rodiusmaximus  are... you implying that the beautiful people are the oppressed
@dboot 888  i don t know what you re smoking  but you ll have to point to where i said any such thing. did you mean to tag someone else
y all complaining that a little girl isn t hot attractive girl drink some water
like they literally just need to let her grow up
ong like who gaf  why can t people find better things to complain about
truth about irma .. i said this about rise april but that fits new april even more
april was irish  right
her girlfriend was mixed black.
maybe...they ll add another character  named irma  that looks exactly like the original april that i d like to see!
@bruce lombardo of dix division  yep
that would get complaints too so i don t know why you d bother suggesting that either.
@magcargoman  i was being facetious.the comic relief making really stupid comments to leviate the situation is a common enough story telling trope   .
@magnus j nsson   i was replying to guy that started this comments chain  not to what you said.
says who
well tmnt always had a beauty and the beast character dynamic with april and the turtles.  it was a fun contrast having a pretty lady running around with monster turtles in the sewers.  i guess you can remove that and make it ugly and the beast but you lose that dynamic.
@animezilla 44  michaelangelo.
@animezilla 44  literally anyone who grew up watching the show in the 80 s.
@shoddoplis  i disagree the dynamic was mostly family
@sven boi  not everybody grew up in the 80s cartoon i grew up with the 2003 series the april was very different incarnation
@animezilla 44 between april and the turtles   no it wasn t.
@shoddoplis  if you watch the 2003 and 2012 cgi series april o neil relationship with the turtles was family
@animezilla 44  and in the og comic  the movie and the 80s cartoon it wasn t.  they were friends mostly.and besides they still do a contrast of normal pretty girl befriending mutant monsters even in the 2000s era cartoons so it still starts out with the same dynamic.
@shade draws - sinr studios  whatever
@animezilla 44  it has always been both beauty and family. beautiful family. duh.
@animezilla 44  you mention the 2012 cgi series as example of april o neil s relationship with the turtles as family despite the fact that donatello was infatuated with april o neil from the very first episode that and sometimes she encourages his behavior by giving donny a kiss on the cheek. i mean unless if you consider that kind of behavior  family  go off i guess.
@hideo freaking kojima  2012 april o neil did give donatello a kiss the cheek but it was never applied  she was going to be he s girlfriend granted it was odd
@animezilla 44  you forget donnie had a crush with april in the 2012 tmnt and was bumping heads with casey jones over her.
@vic 2.0  michelangelo .
every character is ugly in this art style but in a good way. i think it s just the style.
@ashes2ashley  nope.
@patrick dixon  the bar guys are fugly  hog and rino are somehow more atrocious then their original design  splinter is in that weird gen z disco stage  and somehow the only non weird looking character designs are the turtles. kinda poetic.
@ashes2ashley  it s unoriginal.
@patrick dixon  no remake is. but they re actual teenagers now! it s cute.   hope it s as funny as i think it is.
@ashes2ashley  stop being a pervert. everybody is copying into the spider-verse now.
@patrick dixon
thank you so much  andrew!  _
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
tru
@andrew robb  i think all women  of shapes and sizes are beautiful in their own way do they all have to be sexy supermodels no they don t do they. i think people from both sides are arguing really forgot what truly means to be beautiful
as someone that grew up with 3 cousins  always hanging out  studying martial arts for 10 years   we gravitated towards tmnt of all eras  80 s animation  original comics in black and white  and live action movies  and nearly every animated series after. you cannot change things without opinions from fans.
reality is it s fan fiction nothing more  why do you and everyone else care about fan fiction   if you feel nostalgic watch the originals.
yea melonie is pretty based
@enalb  what s that supposed to mean
@cj gamer  that she is biased.
animation looks great but that race swap destroys it.
@cloudspottv  april has always been race swapped this is nothing new
@cj gamer  but that s not something what we need to accept. why dont write new character for black community  why always white and only white character are race swapped  if they care enough to race swap her in first place they need to have their goal to achieve by this.
@cloudspottv  april was originally supposed to be a black woman who s friends with the turtles and splinter but the writers decided to race swapped her and make her white instead
nostalgia is kind of bad though  movies trying too hard to play off nostalgia is considered fan service which is a main criticism of many entries in series that bring back a lot of nostalgic characters and moments just in an desperate attempt to get approval from older fans.
@shade draws - sinr studios  you know nothing about the turtles history april was originally black in the first tmnt comic book her design was based on kevin eastman s girlfriend april fisher who just happens to be a black womanno one is stealing culture here april was originally black but they race swapped her for the 1987 tmnt cartoon
then watch the original series if you want nostalgia this is for a new generation of children not 40 year old weirdos crying over a side character not being  hot enough   mfr s crying over nothing i swear  been a super fan over 30 years and this looks like the best thing to happen to the turtles since 2003. i hope it kicks shell and the kids love it enough we get a sequel or spin-off series.
@comicphreak  wrong  she was originally white. look it up kid
@comicphreak  wrong.
@comicphreak  not his wife  someone he was dating. get your facts right
i would have been fine with a beyonce like april . if its part of the character and they dont make a big thing about it lol
@comicphreak  dude  this all kinds of wrong. eric july debunked this.
@comicphreak  no  she was irish mainly with maybe a hint of asian   thats the mixed part  the name is based of his ex girlfriend whom he may have married
@comicphreak   what are you  20  dude  i was there in 1987 and watched that show religiously. she was a pretty redheaded white woman.
she was race swapped in the latest nickelodeon cartoon
@blazer  hes right laird always envisioned her white ginger
@comicphreak  that s a common urban myth that s been thoroughly debunked. eric july just put out a video on that.
i know right it s ridiculous
facts
even the race swapping is annoying  especially when the entire entertainment industry is suddenly doing this every chance they get. it s becoming ridiculously predictable at this point  they are trying to turn every historically white character black  why can t they just leave them be and add a new black character into the show. it s like they re doing this on purpose to try to raise the racism levels. they want white people to feel attacked and black people to feel like you re racist if that makes you feel attacked by that.just like when obama was the puppet in chief  they used it to inflame racism as much as possible. they act like they are against racism while claiming everything is racism  drastically raising the levels of racism and division. all part of the plan to keep us divided and easier to control. they know this stuff isn t all racist  they just trick the masses into believing it to create racism that wasn t even there before  at least nowhere near the extreme levels they re trying to raise it to.
it s the social justice fugly stick.  it s called  body positivity .
@comicphreak  even if that was true  it isn t  april has been established as a white redhead for years. this is absolutely blatant.
@comicphreak  that s not true. the design was never based on his then partner  just her name was. they did consider making her asian at first  but they went with the caucasian look involving the 80 s  perm hair in the original comics.
i remember being bored by the cgi series it came on when i was a teen and starting to become bored with modern new cartoons.apparently its one of the best now.i don t know i grew up liking the 80s films and 2003 show.
@comicphreak  the modern liberal equivalent of saying  velma was always lesbian.  ya ll stop rewriting history.
@comicphreak  she wasn t really dark or an ugly nerd
she s now the 5th turtle
@comicphreak  named after not modeled after.
@comicphreak watch rippa s recent livestream you ll learn a thing or two.
@mr. smith lolheads up  the new turtles are very inclusive after the last ronin story.
@blazer  liar
the original co creator of tmnt flat out said april was a white woman of irish scottish descent. he named her april after his girlfriend at the time who was mixed race. she was potentially going to be asian during the development phase but was scrapped. nickelodeon made her teenager because they didn t like the idea of an adult woman hanging around teenage males.
couldn t agree more brother
they had to uglify her otherwise men could still find her cute  that s a no-no.
@blazer  don t bother  clows like that one will keep repeating the same bs hoping people will believe it.
@comicphreak  i think she was black in comic books bro not the cartoon
@comicphreak  dude  i grew up with this franchise. she was always white. always. until recently. she was never anything else before more recent versions
do you not know a whole tmnt show had a black april and nobody died or got mad because it s a nothing burger
@comicphreak  i think that was a rumor but i think this rave swap issue ppl on all sides is getting ridiculous. cause no one had that same energy for nick fury
@sterlingk art  not anybetter
@main source  from where
@main source  lol  how many times can people get this wrong  the name is based on a black lady the creator knew. watch eric july s video on it and get informed.
@grizzledcroc  yeah  kiddo  do you not know in what times we live now  what the real intention behind the swap is  oh  and if you indeed have lived under a rock this whole time  welcome to modern day.
@comicphreak  nope  she was named after a mixed race woman but concept art depicted her as asian before they put her on the page as a white woman with a perm!
@josh johnson  no she was a white woman with a perm  her boss baxter stockman was clearly african american and april s skin tone was significantly different!
@kuggacourage gx  because that nick fury was based on 1610 nick fury who was introduced as an african american version of nick  who s not the same guy and they later canonized him with nick fury jr marcus johnson who is the son of the original fury!
@grizzledcroc  nice try.
@ethan henrichs  they also claim poison ivy has always been a lesbian  too...even though she d been in love with batman until she got the lgbt treatment starting with  no man s land  circa 1999 2000. they know full well these are bad retcons.
@henry gambles  anyone that knows tmnt know that baxter was black i wasn t talking about him bro  but according to black nerd comedy she was raced swap back in the comics backs so i m sure
@henry gambles  that isn t an excuse tho
april was based off of one of the creators girlfriends who was a woman of color.
agreed also got black in me i prefer white april
facts.. april being older puts her out of reach romantically from the teenage turtles . they got crushes and that s where it ends . also she was a mother figure because they don t have a mother .. and that completes the family unit... that breaks when april is made a teenager and that whole romance with donatello and casey weakened that unit... and wasn t a good look on april
@haterator  you mean young rippa  no he didnt i watch all his videos and thats not what he said
@haterator  ok yes she was named after a mixed girl but she was white
@blazer  lol. no she wasn t. april has always been mixed. the white version is not april. maybe read the actual comics before opening your mouth.
@laurathered  lmao. the animated show white washed april. the original comic she was not white.
@main source  she was named  not designed  after a black woman. dude  watch rippa s video  he has the receipts and literally shows the quote of the creator in the video.
@mister generation  yet. the turtles still had a crush on her many times while they were still called  teenage  when they are adults
@josh johnson  i know although apparently he was supposed to be white originally but since he was put to page as a black man  he should remain a black man and since the same is true of april being a white redhead  i apply the same logic to her but he and april are different skin tones also that guy is wrong about a lot of shit  i wouldn t trust his take on it  listen to eric july besides eastman or laird or both  said she s white  being a redhead with scottish or irish descent  so word of god triumphs all claims to the matter also april herself in the comic was talking about her perm!
@kuggacourage gx  tf  do you mean by that  she was introduced as white  ergo april o neil is a white woman  i don t see what s so hard to understand  imagine if they cast ryan gosling as t challa again t challa not casper cole  after chadwick passed  we d all be going  no t challa is the king of an african nation  he s been portrayed as black through out every appearence he s ever made in media!  same shit applies the other way arround!
@reid mason  ah yes  she was so always a lesbian trying to flirt and kiss batman and manipulate others! honestly i don t have a problem with ivy using her sexuality as a tool over others and doesn t really have any attachment either way but it should be applied to both men and women though primarily men because she s definitely heterosexual  and shown that she doesn t love them but just uses them  ivy is a villain so humanizing her is a bad idea sure we shouldn t be killing the planet but murdering others to get that point across will take away the effectiveness of that point and others will only ever view ivy as a bioterrorist
@cereal killer  maybe do your research before spreading false information. she has always been white with red hair.
@henry gambles  good point  i think they are on to something
@blazer  i mean i m just saying i was born in  01 and i know what perms are!
@henry gambles   ah gotcha  thanks for the info i don t check out the tmnt comics as i do with the movies or tv shows i think the only time i saw that april was black was on rise of the tmnt  good show  so i m not as aware of the comic book accurately as i am with the shows   movies
@josh johnson  yeah no worries man! i m referring to laird and eastman original run from mirage  check out it though i will say it s much more violent and gory than the turtles usually are!  edit for instance the turtles killed shredder in his first appearance and leo later beheads the shredder in their rematch!
@kuggacourage gx  lol how
@henry gambles  wtf u mean how
@kuggacourage gx  how which part  if you re talking about how she is a racial stereotype  have you ever seen the film precious
as a black man  okay chuck
@cool ass dudeman  it s actually racist that they made her black  because she was originally white. cope
@comicphreak  so wrong. issue 2 and 3 white the next appearance she got a perm. the cover was based on the girlfriend who is mixed race but white appearance aka light skinned. april was never black until the most rise of the tmnt. even the rpg book she is white with a trace of crosshatch or shading unlike baxter stockman who you can tell is black because how he is shaded and inked.
@haterator  im in agreement  i used to own quite a few of the og east man and laird issues  im 45 ugghh  but my memory was hazy  however rippa brought it all back
they race-swapped her  seriously
@cool ass dudeman  true. like these ppl cold bring the argument at first if they are good faith. but these bad faith actors high jacking the message and ruined the meaning of it
@carlos reid  lol  she was not even a journalist in quite a number of versions. also  originally  she wa afroamerican. so white redhead is a race switch. i also think whole new movie would focus on outsiders theme  so beauty would not fit.
if you are an og you would know april is white april is a reporter not some chubby teenager
@dog man  she isn t chubby. also where is that same energy for the other april s who were teenagers also weren t reporters too  just admit yall are mad cause she is black
@kuggacourage gx  buddy i m not mad about her being black.
@anthony m  exactly. finally someone gets it
@dog man  yet yall are
she literally is not ugly
@jasmin tea  yeah. she isnt
@ashley york  did you miss the part where i was also upset that they made her younger   i think that was the biggest mistake that the 2012 series made with her character nice libel  though
@comicphreak  do your research again
@sterlingk art  one time  when i took out a black girl out. she got my car towed! and didn t even care! learned my lesson.
@blazer  bruh the creator based april off his wife who was mixed do your research some more
definitely agree man
@blazer  this doesn even make sense since her first version was blk
@sycrosd4  libel. wat are u even sayinvat this point
let him cook
exactly. i also feel like people are just calling her ugly bc she s fat and black. like the general artstyle makes every human character look weird  but no one calls them ugly
dreads aren t  boy styled  they are just dreads idky people forget any black person can get dreads
big brain
they d have to use a crane
in a darker show  they d probably just kill her if she s that insufferable.
@julian davis  dijonay jones. no sane person will want to be anywhere near that kind of personality. not even the community she is a part of.
....no  just no. plus...harder to kidnap... because she s  heavy  and insufferable  that s insulting and freaking hysterical!they could ve made her the attractive white woman who she was before  or an attractive black woman. they could ve made her look like the late aaliyah. if they wanted her to be strong  confident  and no  damsel in distress   they could ve made her like peach in the new mario movie... could ve made o  neil more muscular and or know martial arts which was revealed in a later version of tmnt...she actually knows ninjitsu .they could ve went with all of that  but no. this is the april o neil that they re giving the fans.
@gamermike  i see what you did there... mang . big brain comment  but i m not sure how many people will get it
dude is playing 4d chess over here. nice!
@amag203funny  i came to a similar conclusion yesterday that because of her weight april would be hard to kidnap. nice to know it s not just me.
i can t hear that  male gaze  bs anymore. women enjoy to look at beautiful and cute women as well. should we call that  female gaze  now
@jugglernaut  true  but that usually the  male gaze  is the first excuse in these matters  i will not dismiss your observation since there is validity.
@mike c  yes  because a lot of these people are emotionally stunted man-children and it because either they have been sheltered all their lives and or they don t how to cope in the real world to which they force the rest to look through their subjective lens.
@t-yoonit  no argument here because i m incline to agree.
@boss cuchilain  i was merely speculating on the possibility because when they look at  for example  top cow s tomb raider comics  which i bought with great regularity when i was in junior college being a comic store across the street  and how lara was depicted then look at themselves instead accepting as work of fiction because in their worldview everything has to reflect their view of real life.
it s not even about the  male gaze . humans in general are drawn to things that attract us. beautiful people attract attention. if you were to sell a product or promote something  who do you think will grab someone s attention more  a person like megan fox or mindy kaling s velma
@daunt  that is true  its human biology as we are attractive by what we see visually  and the norm is by the physically healthy due to the biological drive procreate.
come to think of it  she looks almost like bebop or rocksteady.
nah  she probably similar weight to 5 7  april .. coz she s short lol and i ve got a feeling she s not going to be insufferable either..
@amag203  what kinda... that last part is absolutley horrible.
but aren t a lot of men into big women i know i don t really mind curvy or chubby its morbid obesity that is unattractive.
@daunt megan fox is pretty but shes basically pretty wood to me she always the same looking.amanda seyfried was much prettier than her in that jennifer body movie.supermodel pretty just isn t that pretty really.
@daunt isn t velma basic design which kaling to be fair mostly still used like literally lusted over by men all the time lol.
@chandller burse  you re missing the point.
that megan fox changing scene from the movie is one of two scenes i can tell you. that and them beat boxing in the elevator. this april looks stank
@chandller burse  i m just using them as examples. be free to insert your idea of beauty standard vs. since not everyone views it the same.
@pegas105not wanting to have attractive black women on screen plays into a stigma that black isn t beautiful... which makes it a good thing they re appealing to ignorant clods who aren t aware of that stigma. because if i wasn t alone in this  this film might tank  and i m betting it won t.
@kyon  what you think i am saying it doesn t have to be anything to do with weird kinks or fetishes have you seen how asian women are viewed on the internet by men its not uncommon they are basically fetishized.also projecting is incorrect if i have a fetish for any type of woman its probably pale redheads.
@kyon  whats with the random tumblr and scat crap why you re overdramatic.
@chandller burse  exactly
@p. whitestrake  what point people here on this channel say the same crap all the time the biggest topic here is how people hate attractive women.and then we often get into the whole thing with older women being an issue like dead space because apparently older women can t be attractive.
@gabrielle tollerson  weird off tangent argument this is a kids show lol
@ann victoria  be nice
@chandller burse  i guarantee you the character designers of this movie aimed at kids werent thinking  we re making this character for all the adult chubby chasers  lmao
@chandller burse  to you . dont take subjectuivity and try to make it objective
@chandller burse  velma is mindi kaling self-insert both ideologically and physically. if you listen to what she s said in interviews and match it to velma s dialogue  it tracks. just like that one writer who did  i am not starfire  and created a daughter for starfire that looked like she had sex with danny devito s penguiin from batman returns and had a daughter  that too was a narcissistic self-insert. but that doesnt equate to profit
@budgie cat  yes as if i totally was saying that but in terms of it all you guys are also legitmately talking about kid movies characters being attractive as if that is also an important part.
hypocritical
@budgie cat  i know as much as anyone else that velma was kalings insanity.what is even the point of that comment i don t even think i said about velma here.
@budgie cat  beauty is supposedly always subjective i thought its why people here say megan fox is gorgeous when to me she s plastic barbie.
@                        who are you addressing
@pegas105  you all
@                       if i m lumped in there based on my own speculation  i will not presume to speak for the rest  may i ask how you drew your conclusion.
@budgie cat  the thing is i meant is even with kalings stupid persona her velma still resembles the original design more than the other characters.
again why do you guys care so much about her being  attractive
@jasmin tea  speaking purely for myself it s a matter of suspension of disbelief. april in every iteration wasn t exactly doing crossfit or the ironman competition but she was in decent physical shape and when you have a character basically pear-shaped who going to be in physical danger and required to do a certain amount of physical activity  it s hard to take the character seriously.
@chandller burse  i mean thats just cause velma has had a consistant unique design for over 50 years thats barely changed. april s kept changing despite her 90 s cartoon one being the most memorable
@budgie cat  and fred and velma and shaggys designs were also mostly consistent yet mindy changed them.i just mean her design is still basically the same one internet people lust over and cosplay in a sexy way all the time.
@chandller burse  its still terrble and reminds me of this new april which is also terrible.that velma show is cursed  first time i tried watching it while waiting in my car on my phone the car overheated!
@jasmin tea  because it s an entertainment product aimed at attracting men. it s not rocket science.
aw thank you
i personally like it straight  this is a little too puffy.
@melonie mac go boom  yes you really got nice hair
just wait till disney raceswaps and makes her an obese trans in their animated melonie mac show
yea her hair is pretty lit in this video.
gotta agree it s looking pretty good.
...it s because if you rearrange the letters in ginger you get a word used to describe black people.
@snowbunnie11  bruuuh....
@snowbunnie11  hey  hey  hey now. imma take a step back from that one  that s all you
april cant even run and the ninja turtles sound like tik tok brats shredder won before the show even aired its over
there s nothing wrong with attractive people but as someone wise once told me beauty isn t everything
she s literally a child in this movie and i m most of the new shows
to be fair she is probably a good representative of a modern reporter journalist.
ok i finally admit it  the whole  let s recast redheads specifically  trope is totally a thing and i m tired of pretending that it isn t.
even though they changed april s race in rise of the tmnt the reason no one got mad at it was because it was genuinely a good design for her and she looked cute and spunky in that series as opposed to what they did to her here where she looks like a balloon with eyes and legs.
i think this character stole april s jacket and pretends to be her.
that s not april  it s the whole calendar
as a fat person  who is trying to lose weight for personal and health reasons  i am so sick of this fat-phobic bs that is going around. overweight is not healthy. overweight does not look good. everyone will gain a bit here or there  but when it gets out of hand  its just bad. for years i stayed around 250-260  but i have ballooned to almost 300 before and i am down to around 212 now and i still could lose another 20-30 lbs. this crap isn t easy and i got conditions that add a little difficulty to losing weight and this omg  it is good to be fat sht has got to end. and while she doesn t look like a kid to me  if she is a kid  she is not in good shape and that will hurt her later in life. what happened to the idea the nfl had of getting kids outside and exercising  that now we are telling them to sit on the couch and do nothing  role models should present healthy attributes  and telling kids being fat is good is not the right thing. and i would bet they will show you her in action and doing stunts while overweight  which ruins the perceptions to kids and makes them think  fat   healthy and athletic.
if it wasn t april i could accept this as a character that maybe new the turtles when they were younger but this being called april aggrevates me.
for modern audiences  is another lie.  what they mean to say is   for modern audiences as we want them to be .  i don t believe most kids even in high school or younger are worried about skin color  obesity being  represented  etc.  they just want a fun game to play!
to be fair  she does at least look like the kind of journalist seth rogan would champion.
i prefer april as an adult because her and the turtles dynamic works better especially in the context of a new series in beginning with the turtles meeting april her being 20 and having a car a job so sheena pay for haver pizza and disguises for the turtles tech sometimes i guess i just prefer it
- artist  look i just finished april within the deadline  she looks great!- director  no  no  noooo. how many times do i have to repeat those things  it s the narrative that matters. she s too pretty and too slim and too white  you re going to upset the ugly girls  the fat ones as well. so make her ugly and fat ... and also black. do the exact opposite of what you did. i hope i don t need to repeat this again.- artist  ok ...
april o neil  ariel  and jessica rabbit were the triumvirate that kick-started my puberty. altering any of them would cause me to seethe.creating an outright worse version is something that genuinely pisses me off.
april went from a bombshell to the body shape of danny devito s penguin in batman returns. do not let anyone gaslight you to deny the evidence of your own eyes.
my question is why do they keep making her a teenager  she was an adult in the comics and the early shows and every other movie that s been made  but ever since like 2012 nickelodeon has been making her a teenager for some reason. i liked it when she was an adult who lived above her dad s antique shop and was like an adult older sister to the turtles. she was cool back then.
she s friends with ninjas who are mutated turtles and expect to be able to help them in any way despite her running out of breathe walking up a few stairs
i was too young to grow up with the 90s cartoon but the 2003 tmnt was badass holy hell that show was good and my little brother grew up on the 2012 one which i thought was pretty good too idk what the hell happened to tmnt since then
what did you expect  seth rogan couldn t make a decent film if spielberg was directing it.
my favorite one is tmnt 2003   april is quite beautiful in it and the turtles look amazing too.
i think you could knock april o neal out of the park as a cosplay! if you ever decide to do so  plz post it! i hope you re doing good and thank you for the great videos
this is not how i pictured the new tmnt movie in my mind.  i honestly would rather have a badass last ronin story told in live action with an idw 90 s tmnt vibe. with stunning cinematics and gorgeous visuals.
plus isn t this version of april a kid around 10-13 years old
yeah that s what i thought  like a street level vlogger or something.
she looks closer to irma than april
lmao! good one!
i didn t watch one second of rise  because of that and the turtles are drawn so poorly.
@thetmnt1fan  it s actually pretty good especially when it came to some of the fight scenes i didn t watch it at first too because the animation style but the fight scenes are really good when you get a chance  you should check it out. it s ironic cuz i m tempted to not to watch this one because of the way it s animated. honestly the only reason i probably would watch this movie is because i heard jackie chan voice master splinter in it or one of those characters.
actually plenty of people still got upset by that too..... lol. that wasn t isn t april.... she s just a black irma. but i will agree that it s a nicer design than this one for this movie. lol.
@akeem campbell  i didn t see that series  nor would i watch it  not only is the change of race in april annoying  but they made splinter look stupid  and they changed the traditional weapons of the turtles  also leonardo was always the leader  i didn t see the series either 2012 series  the fact that donatello  my favorite turtle  was in love with april was stupid.
@bluresco  it s all good my personal favorite is the 2003 version. i definitely agree with the splinter part and they made him look goofy. i kind of like the fact that rafael was leader for a change it kinda made things different. as for april  though i am not a fan of race swapping either  she was pretty cool too. to me it s how your character is developed if you just race swap and that character has no value it s a waste of time but value are not it s still lazy writing and creativity.
@bluresco  if you actually watched the show instead of complaining every single one of your  problems  are answered
hahahaha this comment wins!
nah  that s march  lol.
@thedrunkronin    she definitely doesnt do any marching
dead!!!!!
xd
all of the calendar  none of the centerfold
bruuuh!
this needs pined
gold comment
oh my god you got me rofling
with all the changes it ended up being a worse version of aprils friend irma a short lived side character
it s the whole century
ooof!
good one.
you win my good sir
clever lol
april looks like she ate all the other months
shut it down people  we re done here.
lmfao
damn i almost choke with my coffee laughing at this
lmao.... best comment ever!!!
lmaoooo
@random khajiit  b r u h
nice!
i throat laughed so hard at this it hurts... thanks.
this made me laugh so hard that i spit out my coffee.  and i wasn t even drinking any coffee!
dude  what world you in!  lololol  in high school and even back into elementary school growing up we all were into attraction and style and we pushed it harder than society or companies as mere collections of school kids! in school we all wanted the hot chicks and were genuinely disappointed or pissed of we didn t get them or if they were already taken. style and beauty and skill were always what made popularity across the board.
@umsf mercenary  that doesn t seem relevant to my point.  yes  kids always wanted characters to look certain ways.  you could call that part of what made it fun  perhaps.  but it wasn t about any particular  oppressed groups  or some such being  represented .
ded. ...now i m just thinking about how annoying seth rogan  his characters  usually are in every movie he s in
thank the lord someone else thinks rogan and his movies suck kind of.he isn t funny he relies too much on sex and violence and its not as tasteful as like simon peggs comedy can be.i cannot believe he is even hired to be donkey kong lol.
@chandller burse  he literally made his money on the type of humour he d now rant against. he was happy when it benefitted him but all other men and boys have to follow rules and have standards because he knows who keeps him in work.
seth rogen made this oh  it fits.
seth rogen laugh
@chandller burse  someone else  more like everyone else. it s a majority opinion!
i feel like all the complaints from people are self reports. i mean does it really matter what she looks like  there s still plenty of pretty women on screen. for fucks sake were getting a barbie movie this year
@rj s blanket  what s wrong with depicting normal looking people in media  i know lives are escapism but the fact of the matter is not everyone in life is built like a hollywood model
@julian davis  nothing wrong. just go and make your own original movie  with your own original all inclusive lgbttirfhjvwxyz3.1416 body positive eco friendly characters and leave already stablished fan-favorite characters alone. stop trying to make people who actually like curvy attractive girls  or muscular good looking guys  look bad.
@ray mr. e0   i myself am a muscular guy
@big tech is big brother  i d say i m about a solid 7 or 7.5. people say i look like cuba gooding jr. but he s not attractive to everyone
@julian davis  and how do you feel about being attractive to more women  or men  than a regular-looking or a chubby dude  would you say it s bad  do you feel like a piece of meat  get my point  there s nothing wrong with depicting normal people on media  but there s also nothing wrong with preserving the original design of the character  or at least its original  soul  . and no  april wasn t originally black. if they want to adress new generations  why don t they just create all-new stuff for people to feel represented to  why to change already established characters already beloved by an entire generation to a point where there not recognizable at all
@ray mr. e0   definitely feel like a peice of meat sometimes . but i get what you re saying and getting at though. new characters would definitely be welcome
oh my god can you just imagine a modern jessica rabbit  there s absolutely no way she s made by modern hollywood  it s absolutely hilarious how delusional hollywood has become  making things for a non existing audience  and we just have flop after flop after flop and they just can t get the message. but they ll eventually run out of money  they cannot continue to haemorrhage money forever.
just gonna go out on a limb here and guess  you like redheads
just don t be surprised by it. expect it in fact. they want to use the nostalgia to push their message. it s a win win no matter what. here s the message and if it fails  the franchise was destroyed. i already don t even react to this shit. anything i loved that comes back today is 100  going to be crap. there s nothing to be excited about. their job is to demoralize you and it s working.
i don t know if i liked those characters because i m into blondes redheads  or if i m into blondes redheads because of the female characters of the shows i watched growing up. i would regularly see teela from he-man  scarlett from gi joe  april from tmnt  sheila from dungeons   dragons. and of course there were reruns of old cartoons featuring daphne on scooby doo  josie from josie and the pusycats  and mary jane on spider-man. hell  even the two  family  cartoons  the jetsons and the flintstones  featured mothers who were redheads.so when you get a kid like me who rots his brain on tv while growing up  it s almost like the tv is trying to teach him what sort of girls to look for when he gets older.
jessica rabbit was always too cartoony to be sexy to me.
@ insert clever name here  yes i do.i know you didn t ask me but i do not care.
funny  all of them were redheads and 2 out 3 have been black faced...let s hope hollywood never remakes rodger rabbit - they ll probably redraw jessica looking like lizzo.
and let s not forget baroness from g.i.joe  d
dude  i m a black guy who was brought into puberty the exact same way. hot cartoon redheads. so what the actual eff is this garbage
i hear ya.
@ac  and here you are pushing your right wing message
she s whoopi goldberg
does it really matter though  shes received multiple changes the past few years. she s gotten both younger  and has had her race changed before. why is it an issue now
@julian davis  we re not talking about her getting younger or her race change. that s not the issue being made.
@julian davis  people didn t like those previous changes either. this was just the overweight straw that broke the camel s back.
@julian davis  it s been an issue before too.... you re clearly new to this lol. yes it does matter because it s happening way too often to not only continue gingercide but also change history culture....
thats just devitos regular shape.
real
just like ya mama
stoopppp!!
@amazin lynn  it s true! that s what i don t get about fat representation in superhero s because would you want someone to save you who has to take insulin   flies down to you hanging from a building  sorry citizen it took me a bit to get here  wheezes sorry hold on  dayum woo! i m a sit for a second if that s okay. fat as fuck
@the snitch nine dog   guess we ll have to see the next trailers to see how fast she run! or not!
@amazin lynn   it s going to be an hour long
@trickshot_katebishop
@lois griffin  but u both have same mama
@boss ross  i feel like it s as big of a deal as you make it. for every movie or show that has someone ugly we still have our netflix dating shows and other stuff. so i feel like it s not as bad personally
@robert toews  what is it then
@the lostone  if she s a good character who cares if she s overweight
@julian davis  melonie mac explained it very clearly. may i suggest rewatching the video. if you still don t get it  then there s not much any of us can do to help. we ll simply part agreeing to disagree.
@robert toews  was at work so didn t really see much of what she said. let s see if i feel any different
@julian davis  for one  because of the reasons they made her black and fat  you know as well as i do that she s likely not going to be a good character in the first place. for another point. even if she s to be a good character  that s still not april.  this design is so different you may as well have called her by a different name  and if you wanted to write april in later  do so with a more respectful design. at this point  it makes as much sense as taking four human teens  and when they pick up these magical weapons and say  cowabunga   they transform into super powered turtles that look like ninjas.
stereotype black american woman.
@julian davis  it always matters  especially when it s come to main characters. it s been an issue for years. you just didn t know it. how hard it is to stay faithful as much as possible to the original  especially when it comes to physical appearance  all of this race-bending   body-bending are all bullshit. it doesn t add anything but disappointment for the loyal fans.
@the lostone  i think it s best to not pass judgment until the movies out. because if it ends up good what ll happen is that people are gonna work themselves up for nothing and i personally think it s unnecessary
@robert toews  so from my understanding it s just that she s not conventionally attractive
@julian davis  i have serious doubts that it even can be a good movie. when they make changes like this  11 times out of 10 it s because they hate their original audience.nothing good ever seems to come from that.
so u aren t gonna have that same energy for the turtles  splinter or the other mutants  u just reaching
@julian davis  exactly it is just ppl reaching just like the sjws does do too
@the lostone  yet ppl are more upset at the race swap than the fact she was younger in the last few versions
@kuggacourage gx  people have already shared their disapproval of the past changes to april. you re only noticing now because the more drastic the change is  the stronger resentment people feel about it. especially given the current agenda driven trend of changes.
@the lostone  don t judge it before it s even out. if im wrong im wrong but look at what everyone said about spiderverse or puss in boots. and if it is good try to not let the  woke  stuff mess up your perception
@julian davis  because we live in modern day and there s a certain intention behind the swap. are you new to this world
@haterator  which comment are you replying to
@julian davis  remember  the reason they make deliberately woke content  is because they have a seething hatred for fans of the original work. the stuff they do  like turning characters into a woke caricatures  is a sign that they don t have good intentions in the making of the movie  and will reflect in the quality. take note  that neither puss n  boots nor the spiderverse movie lead or followed with that same negative energy. instead of bastardizing characters to virtue signal  they focused on making decent films  and it showed.besides  why bother giving money directly to people that hate you  when you don t need their product   that s ultimately what leads to these films flopping before people even know if they re remotely enjoyable or not.
@julian davis  it s not it s her attractiveness that s the problem!
@julian davis  because it s not april
@julian davis  it s going to be an issue even more so if the movie is good
@kuggacourage gx  wrong
@amador cortinas  it isnt
@kuggacourage gx  exactly my point in denial!
@the lostone  no there isn t. u still got ppl being dead silent about the last changes. the only complain was when she became black. the internet broke cause of that. not when she became a teenager nor not looking like her original version. so move on. and agenda  stop reaching
@amador cortinas  how does that make it worse
@the lostone  see the thing is people are judging and calling it a woke caricature before the movie is even out! we don t know what this april is like or how the movie will be. they re basing it on her appearance alone. what if the movie ends up being spiderverse or puss in boots level good
yeah what is up with the fupa
@julian davis  the appearance is the woke caricature...nothing more than a replacement for  diversity  sake.april o neil was made a popular character known for being a redhead bombshell and for reporting the news.   that character started going downhill when they decided to start de-aging her and making her more of a fighter  because it felt forced. why would you take a character that looks nothing like who they re supposed to be  when you can literally introduce them as a new character  retcons are lazy enough as it is. why insult fans by telling them this blob is supposed to be one of their staple favorites from the franchise s prime
@the lostone  i can see what you re saying and i m not saying i don t agree to some extent. but my issue comes with the uproar. people will literally send death threats to the writers and actors just because they changed a character. so when i hear these complaints that s what my mind automatically goes to and it makes me not feel as sympathetic. because at the end of the day everything that character was still has all their past source material that you can enjoy. but like i said i get what you re saying
@julian davis  yeah  death threats  or harassing individuals period  is uncalled for.
@julian davis  because it s going to forever change april and it s going to green light every character to be changed in everything and that s bullshit why can t they come with new stories for the already existing good characters!
@julian davis  on top of that her character in this movie will never be good because to put it simply it s not april it doesn t even matter how good the movie is!
@julian davis   l
@jason87077  tell me you don t get any without saying you don t get any lol.
bro we talking about a cartoon here
@dejuan hickman  and
@the lostone yall dtm
@the lostone  i thought people do criticize spiderverse for wokeness eh maybe thats just leftovers of people who always resented miles morales existing.he still isn t as good as peter lets be fair he essentially exists to just be able to attract younger fans to the character still and have diversity added to it.not like he s a bad character though.
@the lostone  eh to be fair as far i see april was originally black at first in the comics but she didn t look like this
goddamn! that s the best one yet!
dude i m skinny as hell and i still lose my breath while running up the stairs
@sailor star  same  which proves my point imagine an actual overweight person
@chandller burse  april wasn t black in the original comics either. she was white with a perm  which was relatively common in the 80 s for women.
@chandller burse  yeah  spiderverse wasn t critized for wokeness so much as it was for cheapening the spider-man character as a whole. it basically said that any and everyone can be spider-man if they get bit by the right spider... even if they re literally a pig.miles  character wasn t bad  he just didn t really add anything different from peter parker. just different looking with a slightly different life circumstance. basically  a  palette swap .   even his  spider venom was a knockoff of another character s  spider-woman.
@the lostone  actually thats always been the point of spider-man.stan lee said this himself the reason he even has a full covered suit is because it would allow almost any kid  i guess mostly just boys of course   to see themselves as him.
@the lostone  and miguel o hara was a irish mexican mixed man who was spider-man 2099 in the 80s before miles anyways.
@the lostone  people say she was based on the creators mixed girl friend.
@the lostone  also spider-ham has been a character for awhile now anyways.
@julian davis    looks at live action ariel  live action snow white  live action tinkerbell  live action blue fairy
@chandller burse  her name was. and even then  mixed isn t black. it s mixed.
@chandller burse  there s a reason most knockoffs  like all these tokenized spider-man  don t have the same longevity as the real deal. but nowadays  woke marvel will try to keep the woke tokenized characters around by replacing  the originals  despite it having lead to their dwindling audience  film  comic  or otherwise.
@chandller burse  you re missing the point. regular people can relate to him. that isn t the same as having his powers. there s no real point in putting out color swapped copies of him  with virtually nothing unique about the copies and creating a whole series about them.a miniseries  sure. but an entire spin-off of telling the same story with a different color  not so much.it d be different if they made mm actually feel like a different character from pp.
@the lostone  i mean people do like mm and feel related to him.and he has been written differently from peter at times.
@the lostone  miles isn t a spin off he s actually a successor to ultimate peter who died.although now he is in the main world of the comics and works with the mainstream peter parker.
@the lostone  miles and 2099 miguel have actually had very longevity dude so i don t know what you mean.most alternate spider-men are usually just a version of peter anyways its rare for it to be a different person altogether.even the once hated ben riley i believe is still active and more liked than usual these days could be wrong.
@chandller burse  i ve often found that most who say they love mm are only casual fans. that can be said about characters in general  but i m referring to the staunch defenders of the character.
@the lostone  i am sure plenty of casual fans also only like peter too.hell a portion of the spider-man fanbase which has sometimes branded itself as the majority it feels like are the raimi fans.
@chandller burse  i think you missed the part where i said most knockoffs lack longevity. mm  in particular  is more of an example of modern marvel trying to tell fans he s amazing  rather than vice-versa. similar to the current iterations of characters like c. marvel and m. marvel. he s really just not that different from pp. same personality as well. same energy. black latin mix doesn t mean different character  just different looking.
@the lostone  eh i mean the comics have always said that peter is basically average besides certain feats.his identity is even revealed once on a security cam and the dude who sees it even admits he would never figure out who it is since he looks like 50  of nyc.
@chandller burse  her name was based on one of the creator s mixed ex girlfriend. but april  the character  was never black or mixed.
absolutely the best tmnt animated series!
the movie is gonna be good april was never a factor on what makes or breaks a tmnt movie she s just there
@m  she s the lead protagonist. involved intimately in nearly every story plot.she was literally the first character introduced in the original show and film. and she has as much screen time as any turtle. the new films  not canon  even had them as her pets.
@noneya bidness   but who s watching any ninja turtles movie or cartoon for april   that s my point the protagonist are the turtles and   non canon   regarding ninja turtles is a stupid thing to say cause every version is canon to itself and they all have nothing to do with eachother
@m  no  every version isn t canon. and everyone who watches  that s who. you sound like a very one-dimensional personality.
i suppose it takes all types. if everyone had a thought out position  it d be no different than talking to myself.
that s the version i grew up with
me too!
i grew up with the 80s tmnt  but the 2003 series is far and away the best iteration.
in the context of this video  you may want to clarify you mean og april o neal.
i m a guy. i was always kind of fat growing up and i m still kind of fat. conventionally beautiful people encouraged me to get fit and workout. there are moments of insecurity  but i worked through it. especially seeing characters on screen work to improve their weight and be healthier. it made me want to be healthier. if they want to make a character fat  that s fine. but they should also show that character improving themselves. maybe with a workout montage
there is a tmnt pinball game in a restaurant down the road from me. on the console the game says april is like 5 foot 7 8 and about 113lb i remember thinking  wow! she is tall to be that thin!  the new april appears to be neither tall  nor thin. go figure
once the media sees april with the turtles they are going to confuse her as the 5th member
when i was little and played ninja turtles with my friends  if a girl wanted to play  we d go  cool! you can be april! and she d love to do it because april was smart  pretty  and capable  a wonderful role model for girls.but now that would be mean to say that to a little girl.  you wanna play  too  okay  you can be frumpy  eggplant-shaped one.
it is 2023 and a character we loved from the past is..made ugly again. yeah 2023. i wonder how this series will do!
its a continuation of her look from the rise of the tmnt cartoon  but she was too young and cute in those cartoons apparently.so they had to modify the character further.possibly to remove the love interest angle that s been a running thing since the first live action movies. but its perfectly normal for teens to get crushes and fantasize about attractive adults. as long as its not taken seriously and acted upon.but they made april a teen in a nickelodeon tmnt run  and so she stays younger after that for no good reason except i guess kids can fall for fictional kids now.
they will try to crucify for this but everything you said is true. when i saw the trailer i blew a gasket! i had enough of this trend of destroying popular franchise that most of loved when we were young
man all those twitter users forgot to even do a april fools joke
we went from mega foxx to velma
maybe people will appreciate micheal bay s depiction of april o neil more now she s played by megan fox for those that don t know.
never thought that i m gonna miss the michael bay tmnt..
oh my gosh april o neil is very cute.especially for a animation character.just hoping this is better than the other remake of the ninja turtles movie
i d be lucky to have someone like miss mac here in my life
she built like hbo velma  they so did it on purpose because they saw the attention velma got. so they thought  let s make april ugle af and nothing like any of her previous looks  to get people to hate watch. just why..... why.....
dammit  how did mindy kalings velma end up in tmnt !
people still to this day talk about 80s animated april. they gush over memories of her  they draw art of her. they cosplay as her  because she has a simple yet appealing design that withstood the test of time as a snapshot of the 80s.nobody is going to cosplay this april. she will never be  the  april  she ll only ever be  that  april.
if you asked me who this character is supposed to be without telling me anything first  april o neil is not a name i would ever guess in a million years...
she was the only human shown in the trailer if i recall so maybe all the humans in the movie will look like turtles lolmy story idea would have been for them to make a new character altogether and have her be baxter s daughter  who is april s boss  and was originally black in the comics and a villain in the comics   and have her look up tp april and want to follow her in her footsteps so she investigates the turtles and meets and befriends them and since  i heard baxter is a villain in this movie  similar to how miles finds out his uncle is the prowler as a plot twist  she too would find out her father is the villain and be torn between her friendship of the turtles and april and her love of her father. but nope...lazy raceswap
even the 2012 series that aged her down made her cute. they didn t get creepy or weird with it  or oversexualize her  but she was still pretty. donnie fell head over heels in love with her at first sight  and it was adorable . i grew up with the old 87 series  but 2012 is my favorite version. i was hoping this would be in that same vein. or like the criminally underrated 2007 film. the  turtles looked great in that one. chris evans-- fucking cap himself-- played casey jones. oh  and april was cute. story wasn t the best  but the look  the setpieces  and the action were great and the characters were all likable.
i grew up on the 80s-90s cartoon. i collected the toys. there is only one april o neil to me. the first movie is the only exception to that. and she s only april for the movie.
yes
or just make the character the way it was suppose to be  people don t always have to care about everyone s personal struggles.
same! heroes should have qualities that people strive for but cannot achieve. perfect body  selflessness  morals  incorruptibility  etc. that s what makes them heroes.
good take. i mean  if they really wanted to make her not so perfect  they could have made her more  normal average . they didn t have to go this far with her body type
what if the girl wanted to be a turtle
@chandller burse  it never came up  so you ll just have to improvise.
@chandller burse   venus wouldn t come into existence until 1997 as the fifth ninja turtle in ninja turtles next mutation. venus de milo was the first and so far only female ninja turtle.
@demonicremption  that didn t answer chandler s question
@demonicremption  they are four turtles named after historic artists and the newest female turtle is named after a planet slash goddess of love and sex in roman myth could they not have picked a female artist name to keep with the style
that is a cheap trick repeated many times to enrage anyone that could have liked the turtles and draw attention  even if is the bad kind  because that is all that they can do now!
bad
@booming bob  disagree it would do good
@animezilla 44  it would be good
bro idc if she s ugly or yall be racist of april being in black. but ik that the past wasn t like this so it still can be april by doing things she do so it will be good
@justnico  it be one think if she was black and cute but they made her the opposite
it s gonna be fine  its only the adults that thinks that way . kids wont care about this shit.
@tempest  sone kids do those that want an accurate portrayal but yeah most kids arent aware of this stuff but doesn t mean it ll be good it all depends if they can make a good movie even tho
@tempest  yeah
@booming bob  i mean yeah but i dont think a design judges if a movie is or bad   you know
@tempest  it s just if s small change is so willing it tells there willing to change bug chunks if the story
disagree with you nothing has been destroyed especially not this movie considering it got mostly positive comments i think the franchise is in good hands cuz you keep forgetting this is paramount they know how to handle their franchise unlike marvel
@animezilla 44  if i ever heard so much sarcasm
3 damn decades of the same shit... and the thing is they re not marketing to your asses anymore  should all be adults with responsibilities more important than how a animated movie is executed unless you re the damn animator.
and velma went from linda cardellini to mindy kaling.
@surly unicorn   yes  with kate micucci in-between there.
megan fox was horrible as april. she s no judith hoag.
@jtc  at least she wasn t too far off physically as april. this new april looks like someone else stole her identity  killed her secretly  then buried her body in the back garden.
@adu1991  kate miccuini isn t that bad.
@p. whitestrake  i disagree megan fox was the wrong choice i really didn t like that interpretation of the character
@p. whitestrake  or just... ate the body.
mega fox  u mean giant fox
she was the only good thing in those crappy movies.
why should we appreciate anything bay does anymore
funnily enough  no. hate megan fox as april... lol
fox wasn t the best for the role  but man...
@vespene gas  the only reason she was cast for the role was because of the sex appeal but obviously it didn t go well for some people because she was heavily criticized as well
@animezilla 44  yep  pretty much it.
michael bay must be laughing his ass off when we ranted about his films only to get this
@jared walker  he s in no position to laugh because we don t know how the box-office outcome for this
lmao
hahaha so funny
it s the same with the swapped velma and little mermaid characters.the most popular cosplay is still the classic design no matter how many revisions the characters go through.
they talk about 80s april as if she wasn t an extremely progressive character for her time . career driven  confident  attractive but not flaunting it like a diva  hard working  under appreciated and facing constant sexual discrimination  but she was loyal and had the turtles backs ... yet they treat her with disrespect ... because even though she is fictional . the are jealous of her. facts
well said.
they aren t selling to you anymore... grow tf up  take your nostalgia and make room for actual kids to make their own damn memories
@cy spiegel  if they want kids to make their own damn memories  they can create their own damn characters
no. stephen amell played casey jones. not chris evans.
@kevvo lightswift  that s the 2014 film.
april o neill is a mutant now too  . right
april is just as identifiable as the turtles with their headband colors. that s like saying donatello is wearing red now.just like the age of 3d  customers are going to speak with their wallets. it just may take another 10 years.
the potato april had me rolling!
yep  you have a hard point. april is supposedly like a damsel in distress  but it seems like society wants to  get away from women being feminine or feminine looking.... and want women to be masculine like....  that s what i see how april is designed in this tmnt  it s not so much about color that s the issue. it s about her character that makes her a time honored trademark to he tmnt franchise  a beautiful girl who s a reporter  that needs to be protected. everyone knows the turtles has a crush on april because she s attractive  an eye candy.here s the big problem  if this version of april is portrayed as what i see  masculine looking etc.  possibly an alternative life style  how are we gonna get casey jones   hollywood let alone america is gone completely woke  defeminizing women in every shape and form  and emasculating them. the sad part is that they re using color to push this angeda which is exploiting people of color.color has nothing to do with an alternative appearance lifestyle  it s a choice.
i mainly wonder about the apparently disproportionate legs  but oh well. i liked the eastman   laird original tmnt comics but not much after.  i don t particularly care about this  but the change seems to be more of a writing room self-insert rather than anything else.  this is probably just seth rogen s self insert of himself as april o neil.  and shush  you re a beautiful woman all the way through.
i love that melonie has ascended to the level of passively triggering angry joe.
just as bruce wayne s alias is batman  velma s alias is april o neil! who knew
i don t even have the patience or energy to ask why  and i already know the answer  woke writers are poisonous to this industry.also  april looks like a claymation velma  which is just pure nightmare fuel
create a new character if it s going to be soo unrecognizable from og april.
they got april out here lookin like a single mother
wow  they really changed her look. i grew up with the 1980s and 1990s cartoon and well  they certainly went a different direction.
they made april here look like the cleaning lady asking the turtles for more lemon pledge.
10 59  look how they massacred my boy.
april s looks in the og comics was based on kevin eastman s wife  the late april fisher....who was a long dark wavy haired white woman.
i m pass the whole race thing cus the last variant of her was black and apparently if we go way back in the comics she was mixed too. so ya i was confused by it and i did rolled my eyes on that  but i got over it soon after. of course we re use to seeing her as a white hot woman so that s what we go by. the issue we have here is how this april is overweight if we re being honest.look i know some people want to be  real  when it comes to fiction stuff so we can  relate  but most of the time we look for over the top stuff and exaggerated content. or we can look at it another way and say we want to look at things that have that healthy appearance to them too especially when it comes to things related to super heroes and powers cus those people would be more in shape when fighting and doing all the action stuff.i m glad u brought up nico as an example cus yeah for me personally she s not my type  but at the same time she does fit certain beauty standards and i wouldn t call her ugly either.
honestly i didnt really like a lot of the older versions of april. from the super old ones and the nickelodeon 2012 version. but then there was the bayverse live action one that i liked a little bit. then the rottmnt where they made her black. i actually fully loved the rottmnt version since she was actually fun and not a little shit   looks at 2012 version . i even liked the style and everything and how they made the turtles entirely diffrent species   took time to like all the changes but honestly i liked it so much more than any other version !but then this came out. mutant mayhem. i liked how they tried to combine all the versions but the style looks off to me and april- shes ok  i like they tried to keep the rottmnt part of her in since she was actually fun. but they messed her up so badly...btw  i grew up off of the 2003 version up to 2012 version   mostly 2012 one. i loved the turtles more on that one but they made that april such a bitch and angered me .
the 3d rendered april is down right grotesque but i d totally watch a show with the cute april with the plushies.
velma failed in her show so she decided to audition for tmnt s april
because that s the current trend  like velma.
i feel like there a miss opportunity to add more characters in cartoons with there own backstory. bring in old characters and if you want to add a new one you can write an old character off the show and bring a new one. or they could have had the old character working with a new character for. time which got people establish to the new character and old character working side-by-side four a period of time before transitioning over.
april  of the african o neal family
teenage mutant ninja april
the 2012 april is a mutant
this ain t got enough to do no self insert
but seth rogen is saving black lives  huh hun huh  puff puff puff
you don t even know if they have any woke writers
@adam  what
@tamayesha blate  with his powerful representation  he s such a hero.
that doesn t make any sense as i recalled there are many different versions of april o neil. does she has to look like the one from the 80s cartoon the answer is no
@animezilla 44  actually it does make sense. theres no point in keep reinventing the wheel. whats wrong with creating a new character  she coulda been baxter s daughter  new character0 as baxter is april s boss and was a villain in the comics and i heard the villain in this movie. so have him have a daughter that loos up to april  wanting to follow in her footsteps to make her dad proud  she investigates the turtles and meets and befriends them but then later is torn when she finds out her father is the villain  similar to miles morales finding out his uncle is the prowler  and has to choose between her idol april and the turtles and her devotion to her dad.
wild  this movie gonna negative . just wait for the release
@02 alpha zero  i still plan on seeing it  but it was definitely a needless change
no i think that is too harsh against all the single mothers out there... this april they made looks like see is a mutant and an ugly one at that. i never thought i d see the day they made april worse looking then the turtles... i dont know what master splinter looks like yet... but i m sure its closer... were they trying to confuse the audience on the two characters
yeah. things change over time. it s pretty normal
i don t even think she looks bad. what s so bad about her design  as long as she acts like april  why does it matter what she looks like
iirc  she was biracial too.
don t worry . april was only black since rise.. the rest is a myth
no ur wrong she s was completely white
what s so bad about her
or bring in the turtles other human friend angel
i remember april o neil being a 28-year old  stunning news reporter
interesting  when melonie said she don t want to be represented reminded me why myths are universally acclaimed  it is the fact that we as human beings at subconscious level understand our own imperfection and for this reason we aspire for archetypes or guides of something higher  it is imprinted in our species  i wonder who will win  nature vs the financial power... seems very clear to me
back when i was in high school when it comes to the tmnt 2012 series where they are supposed to be teenagers so april o neil is a teen in that iteration and i thought my teenage self thought she looked cute. apparently some or most individuals will pull the  she is a minor  why do you care!   card or the  body-shaming  card when it comes to simply disliking a fictional character design  it s not a real life person  if it was a real life person that is a completely different discussion. the  rise tmnt  has a way better black april design despite not resembling too much previous iterations but at least cute   appealing. i was on your thread   some people are associating  cuteness  to  sex appeal  which is off rails  sex appeal is big boobs  big butts  curves  or a hot masculine body .
i think your right most people will just be disappointed because it ruins the nostalgia  but for the most part they look like they nailed it  an rocksteady an bebop looking good looking forward to seeing them
i have and it s terrible. hey melonie. hope you re doing well.  biggitarmy here.
from april o neal to arpil o nough. the surname o neill is an anglicization of the original irish ua n ill  composed of the elements ua  meaning  grandson  or  descendant   and of the irish name niall. never met anyone who s black and irish  this coming from someone who s part irish.
i thought april o neil was supposed to be a tv news reporter. so she is supposed to  look good  on camera.       and melonie keep using the term  modern audience  and it always reminds me of the critical drinker s video  the myth of the modern audience .
it looks like they tried to combine april o neil and splinter into one character.
couldn t agree more! i grew up with april o neill and i ve had a crush on her as a cartoon character my whole teenage life and this reimagining of that character makes me shake my head in disappointment. we are heading in such a weird direction when we are designing and creating and i m seeing it over and over again. all this political messaging has ruined what we grew up so much to love in all these movies  tv shows  etc that it s gone insane and out of hand just to please whom exactly  your not out to please the fans that are your mass audience i ll tell you that much.
the new april reminds me of another beloved i.p. that took a massive blow. a certain self insert that they say we gave them a second season due to hate watching.
this april looks frumpy at best. people really need to learn to live with their insecurities because otherwise this constant back and forth is just never gonna stop.
honestly for me when it comes to the live action movies i prefer the actress they got for the 2 3 movies because i found her to be more attractive than the actress in the original.
this is so true. i hate what they did to april. i mean what s wrong with a beautiful april. this is terrible. and what the heck is up with don. the rest have normal male voices  but don sounds like a girl or like he s five. plus giving him glasses  to say  hey this is the nerdy one. we never needed him to have glasses to know that he s the nerdy one. it s an old trope. take care melonie. you re the best
i m not sure i 100  agree that april always has to be beautiful - she s been a young teenager in enough versions by now that it s an acceptable interpretation of her  she doesn t always have to be a full-on babe - but i do agree that she should at very least be cute. she s either a looker  or will be one  that s part of her character  it s in contrast to her co-stars. i mean  the turtles have that ugly-cute thing goin  on  splinter is a rat  casey jones is occasionally a bit of a himbo  but his looks don t really inform his character  and anyway  he wears a mask - they re all kind of grotesques in their own ways. on those occasions where she s a reporter  even her coworkers tend to be kind of gawkish at the very least. she s typically the only genuinely attractive person in the entire cast  and now she s being uglified  too   no  not  uplifted   good grief  spellchecker.  i get the argument that everyone being super-hot is unrealistic  but surely it s also unrealistic the other way round  it s very rare  in my experience  for a moderate-sized group of youngish people not to include at least one attractive person.
this is more based on nickelodeons rise of tmnt. so this is more of prequel alternative universe for that series then anything. the characters seem to be much younger in this movie. which rise isn t too bad nor the worst tmnt we have gotten in animated media wise. however it doesn t translate well to more cgi animation style.
i still remember what she looked like in the original comics. long before the 1990 film. long before the yellow jumpsuit and long before they colour coded the bandanas.
i hate to find out what they would do to casey jones.
mel would make a great april!
race actually didn t come to mind at all. i took it as big girls need love too
liked shared and very appreciative to hear the female nerd perspective.
well my surname is baxter and i m as dark as the new april .. as much as i wish we had 80s april in this film  that isn t a good argument ... and boy are there a lot of black people with the surname baxter ...
@mister generation  baxter at least is considered anglo-saxon along with scottish  so it s conceivable that there were anglo-american slave owners with the surname baxter and former slaves kept the last name  i sure as heck know my last name didn t come from west africa . but o neil  what irish slave owners were there in the southern usa
what about shaquille o neal from the nba
morgan freemans character in shawshank was irish.
also black and irish mixed is not like impossible to be fair
@sabishiihito    funny  the name baxter is actually used in the tmnt franchise with the character of baxter stockman  who has been most often depicted in the series  history  excluding maybe the og 80s cartoon  as a black mad scientist
@green sakana  your grandfather s surname makes him sound like a irish mobster.who got a documentary with him being played by morgan freeman or denzel washington.
@chandller burse  i would be all about that documentary  tbh.  that sounds like it rules.
she doesn t understand what modern audience are
no they re not i think they doing this for attention and trolling and plus they run out of ideas. they can t even make update own s    they got to go back in the day the independence business is looking very good with their movie s
@christopher loyd  good point  so when it bombs and they wonder why  i know i won t watch it when it arrives in the theatres.
@steve  i don t think this movie s going to bomb at all considering how many talented people are involved with this project let s not forget that this is paramount not disney they know how to handle their franchise and ip
@christopher loyd  i don t think that s the case at all
it s especially stupid because how can he be so physical and fight if he has to wear glasses
i have a bad feeling they done something to don for him to sound that way.
@father pucci  i feel the same way. i don t really want to think about it
@the real stephentv  my imagination is going crazy right now
@father pucci  perhaps they removed the tello leaving only dona.
i do hate the way they ve made don the  nerdy one  in the last few films. they never did that in the original cartoons
@liam warner  that is what i think they did
@snes head  yes that is true. and not all nerds wear glasses or sound like a little girl when the rest sound more mature.
@snes head isn t mikey more of a nerd type anyways
i m glad that i m not the only one that s mad that they gave donatello glasses  like not all geniuses wear glasses you know just look at jimmy neutron or reed richards for example
i wear glasses because my eyes are bad  not because i m a nerd.
@terrance bagley  but most nerds probably got glasses because they stared at screens too much.i am almost certain playing mario 64 and sly cooper up close to the tv was why i have glasses now.
@father pucci  that s because of the voice actor
@chandller burse  i have glasses
@chandller burse  mikey has never been anywhere close to being a nerd in any version.
@scott tenorman s pubes  so he s not into comic books superheroes and sci fi and action flicks nerd doesn t mean smart always
@chandller burse  donny would fall into  the category of nerd and mikey would be more of a geek.
@father pucci   i don t like don s voice but it s not that deep his voice actor is a kid that s it
so someone having a bigger body type isn t beautiful
@sailor star   fat is ugly it is what it is
honestly i think the glasses fit  he s a nerd so it makes sense  but i see what you mean  the voice is odd too  kinda weird how everyone sounds older except him  they really should of swapped that voice with mikey
he s danny devito...probably.
not a redhead
@bruce leeds  and the black girl is
@bruce leeds  wigs are available!
yeah  i m upset at the fact that they were calling her ugly because she s plus size
the reason why they are doing this is to change the beauty standard. they want to push the mentality of  you are beautiful the way you are . its really sad that companies promotes this kind of behavior of just being lazy and everyone needs to accept you the way you are without putting any effort.
i don t like aprils new design even though it s the same design from rise of the tmnt  i wish they d bring back the old design with some new into it. but i m really glad they brought bebop   rock steady. i m very curious how rose byrne will play as leatherhead
it s velma 2.0 not april and i m laughing so hard at the breakdowns on this
easy to explain in 2 words  seth...rogan. enough said!
velma is in everything these days.
thank you so much for speaking up about this  they always want to be woke and inclusive with the black characters. oh and the original april from the comics was black!
april went from befriending turtles to eating turtles!
i didn t even realize that was supposed to be her until reading the comments  can t we just have original 80 s april back again
well... it s from seth rogen  so this explains sooo much
this april version looks more like a turtle than the mutant turtles themselves.
they needed to do this because their small imaginations won t let them put themselves into the game unless they re represented.
that original tmnt cover with april o neil was based on kelly lebrock from weird science and the woman in red.
velma has now made her way into tmnt i see.
finally someone shows her classic design- i mean i m sorry i grew up with the black pants  red hair in a pony tail  yellow shirt  and that whole area. no bossy bad bitch  or whatever the heck they got now and with the trailer  just the basic april o neil
your hair looks good today
holy crap! april has been turned into squirrel girl!
as soon as i saw seth rogan was involved in the project i knew it would be a bust. still thinking of how bad santa inc. was and now anytime i see seth rogan s involvement i see that same infection.
instead of being able to appreciate beauty  we see something and say   i can t attain that figure! we need to shame them and get rid of it! and we need to change it to look just like me!  yet they ll also have no problem oogling chris hemsworth s abs and biceps in the latest avengers film. our society is so bipolar and inconsistent.
i am not tmnt fan  but this push away from conventional beauty standards  as an artist i understand that symmetry is pleasing to the eye and pushing away from aggravates me so.
melanie  you just gain a new subscriber   thank you for making this point of view. why not make her a different  character  and not april  and  you right o neil irish decent. thank you for your honest opinion
oh jeezsus christ!
i get it. he s talented and wealthy. an you aren t. that s a shame.
thank you so much  d
add preacher to that list.
what beauty standards does people even know the meaning of the word
at least the rise version was a cute girl. they didn t even have the decency to do that this time
this is the problem with making nostalgia bait that offends the audience s memories of the original. people don t have nostalgia for the names  they have it for the entire package and visuals are a large part of that. i won t watch shows movies or play nostalgia bait games where the characters i love have been reimagined as ugly and i m not alone.
i was super excited when i seen this announced especially some of the characters that they re adding that haven t really been featured in a while. like mondo gecko and some of the other random mutants. however after we watching the trailer i must say i m actually not as hyped anymore not for a reason such as this april o neil flop... but more the fact although yes i get it s nickelodeon but i m tired of seeing tmnt done where it s very zany and cartoony i want something to revert back to the original comics which was actually for their time pretty freaking dark... also i m just going to say it because i m going to have to why the crap does splinter have an afro
new april looks like she never took bath after covid lockdowns.
typical generic excuses for changing things for the worse. great video as usual  i hope you enjoyed your weekend  have an awesome day!
we asked for april o neil and got patrice o neal.
what s the new velma doing in ninja turtles
i think you achieved that goal of looking as good as her in the  early years. when you showed picture first thought was one of the turtles in disguise. lol.  clearly they hate the character. halle berry   gorgeous  56 years . lesley-ann brandt  gorgeous 41 years. eartha kitt when she was in batman  40 years    just off top of my hed. etc. may god continue to bless you and keep you safe and well.
2 20 put glasses on that april and bam! i would be happy to see that version of her in mutant mayhem. she can have the glasses as an accessory or something but yes i approve of this fan drawn april more then the official version
to be fair... shaquille o neil isn t scottish or irish.
i think historically people like seeing attractive  successful people in entertainment because it motivates everyone to do their best.  i want to admire people who i perceive to be doing even better than i am at the game of life!
i ve just come to the conclusion that when it comes to the tmnt in movies or tv shows  nothing will ever top the 2003 series. a show that was true to the source material while borrowing elements from the original cartoon that made the series popular. outside of the 1990 movie  this show is probably the closest we will ever get to the mirage tmnt being depicted on screen. and as great and classic as the original 87 show is  i m tired of it being looked at as the standard or that every media has to include bebop  rocksteady  or kraang. the mirage comics are vast and include so much untapped potential  yet they keep focusing on a cartoon that s 35 years old. i say let s get back to the real source material and make something that can be appreciated by both kids and adults. the 2003 show showed that it s possible.
nooooooo!!!not my april!!!my first ever cartoon crush sigh i had my suspicions that something like this may happen  i didn t want to believe my suspicions but alas  we now have the worst looking april design sigh thanks for fighting the good fight melonie
i agree. i don t care that she is black so long as her core character is in tacked. which as much as i love the 2012 series she is not the same april. she is a different character with thr same name. and she was one of my least favorite parts of that show. luckily the turtles and splinter more then made up for her. but april. should be that big sister almost mother at times character for the turtles. and when she is the same age as them  it makes that dynamic difficult  if not impossible. but even in the 2012 series  she is traditionally pretty. she in thin and active looking. she looked like she could keep pace with the turtles. this one looks like she would be a massive hindrance to them if if the foot where to attack. she would not be able to out run them. and she would get captured.though even more then how april looks  seeing seth rogen s name at the front of it  makes more unsure about this movie.
honestly  they could have made her look like meadow or carmen in the entergalactic movie on netflix. but no  they made the choice with all the character design variety they probably made for her. they chose this design for their iteration
looks more like the body frame is wrong  closer to a 4  person s frame. all the turtles look a little oddly shaped too. that aside  how old is she and the turtles suppose to be in this  they seem like early teen not late teen like they typically are depicted. april in the  rise  show is way younger...  i think that s one of the problems with more and more of these april approaches. making her close to the turtles in age makes things more  nope  to me. she s suppose to be older and already out in the adult human world  not a teen. that makes people talking about her attractiveness super creepy to me. she s 16 at the start of  rise  so people talking about her looks is really bad.
me in 2018  there can t possibly be a worst april o neal than megan fox.
when it comes to taste in what is considered  beautiful   i ve always liked the sexy yet flawed approach. like the girl with a knockout body  but she also has a big nose  that sort of thing. too bad they couldn t have gone with that and instead decided to just go full-ugly with this version of april.
we went from megan fox april o neil to shaquille o neil.
i saw a video a few months ago by patience xina who pointed out how hollywood keeps changing the race of red haired characters and i can t unsee it now. this is just another example but they did it with the little mermaid  the witcher  spider-man  teen titans. it s really weird how they re going out of their way to specifically erase redheads.
all the  it s a kids show lmao  are literally creaming themselves about how  epic  it looks and how they can t wait to see it. no self awareness as always.
@adam  so true. so so true lol. it s going to take more than a bunch of fancy effects and visuals to impress us with a higher than room temperature iq. we want faithful lore and art styles  that should be the lowest bar set in movie and game development.
thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  you bet!
he s also not fictional
yes i too wish to be dicapio who sits in a castle while telling poor people to live in smaller houses because carbon footprint apparently lol.not to say the guy isn t a great actor of course but i had to make that joke.
there is no fight
she could still be a big sister to the turtles
@animezilla 44  yes  but without her actually being older and so having the mother figure side to her it dose change the dynamic. this was something that was in 2012. most of them treated april like a sister  but because she was not older then them  they did not respect her as the older versions did april. so it could work  and has with 2012. but the dynamic is changed.
it doesn t look bad  what s wrong
i actually like the newer ones where they made her a combatant alongside the turtles and casey. but they did the girl dirty on this one.
found your channel from this video.. love your opinion and agree
not only melonie would be awesome tinkerbell  she would be fantastic april o neil. only hair needs some red.
i personally feel like april should be able bodied because there are many instances of her in multiple parts of the series where she is a martial artist. if someone trained as a martial artist as often as she does in the series  she would be fit. the one explanation for this i could see is that this is supposed to be april before she started training with master splinter  and her training improved her health.
let s blackify  let s uglyify. stunning and brave.
good call with the nico reference  she is hot as hell in design and personality while also being outside of the norm supermodel look personality voice.  nico is great cuz she is full of personality.  this april is so far not full of personality.
melonie looks more like april than the new official one.also tattooed girls is not my type but i d give exceptions to nico and melonie.
melonie mac    i hope i can be as beautiful as april one day! hope achieved.
am i the only one who thinks people like this freaking out is a little funny. like  the character looks fine. it s a reboot  things will be changed. i don t even see what s  bad  about the design.
sorry. this april is a tricky character to say you race swaped her to black. the original 2 creator of ninja turtles  argued over weather april was black or white to the point that her race was changed based on who was drawing the comics.
april was hot so they had to tone her down out of jealousy.
melonie uploaded a new video so i must show support god bless u sis glad ur doing well u look great btw keep up the great work
would of been funny if she was a brunette who went into the sewer in a homemade yellow hazmat suit in order to follow up a lead on finding the mysterious turtle saviors but is a bit of a germaphobe as a wink to that jumpsuit she wore. or her suit is just a space heroine cosplay she wears throughout the film  something she can relate to leo if he still into those syfy hero shows like his other incarnations  as things get crazy. here she is just some young overweight potiental femcel who may have a abrasive know it all attitude. hopefully the film gives her a stunning attitude that helps the boys than constantly demean them for laughs. bring some of the campiness afterschool stuff back to eaze the grit. afterall they got their letter name belts are back  so the campy uplifting goodness should be the way than little girl know it all snark. we do not need another bummer velma clone.
stacey abram as april o neil
also noteworthy  one turtle has braces... because clearly dentists work in sewers.as for april  i think that is the reason this iteration is called  mutant mayhem .unfortunately they ignore the fact april is the face of the media company she works for.can you please apply for the next live action tmnt movie series as april  your tattoos can easily be covered or explained in the storyline. you re 1000  more april than the disrespectful mutant mayhem!
i think the real question is  why do so many equate being average with being  ugly   she is not ugly. she is average and that s the point. she doesn t have to be conventionally and stereotypically attractive in order for her to play a strong and meaningful role in the story.that s what made the michael bay tmnt so frustratingly annoying. they picked meghan fox to play april and both figuratively and literally focused the entire movie on her and how hot she is. meanwhile  the turtles themselves were given less screentime  fewer lines  and their actors were actually treated like garbage on-set.now  that was admittedly just one of the reasons why the bay-verse tmnt was cringe  but let s be honest. april being hot or sexually attractive adds nothing of value to the actual story of tmnt  which was traditionally always more about how gritty the story and art was  rather than about making the characters attractive or not.
omg  they velma ed her to death!
in my opinion health is beauty and vice-versa. we find attractive healthy looking people. signs of weakness or disease we naturally find to be unattractive but sometimes we unnaturally find ourselves attracted even to  people that display signs of bad health. like for example i find girls wearing glasses very attractive  even though is bad health to need glasses when not past middle age.
10 28one  other thing is would she be able to handle herself in action  without losing her breath
april o neil is a reference to kevin eastman girlfriend back when tmnt was being made.  1984  in the mirage comics she was seen as dark skin volume  11
just full of food
who s nico
@cj gamer  she s from devil may cry 5
thank you so much!
thank you!! it s so sad so many people are butt hurt that teenage april o neil isn t beautiful sexually attractive enough  i honestly love her hair and the glasses! she s chubby but  so what lol
what made the megan foxx thing so annoying is that she can t act. not her appearance.
@hb real  you make my point. the fact that she was hot did absolutely nothing to save fox s version from being awful. the strength of the performance is more impactful and important to the character than her looks.
this might explain why supermodels aren t that attractive since they are heavily surgically altered sometimes to wearing too much makeup to having fake implants.its just not attractive or healthy looking.
we didn t go to the mall on the weekends to play turtles  or watch the big kids play  to save splinter or  save the world  ha ha  we knew why. that cartoon picture on the right is cute too
i knew wokeness was coming when i heard seth rogan was involved
seth rogen is producing this  so i have no intention on watching this
plot twist they are secretly prepping her up to be the next female mutant ninja turtle  she ll fit right in lol
i didn t even realise it was her until i started seeing videos in it. i guess that s what happens when you don t even recognise a character
april is officially an elf.link s race.
you are right  this is on purpose.good on you for bringing up eric july s video on it  too.
i don t see her as  ugly .  i ll take personality over  conventional beauty standards  in any fictional character any day.  sure its good to be healthy but we re talking about cartoon characters  not women s fitness  the turtles themselves don t follow  conventional beauty standards  and everyone loves them  but hey  everyone is entitled to their opinion of course.
but... we ve never had an  ugly  april
hell if we talk about redesings even reboot lara was gorgeous  this is just....goddamn i have no words
ok but the turtleverse exists and there s always gonna be different iterations of the characters. april s design is just ok  there could have been more work around it.
i am glad you said that. i personally do not like april model. she is just not what i envision from the april i remember. i think hollywood has ran out of ideas this is why we have so many damn remakes. i remember a time when hollywood was so damn creative! now  hollywood  you need to bring  back the spark of creativity. movies suck  they have been like this since the new millennium. it s just awful. i haven t been excited for a new movie for a long time.
wait!! i completely forgot you covered this almost a year earlier. . . . .!wow  the tides of time have been unkind to someone who was fine all the time - and yeah i tried to rhyme right through the entire time. . . great video as always  melonie mac! go boom!
ok but why is her being  attractive  important
if you re a redhead in hollywood  you may as well have a bullseye on your forehead.
that ain t april - that s bern  vern and irma all rolled into one.
can someone please explain to me why we can t have big busted hot april o neill wearing a yellow jumpsuit that works as a news reporter  that was the best one.
apparently in the comics she was originally based on the creators biracial girlfriend and wasn t a redhead just found that out
this happened because  seth rogan. one of the most woke celebrities on the planet. he was is the driving force behind this film. the best thing about this movie is that jackie chan was cast as splinter.
can t wait to see who this self insert was made after  especially after the velma fanfic by an insufferable mental case. this looks to be no different
but we had april fools
its only a matter of time until they come for jessica rabbit
exactly my thought. everyone s concerned with how they can t be horned up if the character is black or a bit thick. but that shouldn t even matter  because the character is a teenager.
didnt know shaquille o neil was of irish scottish descent
the new april makes krang look beautiful
its not as blatant but  they did something similar to aloy in horizon forbidden west. they made her face much more masculine
r.i.p classic april
this feels like it might be another one of those self-insert characters  like that  i am not starfire  comic from a couple years ago.
and yet  despite looking like she d start panting and wheezing if she lifted a potato chip slightly too fast  i can guarantee that they ll have her running and jumping around just as well as the actual mutant ninjas she hangs out with. ah  who am i kidding  she s a high melanin type b  so of course she s going to be the real hero of the whole thing.
that s not april o neal  end of the story.
you are a very based woman. i respect that. good vids good channel
i d love to see the a.i. version of the black o neal honestly.
i suppose it depends how old she is. considering the turtles sound and look younger  she might look like that because she s a literal child  and saying she needs to be hot is eeeeeeee
she seems like to be the bullied kid that learns martial arts trope.
her job was a reporter on tv she has to be attractive
she s a cartoon character. if people are really looking at animated characters to be attracted to  that s sad.
i have the original 80s cartoon on dvd. i have no motivation to watch an updated version  regardless. i should pick up the original comics graphic novels. i can only imagine this happens because terrible writers and directors want to inject their insecurities onto the screen and normalize what makes them angry instead of working on their craft. i can imagine the producer was all  can t wait to see the hot renderings of april.  walks into the meeting  see this shit  and knows if he she says anything to these sensitive people  he she might lose their job or get cancelled.
i don t get why they would make april look like that. the creators of that movie probably didn t think that people would care that much about april s look but now people are fully hating on the new design and i agree with the people. creators of different movies  shows  and comics of the tmnt constantly change april s design which can get really annoying really fast. people like april s design but some other people disagree with the other people and i constantly change my opinion about april s different designs.
she was an active  late 80 s fitness girl with volumed hair. i thought she was based off of the actresses in private school 1983. she was irish  hung out with turtles  and was stalked by casey jones.
poor april fell into the mutagen and got turned into a shrew.
diabetic april better not be eating any of the turtle s pizza!
the velma comparison is so true. fairly sure she ll have that same kinda personality too.
shh  don t tell them that black people can have that style of name. it ll short circuit their brain.
hahaha
they could have at least used the  rise of the tmnt  april... she was an ok april.
that s your opinion everybody has a different take on the character if you don t like the design that s fine
frrr
i do love the art style in the new movie coming out  definitely reminds me of van goghs stretched out style  or a french wine oil painting. i agree with your points 100   i kinda zoned out on her beauty standards when i saw her in the trailer cause companies in general are making woman less beautiful for the human eyes and idk why. i think the same would go for sailormoon  shes utterly stunning and is supposed to be. i think many many people would be upset if they changed her extensively to not be her iconic self.
the most recent april was raceswapped but also attractive lol.
were the teenage turtles teenaged in human years or turtle years ... because assuming that the mutations don t limit their lifespan they d live to 150 so their teenage years would be their 30s
was hoping to see april  instead i got march
i miss the 2003 series
i ve been like a broken record saying this  but imo the real shame is that historically the turtles kinda transcended race and were generally loved by all regardless of background and ethnicity. but now in this iteration race has been dragged into it and is dominating the conversation. now instead of potentially being a unifying thing fans could come together on it s just another thing dividing people. feelsbadman
hollywood really hates us redheads. first mj  now april.
they should ve just gone ahead and made her a mutant turtle.
i remember growing up with the original cartoon.  it came out when i was 7  and i remember little boys at school having a crush on april.  no chance of that now.  good job  rogen  you have truly saved society. get woke go broke  can t wait to watch this travesty crash and burn like santa  inc.
half the job of a cartoon character is to look good.
being black has been viewed in western countries as conventionally unattractive generally. i know this because some people will reject you without even knowing what you look like if they know you are black and if you ask them what is it about black people that makes them unattractive  most of them will likely say that they just never found black people attractive. so race does play a part in it to some degree as far as conventional attractiveness for some people. also  skin bleaching is very popular in some parts of asia and even some parts of africa. though you ll never find any skin bleaching products or treatments for obvious reasons even though there are a ton of skin tanning products and treatments.
the original is what they should be trying to match in my opinion
i thought that mikey  leo  don  and raph were supposed to be the mutant turtles... not april...
it should be clarified  that they say that his wife was of mixed race  that is  african-american and white  but here is something that many do not know  kevin said that it was based on his name  nothing else  the reason why he had a change in future comics it can be seen in his documentary turtle power where he explains that he was based on the name of his high school love  and later his wife  where he did start to touch his appearance  but in comic number 2 of mirage vol 1 it is explained that she is a redhead since in the fourth issue of the same volume  april is presented with a change in her hair color and she left curls like african-americans  but that was a fashion at the time  for god s sake   that s why in other issues she is seen like this  but he only did that  he only changed his hair  never his skin or never had features of an afro-american or mixed woman  this change was only made so that kevin had an excuse to pay this tribute to his wife  that is  if she is white but they only took the hair as inspiration and the name  never its app  appearance  even though in the translation and dubbing of the documentary they make the mistake that kevin says that he relied entirely on her so don t confuse people  but the idea of   making her african-american was never had  that is  it s a mistake that they never understood or they read. in addition  the character is peter laird s  since he had the idea before  in fact they wanted her as asian  never afro  the only idea that was had of her was only white and asian  to find out more information read the comic that kevin wrote that is kevin eastman s teenage mutant ninja turtles artobiography and the documentary and there they will know the truth
and i bet she is extremely arrogant and empowered  i also bet that in the final scene of the movie she shows up and saves everyone  as well as every  woke  character in the last 10 years.
well atleast the turtles wont be fighting over her
still the best one!
@fejkpirat  exactly i prefer my april beautiful and white with red hair not wearing an ugly yellow jumpsuit she was hotter in the 03 series and i prefer my turtles not to be clowns and actually take things seriously like ..the original mirage comics
i might know an animator i just need to get voice actors but i m thinking about doing an r rated panel by panel animated adaption of the original comics it ll be black and white other than the red masks on the turtles and the blood hopefully i can get some contacts on board with this
i miss 2012.
i miss rise of the teenage mutant ninja turtles
@cj gamer  dear god i hope u aren t serious with that one
@crystalx oof  2012 was decent but i preferred the 03 series since it was closer to the source material
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   no i am serious with that one
@cj gamer  same  i miss rise tmmt
when i saw the pictures i didn t even know that was april until i live stream i was watching mentioned it
everybody thought aldous huxley s  brave new world  won the dystopia cup  but it was actually vonnegut s  harrison bergeron
i wish gifs were allowed on youtube because i would totally use the peter griffin  omg who the hell cares!!  one
she almost looks like seth rogen
i think the people upset about april being black are very few  and just being publicized by woke journalists. most people are just irritated that she s not cute.it s a kids  tmnt movie  so i don t care that much. i hope the other characters are fun and it will make a good show to watch with my daughter.now if they made the tmnt movie that i m wishing they would  somewhere between batman the animated series and the hbo spawn series and sourced from the original comics  than i would be absolutely pissed with this april. no problem with her being black  just that she looks a frumpy little protester...i d make her look like betty davis
you forgot what they did to little mermaid... soon no redheads left...
@jim man-beard  she s actually still a redhead. it s just a natural ginger hair color instead of the bright red she had before. still sad that her hair wouldn t be a bright red color anymore tho.
it applies to all races  people are far more likely to marry someone from their own race. in fact  only 10  of marriages in us are interracial.
they ve actually done studies on this and black women and asian men are always voted as the least attractive.
@adu1991  wonderful  you found one example  all studies are null   void haha. of course there s going to be examples where this isn t the case  but as a whole on a larger scale that s what has been found.
aren t black women very liked by men in western countries
@hazatroll eople choose what they choose.the last time i was in a thread sort of like this it was with a woman insisting interracial marriage is sinful and evil.good times.
@chandller burse  thankfully we re past those times.
@chandller burse  ah  where did i say anything about asian women  i said black women and asian men. asian woman are at the top of the list  i can t remember where exactly they were  but i think they were either 1st or 2nd.
@notjafar  what times
@infamyordeath -__-  and i meant that the female of the groups are still very sought after.i never said you said anything about the women.
@chandller burse  you just contradicted yourself. you said  white pretty women should be disliked...   why would anyone dislike a pretty woman
@80 s nostalgia guy  i said they would be disliked then since thats the fair stereotype today.i am too irate to argue specifics about what i said on stupid youtube channels.
@adu1991  stop being annoying by intentionally misinterpreting what i said. just because beautiful black women exist doesn t mean that racist people don t exist or biased people don t exist. not sure how i can explain it more elementary than that.
@80 s nostalgia guy  it s also the way black people and minorities are portrayed in media and culture.
april would be the character who singlehandedly supported and motivated the turtles to do a lot of good... she was a status symbol of female empowerment!this april will just demotivate them and talk down to the turtles.. it really is a reskin of mindy s velma!they could not even come up with a new and creative character for diversity.
no i haven t seen this  thanks god!i don t want her to be like the original one  but just draw her a little more  let s say  human . and she doesn t look very feminine as you said. the distribution of body mass. and of course i also thought she was older  not a teen. april  i never thought of her as a beautiful anything  because she was the turtle s friend or something  and i never quite liked her outfit. and at that time it was a cliche stereotype.  beautiful . it s not a question of beauty  it s a drawing  an animated character. just make the new april more human. with that style she looks odd more than ugly
they made april cute and black in rise of the tmnt  2018  and they also wrote her well. but here s thing thing about rise  it s more of a reimagining than a reboot. the creators of that show expressed as much. april from rise is probably one of my favorites just because she was written with so much personality and heart and she played a wonderful support role as a semi-sister figure to the turtles. mutant mayhem hasn t given us enough to tell if the writing will be good or not. given that quite a few of the celebrity actors are not good voice actors  including seth himself  i m concerned that the movie will be all style and no substance.11 29 there s a gif of 2018 april dancing away that cracks me up every time. edit  the art style is jarring at first  it s not similar to steven universe at all  but oh my gosh does it look amazing in action scenes. the art was what kept me away from it until i bit the bullet and marathoned it. it s underrated af and it was done dirty by nickelodeon.
idk what everyone s freaking out about. it s the classic team of leo donny mikey raph and bruce vilanch!
this is hilarious.  it s almost satire.
2 20 oh hey  that works for an alternate reality o neil.
creators  we want the geek girls to relate to the characters and not feel ashamed by looking at hot charactersall men opening tik tok   instagram and looking cosplays or geek girls up
it s made by seth rogen  the guy behind that bad christmas movie
why is the  better  version of her skinny and whitewashed  u could ve kept her cubb  locs  and glasses but apparently those things are ugly  not like it matters
i don t know why  but all i see when i look at her  is something like velma. by design  and the way she s acting  she looks more like a self-insert of the actress  then anything. which has been a problem with shows  like the wingfeather saga  where they changed a characters personality and appearance to match the voice-actress in a book adaption. instead of keeping faithful to the actual character.
just bring adult april back. i don t even know why teen april is still a thing. she was an adult in the 80 s cartoon. an adult in the 2003 one as well. even in the 2007 movie she wasn t an adult. she s never been a teen in any the live action movies. i think 2012 started that for some reason. she doesn t need to be close to the turtles ages to hang out with them.
they wanted april to look like seth rogen
they should have just leaned into it and made april a sumo wrestler.
yeah  i hate that they keep doing this to attractive ladies in fiction. it s ridiculous.
i am a black female and i am heartbroken with how they ve depicted her in this new film. why is it that whenever a dark-skinned  black female character is included in a property  she automatically has to be overweight   shapeless  and masculine  they have april shaped like a potato. this is a woman who literally runs around with ninja. and in this iteration she appears to be a reporter  she isn t always   and reporters are usually running around chasing leads for stories and generally in good shape. i m sorry  but i just don t buy an  out of shape  april. i was already not looking forward to this film  just based on seth rogan s involvement. but me being a huge ninja turtles fan  i was still willing to take a chance on it. but after seeing the travesty of what they have done to april  i won t even bother. the sad thing is that i can t even openly complain about this  because i get attacked and accused of being  fat-phobic . if they were going to make april black  why couldn t she be a cute  petite  in shape black chick the way white april is always portrayed as a cute  petite  in-shape white chick  why must black april be out of shape and masculine
my problem with this movie is i feel like it will be the same origin story but with a new coat of paint on it. i m honestly sick of seeing this over and over again which is a shame because the rise tmnt movie told a great story. it did something new by taking a bit more of a serious tone and having more at stake for the heroes. if you don t like rise that is fine but at least they tried to do something new with the turtles.
april is a redhead white girl. the girl in rise of the tmnt  2018  is aperil  not april. just like tinkerbell is white and blonde  unlike tinkerblack who is black with brown hair.
@stankey poosea  again  it s a reimagining. not a reboot. the creators worked on the 2012 reboot and they said they wanted to change a lot of things in their new project and they really did. personally  i thought the ideas they had were really cool and refreshing. i give them a pass on april because they went in with the intention to make rise it s own unique thing. is it tmnt proper  no but it was never meant to be.
@stankey poosea  expect she s modeled after one of the creator s wife who is biracial. it was the 80s tv show that changed it to her current red head white girl.rise was a fun show and the animation was great  but the story... i was it was more inline with the movie  which was fantastic! i loved the new takes on powers too. rise felt very fresh.
nobody taught me what s beautiful  what s the  standard . even as a kid i just knew which people looked pleasing to the eyes. it might sound controversial  but in my personal opinion  there s a certain  objectivity  to what beautiful is.
we should be more worried about her character not her physicality it s sad that people are upset about this
the modern media outlets are definitely trolling at this point. this is them giving the middle finger to fans of all these classic franchises. they aren t creating new content but using established franchises to twist for the single purpose of upsetting those who grew up on it.
i agree. since michael bay turtles i haven t been excited about turtles .
there was a black april before  also just admit you don t like her because she s black velma isn t funny because she screams about how black she is while april is just a normal human being with dark skin who isn t screaming about how black she is
@breezy bunny  there was a black april before  uh  yeah  duh. april o neil from rise  who s design  by comparison  is way better. at least in s2. but they kind of gave her the short end of the stick in the movie  by changing it back to her rather bad and basic design. so no  i don t hate her because she s black. i hate her  for the reasons i ve stated above  and for the fact that i know many people who could make a better design. her design here just looks bland  and its just dark brown on brown backgrounds  and that s not a good look. there s a reason why the turtles have bright bandanas  after all. i wouldn t have minded the dark skin  if it wasn t so dark that she completely merges with the background. the problem is she needs a brighter clothes design  like the previous aprils. rise s april s green design worked  because the lighting and animation was really bright  so that it never became a problem  but here  it doesn t. at least add some white  or yellow  or orange. its honestly disgusting to look at  as an artist myself.
@dragonsman  2d   3d animation are 2 different things  what you just said about her being so dark she blends in with the background is not only not true but also extremely racist. you are making her skin color the problem when in reality it s the light source whenever shining on the 3d model of april. you don t like the color scheme nor the lighting in some scenes but that doesn t makes her design ugly at all. another thing is the shading contrasted with the lighting that makes the colors look like that which is the way the entire movie is. april o neil s design is fine the colors compliment each other   not being to tumblr colored   her clothing style being the way actual people dress. the color scheme of the movie is dark colors anyways
i m just a kid can use on why people think that her wearing a jacket and beanie is  masculine
yeah
even the video games like shredder s revenge or the cowabunga collection
it s seth rogen messed up mind.
you are so right. i remember the ninja turtles cartoons in my youth. the cartooms weren t good but nice. doing this to another memory makes me sad. naturally i will ignore. the creator of this version of april seems to hate afro american girls.
1987 april was the most sensual.2012 april was the most cutest.2003 april was the closest to the original comics.however everything after 2017 has gone downhill since.
she looks like a 47 year old single mother of 6 who works in a plumbing office  handing out the devices to plumbers when they head out to work a job every morning
how can they screw it so bad having a cool video game not so long ago where april even is a playable character
when i first saw this new april i thought it was splinter lmao
who cares for april im watching it for the turtles
i think we all should just let it happen first. this seems like the first to really feel like they are teenagers by there voices. i m not sure if we even should be looking at it like this. at the end of the day  it s a cartoon. about walking talking turtles as shredder would say lol. don t hate me for saying this but i don t think we should be looking at a cartoon and feeling some attractiveness to her. i m sure they wanted to make sure it stood out from the other shows and movies throughout the years. now if they took the turtles and turned them to penguins then yea. be upset.  im just saying  it s april. that s it. i see some jessica rabbit comments in here and let me say this  jessica rabbit...wanted to bang a rabbit. on nickelodeons website it says shes 16. so...she s a child. there all kids. let s not try and wonder why a 16 year old in a cartoon doesn t look attractive. that s gross. just...gross.
i m so glad i just bought the entire original series it s about time i take that out and watch it  haven t seen it since i was 4.
well...when you eat pizza for every meal ..oh wait.... that s the turtles...
i really don t understand why people are getting so offended by there designs...i honestly really love april s design and everyone s else s. and i can t tell if people are serious or joking.. because i love love this april s design with a burning passion. i could explain why i love this april but then again i don t really want to and some of yall might end up fighting...
when they casted megan foxx as april o neil. i was like that s megan foxx not april o neil.
you an adult woman talking about the body shape of a child
the modern audience doesn t even care about the characters so they wouldn t care about what they look like.
now why didn t they just make her irma  she looks like she could be irma more so than april. what a missed opportunity. at least the turtles  bebop  rocksteady and splinter looks good. splinter especially with his new mullet.
damn they pulled a mindy on april
the race swap isn t a problem the best version of april was in rise of the tmnt and she was black the character design of the new movie one could be far better though
after watching the trailer i just kept wokndering why was velma in the tmnt
if these wokies destroy any more of the hot animated women from my childhood  i swear by everything holy that i m going to start paying all my attention to hot real women!hey... melonie... how s it goin   you lookin  fiiiiiine  girl...
tmnt in 2012 was in my opinion was the best series
exactly finally someone who gets it i never cared about april she s the most boring character of any tmnt thing so i naturally wouldn t care about her design the movie is called ninja turtles not april
that s the first thing that came to mind when i saw this april should up i thought she was april s boy obsessed best friend irma
i feel bad for casey jones having to hide the fact that he s dating that.
it looks like april touched some of that ooze and got mutated.
the turtles used to have to save april from kidnapping in the games. imagine summoning the will to save this version from shredder. no thanks.
they just crapped out april and animated it i mean what the hell happened bro !
i used to have a crush on april as a child.  shame to see they destroyed my childhood memory of her
i personally don t have a problem with the race swap  given the fact that --- like all comic book characters  there are many different versions of certain characters  and when they re adapted into movies  they usually look different than how we usually see them. then again  i can t deny that she looks like she s built like humpty dumpty.
if people want characters that  represent them  how do they cope with a fps game
bro she s probably like 14 in the movie. chill.
of course they ve made april black  wasn t she originally a redhead  april o neill was one of the hottest toon girls ever... of all time. right up there with fujiko mine of lupin 3rd.
did april swim through mutagen and join the master of disguise in th turtle club or something
great to see a new video  melonie. hope you have a wonderful day. you look very beautiful
the modern audience doesn t make up even half of the audience for these properties with the fact that they will never be happy with any changes cause it will never be enough
this show has doa written all over it.
i think it s crazy to not agree with everything you said. whether people wanna agree with it or not it s just actual facts. of course they re gonna take it out of context and make it sound like your bein insensitive
yeah  i was in a similar boat. i was more up upset about the race swap again. but you also brought up good points. i didn t think much of it at first  i acknowledged it but i came to realize they did make her ugly. i despise that we are deliberately making characters unattractive  just to represent people. i m latino and i want just as much representation as the next guy  but i want the fantasy or idealized version of me  not actual me. also where is my redhead love  i will argue that many black people have celtic and french last names  so the name isn t a bother but being a redhead is like a hallmark trait of scottish or irish people  bringhotredheadsback
this
damn i didn t know shaquille o neil was irish.
it s velma 2.0
this is diabetes... i love this channel!
the original comic book artists want their franchise back.that is what i would do if i was them.
april o neil is supposed to counter balance the turtles  as they are not  handsome  she s supposed to be pretty to show that a  pretty  person can see the great things on someone that isnt  basically a beauty and the beast outlook to give an example to other s not to judge when someone above beauty standards  this  now i dont even know whos the beast
it makes sense that they did this period how else are they going to accurately represent april o neal as the modern reporter  i m guessing they ve made her a reporter for the mary sue.
they went out of their way to make her  i dunno  i don t think she s ugly  she looks well  plain. i dunno how to describe it. looks like a random person off the street.
why does april o neal look like the new velma
melanie mac  april o niel... both irish names... i vote you should apply to play april!!! now i d pay a lot to see that... i think you would make a great april!  kick starter to make less woke media  lmao...i love your content... go boom!
i m sorry    did you not see the close-up shot of her eyes   absolutely stunning!of course she isn t conventionally attractive  but who cares. i  personally  find her very attractive and soft. also  people who are of this weight aren t automatically unhealthy. like wtf  there are people who look like the original 80 s april  but there are also people who look like this new april. neither one is bad or wrong  so take off the nostalgia glasses and stop hating on new designs of the character we all know and love.
at first i thought you were on a race thing but then i watched it through before assuming things
why is this a controversial thing  april was already race swapped in rise of the ninja turtles.did mayhem combine april with irma
she got velma d lol
obviously the race swap was because she had red hair  the weight increase . . . they do seem to be trying to normalize that.
it s not even that she has to be hot  i just don t want april to look like she ll lecture me on pronouns.....that being said  she s hanging out with mutant ninjas  no fat or chubby person would be able to hang with a group of ninjas and keep up.
the funny thing is  april s design is the most inconsistent of any iconic character i ve ever seen  but we always know her when we see her. my favorite design is the 2003 version  cause i grew up with that   but the rise version is cute too. at least she felt like april  even if she looks more like an irma blend . this new frumpy dumpy is just ugly. and calling that april is just offensive.
1970s  foxy brown2023  fatty brown
who knew the ideal body type was weeblewobble
but she is brave and empowering
she is not ugly are y all ok
when i was a kid  i watched sly stallone and clint eastwood movies because i wanted to be them. nobody  in their right mind  is gonna look at this april and think   hey i wanna look just like that.  and if they do  good luck with the diabeetus and mental health issues that come from poor diet and lack of exercise.
you used to have a subtle message.... gorgeous girl befriends the mutants and isn t put off. one of beautiful people can interact with and care about people who just do not fit in. but no... they had to make her ugly. because that s how she fits in with the mutants  right
man i can t believe they that like that   i was so hype up about this about movie cause i though they going do it right but i seen it look mess up but we re going see when it come out
10 43 all 4 of these pictures are better than the mutant mayhem version...
she is supposed to at some point be useful in a fight . that ain t happening looking like that
alsoi m seeing other people comment about how she is a minor and they have a point! why are you getting all wound up about how attractive a teenager looks  like chill out.  also i m a minor so that s why i said she was attractive to me second  well i guess thirdly at this point smh calling rise of the tmnt  cheap and lazy     are you kidding me  when the 80 s show that you so clearly adore used copy and paste versions of the turtles and like a he-man level of different frames. no hate to the 80 s show  i love it too  but just the hypocrisy is insane.
she wasn t originally a redhead lmao
@kidcourage  doesn t matter she s been a redhead or reddish brown in 90  of the cartoons  films  toys and other adaptions for decades. grab a random person off the street and they ll probably say redhead reporter describing her. do a google search for her and most of the results will show redhair. so like all redheads she must become a black person. as i recall the turtles all originally all had red masks not different coloured ones yet no one s saying they should go back to that like they seem to be with april.
@liam warner  can t lie you do have a point about the redhead thing  ig they rlly do love turning them black
can you believe that she use the word masculine to describe her when she s not even masculine
its literally a fictional teenager lmao. so bothered
as a huge og tmnt fan this is irritating. i don t care what race she is but as you said  she s supposed to be attractive! in the last animated series most of donnie s motivations were to impress april. in the original movie raph was embarrassed to admit he had a crush on her and mikey was kissing his tv. there s not a single teenager that would have a crush on this april.
i m literally a die-hard fan of tmnt  i ve got a plethora of merch  clothes  and all the games movies  and to top it off  whenever tmnt is mentioned around her  my mom is always proud to tell anyone who listens that my first word was  cowabunga ... this makes me sick. like utterly revolted. once again  the woke left sinks their fangs into something i love and grew up with. i want to spout some very violent and nasty things  but i m not gonna give the fem-soy-they-them-xers a reason to accuse tmnt fans of being extremists. i don t even care about her being black  there s been black versions of april  and like melonie said  race swapping is sucky and racist in itself  but not nearly as messed up as this. why not introduce a new original character with this design instead  why destroy april in such a disgusting way  oh that s right  because women aren t allowed to be beautiful anymore  not in media at least.  avert the male gaze at all costs!  i hope jeff rowe and seth rogen get uncontrollable explosive diarrhea and profuse anal leakage during every party  premier  and family event for the rest of their lives.
it s so fuckin sad..it s so crazy because i literally look like april  built like her as well. all my fricken life  now those same bullys are adults on the media  with a platform. like i love april...i can cosplay her withot feeling off. i m fricken dressing up as her for halloween. like damn...it makes me sad  another reason why i don t wanna join the cosplay community..for the fact that you have to be  sexy  as a cosplaying minor to be cosplaying right. sad.
the new april just looks like a frumpy background character. what makes characters stand out is they maybe attractive looking or have distinct features and make them recognizable.
april used to be a news reporter......now she s got a body for radio
why are you calling rise of the teenage mutant ninja turtles  a lazy cheap art style have you seen the animation  it s not lazy at all.
this is more telling of the creators than anything else. they didn t just make her frumpy... they made her black and frumpy...creators biases have been revealed
somebody inserted themselves into the tmnt universe . i d honestly like to see who made this
uglyfied april o neil ryan reynolds  but why
why race swap old characters   make new ones.   on an another topic  i m liking the hair down look melonie!  so wavy!!!
wasn t she already black for that one tmnt show where raphael was the leader
theyre teenagers bro damn y all hating on a kids movie
2003 tmnt was the goat.
i remember criticizing april s design in rise  which ended up being a decent series.  i d take rise april over this.
she is not ugly she is special
she s 13 in this film
and why tf are you looking for a hot character in a child cartoon
seth rogan!  if you see his name in a production  you gonna know it s woke.
too bad it has to be the creators want her to be not that attractive but she still unique character above flaws.
it literally says  a new generation  in the trailer  because woah  get this  children are usually the target audience of tmnt! woah! crazy! it s a cartoon! no kid is gonna give a damn about how she looks
make sure we all criticize this together like we did with the sonic movie.  paramount listened.  let s hope paramount does the same for april o neil.  they have time.
true the kids are watching it for the turtles so i don t get the criticism it doesn t matter what april looks like
@m  exactly! and the only people that are complaining are adults all worked up that they changed their favorite character  using that as an excuse to be a jerk about how someone looks. like that s so immature.
@kami   exactly and i was a kid too who watched ninja turtles and never gave a damm about april
i m gonna say it and i will die on that hill  donnie should not wear glasses.
this new april looks like hbo max velma
the 90s cartoon certainly influenced this for me  but i always thought of april having irish heritage  with the red hair and o neil being her last name. pretty typical for someone with that heritage to be white  on top of everything else they ve ignored here. seth rogen s name at the beginning of the trailer really was a red flag for me  so i wasn t shocked  just disappointed.
is it just me or does april look like joy reid lol.
i remember 6 year old me being pissed that the 1990 s movie april was not like the cartoon. i guess i was born  an isto phobe.
another redhead killed off. i remember when melonie had that pink red hair  it was awesome
for real  i m not even offended by the character design if it was a different character altogether that could be introduced in this iteration of tmnt.   but that design is not april. not even close.
april was a hottest woman in child cartoon ever
i knew there will be a catch with the new tmnt movie. it s bad enough seth rogan is directing it. his last movies doesn t out shine sausage party either.
seth rogan apparently learned nothing from the disaster of his last animated movie.
totally makes sense all the turtles would be crushing over her looking like a troll
let s be real  they are never going to stop until they can no longer make enough money off of it. i know  i know  somehow they still get money  but the less we feed into it  the less financially viable it will become.
her being black isn t actually that weird  since she was originally black in the comics  which most people don t know they only changed her for the 80s show  they also changed her for the colorized covers  but she was intended to be black  the comics weren t in color before though . her being a fat little girl instead of a tall beautiful black woman in a yellow jumpsuit is just bonkers to me  she shouldn t be fat  she shouldn t be a kid  she shouldn t be unattractive  some overweight girls are also attractive  but the way they made her is just  i m not starfire  and  velma  all over again. idk why they gave her glasses either that s just stupid
they just can t leave anything alone.
melonie   i hope i could be as beautiful as her some day every dude and lesbian on this channel   crushed it
the beautiful hot feminine visual in video games  movies etc. is all over. it s gonna keep happen
cause they re stuck on a narrative lol
the tmnt appeal is in their nostalgia. so when they  modernize  everything  it s just gonna alienate the core audience. we all know why they changed april. but  this will not give them the audience that they want. this will fall flat and get rebooted again. next time  mickey may be drag and that ll fail too.
keep being honest!we need more honesty in today s society10 35 the ai is called midjourney  it is really really great tool for conceptual design
aprils been eating too many pizza
i think the 1990s movie april didn t have the best interpretation of april and she was maybe one of the least impressive parts of the movie. don t get me wrong  i like her acting abilities and this version of april is still solid  but it s not particularly her when i think back of the greatness of the 1990s turtles movie. costume design  the music  the action choreography  shredder  casey jones and the humor were way more memorable in this film.
i m highly offended because my beard is ginger.
this made me laugh so hard. good one. lol
she was never black in the comics. i mean the name  april o neil  should have clued you in on that. eastman based her on his current girlfriend.
they can t call tmnt fans racist. when they made baxter stockman black  as he was in the original mirage comics in the 2003 show and the michael bay films after over decade of him being race-swapped to white in the most iconic version of the franchise  turtles fans applauded it. not for sjw reasons  but because it s true to the source.
they made her   irma o neil and she weighs 2 women and changed her skin colour lol
i like this version of april and think they did a great job!
i guess this confirms april loves all of that pizza as well.
the ninja turtles act more like children than the awesome teens they are supposed to be. wtf!
she s cute. yeah  if you re blind.
april was younger in 2012  looked good. april was younger in 2018. looked stupid  because they gave her the dumbest hair  and irma s classes   still didn t look like that.  younger  isn t an excuse.
how dare you slander velma o  neil
dang.
unrelated  your hair mel mac looks incredible
the mutant mayhem version of  her  doesn t look too bad  but at the same time i don t want  her  as april
does april need to be attractive in a childrens film of teenage mutant ninja turtles
i agree with everything you said and i am so glad it wasn t just me who thought that. btw i love your hair it s very cute
forget race swap....thats a completely different character. go to a comicon and show people that picture. theres no way anyone would say oh thats april from tmnt.
i like your sarcasm
not to be a conspiracy theorist but this could be some kind of purposeful change of characters in order to either erase the past or to attempt to warp some social narrative. i dunno. the wokies are literally going after everything. like a shotgun attack.
i think the racist card was used to focus criticism on a topic they know.  i personally don t care much about april s physique  but i dislike the overall art direction they took on the whole movie.  also looks like they change either the sex or sexuality of some turtles and with that i have a problem.like many botched projects before it  no plan to waste money on this crap.  my wallet has spoken.
i are unique  respeck mah pronouns....reee  i need to see me represented on screen  for everyone must look like the same grey glob of fiction reeeee
april o neal   more like april oh-no
people today don t want to see a high standard that they should rise to meet. rather than improve themselves  they would rather seek pity for themselves and bring standards lower so they can feel equally mediocre with everyone around them. no more striving for excellence  instead settle for mediocrity.
she s pretty hilarious ima sub
ok is it bad or no    we seen the ninja turtles as kids multiple times
@snow dude  not being hooked on cell phones.
the fact that she s a kid makes this sort of cringey.
the problem is that it is not an inclusion but an imposition  why can t they just respect the creator s work  and for those who say that april was black in the comics  they are wrong  at first it was thought that she would be asian  but she ended up being mestiza  to finally be redheaded and caucasian as the final and official design  all of us who were children remember turtles ninja for the 90 s series  not for reading a fucking comic  i was eager to see this movie  but that design made me vomit  i guess the 1990 movie will still be the best and only ninja turtle
i stood with joe when he left the girl-hungry producers of channel awesome. i stood with joe when he was accused of sexual assault. he is blatantly in the wrong here. i hope cooler minds prevail  as i don t want him to die on this hill  or to be sacrificed on the alter of woke. i think you should apologise joe  before you regret!
4 27 it s biology  but you know some guys like  big buts  and some guys no. it s some universal body shape everybody thinks is attractive but is different in a  big  healthy body and unhealthy fat.  and if girl has style and be nice person she will be fat or skinny can make an electrifying entry.  sometimes i think it s to much person with complex or self-esteem or maybe they did not grow up and think like primary school children.
cute  like a pug  or a turtle  i guess.april was black before and was still cute.but to be fair  they made everyone a bit weird and seem to be going with the ugly phase teenager for the turtles. it could be the same with april  but i think this depiction of april might be someone s self-insert  an adult lady with an unfortunate bone structure.but now it makes sense that the turtles would find her attractive.
she looks like a more hipster version of the new velma series
in my opinion rotmnt april is the best version of her. sure she was race changed but she was squite useful and had a fun personality. also her race had nothing to do with her character which was a bonus way better than the 2012 april o neil.
i want to sincerely apologize to michael bay  haim saban  and the people who wrote tmnt 3.while those incarnations of the turtles were terrible  they were nowhere near as low as what seth rogen churned out.also  whoever made the coming out of the shells tour deserves an apology as well.
how is master splinter going to teach this potato martial arts
i m black and i can t tell you how sick and tired i am of them race swapping characters in when they could literally just make original characters black that we can all be fans of too. it s like we re not worth the effort. it s lazy and turning april into a token trope.
does anyone appreciate the irony of her wearing skinny jeans
i see this april  i see the modern-day whoopi goldberg lmfao
well... i have high hopes for this april! i loved the rise of tmnt april and i m glad they re continuing in that way! also i think that judging the character based of 2 frames is a bit extreme  so let s not do that... really excited for the movie  d
you did grow up to be as beautiful as april o neal just an fyi.
i think people have grown to hate the beautiful woman and think of her as the enemy of the real woman. excuse me  but i m real and i identify as a beautiful woman. hating on pretty people is a form of body shaming.
bless
that is supposed to be april !
if this is april how would her friend irma would look like  well  they ll say they need ugly representation too
i thought they made her a turtle as well... lol
my problem isn t the race-swap  it s why does this april have to look so... frumpy  like a cross between the mother character from disney s strange world and mindy kaling s velma.i really don t like being reminded of  strange world  or  velma  in general  thanks. why would they do this to a big fan-favourite and a staple to a big multimedia franchise like april o nei- oh wait  i think i know the answer.   one point about  rise of the tmnt  version of april though  her design would have been adorable all round if it wasn t for the weird  pointy red-rimmed glasses. i m pretty sure they were supposed to echo the turtles  masks  but they really dragged her whole look down imo.
in the 90 s teenage mutant ninja turtles cartoon april o neal was shaped like a coca cola bottle. this april o neal is shaped like ..an egg. i actually don t even care about the race swapping  but they could ve made her at the very least fit and athletic. unless the character is now a shot putter  she ain t an athlete.
bay turtlers weren t terrible they all felt like their characters you just don t like the designs that doesn t make the characters terrible
if she was an original character they d still hate her.
looool for real  most unflattering outfit for her body type to boot
i agree! i think her design looks fine.
facts i m really fucking with it so far.
finally someone with the same opinion as me  jesus christ people need to stop complaining about race swaps
they would make irma look beautiful
@cj gamer  i really need to see their take on her
yea i was with you till the glasses
dude for real the glasses in rise are so ugly
what s next  they make her out performing the turtles once everyone starts throwing hands moving like super human athletes and fighters
thanks for this. subbed!!
i love the 1990s turtles movie  such a truthful adaptation of the original  more darker comics. it just went downhill since then. with this one right here  the turtles hit rock bottom.
some self-insert from one of the writers i bet.
i m black and tired of this woke stuff.    why they change her race and why doesn t like womanly or sexy like
best black april o neal is the rise of the tmnt she cracks me up  this one makes me crack open the fridge
if they completely change princess peach and amy rose  then i m tuning myself out.i can t control it  but i never asked for my childhood to be rewritten
wtf... why did they give her the danny devito s penguin body
what gets me is that she looks nothing like the comics. they aren t even trying to honor the source material. i don t care how much tmnt has evolved  she should always at least have a semblance of connection to what came first.
now april is 5th turtle!
as for the thumbnail  all i m saying is  considering the raceswap  tread carefully.
i understand that people have their opinions that don t matter at all. then there are places that people just need a community to vent with. this is that place. lol.
not true  we got tmmt rise  too bad it got hate for being different
this could ve easily been a new character...
it s ghostbusters 2016 all over again.
i ve been watching more of your videos lately  i think your pretty and very intelligent.
11 00 - when skynet comes on line  it s gonna remember that you said this...
i dont get you guys  racism and fat shaming. she is gorgeous  stunning even  her race and body type are beautiful. i wish you all well in the real world  april wasn t made to look unattractive. she just looks different.  also everybody complaining is either white  skinny  or ugly.
okay i get people getting made about changing an appearance of a character  but not liking her because she not attractive anymore shows that you don t even care about the character s personality or anything if the reason you don t like her is because all the sudden she doesn t look  hot  anymore. also how are people ignoring the fact that shes a literal child in this movie.  the whole point of april is that she s hot.  someone said. my thing is why are u saying this child should be hot. in 2012  2018  and this movie she is in her teens. i more worried about the fact that people want her to be hot so they can creep on a child.
i wish she looked closer to what melanie depicted on twitter as that depiction is quite cute though i d rather have an red head april just to subvert hollywood s gingercide but if they feel that they have to change her race for whatever fucking reason  i d rather have what melanie suggested than what seth  weed  rogen gave us
13 03 seth rogan must ve gotten permission from mindy to use a similar look...
because  unfortunately  the pandering has worked for long enough that they re not going to switch it up anytime soon no matter how much people protest. disney s been tanking but they insist on pushing out woke programming and films. i m just sad that tmnt  such an original and insane concept  is falling into this pattern.
you ve seen all of 5 seconds of the character in a trailer. chill out
@ben wetzel  shortie built like the 5th ninja turtle
@the midwest request  and  i m just kind of confused why it s so important that the character be thin or something. i don t particularly care one way or the other  but why is it so important that the characters body shape or proportions remain the same among all iterations
@ben wetzel  the michael bay movies failed because the turtles were 9ft tall and bullet proof its a simple formula but they always want to mess with the formula that leans on ascetics. april has always been an active go getter and a fighter this ain t it
@the midwest request  ok  i understand why it s important for the turtles to look like turtles. but april s a human  so the baseline should be that she s a human. also  a fighter  didn t she get kidnapped like all the time.
@ben wetzel fair enough  the 87 versions  including the video games  had her helpless at times. but that does not account for casey jones or karai  who became the female shreder. master splinter has taught april martial arts in several versions. in the last ronin  her daughter becomes the master to a new set of mutated turtles after michelangelo s passing.
wait  what are you talking about you mean sonic movie 3 and the mario movie
@snow dude  hahaha!  it hasn t been done yet  but i don t want to give them ideas!
it is a new character. none of the aprils in previous shows have been the same at all so why should this one be  if you re a tmnt fan you d know that every iteration is different but you choose to focus on this iteration simply because she looks different  that s ludacris and you look goofy.
@tessodan  oh damn  you heard it here first. if you re a tmnt fan you shouldn t be complaining and have no right to an opinion. kevin smith is that you   if you don t like it kids  don t watch.
@wheelgun wally  that s exactly what i m saying i m glad you agree with me brother
how so
i like this outfit  keep it up!
some people would say you re ugly it s all a matter of preference
isn t she like 12 in this why y all bitching
the first time they race swapped april a few years ago  they did make her cute to some degree  but this time around they just cranked up the morbidly obese to 11 dxi guess we gave them an inch a few years ago  and they took a mile by making her vastly unappealing dx
can someone please explain to me why 33 years and who knows how many advances in technology later  the turtles look far worse here than they did in the original film
yeah exactly atleast make her look good
melonie  two things here  you are right   you are  stunningly beautiful   this is a terrible look  and honestly  even if she looked great the whole trailer looks ugly and horrible to me. keep up the good work young lady!
this is diabetes!!
the question is  does it really matter  just let the artists do whatever they want. unlike velma  or little mermaid. you don t see the creators baiting the audience  or accusing them for being racist.this version is treated like they are going for an intentional vibe.most of all we shouldn t really call it bad  when she hasn t done or said anything yet. we really don t know enough  and it still has potential to be fun and enjoyable.
the fact that people actually defend this new design is just reeks of pure denial. these  people genuinely can t differentiate between being hot and being sexualised.
as part of the male community she s in the bottom tier of the cartoon females list.
the turtles would always try and hit on her!
guess there will be fewer pro-fat round people ignoring the health risk of being chubby will lead to a shorter time here. i wonder when that fact will finally register in their mind
bigger question  why would you hire seth rogan  santa inc   for this
based
it is just reaching at this point. not even understanding how she is contradicting herself too many times
rise of fake velma
maybe it s nothing  although if the goal was to make april as unattractive as possible  what intentions were meant by the inclusion of race-swapping. from a writer s standpoint  that s one trait i d have purposefully steered clear of
i m so glad that i stopped bothering to watch all of these remakes  reimaginings   reboots. they never do anything but make it a production in travesty. entertainment is supposed to be an escape  for a moment  of our reality. i have yet to see a reimagining   remake   reboot of any of my childhood movies or shows or video games that could even hold a candle to the originals for even one second. i m just going to stick to watching my favorite youtube creators playing video games.... because modern entertainment right now just ain t it.
i think the outsourced animators simply got the instructions wrong.  they thought they were supposed to draw a black rosie o donnell.
the only person i have come across who is attracted to fat women is captain spaulding  from the rob zombie movies  house of 1000 corpses    the devil s rejects  and  3 from hell  .and he is a fictional character.
erma s supposed to be the one who is more nerdy less attractive  not april.
bruh it s a kids show nobody cares
@jaden_hatedbymost  seems like you care
@jackdmanheim  u mad dat a kid character not sexy get a girlfriend
@jaden_hatedbymost  lol  seems like you care a lot
deeper the cushion  the better the pushin !  then  in the next movie  we saw that in action.
one of my best friends was a chubby chaser. he died. he was crushed under a fatty. just kidding. brain aneurysm.
tell me you racist without you telling me you racist  y all so weird  genuinely get a life to live lol
isn t april supposed to be able to fight and in general be athletic  i m not seeing those characteristics in this new april. it s not about race  body types or beauty standards or whatever. it s about it not being april o neil. i ll never understand why these creators can t just make a whole new ip... oh wait  money  agendas and the like.
i d go a step further  yes she s ugly now  but she s also been tokenised. it s that old thing  they don t want to create new black characters and put the same amount of effort into building them up. but they still want the virtue points from having black characters so they just race swap white characters. it s actually racist that they use certain races like trophies to hold up and make themselves look good.and for some reason it seems to disproportionately happen to redheads lol.
so did seth rogen approach mindy kalinga about using her  not velma  design  or did kaling threaten to  off his if he didn t use it
so they can change race and body build of a character  yet that s not supposed to change the character s personality. it s supposed to somehow be the same character... sure  right.
bring back the fit redhead april theirs still time to edit the movie.
first
7 18 look at the history of art. ancient civilizationsand the canon of beautiful  three graces  pompeian fresco  late medieval - renesans sandro botticelli spring and three graces of peter rubens and last one is first artist  probably not  ho likes  big buts     antonio canova in three graces likes something different
april was my secret childhood love.
april looks like a 70 year old grandma who is collecting disability insurance.
ellie from borderland 2 portrays a bigger characteri a lot better.
holy hell  they turned april into a garbage pail kid.
i m holding out on  whether or not  this movie will be good not just on april s looks. who knows  if they make a sequel  maybe they ll make her lose weight
they needed a built in  you re all just a bunch of bigots  defense for when  not if  when this fails.
btw  what makes me feel bad steven universe is that they knew how to make beautiful women beautiful. so it s not the style. some people just draw ugly art.
these eyes of mine don t see race only thiccness.mangekyou thiccugan!!!i think people would have had a less problems with an attractive black womanthey probably still wouldn t have liked the changes but they would have been like if she is still cute.
you could keep everything about her new desing but make her white and it would still be the worst desing april has ever have.
she is mutant in this new cartoon  you just do not get it  d
i agree with basically everything you say with regards to woke hollywood so i watch your channel. but the fact that you re objectively attractive doesn t hurt either. that s just how life works.
they should ve taken inspiration from the gritty original mirage turtles and shown a cool more hardcore version of the turtles instead of another goofy cartoon kids version
it doesn t look good on any level. lol
animation looks fine but given the nature the change one small the rest of the things will be changed then it s not ninja turtles
yup!
all i just say to seth rogan is good luck. seeing how he massacred her says it all
i just wanted a 90 s cartoon version of tmnt. a white redhead in yellow clothes was a part of that version.
anyone who is still woke by now will probably never change. my boss is woke and i have to keep politics out of our conversations because it gets maddening. goes to show you just how powerful the elites can be with their propaganda.
still love you mel  stay gorgeous babe...
not watched the video just thought the title was funny  i don t think anyone should care about the race of the character bcs it s a completely different universe  i just agree that she was done dirty  ik she s a kid but damn
my problem is that people are mad that a character is fat and not just because her design is bad.  they think that her being fat was the team trying to normalize it when i think it was nothing more than bad character design.more over for you to just say that she was made ugly on purpose is wild.no reason to believe that.with no idea of who the team is and what they ve worked on. invincible and the boys .and let me get this straight.the last black design is a bad steven universe chibi artstyle tha steven universe started pushing... waht  you couldn t even say that with a straight face. you cant even put them next to eachother.whats also weird is that people think this is woke agenda. but  why  april was never concistent. some of the past designs don t even look like april. and april has even been black before. but this time it s considered woke.somebody please help me understand.
she have dwarfism dude  that s all. the last time i watched tmt was around 2009 or something. when she was a little girl. but most people remembered the 80 s cartoon version of her.
realistically they push the woke crap  but the majority of people like what they like  and pushing the narrative to change characters is just going to have more people not watch  play  or read their crap.
megan fox raised the bar for april o neil s appearance. there is no going back.
this is diabetes  cracked me up. this movie just looks so terrible. i want a good tmnt movie with a darker story line made for teenagers adults. if someone could somehow pull that off i guarantee it would make huge bucks at the box office. but i continue to dream. nice hair btw.
first velmanow april o neil
if the turtles saw the new version of april o neil  imagine their reaction  oofa! what happened to her!
i can put up with the tmnt franchise being about teenage mutant turtles named after renaissance painters who were trained by a rat in the sewers to become ninjas and have them fight interdimensional aliens  but the moment they give april a weird haircut the moment the franchise becomes too ridiculous and nonsensical!!!for shame seth rogen  shame on him on ruining the sanctity of the tmnt franchise! this will cause the next great plauge and plunge the world into endless wars!  giveaprillonghair
this character looks somebody from saints row 2022 thinking she is some sort of gangster.  when she is not
that s it  hollywood ain t getting a dime from me again. long live the non-paid free streaming sites.
i should go watch the old turtles.
we have a responsibility. if we predict characters like this  then we are saying fat is okay  which is what the woke want. however the truth is it s unhealthy and we are telling kids that is alright to be fat and unhealthy.  it s a crazy world we live in nowadays.
you want a worst movie this is the one.2014-2016 live action 5 stars rating punch me in the gut for this the movie is good man.. you will see mikey raph leo don those are cool dudes the real movie changer! change my mind.
to be fair  she is  cute . there s different kinds of  cute . puppies and kittens are cute.  cute  often refers to  small   which must be why  cute girl  is a thing  but not  cute woman . a bulldog puppy  drooling and slobbering and panting uncontrollably is  cute .
she looks like mindy kailing
so having a irish last name in america and be black is not uncommon especially since i am black with an irish last name. this is why we need proper history being taught in schools. all of that being said  i don t like this april either. i love that old look and i hate the way ninja turtles have look in the 2010s as well. nothing wrong with disliking a look. fat and black with all previous ones looking fit. fat is not healthy. the next move will have april oneal as a black transgender woman. not ok
oh my god.april got mutated.
i love how we should make female characters obese and ugly so fat girls shouldn t be made feel insecure about their own bodies  yet when i was growing up we were told we should look like arnold schwarzenegger or jean claude van damme. have you seen either of them in their prime and youth  arnold had bigger pecs then some guy s butt  and jcvd was ridiculously shredded and fit. how on earth was any boy suppose to keep up with let s say jcvd from his kickboxer body  it s very difficult to get body like that even now  30  years later because it requires very strict diet  habit and discipline and doing gym 24 7.
i want to see mlk movie where leonardo dicaprio plays mlk. just for the comments  d
to be fair tnmt died when they did the  brah turtles  remake as opposed to the  cowabunga dudes turtles . no surprised they screwed with april and her back story. these people must hate money because i doubt anyone buys that trash.  isn t it weird that some racial narratives accuse another one for  cultural appropriation  yet now it is allowed without questions  hmmm
i never got to see april in the trailer because as soon as the  from seth rogan  title card appeared i d click to skip the ad it s fascinating watching people seeing black characters being portrayed as absolute dump trucks over   over again and trying to gaslight it by going  ah yes  how normal  i don t recall them championing the initial character design from the first sonic trailer like they have with these  reinterpretations  of april  velma  ariel etchmmm
why is she as wide as she is tall !
they clearly took some inspiration from velma
it s almost like ppl on twitter don t have eyes. yes beauty is subjective  yes this is a cartoon... but there was a standard with this damn near forty year old franchise. if they don t care to honor what came before  i feel it the duty of us ogs to call out they bs of hollywood entertainment.
that troll never would have been hired as a tv news reporter.
won t see that movie for sure because 1-april being an ape roll for lack of better terms...  notmyapriloneil2-john cena. enough said.3-teenage mutant ninja turtles not really feeling like said teenagers. more like 10 year olds. at best  maybe pre-teens but otherwise...also  is it me or has april gotten younger throughout each tmnt iterations oh  and 4-seeing how tmnt has been remade to appeal only the ufama mob doesn t help its case.
i have no issue with the race-swapped april. remember baxter stockman was originally black but made white in the for the 80 s cartoon.
in the 2012 version  she is actually part mutant
oh yay  another race swap...  i m a hard pass.
what angers me isn t the fact she s swapped at all  but the reason behind it. in my opinion race swapping is disingenuous and to me proof they don t have the creativity to just create a new character of color and  just paint an existing character instead.
april now looks like a kappa  a water spirit from japanese folklore. splinter is from japan  so maybe there is a connec  nahhh this design is horrendous and what s worse is that they think they are doing social justice with this. gooooosh!
hey melonie  i ve started doing the carnivore diet again! any food meal ideas to help keep me in ketosis  it s only been a week but i feel good!
and what makes it even funnier is they keep harping on the  she s 12  argument...what 12 year old is working as a reporter  lol
inclusivity points. the esrg rating system rates companies on how inclusive they are including sex  race  body positivity etc. companies get more sponsors  investors  bonuses etc the more woke they are.plus commiefornia is now pushing a bill to tax companies less if they tick off enough woke boxes. companies are now incentivised forced to comply with wokeness to save their own skin.
i d like to see a little more  before passing sentence.the preliminary 2003 series designs of the leads  looked a lot boxier and more angular  than the finished versions turned out in motion.  let s wait and see the finished product  and not obsess over the first official trailer.  if the first impressions don t pan out  we won t have stressed out over a nothingburger.  but if they do  then there will be that much more ammunition.  and this is a franchise that has historically redesigned just about every character at some point or other  and not always to universal acclaim.  so...not completely unprecedented  sadly.and spare me the  get woke go broke  business.  this franchise has historically been well left of the middle   cough  sons of the silent age cough 1492  cough    and it even got a book length satanic panic treatment by joan hake robie in 1992.  i submit that it s not exactly  getting  woke  if it s been there the whole time.just my 2 .
honestly the turtle designs are terrible as well.i prefer the consistent designs they all had from the 1987 movie and 2003 show.the turtles have the colored masks as their defining physical trait the rest should be defined by their personality and actions.
i haven t used my twitter account for over a year due to all of the toxicity and the riffraff on the site! even though elon bought the site months  i m still returning to the twitterverse any time soon.
yay keep it up! just stick to meat  eggs  and some dairy if you tolerate it and you should stay in ketosis no problem
you re beautiful and cool. the world could use more females like yourself. i hope you live to be way over hundred years old.
i am glad that this is being pointed out by you and other youtubers. i grew up with ninja turtles and i m not going to watch this new crap. its always about replacing our beloved characters with racially altered characters. why  its no different from changing a beloved black character to white. the fans not having it!
the original april o neal is based off of eastman s then girlfriend  april fletcher. she was mixed race. i m not mad that they changed her as much as i m annoyed that the turtles sound like children and they all seem to have the same gen z moron personality. this version however looks more like irma to me...
i grew to like and enjoy rises april. but this is where my attention of disbelief seems to end.
validating eating potato chips!
it s just another example of woke ideology trying to erase standards. there are objective beauty standards  but not everybody fits that mold. instead of being able to create a character that people look up to  admire  and want to be like  they create characters that are reflections of their woke demographics. that standard of beauty is too hard for them to achieve  and god forbid we actually work for something  so the standard gets lowered. if you challenge it or try to call for truth  they call you phobic.  you re being fat-phobic!  really  i said you probably shouldn t have that double quarter pounder and fries for the third time this week. lighten up  insert rimshot sound . being fat is unhealthy. take care of yourselves  stop giving us  fat icons  and telling us they re heroes for it  and please can we just have one ip that isn t trying to woke up their stuff that s all. cheers everybody! keep up the awesome content  melonie!
if race doesn t mean anything  why keep the turtles as turtles  i say we reimagine them as chickens.
you dont have to go see the damn movie
agreed  however  i would like to point out the a lot of red headed characters have been getting the race swap as of lately. i wonder why the representation of red headed irish characters is being oppressed lately. that s aside  i totally agree with you! hardly see irish women characters now.
i wonder what kasey looks like
it s really sad to someone who s loved the turtles since the beginning. isn t enough that star wars and marvel are dead
if i said you had a beautiful body would you hold it against me  if i swore you were an angel will you treat me like the devil tonight   - yes  feminists would treat you like you re evil if you admired beautiful women.
april oat-meal
only her name  rippa breaks it down really well. i ll be honest  i didn t know this was a thing and don t really care about it but his video appeared in my recommended feed so i gave it a watch.
i mean april o neal was already made black for one of best animated versions of the series
she do look crazy
i saw the trailer before this video and lost my ever loving mind. i am a big tent fan. still have all my original figured and they crapped all over my childhood.  april is the first and obvious problem  then you have jackie chan who is chinese play a japanese character.  then you have the turtles themselves more of preteen than actual teenagers  then you have the absence of krang  shredder and the foot clan  then the voice over options are awful you have 2 women playing tough villain characters like leather head and ray filet  then your villain choices are all characters that didn t have a big story to begin with and where toward the end cycle of the franchise.  this is just a bunch of woke leftists modernizing something to fit their narrative when it was already good to begin with and now it s utter trash. this is outrageous and in the words of michaelangelo  total bummer dude!
seth rogen  thread it s also strange that the changes in characters always have a similar theme  hmmmmm. is this beneficial to progression  why never hispanic  i guess they re going for  buzzfeed facebook blogger  instead of attractive report people tune in to see.
but seriously how did she go from ginger pale white to black with dreds    wtf !
a few points i want to make  1. seth rogen does not know  nor does he care what the first t in tmnt stands for.2. those designs make for middle schoolers at best  10-11 years old   they are nowhere near teenagers  16-17 years old .3. making april o neil morbidly obese just goes to show you that he hates her  and us  but that was made very clear from a long time ago .4. he used this ip to promote his agenda.5. the art style and concept of tmnt are more hideous as the years pass by  and why do they went and have raph missing some teeth or don with eye glasses is beyond me .6. having april being morbidly obese could actually work in her favor  as fat women are harder to kidnap. 7. this project is doa  like santa inc and like all the other alphabet mafia projects.8. april was designed by mindy kaling !9. nichelodeon has restricted comment  so i guess we won !
tries to enter sewer gets stuck
she wasn t originally a redhead lol
no
@kuggacourage gx  it s quoted from an old song by the bellamy brothers
krang is actually in the movie but is played by a woman.
@the swoly ghost  o jeeze. that s awful
as james rolfe has said of another ruined reboot  i am going to just opt out and not watch it.
i bet 95  of angry authors have no clue that april was originally afroamerican  at least mixed race xd talk about the race-switch. you are hilarous.
damn all facts here
she looks more like irma like really if you want to do irma  just do irma.
i do still want to ask though  is she really supposed to be beautiful  . i mean obviously she s been conventionally hot  beautiful and or cute in every incarnation of the turtles before  i agree. but how important is that trait to her personally  when maybe a 1 3rd of the time she s treated like a warrior hero herself  and 1 3rd she s the nerd in the chair trope  and 1 3rd she s a daring news reporter  being hot compliments 2 of those and is just okay with the other. and being hot usually is important when the characters are going to get hot with each other on screen because it s hard to enjoy vicariously watching ugly people make out. but if i ever see them make april and michaelangelo make out on screen i might wake up screaming every night until i die. so april doesn t need to be hot for that ever.and as a kind of audience point of view character who brings you in to discovering the abnormal world of the turtles  maybe being a plain jane could work well with her. maybe. if this isn t a version that plans to make her an action hero sidekick too.don t get me wrong though   i m still 100  with you on not liking this new design. you re right hollywood is trying to hard to glorify ugliness and poor health  and i d much rather april look attractive whether she s a ninja warrior or the hacker nerd in a chair.
i think this is kind of missinng the point. they changed the turtles drastically too. in the original comic run and the original cartoons the turtles seemed like they were immature and 25  and they are actually teenagers now. in the most recent movies they were like 7 and a half foot tall behemoths. they want to make the character designs more inclusive  and that s ok. at the end of the day it s a movie for children  and they want to give role models for more kids. anyone can look up to the turtles because they are green and not human  but april is inhuman because she s traditionally built impossibly. it s a children s movie  she doesn t need to be hot  they can just make her cool instead  and girls that look like her can have a cool character to look up to who fights crime with ninjas. i get the nostalgia and wanting characters to look like how you remember  but giving role models to kids who have less of them is not really a problem i think. i think you re overreacting but i also think the people getting extremely mad at you are kind of overreacting. also i get why people would call you racist if you specifically don t like the poc designs  but i guess i understand not liking the artstyle too much
lol why does the left hate gingers  april o neil isn t exactly like spiderman where  anyone can be spiderman  she s been basically the same all the way through. if something ain t broke...........
where comics and cartoons used to have idealized  fit and hot  characters  that is now offensive. why is that  because there s a segment of the population who has grown up on said media  but never left their basement room  and not can handle deal with the real world...or something like that. i grew watching he-man  but it s perfectly normal that the real world isn t sci-fi fantasy buff dudes and fit babes.  the us culture war is the end of as the country eats its own  destryed from the inside.
yup  they are uglifying her. yes  i always thought april o neil was a babe back in the day but this is potato o niel.
at this point  i m convinced hollywood and liberals just hate the scottish and irish. it s always the ginger
well serious question how would you do the tmnt
no  i think this is awesome. she clearly drank the mutagen and is part turtle.
@mike c  i didn t say she had to be. let me put my case this way for you.fictional characters need to be hot for 1 of 4 reasons. 1  they are supposed to have job that favors hot people. 2  the are extremely charismatic and popular in a way that s more believable if there hot3  the are a god godess action hero you want to fantasy live vicariously through.4  they are the romantic object of sexual desire of protagonist you do fantasy vicariously live through. of those 4  only some of them apply to april some of the time  but not every version.jessica rabbit by the way must be hot because reason number 4. and laura croft makes sex moans when climbing over ledges....she s hot for reason number 4. and 3 cause she s an action hero.
@mike c lara does sometimes look like shes meant to be a playboy bunny rather than a explorer.i mean i am just not lying her design is almost on par with the weird hyper sexualized fake big boobed women npcs of hitman blood money which were honestly hilarious to see in every level.
@wesleyan wannabe you forgot number 5  they hired a hot big star actress to get those seats filled with women who admire them  lesbians who are into them  men who like them   find them hot.one of the worse reasons to ever be casted i feel.
@chandller burse  that certainly a huge selling pro of attractive actresses. but i couldn t build a case a fictional character is supposed to be hot for that reason. it just means it s great if they are. a good extra plus for being hot  but not a minus if they were cast to not be hot.in the 4 cases i listed  it would be detrimental to the character if they were not hot.
@wesleyan wannabe  being casted simply for looks than acting is also bad though.
@chandller burse  i think you re misreading my case if your saying  also  and  bad .i m not saying any of these 4 reasons is bad. they are practical  wise  artistically sound and good.and casting a hot actor just to sell tickets is also good. lots of  people work hard on movies and anything simple to get butts in seats to give the film a try is worth it so everyone s hard work pays off. and people work hard for there money that they spend on movies. they don t owe your movie a ticket purchase just to boost the ego of every fat lesbian girl who identifies with the ugly lead actress. we spend our hard earn dollars on movies that appeal to us in some way and sometimes megan fox in very short pants is plenty of stand alone appeal to earn that from me.
at this point it s just fun to watch how badly they mangle these properties  and it s seth rogan  his last animated show was a santa s elves show that spent the entire time talking shit about christianity and was an excuse to air female corporate employee grievances  damn so awesome i can t wait to pay to see what propaganda he cooks up for tmnt and the gross  dysgenic character designs they force us to stomach
what in the unholy hell lol how did she go from a slim  beautiful bombshell of a redhead to that
i think this is being done for a few reasons. for one  seth rogan took the blue pill. for two  hollywood hates the idea of the male gaze. three  hollywood hates gingers. four  hollywood hates white people now.chances are  she s probably going to be lgbt   and will likely also have something other than a christian religious view. hollywood always wants to check as many boxes as they can in the name of diversity - not out of any artistic merit  but because it fits  the message .i hope this movie flops as hard as santa inc.
is that velma in tmnt lol
i watch moistcritical dmc 5 review...... for some reason moistcritical hate nico character......
i feel like it has to be an insult to young girls of color  saying that women of color can only be race swapped from caucasian characters  rather than being new and original characters of equal value.  they should never have used april in the first place  it should have been a new character.
there also trying to pull the  april was originally black in the comics!  too  but this is actually false she was originally intended to be black  but when she made her debut the idea was changed. maybe its getting too technical  but i just find it dishonest of them saying that without any context.
i hate we live in a world where people are so sensitive that criticism by calling a character design ugly  which it is  gets turned into you being called a bigot for having an opinion
she was supposed to be black and she s black where s the problem
@jin2k  it s just the way it s said  saying  april was originally black in the comics  implies that she was first black when debuted but changed afterwards  but the way you said it made it clear that she was originally supposed to be black but didn t happen  but now she is  as far as the color of the skin goes it doesn t matter. however how people word things  sometimes being purposely deceitful matters.
she was made white for the toys  and then it stuck.
i think she s erma not april. she looks nerdy and have slightly same hair style like erma also she wore glasses.
i already didn t like this for being another goofy kid cartoon when i want something similar to the original movie  but i think april just needs to stay the hot white ginger girl. this is just ridiculous.
maybe it s me  but if a character is named  april o neil  she probably is of irish ancestry. i guess it is cool to pretend irish people don t exist now. only black and brown culture matters
crazy to think michael bay did a better job. dude actually care for his fans   casted fricking megan fox as april. dang. the new one is a steep downgrade lol
as a fan of literally everything in this series  totally excluding aprili do not give a fuck about what she looks like as long as she s a journalist in some way or another  also it s modern animation  leave women looking like bombshells to 80s cartoons
i genuinely thought that was  velma
oh i m glad that for once its not just race change but they included weight too. cool! if you re gonna race change then include body image too and so they did. they were one step ahead of disney  who only race changes. so you know what  kudos to the new look. i wont watch this show though because the voices of the turtles are awful  cant take them seriously.and no  its shocking when a series like elite has no chubby characters and only attractive characters  it makes a show shallow and far more....also sounds like  your point of view of attarctive is  not  chubby or fat. lmao... your comparison of woman that doesn t fit beauty standards but is attractive is skinny... lmao. surprise  characters can be chubby or curvy and don t need to be thin to be beautiful or fit the beauty factor.
honestly  each iteration of the turtles is unique in its own way  i don t see why it matters that april is attractive or not  there s no need to push this agenda that characters have to be this static  never-changing spitting image of the original design. if i were to summarize the point of this video  it s that april is meant to be skinny and desirable  and beauty standards are supposed to be limited to only what s conventionally attractive.to each their own  but beauty can be found in other ways than what s conventional
i don t really get why she has to be hot. i don t find her objectively attractive but why does she have to be   like a character can be ugly and still have personality and character   someone please explain why this is a big deal. honestly tell me why she has to be conventionally attractive other than just because she used to be or has been in the past. the turtles used to be super buff but you don t see anyone complaining that they don t have huge muscles anymore
what i don t understand is why people feel the need to change existing and established characters  at all   why not make up your own new heroes that look how you want them to look  and act how you think they should act   surely if your ideas are superior to the horrible racists and bigots of the past  those new heroes will become more popular than the old ones  right
wasn t enough in the budget
that april is clearly a grill  not a woman. it ll be cool if she grows into a taller gal as the seasons go on.
i m gonna get shit for saying this  but i m indifferent to the raceswap. i personally don t think it s that bad. it looks like a different interpretation  and i think the character seems  for the most part  to be intact. again my opinion on how it seems. ik people will be mad over the raceswap  and how she looks clapt  i agree she doesn t look attractive . however  it doesn t bother me too much as it seems this version of april is a child  from what i m seeing and not a full blown woman. so yh i m not too mad at it. if the movie comes out and it s filled to the brim with identity politics and wokeness  and they actually use the race of april here as a crutch...then it s a problem. for now...i don t have many concerns.edit  i do agree she should be pretty though. i really wish was a lot better in looks.
thanks for using the word ugly cuz i thought of it but didn t wanna say it
unpopular opinion but i do like what they are doing with the turtles. it should be fun to watch. it s kind of exciting. i like the art style and i mean as far as april i think she is age appropriate for the turtles in this rendition. they are  prepubescent  aged turtles so i mean having an overly sexualized woman hanging around them would kind of be weird. i mean as far as having a cute girl as april really isn t that big of a deal. these turtles are 12-14 years old. not the 17-19 year olds that we have come to know. so honestly i think she s fitting for this series and style of turtles. please be gentle in the comments lol. this is just my opinion. lol
she looks like my mom lmao
ngl  i may agree that drop dead black chucks exist.but  i do get tired as fuck of race and gender swap bs  to appease the woke crowds...that or changing their sexuality.whatever the original released version on these topics for these exact subjects is what i prefer most of the time.kinda like how some gay writer had luke skywalker make a thought or something that another male character was attractive.i am straight and think it is ok to compliment another dude.but  i don t want or need luke to be gay cause  it s the cool thing today. it would be like if someone got the rights to hp and made dumbledore straight.i see thus with almost any property.i do not care for shitty swpas purely to appeal to audiences.i just wish it would stop happening.and yes  i have plenty of times i wish x character was like x tyoe of thing  cause i would like it like what i want.but  i understand the importance of keeping certain things like they are  sometime tradition is not bad.but whatever.the world will do whatever as it does  i can only hope that one day things will go back to what make sense to someone like myself.
her character fits the style of the artist illustration. when you admit in the beginning of your video that some people may be attracted to this type of woman and see her as  cute   what s the problem  if  some people will find her attractive.   they wouldn t change a thing about the character. but  you on the other hand labeled her character as  ugly . a mean  strange  spiteful  classless   reckless word. what would you  change  about  this  april  mind you this is the rendering of a working artist who was hand selected by nickelodeon to reinterpret a cartoon character that fits their famously valued perspective. seth rogan and crew are famously spot on when it comes to hitting the demographics and target audiences. what would make her character more of a  babe  to you  a weird term like  ugly   takes away from your opinion you posted here on youtube. this is obviously more than  removing the teeth from sonic the hedgehog  for you and what you prefer to check off as  pretty . what is your modern take on what a  pretty woman  should be in a movie that focuses on ooze  turtles  martial arts and mutants  don t forget to incorporate the times we live in  cinematic history  millennials feelings  relatability to children teens   every  shame culture  out there. should we drop her about 80 pounds  filter in a coke bottle shape  add yellow leggings  a little blush or freckles   a few lines that make her strictly about her career goals and how much she has to fight for equality while mutants  criminals and her camera man make unwanted advances towards her... because tmnt fans carve that amazing dialogue   what s a pretty little thing like you  doing in a dark ally   her blouse gets ripped  her heels break  then she s saved by teenagers  mutants  who also must comment on her beauty to really tie the whole movie together. sound good
i agree. she shouldn t look like whoopy goldberg  she should look like kelly roland.
i m going to have to respectively disagree on this  while i m not gonna go out and say you re a terrible person  racist and all that- i really  personally  do not see what is so ugly about her  yes  the design is different  and does not fit conventional beauty standards. but i m going to say that it s fine. plenty of beautiful women exist in the world that don t fit the more  healthy  body shape  and i am going to say that skinny doesn t equal healthy  yadda yadda ik . and masculinity doesn t really   equal unattractiveness  like  sure there s the conventional beauty standard- but  honestly. i  personally  do not care that much- she s beautiful to plenty of people  not just  anomalies  as you put them. and- hot take  don t come at me for this  i think the new design fits with the style mutant mayhem established so far. none of the characters we ve seen in the trailer are supposed to be viewed as   hot   or really attractive  or fit the beauty standards  just look at the turtles themselves- they are the most  teenage  looking turtles we ve got! braces! tooth gaps! voice cracks!! and while i will say the movie  which isn t even out yet  and the designs aren t unable to be criticized  this isn t the way i d go about it.people find different body shapes attractive! you find the conventional beauty standard more attractive  i don t! and that s okay!! we all don t need to be at war with each other and calling so and so ugly! our opinions are different! and they don t need to be the same! we just don t need to argue about it- i saw the original tweet  and both sides were not handling it well. it was a war when it shouldn t have been!!
isn t this a movie
oh... not sure
i agree with everything you just said
@cj gamer  thanks
@bored panduh  you re welcome
plus this version of april is a child not a teenager or an adult
@cj gamer  exactly!!
she looks more like irma
black women are often relegated against beauty standards set for women of european descent. so when  conventional  standards are applied to black women  it often means they have to be thin  fair skinned  straighter hair  lighter eyes  etc. that s why someone like beyonce is catapulted and someone like serena williams  who s fine as hell by black standards  is deemed less attractive by white americans. hence  your masculine references echoes the sentiments.in your defense of conventional beauty standards  you don t reference the historical objectification and policing a black women s bodies. in your comparison of similar black depictions of april  you favored the images of her being thinner  having straighter hair and fairer skin. basically  while you re saying this isn t a race issue  you re demonstrating explicit anti-black biases. it s also very interesting that the summation of the april characters  depiction is relegated to her attractiveness and nothing about her intellect  attitude and investigative fortitude. and yes  we get it that you re against anything that doesn t center white heterosexual european christian men. the opposite of woke is being asleep.
this is the most revolting thing they could ve done to april. they made her fat and black...why
yay melonie !
i m not happy to be living in a society where the only woman allowed to happily have bazoombas in a coverall with sexy hair is a shop teacher that was a man a year ago.
can someone please tell me why they replace redheads every time i don t understand why it doesn t make sense to me
y all are wild. she s a teenager in this version. teenagers of all kinds are ugly. her job as a teenager in this movie isn t to look sexy or attractive. if she was an adult  it would be a different story because it would be for the sake of making her unattractive. but she s underage  y all need to relax.  she s supposed to be an adult   you do understand that prequels and coming of age stories exist right  y all are just nitpicking at this point  seriously. this is a non issue  without question. these are video games and animated movies. why are y all up in arms on the attractiveness of a drawing  they made her fat  so what  it doesn t matter. i m not watching turtles for a cartoon woman  i m watching turtles to watch the boys fuck shit up. we have real women for that. these things aren t real  they re fictional characters.
first of all. we ve seen like  maybe 3 seconds of her. all of which i felt accurately portrayed her as a journalist while interviewing the turtles. but because she s not pretty enough to your standards that s the issue  what does that even have to do with her character  because i didn t feel at all that her design was made to be this controversial or for woke sake. you guys that upset because of the way a 14 year old looks in a movie made for children from a different generation
yeah i find the new design ugly.  the rise of tmnt s april design was also black was cute though not my favorite design that will be the 2012 design.
it s pure wokeness. wokeness is their religion. and they are fanatics. relentless. they see it as their divine duty to rip everything apart and replace them with woke versions.
she s cute it s new velma!
wtf u mean
the beauty standards we grow up on in the past was for us. they are making new traditions for the younger people. yes april o neil looks unhealthy to us but the younger people do not care about that. let the youth enjoy their present day  beauty standards.
the april o neil from the original mirage run of tmnt was black and was a scientist assistant to baxter stockman. she was changed to a white reporter in the original tv show.this april is physically and mentally closer to the original than the one we ve gotten used to since the late 80s.
i am a black man and april is not black in the comics this was done purposely and they made her overweight on purpose. this stuff has to stop.
the turtles don t sound like teenagers... even though it s  teenage mutant ninja turtles . they sound like little kids...
omg...  what s the world turning into...
don t judge a book by it s cover i feel like that a lesson that you forgot. maybe what they want to focus on is persanilty than beauty
bpm   appeasement of the black audience. i m black but i ask why  we love the way april was.
it s made by seth rogen. expecting anything from him at all is already a mistake  even if what you expect is disappointment.
i say the same shit. i don t care if i m represented.  i just want a cool kick ass good looking character. or just not some bullshit  forced down my throat.
wtf woke have to do with this
wrong
nope.
@good times  yep
almost like teens have different voices including preteens
well...beauty is just being skinny. its she a teenager
we need to go back to old school 90 s artistic talents and
april oat meal........
sad april has a gunt
incredible 1 cut take mel
arpil o neil.her name is arpil
she is not a redhead bombshell. why  that is more a turtle look thing i never seem.
my april onleal is red haired and yellow jumpsuit in this we got her nerdy friend irma and april meshed together made her fat and black
you do realize that vast majority of african americans have european last names so her last name alone is not indicative of her culture alone.
yes  they wanted you to lie.
what a sad joke and they wonder why they lose money.....good job mel.
i bet you guys a million dollars   april is going to identify as gay   trans or has pronouns.......
i m not even going to reference the statement to which i m responding when i say   we ll have to agree to disagree .
the ugliness level is over 9 000!! lol
actually when did april turn black
there is a war against beauty
she looks like she has a lot of cats
hot girl  doesn t want to see  fat girl  on screen. message received.
you should play april.
there are so many things wrong with this video
as an example of chubby yet cute character is squirriel girl in new animated series. or mei from overwatch.  they trow away her femenine side and thats is part of the problem
anyone who says megan fox isn t hot  prior to all the new plastic surgery especially  are simply lying.
this april got hit with the ugly stick wait she got hit with the whole tree lol
i have to disagree  april is in shape ..a circle is a shape
she looks like a young female black version of seth rogen
the hatred for redheads and gingers must be stopped!
the reason they are doing it is so average girls don t feel bad .
they are doing the same thing they did with felma
what !!!! who said she was gorgeous  !! i should lend that person my glasses!!!
she certainly looks like she spends a lot of time in the sewer.
lol
watch roger scruton s  why beauty matters . i think his take explains why we see diversity side with the esthetically ugly.
who s voicing her  mindy kahling  casey found her hot  the turtles found her hot. eastman   laird invisible her hot.
gingercide be like
i think it s more of an over correction because in the original comics she was half black half white then got white washed in the 90s so now they are going the other direction
she looks like a cross between whoopi goldberg and joy behar.
amala from prager u she is really cute  sadly she is taken
im waiting for the asian casey jones swap or changing mikey to mikaela lmao
it s literally just a different version of tmmt like all the different versions of it
we need new stuff
another voided red head. not sure why red heads are being eliminatedfrom movies   why new character scould not be created and incorporated into the story april o neil has had 20 different versions of the character!!waiting for the april o neil multiverse crossover event.
ikr
and probably smells like the sewer as well.
april o neal was originally black in the comics they race swapped her for the original cartoon so propsto them
arpil o neal
ngl she looks like claudette from dead by daylight but a bit .bigger
the new april is full hairy   underneath  armpit
is it so hard to make different human characters   sure it s harder to make cool superhero characters but regular humans
this is taken waayyy out of hand for a cartoon character. beauty standard  there s gonna be plenty more april s after this one and in my own opinion  beauty is selective and everyone has their own view of what they consider beautiful. but hey  i ain t mad at ya for your take on it  but when it comes to artwork and character designs  like beauty  everyone has their own take and viewpoint. but again  this is just my thoughts. great video btw.
i m perfectly fine with her being black it s a little better in my opinion because she can have the black woman sass and charm but she could ve looked the same just black but people would have complained that they just color swapped you can t win!
april looks like she s one  and  fried   from being the most racially insensitive character on screen
what  which one  which one was april oneil  i can t tell the difference. i recently lost 80 percent of my vision watching something stupid.
maybe she got mutated
i don t think kasey jones wants her now
this show or movie or whatever is preatty much doa.
velma 2.0
she s a little girl  she s not going to look like a model.
whoa a not conventional beauty  the videogame character she looks normal
they race swap characters like this on purpose to use the race card as an excuse if it fails
she looks like whoopi... but why
looks like bebop and rocksteady had a baby!
what are you doing here velma in the future
thats just velma the new show
stop
it s a tribute to whoopie. go woke go broke
idk  not sure i care about this one  other than the mandatory race-swap which is always annoying  don t see why the story has to be about a girl who was committed to beauty standards. i suppose you might say  well  april from tmnt did . at that point... mm... s pose  not a big enough tmnt fan to care though i guess. i don t think she s exactly ugly  like quasimodo or anything
finally someone is speaking the truth about this hot garbage!
big o neil. lol
it s time to sabotage the past!
the original april in the comics was black
not my april.
no this is hollywood that fucks with everything we fans love it will never change!!
ok  i really don t mind race swap but my issue with this is she reminded of a person who hate the world say she victim  and dog on u if you are friends with her she put u down for no reason i know she not going be like that the feeling i get when see this version cringe
the body positivity movement has gone way way to far! if you are an average girl with an average height of 5 4 then you should probably weigh around 120. if you are 10-20  heavier you might still be relatively healthy and that puts you from 132-144. but the average weight of an average american 5 4 woman is now 170 lbs! if you are 170 you are not healthy no matter how thick you may think you are! this april looks around 170 and she is promoting early death!anyone who reads this comment and thinks i am full of it or dont have empathy well you should know that i have hypothyroidism and am diabetic. since i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism i have since lost 100 pounds  and now only have my final 20lbs to go  so i 100  understand it s hard as hell and am epathetic. but the truth hurts! your heart cannot pump enough blood when you are obese and your bones cant take the excess weight  and it will kill you!an obese fat acceptance influencer recently died in her 30s! don t let that be you!
im curious would melonie think my characters are beautiful
why teenage april is whoopi goldberg now
seth rogen ...need we say more
the libs got ahold of her lol
is this a movie   or a show   i m barely tapping into the information about it.
member when they said  janet jackson is ugly cuz she s black    no one does... no one.
ong we can t have shit these days without twitter hobos
they can still make fat characters with feminine bodies  they somehow made her look like a dude. the april from the latest series was cute
tmnt fan since  87.....this is just a wtf iteration of april......next time they will have april be a boy that wants to be a girl with a beard. inmates running the asylum these days....
weird that you guys are trying to see a sexy character in a kids movie
yeah how about we admit that the movie looks good overral besides april and aprils look dosen t even matter because april has always been the least intresting charcter in the franchise so i don t care how she looks like but the movie will be fun
@vigilantiks  i don t think her looks were a big part of the lore at all plus i m talking generally we watch ninja turtles for the turtles them selves and their adventures that s why i watch them anyways i don t care about april and i m not the reason why they do this i m not pro race swapping for no reason but at the same time i look at the overall movie and look for the positives and the positives are strong the movie is gonna be great april wouldn t ruin it cause the movie is not about her it never was it s about the turtles and that s what matters and a side note ever sense nickelodeon got the rights to ninja turtles april has always been fully clothed doesn t show cleavage doesn t show any skin and i prefer that it makes her character less distracting and not overly sexualized and fetchised like the old versions of april
nope that april was beaten with a uglystick realy realy hard
hollywood needs to stop.
why is april o neil ugly in mutant mayhem    because she reflects the souls of the show-runners.
first  it s cruel and idiotic to even intentionally hate or judge someone based on their appearance because there are some parts of their bodies that they have no control over. also  why should april being ugly even matter in the first place  if the creators chose to design her like a native african woman from ethiopia  what difference would it make  the original april o neal from the  80s is still around  she s not gonna get permanently erased from the entire tmnt franchise. it s just idiotic that so many people go flipping tables and jumping off buildings simply because a famous character of their childhood changed their appearance. it s exactly like what happened to aerial when she was played by a black female actor in the new the little mermaid live-action remake. and also  this  beauty standards  argument is something that has been challenged for several years now. women and men are not bound to abide by society s rules on how to be the ideal model. they are free to dress how they want  look how they want  and live how they want  it s not to us internet users to direct them anywhere  and if they were to eventually end up in a hot mess where they have diabetes  obesity  varicose veins  aging skin  then that is very much their fault. i first watched the new movie  mall cop 2   and the acting cast was built differently compared to other films. they hired a group of ugly and unattractive people to play as security guards in the film. it caught me off guard at first until i heard that this was actually a good thing because hollywood is constantly searching for the most beautiful and attractive people they can find  which is hard. it takes time to get the right people together. so for once in a lifetime  they decided to settle for hiring less attractive people. my thoughts are probably because it was not only more accessible that way  but also for those who have an unhealthy lifestyle to see themselves with these actors as well.after all  i could care so much less if april was white  black  latina  asian  or any other. if she acted better than velma  she would gain new fans that would praise her. but looking from the outside in  this whole april o neal race swap controversy is nothing more than a crowd of nostalgia-tards whining like babies because they can t keep up with the times  and they hate the modern times  so they choose to stay behind because that s where their glory years really shined.
my favorite harry potter character is ima biggit
her design looks bad  they could of at least make her look good if they want her black. on another note shredders revenge is a fun game to plays. style reminds me of the old cartoon
from tall  curvy  white  redhead to a fat  short  black  redhead. if they wanted a change they could have just made her black while its still an unnecessary change they didn t need to out of their way to try and make her the opposite of classic april  kind of weird to make a black women short and fat when they are trying to be inclusive
same reason you are a grifter. they think it will make them money.
i preferred the rise of tmnt s iteration than this one
why you so smart  i love you
april o meal
they are cancelling my culture be reforming april o neil.
it s just a cartoon guys and we just be happy they made her
the time we live in is just ridiculous. i m black and don t like the character design either. i m tired of race swaps  and tokenism or making characters black and gay   unattractive  etc  box ticking . give us new black characters and leave the original character designs alone. sheesh.
didn t you guys catch splinter with f kin afro
i m personally cool with the design i m not the biggest fan of the old april o neils design something about the old designs i just didn t like i also don t understand why people have beauty standard for fictional characters also there are multiple versions multiple universes of different o neils not all of them are models but that s just my opinion
fun fact less than 2 percent of the world s population has red hair  making it the rarest hair color in the world. be she of irish  scottish  or whatever other lineages if you want to talk about diversity and whatnot seeing how that is how the character has portrayed the most. if we play by their warped views rules they literally just infringed upon one of the rarest percentages of people in the world! but she had white skin still so i guess they didn t care to think about it and did a needless race swap of yet another established character instead of making someone or something new and original and made her statistically unattractive...
i m a black guy and i agree  this is the ugliest april we ve ever had. i don t care if she s black or not  she was actually black in a few of the old comics   i just care if she s hot or not. and this one is definitely not hot.
what i get from this video is that you think there s too much sista girlfriending and n word nonsense going on
the racism argument that some idiots are using is completeley stupid  i have a lot of black friends that didn t like this april at all  and they want the classic red hair design. i ve even seen black youtubers that aren t happy with this and want the classic april  and no  she was never black in the original comics  on her first appearance on issue  2  she looks just like in the 1987 cartoon  and the  afro  hair photo comes from issue  11  and she just had perm there  just like many white women in the 80 s
yeah and i hope this cartoon flops at the box office and you ll whine about it later!!
ok  what the hell  there is nothing about that character is april. if you showed that to anyone they would have zero idea what character that is supposed to be.
this thing is not april o neill
she went from april o neal to april obese.
omg please read this i just started reading the new x-23 comic it just came out called deadly regenisis- i m pretty sure the villain is trans. please give it a look i would love a video on all the bs characters they are trying to force feed us. and they suck as characters too.
fatphobia is wild
back in the day  my black friend told me he thought it was cool that i liked black girls. i replied   there are all kinds of beautiful women of all ethnicities. you re telling me you never seen a beautiful   white woman  black woman  asian woman  indian woman  latina or hispanic women    conclusion- why limit yourself
this is definitely not april. bruh  i wanna see these same people do the exact same response when they make tiana from disney into a white woman.
so... the person who thought about making this movie is an adult right  if not then the workers shouldn t allowed their kids take over their work.
wearing velma clothes doesn t help.
they ruined april
the art style is not good for an entire movie.  it s too crazy.
was calling her april lizzo  but might have to steal yours. haha
when i think strong characters i always go back to anime like chi-chi and nami and sakura  even though she is useless i mean sakura  and males goku luffy and naruto i don t think someone like peter griffon from family guy or stan from an american dad
im offended you called rise art style ugly  it was literally the best ninja turtles we ve gotten and that april was the best we ve gotten cause she was smart and a badass and i personally think she s cute but obviously this is my opinion
i m not the  biggest fan of april s redesign and i heard that the original april design wasn t white she was latino or had some color like that.i appreciate there gesture of trying to incorporate more actors if color but this isn t how you do it and it dose feel wired that when they show april as a different race they completely shape shift her body.am i saying that all the hateful comments are needed no but i feel like the way they are handling race and inclusion in films isn t right or dosent feel natural imo
it is a very stylized depiction of this world. so i think you should chill. all of the characters are stylize. the style is really grungy and rough. i like it. if it bothers you that much...sucks for you i guess. lol. at the end of the day  it is some one else s depiction of the tmnt world. get over it.
rippa is wrong  she was based off of one of the creators x girlfriend and or wife  she was a mixed  biracial woman  which is how she was originally depicted  the toy companies pressured the creators so that they could sale toys.
have you seen a mirror
i mean it s a cartoon.  it s for kids and if you re an older fan like myself  then you just hope for a good show.  it s not the april o neal show.  if you re butt hurt over being attracted to a cartoon  switch to the hub and get your fix there.
okay in my honest opinion i don t care what race or skin color april o neil is i don t even care if she s a bombshell or not i really don t the only thing i care about is she s a likeable character. that s all that matters to me. that being said i think this is getting out of hand i think everybody and i do mean everybody needs to come down and chill out if people like this design that s fine if people don t like the design that s fine as well  there is no right or wrong answer to this. i know for a fact that people that are complaining about this design aren t  bigots or racist i m really sick people using those words but i m also tired of people using  woke  or  modern audience excuse. i m fully aware when it comes to the comics april o neil wasn t black i don t doing some research i heard that she s either white  mix i even her at one point she was going to be asian at one point but like i said before i really don t care about the race. this ain t the first time people were complaining about the design or  portrayed about april o neil remember that statement you were made about why can t be attractive bombshell   originally we did have that those michael bay teenage mutant ninja turtle movies where the character was played by megan fox she was gorgeous in that movie but audience and fans still criticize her playing character. the 2012 cgi cartoon series for nickelodeon had april o neil as a teenage kid and some people were criticize about that. and then we come to the rise of the teenage mutant ninja turtle series where this was the first time april o neil was a african-american and not surprised people were criticizing that as well. i think it s safe to is so assumed when it comes to this new movie the target audience is the kids not older turtle fans.
i haaaated rise  they didn t get the turtle s personalities right either. a giant  ugly mess to me
she was named after her not based off of her. learn how to read.
bahahahahah
april o  nesha
tbf  all the characters got hit with the ugly stick there...
rogan s favorite phrase  shabbas goy   ----reference to gentile slaves
why should she be beautiful all she needs to be is a girl and a friend to the turtles stop thinking that every version of april needs to be hot or sexy that is not what the character is about what so ever
thank you
they are cancelling gingers now
i m a fan but i m gonna pass on this one
she s a mutant now too lol
the movie is gonna tank. broke as hell.
we made april look a shit emoji  so we can blame racism when this movie doesn t do well.
you want a human side character that is beautiful and half-black  half indian  elisa maza  gargoyles show. that is all.
i mean regardless of how sexually appealing she is her personality is going to take a nosedive
angry joe already made a clown of himself on twitter attacking everyone  and i mean everyone  who criticized her look in any shape or form. previously his problem was that people criticized nebula s look on the guardians 3 poster. not only they had changed april s race but also made her look very stereotypical. i don t think it s us who s racist here! oh and btw. whoever says she was originally black in the comics that s bullshit she wasn t. there s even a video from eric d july about it  https   youtu.be fxh8m9tqexc
what the absolute fuck...! ! that is not april o neil! that is not the april o neil i remember from my childhood!
for my health  what if it s slow suicide
shaquilla o neal
i agree but theres this basketball player named shaq ..
damn what a shame. two baddies turned to dust.
but beauty is subjective why would you assume that everybody would consider this design ugly  i dont find her ugly  kinda seems like you are trying to make a big deal out of this whole thing. because they didn t  intentionally  make her ugly  why would they  who knows maybe the designer of april thought it was a pretty design
y all are sexualizing a teenager too much
i thought they hated stereotypes
@nisa tyson  i was there frodo 10 000 years ago when the black and white comic came out you have no power here
@nisa tyson  you ll understand when you re older
@theslicknessedm  wdym i ll understand when i m older i m 18 and don t look for a sexy character in a kids cartoon
wtf u mean stereotypes
frumpy o neal
lol i made this observation and someone got triggered so i am glad you are here basically saying the same thing.
for me it s only a no because seth rogan is involved.
tmnt went downhill a long time ago. i much prefer the classic animated series.
seems like just another self insert character.
clouts will do stoop to anything for views these days
it don t matter what we or u think only what mikey thinks of her agreed
so if a black actress was cast as april in a live action movie because she was the best one for the character i m ok with that or if they wanted to change her race based on the best voice actress available i m ok with that but she doesn t look good here
definitely will skip this lol...
different types of people exist.  just keep being mad about it.  i can t believe this is someone s career xd
why do you need someone els too motivate you .
stop redhead erasure
and again with remove red heads wow
to be fair....  cue letterkenny ... she does now look like someone who would spend most of her spare time in a sewer eating nothing but pizza. loland also.... not sure it s just me or not.... but it goes with the constant trend lately of changing every traditionally red head white characters into black people. jimmy olsen  ariel  mary jane watson  wally west  etc.... dude what is up with that
is the new april just a black feminized version of seth rogan
i don t think you re wrong for not feeling the new april. she looks horrible and not everything needs to be black washed. at this point!! i m african-american well jamaican!! depending on your understanding but i also feel that it s not so much about the weight of the character because there are some beautiful big people out there  but she just looks like crap and this is another black washed character. it s getting really annoying out here in hollywood at this point it s almost like hollywood is just saying we re tired of you african americans complaining about representation so here you go!!! and i don t feel like anyone that doesn t like this is racist!.. not every character needs to be changed  the little mermaid i get some people that grew up watching the original movie!!. however  technically she s not real and she s a mermaid and if she was in the water all the time  i really highly doubt she would be caucasian. but that s my opinion on that subject but anyways  i just feel like not everything needs to be changed. i get new perspectives keeping these projects alive  but you don t always need to switch up characters that people fell in love with!.. sometimes all the fans are really asking for is better affects and script!.. i still remember when they change the daily planet character perry white  to lawrence fishburne i was like here s a character that doesn t have to be white. i actually like it he fits better to me!!  but this is trash. let s be honest i m not saying  main characters cannot be african-american  but pick and choose the ones a little bit better than this!!!  i always felt that april o neil   was supposed to be the beauty and turtles that were supposed to be a little hard on the eyes  but fun loving characters  nonetheless. just my opinion!!.
i m not going to see it i ll stick with tmnt 2007
simply tired of people race swapping existing characters just to appease  some  people. yeah she looks like a troll in this version even if you don t take the race swap into consideration. sad world we live in.ps. just saw the trailer and it actually looks really good expect for the april thing  p.
who are you to call someone ugly
seth  are you jewish  rogan
exactly
so she isn t a beauty because she looks different  ok
why didn t they just make the turtles black  call them teenage mutant niqqa turtles

i have a feeling they will probably make her gay too just because. there is too many fine black women they could of modeled her off of.
she is a news reporter  tell me how many ugly news reporters you see! i am in the tampa area  and most of them are high 7s to 9s!
the movie
what s the deal hollywood erasing redheads
what do you mean by that i m black too
april o neil was always a hot chick in a romper! why do people think otherwise  but besides that  what reporter on tv do you see looking like a frump  even girls doing news on youtube aren t frumpy and popular. lol why do people lie to themselves
check the 7 noahide laws   the 2800 slaves
i ll just watch the 2003 series again  this generation has gotten way to sensitive it s downright pathetic
another ginger character turned black. is there any gingers that are still gingers
its like theyre taking beautiful female characters and making them uglier and uglier. i don t get it.
april is ugly in this movie   yeah.  donatello wears square framed glasses.  rapheal is buck toothed.  april being ugly is par for the course in this film.
as someone who grew up in the 90s n loved all things turtles n collected all the action figures n toys n everything i hate how the remakes keep screwing up all the series that were my childhood lmao. n not tryin to be that guy i m just stating facts but in the original movies n cartoons n video games april o neil was white n now in this woke era they make her colored n a lil overweight just cuz they have to fill the quota that everything now has to have more colored people or diff ethnicities n are plus sized cuz if they don t then everyone screams white supremacy. n im 100  not racist n i m glad that more actors of color are getting roles n recognition in the acting community  i m just talking bout if their gonna remake an old series u should stay true to its roots n not remake all these classic characters in an image of something just because they have to do it now.
bro april o neil is white.........
subbed
bruh and they also are planing to make one of the turtles gay in the movie  why    i hate this era. changing loved characters just to please a minority.
your a beautiful lady
no black woman is going to be talking to a turtle.
another casualty to the great ginger extinction in media.
it looks like a dumpster fire
do a respect review of  i am jesus christ
this is how seth rogan views black people  they have sickle cell  twitch muscles  and diabetes.
why
dude this is a kids show  kids like to see people that look like them on screen and this iteration of april looks like a pretty average teen. if you don t like that she  a teenager in a kids show  doesn t look cute enough for you  go watch the older versions or something.
that title is gross.
because beyonce without all the fake human hair unattached looks like that.........
why does matter
some people called me racist cuz i said that i think race-swapping existing characters is lazy and dumb. and i agree they should ve at least made april attractive  but  they instead made her look like an overweight hipster dude. it s very confusing.  frankly  i think this version of april looks like a potato
everybody  implies that youre talking about people  those who agree with this disgusting  april o neil  thing are not people lmao
law of salehow to attract  money to uu attract sale to your producthow to attract saleu attract people to buyhow to attract people u make your product attractive
she is a child
this is ridiculous. she s a reporter not a victoria secret model. megan fox was the hottest april but that didn t save those movie from being comple garbage.
why are all characters ugly today in the hands of hollywood
what do you mean melonie this new april o neil looks just like beyonce and is even better looking than beyonce  she is on par with velma now.no more tall  white  good looking  slim and well dressed april now it is time for a small goblin looking like velma 2023.
based take
i m black and april looks terrible
wokeness
from megan fox to this. why do they try to destroy characters  why not make them revelant or interesting  no one likes ugly people in the movies.
@guts berserk  lol. you re really out of touch
@emu in the cupboard  you right. i don t won t any thing  to do with that kind of shit show coming.
pro tip  the same small group of people are choosing to replace redheaded women with black women every time it happens.
cinema really has something against white red headed women as of lately. ariel. mj. april... jessica rabbit is next.
i love seeing ppl get a butt hurt abt  race swaps  when they were black to begin with  but besides the point let ppl drawn they re characters how they want to and jus enjoy the movie  april being white has never been apart of her character and she has flipped from being black and white over the years jus deal with it  also  ugly  u define a black woman who is a lil bigger as ugly
leave redheads alone
2023 baby!
april was originally black not white but they did not do her justice
a thin whoopi goldberg.
i was more annoyed with another character being black washed. after hearing it being pointed out  yeah  she s pretty unattractive when she s suppose to be.  now i wish she was an attractive black woman over this plus size look  lol
the fact that you see a trailer and your main concern is the beauty of a character just shows one thing  you r superficial. you literally want the character to be the pretty journalist stereotype. the character in the old tv show was unintresting she had nothing going for it but in this trailer it looks like she will have a better role and here you are complaining about the beauty of the character.
1 22 oh i think she is not an attractive because of her race  don t let anyone to tell you what kind of women should you find an attractive  someone does not find asian girls attractive  someone does not find caucasian women attractive and someone does not find any female attractive coz they are into animals...what if i say i don t like blondes i m violating rights of blonde women or what it s just my taste  it is how it is  simple as that!!
she looks frumpy
woke america is ridiculous  they don t create nothing good  just race swap second grade characters out of nowere. now its really plausible she has an affair with the ninja turtles since she looks like one now.
absurd... if people can t see the absolutely obvious differences - or more to the point they just swapped out the character - then people are delusional...sorry i m not even going to attempt to tone it down. it s just a bad joke. once again that is...
cool self-report! making a character black makes them unattractive  got it.
this has no sense...the first version of april was a mix ethnic slim woman  in the comics    so having her portrayed as black or chinese is ok  but chubby fat   not atletic and not attractive  new velma style  ... the hell  oo why you do have characters that fit this quota on tmnt story  like irma this is plain ugly just because  on the side that looks like she has some unhealty food dissorder this is a terrible messageshe is always fit  in all her reinterpretations  including her youngst self seen on 2012 tnmt  in which she became a ninja
and we have yet another reason to hate seth rogan.
shaquille o neal s isn t black
the sjw cult fetish of blackwashing iconic redheads is blatant. their uglified version of great characters. this is why the east   europe is winning in pop culture   entertainment. in a way  i m glad.. i m saving my money for the better things in life
hate to say this but this is how women look nowadays. it s accurate. ask the new generation what bmi is.
for those saying she is racistyall  no one is angry for the fact that she is black  is the fact that they changed her race  if she was originally black  and changed her for white now  i m sure yall would be mad af.
no she wasn t originally black  look up youngrippa s video on this
master splinter should not be played by jackie chan. also why is moses malone in it  what does that baboon know about martial art movies
2018 april was amazing but this makes me a little nauseous  i know this is animated yeah but at least remove some weight she can still be chubby yes  but this is a little absurd  she s a teen yeah some teens can be overweight but that s a little much and looks like some middle aged woman. just a little bit slimmer not too slim just enough to be  more healthy looking but still noticeably chubby you feel  also chill lady
what makes her ugly  dark skin  yeah you re being racist  when you say she s ugly.
i was with you completely until you started talking about fat people and beauty i ve seen as you say fat women that are far more beautiful than you are they can be beautiful too
you should cool up on the racism  people being black doesn t make them ugly
this is direspecful to the source material  shredder revenge game absolute good justice to tmnt! please dont release it outside us.. i m not gonna watch it.even begin with trailer is worst.
i mean i don t really care if a characters skin color is changed  but you calling her  ugly  is straight-up racist  sorry
why do they keep race swapping every white ginger character that s racist
hollywood keeps putting white characters in blackface.it s hilarious!
i think there is an effort to make women as ugly  and hairy  as possible so that trans-women can pass easier.  as if lowering that bar would make that possible.  smh
for me  it is about race. they started it. it s about race for them. i didn t need a mulatto hercules or aladdin and i love and related to them. this is about their racism. they see white skin and must change it. i didn t have that because i m not racist like them.
fat isn t attractive. no excuses. no arguments. facts are facts. anyone arguing this is fat or stupid. ask them which applies to them.
splinter has a fro donnie is non binary ladyboy
the yt people are at it again
mate  she s like 13 in this film. it would be 1000x worse if they tried to make her hot
the next step will be turning april into a trans  or outright lesbian.
yes you are
thats racist thats raacist-!!!!!
why is no race swap or gender swap from colored to white or female to male  happening
why april look like a dude like my god that isn t april  that s aiden
@eleru777  that s my point.  what about her appearance is ugly  if she was a lighter shade would she still be considered ugly  is it all about the weight  for the record when i saw the character i took it as a younger take  like 12-14 years old so i m not expecting any attraction   many races have a colorist aspect where darker skinned isn t considered attractive. that was my question.
that white skinny april wasn t beautiful to begin with tf yal talking bout
ugly is the new beautiful you know lol
and another redhead gone....
lizzo is not beautifull stop saying that  she is an out of shape black woman  being out of shape is not good at all and this doesnt have to do with being black there are beautifull black woman but now is acceptable be out of shape  not only they didnt respect the original character they destroy it
ya ll mad lmao
that s hollywood for you
yall being hella disrespectful rn
i m not gonna sound mean but you do know you going to tick off a lot of people and they will call you racist
i m sure the script will be woke lgbt  anti white
it s marketing. hollywood executives figure that if you change the gender of a male character  and or the race of a white character  everybody will talk about it  so that s free publicity.
i m down with having a different  april for once we saw megan fox she was hot then the both chicks from the original ninja turtles movies were ok the animated series the new one april is different. give it a chance and lets see where it goes.
just imagine how it s like to have black people constantly erased from stories!
why is it always gingers
what tha freakin  hell  that is not april o neil. she is not black. and i don t care what anybody else says  thinks  and or shows me. they can call me a bigot all they want. i don t care. she is not black.
idc about her look  i m just tired of the race-swapping...not sorry. it s literally being forced at this point.  movies and shows are trash now.  i only watch things from the 90s these days.
honestly i m excited for the movie but why tf can t april look attractive  like why do females gotta either look like men or freaking look ugly  are there not beautiful women in the world
stick to the original comic and cartoon  imagery and create your own race or sex character for new programing
i d rather date a turtle from the third movie.
cry about it.
well she s supposed to be a 16 year old in this movie. idk about you but i m not watching children s cartoon movies with the intentions of finding the underage characters attractive. ew. maybe you shouldn t be allowed around kids
this is all a big troll. april o bese has checked 2 boxes already. want to bet she ll check a third box also. keep talking about this. get the normies to notice. get seth rogan to open his big mouth on social media.
coming from a 17 yr-old black girl why does it matter what april looks like
race swapping is worst thing
she s pretty tho what am i trippingbro you literally said the most fat phobic things in this video you said she s  fat masculine  i don t care if  fat  or chubby isn t healthy  and she isnt even fat she just has a little weight. also  masculine    i love masculine people. why hate her  alsobeauty standards are toxic. also how dare you guys compare her to velma.you even made fun of 2018 april o neil   bro these are literally just teenagers she is so pretty and i don t care what you guys say
i m black and i approve this video. i m so sick of them changing shit!
i don t mind april being black but making her fat  seriously cmon  now! do better hollywood. do better.
ya racist it s simple.
it s not only bigotry... its racist
tmnt is correct  women are larger now. overweight is now the new normal. even jones should be overweight.
who cares can people stop complaining just stop
so many cringe takes. im so sick of ppl crying about race swaped characters. not everything is velma ffs. april was black before. the origanal comics had her dark skinned non-white. theres already been a black april in a cartoon too. like jesus  wish yall put this energy into complaining about things that actually matter.
woah
same shit we get in black panther. masculine-looking women
racism..................................................................................................................................................................................bluntly
i don t really see the issue here  y all seem like you re being crazy sensitive.
and another erasure of the ginger
april o neil looks like lori lightfoot now.  doesn t matter to me though  i don t support race-swapped content.
im glad this teaser is getting the backlash it deserves for that one character it gives me hope that they ll fix her i don t have a prob that she s black but the nerdy hipster sjw look is a big no no
the race swap is bad and it looks like a poorly animated picasso painting missing a ton of frames with dialogue like it was written by a bunch of 10 year olds and they sound like it too.
you mean obesity  not diabetes. nevermind  i like the style of this new tmnt  but i m sick and tired of all the race swapping.
your beautiful
the fact that you are only 17 and asked this question shows you are not versed on the character whatsoever lol
looks don t matter
i feel like y all just don t like black women
the whole movie looks terrible.
cuz they made her black  they meaning jews
fatphobic
how shallow.
switching to an established white character just to flaunt inclusivity seems hypocritical to me
because you have bad taste
why is only conservatives that have an issue with  do you not see how pathetic this is
this is so bad. you got know and realize that this absolutely intentional. they do this crap because they can cry  racist  and get away with it. it s horrible. it s really  really bad. one of the worse designs yet  even with velma. jesus.
diabetics are being pushed as new beauty standard   gmo   sugar   anti depressants   consumerism
cry more.
it s a cartoon why do you care so much
omg why the hell do y all care about this there just cartoons
this is the worst april design that has ever existed. the design is so ugly looking  april is supposed to be cute and idc about her race because in rise of the tmnt she is black and i like her character in rise this is just ridiculous
chill out it s a cartoon
w take
bulimia is not beautiful
who cares
is she queer and non binary too  holywood  fan baiting again.
girl no one gaf
ok
people are really upset a cartoon isn t hot
i am black. both of my parents are black  my grandparents are black. my last name is scottish. fun fact most black americans have european last names  because  well nm. o neal is a popular black last name. all of you all know of at least one black person with the last name o neal  i ll give you a hint he is a 3x nba champion who played for the lakers and the heat.  so the whole  her last name is oneil so she has to be irish thing is just lazy. beyond that. this movie seems to be focusing on being true to the source material. the comics. in the original comics april is portrayed as black or latina.also the characters we see are much younger. the turtles are clearly in their young teens. maybe  just maybe  making a teenage april  hot  by conventional standards wasnt the focus.this is a dumb video. if you are upset that you are 35 years old and not attracted to this 13-16yr old representation of april then you are just a weirdo.also  lets be real. y all are mad she is black.
it s crazy how one little teaser trailer caused so many racists and bodyshamers show their true colours...
lets see how people react if they raceswap shaft into an albino white man. i mean whats the point  stay original and true to source or make frikin new material !!!
racist keren
the animation is hideous too  it s like a bad imitation of the animation from spiderman  into the spiderverse movie.
hello beautiful
it s a kid what are you talking about and not every character on screen is going to be visually appealing and also realize that beauty standards are different to every person not everyone is a super model or something.
first off we haven t seen that much of her second of all she was not race swapped she was mixed in comics
1 48 wanting her attractive isn t racist. wanting her attractive for the age they were going for in this film  that s sus af
i am with you. this iteration of april is not cute at all and it s ok to find her unattractive. hell it s plenty of white unattractive characters in animation genre ugly is ugly regardless of the color
i literally am black  not mixed  and i agree with this. why did they have to make her obese  i literally could ve came up with a cute black april design and made it better. why d they give her glasses   why is black representation in movies and tv always like this  they always make them obese and often lgbt at the same time for some reason  like maybe they are too lazy to add a lgbt character  so they combine  minorities   black  fat  gay  etc  and put it all in one character  idk  it s just so annoying   i am in no way racist or homophobic it s just an observation
attractive women are illegal these days
none of y all watching this are tmnt fans like at all   know nothing about tmnt or even keep up with it
i got into tmnt very late. not until  like  the late 80s.but yeah  april was always hot!today today beauty isn t allowed to exist. could you maybe wear a mask  malonie you re way too good looking for modern beauty standards...
boohoo wah wah
well considering there are black people with english  scottish  or irish names . you can t look at her name and say  hey she has a white name being black doesn t matter to me  i just think her new design is wrong. she looks old. she looks chubby  she is like  forty   lol. but seriously people are making such a fuss over april being black when we are literally talking about turtles who know ninjitsu.
not you
this is horrible
why do you care over beauty it s a cartoon your on a whole ramble over beauty about a cartoon
no the people didnt upset  people been want a justice to be respect a source material a true original tmnt.. no one upset here seth rogan he is the one to blame caused every drama here.even in the original are slim white beautiful girl even shredder always kidnap her whatever he wants too.
@02 alpha zero  yea  ok.
proofs
wdym
she s not obese you re pushing it
two types of people are probably mad over this1  daily rule34 april weiner jiggler2  raicist peoplewait...
you re really are committed to your roleplaying  aren t you  boy
fax
you are body shaming  there is no reason to say she is not cute. all shapes and sizes are beautiful. don t be shitty.
mhm- yeah yeah- you guys are just mad that times are changing and people can have artistic liberties  and shes a teenager in this movie  and in different ones shes a news reporter  not a frickin victorias secret model  dont diss a movie that isnt even out yet  now can everyone just shut up and just be happy with what we got and stop complaining about everything that they see
there are ppl in the world who look like the new april  you are being completely disrespectful and disgusting talking about the character in that way and after watching this channel  stop using the word  woke  and say what you really want to say. this channel is disgusting
why do we care how she looks  beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. we shouldn t judge people by their looks.
you ain t no beauty queen either.
yall are weird
go outside and kick rocks or play in traffic.
