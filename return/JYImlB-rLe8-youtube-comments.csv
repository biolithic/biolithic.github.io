you just restored my faith in humanity s common sense    nuff said.

unfortunately melonie there will always be persecution but dont let it discourage you. here s why  when they persecute you that means your doing something right. Jesus even said that people hated him and they will hate us for his names sake. so stay strong in the faith and in the Lord Jesus and never let your strength weaken

be strong. we are told we will be persecuted for our faith. just continue to share the truth and he will take care of you.

melonie its real women like you who restore my faith in humanity. thank you sweetheart.

as a fellow Christian mel let me just encourage you by saying that if we re not being persecuted we probably aren t standing up for Christ. God bless and stay faithful.
yes  she can use whatever pronouns she wants  and like grammarly  melonie will continue to correct her.

I thought you might be Christian and am so grateful you professed faith in this video! happy to see my sister-in-Christ being bold in the faith!

getting back into my faith over these past couple years and waking up to the current social programming and nonsense has been a game changer for mebut seeing how all that was confusing to me as a woman in her 30 s

thanks melonie for being a strong independent woman who doesnt hate men. its super refreshing to hear women like you speak up!

thanks for being brave enough to say what a majority of people are thinking
