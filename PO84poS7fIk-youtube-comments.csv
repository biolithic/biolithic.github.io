this just makes me love top gun maverick even more. the hero comes back  he s older and is haunted by some things in his past but proves to still be the best there is  overcomes his demons  and moves on with his life  with his girlfriend  and mends the relationship with his surrogate son in rooster.
and now a moment of silence for indiana jones. you will be missed sir.
i m actually incredibly disappointed in harrison ford for taking part in destroying his own legacy. what he hell man.
lol  the new  hero  saves the day by punching out an 80  year old man
indiana jones was never perfect  but he always maintained a positive moral framework and strength of character. now they want to tear him down like all positive male role models in our society. predictable.
the real  arkimeeds  needs to tag-team with  soh-crates  to wipe out the entire lot of actors  screenwriters  and production team involved with this abomination.
sure .indiana jones fought the huge sherpa and huge nazi mechanic in the first movie .and also the huge slave master in the second one  all played by pat roach  and never got knocked out .but tiny woman lays a smack down and he goes out light a light
can t be that hard to knock out an 80 year old indy. i m calling elder abuse.
i have no idea how melonie has never heard of archimedes before  he s like george washington level of pop culture.
come in 2024  phoebe waller-bridge   kathleen kennedy are gonna find out why they shouldn t let their mouths write checks their asses can t cash
kathleen has done everything in her power to remove any trace of george lucas. one of the scenes they allegedly cut out of the movie was a piece that would basically  literally erase indiana jones from the timeline. he would have never existed and those movies would have the subtitles  legends .
phoebe waller-bridge   notice me! everyone   who are you again
i ve heard rumors that she plays  the unspoken race religion  so if you speak ill of the movie you are anti-semitic. she single handily defeats the nazi party to get revenge for her race  something a straight while colonizing christian male could never do.
hey harrison ford why do your characters keep getting overshadowed by a younger female who knows better than them   because disney keeps paying me
this movie sounds like a train wreck ngl. i would to see you do a voice over review for this. you re the best at that . the unrealistic woman taking out fully grown man tropefor me the last indiana jones movie was indiana jones and the last crusade.anyways another great video melonie. always great to see you. you look beautiful. your hair looks amazing. i hope you have a wonderful day.
you took the words right out of my mouth when you said the trend seems to be  mad at anything with exploration. it s very strange.
the real crime here is not a big stinker bomb of a movie or show we can just ignore and pretend doesn t exist. the real crime is that in many cases  this is the last time we can hope to get stars like harrison ford  leonard nimoy  carrie fisher and warwick davis among others to saddle up and reprise roles. they can be recast or perhaps video faked  but the precious  unrecoverable chance for a final authentic performance has been lost. that i can neither forgive nor forget.
for me the franchise stopped at the last crusade. it s just sacrilege after that  this film is gonna be so bad
jonsie rides into the sunset in last crusade so there are only 3 indiana jones.
melonie mac   do you seriously believe your own hype that much  phoebe waller-bridge   i am the hype!!!
a sequel better than the original imo
a cinematic masterpiece.
@fista zombie it basically is the original
luke in the last jedi did the same thing
maverick was a fantastic movie. saw it three times at theaters and now own it on 4k
the franchise already died on the previous entree
without harrison ford it is gone imo. it was great  and sometimes great stories must end.
what do you mean  crystal skull was a fever dream
indy is fine. he rode with father and friends into the sunset.the story ended.all other is very bad anti-fan fiction.
just cap it at last crusade and you re good.
wait  didn t he have his last adventure in 1989 the answer is yes.  yes he did.
watch the movie firstly  then i come back here to say anything about it imo
indiana jones and the diarrhea of destiny . poor indy
@earthatom7  better than useless bud light indy the zimmer frame years.
he had a perfect trilogy and a b- side story. crystal skull was far from perfect but the first three were cake icing candle. the last one was like a decent present. it wasn t horrible but it wasn t a brand new car.
he is old. and this is good money for him.
it s not even the first time  kennedy did it to him in the force awakens.
the almighty dollar.
@vicious alien klown  to be fair.. he never liked han by his own admission. so i can see him agreeing to that  even if i don t agree. but him doing this to indy who he says he loved and always wanted to protect  yeah.. this makes no damn sense.
me too.  i m guessing he agreed and then the plot kept changing as well as dialogue etc. may have even lied to him about the ending.
ummm.... kingdom of the crystal skull  blade runner 2049  han solo in the woke trilogy harrison has been vandalizing his earlier work for years.
trucks loads of money
@thomas k  whoa whoa .blade runner 2049 was pretty solid
@vicious alien klown  the force awakens was watchable  the other two can be set on fire along with kk. besides thats  he wantes han killed off.
nah  the franchise forever lives on with the trilogy!
.....
yea that south park episode comes to mind
he went from indiana jones to geriatric jones.
indiana jones ended in 1992
from what i understand  he refused to let anyone else play indy. they talked about getting chris pratt to play him and ford was like  as long as i m alive only i get to wear that hat.  or something of that nature. but besides that i m not sure he had much sway on how this was going to turn out. after all  mark hamill loves luke skywalker and what luke meant to fans  and i m quite sure he tried real hard to not let that get ruined but we all saw what happened there. if mark can t sway the film makers i m not sure anyone could. but yeah i agree  it totally sucks. as if crystal skull wasn t bad enough  they screw up the one thing that was actually somewhat decent in that film  and thats him and marion ending up together. but in this film they are divorcing. like seriously though  who did they think wants to see our boy indy dismantled like that
harrison ford has always been pretty open about purely taking roles for money. i love him but he likes to get his bag  and knows he doesn t have much time left to even take roles.
ford is all about the check.  nothing else matters.
pretty sure he was contractually obligated to this movie when it was announced all the way back into 2014-15....
@megnetical  yeah  but participating in the destruction of a cherished ip is criminal.  indiana jones is part of our societal culture that is one of the myths used by our society to pass on our values to the next generation.  just b c a corp owns the ip doesn t mean it can culturally appropriate and destroy it at whim.  our myths  legends  heroes and heroines in a sane society not governed by the enemy within  would be regulated like a utility  not allowed to just destroy our cherished western culture until there s nothing left  which is the intention.  once our culture is destroyed  so will we be.  first in effigy  then irl.  this has happened over and over in history if ppl could read  they d understand the danger close we are in.  even history will forget us.history is written by the winners... and we re gone.  we are being erased for years now  and not a peep  not a protest  not a boycott.
the dude is just a bitter old man that hates acting at this point  he doesn t care about any of it.
it might have been a contractual obligation.
harrison ford never had love for fans though. he is not part of the fold.
he never really cared it was just a job- i mean i like him in movies but his heart is not in it. i mean he is not a fan.
@lissbirds  i passed the cpa exam many years ago.  i know business law.  any contract can be broken if you re willing to take the financial hit.  if the financial hit was so onerous it could never have been a choice  don t sign that contract.every person maintains choice.  hamill squirted out the udder milk willingly  bringing great dishonor to once an honorable character.  the second he threw his light saber over his shoulder  he ceased to exist to me.  the same with thor mimbo in 2016 fish ghostbusters  non-entity.  cavill in the witcher in name only  the same... on and on.  any man willing to defame himself and his character loses his right to exist in my mind.  they are the enemy within.businesses break contracts all the time.  just by signing one doesn t mean you re now an indentured servant.
folks keep giving mark hamill and harrison ford a pass for mocking and defiling their own characters by citing some nebulous  contractual obligations.  the truth of the matter is both of them cared far more about the paycheck than they did about what happened to their characters.
@nateo123  why would ford be bitter   his wealth is too hard on him  or is it his inability to fly anything without crashing   it is possible the injuries he suffered in his last plane crash keeps him in constant pain.  too bad  his choice  his consequences.  now that he crashed his character s honor and himself in the process  another non-entity  an enemy within.
@cautionary tale harris  i hope they both get what they deserve  as soon as possible.  both the enemy within  because taking away role models from our children is pure evil.  without anything positive  what chance do our boys have   make no mistake how important our cherished myths  legends  heroes and heroines are to our children  and why they are being culturally appropriated and destroyed en masse.
@thomas k  kingdom of the crystal skull was not bad. it wasn t woke  and it still felt like the classic indiana jones films.
yer he s too old and has no integrity. compared to henry cavill who would not play a character because of his high standards for that character.
me too. i mean....to agree to star he d have had to have read the script. he probs took the cash and said fuck it! im 80 got nowt to prove so yeah  fuck it! lmao.
@kindel mcdermott  chris pratt would be a good indy
i really don t think harrison ford gives a shit about his pop culture characters. legacy  sure. but he s more than just a handful of fan favorites over the decades. he ll take the money which is fine but he certainly doesn t care what others do to his classic roles.
glad there s people who are no longer with us to witness the downfall of western entertainment as they had their good fill of entertainment. and enjoyed its juiciness while it lasted
i agree. this is the real news  we all knew this movie would be woke garbage but harrison ford s favorite character was indiana jones and he agreed to do this.
@david silva  his net worth is  300m. he doesn t need the money.
the old man probably just wanted to be finally done with the role  no matter what.
@david silva  he is a multimillionaire already. don t feel bad for the old man.
@baronvg  aye. very workmanlike attitude towards his films only bigging them up via signed contractual obligations.
he already did with the crystal skull movie and the star wars remakes.sad.
he did it too han too. he only agreed to come back if they d kill him off. talk about not being grateful for what gave you your start in life..
ford dosent care that much as long as he gets paid.  while he does seem to like indy he actually hates most the characters he has played.
@cmortonwvu  actually i think we he signed on it was before spielberg said he wasn t gonna be part of the movie.
like he cares
@loulikestowatch  cavill played the witcher when all his job was  was to get the humpback her own vehicle  her own show.  that character  not in the lore or original pc game as they portrayed her  actually become more ugly after her  humpback  was cured.  i never wished harm on a fictional character and the showrunners  writers and actresses more in my life.season 2 was so bad  i stopped watching that cultural appropriation and destruction social warfare weapon. cavill knew the lore  he watched and participated in his own character s defamation  and destruction.  i person can say anything  that s easy.  watch what they do.  cavill like thor boy  sjw luke  etc.  participated in the defamation  disrepute and destruction of their once honorable  cherished and useful characters.  f  them all  honestly.   i had a contract  is irrelevant  they could have at any time walked away and not drank the titty milk  played a mimbo  been a vehicle just to advance their female replacement  loki and hawkeye too  like cuckadoodledoos.  that was by design  that was the intention  that wasn t  a mistake.   evil hides behind incompetence.  period  full stop.
he s old he doesn t care anymore  he just wants a paycheck
harrison never struck me as someone who understand marxist propaganda or what story telling and strong characters mean to audiences. he s a natural action hero  photogenic stunt man dubbed sexiest man alive. i don t blame him for disney s political woke agenda bulldozing over him. i bet the disney machine is intimidating even to legends.
he has come out and did interviews bitching and complaining about how he got screwed.
he s an elderly man now  and i m guessing he couldn t resist the chance to revisit the prime of his life and try to relive his greatest days.
he s probably stopped caring about his legacy at this point. it s just a job to him  and he knew he d get a pay check for this so screw it.
he don t care  just wants that check.
he did the same in the travesty that is the force awakens
whenever you see that happen  like bob dylan letting his audience wait 5 hours  they might be in the category of sold souls.. those that just have to  hold up their end of the bargain   like dylan told 60 minutes.
dude the man is hurting for cash . cut him some slack will ya lol.
money
@david silva  he doesn t need the money. the op is right  what the hell was he thinking
genuinely when all is said   done.....this is a sad   pathetic end to an iconic cinematic character.
he likes money and he enjoys the work. it has been years since he cared about the quality of scripts or roles. i have noticed since he married callsta he just doesn t give a damn.
@kindel mcdermott    that is saying it mildly. rian said mark was a pain in the ass. he had an attachment to the character and kept telling him luke wouldn t do or say something in the script.  he said. do it as written mark  and he had to. and he did as a professional.
that s female empowerment for ya!
her-o  not hero.
it s okay  she s a victim
too true austin  too true. i couldn t put it better myself.
i saw the first 3 feature films as a teen  1980s . they were extremely popular  trend setter. the problem is hollywood can t wait 20-25yr then  re fresh  a film line. that s asking for problems.
the intro to part 2 where he gets punched in the face is epic
kk s man hating femanism is showing in all her projects.
@geoff shaw  really ironic because she was associative producer in indiana jones 2
only franchise that he s returned to that remained awesome was blade runner 2049. that movie is a masterpiece.
ex-cell-ent!
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman
that is a most excellent comment.
and genghis khan!!! he loves the sugar rush from twinkies.
not sure if n so-crates would agree to partner up with good ol ark-a-meeds !
your comment is most triumphant
you left out  playdo
lmfao
indiana jones and the excellent adventure.
someone needs to compile a list of her most commonly mispronounced words. not sure if she s up to rich evans status  as if that were possible   but every little bit helps!i d be surprised about it if it wasn t so on-brand too!
@baronvg  a better title than what we got.
they would make blade runnerthe thingand the matrix
you left out  hippo-crayts
ex-lent
play-toon

i will say it is a little tough to trust anything someone says who can t pronounce archimedes
whoa dude!
he s 80  at this point. probably the only reason she could do it  tbh
@joseph crabtree  the actor is. the character is only 70 . don t ask me why. it makes about as much sense as the movie existing at all.
pat roach also played hitler in last crusade
@ranko jankovic  no  in the last crusade he played a gestapo agent.  michael sheard played hitler in the last crusade.
to be fair  he s 70 in the movie  it s set in 1969 and indy was born in 1899 . harrison ford is essentially playing a character who s about a decade younger than his real age  he did the same in  kingdom of the crystal skull .
as someone who worked in assisted living i can say for certain that if you push a 80 year old down odds are they ll break something
the narrative shows this indy capable of  withstanding life.n death situation dodging death  facing danger.but a woman knocks him out  but not falling hard or hit with objects ...that s stupid writing
what happens if a young indy punch out a 80 years old woman
@corey levine  the  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!  from the w0ketards is gonna break the universe.
its actually kathleen kennedy that knocks out indiana jones in her dreams
first captain marvel hits an old lady and now this... lol
@corey levine  outrage
if it has that super strong-sounding indiana jones punching sound effect when she does it  it s going to be even more insulting.
maybe never seen it written down before
sword in the stone had the owl named archimedes  that s where i first heard it lol
it s even harder to believe she wouldn t take 10 seconds to figure it out before making this video. seems to speak to the credibility of this channel
to be fair  she mispronounces a lot of names. pretty sure  so-crates  was another one a while back. same thing with words like  ostensibly . sort of on brand for her really.
@mr. p  okay fair enough  i don t watch her enough to know that.
@mr. p  to be fair the way most people pronounce socrates isn t the way a greek would in the first place  but i feel your pain
i thought the same thing
archemeeds
as despicable as they are  harrison ford is quite willing to destroy his iconic characters han solo and indiana jones for a fat paycheck  which may be even more despicable.
what if vandalism is the point
@tj roelsma  don t forget blade runner 2049
i hope you re right  but  i m thinking this may just be the beginning...
@thomas k  blade runner 2049 is a flawed masterpiece. it s not fair to compare 2049 to contemptible rubbish like dial of destiny. the indiana jones franchise was broken before dial of destiny  temple of doom and  kingdom of the crystal skull were travesties. to be fair  harrison ford was never more than an a- actor at best  most of his perfomances were b  at best.
@time is our most valuable currency.  i wouldn t call 2049 anything close to a masterpiece  beautiful to look at but vapid  but we agree on most of the rest. ford was always far more charismatic than a  good actor . he was near perfect for solo jones decker in the old days but when his charisma wore off... well... you get the harrison of the last 30 years  a nostalgia shell.
classy
one sensible way to have navigated the end of indy would have been for harrison  as a condition for doing the role  to have demanded that he remain the central hero  but who expanded his operation into an ensemble  marion  mudd  perhaps a final son named henry indiana jones iii  and maybe pheobe . indy leads the team in one more film  and walks off into the sunset. after ford s passing  they do a new movie  with a fully grown henry as the new indy. simple  logical  organic  and protects the franchise.
kathleen kennedy is what happens when you put the coffee girl in power.
physical media anybody over 30 understands that or they should let these big companies do whatever we always have physical media and we don t have to watch or support the stuff that they produce. it s that simple.
@phillip harris  people don t value anything anymore.
terrible people like to destroy those that do better than they do.
the failure is female.
they may not kill him but they hand all his previous accomplishments to her. might as well kill him at that rate..
@jojo chavez  i still can t believe george lucas could have made such a devastating mistake
small hats are everywhere. sick and tired of them like much other groups.
@der magnus  walt disney didn t like them  and now they took over disney company for decades.
@der magnus everyone with excessive power in their hands can be dangerous. do you dislike the common people or only the powerful pieces in the globalization chess  don t need to cover your behind by saying the last part of your comment if that s the case.
@der magnus  you could just say you re anti-semitic.
@david jacobs  no proof of that.
@david jacobs the disney family is known to be christians. the disney s bosses nowadays are... not. lolalso  walt left the democratic party in 1940 to become a republican. and get this  in 1946  he was a founding member of the motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals  an organization who stated they  believ ed  in  and like  the american way of life  ...  we find ourselves in sharp revolt against a rising tide of communism  fascism and kindred beliefs  that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life.
shaw isn t a jewish surname so you re just whining incessantly for no reason.not that it d be wrong if the character was jewish.
@ redacted   christianity  communism  wokism  all conspiracies created by them.
@david jacobs  what about judaism and and islam  ha ha i joke.
@-siculus-hort-  those conspiracies sometimes worked too well and backfired on them.
@ redacted   think for yourself.
@david jacobs  correct. like cancer.
@dragon ball fans can t read  despising subversive scum is not being  anti  something  is having common sense and a notion of self-preservation.
for me  there is only the first and third.
agreed  this is the voice over we ve been waiting for!
what did leonard nimoy do  was his last role in fringe as the other world scientist  i thought that was pretty good.
@qtsssim  his last st roles were wasted in jj trek.
agree
i think it s the perfect trilogy  the crystal skull is maybe a  what if . i wouldn t watch disney s fan fic  if they paid me lol.
wow! she knocked him out when 3 very large men from the series failed to do so  well good for her!
larry the cable guy s joke  indiana jones and the search for more metamucil  sure sounds like the better movie right about now...
i ve pretty much given up on new movies at this point..it seems they are mostly race swapped remakes and or carrying a woke narrative..i love the old movies. thankfully i have a huge collection of such. spoil away mel.
indy has only 3 movies
they really should have just let him ride off into the sunset. that was the perfect ending for him.
...isn t that why we watch... would watch indiana jones  to watch him be strong  to watch him be brave  to watch him be attentive  to watch him be a man !  isn t that why we would watch indiana jones  i don t know who they re making this for now  honestly.  dead on. you nailed it  melonie. my respect for you for cutting through all the bs and telling the truth.
the dial of destiny  is also what kathleen kennedy calls her favorite vibrator.
if this is true there could def. have been an ending where you see helena doing everything indy was doing in raiders and temple of doom etc. setting her up to take indys place in times to come. and after all the backlash they went with this  punching out indy instead  ending.
i can t believe she was that annoying robot in the solo movie. she is that level of awful. intergalactically awful.
all new melonie mac video. love to see it. you look fantastic melonie
i don t mind the spoilers. i wasn t going to watch it anyway. the franchise is dead to me also the only thing worse than our favorite archeologist going onto a spaceship in indiana jones 4  is time travel. time travel is seriously overdone and it was stupid to even add this to indiana jones in the first place! great video today melonie  you look very beautiful today!
wouldn t it have been a much more compelling story if indy was actually happy  if he and his wife were in love and he was a good husband and father and his career was coming to an end in an honorable way. yet  even though he had everything an older man could want  there was still an itch in his soul to have one last adventure. that seems like it would be a much more interesting story because indy would have so much to lose. yet he goes on this last adventure because he felt duty-bound to save the people he loved. the audience would be cheering for him but scared for him at the same time cuz he would have so much to lose if he failed. every action sequence would actually have consequences for him. instead  kathleen kennedy and her man-hating sycophants want to destroy masculinity in order to propagate a woke agenda and they care little about destroying an iconic masculine hero.
i was ready to pile on this upcoming disaster of a movie but melonie s mispronunciation of archimedes  name kept me laughing. it reminded me of socrates in bill   ted and of penelope in club dread
i m pretty sure people have asked   why is she here  ever since phoebe came into this world.
it s almost like the old episode of south park  except instead of spielberg and lucas violating indy it s a bunch of woke strong empowered wahmen pegging him
loved the video but a part of me died during the archimedes segment
that a life size lara  it was a trilogy. and this was intentional as that woman has destroyed everything lucas created.
goal of disney was to ridicule indy  they ended with all the world laughing at them and honoring the character legacy  wich ended with the last crusade   exactely the perfect job that i expected from disney  well done guys  this is the right way to the abiss  keep going.
come on did we really think this was gonna be a good movie
crystal skull perfectly fits with temple of doom just as raiders fits with last crusade.
fate of atlantis and young indy are the only  what ifs   we don t talk about the cg monkey film.
it s all canon
this woke propaganda is going to put a naive woman on the ground one day
what s  my  name  say
that does sounds way better than what disney has prepared
i d watch a indiana jones bubba hotep
indiana jones and the seatch for high t as well
so far  tom cruise has been having a great track record lately  but he s the exception.
1989. yeah.
marrying marion was the perfect ending
@austin cha  i respect your opinion.
@david low  you too
@austin cha  thank you
for their own insecurity
read  my  name
no... say she named this movie after her favorite vibrator.  will come off funnier
intergalactically awful  .... nailed it
10 would really help your cause  man
i agree about the time travel narrative. especially when the story touches on real history  time travel doesn t work for me. miss mac looks beautiful indeed!
that story is too intelligent for hollywood.
she takes such good care of herself  so she ll probably never get type ii  diabeets.
ah  you too then! that was hard on me watching a millennial having no idea of who archimedes is
yeah the pronunciation was horrible
abyss  it s spelt abyss.
@milan ondrak  thanks for the correction  english is not my first language
@enrico nono  fair enough.
we all saw this coming from a thousand miles away
harrison ford could have said no to the part and hopefully protect the character  but that would require the actor to be a real man  one with integrity as i thought he had . also  there was already a problem with there being divorce papers in the plot to begin with. it continues to set the expectation that one can get out of marriage instead of working on together in a godly way. good that they reconciled  though  so i agree that there s a saving grace.
lol i am so triggered by the mispronunciation of the name of one of the most famous greeks in history. come on  melonie lmao sound like bill and ted when they say  socrates
i ve missed the mispronunciations  it s aar kuh mee deez  meloniehave a great day  melonie. you re very beautiful today
she knocks out indiana jones to save history. friggin awesome. it proves again for the umptieth time that these woke writers are empty shells without any original thought.
all i wanna see is someone do crazy sword techniques  and then the female do the same. and indy interrupts and shoots the guy. perfect throwback.
it ended at the last crusade for me ! with great wokeness comes great brokenness !
as parents  husband and i will be happily introducing our daughter and kids-to-come-along to indiana jones...the trilogy. there s only the 3 films after all.
so we can watch a 35 yr old woman ko an 80 yr old man....thats indiana jones now.....thats the best they could do
i was thinking of the map room scene in tanis where the sunlight passes through the headpiece. great moments like that are seriously missing in these new things.
indian jones is one of my favorite movie characters.  i won t be watching the new movie.  i ll keep my fond memories of the original trilogy.
the ending is disappointing because it ruins indy s growth and ability to make his own decision. it s baffling how they don t seem to get this  or else they just don t care.
melonie  archimedes is pronounced   ark-ih-me-deez   not   ark-ih-meedz .sorry  but this bugged me.
melonie  you kept saying archimedes name wrong. you know who he is. the famous ancient greek mathematician and inventor. we know it is him because the article that you read says the roman siege on syracuse which happened in ancient times. that being said  you analysis of the state of movies is spot on. it is cringe to the max. i love the point you made about how we do want to see a strong and competent indy.
how many movie franchises can kathleen kennedy ruin
indy deserved better for his final film.
so punching an 80 year old guy who happens to be the title character of the entire series is heroic
you are so awesome  love the videos. thanks for continually speaking out against this nonsense  and calling it out.
kathleen kennedy is griffinth in this reality
i ve decided i m just going to skip seeing any movie in theaters anymore.modern movies on a hole are so disappointing these days.
i wish i had a dial of destiny to go back in time to prevent kathleen kennedy
harrison ford let them do this treatment to han solo before this  so i guess he had to destroy another iconic character of his.
thank you for this. love melonie but that hurts my ears.
i d love for pwb to do the sword techniques and the  indy plugs her with  .45 caliber round.
there are 5
they made this instead of adapting fate of atlantis.
@zettabeam62  lord beer me strength  how is lucas film still a thing
indy  being born in 1899  would have been 70 years old in the movie. that does not make him a feeble old man. he was shown throughout the movie franchise that he could take a punch  let alone being knocked out cold.
disney seems to want a half ass attempt at started a new streaming line or new films.
archimedes  being an ancient greek  should have played by adele james.
she saved star wars
i mostly read books.there are some series and movies i watch but i mostly read books and i even write my own stories.  at least i try.there are so many old sci fi books out there that can last you for a lifetime.
i doubt she has the strength to knock out an 80 year old man and i m not joking lol
i can t get over how awesome you are  melonie! keep preaching the truth!
re  archimedes. why can t youtubers do a little research
hey melonie! hope you re having a great day so far. you re looking very pretty today
that sounds like an a.i. written plot...
can t believe that harrison ford would even get involved in the erasing of indiana jones for the disney joke agenda.
melonie is not mary sue  i know she can and has made mistakes. but man  she can get up and beam sunshine through the internet better than ever. go boom!
archimede trying to escape syracuse  he was so taken by his studies he pretty much didn t even acknowledge the whole siege! he was even killed when he absent-mindedly told a roman soldier to not bother his circles.  was doing geometry
i blame harrison ford.
aw  she doesn t know who archimedes is. that s so cute. and i guess they re totally writing off his son from the last movie
it s over! and it s so incredibly sad...
soon as i saw the notification for melonies video i instantly tapped it
i ve literally been waiting for them to do this  we knew it was going to happen at some point. i just started playing the oregon trail remake on the switch and it s hilarious  they have a woman carpenter in the group at the start of the game. we all know that was not a thing  women did woman things back then and men did men things. they re trying to rewrite history through all the mediums and it s infuriating. the new generation is being brought up on lies.
indy fans are about to find out what gamergate  comicsgate  and starwarsgate were really about.indy is about to get luke skywalkered into oblivion.we just wanted to see one last yeehaw and watch him ride off into the sunset one last and pass the torch forward  not to see indy humiliated over and over by an angry bitter feminist cat lady.
it s weird that hollywood keeps casting these woke female comedians to replace the all time greats
so they basically did to indy what they did to luke  by continuing kk s own feminist narrative on men as disposable utilities  and secondary to women. that s definitely a message to send to the majority male viewers  that they re going to appreciate as much as a severe rug burn.must be annoying the hell out of her  that she had to go as high up in age as an 80 y o man  before she could present that delusion as even remotely sane or realistic.
not so brave  not so strong  not so attentive  not so much indiana jones.
fyi  archimedes was an ancient greek mathematician and the siege of syracuse happened in the 2nd century  213ad   and so he had absolutely nothing to do with wwii or supporting the germans. he actually has an interesting history and may have been the first person to develop a directed energy weapon using mirrors in a parabolic array to focus sunlight to blind  or maybe even ignite  enemy ships  basically  focusing sunlight like a kid with a magnifying glass burning bugs .
i hope we get at least five more indy movies after the success of this one!
archimedes  pronounced are-come-e-de s  of syracuse was a greek mathematician  physicist  engineer  astronomer  and inventor from the ancient city of syracuse in sicily. sorry i love ancient history and the indiana jones trilogy!
besides  indy  being born in 1899  would have been only 70 years old in the movie.
she usually doesn t read the article before she films. honest reactions. means she has to make multiple videos sometimes if she doesn t like the first one.
most actors don t care about the characters they portray  there are there for a paycheck to  act .
no he is old and lost his sense of judgement. he actually really loves his character indy. i can only blame disney 90
it ended in 1989.
one of the more irritating aspects of that is female characters who sleep around like a man in period pieces.    pre 1960 sales of the pill women were terrified of getting pregnant.
luke in the sequels was perfect in every way
clearly she doesn t want my money  that s fine she s not getting any of mine.
@franchise fanatic  he wasn t even a shell of himself  just a neutered wreck  courtesy of the psychotic feminists in hollyweird.
3rd century bc  213-212 bc
best comment   very respectful
hey owning this huge ip expect new trilogies  spin offs and shequels
might want to read up on who archimedes is before you make a video dunking on a movie that involves his character...
i think it s deliberate. once upon a time  being the ip holder gave absolute power over a franchise. that day is done. if the ip holder insists on not bringing out new content or bringing out garbage content  we can now make our own. i invite all my fellow star wars fans to enjoy another unauthorized novel completely free. just google legend of the harp jedi.
that is a nice lara croft statue.
melonie  i have to ask. is there some kind of an audio problem with your videos  they are about 20-30  quieter than most videos on youtube. i always have to really crank up my volume to hear you
no  archimedes  ark-a-meed-ees  was a famous ancient greek engineer and mathematician who lived in the greek colony of syracuse on the island of sicily. he was rumored to have made a weapon that helped to repel the roman invaders.
sure  they can say she punched him out to  save history   but they did it mostly to make a man miserable in reality and not do some good with his skillset.
they ran into ark-a-meeds and the whole nine yards !
they don t teach kids about archimedes anymore  anyway   the antikythera device is older than that.
harrison ford long ago said he ll do anything for the right money
indiana jones and the dial--  wait what   i don t know what are you talking about melonie  there s only 3 indiana jones movie. it was a nice trilogy from the 80s. thats it.
of course they would have indy divorced or on the brink of divorce. he can t be just dead beat dad. he has to keep up standards set by bladerunner and star wars tfa.
so she beats up a 80  years old guy ! wtf ! what s next  punshing children  timetraveling to punsh minor indiana jones and german children  to prevent ww2  imo it would be a hilariously funny story. could be the next movies. time travel and punshing villans throughout history before they grow up to try to prevent bad things from happening. plot twist  what she does could be the reason  why they become villans. time travel makes so much interesting stories possible
love your stuff but your pronunciation of  ark-i-mead-ees  hurts my soul
she knocks out indie  then shoots herself in the face to save humanity.
indiana jones and the punching of the patriarchy.
the thing is. apart from 2  though technically from a storyline perspective 0  there have always been strong female characters in the films. the difference is they don t make him or any character weaker. which is the problem that modern films have nowadays. strong female characters are as valid as any character as long as they make sense and don t detract or dilute other characters to get there. look at ripley or princess leia  original trilogy  for examples.
yay stuff in the background!! glad to see lara back in some way. anyway  skipping it it. sounds like a dumpster fire. i ve been let down by lucas film too many times in the last decade to even bother giving this a try.
senior abuse is a legitimate issue and this movie apparently glorifies senior abuse in order to get an old person to listen to the  wisdom  of  youth  seems problematic and triggering
say what you will about crystal skull at least indy got a happy ending.
it s sad they even made another movie simply because he s way too old to be the indy we want to see.  but to do this this is even worse.  by the way  it s not so easy for a normal man to knock out another man   though it seems to happen in movies all the time  so a woman doing so is doubly ridiculous.
she couldn t knock her way out of a wet paper bag
thanks for sharing the spoilers  now i don t need to search for them out of curiosity for a movie i won t see.
harrison ford is probably my favorite actor but it is always disappointing to think he doesn t like han solo. in the first two movies he was the most interesting for me as a child. he doesn t have a whole lot to do in jedi but ford should have more respect for the role that made him a star.
his name is pronounced   arc a mee dees  a very  important ancient greek inventor from history
digging up the withered corpse of a timeless character to make  or in this case lose a quick buck meanwhile shoveling your politics down our throats  who is making these decisions  what is going on here  did we jump to some kind of alternate reality where up is down and men are women   oh wait...
i can t wait to go see it on opening night!  and after that i ll swing by target and pick up some bud light
indiana jones ended at the last crusade. change my mind.
we just wanted to see one last yeehaw and watch him ride off into the sunset one last and pass the torch forward  not to see indy humiliated over and over by an angry bitter feminist cat lady.
actually  outside of combat with actual enemies who want him dead  fleabag punching him is just elder abuse ffs.
it s probably lara croft s hand.
hopefully you googled archimedes after this  lol. i m 50 years old and beaten down by a system i cannot fight. i was hoping indy would be able to one last time  but it s 2023.
kwasade against the algorithm !!!
just when you think you have enough reasons to avoid this movie like the plague  they keep piling on even more!
if only reddit hadn t of had a collective hissy fit about kingdom of the crystal skull and the star wars prequels  and made george lucas give up and sell them to disney. now look what we have. great job  guys.
tom cruise is officially the last true movie star  looking forward to mi7 pt1.
at this point  i hope she makes it through this review instead of . it s contagious
indiana jones had his vulnerabilities  one being scared of snakes  like a lot of people  but i bet this  new  female character  mary sue  won t have any whatsoever because of the  woke message
so he let them destroy both han solo  and the legendary indiana jones....thanks harrison
what a sad day for indiana jones fans  the movies ended on the last crusade. the one i enjoyed watching with my grandpa. beyond that is the great unknown.
archimeeds ....that s like bill and ted with  socraits
can t. won t. you said nothing wrong.
holy!!!!  thats the new 6th ending they had to do an emergency reshoot...its still crap!  the story would be decent if fleabag s character was erased!  it would be better if indy was introduced to a his new infant god-daughter...lara.
the only woman that should outshine indiana jones is lara croft
i swear man  these woke writers get under some woke spell once they get going and can t break outta that. it just snowballs  this sounds utterly ridiculous
the reconciliation at the end is a great idea  but indiana isn t the one making the choice. it s robbing him of even that much agency. also  i think it s high time we start referring to mary sue characters as what they really are  benevolent misogyny.
archemedeeees
a cameo of shoeonhead in your video  you two are some of my favorite female youtubers! you should do a collaboration video! as for hijacking the the video with tomb raider you can do that in every in every video  i love to listen to you talking about tomb raider  it s certainly more entertaining than what they ve been doing with the franchise.
don t ever say  peak cringe  because it will be taken as a challenge.
can t wait til  labyrinth gets the  modern audience  treatment
indiana jones and the dunce of diversity does seem appealing to any fan of the originals.their hubris is astounding.
pronounce archimedes correctly. archimedes is considered one of the most intelligent men women in history up their with einstein maybe even smarter
deep breath ...archimeeds !
oh my word  please go read up on archimedes. he is like one of the greatest thinkers of his era.
it s ark-a-me-dees and he was the da vinci of the ancient world.
everything disney does from remakes to sequels is all about  passing the old white-man torch to a new era of social inclusivity where the white man is the villian.  when you realize that  then everything they do becomes apparent. they did it with star wars  willow  marvel comics  little mermaid and the other classic cartoon remakes  and now this. fleabag is indiana jones now  and if sir cock of doom is correct  she also erases and replaces the original indy through time by going through his adventures in his place.
indy  getting ruined by the woke run lara  ruun! and ironically we have indy devs making our lara games.
i am spending my money on teenage kraken that weekend. not to nitpick it s arch e me dees
more and more this stuff comes out  the more happy i am that i own an rtx4090. means i can sit here  mod my old quality games like skyrim for example. you know. and just forgot about modern entertainment. which is all about messages  wokeness and agendas.
this movie is elder abuse!
well to be fair indy is 80 years old i m pretty sure a 15 year old could knock him out at that point. but had it been indy in his prime he d have shrugged it off like it was nothing.
i always find it ironic that harrison ford hated playing han solo because he didn t want to be typecast yet keeps coming back to indiana jones.
say goodbye to the bowie bulge.
that will be a dark day
you re new here. she s always mispronouncing things. it s part of her charm.
indy  being born in 1899  would have been 70 years old in the movie. i m 69  not half the man indy was  and believe i would not get knocked out cold by a 130 lb woman.
i could believe her being able to knock out a 80 year old man  but a 25 year indiana jones would knock her out after in a heart beat.
nothing to do with women or phoebe waller. it s to do with using a 100 year old actor  whose salary alone would funds 1000 s of original movie scripts   crappy cgi and a corporate disney studio trying to milk a franchise to death. what did you expect blaming a women actor is like blaming a women on the titanic for the iceberg that is about to hit it. the indiana jones 5 whole enterprise was a disaster from the get-go. it s very popular to mindlessly blame everything on  woke  culture  idiots use it as if it applies to everything. if there is a hint of a  women in a shitty movie  it is has become part of popular culture to use the term woke  as if it provides the  critic  with some intellectual credentials. and why aren t these so called  critics  pointing us to better original movies instead of obsessing with big budget block busters  they are also part of the problem.millions of crappy movies have been made across history without being woke. the audience who wants to see remakes  sequels upon sequels and prequels is to blame for watching stale rehashed movies instead of demanding and supporting original scripts and character and studios. as an audience if you behave like a mindless consuming capitalist bot who consumes everything they are fed  they capitalist studios will feed you crap  this is nothing new  anyone watched the transformer series
people said crystal skull was worst movie   hellwood is like hold my bud light!!!
nothing to live for   he literally married marion in the last film and has a son. i know people don t like crystal skull  but is disney just ignoring it
the last crusade should have been the final movie. would have been an amazing trilogy wrapped up with a satisfying and dignified ending.
melanie mac goes standup
it s disappointing that they keep making these characters come back and not want to be who they are--luke skywalker  now this.what if people showed up for the next mario bros movie and they no longer wanted to jump through pipes or ride in karts but they only do this once the character gets old  like they dislike older men. the actual actor is still charmimg and has plenty of strength and personality  yet they make the character some guy who s different and hates himself. that s fine if the character always hated themselves  but it will be a character that was happy and now they don t want to be around.if the hero of the movie doesn t want to save the day  then you have no movie. i can understand a hero being reluctant because the threat is too big or something like that  but these characters that they bring back don t want to save the day anymore because they suddenly hate themselves or people in general. it doesn t make for a fun experience.i see guys older than me everyday that might be tired or even jaded at work  but they still take what they have to do seriously. and if someone younger than them tries to take it as a joke  they ll quickly set them straight. meanwhile all these movie heroes have to be told and convinced by younger people all the time to do their jobs. so silly.
made me smile every time melonie mispronounced archimedes.
so sad that both tina turner and indiana jones died on the same day.
what s next  minnie knocks out mickey and assumes his position as the new face of disney
way here chance it for  a man  2 a women it won  be  the sim i love the original  video thanks for the video i love it have a good day and night
if they wanted a good female character they should have gotten someone like julia schlaepfer  who played alexandra in 1923.  she played a hell of a character and lots of fun.
the last decade and probably the next are a dark age of movie and tv the vast majority is unwatchable  fortunately there is a wealth of classic movies and tv shows from the previous four decades to watch again and again  battlestar galactica grimm etc plus the odd great contemporary show like the expanse.
this is why people walk away from disney because of the garbage they keep producing
just rewatched the last crusade.  which is the third and final indiana jones film. we used to have nice things
i can buy a disheartened indy being devastated by mutt s death in vietnam  or so i ve heard   which would indeed put stress on his and marion s relationship  but in no way will i accept a cowardly indiana jones. the man literally walked off a cliff in last crusade  he freakin  cut a rope bridge dangling some 200ft over a river  and so many more!! cowardly is not a term that defines indy. frankly  given shia s departure from movies  mutt s death would have actually been a very relatable tragedy and an acceptable decision for character conflict.
harrison should.have taken one look at the script and bailed on this. why he wanted to help.destroy indiana is beyond meedit  why is the phoebe chick even in movies at all  no offense but disney lost all track of what movies should be
bud light boycott
lara surviving tibet in shorts and a bomber jacket with zero complaints proved she was a superhuman just like mario. but being a female  she wasn t allowed to stay that way
mutt supposedly died.
wait  you don t know who archimedes is
i paused the video where you gave us a spoiler warning just to say spoil away. this looks like a movie i will be avoiding anyway so show us the rubbish that makes it worse than the crystal skull. worse than the crystal skull  now those are words i never thought i d be connecting with an indiana jones movie.what has happened to cinema  there used to be a ballanced approach to characters where men and women were both able to be strong protagonists. these days all the films bar a very select few seem to be sexist in favour of women. there is no longer ballance  there is only feminism fighting a war against men because now women have achieved equality in most countries around the world they still aren t happy. they want to control men and tip the scales away from equality to a matriarchy. this film will bomb. very few will watch it and kathleen kennedy will find another ip to kill with her political message. i d have sacked kathleen kennedy after the last jedi so she couldn t do any more damage but that s just me.these days i m hoping disney doesn t sack kathleen kennedy because their blindness to her incompetence deserves to cause the collapse of the company.
this is how i felt when the second jurassic world film destroyed isla nublar via the  volcano . felt my childhood go up in flames with the dinosaurs they didn t get off the island. i don t understand why do this. they can t create  just destroy what better hands crafted.
we already have a female indiana jones  she is called lara croft!
when the whole woke thing blows over  is phoebe waller-bridge going to have a career  it wouldn t shock me if she s known only for playing insufferable characters in awful films and will regret having so irretrievably bet the farm on a cultural fad.
it s arca me dees ! please say you went to high school and studied history
the fact that you can t pronounce archimedes  a historically famous greek mathematician  tells me everything i need to know about your bandwagon jumping review lmao
ark-ah-me-dees my dear
the big german from raiders punched indy in the face several times and didn t knock him out  but helena hits him once and out he goes  yeah  whatever...
harrison ford literally had his legacy ruined by disney  twice.
in raiders of the lost ark  indiana jones was not knocked unconscious when a 7 foot tall  300 pound nazi punched him in the face.  so phoebe waller bridge s character must pack one hell of a punch if she can ko indy.  wait a minute!  i forgot this is a kathleen kennedy production where the women always punch harder  run faster  think smarter  and fight better than the men.  so of course helena can knockout indy with one punch.... even though she is much shorter  skinnier and lighter than him
wow.....archimeeds lol hahaha
fun fact. project archimedes was the codename for the batman  arkham series.  s
why are you surprised they dragging indiana jones you saw what they did han solo made him a dead beat failureand made luke a coward who raised a light saber to his best friend and sisters son....she hated this lore anything lucas and spielberg
why would i want to watch an indiana jones movie where indiana jones is portrayed as idiotic and incompetent  and he s portrayed that way solely to prop up a much less interesting  strong wamyn  insert
punching an old man for not doing what you tell him to do so stunning. so brave.
if they brought back the student that had  love you  on her eyelids...her eyelids would now say  woke af
rip indiana jones.thanks for the memories.
damn that arcameads
aside from phoebe s unnecessary character  this is just another case of time travel ruining everything. indiana jones never needed a time travel story.
han in the sequels was perfect
in the deleted scenes  she falsely accuses him.
mads mikkelson is good at playing villains  i thought he did great as grindelwald. this may be over if those films that s gonna come back to haunt him! btw i m here through valliant renegade and wdw pro
r-ka-meed-ees  no hate just correct pronunciation.
i ve lost so much respect for harrison ford.  after he made me laugh out loud in anchorman 2 with his suprise cameo  i kinda forgave him for that pitiful star war venture.  now  i just realized that he s absolutely deranged and his legacy is essentially laughed at my men and women now.   he probably trying to make up for his womanizing days during the 70-90s.  get over it pal.
do they not teach reading in school anymore
didn t they re-write and re-shoot the ending like...3 different times  so  how bad were the previous versions we won t see
if marion could not knock out indy in one punch  enough said i think.
ffs  i was on board until you couldn t read archimedes correctly
not even two hulking masses of men in raiders and temple of doom could knock indy unconscious lmao
please learn how to pronounce that name. one of the most famous people in earth s history and you re not saying his name correctly. i like ur videos. we agree on a ton of stuff. i love the channel too.but if you aren t at least willing to google how to pronounce the name archimedes then please don t make the video. sorry
i believe hitting and knocking out indy should be considered elder abuse  or am i wrong   so lame
so basically the film is a stand in -- phoebe waller bridge is kathalen kennedy   indy is george lucas  -- sad  old and inatentive  his  franchises and life  taken over by the  perfect  kathleen  then run into the ground in some sort of revenge
melanie  really  ...archimedes doesn t ring a bell  at all
nice set up! are you standing  love ya  melonie!
melonie did you ask if archimedes  was a hitler supporter  did you not take a history or math class in high school  archimedes was a ancient greek philosopher who lived 2000 years before hitler.
it sounds like the indiana jones baton is being passed on to a new generation. i don t believe a word of it but i do believe harrison ford wanted out ofthe franchise in the same way he wanted out of star wars because he loathed both han solo and indiana jones at the end up!
ms. melonie mac ! my sister enjoys tomb raider almost as much as you do lol. she has a shelf of collectibles of laura croft. i d love to show you a picture to see if her collection is up to ms. mac standards !
time travel in indiana jones
you know what  if people don t care to get spoiled about an upcoming major movie  this is proof that it s really really bad. i m not gonna watch it  even though i was a biiiig fan of this franchise.
even at 80 she couldn t stop him.
the only real entertainment value any of these  modern   woke additions to old classics provide  is the mockery and ridicule they deservedly get along with their utter failure on all levels.
indy  being born in 1899  would have been 70 years old in the movie.
my indians jones ended with the last crusade   and it ended perfectly. this new stuff just sounds like a steaming pile.
there is no franchise they won t try and ruin.  lara croft  star wars  james bond  now indy to name a few.
not all heroes wear capes. some risk prosecution to leak spoilers from awful films so film-goes can save money.
say after me- ah-car-mee-deez
hearing the plot of this movie all i can think is  didn t we already get this movie years ago and wasn t it called back to the future iii
hello archimedes has nothing to do with hitler.....qoute from wikipedia  archimedes of syracuse      rk  mi di z   3  a  c. 287   c. 212 bc  was a greek mathematician  physicist  engineer  astronomer  and inventor from the ancient city of syracuse in sicily. 4  although few details of his life are known  he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. considered the greatest mathematician of ancient history  and one of the greatest of all time  5  archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems. 6  7  these include the area of a circle  the surface area and volume of a sphere  the area of an ellipse  the area under a parabola  the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution  the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution  and the area of a spiral. 8  9
honestly anyone who s interested in watching indiana jones 5 probably need a straight jacket
the woman has to be the smarter  wiser and stronger one in the story.  makes sense if you like watching indy reduced to a frail old man.
let me guess  indie dies and his trans  mixed race  daughter does everything a million times better than him.  yeah  im not falling for that again
ford is also responsible for allowing this  so he along the others  are complicit and just take the paycheck
eureka ! i m speechless.........
laura croft was loved by millions of male fans  so she had to be ruined in order to strike down males everywhere.the big question for me...why did harrison even bother to make this new indy movie
i saw the title and just had to say that the reason why that woman is there is because she is now the main character. they are going to pull the same crap they did with bo-katan in the mandalorian. wasn t din djarin s show anymore but hers.
ar-ka-mee-dees. good god
wait.  archimedes needs a modern watch to understand complex ancient tech   dear writers  you obviously understand little about technology  engineering  or history--but as a writer  do you understand  anachronism    you have one i would expect only a ten-year old to make.  reading some wikipedia would have prevented this--no degree required.   knocking out an old man  i could believe if she s done a lil boxing.  it s effed up and immoral  but--that s how disney rolls.
repeat after me  ark-uh-me-deez. thank you.
indy   how did you end up like this helena   what smart  independent beautiful  self sufficient indy  no..delusional
fyi  archimedes who s named your slightly mispronouncing. was a greek mathematician  engineer  astronomer and inventor  from the island of sicily. keep making the great videos mel and good luck.
archimedes is pronounced ark-ah meed-eaze
i ve heard of melonie mac before but i thought she was just one of those twitch gamer girls. i didn t know she did yt and was one of us   subscribed
star wars was not ruined
just sit back  don t go see it and enjoy the fact that  when enough fans reject this garbage  the result will be disney losing another 150-200 million dollars based on the budget assumption. we ll smother it very quickly and it won t cost any of us a dime.
i m surprised they had marion be the one doing the grocery shopping. because that s  misogynist .
i feel i m qualified to say there are only three indiana jones movies.  it s also ridiculous to shoehorn a woman into the series when lara croft exists and is also awesome  if they let her be .
arkameeds
disrespecting indiana jones in his own movie is the ultimate insult.
when i hear a name like phyllis burpington-wombley  it automatically translates to  insufferable pain in the ass.  you don t need to see this movie or even hear about it to know it s bad.
i actually applaud you for spoilers i have no interest in seeing this besides the trailers do that anyway
this ending would work if indiana stayed in the past. cut to a scene of some roman ruins being excavated. two archaeologists clearing a wall engraving step back and say who is this  show the wall glyph with indiana in roman centurion officer clothing looking happy with a family etched into the wall. it seems fitting to let him become part of the history he loved so much if everything else is gone
hearing this i can see how people at the can film festival we re board watching this movie
you know  ..this is the  lesser  of two evils  if this is legit  i ll take it. as long as indy isn t getting erased and replaced by phoebe.
arc-a-mee-deees
indiana jones is a human character. he doesn t have supernatural abilities. indiana jones is older. indiana jones has aged. indiana jones has lived life. indiana jones is a human. i believe that s what they are trying to depict in this movie.
i love the way melonie says archimedes.
archimedes-  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki archimedesthe whole movie is a waste.  i don t have any desire to deal with this ridiculous shit.disney is dead.
melonie  it comes to no surprise to what is in store for indy 5. the franchise should have ended back in 1989 with the last crusade with indy  his dad  sallah  and marcus riding on their horses into the sunset  you can t possibly top that. this whole woke thing is getting on everybody s nerve  mine included but thankfully there is a silver lining  according to endymion  the woke era is dying  https   m.youtube.com watch v kc0nrmwvlnc pp yguoug9zdcb3b2tligv0ahk 3din time  it will come to an end and hollywood will have no choice but to adapt or die  i hope it s the latter because we are also starting to see that the independent film industry is thriving and producing better content than hollywood. anyway  you re very entertaining!  i look forward to seeing more of your videos! you just earned a new subscriber and friend!
harrison ford should never have agreed to this mess.
even in crystal skull  jones always gets a beatdown from stronger jacked men and he walks it off  but waller bridge s knocks him out with one hit  pathetic
wow. who comes up with these ideas   they could have brought back marion  short round  mutt  gone to atlantis   and have the nest movie since raiders!  good lord!
ar-kih-mee-dees!
anything beyond last crusade is considered fan-fiction to me...and not the kind that is guilty pleasure good kind.
you know a franchise is dead if they introduce space and time travel.
dial of destiny  sounds more like a relic hunter title than something indiana jones.  melonie  if you haven t seen rh  you should give it a try.  it s right up your alley.
i think we might be missing a big part of the picture   harrison ford has been writing himself into his iconic characters - a sad  broken down old man.
yknow we should just bet money on how  man bad  each modern hollywood movies is.. and donate it all to men s health orgs.. we might as well get something out of this bs
i want to know why harrison ford was so complacent in the destruction of his character s  credibility
indiana jones and the dial of mary sue...
fubar is surprisingly entertaining.
sadly  if you want to  continue  ips from 30-40 years ago you have two options. recast the hero  doctor who anyone  or go animated  hello clone wars . however  both of those options require three things.  first  give the fans what they want  spiderman no way home  d d honor among thieves.  second  have good writing. it s that simple. lastly  don t attack your fanbase. before any of the star wars or marvel d  garbage came out there were  stories  about isms and phobes attacking the shows. which caused fans to wait for people they trusted to watch it and review it. before d d honor among thieves came out hasbro tried to steal the rights to anything created under the ogl  before that i was looking forward to honor among thieves. after that i waited until it went to a streaming service i was already paying for to watch it.
arky-meeds...ffs. archimedes  as in the famous greek mathematician.
hey  melonie i just wanted to say that i like your gray or black tank shirt that you got on for today and your curly hair looks great too. also i have to say that i don t think that i will ever see this new movie ever bc how it was so much boring and dumb that i would hate to spend my money on this boring movie instead of seeing a great action packed movie like fast and furious 10 in theaters. plus i think that harrison ford would be killed off in this movie and will not be returning back for any more movies series like this in future  ok melonie. anyway that is all i have to say about this topic of the video for today. hope you are having a great week this week and hope you are had a great day today and hope you enjoy your evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great week and have a great weekend too melonie. god bless you and god loves you too.
melonie at the beginning you stood with your hands on your hip s   nice   but do you think in the same pose you could try to touch your elbows behind your back .. i think it could be fun for us all to see
there s no way in hell that the average woman could ever have the upper body strength to punch a man with any appreciable amount of force  much less knocking him unconscious.
they wanna pass the torch to someone else to start a new series of movies  fine. they want it to be a woman  fine. but why does this torch passing stuff always have to deconstruct the original character  why can t it ever be a respectful hand off
archimedes was philosopher
the thing ive learned lately is... just dont bother enjoy anything or getting invested. these whack jobs will 100  ruin it on a long enough time line. so many of my favorite franchises have been utterly butchered in recent years. its so freaking tiresome.
did she just ask if archimedes  pronounced arc-a-me-dees  was a hitler stan at 4 22  lmao! nah bro he s ancient greek mathematician
i d love to go back and tell myself that  the crystal skulls  isn t as bad as it can get. i think my past self would wonder what kind of hell scape we are living in.
take a moment and realize that kk decided to end the climax of the last indiana jones movie with our beloved hero getting knocked out by a woman. if that isnt peak current year  i dont know what is.. screw disney and their destruction of our heroes
omgosh  this movie makes my stomach hurt without even watching it yet
challenge  don t mention lara croft in a videomelonie difficulty level  impossiblei joke. i actually really like you mentioning tomb raider whenever you get the chance tbh. it just shows you really love that specific franchise character  and it is a part of who you are. if more people like you show how to aggressively hold the line against these woke freaks  the fight against them gets easier.
cash.
go boom
i have to say  i m not sure i agree that phemenist waller bridge couldn t  punch out  eighty -ana jones. it s a maybe.... harrison was a great actor and can still do parts fit for his age  but he s old. you gotta be real. that indiana fan fiction he did 10 plus years ago strained my suspension of disbelief when he weathered a nuclear blast in a refrigerator...
a better story for a fourth indiana jones movie would have been  the spear of destiny. because that was an actual relic. the spear that pierced our lord jesus. said to have been held by napolean bonaparte when he tried to conquer the world  and hiltler sought it too. they would have had to recast indiana jones at this point  but i m not one of those   it can only be harrison ford  people... it just needs to be someone who looks the part and can act the role. harrison  is too old for a new adventure of any merit.
how many times will melonie laugh under her breath this video   under a hundred
illinois james and the message of feminism
god bless you melonie from a brother in christ
he s not really a protagonist in the normal sense. he s an anti-hero. it wasn t strong and brave and courageous when he dated marion when she was 15   he was twelve years older. the guy  literally  digs up graves as a side hustle. people need to question who they re looking up to.
rey hit luke from the back in the last jedi. getting tired of women pulling off cowardly moves towards our heroes.
well  that s the final nail in the coffin of this franchise tbh.first indy is seen as a withering old man who is haunted by memories of the good old days  his god daughter treats him like utter trash and now she punches him and knocks him out.another feminist wet dream and another dead franchise  well done disney may you burn in hell.
she might as well kick him in the sack for further humiliation  that is after all what this movie is all about.
let s give indiana jones one last hurrah!  then insert the wokest feminist we can find to show him how it should have been done all along.  it will be fine.  what could possibly go wrong
if they tried to swap out lara croft tomb raider for a literal male version of the same character but with none of the character traits that you like but still in the same outfit  in the games or movies or a tv show there would be out cry of misogyny or not letting a woman do her thing.
time to emasculate another character
wow  how heroic. psychically assaulting an old man. but then again i m not surprised. they need to emasculate indy so fleabag can be strong. i bet she s going to steal his legacy and make some cock and bull story about how she s going to  do better  then indy and do some protect artifact shit. i don t mind if you talk about tr mel. in fact indy inspired tr in a way. still i have no idea why these people hate the adventure genre some much.
aar-kuh-mee-deez. or arc-ah-meaties. please don t say his name like arcmeedes or whatever again that hurt to hear.
wonder if spielberg and lucas regret recommended giving the reigns of lucasfilms to kk. the fall of lucasfilms is epic how-not-to-handle-established-ip
this is such a shame! this movie should ve ended indiana jones legacy properly and 3rd act should ve had us crying our eyes out but in a good way  not randomly handing the torch to some random annoying feminist at the end while she constantly belittles indiana. this is literally common sense. same for rise of skywalker  the ending should ve been super emotional and have everyone crying at the end in a good way  cuz its a 40  year saga actually ending  not super cringe with having rey randomly hi-jacking the skywalker name and in the dumbest way possible  like some random hobo asking her her first and last name. wtf  what type of stranger ask for a last name  so forced and random.
they just couldn t stop at crystal skull. kathleen kennedy had to self insert again and destroy another franchise
gotta be honest. none of this sounds bad. indy getting ko d by a woman is very in character. i m imagining her deckinghim then jumping around cradling her hand and trying not to yell in pain. if she isn t a mary sue who scolds him for the whole movie then this plot break down sounds pretty good. i mean  i didn t hear anything about aliens... or shia lebeouf.
indiana jones can walk off a nuclear blast.  a punch from a 130 lb woman should barely register.
i won so much money when i bet on time travel and nazis.
they should ve let indy go with some modicum of dignity after the failure of crystal skull. heck  they could ve even done some young adult indy adventures leading up to raiders. this constant need to have obnoxious female characters take over male led franchises is becoming tiresome.i suspect ford took the role because he enjoys playing the character and just wasn t chuffed with the story. might explain why he apparently seems so bored.
it is insulting to the legacy and it is insulting to the newbie.  it implies the newbie can t measure up unless the measurement is lowered.
thing is  we all want cool  badass female characters but why does everything have to become about them and how great they are. specially when its not supposed to be about them. like the whole thing is just to stroke the ego of the cringe brigade. we must shit on men and masculinity to make it all about us. urgh. it fails every damn time. people arnt stupid they see it exactly for what it is. i just dont understand why its still happening.
i wasn t going to see it anyway. sad  i had a great story to end it with out making hf look ridiculous and bringing a heart warming way to end the franchise
it sounded terrible straight from the name. i mean   dial of destiny   i ll pass.
yikes.. aside from them bringing back marion..i hate saying it.. this sounds just    ing awful.. despite it s many many faults..i at least loved the ending to crystal skull.. it was a happy ending for indy with the love of his life.. having a son.. having life give him more than it had taken away...
to think that harrison ford could spend a life in hollywood without being part of the necropolis is naive.  of  course he s one of them.   never touch idols as the gilt rubs off.  guy de maupassant.
love the videos! look up archimedes pronunciation.
we got a great trilogy with a couple fan fiction projects
pronounced ark-ah-me-dees. he was an ancient genius and not affiliated with germans.  if that is the device i am thinking of  he invented it. it isn t really for time travel. most believe it is a kind of calendar. the movie sounds bad
its called growing old  we all get there and nothing stays the same  get used to change or live in a bubble to be honest. that being said  if they wanted to continue the franchise  they should have recast the role or ended it as they re doing now. as with marvel  i ve since opted out after endgame  its not for me anymore and depending on the new tomb raider  it may no longer be for me as well. i accept change but it doesn t mean i have to like it.
i was told that when writing you never want the main hero to be outdone or overshadowed by any other character.  also you don t want any character to be overpowered. it s considered bad writing.
i am one minute in.  will there be time travel
saw you on wdw pro.  highly underrated channel  best straight information on your entertainment news.
ark-a-mee-deez
archimedes was a real historical figure. he was a mathematician  astronomer  scientist  etc. from classical antiquity. died way before  you know who  came to power in the 1930 s.
archimedes  c. 287   c. 212 bc  was a greek mathematician  physicist  engineer  astronomer  and inventor from the ancient city of syracuse in sicily. 4  although few details of his life are known  he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. considered the greatest mathematician of ancient history  and one of the greatest of all time  5  archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems. 6  7  these include the area of a circle  the surface area and volume of a sphere  the area of an ellipse  the area under a parabola  the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution  the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution  and the area of a spiral. 8  9
does nicholas cage appear in a superman cameo
i ll actually concede that a woman could ko an 80-year-old indiana jones.i just.... don t see it as any kind of moral or heroic action. that could actually kill him.symbolically  however  i see the cultural vandalism exactly for what it is  and i despise them for doing it.
@ville billie  yeah  true. i forgot that the character is actually younger than harrison ford.
sounds like a bs plot leak to me.
why didn t they do this w chris pratt. imagine him as indy. he is everything the old indy was and more.
knocking out an octogenarian is pretty much going to kill him
and not one person is surprised at this point.
well the historical part of syracuse actually makes sense. archimedes was there and was killed there
hello melonie
wish we could go back in time and show george lucas the tragedies that awaited lucasfilm s best ips
it s greek  so it s pronounced ark-eh-mede-ees  i think.  he s one of the founders of modern science  but he lived in ancient greece  so it s pretty unlikely he d have any opinion on hitler who wouldn t be born for quite a while.  this story is somewhat less intelligent than the episodes of aladdin the animated series that starred mechanicles as the villain of the week.  ah  disney would never make a show like that today!
great ... a beautiful woman  but also smart  down to earth !!!
dial of destiny is a really dumb name btw. i like kingdom of the crystal skull better.
i ll wait to see how it s all done on film to make up my mind.  i agree that some of this doesn t sound right -- certainly not for the character we ve come to know -- but  sigh  what s hollywood to do   these days  they can t create anything new -- certainly not if it involves a confident male character -- so they re left with picking up old school creations and then destroying their legacy by having the young turks of today s cinema show them  cough cough  precisely how it s done.  it s sad  yes  and no one -- but no one -- wants to see a grandfatherly much less a great-grandfatherly indiana jones.  no one.
i think you ladies are going to have to register for the draft soon.
pfff
archimedes was one of the great scientific minds of our past.
of course ford is all about the money  who isn t
wait wait wait. did i hear this right  the  hero  fleabag is going to prevent  the villain  from going back in time to kill hitler  thus making sure the holocaust happens.if this is true  what the hell were the writers smoking to make them think this would make the  hero  appear heroic and noble
the fact they green lit the title  dial of destiny  pretty much says it all
harrison ford and fleabag in indiana woke and the dire of disney
this is sacrilege. crystal skull was already next level ridiculous. it was painfully obvious when it was indy and stuntman  that horrible cgi  vine swinging  mutt... the last crusade was literally the perfect ending of a perfect trilogy. they literally rode into the sunset
arcamedes  ar-kuh-me-deez  smh
sounds like ai generated script.
indy  being born in 1899  would have been 70 years old in the movie. i m 69 and not a feeble old man. indy was a pretty tough guy and believe he could take a punch from a 130 lb woman..
@ville billie  take a punch  if this leak is right she knocks him out
lakesuperior orityoriginal creation
brie larson s fans bots were multiplying in  the jeffersons marvels  comment sections here on yt weaponizing brie starring in  fast x   i m disappointed with anti-wokeism channels who are giving a pass to  fast x  because that only gives power to these actresses who play stereotypical feminist type of character.same fans bots are advocating for brie to play samus in a upcoming  metroid  movie... if larson draws numbers at the box office  who knows if that becomes reality
fleabag is short round if he was stripped of all his energy and charm.
truly sad
beautiful
indiana jones ended with the last crusade  i dont know what this is but it s not indiana jones.
i was just looking at twitter settings yesterday. you don t need an extension for dark mode
honestly  they should have ended things with crystal skull. i used to ask why can t we have nice things  but after listening to a few videos from the fourth age  now i understand  the progressives are determined to take everything from us
the last jedi 2.0!
threw me for more of a loop that melonie wasn t sitting down
who keeps stealing mels furniture  they took her chair now!!
punching out octogenarians is usually not seen as  heroic  behavior haha
they can never touch the classics which is probably the only solace we have.
don t know what you guys are talking about.  onlythreemovies
seeing as though i m a massive fan of this franchise and have been since the nineties  it s incredibly disappointing seeing as though i wanted one good indiana jones film before harrison ford hangs up the fedora.
archimedes  youngin .
someone please put all the disney franchises into the cryogenic chamber with walt so that he can resuscitate them when they reanimate him
i wish melonie would dress up as classic lara whenever the episode is about despicable jones and the insufferable feminist.
elder abuse
i just can t wrap my head around the fact that they actually thought it d be a good idea to introduce a new character most people don t give a fuck about  and have her one punch our childhood hero because he doesn t agree with her about something she s bent out of shape over. wow  what wonderful writing!they know damn well what they re doing. they know it s going to piss people off  and that s exactly why they do it. they re adult children that never grew out of getting petty rises out of everyone. they re going to hemorrhage money until kennedy and phoebe are millions of miles away from lucasfilm. disney will likely suffer the same fate until iger is finally torn out of his office and cast out of disney for good!
it s pronounced arkimeedees.  isn t it
your  spoilers  are probably a far more accurate review than the actual plotline itself - thanks for covering this  miss mac!already got my indiana jones fix just watching through again the original trilogy before the end of last year. and i take a page from  screwattack s older top tens  specifically their  top 10 franchises that should die   yes  that was the actual top ten name! .nervusnick  some trilogies tell a complete story as they are. take indiana jones for instance - perfectly made trilogy - it got a fourth movie that no one wanted.  and i know that they were talking about a certain fps series in that context  but the logic still applies  - you can ask craig from sidescrollers - by the way  nice that you made an appearance on that podcast earlier this week   god bless you  melonie mac! go boom!
i came here from a year old video with you and the drinker  great stuff you guys were talking about and you seem honest and nonconformist  which is a positive word nowadays . looking forward to checking out your work.
i want that statue!
i don t get why we can t have both. why can t we keep the indiana jones character and also start a seperate  unrelated new franchise with a female character  they don t have to try to piggyback off of established franchises to replace those characters. it s malicious. it sucks.
arki-mee-deez  -greek mathematician  engineer  physicist....aaaaand also the grumpy owl from sword in the stone.
noooooo you spolied it!!  now i ll have to spend my money on something else!
3 films. that s it. perfect trilogy. the other 2 don t exist in my mind. fan fiction crap. actually  that s an insult to fan fiction. i m sure the majority of it is better than crystal skull and dial of disaster.
disney hope loses all their money for the disrespect to everything they touch.
indiana jones as we know him  would never behave like that  even if he had a hard time  he would preserve history and face his problems chin up. this movie is just meant to humiliate the character in favor of a strong whaman tired trope. i wonder why in the world harrison ford of all people is ok with it.
harrison ford has been very  unapologetic  in the fact he does movies for money. good for him  i guess. bad for all of us cause he s doing garbage and destroying his own legacy.
i m having impure thoughts about this woman
last one was pretty horrible
modern cinema  that s why she is there. every movie now needs an entitled arrogant smartassing know it all female of course perfect in every way possible.
ar-ka-me-dees
archimedes. you re mispronouncing his name and seem not to know who he was     back to school  please. otherwise agree on the disaster this film is going to be.
your a cutie
the first i saw that woman i didnt liked her  i wanted a woman like willie.
it s so bad and cringe
my theory is that the original casting director had gal gadot for this  and kathleen kennedy shot that down because gal gadot is too attractive to men.
by all means spoil. i don t plan on watching this movie.
archimedeeees .not archimeeds
still no bible verse
hollywood challenge  make a movie without mentioning nazis  slavery  sexism or having 117 lb woman beat up a 250 lb mandifficulty  impossible
indiana jones and  the green milk of destiny.
i think we are all approaching peak woke fatique....i hope the trend continues...
alleged   so not real
breaking news!  phoebe waller-bridge was just cast as lara croft in a new tomb raider reboot that will begin filming early 2024.  you re welcome.
hearing you pronounce archimedes  ar-keh-me-deez  reminded me of this hilarious wheel of fortune clip. lolhttps   www.youtube.com watch v jgeldp1kura
you deserve a
i m surprised he doesn t trans into diana jones
replace lara croft with her older brother steve
harrison ford is getting old and he just wanted to get it done regardless of the script the tried so many times to rewrite it what does sandwich he can do
it s all about indoctrination of the young. x
ok mel os goregous lol never paid attention.
jones faced nazis and snakes and he gets knocked by a fleabag  weak!
i haven t cringed once  but then i am an adult.
i am all for strong female leads  and heros.   i don t understand this fascination with writers thinking the only way for one to exist is to replace an established male hero with a woman.  it comes off as cheap  and disingenuous... like the writers themselves don t have enough confidence in women characters to stand on a fan base of their own making.  give us more original  strong heroines and stop crapping on fans who like existing male heros.
even indiana is having a hard time
don t fall for it its just a reddi leak with no real merrits  i read the thing it seems like they just took the parts of the trailers we ve seen and eleborated on it. leaving out important things that we ve only seen in the latest trailer and has been updated regulerly
indiana jones is almost 80  hitting someone that old over the head usually kills them instead of knocking them out. i would have liked to have seen the movie end with her getting arrested with elder abuse.
wait she punches an 80 year old man out cold  and she s a hero disney s weird morals again.
star wars and indiana jones were my childhood. done watching anything new with star wars and will not  be seeing the new indiana jones movie. when i want my star wars fix ill pull from 1-6. when i want my indy fix ill pull from 1-3. disney should just come full circle and change the name to indiana jones and the big pile of dog sh!t before the movie releases.
kathleen kennedy is one that messed this up.
what cam did you use for recording
me thinks you have never heard of ark-a-mee-dees  not ark-a-meeds lol.
archimedes is pronounced aa kuh mee deez
i m as eager to see this movie as i am to have kidney stones.
i want to be like my herosi want my heroes to be like me a failure
it s heroic to puch out an 80 year old
ar-ka-me-dees.just a fyi.
this is what happens when you put a feminist in charge of a production company  i m talking about kathleen kennedy btw
great video  to your last point i think because laura croft was written by men originally that that s even enough to get the woke hollywood to tear down her character. just a guess tho
indiana jones and the ego feminist trip.
ark-eh-meed-eez.
sounds like good old bait and switch . also going by this  the movie sound horrible  i m really sad about it . would of preferred him to go out in a blaze of glory saving a younger version of him self   giving him real purpose. sound like the same ending as crystal skull !and we all know what a great movie that was !
melmac and shoeonhead need to collab!
you know a movie will be crap when the pr team is trying to  protect  it before releasing
er isnt having a plance crash thousands of years before flight was discovered already fuxxked time
there are only 3 indiana jones films. that s all there is to it.
indiana jones and the dial of density. my father  george.
man rip indiana jones talk about trashing your leaguy i knew this was doomed from start disney officially ruined good franchise
he always said he doesn t care.
this film will bomb. insanity
indiana jones is a pensioner  just in case you forgot...
they changed the ending
kanye s gonna be pissed.
muricans   this archimedes guy
we will file this away with the crystal skull. what new indiana jones movie  don t be silly  there has only ever been 3 movies
too distracted by  archi-meeds  lol -famous mathmetician and ... hitler stan
indiana jones and the insufferable feminist. not watching it  even when it will eventually be free on cable
this thumbnail made me laugh out loud
so it s false advertising.  should be titled  pwb s character   the dial of destiny--with indiana jones .  but--who tf would go
is that laura standing on a pack of budlight
the franchise use to be about watching indie jones go on adventure but nooo  they want to show us some garbage that dumbs down everyone just for the garbage to one up him.
why does madds mickelson continue joining the dead on arrival films smh great actor but he has been on terrible films lately
mary sue outshining the male hero and even belittling the male hero to be propped up as strong wahmen is so predictable at this point .marvel has done it with the m-she-u and lucasfilm does it with every movie and show.keep it coming disney i enjoy watching you lose money while you ruin your ips.
lucasfilm wasnt satisfied with ruining han solo so they went and did it again with indiana jones
mary sue doing everything better than indy is kks modus operandi .
this sounds too stupid not to be true
and sarah the female that should have had transgender person there at least that would have made sense
indiana jones ended in 1989.
harrison ford is 80 but how old is indiana jones in this movie
i miss the days where men could be men and women could be women.   well - tomorrow looking to get some  tuck friendly  swim ware.   time to tuck the junk.  it will take a lot of tucking - i will give it a shot.
she can punch indiana jones out because of all her girl power.
his co star should have been ke huy quan  not phoebe.
the sequel trilogy was basically what if kk was the lead and indiana jones is no different.she is so envious it s not funny.never forget she was a young woman who in my mind always felt she should ve been in the line light.... lol
the solution is simple. don t watch any of these new crappy movies.
right  so  marion shows up and its all right with the world   so it takes marion  a woman  to save him from his terrible self.....ugh!
all three movies had indy fist fighting huge guys but that scrawny fleabag is gonna knock him out with a punch  sure... they could at least have her hit him from behind with a chair!
i bet phoebe munches on kathleen s carpet for the roles in lucasfilm
the trailer did not make me  want to watch this movie... old frail indy..woman with no face and no curves and a smart mouth playing an action heroine   helena shaw to me is just irritating
well  he is 80 years old so he probably needs a little help ... seriously  there are 3 indiana jones movies. that s it.
the archimedes from ancient greece  i mean with the time travel thing and all that...
who wants to have found memories of movie franchises. let s have them all destroyed so we hate them and never want to watch them ever again. star warsalienspredatorindiana joneslord of the rings the list goes on and on
nothing matters anymore
honestly who expected anything else
errrgh errgh  grimdiana groans and the drool of drearyness!
hmmmm oh well.   the ending i wanted to see  besides indy kicking his feet up to finally relax  was nag-atha brody trying to return the idol from raiders of the lost ark and her accidentally stepping into the light.  missed opportunity.  lmao.  f    disney lucasfilm
why is everyone turning into will smith with these movies
just keep in mind that the original movies will always exist. same with star wars.
it might have been more interesting if he had dementia and didn t know who he was
rip indiana.
phoebe reminds me of a single mum going through a mid life crisis.
however  it should also be noted that harrison ford is a volunteer in this moronic film. why does he allow his beloved film role to be destroyed by kk and phoebe waller-bridge. is he really that greedy or just too old to see through kk s stupid game.
what audience is lucasfilm and disney is pandering to this movie doesn t wins my attention.
they could have both like they always did have strong female characters but still had indiana jones. why would you not go fo a billion dollars plus if you could
they can keep lara croft strong  but she can t also be hot.
i understand the premise   can an older indiana jones still do it   but  i am lacking any sense of do it and all the sense of  can    cmon harrison ford...do better
i just assumed this  shrug
not so brave  not so attentive...  cmon man!!!!
it just occurred to me that phoebe waller bridge is a dead ringer for lea thomas. interesting
just like star wars   disney destroys indiana jones.
time travel...best left to a madman with a bllue police box.
there are 3 indiana jones films. that is all.
read the following and compare it with  now   2 timothy 3 1-7 1 this know also  that in the last days perilous times shall come.2 for men shall be lovers of their own selves  covetous  boasters  proud  blasphemers  disobedient to parents  unthankful  unholy  3 without natural affection  trucebreakers  false accusers  incontinent  fierce  despisers of those that are good  4 traitors  heady  highminded  lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god  5 having a form of godliness  but denying the power thereof  from such turn away.6 for of this sort are they which creep into houses  and lead captive silly women laden with sins  led away with divers lusts 7 ever learning  and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. we are in the last days!now know this  the most beautiful wedding of all time is about to take place soon.this wedding will  be the biggest party of all time and many people will be there!the good news is you can go to this amazing party too!here is your  wedding invitation  if you believe that jesus christ died on the cross for your sins  was buried and rose again the third day  you will be saved and have eternal life! this is your  wedding invitation  the good news aka the gospel  1 corinthians 15 1-4 1 moreover  brethren  i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you  which also ye have received  and wherein ye stand 2 by which also ye are saved  if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you  unless ye have believed in vain.3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received  how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 4 and that he was buried  and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures   do you not want to get eternal life only jesus christ can save you and give you eternal life! john 14 6  jesus saith unto him  i am the way  the truth  and the life  no man cometh unto the father  but by me.  maranatha
once he could on nazis in a tank and men twice his size  now he cant take a punch from a 100 lb woman
keep a physical copy.
dang it  you spoiled that pile of shit that was in the toilet before i got to peak into the bowl myself
so is actress and some studio ppls gonna blame the leak for the poor turn out for the movie   spose well have to wait and see
there are no more indiana jones movies after the last crusade. that s why it was called the last crusade.
oh no. spoilers for indy 5. now the movie is ruined for me.  now  read it again  with dripping sarcasm.
i guess movie studios didn t see or ignore top gun maverick where the og male wasn t pushed into the background to push females.
how the fuck does a punch from phoebe waller bridge knock indy out  i don t care if he s almost 80 years old it should be the equavilent of a love tap!
solid video. new viewer subscriber.
ohh just saying anyone can knock out anyone. you dont nred alot of force.just the right amount at the right place
they gave indy the same markhammill treatment.
when will they learn  we  i  will not pay you to tell us the heroes we looked up to and or enjoyed watching are not as good or heroic as we think !!!
lucky for me i don t care about spoilers for this because after what happened at cannes with this movie i refuse to give disney another dime of my money for this trash they continue to produce
the only time travel movies i ever liked were the back to the future movies..because i was too young to realize how dumb the concept of time travel is.  time  doesnt exist. its just a unit of measurement that we use in our mortal lives..but its not some  thing  that you can  travel  through.. this and the  multiverse  are my 2 most disliked  sci fi  concepts.ok the multiverse.. so theres endless variations of everyone out there...vastly different from the ones here.. yet everyone s ancestors still got together to reproduce  asinine
why would you pin your divorce papers on your fridge with a picture of your wife who wants the divorce
she didn t punch him  she blah blah blah wamins rights blah blah to him till he was unconscious
sure i don t want a movie where an 80 year old harrison ford jumps around like he s 20 years old. so by all means acknowledge his age.maybe have him be the dad in this one. ala what sean connery was in last crusade. ala they are caught in this deathtrap and while indiana jones is to old to just muscle his way out of it  his sidekick isn t  but she doesn t know how to block the mechanism the prevent the trap from killing them. so they work together she is  the muscle  and he is the brain. treat the character with respect  that s all most fans want. picard season 3 was an excellent example of how to acknowledge that your characters have grown old and how to pass on the torch to the next generation.
ever since the first trailer  i knew this was gonna be another kathleen kennedy feminist fan fiction bait and switch.
look up corporate equality index please  it answer everything why everything woke oh  why she is here  she a woke replacement for indyjust like james bond died...we going to have a black gay bond
i love and respect harrison ford but this movie is not it my franchise end at the last crusade
they are making this movie for the make-believe fanbase they think they have. they don t  so the movie will flop thank you you re welcome
punching an old man       how heroic!!!
from starwars.. hes just in the corner cowering
the cringe is real
yep definitely do not plan on seeing this movie. thank you for saving me  100 on a movie ticket
i m boycotting this film for its promotion of elder abuse.
just dangle some shiny things in front of their eyes action  effects  stunts explosions  and they ll eat it up. setting up the mary sue to take over is the whole point in making the movie. that and raking in the dough from all the popcorn munching the lemmings. as p.t. barnum said  there s a sucker born every minute.
think we knew it was going to be crap.
indy 5 should have been focused on indy daughter
everything coming out of hollywood is stupid nowadays especially disney that s why i only watched scary movies just now at least they re entertaining
in my version after that choice the come back to the future and the world s ruled by apes...
how can you spoil crap  this movie is very much d.o.a it may start big but after word of mouth it will fall off a cliff. after all the  reshoots and book scrapping this movie will have to break at least 1.2 billion just to break even
i couldn t care less about hearing spoilers.. i have no plans to see the dial of dysentery anyway.
feeble waller looks exactly like a feminist character  not hog faced  but not attractive enough to offend feminists.
you are incredibly gorgeous
they continue to ruin things!
ark-a-mead-ease
you don t know who archimedes was   and it s arc eh mee dees
people don t like there hero s giving up for nough reason.
i don t want to watch the dial of woke destiny!
ofcourse she has to punch him and save the world cause this is a feminist woke film and how dare a man save the world.
you know the movie is crap when ford said disney ruined me
dial of woke
it s ark-uh-mee-dees  not arch-ih-meeds lol
thanks melanie mac
harrison was always ambiguous not athletic
hey maybe it will be so bad that it is good.
indiana jones getting the luke skywalker treatment. lucasfilm bozo s are at it again.
marion punches him in raiders.
why are you here  don t you have moose to hunt in alaska
nop sorry melanie
there is no way indy from the first 3 moves would ever attempt to change history. that seem out of character.
i can t wait to not watch this movie.
fucking claymore is awesome
ark uh meedeez
we need a good lara croft movie  been way too long
so  what s been seen that s making you cringe   lol
i m so glad they only made three of these films and left it right there.
back in the day we just knew we wasted a few bucks at the theater if you didn t like the movie. today you are now a member of a violent hate group. like wtf happened..
this sounds lame and sad.  i like how someone else put it  indiana jones and the tampon of doom.indy was the last hero.  now they re all gone.  good job  hollywood.
why can t shereally defeated.. by a force ofevil proportions..
what s with divorcing beloved movie couple s
more like indiana jones and the diarrhea of destiny am i right
don t run away from your feelings
this movie will make the crystal skull a masterpiece
newly subscribed.
so whose the bad guy these plot leaks don t really explain anything
kk destroyer of ips!!willow checkstar wars checkindiana jones check check
another movie where the seasoned hero is mocked and ridiculed by an unlikable female protagonist.pass
female on male violence. got it
they did that to lara croft because she s not some 500 pound green haired activist.
im sorry but everyone should watch the movie first and then say anything about it. it s just an adventure movie  helena isn t woke or anything  we have mads mikkelsen as the main villain  we have an interesting artifact  and an 1944 sequence. it will be fun  idc what critics says  they wanted more than just an adventure movie  i want an adventure movie  a great ending  plot leaks said that it s great  so im okay. how about you guys
lord im tired lol
what a freaking fiasco of a dumpster fire movie.
she can knock him out because he s like 85 years old  .  how heroic of her to hit an elderly man lol
they travel back in time to ancient greece  who came up with this stupid plot   this reminds me of   bill and ted s excellent adventure  but that movie was fun. and than the beloved male hero character is knocked out by a marysue !  if j rgen voller is a true nazi he would not kill hitler  but key persons of wwii like chamberlain or patton. he would use his future knowledge to easily make the nazis win key battles of wwii. this movie will bomb like hell. all the youtubers will have field days . fun video as always mel  but your pronunciation of archimedes is wrong.
can t believe the amazing indiana jones series that had an amazing trilogy have 2 trashbag fanfics
it sounds like they snatched from back to the future.  what you read didn t sound anything like indiana jones  but a lot like back to the future.
wait so the bad guy... is doing the i ll go back and kill hitler thing      this movie sounds so terrible. i now want to watch the crystal skull again so that i can at least see a happy ending.
free laura croft in melonie mac s room of solitude.
i pray this film ends up like solo  because solo lost money . .   lol   p
i saw a comment that said  this looks like joe biden starring in a remake of rambo
the plot is beyond idiotic. my 8 year old daughter could have come up with something better.
indy  being born in 1899  would have been 70 years old in the movie. he proved he could take a punch throughout the movie franchise. i m 69 but that does not make me a feeble old man.
@ville billie  don t gotta take me too seriously. just making jokes fam
this movie sounds awful - i highly doubt many fans of the original movies will go to see this. lucasfilm has badly lost its way.if they wanted to have a lead female character in an action movie  why didn t they just create a new thing rather than trying to pull a bait and switch with indy  hollywood seems to have lost all creativity and the ability to tell a good story with compelling characters. plus they re obsessed with pozzing everything with woke politics  i wonder if they re even interested in creating art or making profits anymore.
by the power of yasss queen
archimedes died about 2000 years before hitler was born. they really went back in time if that s true.
well  he is 109 years old
yikes.
you cant spoil something i wont be watching
kathleen kennedy and her sycophants at disney have destroyed numerous great male characters. but i will not participate in the insanity. i m only disappointed that harrison ford was involved in the destruction of indiana jones.
this movie will fail horribly
can you turn mic up by 750
woof
less than five minutes into the first episode of fleabag  her character diddled herself while watching barack obama.
well indiana is 80 years old  maybe she could knock him out
hehehe...now i m just gonna have to sit back and watch this movie bomb so hard it trumps the atom bomb...p.s. i feel sad for harrison ford....he didn t deserve this.. especially after the iconic first trilogy raiders of lost ark  temple of doom and last crusade...
i was looking forward to see this movie....but now  i m not sure if i want to see it
i might go by a theatre where this is being shown  wont be bothering to stop
oh word  you changed the background a bit  cool  yea it s a no for me dawg  i ll just watch the o.g. s and pretend these new piles of boo boo don t exist lol
so indi who was always on the side of doing the right thing for the right reasons is made out to be the bad guy just because woke . looks like this could be another bud light lol .
i have no intentions of seeing it .
standing melanie meke me honny
i stopped watching any of disney s fan fiction after the second time they destroyed star wars
they destroyed indiana jones...
spoil away.  i have no intention of seeing  indiana jones and the dump from disney
bill and ted did it better
the story origins of the character are bad enough. but the fourth movie made me turn face. and now this ...
indiana jones   the denial of disaster
so a strong female character is bad all of a sudden
phoebe waller bridge and the indiana of jones
never watched kingdom of the crystal skull  not gonna watch this. it just seems weird and boring.
yeah so here is the deal. i never watched crystal skull. i m sure as hell not watching this. it ended with the last crusade. it was supposed to end with the last crusade. i own all three. it s hollywood that can make requels to edge out sequels to not be canon. so can i. without any requel. you only need the first three.
i think the little mermaid will be more profitable than indiana jones 5.
katken took the  anything goes  lyrics too literally...
indiana jones and the insufferable slag
the dial tone of density is bad fanfic. the last entry into the indy franchise was secret of atlantis. go play if you haven t  it s a fun point-and-click game from the 90s that is like a 4th movie
i didnt think it was possible to get any cringier.
how many times has indiana jones been punched in the face either on top of a tank. writing a boat while standing up. fighting numerous assassins coming at him on top of an airplane in a dirigible. while getting stabbed in the back. you re going to tell me this 140 lb male face looking s he that she s going to knock him out......  her  it  she s going to knock him out    wtf.... he s taking more punches to the face than mike tyson yet this thing phoebe is going to knock him out they should have just ended with crystal skull i mean that movie wasn t impressive but at least it had an ending that i could accept that his son was going to take over.
melonie just watch this thing on our behalf  i hate everything phoebe waller bridge is in it
we never asked for an indiana jane movie.
this and acolyte are kennedy s last chances with disney. we shall see...
disney is where pop culture goes to die.
i m pretty sure during the roman siege of syracuse they didn t have airplanes .  and back then  i find it hard that she could punch him and not get arrested cause women didn t have the same liberties back then.  it s okay if women go back and change history but men can t lol.
women have generally had some serious privileges in western society.
indiana jones and the dial of death
spoiler alert  the plot of this movie sucks and indy gets knocked out by a woman because wahmen. then something about hitler  idk.
talk about cringe  your apartment
i m pretty sure gina carano could knock out a 75 year old man. probably a man half that age
so the villain in the new indiana jones... is indiana jones. lol. peak woke.
this whole indiana jones video was cringe. melonie stop the cap.
as a jew who loves movies but understands the socialsphere. i would be shocked if they didn t have a forgivable nazi. antisemitism is popular af and my iphone won t even auto spell it for me apparently
gina is not the kind of woman who bullies and beats up the elderly.  that s why she didn t fit in at lucasfilm.
@harold b  true  true.... but does anyone doubt she s capable
i enjoy melonies videos
@the real stephentv   awesome man. enjoy them she s cool lady. why does she dislike the marvels so much that s my only question.
@jonathan sanders  you must be new here. because marvel and disney have been producing nothing but crap lately. we re all sick of it.
