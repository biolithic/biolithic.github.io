i would consider this a win. and pray that netflix doesn t get it.
considering amazons recent history with it s treatment of established franchises tomb raider may have just dodged a bullet.
i d rather them do nothing than ruin it by making it woke and ridiculous.
well given how amazon handled some other games  this might be a dodged bullet. a woke company like amazon would do more damage alone than any of the crystal dynamics games ever did.
look at the bright side. amazon can t  woke  it up and tick off all the fans.
i really want an old-school tomb raider game.
seems like all anyone does these days is  try to take over  an existing franchise and make it their own. i can t think of anytime where that s worked. anyway  have a great day melonie. great video as always and your hair is so pretty today
this is win for tomb raider fans.  because otherwise you d have gotten a  check-the-boxes  woman on a mobility scooter.  and by  woman  i mean lia thomas.
well look at the bright side  at least this means amazon won t tarnish tomb raider s reputation further
so long as phoebe waller-bridge is kept away from miss croft  then that s enough for me.
it s like hollywood hates people for appreciation attractive women in badass roles!
as much as i love lara and tr since childhood  i have dropped all faith in this franchise the moment those leaks surrounding the potential sequel reboot surfaced. the amazon purchase was the nail in the coffin
once i heard this news i was thinking  i wonder what melonie is going to think
good points made  melonie  but legacy of kain was arguably better with crystal dynamics  interference. it s also where most of the fandom comes from. but the cd of today isn t the same as the one from 20 years ago.
i just want good classic lara craft. you look absolutely beautiful today melonie. you been doing incredible with all the live streams lately. have a wonderful day.
so hopefully they aren t going to ruin it then. hey melonie. you look absolutely beautiful. i hope you have a great day.
this is great news  that woke leaked script about lara being lonely and suddenly wanting a girlfriend would have killed the franchise. thank goodness for this news.
i hope they do drop tomb raider. cinema needs to stop ruining beloved game franchises. great video today melonie! you look amazing today also love what you did with your hair too!
this is a blessing in disguise. duke nukem fans and tomb raider fans are in the same boat these days. every once in a while there is a whisper of hope while the franchise is held hostage by a developer that doesn t love it or do it justice if they even do anything with it.
this is great news!  i hope mass effect talks with amazon go in the same direction. salke would destroy that ip too.
just keep it with embracer  no need for these huge companies who most likely have completely out of touch people.
@_maz_ter_  that s ironic because the embracer-group is a pretty huge corporation  too.although  it s not as affected by  modern politics  compared to other companies.
@liberatus blair  problem is most major companies influence political agendas themselves. you see there s this illusion that everyday citizens have a say on who gets into government that s untrue  most corporations will side with political alliances that can deliver their message or make them sell the most products.everyone thinks that those in power have a say  they really don t the corporations that give financial support pull the strings.
same here. it would be fine with me if amazon and netflix went broke at some point. i absolutely despise them and every other woke company. we have put up with their crap for too long.
netflix does get it right sometimes but i rather see hbo or apple doing it.
wasn t the castlevania series for netflix meant to be good  i don t know because i m not a fan but i ve heard nothing but good things about it from castlevania fans.still  one exception doesn t mean anything i guess. i loved arcane but it s a single shining diamond in a sea of human feces.
@jade runner 2049  i did quite enjoy castlevania and arcane  but i think those escape the notice of people like the teddy  the guy who actually made he-man  not kevin smith . but by what the very essence of what tomb raider is  i don t think it could escape people like hims  notice. i d just rather be safe than sorry.
@jade runner 2049  indeed  netflix can do great shows it s not all doom and gloom. hopefully tr gets picked up somewhere and they respect  it like tlou show  that was great adaption of a video game.
you misspelled   amazon
you dodged a fat boy.
yes! it s been saved
to late they already did that
@bowsette  it could be way worse. two words  lesbian lara
i d rather be woke than discriminitive.
@seven ellen  then go do that. no need to drag tr there.
i didn t even watch the last one that was made with  young  lara.  no interest
cd is just as woke
@laracroftonline  i know they are. i didn t say their games didn t do damage to tomb raider. amazon however  is much worse  just look at what they ve dropped on us. rings of power was a disgrace to lotr  new world was garbage  and they have been censoring the hell out of the western release of lost ark.
@sok the rat  you misspelled   amazon
@sok the rat  morfydd clark as lara would have been worth it though.
what  you re alone in that  all cd games have high acclaim and are far more successful than any tr game. rise of tomb raider especially is one of if not the greatest tr game.
@sok the rat  makes you wonder what they will do to blue protocol.
@mr mxyzptlk  high acclaim from a media that thinks forspoken is high art.
@danny dimes  uh what  no  acclaim from people  yknow fans who play the games. the consensus. no one liked forspoken it was widely disliked by the consensus and it sold like shit. cd tr sold 10 times more than any tr games prior and had the acclaim from fans to go with it.
@mr mxyzptlk  fine  enter any silly millennial humor game you zoomers love so much. the point is  zoomers  being you  are terrible arbiters of taste  and using money is silly. rise of skywalker made a billion dollars  by your logic that makes it one of the greatest movies ever made.
crystal dynamics could still just do that themselves.
yea the reboot games are already woke.
is that sarcasm
hopefully fleabag doesn t follow the ip to wherever it ends up.
@king harkinian  something tells me that by september  flea bag won t be able to get work at all.
i know right. i would absolutely play the heck out of new tomb raider game with the same type of gameplay as the first five entries  and i know a couple of other people who would too.i get that it would probably be a bit niche nowadays  but you don t have to give it a aaa budget.
i think they want to do some old stuff after trilogy  i really hope they back to legend vibes  it s perfect bland.
the old ones are fun but to a lot of people just looking for treasures and solving puzzles gets boring you only fight a few things in the original games. people need more than just solving puzzles and finding treasures. cause i have tomb raider anniversary tomb raider legends tomb tomb raider underworld and those are good games for what they are but the new trilogy is a h    of a lot more funner.
i have also played all the other original games and i still think the newer trilogy is more funner. to play cause there s more to do than just. solving puzzles and finding treasures.
yes  i want the classic with the only changes would be manual aiming   camera would be great.
thank you joseph!  d
@melonie mac go boom  of course  melonie.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin good forces have invented or made -tolkienn
i would say soul reaver is the exception that proves the rule  and it s kind of annoying hearing melonie use it as an example.soul reaver  and what amy hennig did with the legacy of kain franchise  was light years better than the original blood omen  and the entire reason lok has a fanbase at all is because of hennig s games.blood omen is a fine game  but i have personally never met a legacy of kain fan who considered it their favourite. in fact  every lok fan i ve ever met have all agreed that hennig taking over the franchise was a blessing  and that what she did was far better than the blood omen creator s original plan.melonie is undoubtedly correct about what has happened to tomb raider  but using legacy of kain as as an example of them doing it before and shltting on soul reaver is way  way off. the circumstances were totally different  i don t believe any of the people working at crystal dynamics at the time of soul reaver were still working there when tomb raider 2013 was made  and hennig is an objectively superior writer to the blood omen writers.  the legacy of kain fanbase is not a divided fanbase  at least on this issue  with one half favoring the blood omen creator s  original vision  and the other half favoring the  different direction  amy hennig took the series in  virtually every member of the lok fanbase prefers hennig s direction. it also happened so early in the franchis s life that everyone in the lok fanbase considers hennig s legacy of kain to be the  real legacy of kain.
aliens is another exception.
@jade runner 2049  amy henig and the larger ideological world she s part of hadn t lost their minds in hysteria yet. they were able to think about what might be good without stressing over how this promotes or defeats the next trump  fascism  holocaust  transphobia  etc etc
@cktable i don t disagree.san francisco  man. there s something in the water there  i guess.
crystal dynamics actually did an excellent job with legacy of kain. they didn t balls it up like they did with tomb raider. dyack can complain all day long about how amy hennig didn t fallow his original vision  but the fact is barely anyone had ever heard of blood omen before soul reaver released  and if he had been able to make his  blood omen 2  it would likely have been a complete bomb. it s hard to imagine he could have garnered equal-or-greater popularity for the franchise with his hypothetical sequel s  than hennig did with hers.fact is  blood omen was simply never that popular  and what popularity it does have today is almost entirely due to the attention hennig s games bring it. blood omen wasn t like tomb raider - an already massively popular and successful franchise with a devoted fanbase.
these days .. hate to break it to ya  buddy but this has been going on since the entertainment industry was founded.. how many versions of sherlock holmes or tarzan have we had...
lmfao
by tarnish  milk it to death. i already feared amazon will turn it into star wars with million side stories  which this franchise isn t about.
flea bag is busy ruining indiana jones.
@hamanu666  there was talks of her attempting to hijack tomb raider also.
every ip she touches she destroys james bond and indiana jones are good examples.
@hetairoi7  and she was in solo too and we all know how that turned out.
she is going for the treble. three franchises that were once successful. poison bridge gets involved. failure. star war s. bond and indiana jones will be next.
i love how pw-b just totally lives rent-free inside the heads of incels... it s soooooo funny..
for me all media entertainment has stopped early 2000 s but i ve played every game and watched every movie i could ever wished for!
@rgerber      yikes you missed out on a lot. imagine missing out on inception  inglorious basterds  gta 4  gta 5  rdr  rdr2  the dark knight  the batman  no way home  infinity war  breaking bad  sopranos  chernobyl  wolf of wall street  the departed  witcher 3  god of war 2018  fallout new vegas  rise of tomb raider and loads more  feel bad for you tbh
yup. there s only two things that can save tr now 1  that it gets sold off to a studio that actually cares and wants to make a proper tr game.or2  that it remains dead for long enough that another studio decides it s time to make a  spiritual successor   and we get something new in the same style.of course  both of those require that a new studio does a good job of it  and that s the real challenge here.
yeah  soul reaver et al was a great series. too bad everyone disbanded after defiance.
@mr. p  definitely. it s craaaazy to think that it s been 20 years since we last had an entry in the series. with the way the industry looks like today  i m almost afraid of what a new entry will look like.
@kain scion  20 years this year. i had just finished my first semester in college when i played it. i mean i already felt old but good lord.yeah  as much as i would love to have seen a proper ending   i wouldn t trust it. definitely not without hennig.
that s not really supricing. legacy of kain was an action focused game  which is what crystal dynamics was comfortable with making  it s what they understood and were good at.tomb raider was not an action game  and that s a big part of why crystal dynamics did so poorly with it. they kept trying to force more combat into these games  but that s not what tr was about  it s not what tr fans were looking for in a tr game  and so it never clicked with it s target audience.in the old tr games  combat mostly just existed to keep you on your toes  as a side-mechanic to prevent the puzzle solving and exploring from getting stale  add that little element of risk. when you did encounter enemies though  they were quickly dispatched if you were on your guard  but they could also do lots of damage if you were just mindlessly yolo ing around  ergo it kept you on your toes . the main meat of the game was always the exploration and puzzles though.in the cd games  enemies became bullet sponges  they added annoying  dodge at the right moment to do a qte headshot  mechanics that were just awful  especially as they made the enemies super tanky just so you had to use the mechanic  and they kept trying to force these dreadful combat arena s  often with generic black-ops dudes with assault rifles that were suddenly all over these games... that s just not tomb raider  and it never really worked well. the generic third-person-shooter elements cd kept trying to force into the franchise just didn t gel well with the pre existing tr elements.and of course  cd didn t create lara croft  and sadly didn t really seem to understand her  how to write a game for her  which created all sorts of problems aswell.they were not the right studio for this franchise  it just wasen t a good fit.
i wouldn t call kain an action game. narrative based adventure similar to zelda more like
@geoffrey chauvin  really  we re going to  well actually  about how much action is required to call something  more action based  than tr i m not nearly autitistic enough for that conversation  and my point still stands.
agreed
thank you so much  andrew!
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melanie!
cd dropped 3 great games tho. gearbox however dropped mediocre with duke nukem forever and has since been afraid to drop more out of fear of the woke mob.
agreed  thanks great videos
the problem tomb raider is facing is that nobody knows how to make good puzzles anymore. and that s a lot of what tomb raider was. i know a lot of people dunk on shadow  but it had the best challenge tombs. if they made a whole game of just those  i d be happy.
how is this bad  this is bloody great news. looking at the leaks and how it seemed very likely it was true i felt like tr was going to be trashed but upon hearing this that tr isn t going to be desecrated means we have a win here. they can t make lara something she s not. this is good because hopefully it means there is a chance someone who respects the brit girl shows her and the franchise the respect it so rightfully deserves. the legacy of kain franchise just went off the rails  it has no idea where it went. it s just a big mess. only a reboot can fix it.
i m not gonna turn adblock off for this.   relatable.
why don t they just do the remake route like resident evil 4 and final fantasy 7  literally remake the first game but for modern hardware. it would sell great.
crystal dynamics did pretty good with legacy of kain series  except the last one  they didn t highjack it they just built on it  especially for a franchise that had only one game that was like a point and click action! i feel that the creator of the series is just salty because of the way how the franchise changed hands at the time sure they built the basics of the universe but crystal dynamics created arguably the best game in the series  sr1 . different creatives  different ideas! tomb raider is a different story because lara s character and her universe was already established with multiple games... the early games from crystal dynamics felt a bit more close to the original even if it leaned more into action but the reboot trilogy is just a totally different character with way too different gameplay comapred to what came before!
crystal dynamics are competent developers who take popular ips and wear them as a skinsuit so they sell better. they don t have confidence in making original ips  despite being technically competent.
the amazon game  cd lost even amazon  lolyou look very pretty today  melonie
tomb raider  lara croft  is one of the biggest characters in gaming history and no one can build a game with her. it s mind blowing.
the difference between legacy of kain and tomb raider is that legacy of kain was indisputably improved by being taken over by crystal dynamics. sorry  but you can t compare what crystal dynamics did with legacy of kain with what they did to tomb raider. the legacy of kain fanbase absolutely loves crystal dynamics s legacy of kain era. no one considers it a bastardisation of the original creator s vision because  frankly  the original blood omen was never really that popular to begin with. most who played it didn t love it. the legacy of kain fandom didn t really exist until soul reaver  after which people looked up blood omen to find out what occurred in the timeline prior to soul reaver. the point i m making is that the legacy of kain fandom actually began with soul reaver  so it s disingenuous to say that crystal dynamics did the legacy of kain series  or its fans  a disservice by doing their own thing with the franchise - crystal dynamics s direction was precisely what the lok fans fell in love with in the first place with that franchise.they also didn t reboot or remake legacy of kain like they did with tomb raider. soul reaver is set in the same continuity as blood omen  just later  whereas tomb raider 2013 is a straight up reimagining of the original tomb raider games. it might sound like a trivial point  but it isn t. i can see how to a non-lok fan reading up on the history of the franchise s development might sound  on paper  very similar to the history of tomb raider  but in actuality the two situations are very different. you d be hard pressed to find a legacy of kain fan who doesn t rate the crystal dynamics games higher than silicon knights s blood omen. i ve been a legacy of kain fan for over 20 years and i ve literally never met one. we all consider soul reaver and the post-blood omen games to be better than blood omen - or at the very least we re all glad crystal dynamics did what they did with soul reaver.this is a stark contrast with the tomb raider fandom  who are pretty much 50 50 on which era of tomb raider is better   worse. that conflict simply doesn t exist within the legacy of kain fandom.
soul reaver is a masterpiece. i won t hear a word said against it.blood omen was good but i am glad crystal dynamics did what they did with it  as is the entire legacy of kain fanbase. melonie is way off on this one.new tomb raider is garbage  though.
the legacy of kain fanbase is not a divided fanbase  at least not on this issue  there aren t any legacy of kain fans who only like blood omen and consider everything that came after it - hennig s games - to be  not real legacy of kain.  every member of the legacy of kain fanbase loves hennig s games and considers them to be the  real legacy of kain.  the legacy of kain fanbase argues over whether soul reaver 2 was better than soul reaver  it was   whether soul reaver 2 was good or not  it was   whether blood omen 2 was an abomination or not  it wasn t  but it is definitely the weakest entry in the series   and whether defiance was good or not  to this day i am unsure where i stand on that one .no one in the legacy of kain fanbase argues over which is better  legacy of kain before amy hennig took over or legacy of kain after hennig took over. the entire fanbase  as far as i m aware  is in unanimous agreement that hennig s legacy of kain is the definitive legacy of kain.so your analogy is flawed  there. while taking over existing franchises may indeed be a pattern with crystal dynamics  and while in most cases the  new directions  they choose to take the franchises they ve acquired in is inferior to the original vision  to say this is always the case is incorrect  and it s ceraltainly wrong to use legacy of kain to back up your case on that point.but then  amy hennig left crystal dynamics before they took over tomb raider. maybe if hennig had directed tomb raider 2013 it would have been good.
11 18 but i have to say  denis dyack was 100  defeated by amy hennig.you can also say   piranha bytes  gothic1 defeated blood omen1.legacy of kain   elder god and soul reaverimportant!! blood omen1 failed to define the  nosgoth  setting. even in blood omen 1   nosgoth  remains arbitrary  so the reboot remake can completely ignore blood omen1 and denis dyack s contribution.reminder  every legacy-of-kain fan thinks of amy hennig when they think about a remake reboot.
legacy of kain was great and was cast in lore and written great.. if they did that series now they will kill it.
i m personally happy with this news. seeing as though this means we won t be getting that trashy tomb raider series written by flea bag herself. lol
no lie i can totally see melonie playing lara croft
if amazon drops tomb raider i say give the franchise to melonie she s probably the only person that knows exactly what to do with it.i remember playing angel of darkness it was terrible. legend   underworld were good but they couldn t match the original ps1 games. the reboot trilogy were good games but in my opinion they didn t feel like tomb raider to me.
sorry melonie  you may be right in your overall point about cd taking over franchises  but the original blood omen never had a huge fanbase  and the vast majority of legacy of kain fans are fans because of everything that came after blood omen. the consensus among legacy of kain fans is that the original plan for a blood omen sequel wouldn t have been nearly as good as what amy hennig ended up doing with the franchise - and as a die hard fan myself  i wouldn t want to live in a world without amy hennig s legacy of kain.soul reaver is a masterpiece in its own right  to dismiss it as an inferior cannibalisation of an existing franchise by an unoriginal developer is not just unfair  it s objectively wrong. blood omen is a good game but in my opinion it s got nothing on soul reaver.also  one of the creators of blood omen was a pedrofyle. just sayin .
the ip holder should hire as many ex-core design members as possible   continue the original timeline.
i m so jelly of that full sized lara statue
i was honestly excited just to have some new hands orchestrating the series to hopefully drive it in a new direction that s more reminiscent of the core design games. i just hope i see a new tr game i absolutely adore again before i m another ten years older. lara is lost in the mud
or like a crash bandicoot n sane trilogy
re4r has its esg moments. leon talking about having ptsd  ashley now being a strong wahmen. changes to character designs so as not offend people and bring capcoms esg score down. same with ff7r. it s been toned down for esg reasons. tifa being the main  example and the scene later in where cloud dresses as a girl was toned down. so hopefully tomb raider doesn t tone itself down like these games.
i think that s the point sr highjacked anothers franchise  whether you think sr is the better game is irrelevant it took the game in a direction it wasn t going to go.it would have been far better if sr had been its own thing  then you could have had two amazing franchises.  don t get me wrong  sometimes drawing a line in the franchises sand is a good thing take spiderman clone saga  it would have been better to keep ben spiderman and then have miles take over naturally.instead what we get is modern writers trying to kick peter in the nuts to show case how edgy they are.in fact most of the mess in american comics can be put on stupid character updates and recons
i agree they are terrible at developing original games but their tomb raider games did well i don t get the hate. i will say though amazon dropping it will be a blessing in disguise for tomb raider fans
@godsfavhitman  there is no hate  melonie hates it for some reason even tho she said she played rise multiple times and even streamed it. the games have widespread acclaim and have sold more copies than any tr game.
yup. would never have played blood omen had i not been introduced to the series through soul reaver. most of us are the same. cd may have made some poor decisions  but soul reaver was not one of them.
exactly. i like blood omen  but i m not in love with it like am the rest of the series.although it s kind of weird because once the later games begin to get heavily into time travel  the events of blood omen kind of become the backdrop that the rest of the series is centered around  with multiple factions all trying to alter the events of blood omen to attain power for themselves  so i guess you can never just totally dismiss blood omen as an irrelevant prologue to the main story.but the philosophical story of the later games exploring the dilemma of fate vs free will is just infinitely more interesting - to me  at least - than whatever blood omen was originally going for  although there are some really cool things in blood omen like the william the just   nemesis altered timeline that i really dig. going back in time to alter history in order to save the world from a tyrant only to create one even worse is a great concept  and of prescient today...
@mr. p yeah  same story with me. played soul reaver on the dreamcast not even realising there was a previous game  fell in love with soul reaver  loved soul reaver 2 even more when it came out and  due to soul reaver 2 s time travel heavy plot involving events of blood omen  i sought out a ps1 copy to finally play on my ps2.i was kind of disappointed  to tell you the truth. not that it was a bad game  but it just didn t seem anywhere near the level of soul reaver in terms of the themes it was trying to explore. blood omen is basically  wouldn t it be cool to play as an evil vampire in a tolkein-esque fantasy world with lots of occult practices and symbolism  there s some good stuff in there about manipulation and different types of evil existing  how something fighting evil isn t necessarily good  but rather just another faction of evil competing for power etc  but it s just not nearly as impressive as the exploration   refutation of nietzchean philosophy that the later games became.
cd tr is garbage  terrible take.
@mr mxyzptlk as tomb raider games they re garbage. as mac says in the video  they re fine games in their own right  even if their story makes no sense  but they re not tomb raider.cd tr being garbage tr is essentially the entire take of this video.
@jade runner 2049  why  because they don t have dated gameplay  they pushed the series forward and have high acclaim across the board amongst tr fans. and what doesn t make sense about the story  the same video that shat on soul reaver  not exactly a valid point.
but they don t have acclaim across the board among tr fans. half the tr fanbase dislike the cd tomb raiders. so that s just incorrect.i ll be honest  i was never a big tomb raider fan to begin with  though i ve played most of the old ones and all the new ones  and even as a casual-at-best  fan  i can see how watered down the new ones are in terms of gameplay. the  puzzles  are almost laughable in their simplicity. the old tomb raider puzzles would have 4 or 5 layers to them  in order to solve the entire thing you d have to solve each part separately  usually in a specific order. the new tr puzzles consist of one very simplistic puzzle that takes a few minutes to solve at most. and if you are having difficulty solving it  just hit ls l3 and the solution will be highlighted in an orange glow. sure  combat is more robust in the new ones  but that s kind of the point. they ve turned tr into a third person shooter with minor puzzle solving sections that simply serve as short obstacles between shooting sections.and that s not even getting to the narrative. as i say  i was never a huge fan of tomb raider  but even i can see that this new lara croft bears little to no resemblance to the original character. the original character was fun  sassy  enjoyed her work and was hunting treasure for glory  not some philanthropic desire to return artifacts to their  rightful owners.  she was much closer to a hot female version of nathan drake  which is probably because nathan drake was partly inspired by lara croft   in that she would start out in pursuit of treasure for selfish reasons but would discover world-ending plots on the way and reluctantly decide to do the right thing  as opposed to the selfless do-gooder the new one is.as for the narrative not making sense  maybe that s the wrong way of putting it - what i mean is that the 3 games are presented as a trilogy with an overarching narrative  but if you actually analyse the plots of all three  the connection between them is tenuous at best. and what s more  the writing is just unbelievably predictable.when i played tr 2013 and early on we discover that island is under the spell of a japanese goddess  and that over the centuries the denizens of the island have tried to perform a ritual to allow the goddess to possess the body of a woman etc etc  and then the bad guys of the game kidnap the female japanese-american member of the group  i just assumed immediately that they were going to use her in the next ritual under the logic that  as a woman of japanese ancestry  the ritual might have a better chance of succeeding with her.i assumed this because it was blatantly bloody obvious  and i assumed that lara and the rest of the cast understood all of this as well. it didn t even occur to me that this was supposed to be some sort of  surprise twist  because i assumed all the characters had already worked it out for themselves - being that it was blatantly obvious.then towards the end when it s  revealed  what the bad guys have planned  and lara acts shocked like it was some sort of amazing twist out of left field... i was literally yelling at my screen  are you f   ing kidding me ! that was meant to be a surprise ! yeah  for all the awards those games get for their narrative  i really don t get it. i can only assume they re being rewarded for all the woke elements each game contains - shadow  for instance  has the most laughable mary sue type character i ve ever seen  she is the village leader  the law enforcer  the mechanic  the hunter  and a bunch of other things all at once  and she has the body of a skinny teenage college student. i was literally laughing out loud when they rattled off the list of everything she is.but hey  all of that is just my opinion. if you like them  you like them  i m not trying to take anything away from you. as i say  i was never a huge fan of the originals but for different reasons. but i ll give the new ones this  they didn t romanticise the soviet union in rise like so many other games have been doing  so there s that.
@jade runner 2049  they do  this can be googled. it s acclaim and success is proof of that. the reason the old games didn t sell is because they re boring and they re very of their time. it s dated  new tr had puzzles but also did what it was always meant to be like you said. an action adventure involving ancient myths and tombs ofc. and there s nothing wrong with the storyline whatsoever  because you re able to predict it means nothing. you can say that about multiple beloved films and games   i knew that was gonna happen  unless it s blatantly obvious to most which it wasn t for me and many others who enjoyed the story  then it s not an issue.
lolsoul reaver   soul reaver 2 and it s not even debatable.
@danny dimes  soul reaver was the better game. soul reaver 2 was the better story.although  as a direct sequel  soul reaver 2 s story relies on the existence of soul reaver  so i guess you can t say it was  better  than it in that sense.
@danny dimes  it certainly is debatable  because if you go on any lok fan forum or reddit half the threads will be people debating exactly that.  i loved soul reaver but soul reaver 2 blew me away. it s subjective but the experience i had with soul reaver 2 was far more impactful than 1. soul reaver 2 just resonated with me in deeper way. maybe it s because i m a lover of time-travel fiction. regardless  thanks for proving my point that these are the things lok fans argue about.
@jade runner 2049  i certainly don t want to contradict the opinion of reddit when it comes to video games.
@helen hunt s forehead  soul reaver was borderline with the story and acting  but the sequels went overboard with it and are pretty much responsible imo for all the movie games we have to endure today that are 99  story.
@danny dimes at that time videogame stories and  acting  were largely embarrassing  and yes soul reaver 2 was a pioneer in videogame developers taking their writing and acting seriously  so what you hate about soul reaver 2 is precisely what i love about it. if a game is going to have a story  why wouldn t you want it to be good  if a game is going to have voice acting in it  why wouldn t you want the acting to be the best it can be the problem today is that so many developers have gone to the complete opposite extreme where they think they re making movies and treating the actual gameplay as an afterthought. you can argue that s what soul reaver 2 was but at the time that was a novelty aimed at niche gamers and the developers never pretended it was something else. everyone who played the soul reaver series knew they were going into a game where story was given at least equal attention as gameplay. very unfair to blame it for the situation we re in now.as long as the story doesn t detract from the gameplay i don t see what is wrong about making the story as good as it can be. a perfect example of a game series that does it right is yakuza. each yakuza game has about 10 hours worth of cutscenes with hbo level dialogue  acting and cinematography. they ve also each got 100  hours of incredibly rich  layered and fun gameplay involving combat  exploration  and a near endless amount of mini-games. the cutscenes are all skippable so those who don t care about the story can just get right into the gameplay  and gameplay segments are so long you never feel like you re being bombarded or having to mash the  skip  button.instead of having you constantly switching from gameplay to cutscene and back every 5 minutes the yakuza games give you a 2 hour segment of non-stop gameplay and then a single 10 minute long cutscene  followed by another 2  hours of gameplay. the way that series handles it is perfect.
@danny dimes lol i am no fan of reddit or the people that tend to use it. was merely using them as one example among many.
@danny dimes fyi i ve tried several times to post here my true thoughts on reddit but the yt aigorithm keeps shadow removing it.
@danny dimes it just occurred to me  but you ve kind of proven my initial point. it sounds like you re not actually a legacy of kain fan  away.blood omen was just as story heavy as soul reaver  so i can t see how someone could be a fan of that game whilst opposing story in videogames in general. i especially can t see how someone can defend blood omen while shltting on soul reaver on the grounds that the later games had  too much story.
@danny dimes  soul reaver 2 - or defiance for that matter - were nothing like the  interactive movies masquerading as games  that a lot of developers are churning out today. they were more story-driven than most games at the time but there were huge sections of gameplay  puzzle solving and combat across all of them. defiance especially made extra effort its combat  it just didn t execute it very well  using  quarter circle  type thumbstick inputs instead of combos  for instance  i don t know what they were thinking .
@helen hunt s forehead  my point is they paved the way for all the qte movies we endure today. too much talking  too many cinematics  too much deep important story prioritized over gameplay. and none of the sequels were anything like blood omen.
@jade runner 2049  blood omen had nowhere near as much story as the soul reaver sequels. voice acting was a mistake and we need to roll it back to snes times where everything had a dialogue box.
@danny dimes there are literally no qte movies - or qte events of any kind  for that matter - in the legacy of kain series. at all. at any point. while i agree with you there are games that take it way too far  the order  for instance   it sounds like you don t like any kind of story in a videogame at all. you aren t just talking about games like the order or various walking simulators  you re talking about any and every game that puts an effort into its story... i just can t even relate to that mindset.if you resent any kind of artistry in games and want games to go back to being time-fillers with zero narrative merit  there s a platform for you. nintendo switch. most nintendo games have little to no story  and the ones that do treat story as an afterthought. if you don t like games that make an effort with their story  why are you playing them when there are thousands of games that don t  why would you torture yourself playing games that don t suit your tastes when there are countless games being made that do seems weird  tbh.for me  i ve always considered the story to be part of the gameplay experience  unless it s a game where the gameplay is so god damn good like doom . they re not two separate things to me. it s only a problem when it s taken too far.but blaming soul reaver for the ones that take it too far is ridiculous. soul reaver 1   2 had huge sections of gameplay  combat  puzzle solving and platforming. to blame them for qt events  when they had precisely zero in them  or interactive movies masquerading as games today is absurd.
@danny dimes as for none of the sequels being anything like blood omen - yeah  no s  t  blood omen was a top-down scroller a la pokemon because the technology didn t exist at the time for the developers to do a fully realized 3d world. that s like trashing modern final fantasy for being a different gameplay genre to the old ones.but blood omen was every bit as story intensive as the later games. you re contradicting yourself  you re saying on the one hand the later games sucked because they had too much story and not enough gameplay  but on the other you re saying they suck because they re a departure from the original even though the original had the same balance of story and gameplay. that makes no sense.have you actually played blood omen  the main driving force behind it was its story. that s the main reason players were motivated to complete it. you re making it seem like blood omen was this hardcore gameplay focused videogame that treated its story as an afterthought  and then crystal dynamics took over the series and made the rest of the games  interactive movies.  nothing about that narrative is remotely true. blood omen was always just as story driven as the later games and the later games were not interactive movies. i seriously don t even get where you re coming from.
@danny dimes  blood omen had nowhere near as much story as the soul reaver sequels what are you even talking about  yes  it did. it had an insane amount of fmv cutscenes and the only reason it didn t have more was because of how much space these took up on a disc. consequently  a lot of the story takes place with in-game dialogue - a lot of it. blood omen was noted at the time gor being one of the most story-intensive games on the ps1. i m not even going to attempt to summarise the plot here because i would be here a day  but it s a tolkein-esque world of dozens of factions  political manipulation and sword and sorcery magic. to say it didn t have as much story as the later games is absurd.you re literally just rewriting history at this point. voice acting was a mistake... blood omen had voice acting.  not only that  it had really good voice acting for its time  noted for being one of the first games to take voice acting seriously. not only that  most of the voice actors in blood omen are the same voice actors throughout the rest of the series  simon templeman  anna gunn  tony jay etc. all returned to voice their characters in soul reaver and beyond  in the case of tony jay  he returned to voice a different character .again  your argument is making less and less sense. ...and we need to roll it back to the snes times where everything had a dialogue box. ok  you ve gone way off the deep end lol. there s no point me even attempting to reason with you when that s your position. but i will point out this  dialogue boxes are still dialogue. that s still story. it s just being told in a much less sophisticated manner. you started off this discussion from a position of opposing all forms of story in videogames. now you re defending voiceless dialogue boxes of text as what we should  go back to  - even though that dialogue boxes aren t any less story intensive as voiced dialogue. nothing about your argument makes any sense.some of voiceless dialogue box games of the past were even more story intensive than games today. final fantasy 7 s story was gargantuan and half the game was spent reading dialogue boxes  if one cared enough to read them .so what are you saying  exactly  mashing a button to skip dialogue boxes of text was more enjoyable than mashing a button to skip cinematic cutscenes  literally no sense.
i couldn t imagine how lara croft from those games will eventually become the classic version as she ages up.
the key thing here is  these are  soul reaver  fans saying this. those who prefer the first game know that the second game feels very different to the first    it does not have the same magic of the first with its fascinating world and detailed lore that clearly denis dyack put a lot of effort into building. it s fine if people love soul reaver but they absolutely made it not similar to the first  and crystal have also made tomb raider unrecognisable and alienated fans now.re legacy of kain  melonie literally has a quote from the creator denis dyack saying it s basically watered down what he eatablished.i don t even need to make an argument  it s literally there in black and white. crystal mangled the ip into their own thing  which they have a track record of doing
@kala2k7 no he didn t. he said what cd hennig did with it was so different and alien compared to what he had in mind that he can t compare the two. that s very different to saying that they just took his idea and  watered it down.   almost the opposite  in fact.again  to say they  mangled  it into something else is to imply that what they produced is objectively inferior and uglier. i don t need to make an argument  that s just demonstrably false.but you make my point for me when you say cd have alienated the original tomb raider fanbase. there wasn t a legacy of kain fanbase to alienate at the time they released soul reaver. you are literally the first person i ve ever encountered who preferred pre-soul reaver lok over what came after. again  i ve played all of them  and while blood omen is a fine game  imo it s not on the same level as soul reaver lok. it s a kind of goofy  play as the bad guy  game that s  edgy  for the sake of being edgy. i much prefer the philosophical exploration of fate vs free will that was the later games.i m also pretty sure it wasn t cd s decision to take it over  either. i m pretty sure they were making another game before eidos pulled them off it and made them do a sequel to blood omen  so blame eidos if you re going to blame anyone.
@kala2k7 also  and this might sound a little out there  but some people have commented in the past that blood omen is actually pushing satanic and occult themes and ideas. not saying i m one of these people  but the game literally starts out with a quote from alastair crowley  and many of the names of characters and places come from real life occult works.when you add onto to that that one of the 3 creators was convicted for cp  there s a fairly compelling case that blood omen was literally a satanic game. i m not religious  but i know melonie mac is  so it s kind of weird hearing her defend such a game.again  i know that s bordering on a little wacky. just saying  there is an argument for it even if i don t necessarily agree with it. maybe the game was actually anti-satan and the creator possessing cp is an unrelated coincidence.
@jade runner 2049    he did say it s  diluted  and gone in a different direction. diluted means watered down! so yes denis dyack the creator of legacy of kain did say that about what happened to lok.i say mangled because they turned it into something it was never intended to be according to the very guy who created the ip!this isn t a debate about which game is better  i m not telling you that you should think x gane us better  it s that crystal took over and made it something it was never meant to be as per denis.silicon knights alleged that crystal used underhanded tactics and did a ton of problematic things  it s all in the silicon knights vs crystal dynamics lawsuit document  and crystal settled out of court  rather than fight the claims in court  inplying there may have been merit to the claims
@jade runner 2049  she s not defending the contents of the game  she s making a case that crystal dynamics have a history of hijacking franchises and totally changing them - and that it s not just with tomb raider - by providing evidence with the statements by denis dyack
@kala2k7  didn t know that about the court documents. i always thought it was eidos s doing. if true then i take that back.but his claim of  dilution  doesn t make sense  then. how can it be both a totally alien and different thing to his vision but also be a  watered down version   i take your point that this isn t about which is better  but about what occurred. i guess it just sounded to me like mac was claiming the post-blood omen games were automatically and necessarily inferior bad compared to the blood omen creators  original vision. it also sounded like melonie mac has never actually played any lok games and was making some incorrect assumptions about it  and some incorrect assumptions about its fanbase.i guess two things can be true at once  it could be true that cd appropriated and cannibalised someone else s game and also true that what they produced was better than the original creator s vision  which in turn is going to be subjective by its very nature . if that s the contention then i guess i don t have a problem.i ve never been a fan of cd themselves  whatever respect i had for them was out of admiration for amy hennig.ironically  cd ended up doing a similar thing to hennig as they did to dyack  they gave blood omen 2 to a different team of writers who took the story in a completely different direction to hennig s vision - and that one did upset the fanbase lol. i actually like blood omen 2 for what it is  but it s definitely the weakest of the series and nowhere near the level of writing as the rest.hennig ended up having to fix elements of blood omen 2 s story in the subsequent game  defiance. her salvage job worked out quite well  but the fact she had to do it says a lot about cd s management  or lack thereof .years later cd would do the same thing again  handing the series to a team to create the cancelled legacy of kain  dead sun. by all accounts this game was going to be an even further  radical departure from everything that came before  and one of the lead writers openly stated in a meeting that both blood omen and soul reaver  sucked   which is a great attitude to have when you re taking over an existing series.
@kala2k7 yeah  i take your point.  we re arguing about different things. and thinking about it  cd do actually have a pattern of this with later games in the same legacy of kain series  blood omen 2 and dead sun. i m just a die-hard soul reaver and hennig era lok fanatic and those games were a huge part of my childhood. got me through some tough times and even forged some real life friendships over them. i m going to get defensive over them whenever anyone takes shots at them  and it came across like melonie mac was saying they shouldn t exist  or something.it also seemed like she s making some incorrect assumptions about lok and its fanbase based on the parallels between its development and tomb raider. there s statistically zero legacy of kain fans who wish soul reaver and its subsequent games never happened. no lok fans are upset that dyack and the other creators never got to implement their original vision. statistically 100  of lok fans became fans because of soul reaver  not in spite of it. this is very different from the situation with tomb raider  where the fanbase is now divided almost down the middle and most og tomb raider fans hate the new ones. i m repeating myself. wider incorrect assumptions aside  the point about cd having a pattern of taking other people s games is valid - even if i do love some of those games they made.
@jade runner 2049   @jade runner 2049  well these are denis s words  but i think things can be watered down and very different  things can be taken in a different direction whilst being a simplified versionyeah that s all subjective on if what came after is better  but the lok creator definitely feels what they did with it is very different to what he had plannedi didn t know that about hennig! thank you for the info cause it s fascinating. i do know they did her dirty though  cause she wanted to work on tomb raider  but they wouldn t let her  and she then went off to create uncharted  an extremely succesful franchise. and crystal would go on to copy uncharted with their 2013 reboot trilogy lmaodead sun looked so weird! like how is that a legacy of kain game lol. i would probably say that is another example of wanting to have a very different game  probably just based on trends at the time  and slap an existing brand name on it  in this case legacy of kain.are you serious   omg that is hilarious  not that they said that  that s horrible  but literally for interviews for the 2013 tomb raider reboot trilogy they would go on to criticise the prior lara croft.. basically the implication that they were  fixing  her. the fact they did that with lok too is mind blowing
@kala2k7 yeah man! apparently the dead sun team would mock the previous games in the series - dyack s and hennig s - for their  pretentious dialogue.  i can t remember the actual quote  but they gave a mocking example of the kind of dialogue that would occur in the existing games  and then fans pointed out that the example they gave never actually occurred in the entire series!i didn t know hennig wanted to work on tomb raider! i dare say it would have been a better result than what they ended up with if she had!and now it makes perfect sense that her next game was a swashbuckling treasure hunting game. how ironic that cd ended up copying uncharted! i always said nathan drake was like a male version of og lara croft  now i know why.
@kala2k7 i will also say this  while i love hennig s legacy of kain games and will always prefer them to dyack s original vision  i just learned that dyack was on the right side of gamergate  which earns him massive respect in my eyes.
i found that the legend trilogy was that happy medium between classic ps1 tr games and the modern controls of today s games and unlike the remakes the main objectives in legends you  were still exploring tombs.
netflix  amazon  jj abrams  kathleen kennedy  electronic arts and the cleopatra creators should unite and create the ultimate woke simulator
tomb raider  rings of power
i hope they make a more old-school tomb raider someday.  i didn t even mind up through the angelina jolie era.  then.... i dunno.
lara croft will probably be black in the next game since the new trend is blackwashing english characters real life people or solf lesbian like aloy now. i have zero hope we ll see our classic badass lara again. cd already sold their soul to the woke.
14 47 completely wrong. soul reaver gave the character  kain  a lore and a point first in the first place.in blood omen1 the character  kain  is simply without a point and without a definition.reminder kain is the adventurer who searches for the elder god and incurs the elder god s wrath in the process. kain is a well-rounded character in amy hennig s story.in blood omen1 you don t understand why no rpg was made here  i.e. why is the player not allowed to choose the sex and name etc. of the protagonist himself overall  the story of blood omen1 is completely incomprehensible  and it s only in soul reaver2 where kain tells the story of blood omen1 as background lore that i find this interesting.at first amy hennig told interesting vampire stories.in blood omen1  kain  is not a vampire at all  but a magician  but not like in skyrim  but in completely clumsy.
i never understand how corporations can take an established franchise and completely ruin it... and i m pretty sure amazon would have woked tomb raider to death.
unbelievable. as a lifelong tomb raider fan since 1996  i cannot believe this is where we are... while i did not hate the first survivor game  the promise and the story fell apart by the end of rise and the less said about shadow the better. crystal dynamics is a very troubled company culturally - the nadir of corporate and committee think  putting group think beliefs before practical common sense strategies for their ips. the equivalent of   if we don t look or listen to reality  then it won t affect us and we can just live in our dreamworld.
lara was last seen in the last revelation  with hints in chronicles. what we have seen since then is very pc larp ing using the name to draw people in. sadly  all you have now are activists first and game designers second.
that does come as surprise. i guess the mother of all duds ringsnof power actually resulted in a company shift at amazon...the writer s strike may have contributed too.
the 3 franchises i wish had more games being made with the original feel are tomb raider  prince of persia and jak and daxter  each one of these had games that were awesome. sadly pop and jak and daxter made some pretty meh sequels and as for tomb raider i took a long time to actually get the reboot bc when i saw how many reaction commands constantly popped up on screen and being too full of cutscenes i just didn t find it appealing
i m currently playing through tomb raider  definitive edition on my ps5  and it s great. i m catching myself exploring for collectibles and raiding optional tombs frequently.i m very excited to jump into rise of the tomb raider after this.

i d love to see lara croft comes to meet the sad hopeless old pathetic dr. indiana jones  because she has a new project  for example she found hints to the location of atlantis  and she needs his archaeological expertise  indy doesn t have interest or passion to go adventuring again but lara keeps pursuing him and encouraging him. indy then gets annoyed and asks her  why are you keep bothering me  just find other archaeologist!  lara answers   because you are highly recommended to me by someone!  indy says    by whom !   me ..   says a shadowy man who is suddenly coming behind lara to face indy. indy is stunned  he sees this man and slowly starting to recognize him.  aren t you ... short round   the man jumps to hug indy and says   yes  indy  it s me!  while lara just stands there watching them embracing each other with tears on her eyes.
at the end of the lake to celebrate
that s not lara croft. she should be almost an anti-hero. not necessary bad but out for herself  primarily. we should be able to do things in games that we wouldn t do in real life. to be a thief  or an assassin or a tomb raider.  vampire or batman.  you look great and i always like to see your videos. thank you
why amazon walked away in 6 words  rings of power  wheel of time. amazon has sunk billions into 2 failed tv series and are not going to throw more money away on a bad tomb raider adaptation. and in the current climate  leaving lara on the shelf is the best thing for her. otherwise she ll end up on an island somewhere drinking green milk and being needy broken cat lady.
it is  strange  dat were all are agree on lara crott games
actually started tomb raider with legend and anniversary. went back and played the originals and had a good if somewhat frustrating time in parts. who ever is working on tomb raider now should at least watch let s plays of tomb raider 1-4 at a minimum. that s about the only way they can start to understand the franchise.
i  for  god  dat lara crott didn t  have a woman   and  he answer my prayer thanks for the video i love it awesome video i in joy it good job have a good day and night
i wouldn t touch anything by someone named abrams
agreed  soul reaver pretty much made the legacy of kain series what it is.if it wasn t for soul reaver and its sequel  we wouldn t even be talking about legacy of kain let alone blood omen 1.it s kind of like the reverse of what happened to paper mario.
you re objectively wrong about your bo1 summary. kain was explicitly a vampire and the elder god didn t even exist in that game. kain is murdered and brought back to life by mortanius as a vampire  though kain admitted he hadn t considered the cost of being brought back.he is also explicitly called  vampire  by ariel at the pillars when he first arrives. she s the one that sends him on the quest to eliminate the other members of the circle of nine under the pretense that he would be cured if he finished eliminating them all. only at the end does he find out he was the final member as the balance pillar. the story wasn t exactly obtuse on this stuff. even the soul reaver itself was introduced in blood omen and was the ultimate weapon you get.i agree sr was a huge improvement and sr2 helped flesh out the lore more  but to say kain was never a vampire but a magician or that the story was incomprehensible is just false.https   legacyofkain-archive.fandom.com wiki blood_omen _legacy_of_kain transcript
@mr. p   explicitly a vampire sr1 explains for the first time what  explicitly a vampire  is. brought back to life in bo1 kain is just an undead magician.see for example diablo2  there you can also summon an undead mage as a necromancer.see for example gothic3 there you can also turn into a wolf  into a mosquito  ect.
@tottokamm   the world had changed to my eyes. i had not expected such cruelty from the light. for in the embrace of the sun  i could find no comfort  only malice. this would change in time for the worse  along with other things. weakness to sunlight. this was where the bloody deed of my murder took place. i would not be kind to the denizens that lurk here. they would taste my steel  and i their blood. the necromancer had offered me no warning as to what my resurrection would entail  and yet i must confess  in my haste  i had not sought one. was his gift a curse  i would seek the pillars for an answer. he defeats his enemies and drinks their blood for sustenance. another standard vampire trait. he also later has the ability to turn into a bat  and i think a wolf and mist. again  vampire lore.kain 	keep your distance or i ll send you back to hell  spirit!ariel 	there is nothing left of me to fear vampire. i am only a shadow of my former self... ariel   the balance of the circle of nine. even so  i can provide the answers you seek.ariel calls him a vampire to his face. numerous other characters call him a vampire. nowhere in the game or series is kain called a  magician . he was a petty nobleman  ariel s words  that was cursed to be a vampire upon his resurrection by mortanius as one of the undead.also  it s irrelevant what other games do. the lore of blood omen 1  even taken by itself  says kain is a vampire over and over again. i m going by the words of the script itself. where in this game or any of the other lok series is kain said to be an  undead magician
@mr. p  this is a vampire - belongs to someone- belongs to a clan or founds his clan- the soul remains in the undead corpse which pisses off the elder god- absorbs blood and abilities  and side effects  from other humans or other monsters-  ect.all this tells amy hennig or vampire  the masquerade or blade 1998but not bo1.in bo1  kain does not absorb abilities  only finds spells  but does not cast spells with his body.in bo1 kain is the only  vampire   so ariel calls him that  but acktually kain in bo1 is just a canibal like in fallout4 etc. where you can heal life energy by drinking human flesh and blood.
@mr. p  yes this tells you chatgpt or another a.i. with text sources from the internet.but as a player i feel kain in bo1 not as a vampire  but as a magician from witcher3 or a cannibal from fallout4.reminder killing the guardians of the pillars doesn t give kain a new ability.instead kain in bo1 finds new spells like a magician.
@mr. p  a vampire is the metaphor for someone who does not contribute to the aztec infrastructure but only parasitizes the infrastructure. gross  someone who benefits from wealth but does not contribute to it.vampires don t exist in reality  they re just a theoretical consideration  a folk belief  a mythology about what s blocking the elder god  what s blocking the gothic main story.amy hennig s story is explicitly about this myth.it is also questioned whether the elder god is not the parasite that blocks the vampires and forces a life of human sacrifice on the vampires.google  did vampires really exist  yes there was in reality bo1 kain.for example the cannibal of rothemburgand there is also magic  i.e. human overstrain to understand causality.kain in bo1 could be a historical person  so kain in bo1 can t be a vampire  is not one.

well  that s a relief  but who gets to publish them i don t know microsoft you re missing exclusive right now. maybe you should give it a shot again just don t fuck it up.
blood omen1 is a very bad example because this game was a complete flop and remained unknown  and is given away for free so doesn t belong to anyone today  and in 1997 computer games weren t established.it s exactly the opposite soul reaver1 was my very first computer game ever  which i liked and fascinated me  one of my top 10 games today  alongside days gone  fallout3  skyrim  etc.without soul reaver1 computer games would probably not be a hobby of mine at all.soul reaver1 banged the table that computer games are there for gothic.you can t tell gothic with films.soul reaver1 is the forefather of all open world gothic adventure computer games that i play and love.
this   the current indiana jones disaster reminds me of a crossover fan fic i read over a decade ago  story was simply put lara croft and indiana jones competing against each other to recover aquire various artefacts and relics  it was as cringe as a fan fic can be  but from what i remember from it  it still sounded better than current hollywood.
kathleen kennedy perfected the art of incoherent trilogies.
amazon better not mess up the fallout tv series.
doomed raider
totally get your reaction as the die-hard tomb raider that you are. . . .keep going strong  melonie mac! go boom!
we should do a crowd funding project and make our own tomb raider film with mel as the director
amazon saw how bad phoebe dbag was doing with the indy 5  movie reviews and pre-emptively dumped her project.
blood omen legacy of kain is my favorite game of all time. it has the best writing and va even to this day. nothing comes close.
i don t see the issue. this is a w...
soul reaver is better
i never planned on buying this game if the rumors were true.  the lgbqt is touching stuff that should never be missed in the beginning.
tbh i still have no hopes for tr franchise whether if its in amazon s hand or not. the problem lies in crystal dynamics itself. they ruined one of the most iconic characters in the world and even wrecked the avengers games to bits. all characters look like they are budget cosplayers with nothing that makes them cool or badass. their appearance are weak  their dialogues are cringey. if they don t get away from making the game  relatable    realistic  then its definitely going to go down. games are meant to give experience that we as humans never get in our day to day lives. let us feel powerful and feel like we can overcome any hardships through the characters we play as. being sexy means you are confident in who you are  that makes it so appealing and makes us to actually work out and get better physically and mentally. these things shouldn t be said because it falls under the common sense category which sadly western entertainment industry has completely forgot.
maybe there is hope for tomb raider after all.
as a sonic fan tomb raider fans have my sympathies and prayer that the tomb raider series can get better from this
come on sony buy your girl back
this november it s gonna be 15 years since the last tomb raider game released  time flies.
i like you standing up!
so true  i want classic tr back
i have a question about tomb raideri m thinking about playing the original games but considering its current state i want to where i should stop playing. i assume it s around 3 or angel of darkness. i m asking you because you re an expert so i wanted to know your opinion
fallen through unexpectedly ... meaning  once the failure of the rings of power was realized.
all i want is a good port of the classic games. while i do like angel of darkness  it did start tomb raider s decline.
well  good news the franchise isn t milked to death like star wars  as it should.
didn t they already remake tomb raider
it is kinda disappointing  but yeah  amazon has been a bit hit or miss. so it could be a silver lining  but also more disappointment for tomb raider fans generally. i do hope something good will happen for the classic fans  but that is just my optimism.
what does she have against sitting tho !
you really need to get over the changes to tomb raider since the originals. steam reviews tomb raider 2013 - overwhelmingly positiverise of the tomb raider - very positiveshadow of the tomb raider - very positivenot everyone is on board with your opinion that they suck.i only say this because you always bring up your negative opinion about the last three tomb raiders and you sound like a broken record.other than that  i love your channel and your openness with controversial subjects  so i am not one of your haters.
the tomb raider reboots aren t too bad- but they read more like the adventures of nathan drake s daughter than a tomb raider game
kwasade against the algorithm !!!
11 04 i played the first blood omen after defiance  and although i appreciate the dark tones and story  i probably would have never heard of legacy of kain  until years later if it remained a diablo clone. if crystal dynamics wants to make a new game  i would prefer a reboot  starting with the first blood omen  but as a souls  or zelda clone.  which is basically the same thing.  in my personal opinion  amy hennig screwed up the story  she tried to make kain good and defiance s ending left no room for sequels.
super early video.   must be about tomb raider.  yep.  nice.
sonic the fast food place  or sonic the sega character  either way what do either of those have to do with tr
@el gato felix  sonic the hedgehog. sonic has a notorious history of countless failures until it finally gained some redemption through the movies and frontiers. i kinda see a similarity here with the reboot being mid and the constant character assassination of modern day croft.
considering embracer owns the lotr rights they probably don t want another bad show from amazon with their ip properties.
anniversary was fun. i d rather we get graphically updated versions of the old core games rather than new stories because current year just isn t capable.
she doesn t want to sit down all day. and she doesn t want to be fat.
they don t need lora croft  they have guyladriel that will carry the flame riches and greatness for them.
the 2013 game was fantastic  the next game was okay and i didn t even play the last game.
hmmmmm  i wonder why
angel of darkness is actually a truly great game if you can look past the controls and loading.. the levels themselves are incredible..
melonie rich  review tech usa keeps calling you a liar i would love for you to go on his show anc clear the air he is angry and  confused! if you don t i understand because i would rather ignore him!
i would like a traditional movie company take her ip over.  she is like conan. not a woke character. i could see a good independent and make a low budget movie heavy on stunts like bar room brawls type and still be good.  see laura deck someone would be fun  yes unrealistic - maybe she could use something heavy lol
few enjoy dissing their favorite franchises going down the wrong path... we d rather just enjoy it remaining on the right path. sometimes itbis necessary  though.
i have the feeling once the activision blizzard deal is approved and closed that microsoft is trying to buy crystal dynamics and eidos along side all of the ip s including tomb raider back into the studios under xbox.reason why   crystal dynamics is currently working on the perfect dark game with one of xbox aaa studios which means that the the potential buyout has been predicted and microsoft and embracer groups talking about this in the background for quite a while now.amazon gaming as we know is simply not competent in the gaming space  let alone developing a full aaa game.
bezos amazon  we have billions we can spend on shows and movies and games ! ! fans  too bad you suck at making  writing  producing shows and movies and games...
i like to believe the budlight fiasco has put the fear in some of these companies
i liked the new tomb raider.. classic was garbage..
soul reaver was amazing though .
they are making lara gay and respecting artifacts  well least its not relic jars of pronouns or something  ancient pronoun tablet  shes already a badass woman tho  just leave it at that and do a story around her and what she does and what the fans expect    so stupid. turning a possible role model into a woke gimmick then in the future moan at the lack of strong female role models lol.
i didn t mind the legends series too much and i actually love her design in that the most  but an old school tomb raider with a sort of open world style would be super fun  i think!
i think you should look into legacy of kain as a whole though
in defense of amazon  they re already throwing a couple billion away with their awful rings show.  this is essentially throwing away money too.  because it would go the woke route.
the only difference between tomb raider and legacy of kain with slapping that title on it is soul reaver is fantastic
melonie  if you look not only tomb raider  need for speed games went into woke crap too. what happened in making great story gameplay games. we need old lara croft return   and need for speed to return to their roots of underground 1 and 2 vibes. cuz so tired of woke versions nobody asked.. hope they realise this and make something good  but i doubt they re gonna hear what fans want. they dont care sh t about what we want  is all what they want and represantion crap. i miss the old days of good amazing games we had.
only thing real is if it doesn t say core. it won t be what we want really.
i don t think melonie will do that. he s been saying dumb things about melonie for a long time. but who knows.
so you re bad at video games  gotcha
i m imagining one day i m going to wake up to a trailer and it s going to core development. like waking up one morning and seeing team  silent.
to be fair i really enjoyed tomb raider and rise of the tomb raider i did miss the old puzzle solving though and jonah is a annoying as hell.....but i could really do without a tv show it would hurt itself doing it as writers would fill in the gaps with gender racial politics a movie would be nice but please not phoebe waller-bridge she is no lara physically just a crazy cat lady feminist who thinks she s a comedian.
imo legends was the last good tomb raider game. reboot was ok  but the lara croft soul was killed with a .45 acp in that game.
hot damn  glad i passed on working for crystal dynamics lol
i loved the original legacy of kane when it came out as a third person none rpg  i hated that version
this is a great thing. it s been saved not dropped
i dream too much outside of reality
@melonie hey i ve been gaming for 32 years i love  tombraider. but i m going to disagree with you on the new trilogy. i really enjoyed those and the second is one of my favorite tombraider games! i feel tombraider never gets the love it deserves. this is bad news. lol time will tell!really good video. keep up the good work. god bless!
i hate disney   i hate amazon  i hate hulu . streaming platforms have 1 good show and 10000  trash woke shows .   the only reason i have amazon is for the boys that s it .
we see the same divide among star wars fans since the sequel trilogy. unlike with tomb raider  the star wars sequel trilogy stayed true to the look of the original trilogy. i thought the characters were great but the story was a mess.with tomb raider reboot  they changed lara into someone completely different. i enjoyed the games in of themselves but not as tomb raider games. miss the old lara.
i think they want embracer for the lord of the rings game rights  to go with their rings of power.
join us in zelda
just make a game that emphasizes exploration over  lara must level up her skills so she can fight a doomsday cult  bullcrap crystal dynamics gave us. and give us egypt! both uncharted and the modern-gen tr games failed to deliver what adventure-gamers want the most.
this can only be a good thing right    this gets tomb raider out of the hands of a company that had nothing but the worst intentions for it    at the very least wouldnt this put the kobash on the whole project  i d rather the franchise cease to exist  rather fall into the hands of shitlords that want to destroy or corrupt its legacy!
the rebooted tomb raider trilogy was so freaking awesome
i say nothing is lost  both companies would have screwed it up  so i rather have no lara then what ever activist wannabe freakshow. as one of the first franchises   fandoms to that was attacked  im still proud that we thr tomb raider fandom to the day of today  basiscly stopped supporting the franchise after the forced 2012 remakes.
couldja be a doll and tell xia i said sup
just do a proper port of the older tomb raider games and legacy of kain with achievements and filter settings and i will be happy
jackie malone
great video melonie!what amazon most needs is fewer billions flushed down jennifer salke s  development  toilet.  amazon succeeded at providing a huge internet marketplace providing reach to people and companies who created stuff.  that was their cash cow and content creation is their failure zone.  stick with your strengths and while it is okay and encouraged to experiment with new ideas  being a  loss leader  in so-called entertainment is not a path to success.  fire  em all and focus on your competencies.  and  as a part of that  quit spit-roasting ips that deserve so much better.  a lara croft trilogy that didn t make any sort of cohesive sense between individual elements that make up the trilogy and contradicted and cut-throat itself   oh  you mean the  force is female  new star wars trilogy effect   yeah  when morons are given authority to  create  it never goes anywhere good.  yeah  the original games were great fun.  i wouldn t have even minded if they had altered the stories so that perhaps lara was stealing them back from people who had stolen them  kind of like some of indy s episodes  recovering the ark from the german army or rescuing his dad from the castle.  what these  developers  are doing is similar to grave robbing  they re stealing active and cherished ips and turning them into something almost completely the antithesis of what they were to try to make them supposedly more appropriate.  like hiring some fourth wave feminist fascist puritanical bint whacktivist with crayons to  fix  rueben s paintings of nude women to suppress the male gaze  though obviously said . . . individual would just as likely be fine with rueben s nudes since they were  healthy weight  nudes .  i hate the  people are allowed to like what they like unless we disapprove  and we disapprove of almost everything  open-minded and tolerant mindset.  i remember rebelling against the moral majority overreach in the 80s  and they were nothing compared to today s left wing supported mussolinism.  ugh.
i just want a straightforward tomb raider game where lara is as beautiful and badass. is that so much to ask
so they let them go. i guess the  deals off. oh well maybe this is a sign of good things to come so let s  just injoy this w  and that s the classic look of tomb raider model after a certain actress. it s not you even though you re worked out and acrobat it  looked great sarcasm angelina jolie not the one from disney f    that company the last time i saw that look was underworld.
im more worried about planetside and dcuo who were supposed to get overhauls this year
they were working on getting a marvel contract at the initial purchase
welcome to you and the rest of us disillusioned fans of franchises ruined. they did my he man and witcher.
i really like that light up... tree  in the background. that s too bad about tomb raider. i never played the classic games and my introduction was the new reboot trilogy. while i enjoyed them  i grew up with classic lara as the face of tomb raider and i would like to see a return to that form because the new one is just...a cry baby basic beeetch. even though i never played the old ones  i could tell she was a cool action character  and it took them three full games to even get her to be somewhat competent in the new series. didn t even have dual pistols.
i love vampires too!
embracer made that game they tried to sell to us. saints row woke reboot. it got the boot part right.
hi melonie  as other friends in the comment section have said  maybe it was for the best.it is still very disapointing but better than to have some mediocre  agenda driven garbage fest.
lol that was quick. when was the last time amazon actually made a quality a title  can the rehash of tomb raider games piss off the original developers to make a new one. i think tomb raider 4 left laura trapped in the dungeon at the end. can we get a true sequel to that
i know the games havent been up to par with the old ones  but this sucks that the franchise could be pretty much dead even though it kind of already has been for years
embracer is a train wreck.
between amazon s failure of rings of power  and the fact that phoebe waller-bridge was attached to work on it  maybe it s best there not be a tomb raider show  another movie or game for it.  certainly not nowadays.
if they wait a few years  i guarantee you the woke insanity will be gone. then they can make it then.
amazon s tomb raider was being developed by phoebe waller bridge. so we dodged a bullet. actually  a hail of bullets.
lara sells regular relics to museums. my take was like batman  she keeps dangerous objects of power under lock and key. but sarcastic shades lara is def lara.
just 2bn nothing to worry about
sony needs to buy tomb raider. would it even be possible to reform the original core team members  i felt the legends trilogy was good  just a tech upgrade.
don t worry  netflix will be there to buy and make it even more terrible.
intended or unintended  soul reaver was one the best games and ips of its generation.
embracer is fucking doa
saving artifacts and returning them to their so-called rightful owners  that s not  tomb raider.  it s  tomb savior.
why are you standing  trying new style
i don t even dislike 2013 or rise. shadow was my stepping off point. that said  yeah...pretty sure whatever content they had planned for the near future was going to be garbage anyway.
i still had hope for the reboot when we got dual pistols in 2013. rise was an even better game imo  but what happened to the hard-won dual pistols ! it made no sense instead of an origin story explaining how an iconic character came to be  we diverged even farther from classic lara to the point that she was unrecognizable in shadow.i agree completely with melonie  whatever the reboot trilogy was  it wasn t tomb raider. if crystal had mimicked the successful formula found in last crusade  where we learn in an adrenaline-filled 15 minutes how indy got his hat  whip  chin scar and fear of snakes  the tomb raider reboot could have been something special. oh well.
so we can still hope it won t end up being some woke piece of garbage that nobody wants.
after how tomb raider has been absolutely destroyed and hit with the ugly feminist treatment  i d rather forget about tomb raider and lay it to rest. it s nothing like the amazing games i played on the ps1 as a kid!
the economy is going down hill so of course they would back out of a high risk project.
even though ps users were screwed on tr underworld by not getting the dlc  even today  it s still not available   i took a chance on the reboot and enjoyed most of it. then  they screwed us again by making us wait a year for rise. i said   eff that then.  completely ignored shadow. tomb raider is dead to me now. unless they completely reboot it again and don t change her from the original.
at 15 17. i love all 5 games in the legacy of kain series. that being said  between blood omen i   soul reaver i  not only the camera style  but the whole game play style changed dramatically. i miss  blood omen s ability to shift into a werewolf and just rip people s faces off. i think with blood omen 2   defiance  they spun a good tale. but if you go back to the original root of it  you can still see the scar  where c.d. grafted on a whole other branch that wasn t part of the original flower. just saying.
apple is doing a go job right now with is shows i wish they give it a shot.or and amc tomb raider that probably work  even hbo could do something good.....but not disney  dear lord  not disney!!!
the legacy of kain thing really sucks to hear. i loved that series. both the soul reaver games and of course legacy of kain.
comment for the algorithm
boggles my mind that embracer would make this news public. and  honestly  shouldn t a  classic  tomb raider adventure have been better to develop anyway
if you ask me i think it s better to put it out of its misery than to keep making one bad tomb raider game or movie or whatever. i think most people have just had it with hollywood s and the game industry s wokeness.
will you be doing a video about the playstation showcase
embracer  aren t they the company that owns many of the media rights for lotr  probably don t want another failure from amazon after the lotr show.
at 1st i was like wtf who cares it s just a game but i sorta get it. i do like a couple games and tomb raider irl tv is super hot.
i played these classics tomb raider n64007 n64.mario cart n64. to bad  they all going down hill.
hey  melonie i just want to say that amazon needs to stop ruining our beloved old school video game tomb raider franchise. also they need to just find some other things to do instead of creating a whole bunch of problems for tomb raider fans. anyway i m so angry that they are messing around with tomb raider video games and i do wish that they would find something else to do instead of making us tomb raider fans get angry with them for messing around with tomb raider video games. anyway that is all i have to say about this video for today and i hope you and everyone else agrees with me on it. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a great blessed evening and good nite melonie. also have a great week and weekend too. god bless you melonie.
lara probably won t be back until she packin meat in some tucking gruts
it s not a win  but it s not a loss either and at this rate we have to take what we can
please check your volume levels  very low imo
i bought all the reboot collector editions  the last one was  180 i think  but i will not be buying the collectors edition for the next tomb raider game.they would have to prove it s not a tomb  artifact  replacer game  and our original lara character model  style and attitude is back  then i ll think about spending money on another collectors edition.
i liked soul reaver games though. and all the nosgoth lore
storyline  lara croft returns a buddha statuette to afghanistan      and they crushed it with a sledgehammer.
this is a good thing. i d rather it be left alone than butchered.
i loved legend and underworld and anniversary i thought they were some of the better tr game angel of darkness was pure dogshit!  the issue with legend and underworld was the physics and they were very short but i thought they were still fine! come on! the latest reboots however yea they are dogshit!!
after indy 5 s dismal reception at the cannes film festival  they re probably decided against investigating. phoebe waller-bridge was on the writing team for both  and any vaguely switched on investor would be having serious doubts.
this is not a bad thing  it would been completely destroyed.
why do people hate the new tomb raider
the best channel for tomb raider updates and analysis.
amazon already has the most expensive flop in history with the  rings of power  garbage.  my bet is they are trying to cut their losses and don t want yet another disaster on their hands.
what  legacy of kain soul reaver is phenomenal  i don t get your hate for cd melonie. i mean you said you played rise multiple times. despite your opinion  they re great games and lara acts and looks great in them.
six years.  fans are also tired of games taking too long to make.  many are also tired of long games.  assassin s creed mirage is a response to long games.  lets see how that turns out.
commenting to feed the algorithm
i can t get over how much i enjoy standing melonie. like sitting mel was good  but standing mel is an absolute queen.
@meloniemacgoboom
these money data gouging vultures need to leave lara croft s original integrity alone  until the day a worthy game studio comes along to bring back the agile  gungfu globe totting adventurer that women wanted to be and men wanted to be with back in the 90s.
i need to light the candles and make sweet romance betwixt lara crofts ginormous talents
if we all keep holding the line and not show any attention or pay for any of this crap  they will keep losing money to the point that they will have to hire and leave the work back into the hands of passionate developers artists etc and we will get the good shit back.
melonie you should play lars croft in whatever tv series of movie they produce!
what s the point of a show if it s going to feel likle i m watching a gaming playthrough  the lasty movie just felt like a movie game
true fans of almost everything from the past couple decades have been having a hard time lol
whaaaaaa    lara croft didn t whine and pout throughout the entire original games and didn t say  jooonaaah  with a really whiney tone every 5 minutes
i think this a blessing in disguise. tomb raider needs to be adapted by a studio that does not have a woke message to push and actually portray lara croft as what she should be. sidenote  this makes me want to play tomb raider 2 on my ps2 though because a person i know loves that game and i would have to make sure it still works.
we should make our own tomb raider and call it  mausoleum invader  or  casket bandit  or something like that.
if we go to disney land and buy a mickey mouse doll  but they sell us a ricky rat doll instead... are we the problem
i love how you started  us tomb raider fans  no one is a fan of tomb raider!
get elon to buy it
as a gamer of over 20 years  one of the worse feeling is watching your video game heroes die in front of your eyes. the franchise i saw  pass away peacefully  was phantasy star online. there are other incarnations of the phantasy star franchise  but i feel nothing was more impactful franchises for the console side of the world of mmo gaming as far as the framework goes.for everything else  it s like watching the gaming world burn with greedy corporate shmucks at the helm that tries to get as much money from many people instead of focusing on what their target audience is.
yes! the best realistic scenario is to just shelve it  and remember lara as a hot ass kicking hero we didn t deserve.
bears
at this point i have no hope left for tomb raider. it would surprise me if they did do lara justice.
i think amazon studios is going to go belly-up. but this good news for tomb raider fans.
the last  and best installment was anniversary  circa 2007. legend and aod weren t bad. aod was very clunky and the execution was piss poor however.
honestly for the best. obviously classic lara is the best there is. but i actually also like reboot lara and she just kept getting worse in every game
they seen how people aren t buying this woke bovine scatology and said nope. game developers need to release finished games and quit putting in microtransactions or pay to win garbage just put out a good game and people will buy it
unfortunately this is probably the best case scenario. given how the rings of power turned out. i am hoping that the warhammer project dies on the vine as well. at least until there is a shift in the  kind of shows that they re making
i have always felt that tomb raider was or is sony s flag ship franchise. when i think of nintendo i think of mario  sega sonic  and sony tomb raider. now god of war but idk what the fuck happened to lara and tomb raider.
there s quite a lot of us and we are obsessed lol
depends on how much control they allow cavill to have over the show and script. if they are smart henry will have total control and final say.
after what amazon did to rings of power  i m glad. it would ve been garbage. lara is already in their sites to be completely  updated for a modern audience . the most recent reboots  though thoroughly enjoyable  already updated her. i think it s time to let her pass into nostalgia and leave her as is. i d rather have no new tomb raider than have them completely destroy her and turn her into some pathetic propaganda piece.personally  i like reboots lara  but i don t really think of her as lara. my fave tr game is underworld even with its wonky camera.
good  now give tomb raider to double m. give her a studio and let her make the best tomb raider game ever.
nah  tr is good  just pass it off to another good studio like cd  and give her the same design like in cd and we ll be fine. i ll never get the appeal of the older. i mean yea if they could modernize the graphics and give her the curvy look it be fine. but cd lara was still super hot and filled with character. so i m fine with it.
i feel for all you legacy tomb raider fans.  what you currently feel is what i currently feel for the spider-man ip.  the last spider project that i felt successfully captured the spirit  essence  core  and appeal of the ip  while reinterpreting and introducing a few elements for freshness and intrigue   was the spectacular spider-man cartoon series.  i don t think any media project since has quite captured the legacy appeal of spider-man since.tomb raider is in a tough place  as the only people with power and influence over that ip appear more interested in using the ip to help bolster their budgets  help limit risk  and push their own storied vision of an interactive movie with their own contrived message of what female empowerment means  with lara as the iconic vehicle to push those beliefs through.  i hope you guys get your proper tomb raider fix one day.   i m a nintendo fan  so i m eating good at the moment. loving zelda  and excited for final fantasy xvi!
lara croft in the tomb of woke!
maybe we could take a longer break from tomb raider. let the ip marinate for 5 or maybe even 10 years. give the developers opportunity to experiment with some new ideas or perhaps go bankrupt from unreasonable  unappreciated game as a service attempts and then sell the ip to someone who cares. or hell  make it go public domain  i ve heard the classic tomb raider engine has been hacked to pieces and re-made  re-written  expanded upon  modernized and all sort of crap - just let people make high quality mods and let them monetize their work.
meanwhile  final fantasy fans be chilling with every title.
tomb raider is dead to me.
i would love to see a developer that really loves the source material for legacy of kain do an update!
will they race swap lara aswell
might not be terrible--the franchise could ultimately find its way to a studio that will take an old school approach.
the best thing to do with the series is just to leave it alone at this time  especially with everything bowing down to the woke mob.i know that the reboot trilogy is frowned upon  like you said  great games but a detour and no longer being tomb raider.i personally found rise of the tomb raider to be my favorite of the recent trilogy  it being the closest to the originals in a way  having lara continue her father s adventures like in underword and being able to roam around croft manor and such.the series is at a major crossroad  if they want to create another installment they either return the series back to its roots or destroy it by going through with the direction of the alleged leaks.this is really sad to see.
stockholm syndrome
crystal dynamics does the opposite of capcom  because final fight  devil may cry  onimusha and some other games were becoming too much different from the franchises they were initially meant to be part of  capcom changed their names and created some of the most iconic franchises in gaming history  just the fact of changing the ips  name made what could ve been huge failures into huge successes  crystal dynamics should learn a thing or two with capcom.
things could be worse  imagine if disney owned the tomb raider license ..
i really enjoyed the last 3 games. just wish they had some form of vehicles   jeeps  kayaks   base jumping etc
an old school style tomb raider game with updated graphics and smoother gameplay would sell well.  amazon probably would of given you larry croft and his story about how he transitioned to laura.
and nothing of value was lost with this partnership failing.  embracer is still busy cleaning up the saints row mess.
if you want the closest version of a tomb raider game on the next gen consoles then you have to play jedi  fallen order and jedi  survivor. lots of exploration and puzzle solving in them
i dont understand how you can concentrate on anything with the door wide open like that!
i think the new serious started off okay  you know assuming laura was younger but she should have moved into the confident kick ass lady we know she is
so glad to see more tomb raider news even if it s bad news.
doom raider
the best tr game in many years is lara croft go.
last tomb raider game for me was underworld  after that  it was all gone for me.
really great video melonie. god bless you.
except legends is a great tr game.
just let the series die. it s never going to be what it was before and developers and tv networks will always cater to the woke crowd rather than the fans. also i don t understand this  team  thing. it s like their always has to be a team nobody can be a solo hero anymore.
did they lose faith in the brave  stunning and talented phoebe edit   oh i thought it was the tv show  not the games.
that thumbnail made me laugh...poor lara.
we need some one to bring back the old school tomb raider style of games.
tomb raider wasn t broken..never a need to fix it..angelina jolie is the one and only tomb raider. always has been  always will be.
3 kronor
get the classics and check out. nothing left to salvage here. only ips i have faith in anymore are the ones by nintendo. everything else has gone wokey woke.
thaks melanie mac
sorry to hear the news. it sounds kind of stupid to be sad  insert negative emotion of choice over a videogame but to fans it can be life-altering. i know the feeling  being a huge castlevania mgs fan. sucks....
love your excellent commentary on the topics you discuss. you re looking great. keep up the fitness journey!
good news
more reasons why i always considered crystal dynamics very incompetent when it came to them being game developers and for the creator of legacy of cain to even call them out. just proves my pointgranted i did like tomb raider legends underworld and 2013 but i do have to admit that those games weren t tomb raider at its best compared to previous titles
indy 5 vibes..
dang  you got the best takes
that s sad to hear about soulreaver  that was my first dive into the legacy of kain series  sad that soulreaver was born out of wedlock
tomb raider is free from fleebag
best thing that could happen to tomb raider.i am 100  sure amazon would go the dove fat woman in gaming route so thank god they won t get to destroy lara further.
just a friendly reminder to drink water. everyone have a wonderful day.
trust me you don t want amazon working on a ton raider game anyways.
just faithfully remake the original games to kickstart the series again.
it was never going to be tomb raider. it was going to be phobe waller bridge s reject indian jones series with a tomb raider make over. i guess her script is that bad.
i suspect the developer partnership was some kind of exclusivity deal with a platform  and it fell through. i don t follow gaming beyond watching your content  so take that with a grain of salt.as far as amazon goes  the more they stay away from  re-imagining  properties the better. companies only go down that route because they know that an original woke ip will be little more than a tax write-down. count your blessings if amazon is indeed done with tomb raider. perhaps daily wire will pick it up.
thanks for the video
recent series not having coherent stories or logical consistency  isn t that the new normal
probably for the best given amazon s track record. i know i don t want them getting their grubby mitts on deus ex  thief  legacy of kain  and tomb raider  all of which are currently under embracer s umbrella. we ll get new games from these storied ips one day just not today
i always wondered about that life sized lara statue you got. it must be a pain to move and i m sure you wrap it up n your neighbors probably think you re trying to dispose of a body.
that s a big yikes! well it s probably for the best. they probably would have done to tomb raider what they did to lotr.
love tr 2 tibet lara statue  and ye  for this news.. it s for the better  melonie  i don t want amazon or netflix do anything with game ip s  especially with woman protagonist  u know it  i know it  well know it it will be woke af and this alicia vikander version gonna be good for comparison   d
i just don t know anybody would be going after a video game character this much  it s a very strange obsession  to go after a video game character that much.
honestly as not a big tomb raider fan myself  this just makes me sad for you. i ve seen enough of your vids to know how huge a tomb raider fan you are  i m sorry.
i hope it is true.
what the current culture has done to this character is criminal.i m glad this deal folded. nobody wants to watch amy schumer play lara croft.
how dare you have uncomplimentary opinions on stuff...tsk tsk tsk
did all the good people leave crystal dynamics when they got sold  i mean i loved the reboot. the graphics where great  the story was pretty good  and the gameplay was great. i m not sure why some people hated it compared to the older older tomb raider games.
i like the tomb raider reboot games but for their gameplay  but not their characterization of lara. i excused it with the first game because i figured that experience would be what turns her into the lara we know and love. alas that was not the case.
the amazon tomb raider show is gonna a disaster full of crazy anti men femanazi nonsense.  i just wish they would get the games back in track before worrying about tv or film
i really enjoyed the crystal dynamics trilogy granted i never played any of the original games.
can someone explain the donators every video  very weird bot-like comments
as a sports fan   ghostbusters fan  and comic book fan  welcome to my world.
more excited for the anime unless thats axed as well
hopefully we re turning a corner on ruining things for pc brownie points.
it s over! and it s so incredibly sad...
amazon doesn t want to romance the stone.
why are standing in front of the mic and not sitting down
it s rather obvious that the amazon backed out of the movies and tv series after they saw the garbage fire that the next indiana jones is going to be  a movie that focus all around phoebe waller  the same phoebe these morons put in charge of these tomb raiders movies and shows.it s 100  the main reason of that big fallout.
all i can say is.......aye yai yai
i m happy that amazon is out less woke
bringsexylaraagain
why don t you buy it and make it work did the movers rob your chair
naaa amazon wanted a woke tomb raider game  and embrace went get fooked
boom
amazon has altered the deal. pray they don t alter it any further.
tomb raider is start looking like resident evil live action movies which in general suck  so time to cross finger and maybe just maybe tomb raider game could be at least decent.
i ve played all of them and i like the old ones and i like the crystal dynamics trilogy i don t understand that hate they get.
because i m not fat
just look what amazon did with lotr  which embracer has the media rights to.
i want to raid tombs  not watch a boring story about zombies and girl with daddy issues.
i take you did not like the reboot
sounds like a good thing to me.  consider that a bullet dodged.
crystal dynamics sounds a lot like disney owned lucas film.
id rather capcom make tomb raider games at this point at least they d remake them properly
i just watched the first tomb raider movie after decades of seeing it  when i was still a young teenager. felt refreshing  really. by acknowledging lara s sexiness  sophistication and badassery  that mediocre of a movie got it and even represented the icon of a character that was lara croft more than what crystal dynamics had done and probably would be doing. can t they just stick to what lara s essence was back then  she was not a role model for girls. they wanted something like that  they should have made a barbie game. she was  as you would say  a power fantasy. and to us dudes  she had a level of hotness on screen that was just so unique and very complementing to the game we played.tr2-3 to me is best lara.
gamers are not sheep...never was  and never shall be
amazon was just going to destroy it.
good
i really liked the legends trilogy form cd. also the lara croft spin off games. not a fan of the reboot trilogy at all.
modern gaming is dead   like most media is
so the new saints row and phoebe waller-bridge sinking indy 5  they might never call her again  might have had somehting to do with it good on embracer group. i think there learing woke dont sell cept dead island 2 that was in la  its an island   and that made sense.
better than getting woke crap.
did you do a video on that  08 20
have yousaid which native tribe you descend from
sad
ah man   what are the chances that anything amazon touches will be any good   they ve ruined everything they can buy!  wheel of time  halo  rings of power....smh  an we get a break from these losers for a year   can they not ruin or touch anyone else s creative material for a couple of years   smh....
good thing. let the ip rest or give it a pure korean or japanese company.
why would you want amazon to get it!  the current ones aren t woke they just aren t the classics.
cherokee and creek
@melonie mac go boom  thats so cool
i don t loland yes the current ones are very woke
@melonie mac go boom  jee zed misspelled   amazon
isn t ms..bridge involved in that project
okay let s not doom it before it comes out. don t be like the people counting out the new indiana jones movie and they haven t even seen it.
if you have doubts  don t buy it. let the sales plummet or else they will never learn. simple as that.if you have doubts and bought it knowing the consequences  don t complain  because you are the one who supported it.
the tv show yup lol
