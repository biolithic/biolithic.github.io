better advice for developers  treat your customers with love and respect and stop paying attention to angry dumb kids of many ages  doing death threats and woke mobs  and concentrate on your work.
devs didn t start getting disrespect from gamers until gamers started getting disrespect from devs and journos. though to be fair  youre right that its not on the devs when a game is bad most of the time. most of the time  its corporate suits. also  Im already sick of companies very recently suddenly all deciding they can dictate people s behavior outside their platform. you are a business  not the arbiter of morality
being a programmer myself  I understand how hard it is to find strange bugs in large applications  and because of that I tend to give some game devs leeway when they release a new free update patch and it adds a strange bug they didn t find in their beta testing. that being said  there is no excuse for releasing broken buggy games and the pay to win thing is awful and ruins a lot of new games to me that I would normally like to play. lost ark for example would be a game I d totally be interested in if it was a pay to buy or pay to subscribe with no pay to win  but Im not playing another korean gatcha game  I did that already with eos  total waste of money and time. path of exile has microtransactions but imo its done right. poe has nothing even close to pay to win besides extra stash slots and extra character slots but its very reasonable and a great game. lost ark you can literally pay to get upgraded gear  skip content  to the point that competitive guilds require people to be whales. its not defensible to me.
thanks again for a great video! you ve been a daily watch since jeremy at thequartering gave you a shoutout and really enjoying your content. ps  can we get a tour of your tomb raider collection   your favorites  thanks and thanks for the daily verse!
phil spencer being a corporate peon and putting politcally driven devs over the gamers who buy his products. he could have called out the constant toxicity from game journos who attack gamers or harass devs with different political opinions  like the creator of five night at freddies   but instead he lectures us.
its getting to the point where certain games are being used to house a specific ideology or narrative that the developers are wanting to push.
excellent vod  mel! I am of the opinion that people should not be respected if they do not deserve it. there are certain game companies and game devs out there that do not deserve respect. I feel ya on the stubbornness  I used to be very stubborn  took a ton of work across many years to get rid of that issue.
your videos are very captivating. your tone and cadence draw you in and your banter feels engaging. good stuff mac. Im not a  gamer  the only game I d gotten into was diablo ii.  on and off for 16 years  and a little d3. however  I can always relate in someway to your message. Im also enjoying the Bible verses
melonie  youre probably my new favorite youtuber. I have been watching you for a while  but this new channel is the ish! love to see the interaction with your subs  and the messages from the Bible!  my dad is technically a boomer  and I am ten years older than you  so the kids should not get upset about being called  boomers. also  youre pretty nice to look at
did four years software qa for a studio under a very large publisher and am credited on two aaa titles.  loved the job and the people I worked with in qa.  and yes  grandma s boy is how it is. developers deserve absolutely  everything they get --.--
it would be nice if publishers and platform holders do the same thing  and stop censoring games on their shops and platforms or dictate what the developer can and can not do in their games  their projects and their visions.
one of my philosophies is  better to seem the fool than open my mouth and remove all doubt.  every time I open my mouth without the brain clutch engaged  Imake a royal a   of myself. keep on keeping on  mel.
with the title and thumbnail my thoughts are  does this mean the developers are going to treat their fans with respect and like adults
being gamedev myself... the thing is - usually the  workers  become the target  not the  politicians  who are on top and in charge. what I want to say - not every worker have enough say in what company makes  and they still gets there share of hate. even after tons of sleepless nights and desperatly trying to fit into unreasonable deadlines. but I agree with the message - respect your players  and then you will be respected.
I think key banned user lists is that if a player is flagged in enough different people s banned user lists then they should get an escalating set of warnings and penalties.
I think both gamers and people like phil spencer are saying they want the same thing  but the expectation of how it is done is different. one  phil wants gamers to treat game devs like humans even though they may agree or disagree with specific topics by giving actual criticism thats isn t just stating an apparent state of the game without giving more context of how it affects the game. secondly  gamers want developers and publishers to treat us like humans that are not some pay pig or ist and phobias by giving us a complete product thats not attacking us or unplayable.
respect goes both ways
I like your attitude. in the extremely unlikely event we ever met in person  I feel like we would become legit friends.just random musings. carry on.
my main problem is when it comes to existing franchises  they try to change too much of the game rather than just sticking with your core game  to try to gain newer younger audiences. my biggest example is halo. halo 3 was great balanced with a huge player base. the subsequent games added sprint and other movement mechanics that change the fundamental way you play the game. player base dropped dramatically with each new title up until infinite. they went back towards some of the more core mechanics that made the original trilogy good but unfortunately they are already committed to the extra movement abilities. hard to win back fans when they spit in their face when they provided feedback on their dislike of the newer games.
nice video  keep up the good work.
best advice for developers  treat your customers like without them you dont exist because you dont. if you make a product your customer doesnt like dont blame them its your fault.
I wouldn t say that completely  but yet in a large scale  it happens for a reason. we ve sadly always had those few extreme people across all mediums that do take their complaints overboard  and no amount of microtransactions or publisher bs excuses something like death threats over balancing patches. still  there is an increased thing of what may be badly lumped as  toxic behavior  that comes out more when bad decisions and stupidity inspire it  and absolutely none of it will ever do any helping towards the minority that was going to be toxic anyway. they re emboldened by it  seeing waves of other people angry  and justified to do stupid stuff  because someone or a few from the company disrespected their audience and lead to heavy criticism. the crazy people aren t a scapegoat though  the work still needs to just be done right like any other job.
@porcin3 proph3t  I agree with you. gaming communities in general have been full of so much negativity going back decades. anytime I was excited about a new game I d go to my favorite sites to see what people were saying and it was almost always a steady stream of complaining.
yep. if there are bugs due to dumbass copy protection or pay to win crap  I have no sympathy for the devs.
thats one reason I chose to play lost ark purely from a single player perspective.  I dont like guilds or most mmo type play anyway.  yes  the story and dialogue are kind of thin  but its not a tough game to get into and the grind hasn t been that bad  at least for now - unless something changes  I wont have to spend a dollar on it. however  I already see that long-term play in it may not have enough fuel for me to keep interest  so the jury is still out on that.  regardless  I have a great looking female martial artist for my character.
I stop giving leeway based on what they do with the updates. for instance cod black ops coldwar  they would hastily patch  exploits  that gave neglible advantages in zombies  such as jumping to a balcony to avoid paying for the first door which saved the player a whopping 750 essence  - which is basically pve. yet  exploits in multiplayer and cheaters went untouched for for versions on end. or even game breaking bugs in zombies mode went on for months but again   exploits  that had a limited effect on zombies were patched in days if not hours.they also never seemed to have a problem with their in game store and release all new skins and camos and other cosmetic garbage that they sold for real world money. heaven forbid they take resources away from that and actually devote it to fix real problems. so no  certain devs do not get a pass on the trash patches they put out.
exactly my point I talked about above. its not our responsiblity to know who is responsible to for the politics  financials and stuff. so the devs suffer  unfortunately.
dude  its often not the devs who are ultimately responsible for any of this shit. its their bosses who define the policies of their companies. so getting angry at the actual developers and attacking them doesnt help even in the slightest  its just barking up the wrong tree. when a developer knows their game is unfinished and in no shape to be released  but their higher-ups demand a release in order to satisfy the shareholders  prime example  cdpr with cyberpunk 2077   its already a shitty situation for the devs  as they know that they are releasing something shitty and probably feel bad about it already. no point in attacking the developers then.
certain games
phil wouldn t survive a mw2 lobby lol  hahaha
give the corporations more power because that never end badly!  the corporate shills
its poiitics and studios who are weaponizing creativity  not gamers
respect comes from both sides.
I ll always remember how people loved cdpr and back  they even made a nice goodbye video from the witcher and people loved them  and the moment cdpr fucked up with cyberpunk  the people who loved them quickly turned their backs and shit got nasty very fast.
keep up the great work  mel! gaming devs need to be called out when they cut corners and just think its okay to patch shit up later  was interested in cyberpunk 2077 but seeing how much time they had and how much they royally fucked it up  no way. dont care about the patches. its about the principle.
melonie  who do you think should ve wonthe game awards if not it takes two
hey melonie mac you are spectacular and I love your show!!!!  isuportmeloniemacforever
I would think that  respecting creators  would first and foremost entail honoring the key elements and vision of the og makers of any successful ip which you have been blessed to inherit. that applies to everything from the sophistication and planning of civ to the bewbs  bullets  and boldness of classic croft. every time I hear a creator say  reimagined  I wince and mentally substitute  bastardized . thats what it virtually always is  a euphemism employed by skeezy  second rate wannabees who lack the authenticity to build something original and genuine.boom
leave game devs alone  hell no
golden rule  treat others how you would want to be treated. but  when devs dump on the fans for one reason or another  we call them out. its only fair. especially when those individuals either tear down a franchise that is dear to us  start working in woke garbage  etc. as a creator  you have to be willing to take criticism. if youre not  youre in the wrong business.
sorry phil  all good faith has long since been broken.  its the job of you and your kind to earn our respect back.I speak with my wallet too  the last game I bought was over a year ago  valheim  and yup that is a startup studio with a single dev who speaks spoke to the players himself without a beurocratic pr structure telling him what to say and how to  combat criticism .Im long done with big gaming companies  and if they want my wallet back... well they re going to have a long uphill road to try and convince me.
if the devs and publishers treated their games and history associated with the game with respect  there wouldn t be an issue! there s nothing wrong with updating some aspects  but we cannot erase what made a title great. nothing wrong with criticism in a respectful manner.
I dont know if anyone actually read the article or just went off the context of the title. phil spencer does not condone console wars is basically what he was saying. dont weaponize their games to antagonize fellow gamers on other consoles. in no way does he say people should not voice their concerns and complaints of a game. Im pretty sure he loves feedback from the gamers. some devs might get butthurt about comments but others will take it in stride and listen to improve their work. I think we should all respect the hard work of devs that respect the feedback of us gamers.
I know there are some young folks in here  but  as crazy as itsounds there once was a time  a very long time ago  that when a game  or even consoles came out they were complete and actually worked. that was back when everything cost a nickle.
I always wanted kate beckinsale as lara. she s a really good action star. plus underworld movies are some of my fav. for a new lara id love lily james
I d leave devs alone if it didn t feel like they purposely ignore what makes videogames....videogames.
seeing you in a jacket for the first time makes me want to give you a hug because you are cold
microtransactions  existlootboxes  existjournos whipping up twitter mobs over the smallest  most pedantic issues for over a decade  existphil spencer fans  criticize companies for cutting corners  changing series for the worse  implement predatory practices and releasing unfinished broken products.phil spencer  umm thats uncalled for.kinda tired of out-of-touch idiots always being in charge of entertainment.
if people want respect  they have to be the first ones to give it instead of waiting to receive it. but time and time again  do devs disrespect their loyal customer base  because they rather pander to a  wider audience  of non-paying ideologues who hate them.
she is totally unaliving it  isnt she
treat others the way you want to be treated works both ways wether its devs or those commenting. in my opinion both sides should be respectful to each other even when we disagree about a topic.
he s vague about what exactly he s referring to when fans get mad at devs. its possible he s just talking about the usual console wars nonsense  as he s talked about that before.
it goes both ways game developers should treat the gaming community who keep them in business with dignity and respect.
developers need to stop reimagining their existing ips. rebooting remaking something is totally fine  but not changing the core identity of the property. look at how well ff7 remake turned out. they didn t fundamentally change the personalities  characterization  or values of the cast like is the case with the tomb raider reboots  the game was just brought into the modern era.
out of curiosity  would you be willing to do the political compass test
of course phil doesnt want bad games trashed. its not good for business. good thing he dont get to decide who gets hushed.
imagine if there were no traffic lights..lol.
I agree with the concept of  leave gaming devs alone!  when it comes to endlessly badgering these companies to make changes to their games for shallow  narcissistic  arbitrary reasons. dumb stuff like  what the character is wearing how the character looks  or set difficulties of the game   accessibility  issues. the only problem with hanging back and staying silent over a games development is you get these asshat activists larping as gamers  who come in and  educate  the devs on all the problematic choices they re making in their game design. then what you are left with is an extremely partisan way of making games that excludes an entire other side of gaming. however when those groups speak out they get labeled as misogynistic ists and phobes  etc who hate and fear change.if phil was sincere about leaving game devs alone  he d clap back at every last single one of these hack journalist websites and blacklist them from events  interviews and coverage of upcoming games for the system. they re the ones endlessly and passive aggressively taking shots at the dev team but unlike your actual fanbase phil  they dont buy your games by the millions. long time vested gamers do.
I would say most of the criticism consumers have are towards the tops of studios  not the  on the ground workers.   all that aside. phil should maybe preach not to the consumers  but to the other publishers. I would say if publishers started treating their devs with dignity and respect  maybe they would make good games that their fans will love. they set their own devs up for failure when releasing unfinished games  and the devs are the ones who get flamed.
I am not a gamer but I do agree with phil spencer that I do wish that people would leave the gaming devs alone bc it would hurt it and no one would buy the games system and games and it would lose a lot of money if people dont leave it alone  ok mel. anyway I do hope you understand what I am trying to say to you  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening with your mother and hope you have a good night too  ok mel.
love proverbs 12 15. I try to always get council. its important to hear others advice  especially when you are the boss. in my life I can say that I have never regretted getting advice. funny thing is when I was younger I used to always get mad at my father for lecturing me and now I seek his advice. hope you have a great weekend with your mother!
here s an old school idea  release better products  get less hate.  crazy huh
there is no doubt that developers can and have been trash but on the same token we have a lot of crazy gamers thatshot out death threats both  communites  need to cool their jets. gamers offer constructive criticism developers finish your game before you charge 60 to 70 bucks.
I loved the eldin ring cryticle I think on kotaku where the woman cries about create a character options and how america sucks because of black people or something.someone should tell that particular writer  from software is... japanese... which is why its so good with actual gameplay.
quote    thats not their fault whatsoever  publishers put out unfinished games and developers cant do anything about it   this!!
the heat that developers get is due to their out of touch publishers  phil should go talk to them and stop lecturing the customers because they are unhappy with these low quality games being put out.
I agree with spencer but if a company messes up they should listen to us like I bought the walking dead definitive edition and damn its glitched to hell sometimes but its graphically better and such but the bugs suck like kicks you to the xbox home screen audio cuts out its bad and I payed for it I got xbox discount half price but still its disappointing I love the games I just wanna enjoy it without glitches so far there s no updates to fixing the glitches even after I reported it to the dev its disappointing
I dont blame the devs  I blame the publisher s pressure on them to meet deadlines. Im totally fine to wait a while for a new game rather than getting a yearly poorly optimized call of duty.
when fifa first started with ultimate team I probably spent  200 to  300 on that game that year with fifa points. I learned how to play the game ever since and only have spent maybe  20 extra a year on the ultimate editions of the games. then never bought an in game purchase after that. in - app purchases  such as fortnite  are a joke because they give you no competitive advantage only some sort of clout.
what do you have against  it takes two  winning
that is some b.s that they can release a video game that is not complete - and then create patches - I bought like  250 worth of playstation games this Christmas season for my ps5 and I really would love to play some tomb raider - hopefully soon.
respect should be earned  not given.
oh wow youread scriptures from the Bible - God bless you melonie mac goes boom.
if you want an unknown actress that would have been ok as lara and was in the right age range  look up emily booth from the uk  now present the horror channel.
unlike most I wont complain about microtransactions... when they re done right. I ll be more then happy to pay for extra levels on a free to play game I enjoy or even a skin but draw the line at pay to win or paying for the complete game I already purchased.
another ceo turning their shit into a social creditscore so they can shut you down when you dont kiss their feet or their friends feet.
another day another video. hope youre having a nice weekend!
sure once they stop treating me as like a walking talking atm.
personally Ive never played tomb raider  but I was an avid fan of the old neverwinter nights  diablo series  and was a beta tester for city of heroes villains. hate the fact that they changed some of the characters in the diablo reboots  smaller boobs and such when it came to the assassins. pretty much lost all faith in developers and just stick to my old rpg s.
playing elden ring and I actually took what he said in a positive way first  thinking about all the whining about easy mode. glad I watched this though
melonie  have you had the pleasure of eating elk or caribou
idk how big you are into the sims but this reminds me of the recent backlash of the sims 4 my weddings stories. which was completely bugged and unplayable.
we d leave game developers alone if they quit lying about the features of their games that they never include  they hype up their games just to get a sale when they know they shouldn t be selling garbage like that. if game devs dont want any feedback weather it be negative or positive then get off social media  get the game done.
oh wow  elizabeth hurley would be a perfect croft.
hey phil   how about you fix the issues with your console  like the constant crashboarding. no  dont rearrange the guide  fix the chashboarding! no  Im not asking for the dashboard to be more shiny  Im asking for you to fix the crashboarding. no  I didn t say delete commonly used settings  I said fix the crashboarding!!! oh wait  I forgot  phil doesnt really care about the gamers  he just said he did for sales. that why I got rid of my series x  and will never go back to xbox.
the big bad gamers need to stop bullying the itty-bitty billion dollar companies and just be grateful for any broken  buggy  predatory slot machines they give us.
I totally understand that devs are not the problem but their bosses. and I think most gamers know this too. they cantry this crap if they want. I will vote with my wallet and play indie games and whatever else isn t woke and full of bs. and if that means I dont buy any new games that year so be it. Imostly play shooters and those peaked with quake 3 arena quake live anyways.
developers should treat gamers with more dignity and respect. when they create crap games and call the gamers all kinds of names for not liking it then they shouldn t cry like a baby when the gamers call them out on it.
any complaints are not directed at the ones in the trenches but the generals on high. if games were released whole and completed when we pay for it a lot of complaints would disappear. frankly  Im old enough where I remember getting complete games  but now its either released buggy and broken most of the time and we have to wait on either patches or in some cases the community to mod fix it. what irritates me the most though is them releasing a game then charging for dlc to  complete the story.   Im not mentioning any games here but we all can picture games that have had one two or even all of the above problems especially the last to squeeze more money out of us.
its at the point now where if I feel a game is going down the woke garbage disposal. I dont buy it. dont even bother reading about it after that. even something that Im really looking forward to. in the end its just a game. plenty of indI s that haven t impressed me. now when people put something together that reaches the core gamer community like they used to  people see it and recognize it and for me thats where my money goes. people have been loving hating games forever for many different reasons lol why now are some companies doing-as-they-are-told by mobs that couldn t care less about the games themselves. some here and there will be actual gamers but the bulk of the crybabies id just ask why the f    do you care
im turning 26 this summer and you right about our generation is bad about complaining. the tomb raider movies were my introduction too the character and been a die hard ever since. but I been really disappointed in the tomb raider games after underworld. they fun and interesting stories. but classic lara needs to return.
phil also thinks infinite was a complete game and he would love to be able to ban people from all platforms for doing things microsoft doesnt like.  and all the employees there listing their pronouns tells me all I need to know about microsoft now
devs need to respect fans which they ve decided not to do yet they want respect while disrespecting fans smh.  okay maybe its the publishers who need to respect fans  nintendo is usually good about respecting fans and I love being a mac bomb melanie.
game dev s should be left alone but so should gamers. gamers bear all the burden s of bad practices of publishers and dev s. now phil wants cross platform ban s which will be used against criticism s. there is really no advocacy for gamers other than youtubers when game journo s should be holding exec s or producers etc by name accountable. so of course when dev s come to blow there own horns on how great there are  they are the only point of contact for gamers. maybe if gamers voices are heard more there will be less toxicity as a whole  and gamers in return might help keep the toxicity to a minimum.
do you follow a Bible reading plan  I am doing the one where youread the entire Bible in a year. I on day 298 but I started the plan like 3 years ago. I keep have to hit the  catch me up  button in the app. a lot of the old testament reading is a slog to get thru for me.
naw I ll treat them equally.
the difference between spencer and game developers dev s job is to  appease  the players  which they have been failing to do spencer  not being a dev  but the head of a program that encompasses all these teams of devs  its actually his job to stand up for defend protect these devs  not the players.the devs are suppose to make stuff the players want to play  and its spencers job to protect the devs as they are his employees for lack of better wording.so  if the devs made good games  the spencer wouldn t be in this situation.politics has a far reach  and this is one of the very few times Ive heard him speak out like this.
commenting to feed the algorithm
yes sometimes its not developers fault take two games for example red dead redemption 2 the managers held that game up to get absolutely perfect and when it came out it was the delay was worth it unlike cyberpunk 2077 the managers push that game out it had more bugs than an ant hill it was a complete and utter disaster. and as from microsoft with its gaming platform how many disastrous decisions did they make over the xbox series to this day it cant even outsell playstation in fact the playstation 5 sold more consoles in its first year than microsoft could ever imagine or hope for.
why not just do like ea and ignore all the valid complaints about crappy software releases  battlefield or every sims pack and kit  and then release  new content  a year later that was actually patches and stuff thatshould have been or worked in the original release   why did phil spencer feel the need to open his mouth   all he did was create more controversy.  but maybe thats what he wants.
all because they to please 1 person that dont know how to play video games   didn t buy them for that matteryeah  we re looking at you anita sarkeesian
problem is some gamers dont know the difference between giving valid criticism and being outright disrespectful and rude. long as the developers do their best to listen and not be deceptive in their attempts to right something they did wrong  no man s sky and currently cdpr are an example of this  gamers need to make sure they understand the line between the right and wrong way to communicate their issues with a product. another good example of this is george lucas and star wars. the sheer vitriol and hate lucas received over the special editions and prequels  while the point of why is valid- how it was expressed drove star wars into the clutches of disney. those fans killed lucas  love for his own creation with how bitter and honestly  cruel they were. why anything disney does to star wars now is pretty much on the shoulders of those fans that pushed lucas to sell.
feelings...
phil spencer all hailed blue haired  privileges!zaaaiaz sz gears of war  my response  I jokingly complimented the micro transaction e sportsgrind battle pass they went over priced the cosmetics price 30 anything imaginary in the game worldis hardly worth15 buck if its costume over another costume its shouldn t be more than 50 cents honestly took break after beating the campaign most third parties example  salem s witch  horror game had the most out dated auto save giltch that would break the game  and not let continue the store plot at all!tormented souls on xboxhad on purpose delete your save files  and make yourestart almost the whole game!
kind of funny how game devs sit on the internet and complain about people criticizing about their product instead of fixing it or giving them things they dont want in their product. imagine if a car company had their engineers being outspoken people on the internet and instead of addressing issues they just claimed  those toyota tacoma owners are a toxic group of people. if you cant deal with people stay off social media.they love to have opinions  then get hurt when opinions start coming back at them.
hello melonie mac goes boom.
there s a chain of leadership and responsibly like any other job or business. its not difficult to understand if you ve worked literally any job. maybe 5  of developers are actually responsible for the decisions being made  and blanketing all  devs  isn t going to change anything. its about as petty and useless as yelling at the person working the drive through because taco bell discontinued the mexican pizza.
is she gonna talk about the gta 6 leaks...
depending on who they are  I dont owe game devs shit. even ones who s games I love and highly respect  I still dont owe them anything. sorry for the language. you want my respect  put out decent products.
so  let me rant about this. the devs are not management  who usually decide these things. in aaa studios  the devs have to do what their told. however  no one knows the managements name. the blame goes to management  but the public doesnt know who they are  so the hate gets directed at the devs. in very few cases is a dev given 100  artistic freedom with anything. so  unless you are part of the journo community  the gaming community doesnt give af about the politics  they just point the finger.  I get that its not right  but the management team isn t exactly coming out and declaring responsibility.
hey brand new subscriber! hImelonie
why should we treat developers with respect when some clown community manager or creative director constantly goes on social media to call everyone they disagree with a bigot  look at what greedydog  Im sorry  naughtydog  did when they released the last of us part ii. some people on the dev team went on twitter and basically said that anyone who doesnt like their game is a sexist. and let s not forget all the extremely predatory microtransactions  gambling mechanics and pay-to-win mechanics in our games now  and the stupid games-as-a-service crap. respect goes both ways  phil. stop treating gamers like your own personal piggy bank.
melanie  I am a real boomer  aka baby boomer - born before 1964
right lol these people dont understand how business works
depends what changes youre talking about. shipping games early  ya  thats a corporate thing. watering down a character series to be  more progressive   that could still be corporate decision  however thats quickly debunked when the devs talk about how the changes now are great  and their past games are something to look down on. if something was a purely corporate decision and not one they wanted  they wouldn t willingly boast about it outside a pr setting  their personal twitter accounts   where they aren t forced to say xyz  like they are at a trade show.
@mrshmuga9  even if a taco bell employee tells you   yeah and Im glad the mexican pizza is off the menu   its still not their fault or responsibility for it being off the menu. the further down the chain of command you go exponentially the less responsibility exists. here s who holds the cards  heads of the company  investors  producers  and directors  its a small percentage of an entire studio  and yes they decide everything regardless of any employee s opinion. I didn t invent this concept  its business management and operation 101.
@underthegun897  I know haha. so many gamers think they have the business understanding of andrew carnegie because they beat dark souls.
@mike garn  the difference is they re propagating that mindset to continue. bigwigs listen to what reviewers say so they ll get good scores because they re old and still believe it represents the customer. devs and reviewers get a bit too chummy and since they re all in the same political bubble  agree that x needs to change for  reasons . devs leads tell their superiors they  need  those changes to get higher scores because of reviewers and the cycle continues. the taco bell employee doesnt get drinks and parties with food critics like they do in the game industry at events. team leads probably to a lesser extent but that happens too. its all very incestuous. just look at how many reviewers go on to work at actual game studios. its because they re ridiculously close to each other.
@mike garn  as long as we can continue to complain that everything is  woke  all is well
@mrshmuga9  Ive worked aaa for 8 years  Ive been a lower tier dev the entire time  well until I starting my own studio. none of what youre saying is the reality of being a game developer.
@underthegun897  agreed. some of us ex-aaa devs are going against the grain and building our own studios because we dont like where mainstream gaming is going. hopefully we ll be in a more balanced gaming space in the next couple years.
@mike garn  aaa is going to go where trends are and where the money is that follows these trends. these grifter channels complain that nobody wants this modern lara croft or that there is some  woke  agenda. if that was true then why did shadow of the tomb raider sell like 9 million copies. thats more than most games in the tr franchise especially the original crystal dynamics trilogy which had  classic  lara
@mike garn  maybe youre just too low tier to go to events  or aren t there representing the  aaa company s  game at said events  and thus no one sees you consistently to recognize   I dont know. I dont even mean that as an insult. they re not gonna have programmer  32 at every event showcasing the game. so maybe its moreso leads and the pr team. but plenty of journalists talk about hanging out with devs and or becoming friends through various industry events. just because it hasn t happened with you  doesnt mean it hasn t at all.and journalists definitely get close enough to get jobs with companies they cover. I know off hand of 4 ign employees that ended up working for companies they covered. I know there s more but these are the only named ones I recall that you could actually search. audrey drake  and rich george ended up working for with nintendo after covering them exclusively for few years. and while mitch dyer didn t join xbox  the platform he mostly covered   he did end up joining ea as a writer  which is still a huge publisher that would be at every major event . oh yeah and alana pearce also joined sony santa monica after being a journalist for a number of years too. colin moriarty doesnt work for any studios  but he s also mentioned he s friends with neil druckman and a number of other devs. journalists already have close enough ties with not just the companies but important leads of these companies to get actual jobs at with these studios.
@mrshmuga9  thats my entire point  the vast majority of us are not upper tier in the studio  most of us are some version of programmer  32. if there s some event 95  of us aren t being invited. if the games jounos are friends with anyone it aint us regular employees  why  because we have no influence in the studio. so back to my original point  holding every game developer responsible for the shenanigans going on in modern gaming is counterproductive because most of us have no say in it.
@mike garn  no one s holding everyone to it though. they only complain to about the clearly outspoken devs that propagate this stuff in the first place.
@mrshmuga9  you literally started out trying to  debunk  the idea bud  and the entire comment section on here is filled with people blaming the  devs  which by definition is all of them. this was the entire premise of my original comment  it is the only reason I commented in the first place. this is the internet so idk what I was expecting. Im glad to see you ve come around though. all the best.
in all fairness Im a game developer and from my experience most dev s just want to make good games  but you have high management pushing woke agenda s that even if you argue with you will be shut down and black balled. the same can be said about feedback on features and mechanics  upper management dont want to hear it but all the lower devs know it to be a issue. often you hear they re a to many time and money constraints to address issues and we ll deal with it after release. however a lot of the other shite comes from the publisher  you have a bunch of marketing execs that dont really play game make these calls. micro transactions  live service models  incomplete games are due to the publishers trying to get the game out to the market as fast a possible and trying to make the most amount of the money from it. day one patches are often because sony s and microsoft s long and extensive submission processes.I have no issue with critique  but targeted threats on dev s is of course extreme and shouldn t be tolerated. people just say you should just ignore these folks and do you job  I d ask if they ve had someone threaten their life or their families because of something trivial like a game  99  of the time nothing will come of it but there is the possibility you landed that 1  crazy  so its always in the back of your mind. equally I dont endorse shitting on fans either  your paying our wages after all.
the title of the article  and therefore the basis of this video  seems to be misleading to what phil was actually saying. to my understanding  he s talking about the console wars that are going on as well as people who take it to the extreme with death threats and the like. to the point of buggy games... as I learn more about game development myself  its clear that people dont understand how games are made. for example  let s talk about cyberpunk 2077. groundbreaking  next gen features with a huge open world with unique side missions  3 different beginnings  different ways to play the game  different choices  different skill trees  etc etc etc etc all with the development demands from the different platforms that you couldn t even imagine...  all that doesnt take a flip of a switch to make. it takes hundreds of people  all in sync  moving in the same direction to make that. then you got the publishers producers stock investors that have expectations you have to meet. also  there is the people who complain about delays and say  just release the game already  and complain when they agree to release it and its broken.so  to melonie s point  sending death threats to timmy and his family on twitter  or even demanding he fix the game immediately  when he just worked on the reload animations for all the different guns is beyond ridiculous.thank you for coming to my tedtalk. spread Jesus  love  dont spread hate. God bless.
cant think of anything to say.
kate beckinsale in the underworld series. would she have been a good lara croft in the 2000s  wesley snipes was perfect for blade back in the late 90s and early 2000s  now they chose mahershala alI  he s almost 50 and he s not a martial artist  how ridiculous. they should have chosen an unknown michael jay white type 20-something years old. alI was great in alita battle angel though  but he wont be in blade. so much money thrown at a 50 years old name for no good reason. nathan fillion is way too old for nathan drake  they waited way too long... but they chose a kid for the role instead of a late 20  early 30 years old. hollywood is such a joke.
I play battlefield 2042 and that fps game has been hated on so so bad.
would be nice if microsoft wasn t such horrible in gamedev. they had generic sci-fImultiplayer shooter  1  halo  and generic sci-fImultiplayer  2  gears   now they bought another generic multiplayer shooter  cod . wow. american games in its best. he literally said there will be no vr for xbox because  you cant play with other people in vr . yeah  did he ever heard of normal single-player games  sony with bloodborne  last of us  persona 5 yeah they are releasing it on xbox after 7 years  and  microsoft with.... ehhh another multiplayer garbage  they soooo on different levels  Imean bloodborne alone is better that all xbox exclusives ever existed combined together.
phil spencer is a great dude and a really good person. he is a real gamer who single-handedly saved xbox from shutting down and he cares a lot about the devs and gamers.
not enough arm
the nonsense of this guy is baffling! they are the reason why studios are having garbage releases lately in the first place. he is right  devs arent the problem! people in charge of the game  directors  managers  etc.  are the ones pushing these unfinished games or adding bp  they are the ones that give the final call on what will be released  not devs!if something people should blame game studios for it which is the case . look at halo  the game is decent  but having 50  of the game  makes the game boring af.
call me mac boomer!  ha!
to his whiny plea  no.creators make a product. commercial art isn t for the artist. commercial artists aren t creators their manufacturesrs. they manufacturer a product for a company designed to sell to an audience. maybe game developers should start thinking of it that way. maybe then they would understand that what they do is called business. its not fun and games. when a manufacturer calls his customers bigots because they dont like his product the manufacturer is the problem.
sorry but nothe moment you start splitting hairs on things like publisher dev you cede ground to them.let s step outside gaming for an example  kathleen kennedy has obliterated star wars  it is a ruin of what it once was. nothing about it is free from being broken now.why because kathleen and her people who are the top brass hired developers who also hate the brand who also hate the fans and also hate the product  they agree with her that it needs to change and they start imposing their own ideas on the product.this leads to 3 films that are trainwrecks and 3 out of 4 series that are abysmal failures in every aspect with the 4th failing in season 2.so yes  shit on the devs  yes give them endless criticisms  because when you cannot confirm they are not also part of the problem when a product is terrible  they hold the lions share of blame by going along with what their bosses said to do.
how am I supposed to respect the devs and designers of fallout 76  lol
been making my own game for over 6 years with money out of my own pocket.been working as a mobile app developer for a few years which helps me budget my own game.being both a gamer and game dev  its very demotivating seeing the state of both games and the gaming community  the entitlement is strong on both sides.talk with anybody justifying piracy who cant afford 10 dollars to buy a game ...gamers will justify it with something like 10 dollars is too much  it could buy a meal.and devs  well  this was from a streamer  which is even worse coming from her side -monetizing her streams  aka  monetizing her playing the creation of other people-  would say something like if you cant afford 10 dollars maybe you should be prioritizing work and economic stability.thing is  they re both right.there was a time between my current job as a developer and my previous job as a cook where I was jobless. after getting exploited on a corporate retirement villa job where I was a cook  I quit with 2k dollars on my pockets  which was all I could save after almost 5 years... thats california   I spent the next 2 months working on my own game to make a demo and get it out there so that I could use that as experience in my portfolio while I applied for other jobs as a game dev  note  I said the next 2 months doing that  but I had been working on my game for way longer than that  staying awake all night because I d get off my shift at 9pm and then start the next shift at 6am . I got to that point where 10 dollars would buy me bread and beans to last me a week. I didn t have any luck finding any jobs.but in the end  Imade 9 dollars from the demo I uploaded on gamejolt  that was enough to get me a meal. the rest of the story is just me working at a burger king before finally landing a job as an app developer where Imoved to georgia and later virginia .so I know how 10 dollars can afford a meal. I also know that in that time I was busy trying to secure a future and not spending time on video games.out of the 190 people who downloaded my demo  only 3 were kind enough to donate and those 3 bought my beans and bread for a week.so try to figure out how I feel about people who are entitled and pirate games because those 10 dollars can feed a person  but on the other hand  I was the person who needed to eat and those 10 dollars came from people who did pay for my game.and seeing comments like some below here and I quote mamamob and their comment on this video...  best advice for developers  treat your customers like without them you dont exist because you dont. if you make a product your customer doesnt like dont blame them its your fault. so Ive been spending sleepless nights and budgeting my game from my own pockets from my full time jobs  and the best advice I get is I should be grateful that I exist because of them of course this is mostly because of aaa game companies with a business model meant to please the stakeholders    but as someone who works as an app developer  games dont exist because of gamers  they exist because of the investors  gamers who buy the games are the ones who repay the investors  and more .unless gamers personally fund the creation of games  then no  games dont exist because of gamers  they exist because investors paid for it  game studios got the budget they needed from their investors  investors want their money back soon  games are rushed because of them  once games are released and money invested is restored to the stockholders  then devs are free to work and polish the game at their pace.and this whole thing is a cycle of violence that will only end until one side decides to end it  which will never happen  because neither the developers nor the gamers think they re the ones at fault.
the older millennials are the good ones.
the worst simps are phI spencer simps cough cough mrmatty
I dont care what anyone says. heath ledger will always be lara croft to me.
dropping like  60 on a game and its either broken or trash or just both Im someone who primarily plays offline because I only get 20gb of internet a month and I can only so many updates done on thatso I dont want to pay for a broken trashy game.
day 5 of commenting on your based videos until g-fuel will sponsor me too.holding out for a dream since they need 50 000 subs I just found out... but I will not give up!
lol the snowflakes
yeah  like that gt7 and hfw crap
developers need to earn respect  and they dont do so when they produce woke nonsense that most people dont want. they are toxic  as they clearly have contempt towards gamers who dont buy games to be preached at. I have been increasingly buying games used in order to avoid funding woke developers. I dont respect them because they dont respect me and the majority of gamers. they dont deserve my respect  and they dont deserve my money.
and leave britney alone also! !!
they charge for their half assed games and dare to complain about  treatment. apple doesnt do this shit with their customers.
why he doesnt go tell that to game journos that want dev s to make games easier or  accesible  normal people respects creativity  we dont respect broken bs  draconian lootbox systems or people without ethics like pitchfork or bobby kotick.
based.
if they want dignity and respect  the developers need to quit trying to tell us what we should like. they preach eternally about their pet projects or political views.
eh I thought his comments were tame
talk shit about mario all they want  super mario bros 3 objectively remains the best game ever made with tetris as a close second.
we will not stop bashing your traitorous product
Im totally agree if the focus of the comment is about creative liberty and stop the bulls.. about turning eveything to the woke agenda. im tired of the new agenda be something important on videogame development  turn good games on a piece of sh... games like the last of us 2  the new lara croft  the new western character design looks..... when the   journalist   blows their mind beacuse the race and color of a character  or the lack of a more racial character editor like the recent the elden ring.... okk!!! sure....  leave gaming devs alone!
--boomer says  I doubt many boomers were confused by your use of the word. what I find so amusing is how many people assume boomers are tech-illiterate - we invented the pc  the gaming console  and the video game. the integrated circuit  the transistor  and the internet. are there tech-illiterate boomers  yeah  lots. did we as a generation make many mistakes - more than a person could list in a lifetime. but then  we accomplished a lot too.   I d be happy if each generation just made fewer mistakes than the previous one. that would be real progress. --ex developer says  devs rarely get to say when something is released. thats a marketing sales thing and is often decided with zero input from devs. if left to the devs  I suspect every game you ve ever played would have been at least a year longer in development  excepting those who have played games developed by one person . Ive had that battle more than a few times - and it comes down to  if you cant  we ll find someone who can.  by which they mean someone sufficiently compliant.in today s environment  yes  there are devs with their heads planted firmly up their backsides - whenever one of them spouts off about fans - you know their first love is activist  and development comes much further down the list.
leave devs alone  mean while devs attack elden ring because their salty af at the review score  so defo dont treat all of them with respect  just those who deserve it
so many great games are coming out from so many great creators  .. yeah ..like what and like who     while games are a buisness the product is entertainment  many games are not enternaining  ... or functionalthe execs sure are responssible for many things .... just not story  design  gameplay  levels  mechanics and chracters
phil spencer lacks testicular fortitude
well  Im first
wasteland goodfallout bad
playstation is worse then xbox nowdays tho. still sux.
yeah  no. you dont get to call me a nazI white supremacist misogynist and then demand that I treat you with respect.
anything to grift about
actually  no you didn t. the generations before you did most  if not all  of the real research and groundwork for what you claim here for yourself.. the tech that led to wifI and bluetooth for example was invented by none other than hedy lamarr  see also ada lovelace and charles babbage and their work on the analytical engine..
you do too
