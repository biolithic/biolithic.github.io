my wife had a stalker a few years ago. he tried to extort us. we had him arrested and the court still hasn t taken him to trial. gotta love our justice system. i hope your situation ends up better.
his  argument  is basically  she s documented my creepy  demented behaviour  for all to see and it s just not fair!!! please protect me from any backlash!!!
melanie  check your car for tracking devises. if he knew where you car was to leave the card a month ago  he may have left a gps device.
he says  come at me . yeah  he d like that  weirdo. don t get sucked into his insanity. stay safe and don t go anywhere near this creeper. the court will throw that sh t out and you can file a restraining order. don t stress over it and play some hogwartz
i was hoping this fool got the message a few months ago. this guy needs some serious help. i m sorry this is happening to you.  as a fellow steeler fan it sucks seeing another steeler go through this.  be safe melonie.
he is 100  trying to disarm you in more ways than one. keep your guard up and i ll add you to my prayers.
melonie  it s probably not going to stop.  it will probably escalate.  please always carry and be aware when you are out.  be safe.
i can t believe we live in a world where stalkers can stalk you using the court system to force you into their lives.
when you get a lawyer  i believe you can have them investigate if he has other women he has stalked in the past. they can get testimony from them as well. if he is stalking you then he has more than likely done so to other women. men like this have a history. stay safe!
you sound so exhausted  i m sorry you re going through this. you re handling it really well by publicly shedding light on this because monsters live in the dark
a similar thing happened to the singer sarah maclauchlin. she had a stalker so obsessed  that he brought a lawsuit against her. he did this just so that she would be required to appear in court. that way he could force her to be in the same room with him and meet her in person. there is little you can do to stop an deranged personality like that. hopefully if you stop his courtroom nonsense he will just move on to some other obsession.
15 40 that tweet from him creeped me out the most because it could be construed as a threat. what does he mean by having you  removed  from his life  i m having difficulty interpreting that as anything other than a death threat.if it s possible  try to get family or friends to stay with you so that you have back-up in case he tries anything.
he says  come at me!  when all you re trying to do is get away from him. yeah  he s the conman and creepo.  wesupportmeloniemac
this was a wild ride. glad the judge was seeing things clearly and honed in on what was actually going on. praying this situation won t bother you again!
i just realized something  you had to go into court on valentine s day. my theory is this was his  gift  to you in order to see you in court. in his mind  since he can t see you anywhere else  he decides to do this on the  day of love.  this is some criminal minds behavior. keep god  and that glock close. you will be in my prayers.
it s strange that he says things like  i want the liar out of my life.  he literally has the power to control that...just don t talk to you and block you on social media. but he doesn t seem to be able to stop himself and as we know these types of obsessive behaviors always escalate. be careful.
i m really sorry you ve been going through all this crud. . .dude can try to cover his tracks all he wants - he will have to answer for everything he s done to you when christ returns.stand strong  melonie mac!love and prayers to you
all i can say is stay vigilant and safe. it is good that you decided to share this to the public.
i m taking you to court for stalking you! hol up. wait a minute. something ain t right.
he s doing whatever he can to be a major figure in your life. positive or negative  it doesn t matter to this sort of deluded narcissist  he just wants to make sure you re thinking of him as much as possible.
i m sorry to hear that  for both you and your wife!
our justice system is at it s best when it takes place in a dark alley.
but you bet your ass if you did something about the stalker yourself you d be locked up so fast.
that s what happens when the court rooms are filled with activists and not judges.
@sik3xploit  in the u.k.criminals seem to get off with  light sentences  a vigilante striking out in frustration would get a hefty sentence. it s all messed up.
@daz  yeah it s fucked over here!
@       not in texas.
@wearemikej  guess i know where my husband and i are moving.
@blox117  nah he is a crazy person with a few screws loose. but thanks for the helpful comment
my wife had one of those she s a nurse and this was a young doctor from india that didn t even try to hide it the guy ended up losing his medical license over the whole thing.
@blox117  you know posting this might make someone contact anonymous to find info about you right  the moment you decide to troll someone with comments like this you forfeit your internet anonymity
@sub if you are against antifa and blm  tell me the full story
nah... don t ever relly on jusitce system. my friends girlfriend had also stalker  and after talking to him didn t work  he had... lets say a little accident where he got jumped by couple people  lots of bones broken  all he s teeth broken out  etc... and since than we never saw him or heard from him again...

@grapeape88  guilty until proven innocent.
@sik3xploit  we ve flooded the courts with too many victimless crimes so  there s not much bandwidth left over to handle real crimes.  we simply have too many laws.
wouldn t happen in florida. all i m saying
legal system
i love how it s the  legal system  at fault when something looks bad to the  good people  of the world own your mistakes people  learn from them help thy self and heal thy self
@wearemikej  i know 3in arkansas it s not exactly condoned either
@daz  yeah but hurt someone feelings over the internet in the uk look out.
@gondorianslayer  not in florida
damn  alf... very sorry  dude.
@       our doors are always open!
@revenge of the netherrealm everytime our government does something dumber my husband says  pack your bags  as in were moving to the us. one day soon i m gonna come home from work with our house empty and our truck packed. lol
@wearemikej  yes even in texas
@sik3xploit  oh i agree.  the intent is to always have some law they can apply to people who annoy the powers that be. if you want to live a happy life  maintain a low profile.
i m sorry to hear that  i m glad you and your wife are safe for now.
@
just make sure you don t misgender him  or you ll find yourself embroiled in a speedy trial  guilt  sentenced  and destroyed post haste...
what specific conduct do people want to be criminalized
thank you so much!
agreed 100 . praying for ya  girl!
back in the old days.. when a creep said that to a woman.. usually that woman got a few guy friends together and she did come at him.. with a army of friends who served up a giant plate of whoop ass..   am i wrong this shit wouldn t of got this far 10years ago..
yep  creeps like this were taken to the shed  and the problem would disappear instantly. nowadays  you have to protect yourself  as the police or courts cannot. if you live in a red state  get a firearm and learn how to use it.
@melonie mac go boom  yeah  don t stress over it  but get some range time as well.
thank you so much. been making calls and working with my lawyer tonight  this is gonna be handled and in good hands
wtf does being a steeler fan have to do with this  i guess if she wasn t you wouldn t care as much  lol
@drawnartist 4711   you really don t get it   supporters in the steeler community are countering a stalker  who is targeting a woman to make her feel isolated and vulnerable.  community standing up!  i m not a steelers fan yet it s obvious to me..  good on steelers fans!
@melonie mac go boom  maybe you should mary jay drunk 3po just to spite your stalker. you could do a lot worse then a guy like jay.
@j b  thanks j b.
@osu  sometimes the craziest people sound the most sane  because they really believe what they are saying.
@skinnie  who s a simp
self induced is self induced
@j b what do you mean that you re not a steelers fan  yet  ...lol! does this mean you plan on becoming one or something  that s a bit strange don t ya think  or did you accidentally say that
@gimme the pink elephant!    drawnartist 4711   you really don t get it   .... yet it s obvious to me.
look at the things we have in common
@j b  not a big sports fan so yeah i didn t know that. good info
exactly.  making a crazy person angry is a bad idea.  all these videos are doing is escalating things.
this situation is delicate  get some legal advise and keep the authorities involved at all times.
the only authority at this point is gonna have to be her friend called second amendment if this creep keeps playing around his face just might... go boom
@tea burn  i think i suggested private security to her when this first started
@culturepro  imagine not reporting videos. then something bad happens.
@kevin11humor  there is no question because obviously this dude is dangerous if he s this psychotic and relentless
@sega nerd 1991  i agree . there s only one sure way to deal with a stalker. even if they stop stalking one victim  whose to say they won t try to pull that stunt with someone else    maybe the next victim won t be so lucky. so by  taking out the trash   not only are you ensuring your own safety  but the safety of the stalker s potential future victims as well.
i d recommend melonie pack a compact 45acp that ll make the slaphead think thrice.
i agree. this is likely not his first rodeo.
@crimson priestess not necessarily. every stalker who stalks someone  not only men stalking women btw - women stalking men is equally common though much less talked about  and men stalking other men or women stalking other women also happens  starts at one point. many stalkers do in fact only stalk one person btw because they are for whatever reason fixated on that specific person. it is hard to predict the behaviour of stalkers.
@h h  not hard to bend a stalker s knee with a baseball bat.
@crazy ralph  exactly my brother i want melonie to be protected at all times that woman is fam
@jess games  i know she says she doesn t wanna contact his employer but i just thought of something what if he works somewhere where he s around female coworkers  i am a little concerned about that as well
@marcus kahn  a gun is nice  but not extremely effective  especially at short range if the person approaching seems non-confrontational or they re coming from a blind spot. a dog   a gun is best if you can t physically defend yourself.
taylor swift too.
oh  there are a few things you can do to stop guys like this. they may or may not be legal.
i noted his  removed  comment and then see that he s here in the comments.  look in the longer reply chains he doesn t get to claim he wants her on a restraining order and then show up in the comments here  but since he s a few nuts short of a squirrel he s here anyway.
hahaha  yeah exactly
while it should never happen to anyone and for the victim it s a terrifying experience  this is sadly pretty straight forward for a judge  especially if she s in a big city..they see everything you could possibly imagine and then some  so it doesn t surprise me the judge saw right through the guy. maybe i m looking at this wrong  but in my mind  just the fact she s a youtuber and he s some random guy  it s pretty obvious she wouldn t be stalking or the one out to get him  it s always the other way around when it comes to any sort of person with any level of fame or notoriety.. she s got plenty of options if she so wished  but it s clear as day he doesn t.. wonder why  it s almost like women don t like delusional and narcissistic men who show what could potentially be perceived as psychopathic tendencies within their behavior.. i just wish for her sake  other women  children  and even some men  that the court system could speed things along so she can get the restraining order against him that she needs to feel safe  and if doesn t move on with his existence  wouldn t really call it a life   then he can go to jail for any sort of contact  which includes going through a third party channel of communication.. if he is delusional enough to believe his own lies he spews  the no contact applies both ways...so if he wants rid of her and all this other crap he says while trying to turn it around on her  she won t be allowed to contact him ejther. so she ll get rid of him for a couple years through a restraining order  maintain the ability to stay armed for protection  and he ll either finally stop what he s doing or visit the inside of a jail cell  which probably isn t the first time...she should definitely remain vigilant of him  the fact he drove that many hours and never once thought  hmmm  what am i doing with my life  maybe this is a bad idea and i shouldn t be doing this   is scary.. thats a lot of time to just sit there without some sort of realization or self analysis about the situation  so yeah  he s either delusional or he just doesn t care.. not sure which is worse  to be honest  but there s no need for her to be worried about her ability to remain armed. there s no proof against her  she s the one with the proof so if they did something like that to her  then that d violate her first amendment rights at that point and she could bring a lawsuit against them..  it won t happen though  they aren t going to put a female in danger of a man like that. .
insanity!
@blox117  so you think she is stalking this dude  okay.
welcome to upside down world.
don t you just love us courts
@blox117  aw poor baby here this is for you
he s applied to the courts for access. it would be funny if it wasn t so perverse.
@wangfist  you mean the upside clown world.
@blox117  and the wheel turns on and on.   the trick is to not downgrade the situation to  gender and instead call the psyche like it is.  i ve had my own issue with this situation as a man against a female.  minding my own business and got projected that i was harassing a female for days  when i was in fact not.  her own friends had to calm her down.
@blox117  i m asking what you think. do you think that she is stalking him
there s men in this thread who ve never touch a woman.
@blox117  then why are you here  also if you were falsely accused of that  yeah sorry sucks for you mate but there are real stalkers out there who are complete creeps!
@blox117  you probably were a stalker just saying
@blox117  stop projecting onto other people and go find a life  kid.
@blox117  i just reported you so good luck with that
@cody  nice one
abusers and stalkers try to take advantage of laws to abuse disarm their victims... its why people have to be so careful in making laws so they can t be abused...
@blox117  does that mean that men don t stalk at all then  i seem to recall quite a few cases of stalking  such as shana grice that ended up being murdered from her male stalker  which was an ex.
so annoying when people erase their comments because they no longer want to be part of the conversation they perpetuated.
reminds me of that lifeguard who got sued by a woman after saving her life
did this blox117 posts get deleted
i hope this guy gets the justice he deserves  im praying for you melonie making sure that you stay safe.
man  this is a lot to deal with  of course you re in my my prayers.  i even brought it up at my church tonight in a prayer group  i didn t say all the details but i did say someone i knew online was dealing with a stalker.i found myself getting really angry at this guy  i think i needed to confront myself on that  i don t like seeing people victimized.  a few years back i went to a meeting about a local human trafficking prevention organization  and just last year i listened to a victim of it tell me her story  it wasn t easy to listen to.  i don t want to get too angry if that makes any sense  not to the point where i lose sight of common sense.  i have a mom and two younger sisters  i know how i d react if something like this were happening to them  that s probably where some of my anger came from when i heard about this on twitter originally.  i can t help by being angry and making things worse  i can merely offer what support i can in terms of prayer and encouragement to stay strong and have faith that god will make things right.thank you for saying you don t wish him harm  that puts things back into perspective of how to stand against people like this.  he says   come at me  when you re basically saying  go away   it s like the mr. miyagi philosophy of avoiding fights  i watched the karate kid again a few days ago  i guess that s still in my head .  this guy wants power and control  all bullies do and that s exactly what he is  but you re giving god control and after doing that you ve already won.i hope this was encouraging  again still in my prayers  take care melonie!!!
massive massive prayers sent your way melonie! please be aware of your surroundings and take care. so sorry this is happening to you. you don t deserve it. your faith will carry you through this  i m sure. god bless!
praying for your safety and for this guy to come to the realization of the harm he s caused.
he s using the court system to force you into his life  to pay attention to him. hopefully  any court personnel involved in the case will realize this and shut it all down.
i m so sorry you re going through this melonie  you re in my prayers.  i m older than you  but i also had a guy attach to me a few years ago.  he went to all the life classes at my church in an attempt to find me.  he made himself at home in my class and followed me wherever i went so eventually i switched churches just to get away from him.  so aggravating!  but  my unwelcome suitor eventually gave up when i didn t respond to him to him.  at all.  doggies and tasers when you re walking  stay safe.
i have donated to you  and i ve been stalked by two men before and i m a man and it was serious.  so i m sorry you have to go through this.  this creep needs to be stopped now before it gets worse.  i will continue to pray for you  but unfortunately i live states away  so my former pd and military experience can t help much. stay safe melonie and i would advise you to get a firearm if you don t already have one. if not for this guy it will help you from others.  i do have hope this will end well.  and when you go out i would advise you to ask a friend to go with you.  i know it s uncomfortable but i would also advise you to keep your firearm on you even at home.
this guy is crazy.  you definitely need to take whatever steps are necessary to protect yourself.  hopefully he stops harassing you and gets the help he needs.
i m so sorry you re still going through this  mel totally absurd situation  surely this jerk gotta be arrested!!!hang in there  all will be well
here from quartering - crazy stuff!! hopeful it s open and shut considering the judge said she would ve thrown it out given more notice. more importantly i pray this man s harassment comes to a swift end. may god have mercy on us all
his dragging this into court is just another form of control. he knows that by making you show up in court due to his actions you are forced to make an appearance to him.
poor girl  i feel so bad for melonie! she is such a sweet person and doesn t deserve any of this and should be left alone. getting court papers on valentines day because of a stalker  that is poor taste. you will win this melonie and i hope this situation never happens again! i m glad the quartering  the friday night tights crew and others have your back in this space. keep your hopes up and stay your positive self  and stay safe melonie!
keep your head up melonie  you are doing a great job with this and you definitely go boom!
holy cow!!! how much this whole thing escalated is both shocking and super uncomfortable  hopefully you get some resolution soon sorry this happened
wow that is scary. you do what you need to do to feel and stay safe. you have a great network of fans and family and friends behind you looking out for your best interests and safety also.
the anxiety is rolling off you. i m sorry  you have you to go through this. he has some severe mental issues. i m praying for your safety. thank you for keeping us updated.
you re taking the correct defense measure melonie. this snake is trying to manipulate the system for his benefit. we ll keep praying for you. keep up the good fight.
hi melonie. you got this. unfortunately this is life sometimes.
stay safe and stay strapped  psychos like that are unpredictable in their methods.
praying for you  sis.   be at peace because god will give you the victory over this situation.
yeah  this.
this.
this was my first thought the moment i saw the video title.  you nailed it.
devil may cry  my dude devil may care
he wants to do harm. i seen this tactic before.always ends badly for people like we him.
@sean sarto  i see that you are escalating.we both know where that road leads.and you don t get to claim harassment and ask for protection from someone then show up  or otherwise harass them.you do know that your posts here are counterpoint to your claims  right
that is a very insightful observation.
that and proximity to the object in question it s like a date and likely as close as he can get ... so far ......restraining orders only work if they get caught
does she have to be at court if she has a lawyer
yeah you are right. that control is narcissistic behavior. that seek for attention and control
@roberto cortez  troll zone is down the exit to the left.
the jessica yanivs  the stuttering johns  the eliza blues  the maddoxes... all of these cases should be mandatory reading to any judge engaging in internet cases!
except she is not. she shouldnt give this guy any attention. she opened a door she wont be closing for a long time now.
@androvsky  yeah  what s up with judges not reading that document beforehand  it could have avoided some if this mess.
@mista ke  your defending the creep  you must be a stalker.
@mista ke  troll zone is down the exit to the left.
@keeper protector  thanks for proving my point.
@mista_ke  goodbye now freak. support melonie or leave
@keeper protector  again  making my point. hilarious. you are not supporting her  by blowing this guy attention. you are doing her a disservice.
this dude looks like a prime candidate for an oil painting in the background of a your mom s house podcast.  you should be proud  melonie  you re being courted by royalty.  what address did he put down   i want to send feet pics  ideally farts in a jar.  i ll also put leaves in the jar   because  i have class!  just give us the po box  we ll make dreams come true!
@mista ke  if she has stayed silent it would have been worse. by not speaking about it  it is a silent okay to him to continue with what he was doing. when she blocked him  he did not stop. when she requested for him to stop trying to reach her. he did not stop. so what exacly do you mean by blowing attention  was she supposed to silently take it  why should she  what is in it for her   where do you see the benefit in not talking about it  unless you think that talking about it is going to bring danger to her  now that she did talk about it  if anything happens to her  he ll be the first suspect.
@arachnabell  how can you say that with confidence  you dont know how it would have been and now you will never know. you are all up on assumptions and self defense of behaviour that isnt in the best interest of anyone but fear.
@mista ke  thank you for proving my point...
@mista ke  that is silly to say. considering all the actions taken against her. your belief in humanity is praise worthy. especially considering the fact that all kinds of atrocious stuff happens to people every single second while we have this funny conversation.
@arachnabell  so  put the thousands of assaults every 24 hours to scale of population and the good still prevails.
@mista ke  ignoring reality around you has never been my thing in life   sorry. in those thousands of assaults you mentioned  it could be you. and if it is not you  it means it is someone else that has to suffer. this discussion is meaningless. if you want to have your rose tinted glasses on and live your life like that. that is your own choice. dont push it on others around you. the rest of us can make our own choice. and that also includes melanie.
@arachnabell  how am i ignoring reality  arent you just coping that it isnt me  geesh.
@mista ke  because you think you know what s best for this situation that has nothing to do with you.. ok
@mista ke  not my fault you are being blind on purpose. as i said suit yourself. you live how you want to live. i don t intend to live like that. and that is a choice i can make for myself. guilt tripping does not work on me so you can stop trying.
@arachnabell  blind on purpose  you are trying to be argumentative for no reason. everything i have seen here is just toxicity from everyone.
@mista ke  i don t care.
even during a horrific event like this  melonie still shows amazing class and grace.this is why my daughter loves her so much.class act!good luck with this dirtbag and staf safe !btw - he will get a wife .  in prison!
i am so sorry you have to deal with this guy. i hope and pray that everything goes through smoothly in your favor  and just know we are here for you
it s so insane. the guy is deranged. he s been the problem and melonie has only tried to stay safe.
hopefully things work out for the better  good luck and good fortune to come.
stay safe  mel! let s hope the justice system does what it s supposed to do in this case!
these stalkers need to stop. it s a mental illness and way too common practice.  porn and other sexual content  has deluded these creeps minds.   prayers for your safety.  stay safe and stay strapped melonie.
wow girl  my heart hurts for you. i also have had issues with stalkers. just blocking after telling them to leave you alone doesn t work. i know new accounts get made.  considering all that s been done  you are handling it so well. especially putting faith in god  using proper avenues of the legal system  and being aware how to protect yourself. making the situation aware to others around you was the smartest thing you could do  especially on stream. i personally  had a man fly from florida to my state.  just kept trying to contact me every way possible even though they were blocked creating new account each time  telling me he was here and he better see me.  this guy didn t know where i lived or anything just a roundabout idea of the city i lived in which is very large. these people can truly be scary. i pray the lord keeps you safe and like another viewer of yours stated  keep doing you re awesome work. and not letting this person disrupt your life  which is what they want. having the focus put on him. these people are for sure sick. i know this is emotionally and psychologically draining. obviously everyone can see that this person not acting like a normal person. i hope the courts punish him and also i hope they dont even give into his pathetic form of control by a reverse harassment charge. commonly that s what these manipulators try to do because they want dominance and to keep that person in their life no matter what means. even though you were never in their life. you re in my prayers. you just keep moving forward girl.
this is so weird! that guy needs. he s seriously messed up in the head.  be careful and be safe  melanie.really hope this mess blows over.stalkers are just so creepy  dude.stay safe. take care  hope that freak gets bent already.
it s good you re documenting this.  my wife and i have you in our prayers.
praying for your safety! i can t imagine how scary and stressful this experience has been.
praying for you melonie. stay strong and stay armed.
if you feel your life is in jeopardy  reach out. i ll be where ever you need me  whenever you need me. you will be safe. i m sorry you re going through this. lots o love from fl. you got this.
i had my own brand of stalker when i was in the army. you re making the appropriate moves and i encourage you to stay safe. keep a brave face  friend. these demented folk have a habit of getting their comeuppance one way or another.
this tool has probably been through this kind of case before. which is why he s trying to get an order of protection against you. but this guy is beyond bat shit crazy. stay safe melonie and good luck with this psychopath.
we know you have faith so you don t need to hear this from us but you re not alone and we re here for you melonie. the fellowship s got your back!
hey mel  hang in there...  your platform is the perfect place to gain awareness for his actions.   hopefully he hasnt done this to anyone else!!
stay strong melonie! it s very important to document all of this shit that he s putting out and sending to you for the police. my friend did just this and the police hand a very good handling of the situation and the stalker stopped completely after that.
holy shit this dude is nuts... i pray you have lots of people around you at all times and please be armed. be safe.
i m so sorry you are going through this! i m praying for you!
this is why you need a big brother to gently speak to him  with a bat. big brother here!
she doesn t deserve any of this. it s so disheartening to see her frustrated and upset. let s be sure to diligently keep praying for melonie. she can absolutely win this fight.
he s also playing a dangerous game pissing off her fans
i guess this is the price for being a good looking female gamer on youtube  that still doesn t excuse the choices people like this make. life is all about choice  and he chooses to be a creep.
i d say for her to trust the justice system to do its job  but........well  we know what usually happens with that.....
@blox117  i m curious if your sister or mother or wife or whoever said that some guy was creepily following them would you have that same attitude  i d hope not for their sake but maybe i m assuming too much!
@otterloopb she brought it upon her self once again ..she cultivated an audience to protect her persona and interests ..to the extent they will threaten others in her name  garbage
@palladiamors  yeah you re right about that. my brother s crazy  obsessed ex gf tried to get a restraining order because he broke up with her. she failed the first time and got humiliated and then found another judge a few days later to give it to her. apparently you can just keep trying over and over until you find a moron judge to take your side.
@sean sarto  typical stalker victim blame.sean  take the hint.seriously.
@charly lucky  she already has all of that. and i don t think in texas that you have to have a cc permit
@the real stephentv   that s what i get for commenting before watching video. i just heard her mention something about that.
@the real stephentv  no we don t  it s a new change but a good one.
@sean sarto  you need professional help.
thank you so much  god bless you!
@melonie mac go boom  praying for you... i will put you on my prayer list at church if you want.
@volkaneke thanks for showing heartfelt respect and support. when i get next paycheck i ll give too. just wanted to say that    how this harassment to mel upsets me too.
@bushinryucat i feel you. we all do what we must and when we can. it is very upsetting and i m actually genuinely humbled and inspired by how gracefully melonie carries herself throughout this whole episode.
@melonie mac go boom  if all else fails  go boom.
yes!
if this creep is trying to get you disarmed  he clearly has bad intentions. obviously we knew that already  but he s certainly still trying and apparently won t give up. keep your aim sharp  and stay alert. i m praying for you  along with many others.
damn. sucks to hear this is happening to you. stay safe!
it s scary because melonie is not the only girl on youtube that this is happening to . are people getting more crazy as time passes or with the internet  they are more visible   stay safe and stay alert !
this dude is a psycho lol hope you get everything worked out you seem like a great person melonie. watched you on fnt and tuesday nights main events you re great!
so sorry you re going through this nightmare. lifting you up in prayer.
girl i m so sorry you re going through this. but you might have to get ruthless if he doesn t knock it off.
good grief. i m so sorry you re going through this  melonie.also  i didn t realize you were weaponized with a stick of butter.ridiculous.
hope everything works out for you. seems pretty straightforward but knowing today s clown world  you never know.
ive been in a situation where people tried to alter the truth... luckily john 17 17 came through  and it will come through for you. prayers going out to you  and keep going strong!
sorry you are having to go through this. hope it gets resolved soon.
so sorry to hear all this mel. noone should have to go though this  all this. god bless you keep up the great work on your videos
wow  that is creepy. praying for you melonie
seriously will any court in the world believe that melonie agreed to go on a date with some shady middle-aged guy she never met before ! !
thanks for the update. prayers for you and for a quick end to this insanity!
sorry that this is happening to you. hopefully  you get it sorted soon. stay strong
that s a really weird thing to do  to someone he s that obsessed with. especially on valentines day of all days. dragging a woman whom he s obsessed with  into court and projecting his own crimes onto the one he s obsessed with. he needs good amount of help.
i saw the quartering s video  came over and subbed  praying for your safety and hope this is resolved as quickly as possible.  it reminds me of something my wife went though and you shouldn t have to go though this...one tip though is please surround yourself with close friends that you personally know and family.
i m sorry you re still having to deal with this. stay safe  girl.
i think you re spot-on with the disarming thing. you being at the gun range has literally nothing to do with this  and a restraining order is sadly something that would make someone a prohibited person.
sorry to hear your woes  hope it all works out for you.  i live in florida  i pray that you stay safe  remain armed  and receive proper justice in this matter.  if you do come to florida  would love to meet you and if you need some protection  plenty of my buds will watch your back.
in response to your question  yes
@thedevilyouknow
given the court systems nowadays yes i d believe it  it s so corrupt it s disgusting!
tons of young women do stuff like that. she s not young though...she s 36.
@jeffmcc93  i mean that s young but i thought she was much younger closer to my age i turned 22 on january
we should give the judge some props she was great
he ain t middle-aged  he s old  lol.
not just that.. the fact he thought that the justice system would believe she d even stalk him
@dying rose  do you know what middle aged means
@heroickitten  meh. his hair is gray  he s 50ish looking. he s old.now if you really want to get technical nobody is old compared to the patriarchs. we re like children to them.
@dying rose  i have gray hair and im early 30 s lol
@dying rose  50 is not old  plenty of women in their 30s find 50yo guys attractive. the problem s not his age  it s his mind.
@tony romano  i beg to differ
your honor  order her to get into my truck!  - stalker creep
he looks creepy af  too.
@ranmouri82  he would look absolutely normal if you didn t know he s nuts.
unfortunately  restraining orders don t work that well. you see it all the time on networks like investigation discoveryi recommend you keep your head on a swivel  and carry at all times if you can. we re all here for you  girl!
be strong.  hope things clear up soon.
takecare melonie  stay safe!! don t let this get to u!
i m sorry you going through some rough times. i know this year hasn t been going so well so far for a lot of people.
9 02 great response! if he doesn t desist  you do need to press criminal charges. nobody wants to do that but when things get out of hand  you need to protect yourself. good luck!
that whole  she s using her audience against me  was a total lie! no creator can control what their audience can and can t do! you can tell them not to harass or dox someone  but if that person decides to do it! there s nothing you can do about it! that dudes ridiculous! sorry this happened melonie! hopefully this doesn t ruin any fan interactions in the future! stay safe!
it must be crazy frustrating to deal with this. keep carrying  keep training with your weapon so if you ever have to use it  it will be second nature. mostly try to live your life and don t let this pathetic mental case stress you out.god bless and prayers for you
sorry this happened to you. glad you made this public so we can be on the lookout for this creep  too.
it really sucks that you have to deal with crazy people.  i hope you stay safe.
praying onward! your handling this with tremendous grace. god bless!
people like him usually won t stop until they re forced to - either by going to jail or court ordered medical treatment.stay safe  melonie! we support you!  3
so basically the crazy stalker pulled a reverse uno  no u  on you. you couldn t write this shit. stay safe and stay armed
what a pathetic  sad  sad little man. stay safe  stay strapped and stay vigilant. came from the quartering after jeremy did a video about your ordeal.
sorry you have to deal this kind of insanity  miss mac. hope you get the protection you need from this sick individual.
hopefully this situation goes away asap. stay safe.
man mel   so sorry that this is still going on. hopefully this will end soon so you don t have to keep enduring this.
the fact you look so peaceful with this. i would be freaking out!
the kindergarten swears are killing me. reminds of a drill instructor i had in boot. he was meaner than a bulldog but refused to curse. it was hilarious.
you got this  melonie.  it sucks that you have to deal with this.  good luck with everything!!
good that you have the ability to document and share this on youtube.  i feel for those who do not.
i can hear the stress in your voice  stay safe and god bless you!
well  then her  audience  is at fault for giving him power over her.
i m more bothered by yt colleagues milking the case  especially because she said she s only talking about here for safety measures.
@mista ke  what  you are giving him power  annabeiie  by blaming the audience and not his semantics game ffs
@mista ke  because she told her audience he stalks her   she s defending herself posting the real videos the guy himself made.
@mista ke  your weird. you want to hurt her don t you
@dennisthemenace  no  publicly shaming someone who did you wrong  regardless how you feel about it is not self defense  it s reckless abandon.
@mista ke  it isn t publicly shaming for the sake of shame. it is his fault he behaves shamefully. good for her and us all that these videos this man himself made are now in the public view. shame on you for acting shamefully and condemning the necessary behavior to protect others.
@mista ke  explain your logic. cause thats sounds incomprehensible.
@rotor13  his logic doesn t exist. he s been in the comments blaming everyone else for what the stalker is doing. he s very likely an abuser himself.
@immortalslayer90  yup. thats exactly why i said its incomprehensible logic
@dennisthemenace  i disagree. i dont think you should give them any light of the day and bury them in courtcase after courtcase until they dont want any smoke from anyone. this is 4th grade behaviour. but go on with your perverted sense of selfinduced justice.
a female can get a bunch of sims to do something simply by crying and telling a story
@rotor13  my man  in this silly little world  where you guys boast to be correct  always keep in mind there is someone that is smarter and he wont meet your expectations of what s considered smart. hope i m wrong  but those results in a court of law have already been established  so pray this guy doesnt get a great lawyer.
thank you so much  i appreciate you
i think you might have just given mindy an idea for season 2 of velma.
i had a coach like that in high school.  it s hard to keep a straight face when being addressed with those non curse words .
if he hurts you. he hurts himself.   love ya mel
i m sorry you had to live through that  melonie. we have your back. crazy stuff. i wonder how many female you tubers or on twitch have gone though stuff like that cause people make up stuff in their own minds. anyway best wishes.
yes  absolutely  lawyer up. deranged nutcases like these only ever escalate their pattern of behavior. he s already proven he s willing to go to ridiculous lengths to stalk and harass you. stay safe and aware. praying for you
for what it s worth i m sorry you are going through this. i hope more people know that his kind is rare and not at all approved by most men
hey  while i appreciate the content you make.  i can also appreciate the seriousness of your situation and i fear for your safety. you have the support of your community  just be careful what you tell your community now that courts are involved.  some of my biggest struggles going through court meant i had to keep quiet until i was able to unload all my evidence to the courts.  but leading up to it  i had to watch what i said.  just be careful  and stay awesome.  also keep making awesome content.
melonie i am so sorry you have to experience this. it s noticeable you re shaken up. please be careful  we ll pray for your safety and that god may help resolve this issue.
sorry to hear this is getting more out of hands. keep your chin up and stay safe. glad the judge had common sense and saw through it.
some only live because they push others beneath the waves. you ve made the the right call letting the community know  for your own safety. we ve got your back mac.
i had a stalker when i was a young boy. it was a terrifying experience. luckily my parents took care of it  when no one else would. take care  be vigilant  i ll be praying for the best outcome for you.
whatever you do . stay alert with your surroundings!  if can   be with those you trust!
keep us updated if more happens  please.  this guy is working my last nerve
i feel sorry for you. i hope it all stops and i hope the best for you and you always be happy.
i am here because josiah rises mentioned you. you are in my prayers and i am sorry you are going through this. i have a sister and two nieces. so what you are going through is horrible. in prayer for you.
i wish you the best  and good luck with court. i believe you will get through this. i m praying for you.
this is literally insane. i m so sorry you have to deal with this  will be praying that it gets resolved soon and he leaves you alone
i hope everything will be okay  this situation sounds like a real drag
wow...melonie i hope it all works out ok for you! this guy is crazy!
sad you have to go through this.  keep strong.
i feel like this man did all this stuff to be involved in your life directly and he got some sick satisfaction from it knowing this circus is the only way you would acknowledge him at all so this guy will probably not give up and might actually be  quite dangerous if he doesn t get some help or drop his obsession
hi melonie. i m very sorry you are going through this. it is of course the dark side of internet fame. you are an attractive person with a smart  strong personality - that always brings the crazies. i think you are doing the correct thing here. shine light on it. you will prevail! meanwhile  at the end of all of this  you ll still be you  and he will still be him! all the best
i m assuming an ass whooping and a trip in the trunk when you say  my parents took care of it
was it a woman
@nicks jacku  he wouldn t know unless he s a biologist.
@curseseer  you missed an opportunity  smh
damn.... i m sorry to heard that and hopefully you doing okay. stay safe.
thank you so much  3
this reminds me of the psychopath that stalked me in 2009. truly disturbing individuals actually hacked my facebook and posted mlp corn on there. let s just say i m not allowed on fb anymore
these actions are just his way of keeping you in his life  and in his mind  it s the only way he can exert control over you. keep documenting everything like you have been and stay vigilant.
i hope everything goes your way and this creep backs off. i still don t get how he can keep harassing you and at the same time think he has anything he can use against you in court. i hope you can get a restraining order. as scary as this must be for you  stay strong and know people are on your side.
i m so sorry that you have to go through this! you are a beautiful person and don t deserve this.
i m so sorry you re dealing with all this insanity. i m praying for you.
glad to hear the judge is good on this. stay safe. will definitely keep praying for you.
guys like him are f-ed up  stay safe and vigilant! dont let yourself get disarmed  maybe stay with familiy for a while  hope all best for you!
people like him never stop unfortunately. there might be a lull in activity but it tends to come back in waves. i m sorry you re dealing with this  stalking is a serious danger.
stay safe melonie  please be very careful.
so  mr. notstalker  you re claiming this 120lbs woman is stalking you  and you re afraid for your safety.  what s your evidence that she s stalking you   she s said she s being stalked by me  blocked me on social media so i had to make a ton of alt accounts  had an event where a bunch of fans  including me  could come for a meet and greet  and might come to florida some day.  uh... i asked what s your evidence that she s stalking you...
i m so sorry you have to deal with this bs.  i know from experience how scary stalker situations can be.
so sorry you re having to deal with that. remember to go to the range as often as you can  so you feel confident and comfortable to protect yourself.god bless!
we re with you  all the best  take care of yourself.
we re praying for you  melonie. let us know if you need anything. we are called to take on one another s burdens  and this is pretty big.
sorry melonie nobody should go through this. i have been in the courts in and out for years now to get custody of my two boys  and my insane abusive ex wife keeps lying and dragging it out. i know it s not the same  but just know i feel ya. it ll get better!
please keep yourself safe! praying for you  and that he stays far away from you.
you are born looking like your parents but you die looking like your decisions.he has made some very poor choices in his life.  praying for you melonie.
at this point  if you see him irl you are fully within your rights to start blasting  no questions asked. this is insane.
how scary.    stay safe.  stay strong. you will be in our prayers.  i hope that lunatic will find peace and leave you and others alone.
i m sorry you have to go through this.  praying for you. that this goes away and that you re safe. praying it all gets better.
please be safe. make sure your neighbors know. if i had the ability to check in on you i d do it  but i m  not very local.
melanie this sucks you re going through this.  take care of yourself and never relent.
that is crazy. hope they stop him for you and you can feel safe on-wards.
best thing i can say is keep documenting everything and take every measure to be safe
be safe melonie
stay safe melonie  i cannot imagine how this must feel  it s quite scary.
stalkers don t go away. if they did  they wouldn t be very good at stalking. stay safe!
wow!  i m really speechless on this whole scenario.  i hope this gets resolved soon   he understands how to cease   desist before this gets worse.   praying for your safety   a swift  peaceful resolution.
god help us all  nobody should have to go through this i m sorry you do melonie. why on earth would this person think he has a court case suing someone for not wanting them  he looks like he shouldn t be anywhere near small children. i d counter sue if possible for damages in dealing with it  and definitely get a restraining order. stay safe
sorry you re having to deal with this stuff  melonie. praying for you.
god bless and protect you melonie  in jesus  name!
to say this guy has a screw loose would be an extreme understatement.
keep safe  mel. i knew a guy kind of like this. not this bad  but he had his problems. pretty much every response  not just verbal responses  feeds his delusions. i m not surprised he used those things that make him look bad as evidence. there s nothing you can do or say that will convince him otherwise. the guy eventually snapped out of it and realized what he was doing  was wrong. but you can t count on that.
melonie  definitely talk to an attorney asap. you need a restraining order against him  for starters. have you contacted twitter about this  i don t know if they can or are willing to do anything. i know the court appearance was stressful but  on the flip side  there is now something on record.
stay safe  young lady. there are a lot of people twisted too tight nowadays!
always in your corner! just glad that your okay sucks your going through this
i ll keep you in my prayers ms. mac...god bless.
i m really sorry u have to put up with this  this guy needs a serious reality check it s infuriating me seeing this going on
stay strong  mel. never forget you have a great community who loves you and is behind you.
we all think you are a wonderful person. you are very personable and relatable. any lawsuit against you would probably be frivolous. the stalker wants to use the courts to keep the stalking a secret. that s not why we have courts. live your life and be free.  old school lara croft rules.
very smart move making these videos all the receipts and all need to be kept. your def handling this correctly and smartly
thank you so much  i really appreciate the support
@melonie mac go boom  god help you melonie! you ll win this and we re all so sorry that this asshole who s clearly not well in the head at all and i m not using that as an excuse because nothing can or will ever excuse it  is doing this to you  it s so wrong  i m confused by this whole scenario and i can t even imagine the effect it s had on you but i sympathize with you and i pray to god for you  that things get better for you!
@blox117  so sympathy equates to simping in your mind
@blox117  here come the red pill folk lol
@blox117  yes so what r u doing here then kid
@henry gambles  they probably stalk women too
@sega nerd 1991  ah i see! how sad they have to stalk women for any woman to notice them at all!
@henry gambles  dr. evil  riiiight.
@john bishop  everytime they say something  prepare for maximum stupidity  like if you think it can t get dumber  somehow it does!
@blox117  100  there s more going on than what s being said here
@sega nerd 1991  i think you re replying to the wrong person.   do u honestly think that s  ! is ok   well... melanie is a terrible person so i don t care.
@roberto cortez  so that s a yes
@roberto cortez  so ur making multiple accounts under different names to harass her some more i c
@sega nerd 1991  multiple accounts
yeah
@roberto cortez  this beta cant handle the fact that there s more than one guy more masculine than him that doesn t simp for chicks online
@henry gambles  literally everyone here is phat compared to me
@blox117  yeah sure you do! let me guess  you also got the mona lisa
i remember hearing about this in december and seeing that group of men help out in some way. on valentine s eh  dang sorry to hear that.  i ll keep you in my prayers  3
very sorry you have to go through this mel stay safe
what a valentines gift.. court papers. yay ! seriously i hope this issue gets resolved asap and you can live your life in peace  mel. bless you.
praying for you  stay safe.
i started following you  after your interview with colin moriarty on sacred symbols plus. you are awesome  and my wife and i love your humor and videos. i m sorry this is something you have to deal with. thank you for being transparent.
damn... stay strong mel.  _  i wish i could help more but all i can do is praythis guy irritates me so much  _ those of us that believe and ask god for answers  sigh man  why.... o_o mel  i know you dont have a mean bone in your body... but dont be afraid to crush this guy  _  unfortunately... it may be the only way to snap him out of this delusion  sigh wowshout out to the quartering    heard about this update through him
keep up your training melonie take care and go boom.
wow. i d say you re handling this situation well.
few things piss me off more than mess like this. may the lord give you wisdom and endurance  and may this situation completely end as soon as possible.
praying for ya melonie.  no one deserves to be in this situation.
sorry that this entire situation blew up this much. hopefully it gets settled soon and you stay safe. god bless.
behind you 100  mel. stay safe!
glad you got a great judge and i hope this blows over soon. i ll have to catch a hogwarts legacy stream at some point
a good guy for advice on all this creepy stuff is honestly cecil
sorry to that a decent human being such as yourself is having to go through this. stay strong
get all your evidence in a row  talk to that lawyer  beat this frivolous case first ao you can remain strapped for protection. the fund jeremy set up for your lawyer will help immensely. i donated    and hopefully maybe you have friends or family to stay with until you get a full restraining order  have a drink  relax and play some hogwarts. keep your sanity and stay safe girl. you re awesome!
keep your ducks lined up and keep all the evidence and if there are intra-state stalking and defamation laws borkne as this is the only way he can be a nuisance in your life. be strong and stay the course   melanie
sorry you re going through all this. i wish there was something we could do to help  but it sounds like you re already handling it.
thanks for explaining all of this  didn t know it was that serious!
i know how horrible this is. had a former abuser try and use the law to force interactions with me and force me into court mandated therapy.  stay strong and remember to take lots of deep breaths.
yeah  there is a term for it  it is called  court stalking.
the old  serve her a court order on valentine s day trick  stay safe melonie.
praying for your safety and the swift stop to this madness.
i definitely would not be handling this situation so competently. keep it up  melanie. stick to your guns  in every sense  and stay safe!
do not let this get to you  its what he wants i m sure. take care of yourself keep yourself safe.
god bless and stay safe  melanie.
dude is creepy  he s seemingly dangerous and best to carry against bad guys like this.
my worry now is that he s trying to force you to meet him ... in court  sure there s better but for him it s still a win. crazy how a random guy can so easily ruin someone else s life.
general advice for everyone  don t talk about pending or active litigation. let your attorney handle this  if you don t have one get one.praying for you melonie  be strong and know you are not alone in this.
i truly cant wait to see where parasocial relationships lands us in a decade.
keep yourself safe melonie.  make sure friends and family always know where you are at all times and probably worth getting things like a panic alarm or some pepper spray in case the situation does escalate just to be safe.  god bless
glad you got this sorted. that is all just crazy. sorry you have had to deal with someone like that. stay safe!
lawyer up and get your attorney to send him a cease   desist. keep on keeping a paper trail  document everything. stay safe!
the sad fact is that nobody is ever truly  safe.  people used to know this  but now they don t seem to. i hope this situation works itself out peacefully and swiftly.
i am so sorry that you have to deal with this situation. the sweater looks nice. do talk to a lawyer and get a restraining order.
really sorry that you re having to go through all of that. i hope you re considering taking a restraining order on him. also  maybe having surveillance cameras might be something to think about  just to be safe.  i said a short pray for you just now too. dont know if it will help  but it couldn t hurt.  in the mean time try  to keep your chin up.btw i ve been watching some of  your videos and just realized that i hadn t subscribed yet. so i changed that.
sorry u going through this melonie  stay safe
this is a victory and i hope you walk away better from it. i hope you re happy to have friends that will stand by you and know that you re not alone in this crazy world. and i m sure there s been a bunch of people commenting and support as well.
melonie  my wife is a insurance agent this happened a few times to her. i hope you cc and know how to use it well  like my wife. my wife has old friends in the cometary that have restraining orders. best to you  my wife and i just said a prayer for you. i just seen jeremy s video and started typing here when i arrived. glad your a avid 2nd. amendment woman and you you hit the range
if this gets too drawn-out and messy  you might contact jeremy at the quartering for advice. he and  super lawyer  bill should be able to help.
i m always impressed by your ability to not swear.
depending on local laws  one item can make you much safer.
as a man  i can t help but feel somewhat outraged by this man and what he s doing to you. i m sorry you have to go through with this.
my brother and sister in law had to go to court on valentine s day to prosecute a dude who was trespassing on their property. it was also their anniversary i guess it s a theme.
i m sorry to hear that this stalker doesn t leave you alone. i can imagine how hard it is for you. my thoughts and prayers are with you.
i m sorry that you had to go through something like that the best thing to do is to post a becareful and to watch out for the guy in every social media
you can do this melonie. keep fighting the good fight and god bless you!
please be safe melanie mac
please be okay and safe  ms. melonie
this is an extreme flaw in our court system. reminds me of billy mitchell suing everyone for saying he s a liar and cheat. sure it ll almost certainly be dismissed very quickly  but it still ties people up in frivolous lawsuits. please carry everywhere you go mel.
hope you re ok... i think you are handling it all really well.  please take care of yourself
hope you stay strong and beat this. god bless.
that s what he wants is for you to be tired and scared. don t lose your edge. you have the evidence and be strong.  you are in my prayers as well
good job  absolutely ridiculous that he took it this far knowing he had no chance. hope he gets what he deserves!
it s always the cute girls stalking the creepy old guys... jkglad you re doing everything to can to keep safe  you never know what these psychos are capable of!
i see this going one way. i wouldn t go anywhere alone and always carry. stay safe
i would just ask my future wife for dinner  not to court  wishing you strength in this situation  just sad that a random psycho can mess up your life like this.
stay safe and stay composed. this type of people will get pettier and pettier in an attempt to lure you down to their pettiness level. and when you re down there  they ll just beat you through experience. so don t let that happen to you.
these guys are difficult to get rid of and will latch on to you and attempt to take you down with them.i pray this is resolved quickly and without too much stress. take care of your mental health during this process and god bless.
sadly  things are getting more and more difficult for good god loving folks who want to share truth in the world. it doesn t help that this man has a unhealthy obsession with this poor girl. stay safe melonie! don t give up the good fight.
just gonna wish you good luck melonie
im so sorry this is happening to you. please stay safe! this guy is clearly unhinged. with all the evidence you have you would think this would be dismissed without a thought  its crazy to me how people like this are very rarely held accountable. will keep you in my prayers
lol imagine the judge seeing mel on one side and this guy on the other saying  she s stalking me!
make arrangements to stay with someone who is  equiped  to keep you safe ahead of time and be prepared in case it goes sideways. it can go bad fast.
i had a stalker who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons. it took me dumping a bucket of water over her for her to take the hint
the guy is angry that he can t have you so he wants no one to have you. be careful and get a lawyer.
it s good to know your safe  when i didn t see you put a new video on your  other channel  it told me something wasn t right. but you and brittany venti are having some really crazy spychos come after both of you  and i hope this guy and eliza get taken care of in the best way possible. but sorry to hear your valentines day wasn t too great either. either way hang in their god will take care of this  and you will win just like brittany will win also.
i m amazed that this is getting as far as it is. stay safe.
melonie  i just heard about this  from jeremy  thequartering .  you should counter-sue him for all travel  court  attorney expenses plus damages - emotional  monetary   time lost from being able to produce on yt   stalking  etc.  you should also pursue any   all criminal charges available to her while you re there   obtain an indefinite protection order against him there.  then get another one in your state.
he may be crazy but he has good taste in waifu. if only he could pair it with good sense smh hope all goes well for you and he leaves you alone.
hang in there melanie. we see this dude for what he is. raise the cap on your gsg you ll need it but you have the support. sorry you gotta do l deal with this bs.
i pray you stay safe.  keep your piece close to you.  will be praying he stays out of your life. god bless you melonie!
the stalker didn t thought about the army of supporters you have. justice is always on your side.
from what i ve heard you stated so far this man is unhinged and it s just going to escalate unfortunately. and yes he was attempting to put a restraining order on you in order to get you disarmed in order to have a better chance of attempting something against you. the fact is going to go this extent shows how dangerous he is  hopefully you have a really good security system outside your home recording in and out just in case.
i wonder. you may be able to reach out to twitter or instagram support and let them know you have an active court case on harassment and see if they have any data as to what comment the stalker was blocked for.
keeping you in my prayers melonie. you know what to do  stay focused on jesus and cling to his word and you will grow stronger in this.
i am so sorry that you are going through this.  i met you several years ago at a pak east convention you are a very sweet and kind person. you do not deserve something like this.  i will be praying for you and sending you strength to make it through this.
hold the line melonie! please stay safe. too many psychos like this guy out there
if he wasn t a stalker  he d take a few simple steps to defuse this  all the while avoiding being harassed as he might claim.
you did the right thing showing up -- never let the psycho be the only one talking to the court  and so glad you had a good judge . please let everyone know if you need to raise funds for legal representation. don t let this hurt you in even more ways.
hey melanie  just make sure that whatever you re posting or telling us is ran by a lawyer first just in case if there s some thing that could screw over a case in your favor
there should be more laws against stalkers they keep on harras you.
wow. that is some story. i m sorry that you have to deal with this. there is some really creepy people specially on the internet. do what you gotta do to stay safe.
thank you so much  this means a lot. god bless you
tho with all the info you have i doubt it s needed
he is too insane. you deserve justice.
wow that really sucks. i can t imagine having to worry about something like that. keep the zap zap close. on the bright side you have a lot of support.
sorry to hear about this insanity. i don t normally watch you or your channel  jeremy clued me in  but i ve got my fingers crossed that this weirdo gets what is coming to him  legal penalties and restraints  and fast.hang in there.
this happened to me before as well.  the fbi got involved and put an end to it.
keep on keeping on melonie. lots of us are backing you and sending . i told my wife about your situation. she got a cold  steely look in her eye and said  it s a good thing we are poor. otherwise we would be visiting the usa...and this psycho would have me to deal with! . my wife has a mean right hook and does not fight fair lol
sadly  about all you can do at this point is take out a ppo against him  since it s clear he has been willing to travel long distances to try to interact with you.  it s fortunate you got a judge who seems to understand technology and social media well enough to not just take his word at face value.  stay safe!
i m so sorry you re dealing with this  i thought it was over with.  i seriously hope everything is okay and that you re safe. it s so unfortunate you have to waste your time for these creeps. i m praying for your safety and protection. god s keeping his eyes on you  i wish you a wonderful day despite some weirdo trying to make things hard for you.
i think that s the first time i ve ever heard mel get high pitched aggravated at a situation. hopefully this will be all he can do and he can just move on with his life. so that you can continue enjoying yours. sending prayers and  sanity your way. it ll get better.
we got your back  melonie. keep your head up
for future reference  melonie  if you encounter persons or entities you no longer wish to interact with  send them a message  letter  etc... stating the following   this is an official and legally binding cease and desist order  you are no longer to contact me  except to state that you will no longer contact me. if you fail to comply  i will initiate official proceedings.   take a screenshot  recording  etc.. as evidence and file it away where you can lay hands on it at a moments notice.
sad update but praying for a good outcome  the man is obviously unhinged.
dam  this got crazier i hope all end up well
so you think that it s an attempt to disarm you so he can do something...that s frightening. creepy as well. stay safe melonie we love you  in a normal non-stalker way.
in-f ing-sane! stay strong  girl!
sorry to hear you are still having to put up with this guy. keep staying true though  god will enter into even this. he ll wish it was just you he had to deal with.glad to hear you re doing your due diligence to legally protect yourself as well. be safe.
you re too kind. i d definitely get him fired.
this is insane! sending all love and good things to you!  hello from
i m really sorry that u are having to deal with this. it will all work out. hang in there
as if life isn t challenging enough then you have to deal with this crap. be safe  me and the mrs. are praying for you
i am so sorry that you are having to go through this. i am glad that you carry and are taking smart precautions. you are in my prayers. psalm 118 10-14all the nations surrounded me but in the name of the lord i cut them down.they surrounded me on every side but in the name of the lord i cut them down.they swarmed around me like bees but they were consumed as quickly as burning thorns in the name of the lord i cut them down.i was pushed back and about to fall but the lord helped me.the lord is my strength and my defense he has become my salvation.
thank you so much  this means a lot
@melonie mac go boom  you are very welcome
holy crap melonie  that dude is seriously unhinged. stay safe out there.
i hope you can get past that guy please be safe
just another reason why gun control should never be considered. don t take this the wrong way  but you re tiny. being armed is the only true defense you have in situations like this. there s a reason they call it the great equalizer. i really hope you are able to get past all of this as soon as possible. thanks for the update ms. mac!
oh wow.. i was hoping that this was over after your initial video. i m sorry that you are going through this..
damn this situation is stressing melonie out. i hope you re okay.
very glad you had a good judge.
i can relate in some way. many years ago i had a harassment case against a  fellow employee for him and a few of his freinds threatening me for weeks.this was over me pulling him up for a lie he made in the staff cafetaria room. i got free legal advice and documented the harassment that followed. guy was a coward who got freinds to grab and threaten me. as i m a fairly tall guy and capable of defending myself one on one. i sued the company sucessfully for failing to take action too.  good that melanie had documented everything . stay safe melanie.and i hope this doesn t affect your life too much.
this dude is a insane creepo  what the hell is wrong with him  praying everything works out for you
i m sorry he s putting you through this kind of nonsense. you don t deserve to be harassed like this. i hope you can make some headway within the system and get the help you need to stop this maniac. try to stay positive mel !
hey  i m not familiar with you or your channel. i just heard about your situation from jeremy at the quartering. i came here to see your update video and i want to say that i m hoping it all works out and this guy leaves you alone  but it seems like the police may have to stop him. i hope you don t end up having to protect yourself. it sounds like he has no intention of stopping on his own.
i have mentioned this on here before. i know a young lady who posted modeling pictures online  not sex pictures. she felt it was innocent fun  liked the likes  which is common in this generation . a man fell in love with her through the photos  no contact of any kind  and showed up and beat her to the point she was in the hospital for months and will never be the same. i just want to say  be careful and be careful on all social media platforms. there are some seriously crazy people out there and you gotta assume they are violent and dangerous.
judge    is this a joke    holds up your picture.  then holds up his picture.   who do you think i think is stalking who
the guy is clearly nuts. stay safe melonie.
stay with family and friends until it s resolved. praying for you and praying that this man finds jesus and gets rid of that evil controlling his mind. stay armed at all times. god s got you! remember that!
wow  the judge part cracked me up. can t believe people are so delusional.
melanie  get protection - that guy is a head-case.he s a classic stalker profile.you need to get a restraining order on him.
never had a good feeling about this from when you made the first video  especially since you said he had placed a card on your windshield at the event. i was worried about your safety thinking he may have continued the stalking and you d had another run in with him closer to home when you had mentioned the issue again yesterday. luckily that wasn t the case. i really hope he can come to his senses and leave you alone and i just hope and pray that this is the last you ever have to interact with this person and that no danger ever comes your way
damn  that sucks. stay safe. god bless.
you re a strong woman melanie. you ll get through this. we got your back!
mel  sorry you have to go through this. keep your firearm clean and oiled. and your wits about you.stay safe kiddo.
i just watched one of those true crime documentaries about an uprising singer that had a stalker. met up with her at a meet and greet and didn t end well. people that are that infatuated with someone knows no bounds. hopefully melonie keeps people around and carries.
yep  that s why firearms are the greatest equalizer
@cayde-00  i believe you are referring to christina grimmie who was on the voice. yeah  there is a serious issue right now where people are paying the price for sudden fame  without the protection often put in place by celebrities through security firms.
@obsidian squared  yea she s the one. tragic what happened.
yikes  what a freakshow! good on you for uploading all the receipts. also  hope you take self defence lessions  and more indepth firearms training. if not  give a good think  and i can recommend active self protection here on youtube they are really great at highlighting dangers and how to avoid handle them.also...holy crap melonie  your 36  where is the fountain of youth located !
this whole video  my only thought is  i hope you have a lawyer and consulted them before this video .so  here s to hoping. remember folks  in this digital  social media run world  we put ourselves out there and truly trouble minds don t need a reason  they will make it up and convince themselves it is true.be safe. arm yourself and practice safety and train  train  train.
wow... what a total disaster! so sorry to hear you are going through this. hopefully the law will take care of this  but we all know that the law doesn t always seem to work that well in the interests of the innocent.... be careful!
sounds like that guy needs to get a life! sorry to hear about this! i ve dealt with people who lie and it sucks.it looks like he knows someone or is really good at lying too.
i wish you the best mel
stay safe!!!  stay vigilant!!
i say it is a good idea to lawyer up and i hope you stay safe melonie.  peace out.
if someone is stalking you  they deserve to have their life ruined
you also need to be careful with this stalker  he can be as crazy to stalk you outside of your home
had a stalker long ago. i had to tell her i was leaving the state due to grandparents dying. was the only way to get her to stop calling me and my roommates.praying this gets resolved quickly so you can just put it into your rear view. your content s awesome  sorry you have to deal with a stalker.
now it s well documented so that we can look on in disgust when he finally does harm some poor girl. hopefully he doesn t slip through the cracks. best to you miss.
no jokes. in this current crazy world we have to watch our own backs and always be the first one to shoot. best of luck and take care.
wow so he flipped it all around just to spend valentine s day with you in court! i guess that was his way of getting a date with you!but seriously i hope he seeks help because its getting bad real fast. may god bless you and protect you!
i would highly advise to go out and carry. train  train and train to be good at protecting yourself. a weapon is the great equalizer. even if you win the case. all it is is a piece of paper that says  don t go near her.  be safe and protect yourself family.
prayers this gets resolved.
good lordy!...be safe melonie. this is horrible
this tactic he used is very similar to the one amber turd used against johnny. he wasn t in the country so couldn t turn up to court and so the restraining order was set in place automatically. he basically tried to amber turd you.
so sorry you are having to deal with this you and all women who have to deal with this sort of thing unfortunately there are some people out there who have obvious mental issues..stay safe
situations like this are why i m glad i don t use mainstream social media  twitter  etc. .
man  this sicko is such a narcissist. he legit is just getting a kick of being the center of attention. he s doing it for an attention high. you got this! you will win this battle
im sorry u had to deal with that. yeah ive had a stalker myself. was an ex  she harrassed my entire family throughout my relationship with her  and even after i cut her off  my mother coupdnt stop recieving calls from.her trying to find me. it took freinds to finally get her to leave me alone.
@anthony m  oof. big time feels there. my stalker found our apartment land line   and started harassing my roommates to the point they were getting mad at me and it almost ruined our friendships. that s when i decided to take that route i did to get her to back of. i felt bad for her  but could not allow her toxicity to stay in my life.
so crazy. prayers for you and hoping this guy finally leaves you alone. so unfortunate how stuff like this happens. at the store i work at  there had been stalkers and weirdos that would follow and act creepy to the female associates. we 86 them from the store as soon as we find out about it. it s just weird what some guys get in their minds. hope it doesn t phase you with what you re doing on youtube. you have an awesome show and lots of support  not only with fans  but fellow youtubers. so keep up the good work and fighting the good fight!
i feel like keeping good company during these conventions is a must for people with large platforms. you just never know a person s intentions.
sorry you have to put up with people like hat i hope everything gets better and resolved and that guy doesn t take things to a big extreme.
honestly the most surprising thing to me in this whole video is that melonie is 36! i never would have guessed over 30
i m glad you re packing heat. keep it close at all times.
this situation is very much like the plot in some of the horror movies i have seen.
i just thank the good lord that he s been watching over all of this. it is really crazy. i ve been watching your channel for a little while now. not hearing about it for a while i genuinely forgot this was even a thing. long story short  i m sorry you ve had to deal with this and i know it ll be over soon. just keep hanging in there.
since court is now involved get you a good lawyer  save every single shred of documents  videos  posts   any evidence  everything.
i m sorry you gotta deal with this.  let s be real im sure plenty of us fans have a crush on you because you are attractive and personable but i trust nobody else watching your videos will stalk you.  seems like a very supportive fan base.  sometimes life just sucks and you gotta push through the tough times.  love your content and enjoy the videos on nerd culture!
very scary  what a creep! i m scared for you. make sure you have protection on you at all times. he sounds obsessed
am sorry this is happening to you. but keep up what you are doing and document everything that he is doing to you  take out a order of protection against him in your state and keep practicing with your firearm and stay aware of your surroundings and pack everywhere you go  legally of course . i fought a psycho stalker for 4 year who was stalking my girlfriend and wanted to try to kill me  but it is over now because he took his own life. i tell you this so you know you are not alone.
you need to be careful with people like him because he crazy and not in his right mind get security cameras and get a gun that way you can protect yourself from that crazy person. i had a stalker for years when i was younger and he came to my house trying to break down my door and windows but for some reasons the windows don t break and the cops get there in time  i had to move so he couldn t find me
i m putting an order in the courts of protection against you.here court are the dm s i kept sending her where i got no replies from her but kept trying to dm her. my brain already hurts lol.
this escalated more than i thought
be very careful. not taking this seriously enough could be dangerous. check your car for trackers  stay armed and keep your head on a swivel. some people didn t take it serious enough and either aren t with us or were seriously injured.
melonie  just let us know what help you need.
i know this sounds a bit much  but i would also advise getting a powerful door frame and door and always look into you re vehicle.  you probably already know these things  but i just want to help as much as i can from text.  as i said before i do wish you all the best in the world and will pray for you to have this stupid situation resolved.  i unfortunately have seen too much happen to women and i am full of so many emotions right now.  if my deteriorating memory can think of more i will post comments if i can.
dammit  you mean you re not making all these videos just for lil o me   jkhope this all gets resolved quickly! stay sane.
i m so sorry this keeps happing to you melonie. you re in my thoughts and prayers.
relieved to hear that the judge was rational.
right ! ! !
@roberto cortez  evidence  oh wait you don t have any
@henry gambles  where is melonie s evidence
@rusty shackleford  did you watch the damn video  she has the man s tweets!
@henry gambles  that s not evidence. evidence is when the perpetrator has blood on his her shirt. tweets are not evidence.
@melonie mac go boom  so he accused of you stalking him even though he s the one who drove up to find you  my head hurts from that one!
@rusty shackleford  tweets  dms  emails and other electronic communications are used as evidence all the time  einstein
i might not be much religious but i pray you get through this melonie. this guy is deranged and you don t deserve this! you are such a honest   amazing woman with your opinions and many care like me making my day!
he is creepy  praying for you
i am new here from the quartering. i do not know if there are red flag laws in your state but that would be a way that he could still disarm you. take care  be vigilant  and carry if you can legally.
you really have to be careful with these type of creeps because they wont stop at just say no.
this is an obvious extension of his ongoing harassment campaign. it is mind boggling that a judge even wasted time listening to it and i hope he gets jail time.
he is one of internet tough guys behind his keyboard  so above it all  but once he feels the littlest heat  he will go running out the door sobbing.
melonie  stay strong  and we will get you a big shovel for the pile of this guy s crazy.
this is so scary. got your back lady  whatever you need
the quartering is how i found out about this situation. may the lord bless you and keep you.
the man drove 15 hours just to gaze upon you. clearly his love is genuine . lol jk he s nuts
no worries the attacks always come in cycles.  prayers up for your strength and wisdom.  keep fighting the good fight!
wow  i thought you were 21!  congrats on getting a good judge though. stay safe and keep your guns close melonie!
dont get sucked into his insanity  gather as much proof and facts as possible and let that speaks for you. i wish you the best
my wife had a stalker before we met. he broke into her apartment when she wasn t home and stole all her underwear.
get private security! i m not talking about a min-wage guy  sleeping in his car in front of your house. there re several agencies that will protect you. contact other content creators  you trust   that have had this type of issue. he s too old to back down. also  no matter what happens legally  he will convince himself that someone is forcing you to reject him. take care and watch your 6.
wait ! you are 36!  holy crap you look 24!! 26 the most!! way to go!!!
keep everything he was doing on file and make a few different copies and send some hard copies to people you trust to keep in case.  sorry you gotta deal with this  but keep the trail up and if you can give a copy to someone close you trust too. always helps to keep extra copies of important stuff.  it s cool that you put this stuff up as well to let people know what s up.
that guy is nutter butters to the max.... happy the judge was not a moron and knew what was happening with all this. people like that need to be locked up. stay safe and keep putting out the great content
i hope you have a good security system and a firearm that you go to some legit classes with. luckily you live in texas. seriously though  there are some great companies out there for training and you ll learn a lot about just general awareness  home security  vehicle security  etc. a lot of them have a big youtube presence as well  i bet you could do some cool collaborations. this sort of thing might also make other guys think twice in the future. all great people who genuinely care about people s safety and have families of their own. a surprising amount of overlap with the gaming community as well.this is so weird.
sorry you re going through this. this dude needs to find another outlet for his weirdness!
i didn t realize melonie is 36. i assumed she was in her 20s. but it makes sense since she s so mature and chill. i m just one of her probably few female fans lol so i m not tryin to be creepy. just sayin she looks great for her age.
there is literally a beavis and butthead episode where they take a woman to court for being attractive and they called that harassment  and the judge was like   are you freaking kidding me
praying for you  you kinda have to give us daily updates now for our own peace of mind aha
its not unheard of for a stalker to sue someone for defamation.  your only defense is to record and save all messages that demonstrate an intension to harass you.
just be safe  young lady  you know all the things you have to do already. great job on the evidence  you ll need to keep collecting it  store copies of it somewhere else you trust. damn shame you have to go through this.
the implications he made with the oversized sweater comes off like self projection. he is obviously much older than you  to the point where he looks like he could be a parent of a person your age  yet he s actively trying to pursue you. it s creepy  gross  and says a lot about him.
i can see it know  g g content house where everyone is armed to protect melonie during her visit in hopes the weird guy shows up. on the other hand you are the one needing a restraining order.
one day you ll be able to look back and laugh about this  hopefully.
how are there people like this  like actually how  i really hope you win and they can lock this creep up  praying for you
i am 60 and any man that says your his future wife and drives that far to see you is an unhinged man. any decent man would never do that. i have had my share of men like this in my life and yes you have to deal with it the best way you can. always for awhile keep friends close and be cautious of your surroundings. since your local police know and you have evidence of his contacting you by video etc.  you did the right thing.
followed you alot on and off with different games  if we happen to be playing the same games. i ve never seen you once talk bad about anyone it s always about the games an casual talk.. hope this guy gets a life  like plenty of women out there an men like this spend their entire time stalking e girls
i m not sure you re in any real danger. it sounds like he s hurt because you rejected him  which was not only your right  but also the best thing to do.  he s lashing out  and it will probably go away. but just in case  stay safe. may god grant you safety and peace melanie mac
really hope and pray you get this matter dealt with. this guy seems nuts. i would say i hope you have a happy valentine s day  but that day has passed i think. also maybe you could buy a very mean dog with very sharp teeth just in case.
keep urself safe. keep ur home protection close to u. keep the evidence of his stalking  and keep ur freinds close. ill pray for u.
this entire situation gives me the creeps  stay save melonie. hopefully everything works out.
hold up melanie you re 36      i am calling bull on that!  honestly i thought you were probably like 25. i really can t believe that this guy is trying to screw you over like this. quite frankly if the court ignores the evidence that he himself incriminated himself with then that s a flawed system and i would fight a lot harder.
for what it s worth  that is a nice looking cardigan. stay safe out there! i would never leave the house without my edc.
melanie you should have gotten the injunction like most of us stated as soon as this happened.  nowadays hes probably gonna try to play the victim or state that you d had hurt his reputation  life  etc etc. an sue you........
be safe report him to tx police  and get a restraining order in your county. you may have to report him to his employer unfortunately.make sure you document everything on him--meaning keep a paper trail ..
you should record every time he talks to you just so you can use it in court. i think a lot of people need to use this shit more.stay safealso  shit this reminds me of a gunsmoke episode where a delusional guy  was after this pub owner called ms. kitty who s dating the sheriff  who s the protagonist   and straight up kidnapped her trying to force her to marry her. this is creepy shit.but still this is insanity he s clearly trying to get you disarmed so he can take advantage of you and try to take your right to bear arms.
omfg this guy is insane. i am so sorry melonie. please stay safe
stay safe  and keep within the law. you may want to consider an attorney to help guide you going forward. that way legally you cover your bases.
my gosh  this guy is insane. ok  you need to get a dog   trust me  a dog  will protect you. i fear this guy won t stop. i m praying  for you   i hope you ll be safe
stay strapped   if possible  keep a friend around when traveling till this goes away   stays away.
this is the type of staking that only escalates with police reports and responses.
i hope this creepy ass stalker should get justice and putting in jail for the rest of his life! i m sorry to hear  you have to deal with all of this serious situation going on. my thoughts and prayers for hopefully keeping you safe and strong melonie.
this is startling! insanity. praying for your safety and well-being. god bless.
i wonder if you could have him get a court-ordered mental-stability assessment  or whatever they re called  peace be with you.
first  sorry that you are dealing with this  a decent person should not have to deal with such things.  second as others on here have said  this person probably will not stop.  if he is going through such measures to try to get to you it does not seem likely to change.  i know that you have already got lots of advice like this but i would check with the local pd and see if they have anyone who can advise you on steps you can take.  there is also people like those at active self protection who can probably advise you on such matters.  a security consultant who specializes in public personalities could be a lot of help as well.  be safe  lots of your fans out here care about you.
take care and be safe melonie. dude s an absolute freak  maybe let your neighbors know so if they see him to call the police.
luckily for melanie she knows quite a few lawyers who can help with legal advice for free.99
this guy is creepy  be careful and stay safe.
that s a bold strategy cotton let s see if it pays off for him
an hour is wild  15 hours is something else.
since you live in tx  get a gun and make sure that if he comes uninvited in your home or wherever you happen to be  it ll be the last thing he does. stalking isn t cool and there s no reason to put up with it. these guys will take a restraining order against them the same way a bull takes a red cape. stay safe and remain vigilant!
please be careful melonie
i do not remember subscribing to you  it must have been a movie reaction or something.   sorry about what you re going thru.  after watching this vid it sure sounds like you have nothing to fear. do not leave the cave without your club.  stay armed. g-d protect you  you protect yourself as well.
wow melonie i never thought about a restraining order can take away your ability to be armed. that s crazy that we have law makers working against us.
where all here for you mel please be safe.
though some may disagree  most courts and judges ended up in their position by being reasonable. it s clear what is going on here and i think they will see that if they don t already. they do have to go through the motions though  but i think you ll end up on top of this situation in the end  hopefully in the short term.
i understood that reference  whahaha
this is hilarious in the  oh man...that s uh....yea...phewy...life is...something  kind of way
i ll say a prayer for you girl
be sure to sight the frivolous nature of this lawsuit so he can also enjoy the bill for any expense this stunt might ve cost you.
be very careful   love phase  first phase is of these kind of psychopaths is stalking the person  then try to talk the person  and if they can t achieve that  and the person that s being stalked stopped them by calling the cops or made it publicly  the psychopath starts the  hating phase   and that s really dangerous  so really watch your back  tell all your love ones where you are always  and put like on an iphone or similar  put your location on to your love ones  and make a restraint order if you haven t done that already.
of course he did as soon as you publicly exposed him i knew he d take it to court.
he literally just posted more stuff on his channel talking about getting someone else involved with this issue. he is also a truck driver because he is filming in his rig which is really creepy when you think about it.
love ya melonie... on your side!!!
hope you re ok.
yikes.  this is crazy.  i hope this all works out.  just make sure you keep your head on a swivel.  but if you need security hit me up.  this guy looks like he to try to use the system to force you to lower the ramparts so he can get easier access to you.  this is clearly someone unhinged and will not stop until he gets whatever he wants.  just be careful.  sorry this happening to you it is definitely a tough position to be in.  i have seen these things before and the system let s them down and i don t want to make it sound grime but normally with people like this it doesn t end until someone ends up in the ground and it is normally the victim.  just stay vigilant and do whatever you have to  to limit your time alone and do not travel in public solo and if you have too make sure you are large public places  not like that is a guarantee to stop someone but mitigate as much exposure alone.  keep us updated.
hi melonie i just subscribed to your channel i wish you the best of luck sorry you got to go through this because of a stalker who doesnt have a life but just be safe and be careful see you on the next live stream
man this is just rough to watch  guys  if you are watching people post stuff on youtube or social media  it is already stressful putting yourself out there. dealing with this is not very incentivizing for opening up. thank god mel is taking it all in stride  but dang  delusional people are all over the internet and need to chill. just enjoy the content and be well  beyond that  again...chill.
sorry this happening to you. just saw   via the quartering   that you set-up a  givesendgo  and gave my donation.  i hope you raise enough to cover your expenses and then some! stay strong  -  we re with you melonie!
when the court is involved  you don t talk to anyone about anything. i have 5 lawyers for different things  and they would all flip if i made a video about anything.
this happened to me only i got sued for defamation by my stalker and i am not even a streamer.
i wish you could just hire a big guy in a danky kang costume to throw barrels at the stalker from a distance.
i tried to get a restraining order against a crazy ex of mine and i got denied then she turned around and got one on me even through she was the one stalking and they gave it to her.... people are nutty man
girl stay safe  make sure this story ends safely and happily soon.
this would be a great episode on the podcast something was wrong
@melonie mac  if you haven t already  retain legal counsel you may be able to counter sue him in texas.  take his money and get a restraining order.
you got a creeper !! be careful girl!!! i pray your hearing stops this.
cause that s what they always do.
thank you so much! i ve been in touch with a lawyer who is helping me more tonight  this really means so much to me to have all this support
@melonie mac go boom  so happy to hear you are getting some legal help and god bless!
some men cannot take no as an answer  they think no means yes. men like this guy are a blight on us women.
she weaponizes her audience against me.  then leave her the hell alone.
glad you did the right thing the right way. it is great you got a good judge. stay safe.
this man understands irony. he s trying to  court  you...but seriously. i hope he leaves you alone.
i ll pray for you. luke s not gay and this guy will have what he deserves through the justice of men. take care.
he s trying to disarm you so he can approach your home. have a friend that also carries stay close by if that does happen.
i understand why melanie doesn t want us  her fans  to go after the guy.but she didn t say anything regarding if her fans want to volunteer to act as security body guards for her...i say at least two dozen should camp out around her house and keep an eye out for this guy.no way will he try anything when she has that many people around!
they need to get his desktop phone. bet he as some photos   videos on that thing with other woman also. the guy needs jail! should also sue him for loses for past 2 days also if you need help with lawyers open donate page up. we will help support you bring him down to justice
you got served a notice to appear in court valentine s day from your stalker. that s irony for ya.on the serious side  get yourself a good lawyer because if he s successful in somehow getting the restraining order on you  your ability to defend yourself will be kneecapped and helpless is just how he wants you. stay safe and let s hope and pray this ends well for melonie.
everyone else giving good advice so i ll just say this  if you have the money melonie you might want to look into hiring a personal security firm and have a bodyguard assigned to you until this blows over. it s expensive but worth it considering what that freak is trying to do.
you re in texas  keep a hand cannon ready. he brakes in. melonie really go boom.
i dealt with people like this in the past and the best way to go about it is just block  live life and keep that thing around just incase.
that guy has some serious issues. even in today s clown world i feel like the court will be in your favor.
we should get this guy arrested no matter what. your safety is more important.
holy shit  surely the court will just look at the two of them and know who s stalking who.also mel is 36  i thought she was early 20s.
hopefully you won t be disarmed melonie  if you already haven t get your self a rottweiler or two
we need to call any open asylum in florida and tell them one of their patient s have escaped
imagine stalking your crush  i can barely be bothered to text back
hopefully he continues to defend himself without legal counsel. that way he can incriminate himself more in front of the court and they throw the book at him!
how can he claim you re stalking him when he shows that he initiated all the conversations though.
one state cannot disarm you in another one
@michael brown  exactly! keep that in mind!
a 12 gauge and 00 buckshot will do the trick for home defence. don t have to worry about ricochets or stray bullets passing through walls.
so did i and i m 22
i was shocked to find out she was 36  i thought it was a mistake and had to look it up. she ain t just a pretty face though  she s got a good head on her shoulders  love her vids.
what does age have do with it  stalking is stalking  no matter what age you are. what makes being in your 20s any different when your stalked!
@mailtaz  you clearly missed the point.
@mailtaz  nothing in regards to stalking  just trying to say she looks damn good without being rude or creepy.
ok  i ve listened to the end. don t let him disarm you!  i hope this stops soon and the law just lets these requests from him lay low.  was up at 5am walking  pacing and praying for you  will rest easier tonight.  i ll change today to go bloom since i don t want any negative connotations.
jesus  the world is full of weirdos  keepsafe melonie!
if you need help with security  i m sure my fellow veterans and myself will be more than happy to provide firewatch.
i m a dude and i had a guy stalk my net accounts after blocking him he was a friend though before i blocked him. he hasn t stopped for almost 3 years now. it s very annoying. i wanted that guy to leave me alone too. so i locked my accounts and deleted my streaming account ect. worth it for my sanity lol... but i know with as many followers as you have that s not possible so hope things get resolved for you soon.
do you know what the source of this guy s problem is  few  possibly nobody  has ever said no. he s used to having his way or  at the very least  getting away with it. while this is a difficult period for you  mel  here s one positive you can take away you re saying no. for this reason  you may actually bring about the change that actually fixes this man or stops him completely. don t relent. we re here.
hell  even if you said not interested i would have walked away. however  i would never think what this looney toones is doing. i m sorry that you have to go through this.
every time i think this guy is done and it s over he comes back he needs to take a hint.
stay strong like classic lara would melonie!!! we all got your back and you will get through this!hopefully they will see how crazy this is and make sure that he won t get it his way..
he just thinks you re playing  hard to get
you re 36 ! you look like you re 20! what s your secret  i must know. ps hope this whole situation goes away.
this is a power trip for him. you told hom to cease all contact with you or you would file charges. this put you on top and he just saw it as a challenge to his sick  authority . his solution was then to abuse the legal process so he can feel in control of you again. i don t believe you are his first victim. netflix has a couple documentary shows on scammers and those made me think like them  this is his life s pattern. he has likely done this before.i think you should do two things 1  get a private investigator to see if he has done this before so you know what is coming next. he likely knows other legal loopholes to use against you so he can keep his contract desires fed.2  with that  ask your lawyer or a lawyer better about to know about this what his next steps likely will be.i don t think its over by far even if you win this fight. he will see it as a loss of control and do something else  likely legally.
21 11 poor thing! hang in there melonie!
so sorry you have to go through all this. the good people in this world sadly always seem to. stay strong stay safe all  of us will be praying for you .
you should hire some ex mob enforcers to be your bodygaurd
basically melonie mac is like eve and the stalker is like the serpent from the bible
i m sorry for all this crap you are going through  eat some butter  be awesome  yeah  no one deserves this.
just keep your gun close and your  eyes wide open. this sounds like he is capable of waiting for you in a van or something.....be careful!
praying for you
dude skipped the wedding and went straight to divorce court.
first and foremost mel  get an attorney experienced in defense against protection orders. your rights are on the line don t think you can simply reason with the legal system. i can t stress this enough!secondly  be aware of nut jobs trying to take you down. you ever watch basketball and see a player draw a foul or aka flop...these crazy people out here will stop at nothing to silence voices they don t like.last bit of advice from me today ...hit the range more and get surgical with it. when seconds count police are minutes away.
why are you talking about   haha
thank you so much  god bless you
@robertocortez9904  yes.
@roberto cortez  i wouldn t view liars as being good people!
@henry gambles  who s lying
the world is crazy and after seeing this  i will make sure my daughter knows this fact.
imagine being so desperate for attention that you stalk someone and then take them to court for stalking when they don t give in to you..  i m sorry this is happening to you. if you ever need security for events in the cleveland akron area i know people that can help  including myself.
honestly even if you did somehow get disarmed  i would still keep a piece in the house whether you have to borrow one or hide one somewhere  even if you get in trouble for having it that s better than being attacked and having to go hand to hand with someone. regardless praying you come out on top of this  that s really scary
so did he admit to being a diddler since he was attracted to you  as per his defense.quite the projection on his part lmao
is he trying to put himself in prison
lord  please be with melonie. keep your hand on her  and surround her with your peace. please deliver her from all this lunacy. we ask in jesus name. amen.
this is messed up i hope this guy frakks off. keep praying.i used to follow a mexican actress named gaby who was part of an ensemble cast for a really fun show named acabatelo  andi dont remember what her status update was but i replied  then i got an imediate reply from this guy saying that she was his girlfriend  and i noticed he was replying to a lot of users back. she hadnt revealed any relationship stuff  infact she said she wanted to be alone for a while and her co host would often poke fun at her many bad relationships. creeps sadly   if not stopped or given a stern warning will continue to feed on the delusion  when it s as overt as this mess  it s indeed cause for corncern specialy if the person is unhinged. may the lord rebuke him and keep people lie that away. or brng gino  venti and jay to be bpdyguards xd
stay safe melonie
now imagine if red flag laws were passed  allowing such creeps to more easily ensure that potential victims are defenseless.
i swear every women has been through this at least once .
jeremy from the quartering needs to get you in touch with internet famous half asian lawyer bill richmond and make sure you are protected legally from this.
our court systems give more rights to criminals then citizens. it s been broken for many years and it isn t getting fixed any time soon. i feel it s constantly getting worse.
weaponizing her audience against me   you did that to yourself buddy - maybe you shouldn t have been a creepy stalker thinking a woman you barely know irl is going to be your wife.
stalkers need to be punished. criminals need to have consequences for their actions that harm others
i m glad the judge is seeing through his blather.
bro needs to be in a padded jail. i ll keep praying for you melanie.
we love you melonie and we got your back
he s insane.  don t try to make sense where there is none.stay safe.  if you can get a restraining order on him.  never hope things like that just go away.
i bet some yt attorneys would love to help.
stay strong and remember to breathe.
restraining orders won t help  she better be able to protect herself when he inevitably loses it
people today are so thin skinned. in my time a girl said she didn t want to deal with you  you shrugged and went away. today s  feelings  guys can t take rejection ... suck it up butter cup  walk away. melonie stay safe  always keep aware  keep your safety routine at home up. don t slack up on it.
the guy can t can t accept rejection   goes to this extreme .  i ve been through rejection   it does suck but damn  he needs to move on because he just madehimself look even more stupid then he already is. maybe the only good to come of this is everyone will know how unhinged   creepy he is   avoid him. hopefully this gets settled soon. also you re 36  i thought you were at least in your late 20 s at best.
melonie  just know... if you need prayer for anything ... anything at all... never hesitate to ask us. we re more than here for you and want to support you in what ways we can.
it took 2 years just for me to get a restraining order on my ex  and another 6 months for her to piss off a judge and lock her up for contempt before she finally went away.
i can tell you re worked up about it. just calm down. you ve done everything you need to do. his legal actions are obviously frivolous and will be laughed out of court. just do what you need to do and then ignore him. prayers for you.
this bloke is obviously highly dangerous !!!  keep doing whatever you need to do to keep yourself safe from this absolute nutcase !!!  ... stay strapped and alert ! and don t hesitate ! if it comes to the crunch ...
10 54 you have nothing to worry about  god is on your side. there s no problem not to heavy  or light for him.and he ll continue to have his angel s on the ready  to protect his sheep. keep doing good melonie. pray up
i hope you okayed these types of videos with your lawyer
i ve seen true crime stories start like this  obsessed nutjobs  stay safe!!
these people can and often do become very dangerous  very fast. lawyer up  keep the police apprised at all times. consider filing a restraining order.
edit - no one interact with the reply to this message below pretending to be from melonie  it is  as i m sure almost everyone is aware  not from her   a trap.take care  melonie. thank goodness the judge was on the ball!given you have all the evidence   he has none it s hard to see how his latest scheme could go anywhere.
narcissists are like this .. get a way to defend yourself with.. your discretion.. stalkers are as you said are unpredictable.  be safe
the judge said why it was not dismissed before it got to this point. the material supporting the charge was not challenged in the motion to dismiss that was filed with the judge or the judge would have reviewed it already.
these is not right noo one should have to ever deal with a stalker. am glad your safe
for people like him that it doesn t matter what you wear or what you say or what you do it s that they ll think negative of you and try to paint everything as if that they are in every right in what they do  if you weren t a political channel he d probably have an issue with it saying  you need to come out become one so long as it s on my side  if you wore just plain clothes  you need to be more seductive looking  or  you need to appeal to kids more
the judge knows what s up  and so do the cops. be careful if you go to the geeks and gamers house because he will probably show up to taunt you in a place where he knows those guys will defend you.
as a general rule stalkers are relentless and hell bent. they aren t rational people so reasonable things don t work with them. about the only thing that works is when they get put away.
- your honor  my proof of harassment is people telling me to stop harassing.wait  what... - ...what
this is probably a very old trick in the book for stalkers that authorities the court system are familiar with. if this guy was crazy enough to do it  it has definitely happened before. it is very clear you are not in the wrong here and the judge seemed to recognize that immediately. he probably shot himself in the foot with this whole situation.
please be safe. best wishes and god bless
it wouldn t matter what you said or did or dressed like he probably would still have an issue  people these days can  and will make a stink over stuff just because they can
i mean  i think you are very beautiful and attractive but him doing a lot of what he was been doing definitely gives off major creeper vibes.
melonie i hope you win the fight
good lord! glad you re taking this creep seriously. stay safe!
this guy sounds like a special kind of something no judge worth their salt would believe anything he has to say
don t worry. we got you.
sadly the courts and justice system don t do anything to keep these loonies locked up and allow them to get worse and do harmful and deadly things. you ll basically have to have private security when you go to events from no on and livestream your outings so he can t do anything. sad but that s king of how it will be since the freak won t leave you be. and luckily you re in texas so you can have better help.
i have no idea who you are until now  and even if you were secretly a con artist or whatever he was saying.. hes basically saying  i am harassing this person because they are harassing me  wtf.i hope you will be ok! this is awful  what a creepy guy!
wot kind of warped reality are we in where taking someone to court for stalking them makes perfect sense
stay safe melonie! this guy is a total creep.
use the needler for self-defence. but seriously stay safe.
it d be a real shame if somebody stalked him and he suddenly had an accident. and disappeared. forever. what.
wow this guy is a total nutcase. it s pretty scary to be honest. praying for your continued safety  mel.
all the judge had to do was look at him and then look at you .then it would be obvious whos the stalker
i would certainly love to be able to give this guy a good  talking to. it worked for my daughter s stalker. he certainly doesn t bother her anymore  and i wish i could do the same for melonie.
that s really twisted.  i hope the justice system actually works for once and this guy is kept far away.  no one should have to deal with unhinged crazy people fixating on them.
this is what stalkers do they flip it to where their the victim and their victim is stalking them. sadly in a lot of court cases the stalker usually wins. hopefully this judge has enough common sense to see through this man s lies.
care and support from across the pond
this guy glows  like bright green.
ugh. just saw this on the quartering...sorry to see that you are dealing with this. my best.
sorry to see you go through this. hopefully this gets resolved quickly.
you need a good old 1911 just in case  he looks like that kind of guy to come back to your location.
there is no fight here. she has a clear case lol.
if she s in tx  i hope to god she carries  and goes to the range often  that s one way to end stalking really quick.
one thing i see about this dude is that he had a serious crush on u and unfortunately he deluded himself into believing that you ll be his wife someday which didn t come to pass  now his in denial and just flat out desperate and his being creepy about it my advice to you is that u should file a restraining order against him you have more than enough evidence to keep him far away from u and always be strapped on.
that s how they work. the process is the punishment.
i had to get a protective order against a psycho ex-gf. hang in there  melonie. this crap is no fun. you ve documented everything and have video proof. get a solid lawyer and any judge will throw this crap out  then you can get a protective order against him.
it troubles me to see you upset. i thought this was over with. glad the case went in your favor and hopefully the appeal will go nowhere. stay alert.
this is why it s always important to be strapped.
this guy legit sound like a total nut case. i hope you stay safe.
continue to go to the firing range  get extra extra security. get a guard dog. learn some martial arts. maybe have a friend stay with you for a while. it will help you get some ease of mind while you have to wait for justice to hopefully do its course.
it seems he s going through bids of psychosis
a few takeaways 1  this guy is demented and i hope he gets the help he needs  whether that s therapy or some jail time to be alone with his thoughts.... ...a forcibly arranged face to face with god...  you know whatever help would best benefit him.2  don t go after this guy...  understood ...jk! 3  you re 36!! wow! i had you figured for younger than that! you keep doing whatever you re doing.4 also   dotdotdot  is called an ellipsis.
your doing the right thing and im sorry your going through this its disgusting   im glad the judge laughed at that creep
he is such a great future husband.....by giving her court papers on valentines day.
he complained about you blocking him shows that he s the stalker not you.all the judge has todo is watch your clips and they ll see he is the crazy one.also the fact he drove 15hrs to find you is more proof that he is chasing you  and the more account he makes that you block shows he won t take no for an answer and you need a restraining order on him.
don t know if you might read this  but this is legitimately dangerous.  a lot of red flags in that profile.  you present as young and vulnerable  and it s likely he won t go anywhere without finding another target.  i wish there was more i could say  but apply the common sense safety protocols   let neighbors know to keep an eye out for anything unusual  set your alarm  have people you trust in the loop  preferably close and vigilant .  trust your instinct  if something feels off  err on the side of caution  get help  do not put yourself anywhere he might have advantage .  unstable people don t tend to self-correct  and if this is what it looks like  he s not going to be deterred by anything that would be meaningful to a semi-rational person.
i don t know anything about you or your channel  i heard about this from the quartering. that said  i pray that god deals with that weirdo. stay safe  ma am.
can they disarm your parents  relatives or friends if they pass the order on you
roses are redviolets are blueyou won t love meso i m gonna sue wtf is wrong with stalkers  well  i guess they re not right in the head pretty much by definition
sorry you have to deal with this! so glad that judge was level-headed about it. we support you!
this really is a classic tactic that people like this use.  it s so common that there s even a term for it - darvo.  deny  attack  and reverse victim and offender
razorfist slid in your dm s on valentines day  should have asked him to come over with his mauser revolver and his dog  cicero!
the fact he could not afford a plane ticket is a red flag
well  some people are allergic to flowers.
this is infuriating to hear melonie. the justice system is broken. criminals use it to victimize victims instead of being a system to protect people from lunatics like this guy. stay safe mel.
you re absolutely asking for him to be doxxed. i don t blame you  maybe another one of your stalkers will handle it. i hope you have protection.
u are not asking us to do anything! but we will pray for ur well-being  mac..
so when his privacy is being infringed he s upset  but not when he s infringing on someone else s privacy or rights. classic.
damn. don t underestimate crazy. carry something wherever you go and make sure your iron is at hand.
please carry seriously don t depend on the courts to protect you.
dude s completely deranged. the fact that he sued you for stalking is complete clown shoes. this guy has some cognitive dissonance. stay safe  melonie.
malone mac boom your a gift from god to your beautiful family  god bless you forever sweetheart
narcissist activity. be careful melonie
melonie  nooooooooo  you cannot steal jay from us. you must be stopped!!!! this is madness!!!!!
prayers!
if you have his address and legal name  you can look up his record online... arrest reports and the outcome of the trials are public record. may be a good idea to check that out  eh  might make you feel better if nothing major comes back while youre waiting for the restraining order to be granted... and if something does come back  make those charges and the concers they bring known to the authorities and judge regarding his previous offenses  if he has any... and something tells me i wouldn t be shocked if he did. it can potentially expedite the process if he s been a violent offender of any kind  he s  clearly shown he won t hesitate to drive 15 hours  or go to a place where it s been publicly mentioned you re going to be for work  but then more than likely  never goes to anything similar if you aren t going to be there. not even if it s close to him  but then he ll drive  i m assuming  long distance just for your event  in my mind  that s also evidence.. on its own it d be circumstantial  but with potential criminal background  you really should check   all the messages  comments  and everything else he s done and said after you ve told him to stop  blocked him  and then drove 15 hours one way  that could and should add a lot to your evidence and help paint a picture.stay vigilant when it comes to him  but don t worry about having this turned around on you or losing your right to arm yourself.. there s zero evidence towards you  you ve got all the proof  and he s the one shown a willingness to cross multiple states. there s no way a judge would do that to you  if they did  then that s quite possibly an infringement on your 1st amendment rights  which wouldn t look good for them if he became public. but more than anything  they won t take a chance of endangering a women with a clearly delusional mentally ill manjust the fact he drove for 15 hours and sat there without any realizations or self reflection regarding this whole thing he s brought about and didn t once think   hmmmm  what am i doing with my existence  can t really call it a life   maybe i shouldn t be doing this    that s really bad.. in my opinion  he s shown narcissistic and even borderline  psychopathic tendencies.
personally i would give all your evidence to the courts only and not to a potential 121 thousand total strangers online because i can nearly guarantee in that number this guy isn t the only nut among them.  just my two cents
geeze  guy reminds me of my ex wife.  manipulative gas lighter that tries to use the system as a weapon against you.glad things are going sorta okay.  hope this eventually goes away on some level.
the more melonie says shes 36  the less i believe her. hmmmmm she looks 10 years younger
this is just sad. unfortunately if you re an attractive woman  this is one of the potential things you have to deal with. honestly i ll never be able to understand how or why someone would want to be with someone who clearly doesn t want anything to do with them. seriously  there are so many things you could do in life  that don t involve devoting any of your time to someone who wants nothing to do with you. guys like this actually give every normal guy a bad name. there are women who will see this horror story  and will actually end up being afraid of regular guys because of this sick nut. i mean shoot your shit  if she s not interested which 99.99  of women with fame or public personas will fall under  move on. find a woman who s actually interested and be happy.
get yourself a good camera system around your place if it s an apartment get a curved lense door camera with a screen on the door. set up a panic button on your phone with the external buttons so you don t even have to turn the screen on and look at it to call the cops. and stay strapped as much as you can. go to the range and get very comfortable with drawing when close to a target and getting lead down range. remember a restraining order is only a piece of paper when it counts. cops take time to get there.
keep fight and be safe
talk to rekietalaw and thequartering about crowdfunding for any lawsuit you might have to make against this insane stalker.
6 46  me looking at myself in the mirror in shame as i hear this part lol.
age doesn t always equate to looks. i m 34 but people assume i m my son s sister.
yeah she doesn t look like she s in her 30 s!
take care and stalker leave her alone!
this has to be nerve racking af
i think sean s actual future wife is in cell block b enjoying his taxpayer funded room   board.
that is some creep shit  for real.  be safe out there
announce a public meet and greet with armed friends mixed into the crowd. counter ambush tactics.
what the hell  i m sorry you have to deal with this
i m sure there is a lot of us who would be more than happy to meet this guy face to face.
melonie mac is 36 years old ! i honestly never in a million years would have guessed that lol i just assumed she was like 25
fingers crossed   maybe he ll do like bjorks biggest fan.
carry  stay at a goods friend house  maybe even your parents house for a little bit. if you have a brother stay with them.
as i have not dived into both sides of this story  i cannot assess the situation properly. that being said  stalkers in general seek attention period. it does not matter if it s good or bad attention  it s attention that feeds their delusions of love intimacy with their victim.in the mind of a stalker  if their victim files restraining orders  vids online asking them to stop  etc etc. it s nothing but their victim playing coy and fortified their delusions of intimacy. the best course of action is file a tro  temporary restraining order  illustrating you have a fear for your life and safety. add security cameras to your property connected to a dvr. in instances where stalkers file tro s against the victim they tend to be the extreme. in many cases they end up attempting to assault kill their victims after the realization of rejection kicks in. which normally does not occur until face to face contact occurs and they attempt physical contact and the victim recoils in disgust.everytime you respond to a stalkers comments  emails  videos they post  etc. it only feeds their delusions. on the flipside  when you ignore them in some cases it can enrage them and fuel their anger aggression and even speed up any potential confrontation.the best course of action is employ security when your in public  keep records of any attempted contact  have security cameras at your home and carry a means of self defense.the legal standard for shooting a stalker or anyone intent to do you harm is the following.if you spot them call 911 immediately when possible  stay on the line with the operator when possible.when engaged with your aggressor  continue to move away while keeping your gun pointed at them. loudly announce  i have a gun and i will shoot   two verbal announcements is the minimum in most cases. continue to move backwards from your aggressor while maintaining sight in them. if they continue to come at you  discharge a round as a warning  repeat  i will shoot you  and if he continues shoot them. states have varying requirements and of course all incidents will be evaluated by law enforcement to determine if reasonable self defense occured. as long as you follow the formula provided  the federal standard  you cannot be criminally charged if you have the legal right to own a fire arm.giving this information in no way is me advocating to harm someone  it simply is me recognizing the dangers presented by stalkers and assisting those who are victims in knowing how to defend themselves within the guidelines of the law.i have my phd in psychology and specialize in sex offenders rehabilitation and treatment as well as forensic interviewing with child sex crime victims.one should always contact local law enforcement to find out the state requirements of self defense whenever one is in fear for their life and safety.as i have not investigated your situation i cannot assess it  i cannot determine the threat factor here  if any  nor am i confirming that the party in question fits the psychological standard of stalker. i m simply providing. a generalized description of potential harm by those who stalk and giving the appropriate course of actions i recommend one to take.as a full supporter of the 2nd amendment and one who supports the safety of women i will leave you all with this little nugget of truth.no woman armed with a gun has been raped while being armed with a gun. gun ownership is the  1 preventive measure against rape.a gun is an equalizer in any scenario where a woman could be harmed. supporting gun rights supports women s rights.
if this guy lives in florida and is stalking you. all you need to do is contact the police department where this guy lives in florida. i have lived in florida my whole life and i know of no state that has stricter stalking laws than florida. minimum sentence is 5 years in prison. they do not play with stalkers in florida and he would serve 80 percent of that sentence no matter what. they dnt release people here after they serve 5 per emt of their sentence. if you have the prove that he has been stalking you it s real easy to handle that here
i hope he gives up and leaves you alone now  though i can t believe he will after all of this. you don t deserve this crap. i m glad you re still safe. hope the rest of your day is amazing   melonie.
if someone does go after him he could point to his video as evidence you encouraged it.  you need to get better advice because you re current advisors are not necessarily doing you any favors.  an attorney is also needed but they aren t around most of the time.
not exactly a walking sim  is it  in any case you are doing the right thing.
served papers on valentines day from a stalker....can t make that shit up lol
it s almost an occupational hazard if you re a big you tuber if its not trolls its stalkers this guy has proven he s no potential husband to you melonie he s a driven man vindictive and calculating and who knows what he d do to you had you met him then what if you  offended  him or he perceived you to have done something wrong he needs help what a waste of his time and yours that he can t just move on or find true love the normal way rather than this twisted obsession.
if he left a card on your car....he probably has your license plate number now.be careful.
edited not legal advice request  motion  for a process of discovery.if you do this  you  might  be able to recover data from his deleted accounts.also research as many cases local to him  if he lives in another state  as you can and research cases  local to you. also research federal cases as well. reference these cases in your favor to help explain your situation and create a defense based on prior  precedent  judgements.get a lawyer as well.
this is a typical power play. you fought against him and he may continue further litigation. in my career  i have seen or heard stories of perpetrators file up to 400 court motions in a year.
@blox117  or a person could just be concerned that an innocent woman is being griefed. you know. whatever.
let s hope she has some friends who can give him a permanent tune up.
that carnivore diet works wonders.
and i ve been really considering getting on the carnivore diet. my brother is a believer and practitioner himself  and here in jordan peterson list all the positives that he s gotten from it is also a very intriguing and now the fact that it s probably contributed to melonie mac s youthful energy i am definitely going to have to give it a try.
it might be worth your time to invest in a home security system  if you don t already have one.  it s a shame that it s come to this  but people harass online personalities with alarming frequency.
i haven t realized that there are weapon acquiring benefits for watching this channel
as someone who has tripped mad balls and been delusional... this man is clearly 100  delusional. stay safe  man.
twist... she s really stalking him
i hope you immediately applied for  retraining order on this guy.
you should reach out to office of the governor of florida where the nut is to see if they can help you out
i mean  i m 40 and still wear tmnt shirts and things that i loved from my childhood from time to time.  doesn t mean i m trying to draw in that priest attention.
sorry you ve had to deal with this. absolutely nuts.
should probably avoid mentioning what state you live in. this kind of situation is exactly why making restraining orders easier to get is a bad thing  just becomes another tool for abusive people to use to harass their intended victims. if this guy doesn t relent you should look at having a friend or family member stay with you
please stay safe!!!
that dude s crazy
don t worry melonie if you come to florida i got your back
if you tried to weaponize us  he d know.  i believe you are capable of defending yourself here  but if that changes  i hope you d let us know.
no one needs or should go through this holy shit can hope he gets major jail wtf
get an injunction which is more powerful than a restraining order. it prevents him from getting a gun and it will show on his record and people he knows can t contact you no he can t contact you in anyway and the injunction can become indefinite or permanent and if he violates it he s screwed and goes to prison plus the distance he has to stay away is even farther than a restraining order ect.
higher a cheap lawyer from that area and sue him for court fees  put a hole in his pocket.
he picked the wrong woman to mess with. we ve all got your back!
you should not post his account name or his images videos because you re just giving him another reason to sue you for defamation. whether or not he wins  the point is he s using the courts to force you to see him. stay safe.
i ve been trying for months now
@melonie mac go boom  through a lawyer  i m hoping. a temp order can be issued by a judge  ex parte  under stalking rules. i am amazed this at least was not granted  especially in texas. i am very sorry people have to go through this.
as someone who s born and raised in florida all u had to say was he s from florida and it all made sense.
@ melonie i only came by this video because of me commenting on one of your other videos  more to the point i made arguing against your opinion on the other video  this stalker is a man who born a man and isn t normal to be doing something like this i hope you stay safe and well.
you re not helping her case by saying this
@the mighty crixus  i m not advocating violence. i m talking about support her
@sever 7  im not the one you she will have to convince. she already said the guy is saying her audience has been weaponized. this reads as a veiled threat.
@the mighty crixus  he s not well in the head though trying to convince him is a lost cause!
@henry gambles  the person who will need convincing is the official presiding over the case
i highly recommend getting a restraining order. not that it will stop him or anything but it gives you leverage with law enforcement. if he chooses to violate the order then he can be arrested and prosecuted. yes it sucks  its a pain  and it costs money but i highly recommend it at this point.
get a restraining order if you feel tm threatened in any way.
insanity. this stalker is dangerous. be careful . we can only hope his employer    his  local cops are aware.
this is horrific. thank god you did the right thing and went to the cops. this person needs to be treated.
melonie  blocking and distancing herself from this dude  in this guy s mind logic is somehow melonie stalking him     yup the clown soundfx is appropriate
positive or negative attention it doesnt matter to these people. dont make any more videos on it. settle it privately. dont announce your travel public. he ll move on if he finds he cant manipulate you.
talk to rekieta if you haven t  and he might be able to reco a good texas lawyer.
omg i can t believe he actually did this bruh...  he should be locked up immediately into a insane crazy asylum...
the crap that female youtubers have to put up with is unbelievable. i am praying for you  i hope this all blows over.
back in the good old days the police would of picked this creep up drove him out to the middle of nowhere and  explained to him  why his behavior was not appropriate. before people yell police brutality this was before stalking  domestic violence laws and protection orders weren t a thing.
can you get a compound bow without registration  just in case. one good shot will stop anyone in their tracks.
i m sorry you re having to deal with this. hang in there.
there is a percentage of not-smart people in every society. it s your choice whether to spend time and resources on them. and don t be upset because he takes you to court because that only means you will reveal the truth and he will be forced to admit his ridiculous actions.do not do what is hated to you  to others. melonie  you are 100  right and it s just a shame he is using you to get popular. do not let any of those like him to affect who you are  can t let them have that sort of a win. be as you are  don t change and even though i m new  i m sure most fans don t want to see you change because of them. they love you because you are melonie mac.
this is scary af stay safe
he s taking the term  trying too hard  to a whole other level
mac you should start a clock.what i mean by that is you get your parents or someone close. and you tell them call you to hear your voice every 12 to 24hrs. if you miss a check in. the police are called.
do not talk more about this case in public! it could hurt you later down the line in court. hire a good lawyer and go to the firing range and practice. get yourself a concealed carry license.
be safe!
i am reminded of what john spartan says in demolition man.  send a maniac to catch a maniac.
okay  two questions...1  on what grounds does this dude actually have a case 2  what lawyer was smoothbrained enough to take it
thank you so much
good idea
hire  your armed fans friends as bodygaurds.
just remember to keep your friends close.sig sauersmith   wessonheckler   kochcoltglockbenelli
damn didn t want to date him and he took you to court lmaooooo gonna get that back pay for love
the judge  should have requested he under go a mental  health  evaluation on the  spot notify  your local  prosecuting attorney s  office  and  police department  of the situation  so if he  tries to  disarming you  they will  understand the  situation and it won t  effect  your  right to  carry it sucks  your the going  through  this bs.
two words  conceal carry. i m sure you know that already.
contact the state bar of texas and ask for a recommendation for an attorney.
red flag laws hurt more than they help. you shouldn t give up your weapon. someone can lone you one if they take it.
if he has no proof of you stalking him  which he doesn t cause i know you. then he can t get a restraining order and therefore can not disarm you.... and if he gets one on you... well... he can t disarm me....
stalkers are delusional and psychotic and can be very dangerous. please take this seriously and protect yourself.  i can t believe a judge would even entertain this  but you should counter-sue this pos and get a restraining order.
melonie is 36    damn i thought she was like 20 or something
melonie  crazy people often try to turn things around and manipulate the situation using the courts or cops or whatever to make themselves look like the victim of the same crap that they are trying to pull.  i am sorry to see that you are having to go through this with this jerk.
16 14the guys deluded  no way you could shack up with jay even if you wanted too.you d have to fight gina for him  and as capable as i think you are  i don t think you d best the g-train in the octagon.
getting served on valentines day is crazy lool
i m no lawyer  but my common sense tells me that since the problem is going legal  you should stop providing information about the situation on public media  and get a lawyer.also  no matter if he deleted the accounts  the beauty  or ugly  of the internet is that everything is recorded.  a court order to twitter can bring back log info about those accounts  and any information associated with them  and from that  the ip can be traced to the company he used for internet service.again keep publishing videos to let people know you are safe  but keep this incident private.  stay safe.
i ll pray for you! this guy needs a jail cell.
stalking seems so exhausting. i don t understand why anyone does it. doesn t this guy have anything else going on in his life  a job  a family  bills  this is nuts.
that guy is a total narcissist instead of recognizing his inappropriate behavior and stopping he s creating the story in his mind where you are the bad guy that caused this whole situation now he s playing the victim wow
what a creep...good thing you collected some evidence.still can t believe he would take you to court.i actually feel a less creepy now watching a gamer girl knowing you re also 36 lol
you need to do a video on what caliber handgun you carry everywhere you go and how dead-eye accurate you are behind the trigger...
protect yourself by any means . fund your protection . god bless .
dude needs help.i dreamed about hanging out with boggie2998 and playing old fighting games like mk.i dreamed a similair dream with melonie in it  we played tomb raider and talked about the bible and crazy leftist.but when i wake up i relize it s just a dream  this guy seems to stay in a fantasy dream world.yes i have some wild dreams  sometimes if i spend a few days playing a video game or watching a movie series i dream about it.
i arrived here via the quartering. good dude  btw. it was smart to make everyone aware of this creeper. stay safe. stay strapped. florida  though. amirite
where s the man in your life to curb this bullshit single
you need ubisoft to get you some splinter cell game info stat!
breaks my heart actually. society inwhich we are expected to fight and die to defend this and equate them as normal or victims of oppression. its so bad even just recent 10- 15 years ago. omg i true hate these people. beyond redemption. nobody cares for their true colours till too late
i don t know much about criminal profiling or psychopathy but it s possible the less control he feels the more desperate he gets. maybe reach out to those in the mental health community on advice for moving forward about public comments on the situation or court cases.you seemed to indicate he was having life-affecting delusions on things you weren t even saying or had nothing to do with him  so i assume directly addressing him and the case might increase level of delusion. i have no idea.i understand you are exposing him for your own protection but also encouraging you to get counsel in this area too.all the best
i am praying for you. you know  taking god s name in vain actually means  saying god told me when in fact  he did not!. i am also praying for this guy. we always revert to hate  when in fact  we have done terrible things ourselves. i hope this guy finds the truth. it will set him m free.
wait what  36  no way  you don t look anywhere near that.  also the hair is super duper cute today... love it!
this guy needs to move on and this would all go away. but  his pride is keeping him going.
i am so truly sorry. i cant understand people like that.
why doesn t the court just restrain him from contacting you or getting near you
its amazing how someone can just do this and it takes until something basically physical to happen before law can be involved. what a joke.
this is so fucked up. this guy has killer written all over him. please stay safe
florida  even most of pur trial judges are pretty darn good.
happy late valentines day  sorry you had to deal with a messed up dude.
yeesh. what a mess. sorry  mel. the worst part about all of this is you didn t get to stream hogwarts legacy. it s fun af. i can t stop playing it. go boom
pretty sure you re no con artist. hopefully the court has common sense about this.
the legal system definitely has some flaws
his trying to get you disarmed is a big alarm bell.thankfully he hasn t realised he can weaponize  redacted   which are unfortunately being weaponized by his types.those who weaponize  redacted  bring hatred towards  redacted  and since i have attributes that fall under  redacted   those who only see those who weaponize  redacted  then end up attacking genuinely  redacted  people  including having been attacked and stalked by haters of  redacted  ._.i had to leave the terms redacted on purpose  i don t want to mistakenly give out ideas to such a dangerous man because those who weaponize  redacted  have lawful privileges in many countries and have forced the hand of the legal systems through false  social justice  movements  typically to smear  redacted  by that of parody. they have managed to materialize laws that make it more than likely that the dangerous man would get away with many crimes if if he was to weaponize  redacted .stay safe.
creep ..... his so called  exonerating evidence  adds up to a confession...and he doesn t see it...but then they never do...
a stalker going to the authorities telling them that the girl he s stalking is stalking him. much intelligence. great plan. well at least he saves you the work and he just tells on himself. watching the show to catch a predator it always amazes me how people like this dig themselves into a hole with their stupid thinking.
just another reason i love my second amendment. keeps me and family safe.
i hate this mel! hope things will go better and this weirdo will leave u alone!
this sucks. praying for you.  god be with you.  christ almighty be with you.
he s a conscious manipulator. this is all calculated which makes him more dangerous.
exercise your 2a  get a german shepherd...the dog can stall long enough for you to take aim...hit the range and stay strapped
his obviously planning to attack you directly  why else would he want to disarm you. but you shouldn t have to deal with this kind of behavior. hopefully this will get peacefully resolved but it doesn t sound like that will actually happen sadly
holy crap! i watch the quartering and he just reported on this. this is beyond crazy. well this guy is just trying to force you to marry him. what a wild ride you are going through. hey while you are in court for this in florida  swing on by so that i can propose. ....i m kidding sorry i had to.anyway. i hope you can get this worked out and get rid of this guy... literally... kidding again.
the fact that he tried to file for a protection order to disarm you is highly disturbing. it s a flagrant abuse of a law designed to protect potential victims. if and when you retain counsel  inquire if they can coordinate with the district attorney in his area to maybe file harassment charges against him and also file for a protection order of your own. if he has guns  he clearly shouldn t be allowed to keep them.
need a bodyguard  you got an army...
may god and the holy spirit be with you  watch over and protect you  and grant your serenity.
a piece of advice. he is watching your video replies to him over and over non-stop and enjoying the attention you are giving him. although i find your video responses to him interesting  you should probably stop acknowledging him altogether. eventually  he will probably get bored and leave you alone... maybe.
somebody needs to give that creep an owen hart style tombstone piledriver.
remember  you cannot always have a firearm with you  so a can of pepper spray that shoots like a fire hose. get a slide baton    learn some stick fighting too. there are plenty of sca armored stick fighting tutorials on you tube.
if you see anybody at one of those cons with a big burlap sac  run...
if this guy just stayed shut  we would just pity him and that s it. but the fact that he s trying to disarm her makes him just like the woke mob
this is when living in texas and having the 2nd amendment is going to be a godsend if he does anything extremely unwise for his health.
take care of yourself melonie
whoa the dude is taking the  god guides my hand  route yeah get yourself a rocket launcher or some mounted artillery  he s a step away from  these are jesus  holy bullets
make sure your doorbell reloads.
honestly you should get a gun or something that can protect yourself from this guy or anyone else because stocking easily turns into something worse and you can get restraining order and other things but if that guy goes insane  the court order is just paper   and cops are a long way away.    it also sucks you can t just live your life and this guy take what you are saying and leave you alone.   also travel with friends.
this is like daniel larson levels of delusions. although if that s the case  this guy s harddrive should be searched
dudes going for creep of the year i guess.
im sure a brave individual in the audience or a group of them will take it upon themselves to make sure this guy stops. but in any case  i will pray for you. the police wont help you. they are there for after something happens. arm yourself or those around you.
good grief so sad that people just cant chill
first let me say i do not condone what this man is doing. you re taking the right steps but continue to gather evidence and as one person said when you go out stay aware of your surroundings and carry your weapon i hope it doesn t go any further i hope he does stop but if he doesn t i just hope you can protect yourself and others.
you think the courts would not waste taxpayers  money knowing that you filed a police report against him months ago  and because of that  they shouldn t waste time filing a restraining order.
at first i thought you were saying because he was going to be at a comic con and was wondering if you where going to be at the lunch that was stalking. maybe i heard that wrong. driving 15 hours to a comic con sounds crazy to me. hopefully it s done with and you can get back to more interesting videos about shows  games and what not. i mean you are a beautiful woman   but that s not why i started watching your videos. i know like she hulk show was trash and you said so and it was like thank you. stay safe
as a fellow texan   i just wanted to remind you that you are under the protection of jesus christ. in the end  that is the only thing you can truly count on.  jesus and smith wesson   i will keep you in my prayers.
still can t believe you are 36. but also stay safe people are weird.
hire a professional investigator and call a lawyer.
well  i m sold. i ve done security at the iron horse hotel in milwaukee.  i had to escort a few girls at the hotel to their cars because of guys like him.   the bar manager who was a female said   that s very polite of you.  i was like.....  its my job!   as if i was doing it to perhaps it on em  or do most security people just suck at their jobs
as a florida man  i m sorry about this guy.
now he has exactly what he originally wanted- a relationship with you. i agree with you reporting it to the police  but maybe leave it out of your content.
bruh. he sounds like a jilted lover. stay strapped  lady. if he is as crazy as he seems   this will likely get worse before it gets better.
it is disturbing about how there are red flag laws there in the first place and that the government can violate your second amendment right just because someone makes a false accusation.
he s going scorched earth policy. this could escalate into dangerous levels if he s not put in the psych ward or jail.
stay safe in case he tries to show up at your house  i think you have that covered.  get some cameras if you don t already have them.  there are ones that are super easy to set up.  what a wierdo.
you do realize that him getting a restraining order against you means he  can no longer have any contact with you or he violates it and gets arrested right
very romantic  court papers on valentines day.
and now you can get a restraining order against him since you now have all his info as well.
by his logic  if you ever mention visiting the uk in a podcast video that s basically you threatening an invasion. i d call him a fruit loop  but that s an insult to fruit loops. hopefully the judge or judges that deal with things put him in his place. seriously  it s like a high-schooler being mad he was turned down for the prom.
this man obviously has been in the system and has a history of troubles  if you dig a little  he may have been committed and   or been in the penal system. he may have violated a restriction from a previous run in with the law  he may have to report to perole officer.  sean seems really messed up socially and most likely made other womens lives hell before he decided to target you
there s a hell of a lot of crazy in this world.
sorry your valentine s day was ruined cause of this turd blossom. you ll be in my prayers  and may the whole armor of god protect you.  ephesians 6  13-17
creeps me out everytime i hear her say  sean sar  because that is creepily close to my real name...
it s odd that you weren t served papers until the day before and have no notice of any of his supposed  warnings  back in december with the dms. it s almost like he was building a house of cards against you and then serving you at the last minute - because legally he has to or his case gets tossed - in hopes that you wouldn t be able to appear and get a default judgment. during that time  while you appeal  the temporary ro would still leave you unable to legally carry a firearm. fricking shady games this guy is playing. i can only imagine why he wants you to be disarmed . it s scary to think about. stay safe!
be a consumer advocate for years  i would say if he appeals the case to a hire court  the appellate court this requires more planning and court procedure. unless delusional person actually hires an attorney which i believe  no attorney would represent him because he has no case to stand on factual basis  he will find it very difficult to move forward in the appellate court.  and if he does manage to make on his own in the appellate court you have have 3 judges looking over the case. and i will tell you the higher you go up in the court chain you had better have a good argument with points and authority and a good brief filing. because those 3 judges will knock it right back to the lower court. melanie from what i see  don t sweet this. see what the attorney says to you. but i don t see it going anywhere.  be safe.
sorry this is happening girly  these dudes give us all a bad name. it s always the passive aggressive beta males that are the worst of us.
in my country we have zero right to self defense  so when shit hits the fan you basically pull out old serbian full auto ak and if you re in the right you get convicted only for owning an illegal full auto weapon  and you serve 3-5 years.it s not really much of a comforting thing to hear  but it sure as hell beats dying...
16 11  you just broke drunk3po s heart .
this is a perfect example why the 2nd amendment is relatively speaking a universal right.
make sure you have a good lawyer who follows the rules and is bold and brave enough to put both the judge  this creep  and  if criminal  the prosecutor in their place. judges are so unpredictable nowadays. i watched a lawyer in a civil case school  a judge who was in the tank for the claimant on rules of evidence  courtroom procedure  the state and federal laws the judge was ignoring  and his willful disregard for remaining a neutral party as well as willful disregard that the claimant was using the standing protective order against the defendant to harasses the defendant by manufacturing interactions by proxy with the defendant in a way the defendant could not ignore  ie going after his school  job  and community. it is suspected the judge in the case i observed turned to the claimant and advised him not to appeal his loss as an appeal scrutinizes the judge  not so much the case. the defendant won on a technicality  but it was still a win.the claimant became radioactive and lost his friends  church  etc. the defendant was encouraged to file a complaint to the claimant s employer  dhs  and dod  so he could be fired for violating ethics and pulled out of retirement. court marshaled for violating ucmj s officer s conduct rules  but the defendant said god is dropping more ordnance on this man than i ever could.should the claimant  s daughter and wife get their heads out of their asses  that will be the end of him. there was a heavy suspicion of incest in that family. meanwhile  the entire community is reevaluating the defendant more positively. anyone who helped the claimant has suffered and been scattered  and those who supported the defendant have been blessed and favored. of the lawyers one became a partner  the other started his firm to great success  and those who provided letters  statements  etc  on behalf of the defendant have also seen their lives blessed.i pray the best for you and your attorney.
never stop carrying.
melonie  are you going to play and review the new tomb raider reloaded game for mobile
maybe he wanted to purpose to you in court like bundy.
jesus is with you  may you be protected by the lord and savior. god bless you
welcome to the usa  the largest open-air asylum for the legally insane.
mother of mercy be safe
can you do like a 2 minute tldr version
lawyer up have your day in court. i ve had an ex girlfriend stalk me for years. even sold my home and moved and she tracked down my new home and sent things to it in the mail. it s not an enjoyable feeling thinking your always being watched
yea  this pos isnt going away.  you need to talk to a lawyer and figure out a legal course of action.  aside from that you need to step up your personal security.  doorbell cam  perimeter cams  motion detectors  reinforcing door jams  use dowel rods to prevent windows from being pried open  etc.  if you own your own place theres a lot you can do to prevent intruders  if you rent  talk to your landlord to see what they will allow.  if hes becoming unhinged you likely need to fear for your safety.  firearms are good  but you need more training then just range days  theres a lot more to firearm handling then just being able to shoot at paper.  theres some good firearm instructors out there that can help you up your game and a few specialize in helping women since they tend to be at a size and strength disadvantage.  i would also recommend some sort of grappling hand to hand training as well.good luck.  i hope you can get the law to do something about it but unfortunately a lot of these cases end badly  so protect yourself.
melonie  though we all hope you never have to use it  please make sure you re exercising your 2nd amendment.
get a gun  get a dog  get a lawyer.
unfortunately  people like this guy are delusional narcissists with a compulsion to always win. any attempt you make to block his harassment  he sees as a challenge to prove he s smarter than you and the law. it s truly a sickness. continuing to pray for your safety!
i hope you solve this problem
what a sad strange little man.
my advice melonie is to get a gun. you have every right to get the gun and you have documents to further back it up. do not rely on the court.
wow  cant even stalk and sue a girl anymore without being called names... what has the world come to. ts ts ts.
my advice is to lawyer up.  you have my sympathy  but sympathetic audience members are not the court system.  do not assume that by being right that the court will agree with you.  the  law  is about rules of their game  it s not about justice...
came here from the quartering and this stalker dude is insane. you don t deserve this kinda crap.
a good lawyer would advise you not to say one word at all about this. this is how most people mess up. by running their mouths.
if you got served then get a lawyer and don t just talk by yourself to the public etc.get some legal advice to avoid doing mistakes you will regret.
i m in texas as well. dunno where you are tho but if it s a city they have some really odd carry laws. be mindful of that and stay vigilant sis. you got this. your chat is rohan as well. you call and rohan will answer lol
never watched your videos but i hope you arent one of those anti gun people because you could make one purchase and get you an equalizer.
i liked that straberry shortcake shirt it reminded me of my sister she had all the toys and watched the show there is good crazy and bad crazy this guy is bad crazy i cant imagine how scary this must be for you it sucks things like this happen
you know what s awful and ironic he successfully forced you to go on a valentines day date with him.it s was a court date but still.....it s called  courting  for a reason right
i am not sure who you are  or why the algorithm lead me here.  i would have provided you legal info  but i see the guy was pretty much laughed out of court by the judge.  you weren t ready for court  you got lucky. had you been a male  and the moving party been a woman  the judge may have behaved differently.  all he really had to argue for example  was that you caused some kind of repeated course of conduct over the internet directed at him that caused substantial emotional distress  fl 784.048  serving no legitimate purpose-if even that-and the judge would rubber stamp an order.  constitutionally speaking  there is a lot wrong with the florida statute and even more so in a court of chancery which would violate your jury trial rights  and due process rights if an order was issued ex parte    and i am also not sure how he intended to prove that the florida courts has long arm jurisdiction over you.  your home state is likely guided by the same model code as florida  but has its own distinctions including invoking a different flavor of the heckler s veto.  i haven t taken the time to hear everything this man has allegedly done  but if he is made a criminal defendant and has a competent attorney  you will need to do more than repeat the common feminists talking points erroneously codified in statute.  your assertions that he traveled 1500 miles to an event you were in  asserting a right to be let alone   asserting that he has bad ideas about you being his future wife  asserting that he harasses you   asserting a heckler s veto doesn t overcome his constitutional protections.  there are bad judges and public pretenders  and most cases result in a plea deal  so i am not saying it is impossible to get a conviction-just the case would not be constitutionally sound if all that is invoked is all these feminist talking points.  the constitutional issues are cloaked in savings clauses  which these saving clauses may not be enough to save the statutes either   and the statutes try to unconstitutionally proscribe protected speech through unconstitutionally vague and broad terms to confuse defendants and attorneys  and if you do go this route  it would be beneficial  to show that he called your home phone repeatedly  engaged in  true threats   incitement     obscenities     fraud   such as blackmail   or some other applicable exception to the free speech clause to then prove the elements of the statutes were met.the man most likely needs help  and i don t think that the courts nor the police can give him the type of help he needs.  if anything  they will likely hasten bad outcomes-even coerced silence is dangerous.  the fact that he sued you is disturbing in many ways.  not only is it the initiation of a legal proceeding a hostile act  it seems contrary to what you say is the state of his delusion.  if he is as delusional as you allege  it is an irrational act but typically constitutionally protected....except florida carved out an exception in litigators immunity years ago.  the alleged irrational behavior and alleged escalation is concerning.i don  know what exactly is going on  but i would like to see a de-escalation  way less drama  and a focus on healing.  of course  he could be enjoying all the drama you create in responding to his trolling.
sounds like chris elliott s character in something about mary  but not in a comical way.
he has problem but it doesn t deny him from filing a lawsuit. i have a feeling he lured you into exposing the situation so he can keep getting your attention. i would say stop exposing him and keep it between you  the law  and a lawyer. your channel is awesome for gaming related content but i would keep your personal stuff off of it
did all of this start after you started speaking the truth with go boom  i wonder if some people are trying to mess with you because you are speaking your mind.
i ve said nothing but the truth  and that s all i will say is what is the truth. the police haven t done anything beyond file the report so i am keeping these videos up for my safety. working with a lawyer tonight
@melonie mac go boom  all of that may be true but i m just telling you that lawyers always tell their clients  do not comment or say anything because sometimes you slip up and you give an opposing attorney or judge ammunition against you and now your attorney has to try to fix it.that s why the constitution gives you the right to remain silent in the fifth amendment. it s there for a reason.for instance  you said you didn t have plans on going to florida and then you remembered that you mentioned going to florida to someone. innocent comment. but those are the kinds of things that could be used against someone in a court when you think you made an innocent mistake and then the other attorney gets a hold of it.every lawyer that knows what he s doing will always tell the client to not make any comments. really  you shouldn t have made a comment on the court appearance without consulting an attorney first. you don t consult an attorney only because you did something wrong. you consult an attorney so that you don t mess things up.ask the lawyer tonight if what i m saying is true or not. i am not telling you something to hurt you. i m telling you something to help you. youtube is not where you make your case.take care.
@melonie mac go boom  me saying   by running their mouths   may have made it sound negative to you. it wasn t.by the way  i can t believe you re 36 years old. you look young.
@meloniemacgoboom...  yea i gotta link you can click as well
put out a few videos of you are the gun range and training with experts.... nobody comin to mess with you
ohhh wow just kept watching and you did just this... lolwhat a creeper.
ohhh nuance bro  that is probably why i got you in my feed  that dudes great.
i m only two minutes in  but wow. you have videos of him documenting his own stalking of you. and you have eye witnesses that put him in places where you were  while you had reasons to be there that were business related. he s really trying to get himself in serious trouble. what a moron.
i hate laughing at your misfortune  but this guy s evidence and thinking he can take you to court is laughable
gah this is disgusting  at least you have protection tho  stay safe
not all stalkers are bad though  i mean sometimes they can even be helpful  imagine you get out of you car and its snowing and you drop your phone or keys and a small voice from the bushes says  here mel  and hands them back to you before retreating into the shrubbery! or maybe you break down on a small side street  flickering lamppost and boarded up windows and someone suddenly appears behind your car and gives it a push start then disappears back into the shadows. that wouldn t be so bad. lets here it for the nice stalkers  the ones who have no bad intentions but just want to be near you
the quartering sent me...how can we help  jeremy uber alles!
this guy is displaying a lot of behaviors which are consistent with borderline personality disorder. it goes without saying you just want to be careful. if you haven t already done it  get the best attorney that you can afford.  i honestly don t know how this guy has any grounds for appeal on the judge s decision  but doing that does suggest that he s going to be persistent.  you weren t specific  but your video suggests that he s representing himself  so an attorney can make sure that any of the little legal details that he may throw at you are deflected and neutralized before they reach you and cause you more stress than you ve already experienced.i hope you get past this as painlessly as possible  and that you keep producing your fun videos!
you need legal eagle on your side!
would be a real shame if that guy s address were leaked online and found by a 2a supporter who knows what needs to be done...
this guy wants your attention  wants to be part of your life. so he went this way to get what he want. now you talk about him  think about him and give him the attention he want. now you made him more of him as what he was before. you created the identity he was lacking before. unintentionally  of course. but this was his goal. now he can imagine you as his wife  while he tries to bring you into his life.
sorry you are having to deal with this. people like this make us guys look bad
but  melonie. not trying to be mean or take his side. but just because you block him and he makes another account. he s legally allowed to do that as you have a public domain that allows anyone to watch. just because you don t like what he says  doesn t mean it s against the law. you can t file a restraining order just because you want to. he has to do something illegal. again  not trying to take the guys side  you just have to ask yourself what legal. don t feed into your followers telling you to conceal carry because a guy confessed his love to you. that s a bit over the top  simple because you find it   weird.  i wish i could talk to you about this  i have a good understanding of the law.
36  i thought you were like 26 or something. you age really good
be safe.
any level of fame seems like a pain in the butt.
just make sure you got a good camera system and a good alarm system  so you can sleep comfortable at night. hopefully this creep will move on. sorry you really don t deserve or need this shit
wow dude s legit crazy.
sorry you went through that.
dude is not just showing red flags  he is a factory of red flags.
stay safe melonie
hey mel  if you read this  like it so i know you took my advice.ok all i want to say is to be careful. i watched many videos with stalkers and a few ended in tragedy. i don t want anything bad happen to you. contact the police again and told them it s serious. i m dead serious here. be careful. there are many lunatics out there  and many of them are potentially dangerous!
a desert eagle would be more effective!
this dude can t even stick to his own guns about driving so far to meet her  maybe  20min vid about it then turns around and tries to say that she s stalking him  ! !   she s got so much evidence against this guy he better hope it doesn t come to a court hearing!   he s just trying yo turn a failed attempt at a relationship into a couple grand or a meal ticket to some fame. weirdo
these gym girl tic tockers need to watch this and see what a real creep is
so many human garbage in this world omg  and to think they breathe air and waste resources on a daily basis. how the heck is she stalking you if in your argument she blocks you  that argument already is so idiotic it deserves a criminal sentence.
how has youtube not removed him
please tell me you have a lawyer. if not get one. i m sorry this has happened to you  no one deserves this amount of stress.
this is totally fucked up. the kind of guy some women assume is a large amount of single men  but is really just an extremely small minority  but will always exist. i hope you get the justice you deserve.
so blocking is now considered stalking  wth.
be funny if she s just ends up marrying him so he will stop
some guys cant just stay normal when they see a beautiful woman...i always worry about girls who streaming and have a huge following...this shit is krazy  personally im from the streets...all this stuff about lawyer and court is not for me  he be dead already
coming from the same guy who said he ll treat you right.
stay safe g
honestly  sometimes you need to go for the throat and ruin someone s life to get them off your back. it s not pleasant  but yeah. it s necessary
the guy is insane
he needs to be locked up or he will keep doing it to someone else
i don t trust the fbi anymore melanie i also recommend take this up with the texas rangers
had a crazy guy threatened my family and wrote nasty things on his truck about us that wasn t true.  used court as a weapon like this guy.   sounds like you need a restraining order against him.
she stalks him    lol. mate     even the court find it hard to believe him
lol facts
he needs to go to jail! he s not going to stop! he s clearly delusional and that s a big red flag! better leave that chambered in! hopefully he stops. god bless
i find it highly doubtful you or any woman would stalk this guy  he looks and acts more like the stalker type himself.
holy crap  you re 36  i thought you were like 20 lol
so aint nobody found this dude yet  my sis had a stalker about 5 years ago. he d message her  go by her work  go by her apartment  sit in the parking lot and message her. she tried to get the cops to do something about it  after 4 months the cops had done nothing. i sat across from her apt after work a couple days. second night he pulls up and messages my sis. it took all of 3 minutes to get the guy to never message my sis and never show his face around her again.
you not asking them to but you re not telling them not to.
not sure who you are or why your video showed in my suggestions but none of that matters ... be sure you carry a gun if you ever have to defend yourself and if it means anything to you  you have my prayers
sweetheart him not giving up is kinda implied in the title stalker. as far as i know the proper channels is filing the police report  getting a restraining order  and then if it was me i would be getting a gun for if he breaks the restraining order. granted the extent of my knowledge on this is based on law and order so i would talk to a lawyer about it. how the fck can they disarm u that s insane.
walmart trevor is your creep stalker. insane.
make sure your evidence is not only on google drive.
guy s missing several nuts. do all you need to do to be safe
fucked that you re going through shit like that. just make sure you re not ending up as a tragic story  by any means
this guy seems to be hate obsessing over you. still very creepy. i hope you open carry if he ever tries to approach you
fucking 1010  madness  it s at the point we re he s become a real dangerous threat to you and even the rest of the community your apart of! i don t think this shit stops until he s behind bars or out the  pitcher one way or another!feel scared for you
hey malone do a vid with a police officer and die advice about what to do and it will give you a piece of mind and stay safe.

he uploaded a short to his youtube saying he had a character called  man of chivalry  who bickers with woman and gets into fights seems like he had taken the character too seriously

are you kidding me  he s not going to win to her heart doing these acts and continues to act like a child. also  he s trying to disarm a texan  not likely buddy. that s is called the arm state for a reason.  still  praying for your safey mel.
ur stalker should have just taken the walking l... i m sorry that happened 2 u
too bad for him me too still has influence in the society.and you have all the receipts.also get rekieta involved.

alright it s time to call omgitsbirdman!!! we have an emergency broadcast! code eugene .code eugene!
mel i like you too but there is no way in hell i m driving fifteen hours to see you hun.
this is why we need good men around women. not saying a boyfriend or husband but a brother or good father in your life. so they can keep creeps like this away. guns and big dogs also workps you don t look 36.
holy shit this is some serious shit
well at least he s got a good taste in women. if he went after some like grace randolph you d know the guy has completely lost it.
sue him back
my takeaway... melonie is 36
damn... you look really good for 36 lol
be safe because there are dangerous mens who views womens look pretty as sexual wanting and disgusting just be yourself and let the court know that this dude is dangerous stalker with malice behavior and angry behavior that he can t have you  show the court his hidden psychological behavior

i thought you were like 22 wow stay safe that dudes a wacko.
before i continue criticizing you i want let you know i m doing this with the best intention.that being said  if you use google drive to host your  receipts  everybody can see those receipts. i would advise you make a burner account on mega uploads or some other third-party site. nothing so integrated like google or apple.secondly  screen caps can be faked  we know this . i m not saying the stalker is not real i am saying there s gonna be a higher standard of proof required to prove this person is stalking you.
i m familiar with this flavor of stalker. dangerous. he needs to be shut down.
move to florida! geeks and gamers needs you!
when betas attack!the betas are getting aggressive out there!
everything you say falls on the hinged  and the unhinged alike.  there will be no compromising with this one.
im suing you...will you be my valentine
you might want to avoid the flashpoint trailer  u dont want to hear the words coming out of the flashes mouth
what a massive creep... good thing the judge was good.
this is insane...what happened with the med system...allowing psychos on the streets...mental disorders are seen as normal in the states it seems...
the guy is crazy
praying you girl. unfortunately  you are going to have to destroy this idiot. you need a super lawyer
omg! what a dude.looks good on you though
get a gun and range time. if you already have  get in more practice
i m sorry to hear this happened to you. sounds like you are going to be fine legally but this is so dumb of this guy

the criminal plays victim after attacking the victim.

i wish you that this stops!
if you re in here dude  quit being weird
drunk would be quite a catch....just sayin .
i saw jeremy s  the quartering  video on this.
your fund is up over  7000.  let s see this guy taken down...he doxxed himself - i am here in florida and i know some people that could make this individual quietly disappear - just saying. let s get her fund higher so she can take the right actions...
damn that sucks i m glad i wasn t born a pretty girlfor real though keep that gun close  if you have to use it empty it
good god i m glad i m a man  the world is just getting sicker by the hour
don t need to look that guy up clearly that s david harbour
served papers on valentines day. how romantic. this is a strong argument to buy a glock.
you re 36  damn i need your genetics lol
i know a guy who buries bodies thats all im saying.
i am donating to your defense fund.  everyone who takes the time to comment here.  do the same.  even a dollar per person would make the difference. sweetheart.  i lost a girlfriend  a long time ago  to a man she knew from high school.  we thought he was a friend.  but he wanted what she would not give him  and was sick and evil enough to try to take.  do not underestimate.  protect yourself.  i am a christian too.  there is nothing unchristian about being prepared to protect yourself.  i started concealed carrying after she was hurt.  i decided long ago  that i would never allow such a thing to happen to anyone if i could do anything about it.  unfortunately the day she was hurt  i wasn t there.  i was out of town.  if i had been there  i would have done what i could  but her assailant was over 100 pounds heavier than me and a head taller.  i know how to fight  used to compete   but the reality of fighting a bodybuilder that much bigger than you is you probably lose.  i still wish i had been there.do not allow yourself to be vulnerable.  it makes me sick and sad to think of this  but i m warning you out of bitter experience.  30 years later.  she s at rest.  i m not.
marc maron was stalking you
lol so creepy
the old switcheroo.
he went full floridaman on you. sorry you have to deal with this bs.
you re 36 ! maybe its the camera or some sort of make up but you look like you are 23 max.
oh  he s florida man. that explains everything
i simp for anime women.he simps real women.we are not the same.
it s his only way to be in the same room as you. what a creepy individual.
i like your sweater
wow 36 you don t look it man i feel old you re 6 years older than my daughter ps  i am married and  in thailand
outsider looking in..what is wrong with your country s justice system  what a dumpster fire america is.
where are the links.  looked at description and the links are not there.
i dbl chk d this in google and this is what i found when it comes to your being served.how far in advance must a subpoena be served in texas five days b  a subpoena must be served at least five days before the hearing.  c  after a subpoena is served upon a witness  the return of service of the subpoena must be filed at soah at least three days prior to the hearing.i wonder if he just some random person he knows to do that to you specifically on vday..either way he sucks
thanks!
we have your back.
why you sound like you say  oh naaauur  instead of oh no
i say commit a violence  but thats just me
she s 1 year younger than me  i m 37 so
@matt11708  i m a couple weeks from turning 37  myself.  hail!
you d have people believe that there are no mentally ill disturbed malevolent people in any of the other forty-nine states and u.s. territories. crime statistics and common sense would suggest otherwise.
of course he is taking you to court.  that way he gets to leer at you in person on the taxpayer s dime.
it looks like the creep has been busy deleting his comments on this video.
he should be locked up for years for this.
what a cooked unit
get a body guard  this is bs
wait hes here in florida
poor you. and poor him.
in germany was stalking a problem they change the law the law 2015. because the police coukd not do anything if something was happend and in most chases was it hurt or death. pp  were glad that change but mad fans are verry different. like ex friends or strangers with pychological illnes.  stalket from the internet use a therem the the person is public and so different.
tooo much drama for me.
open carry dude
that s what stalkers do! they are efd up criminals! they will take care of him.....in court!
what the heck  yeeeeeeeeeeesh
i m being stalked. it sucks but you don t deserve it
when simps go bad
i hope you sue him.
plz get a conceal carry pistol. there is only so much police can do.
why don t you use the proof or evidence that you have in conjuction with his and file a counter law suit for stalking you and harassment charges  obviously.
sorry to hear
girl you need a good workout ..... come home a glass of wine and just watch the happiest movie you can find. dear jesus you can t catch a break. but yes makes sense 30 something year old woman stalks 55  year old geriatric abuser. really adds up.....
sorry that going on with you  i m shocked that your 36
2nd amendment shall not be infringed!
lawyer up
lmao
he was from a month ago

damn.
4 11 you re 36    wtf! wow. i really thought you were younger. regardless  stay safe. this behaviour seems pretty unhinged.
this is not theo but his grandfather jason
holy fucking clown horn.  i no longer care about anything but my eardrums...
this is cyber stalking  only once in person encounter  once is not stalking  twice maybe. i hope guys simping for you on twitter does not help his case  if i was a woman i would not make online vids  internet is full of creepers. making this vid gives him attention
melonie  you really have to stop stalking all your viewers.  you have 121 thousand followers that will take way too much time for you to stalk us.seriously  how does this guy stalk you and then take you to court for it   it s pretty obvious who is the bad guy.  good luck with all the court stuff.
7 20 what s up with the edit who s that
jesus  that guy is my age and he harrassing you
florida man  prayge
hmmmmmmmm idk i started following her because of the other youtubers i ve followed for years and they wanted to support this person so i did but she s sounding defensive  if she s done nothing wrong she d be fine why is she trying to show or find receipts  if he s full of shit
the stalker has a problem with a court of law  he has to admit that he is following melonie mac go boom.  in addition  what a weirdo  in this age of toxic masculinity.  the words  go away  creep   should be sticking in his brain.  at that old age to stalk someone that young is a creep  nothing less.  understand these words that should be said   you are trespassing  don t come back.   this is a right.
crazy world
you need new ink. gees.
even if he was successful there s no way you would be disarmed. florida law doesn t mean shit in texas
you re so beautiful
cant you get jailed for this stuff
florida man a about to find out you don t mess with texas women.
i run a private security company
i don t believe her!
what does this guy want with my future wife    back off  man !
too bad he didn t live in vegas  then he wouldn t be a problem anymore.
where is all the links
he has no game
this is just so bad. this guy is off his rocker. while i don t support stalking in any form  he d be blessed to be stalked by you. court should ve tossed this guy to the curb when he filed. good to know you re keeping safe though
you need a better printer  man......or i need better monitor - what s up with those striped pages  p
you thought florida man was bad... that s ocala man. far worse.
textbook manipulation tactics from this guy.
hope you have guns and get a big german shepard dog
you may need to get self defense insurance. us law shield is mine.
dude wtf
f that guy get a big ass dog a growling working dog in your house would love ya and protect ya
36!  jelly  shimada death...
hahahahahaha
dude looks too old to be doing this.
he actually has to do something
the stalker guy probably has ancient printer
@sussy_61  he must be so poor that he made it in dot matrix printer - attorneys are costly  p
or ccw safe is what i have
if you feel that you would have to protect the dog i understand but its a measure of security i recomend for any pretty young lady whos living alone at least i think you live alone
i know right  i just find out as well..  i was thinking she is 27-28 max.
cancel him
maoist struggle session
hes a creep that wants to harm you.
why not mel you seem like his type lol
what a weird guy.
i saw @thequartering s video  and my brain  can t compute. i mean  blaming ...you... and suing ...you... over a  rejection.  this guy  makes me feel better  because i kinda did similar... but as a kid teenager and it was not at this level. this crap is kid crap! wtf
today is in fact the day after yesterday
ppl like that dude sue to get info on women like address etc. hope you have guns and at least one dog. or a good man.
this a real life  play misty for me  good lord  this guy is a looney.
just gonna say... legally you shouldn t call him a stalker. even though you have good reason. came back for this vid specifically. but he is obviously smart and retorting your alligations in order to get you into the same room. something i ve been warned many times about by cops. best advice. stop contact. stop posting his face. most of all. and if he does. let that be evidence against him and record everything. delusion of grandure is something he sounds like he went through with you which makes sense. you re charming and you are putting things on a social forum available to anyone. granted so is he. so don t fuel his fire. and focus on you. and record everything. if you have taken the steps you claim to you are safe. so don t post about it. be about it and simply bring it to court. if you keep posting him  specifically his account or profile or photo  it runs the risk of a lawsuit for definition of character. if he is posting now he is taking it to law. remember this is good. as it will be something monitored in the least. i sincerely hope you end this in a positive manner. talk to a lawyer about it all k.
36  wow!
second amendment   start training in the ways of the fire arm if you haven t
cant decide whether to hit the like or dislike button on this one. sorry you re having to deal with this shit. dude needs to get a life for real
thankfully you don t live in a red flag jurisdiction. you wouldn t have even been given a court date. law enforcement would have just shown up and confiscated.rock on to the judge who was willing to be thorough and check this nonsense.
this is the shit that the stalker wants though. you are using it for content and putting his face all over your channel. you are inadvertently making him a part of your life which is exactly what he wants and is why he s taking you to court too. this is lterally the worst thing you can do bringing attention to him over and over again melonie. i suggest you knock it in the head or go get some advice about it. the more you talk about him and put his face all over your channel the worse it will get. best having no contact whatsoever and letting the police handle it  you are documenting everything atm which is good but you are showing your hand too soon.
what the what
december 27th is my birthday
your audio is super low in this video. the horn soundbite is like 100  louder than everything else
lithium the answer is lithium
holy sht ur 36
florida has no jurisdiction over texas. certainly not your ability to carry.
aaannnddddd subscribed
are you fn kidding me  damn i am so sorry. no one needs this crap.
with melanie
oh maybe eliza bleu can distract him
jeez  this dude sounds unhinged  i am so sorry you are having to go through all this crap. what a waste of energy.
get a gun. stalkers don t get along well with guns.
i have a huge crush on pop star madonna for a long time but an incident at her home in nyc by an ex fire fighter and fight broke out between the ex fighter and madonna security staff after the incident i reach out to madonna and told her with a promise i would never show up to her home without her and her security staff permission i don t drive her crazy i did tell her i have a crush on her and respect her space i hope everything work out for you you re right he s nuts
ok...
stop making videos about him. any further correspondence with him needs to be done through your attorney.
see why red flag laws are are bad idea
i think this dude needs some serious help. he probably believes everything hes saying  ive heard that no one is born with insanity  they progress into it. he needs to get a psych eval. non of this is an insult either nor is it an excuse. just speculation on my part
be careful on what you disclose  it could interfere with any legal process.
wtf ! i was really hoping and praying this whole bs would end after the first video. you are far too sweet to have this psycho bugging you. but i know god will make it all right. and this guy is an idiot playing with fire. he may likely destroy his own self with the lies he is telling.
lol
i can t believe this bs. re-victimizing you. counter sue and take all he has
sorry you have to go threw this crap
he s just trying to be famous
so...is that a sex doll dressed as lara croft in the background
if you change your mind and marry this romeo  i am gonna tell you right now it s gonna end in divorce.
wtf! i truly cannot believe this is actually a thing people do. what would make a person think that this is appropriate behavior  dude  you wanna be that creepy guy that nobody talks to  cuz this is how ya make that happen. this is crazy! the whole getting you disarmed thing is bananas! florida and texas are both pretty sane states  and seems like that s the states involved in this clown show waste of your time  and court resources. this should be something that would land people in jail. clearly this  person  can t call that a man  is wasting the court s time  and money. he should be held responsable for the resources used for his farce. like  every person that had to devote time and energy to address his claims  and you yourself  should all send this dumbdick an itemized breakdown of every penny this has cost  and he can either pay it  or work it off in jail. plus in your case  he should be held liable for any possible damages incurred as a result of him slandering you. any events you couldn t attend for safety reasons  any deals tarnished due to his interference  all that. dude should have to pay for this garbage  and he needs a good ole sign in the yard  saying here s a creepo nutbag. hey  maybe threepio can have his  girl  friend gina reach out to this guy with a fist to the nose lol. i dunno if they re together  but i sure do get that vibe. anyways. the way i handle arming myself is. a walther ppq 9mm or sig p365 daily carry  and beside the bed is a kel tek ksg  with 7 buckshot  and 8 slugs  with a reflex sight  light intigrated into the foregrip with pressure switch  flash supressor  for those moments  when you just wanna handle ya business  and get back to sleep. that s the round 1 fight finisher lol. oh  and if the wife gets involved  she ll grab her benelli m4  or her sig p320  or her ppq  whichever her nails match at the time lol.

hey  just take care of yourself  find good legal advice  and make sure you drink water.this dude is obviously an incredibly insecure narcissist.
the fuck
........dude. the fact this was actually served is bs  unless you made this all up. i highly doubt it. i love fighting people who immediately delete their posts. but this is extremely gross. people like this make con-goers look bad. people go to cons because they re nerds  not creeps.
i mean  i think you re giving him too much credit to start with. i do hope it s not one of those true   stalkers  that you want gone and can t get rid of. i hope you get is sorted out!!
st. michael the archangel  defend us in battle. be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the devil. may god rebuke him  we humbly pray  and do thou  o prince of the heavenly hosts  by the power of god  thrust into hell satan  and all the evil spirits  who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. amen. .
i went volume up because i could barely hear the stalker  then you blast honk honk on full volume through my sleeping house. you re a pro youtuber  fix your volume.
yeah  o.o we men cannot gaurd u 24   7  we have our own shyte to cleanso  make ur problem known   then get the legal system involved. this is part n parcel with being famous. nothing to do with the average joe  who is busy stayin alive. get the legal system to help u  as this is what we pay taxes for.
prove it to us show us the drive
hope this shit goes away
wow  talk about salty men . get a restraining order.
you live in america... exercise your second amendment.
do you own a gun  if you don t  now would be a good time to go buy one.
22min rant and i still have no idea what the judge decided on.
lol  she is like the gym trolls trying to turn normal guys into creeps.
wtf you into   im putting out more public information for security  but  i dont wanna anyone to go after him . its just a made up threat just for some clicks  lol
u got money  simps  put a hit out
i dont like your youtube title.bad grammar.
