what really hooked me was learning that your a Christian and how open you are about your faith. then the fact that youre a tomboy and all the fun  cool stuff youre into. I mean  I think your one of the most amazing women on the planet. I dont have a problem supporting you at all. good video. take care melonie.

I first clicked on your channel to get a womans perspective on shehulk   big fan of hulk myself especially the 90 s animated . I subscribed to the channel because you werent on the man-hating band wagon and that you were keeping it real and I value your take on different topics.  it is refreshing to find that there are women out there that are supportive and hold themselves to a higher value than the values perpetuated by the lame  stream media .

hey melanie. yes youre attractive not just looks but your faith in Christ our Lord  youre a true gamer  youre honest no matter how uncomfortable it may be

some of us guys enjoy watching your content because its so refreshing to see a Christian woman who has openly expressed her faith and your opinions reflect that worldview.

there are plenty of other girl nerds out there doing videos but how many of them are wearing the armor of God and standing against the burning woke legion  keep standing.

no one can deny you are attractive  but its having good character that gave you those views. Imean  I dont know too many people who will knock on  modern  lara croft and then end the vid with Jesus.

wow that money argument makes so much sense. cant believe I hadn't cottoned on to it. thanks for that.  btw  first time on the channel  random recommendation. based and Christpilled
