i absolutely loved the first dragon age game. every sequel has felt like an entirely different franchise though.
i started gaming at the age of 5 on an atari 2600 and i am still a gamer at 44 years old.  that said  dao is one of my favorite games of all time.  the writing and story telling are second to none.  the ability to macro script your party members or take control of them as you see fit was so much fun.  i would love to see a remaster of this game without the darkspawn corrupting it with its wokeness.
the thing about remasters remakes nowadays is that they re usually also  redoing  the story by removing anything that would be controversial to protect the  modern audience . i would love a simple overall graphics and qol upgrade that s what a remaster is supposed to be   but simply that would never happen  we all know they would change things to fit their narrative and it just wouldn t be the same.
dragon age origins is masterpiece. and i really don t want them to ruin it.
the strongest part of dao was the ai and the possibility to completly script up your companions...to a degree that i had the feeling that they were more competent than your usual pug member in an mmo.
story isn t a bad thing in video games. it s a media genre that has a unique method of telling narrative different from the constraints of television and movies film. you can tell bigger  vaster epics without needing to dump money into sets  hiring actors  costumes  shooting on site  etc. games have also shown you can have good gameplay elements can tell the story too.
everything is better without ea involved in gaming. its been proved time and time again. when ea is involved it hurts. it takes a miracle for things not to get fecked.
its crazy i literally just finished the game 2 days ago and currently playing the expansion
it was one of my favorite games. the strategy based attack styles  the multiple endings  the character dependent story lines. just chefs kiss magnificent.
i m currently replaying this as an arcane warrior.  i m wary of a remake regardless of ea s involvement or not because dao is actually challenging  especially compared to da2.  we ll have to see how dread wolf ends up.   keepmorriganhot
i m hijacking this video to talk about tomb raider  is now the unofficial name of this channel  right  but  i d be down for a remaster of da o. my wife and i loved this game  and it was a good balance of story and some difficulty. there was even a boss battle i couldn t beat.
my worry is the way everything is going now they will try to make everything woke which will be horrible also i m pretty sure that it would mostly be a loot crate base thing or something like that and i highly doubt that bioware would be allowed to do it without ea
i have played this game all the way through like five times and yes  i would love an ea-free remaster.
i played dragon age  origins through many times with different characters. it was so good.
an immersive story is what grabs people and keeps them coming back for more with or without the big and flashy graphics of today. chrono trigger and breath of fire are just a couple examples.
my favorite fantasy games were the old d d games like ice wind dale  neverwinter nights  baldur s gate and planescape torment  my personal favorite   i loved the rpg feel to the games. can t forget microsoft back in the day  they had some good games.
i love they brought up jade empire. that was one of my favorites and i waited for years for a sequel but never got one.
dragon age origins with the remaster  cut content restoration  gore upgrade  and nude mods is easily one of the greatest games ever made. easily my most replayed non-mmo game ever.
i ll be cautiously optimistic... from one side... it s ea and we know how easily can screw things up but on the other hand... we got mass effect legendary edition and dead space remakei hope that in case of a  dragon age origins   remaster remake  we can lean towards the most optimistic route
morrigan and alistairs dialog as your companions was freakin gold lol
i was going to say  bioware has problems that go far beyond ea.
bioware died when the last doctor left.
the first one was the best.
ya  especially dragon age 2. that game was way different
i have never seen a franchise more mismanaged than dragon age... okay maybe star wars... and i am still pissed off about how mass effect ended
not so much a different franchise  all three da games were distinctively  dragon age   but they definitely felt like different genres.
same here my friend same here
yes  same here.
same here  80s represent o7
keep gaming 4ever
it makes sense that you like dao if you grew up with a2600  as dao is actually a remake of my favorite a2600 game --  adventure.
and suddenly i m reminded of the artificial  intelligence  of the companions in dai. fking hell  i played as a true tank so i didn t have to rely on those sprouted potatoes.
it was my first fantasy rpg and opened a world of games to me. absolutely loved it.
a remake remaster without current day censorship  for a modern audience  crap... i m highly reluctant to see that happen in these crappy times..would be nice  but i don t see it happen. dragon age 3 got a lot of woke  uglification crap shoved in. and that crap actually ruined mass effect andromeda with a day 1 patch.
not as old but feel the same i play dao about every year and have thought about how awesome a remaster would be but to turn it woke in the process would be a sin greater than the magisters corrupting the golden city.
same here i am still gaming at 49
i agree 100  but if it keeps going like inquisition went then we are doomed.
hell yeah fellow gamer i started gaming at around 8 or 9 and i m still a game at age 37 bro
what were sabertooth tigers like   @subflow22
same. my parents bought atari 2600 for christmas and i still game to this day
at 54 god i remember breaking so many of the paddles on those early consoles.skipped a few generations and got back into it with sega megadrive and again with dreamcast.ps1  2. last console i still have is ps3.didn t like how playstation screwed us on backwards compatibility. so i m really into pc gaming and vr now.
yall thirsty for something new
as much as love the entire game  i especially loved being able to customize each party member s combat behavior.
your comment reminds me of my childhood. the atari 2600 was my first console too.
agreed. the fanbase is bog enough they don t have to fold.
great word play
@snapdragon 9600  you mentioned paddles. did you play kaboom on the 2600   i remember the rotatable paddles for that game.
it was my favorite series. i remember when it was announced just the thought of having a knights of the old republic style game in a dark fantasy universe was pretty much the best thing that could happen to an rpg. it lived up to the hype without a doubt and is without a doubt still a masterpiece  and ea has been ruining the series ever since.
part of why i think they are doing so many of them.
kinda sucks when they make  a  remaster  and you need like 20 mods to undo all the agenda    for modern audience  crap...
ahah xd xd also no ping problem
i don t disagree  but i also don t think story is necessary.  most developers seem to think it is.that said  i do love it when the gameplay or mechanics reinforce story.  one of my favorite examples is how in sleeping dogs  the narrative is about the undercover cop sort of losing his cop identity as his criminal idenity takes stronger and stronger hold  which is reinforced by how in cop missions you start with maximum points which are lost as you make mistakes  while in the triad missions  you start at zero and have to earn up your points  just like you re having to earn your street cred.  it was a subtle difference but a genius decision.  it could very easily have been  earn points  for both  and no one really would ve noticed much difference.
for a lot of games it s necessary. however  a lot of games need to understand their audience. a multiplayer focused game doesn t need much in the way of story. games like cod or battlefield should really sell the muliplayer separately as it s own game. the single player should be sold as a separate thing for a cheaper price. since the bulk if their audience doesn t even touch the campaign  which makes zero sense to me.
generally speaking they shouldn t prioritize story over gameplay  and many games have done just that. tomb raider reboot  the new god of war games  30fps with an awkward and restrictive over-the-shoulder camera perspective   uncharted  etc.
da origins is a masterpiece till this day.
origins is the best in the series by far  the latter games felt dumbed down and had much less darker themes
@goofball1 _  i never played 2 and couldn t get into inquisition at all. i tried a couple times and spent a few hours trying and it just failed to pull me in the way origins did.the combat was so much more fun and satisfying in origins and the characters and story were far more interesting. after playing through origins several times i was really excited to play inquisition  only to be very disappointed.
@kai k  facts i just started dragon age 2 like 10mins ago. i finished all of the da origins content
@goofball1 _   da 2 was eh for me. inquistion i liked it at first but then idk why i felt after awhile it became a chore and i eventually did beat it but never played it again afterwards
@jack m  dao has the best executions sync kills. by the gods  with mods to update everything  it s amazing!
if they do it like the remaster of demon s souls on ps5 it would be great.
@doug hultgren  everything i ve seen of demon s souls remaster makes it look way to easy. i saw a blind playthrough on youtube and what was arguably the toughest boss fight in the game  where you re fighting that tough creature and another shows up when you get it half way down  and this guy just killed both instantly with one fire spell without even taking a hit. i lost all interest in the game after seeing that. maybe magic is just really op and doing a non magic build would still be pretty challenging  but i d like to be able to do a magic build without feeling ridiculously op like could in the original.
i haven t seen that.  but my play through has been the same.  it was just a huge improvement in the graphics  which is what i was looking for.
@jack m  magic is completely op and broken in demon souls classic. it sounds like that transferred over to the remake.
@kurgan0822  idk i tried magic in the original and it seemed really powerful in the early game but you definitely weren t one shotting the toughest bosses later in the game  or at least i wasn t.
every so often mm  should make a compilation of all the times  since last compilation  that she s ranted about tomb raider. hey  if she doesn t  you know someone will    do you mind if i call you mm  i feel odd calling you just melonie
yes  more breath of fire the entire series  remastered would be awesome.
mine  too.  i play all of those at least once a year.  it ll be 25 years in 2023 since bg1 came out.  all those games hold up even to this day.
let s go even further back.  remember champions of krynn and its sequels
none if those games are from ms though... you meam crpgs
@commdante  no  but they were old d d games  dragonlance
no i couldn t think of the microsoft game but it changed rpg games with the technology they developed. i believe it was dungeon siege. of course  microsoft prob didn t develop the technology only took the credit.
ea sports ncaa football  25  each button on the controller is a  1.99 micro transaction
@david franz
@david franz  don t forget you have to pony up  .99 for each play called.
dead space still felt the need to uglify the characters and add trans bathrooms. so we ll see. im sure they ll want to highlight zevran being bi or something.
agreed  morrigan is still one my favorite characters in gaming of all time. the romance options seemed earned and took time throughout the game to develop.
knowledgeable and entertaining. i love how passionate she got at the end. great video.
i have mixed feelings about this. on the one hand  like hollywood  the gaming industry is creatively bankrupt lately and they can t seem to come up with anything new  so they ve started reaching back to older games and remastering remaking them. in this case i don t necessarily think it s a bad thing because i think it brings in a younger audience that never played the classics when they first came out  or if you re older like me  maybe you couldn t afford to play them as a kid. the re 1 and 2 remakes are prime examples of a successful remake as well as the recent metroid prime  no pun intended  remake. now re3 was a let down and the trajectory of sh2 is looking grim  not in the way it s supposed to be  which is what is giving people a lot of hesitancy lately when it comes to remakes. as for the gameplay in dragon age changing from the turn base to real time  i was actually good with it. i liked the game play in da2 and 3 but i just think da2 was rushed and therefore had a terrible story and a terrible world to explore and da3 started down the woke path. if they just updated the graphics on most of these games and did a 1 to 1 transfer of the gameplay i think the publishers would have a slam dunk on their hands. but like disney ruining star wars and amazon ruining tolkien they have to screw it up by injecting modern politics into the story and alienating the fans. they might as well just toss money into a can and set it on fire.
i went back and forth between dao and mass effect. i didn t play games at all when either released  but circumstances have me little else to do. it s an awesome game!
i love the dragon age series and recently finished a replay of origins!   would love to see a remaster if it can be done well!
dragon age  origins is my favorite game of all time  and you hit the nail on the head. a lot of the recent fan base is just a bunch of women who started with inquisition  some who won t even bother playing origins or da2  yet claim they love the series and play games for the story  lol.  i saw this one guy  and he was cute. then  i saw this other guy  and he was cute  but then something bad happened to one of the cute guys  and it was sad.  that s what gaming is nowadays for those people lol.
haven t played dragon age yet. i hope with the remake won t be too watered down like most games are today. great video melonie! glad you re doing well.
the point of stories in games is for the player to feel part of the story  and you do that through immersive  and fun  gameplay. most gamers get more immersed in a game through the gameplay and playing out the story rather than watching out the story. for instance the dragon age games changing events and the story itself based on your choices in the game  rather than just changing the dialogue for that conversation only  that was the biggest pull for dragon age for me at least  being able to see how my choices effect the game and the world evolving around my choices is an awesome feeling. the best thing about origins is even when you are deep in combat you still feel in control and you feel the need to take control of your party members to survive and utilize them. sadly  the other 2 dragon age games do not do this as well  leaving origins on a significantly higher pedestal over the other games. but with the outdated graphics many people cant get into it as well.
dragon age  origins is one of the best games ever made. it is incredibly deep  great characters  amazing soundtrack  and it has so many choices and different endings. it is such a rich and complete story  that it didn t need sequels. it was the complete package.
crushed this game with an arcane warrior blood mage build back in the day.
preach it sister! cater to the niche!the reason the atelier series is so popular is the niche catering. you play the atelier series you know you ll be working to gather and maintain high quality resources  eventually automate manufacturing  and lots of crafting and battles all against a timeline. the reason i didn t enjoy atelier meruru and atelier annie were the miserable city building aspects that detracted from everything. it brought in an element i didn t need or want to enjoy the actual gameplay.if i want to city build  i ll just play master of magic  downloadable on steam . it s like a deep dive into a fantasy version of a game of risk  full of city and army building  and having to juggle everything. loved that as a kid and as an adult. if only western devs could figure this out. we have been blocked out by the casual nongamers who typically buy a console for one game then sell it back after playing it  zelda and the wii comes to mind here .keep booming. love your videos  _
my all time favorite game is baldur s gate 2 and from day one i have played it with core rules  ad d rules . i loved it from the first moment. the gameplay was fun  the story engaging  the graphics fantastic and the difficulty was hard but so rewarding. those battles with irenicus were extremely hard  epic and finally beating him was the most rewarding battle in all of gaming for me.games being hard is essential for me to get any sense of accomplishment. dragon age  origins was the same way. the really hard battles were so satisfying to finish  like the desire demon on the fourth floor in the circle tower .that is what i loved about elden ring too  the difficulty. for me doa is perfect the way it is. would it be nice for it to be upgraded with todays graphics  sure  but i wouldn t want the original version to be forgotten. but i m afraid that an upgrade would remove the gore  the bad evil dialogue choices  like seducing camen at the dalish camp . i don t trust the developers to not mess with the game itself in order for it to be  updated for modern audience . i would just prefer to just leave it alone.
i ve actually been a massive soulsborne bender the last few months.  i recently went through elden ring and have been farming to get ready for the dlc. i ve been catching up on your old videos while farming which makes it go by super fast. i ve almost got my character at ivan drago level before the creed fight now.
that was the most blatant abrupt switch to tomb raider i ve heard yet. just throw the gloves down like that   i have to applaud that. its like the fans go to a hockey game to see a fight  and they are enjoying the passing and the line changes and the pipe organ and then rob ray and tie domi drop from the ceiling and start pounding on each other then the fans stand on their feet in applause  d
dragon age origins  one of the staple rpg s still to this day. loads and loads of content  base game   addons   great branching story for different races origins  decisions that actually matter and unique micro management gameplay that hasn t been used often if at all  outside of pc games  i played them on ps3 . the graphics were great too imo. it s a shame how the series fell of a cliff with 2  which  imo  was a decent enough rpg  but nowhere near the quality of other rpgs of that time  especially origins. inquisition was better than 2  but couldn t grab me that much. it was nice that decisions carried over between games. unfortunately that wasn t always carried out very well  probably mainly due to the protagonist shift of da2  relegating the rest of the origins cast to short sidestories .i d be very interested in a remake of this game. i do hope they do optimize some of the dungeons maps  because i remember some of the to be extremeley long and boring  dwarven ruins come to mind . but the overall stories  and side content is one of the best gaming experiences i ve had.
i would love a dragon age origins remake. as a ps owner  i don t even have a way to play the old one anymore. i liked 2 and inquisition as well  but origins was on a whole nother level
it s just smart to cater to your target audience. how many times do we have to see a beloved brand grow within it s niche only to fall once it tries to appease the masses  so many times.great video mmgb.
i would love a remaster! this game really deserves the loves
man  dragon age origins is 1 of my all time favorite.  its literally a sitting gold mine in this age of woke entertainment.
i loved this game still do. it s such a great game. for me this is such a nostalgic game. great combat  amazing story and a great character diversity nothing too cheesy or too overbearing. i think it took them 8 years to make. i would totally buy the remake and i hope they give a small discount to those who have been bioware fans. if not i d buy it anyway. ea has the opposite of midas  touch instead of gold they turn it into crap.
dragon age origin was my favorite game of all time
the thing that i like about dao over mass effect was it s old style conversation system. i prefer to know exactly what my character is going to say. in mass effect in attempt to make conversations flow they started with the one to 3 word answer wheel and you ended up saying something completely different to what you intended. in dao and kotor i felt my character was truly my own. in mass effect i felt like i was playing as one of three types of shepherd
@baugh jaughes  the problem with me is that the game tells you that the bottom dialogue options tend to be the confrontational renegade options  but that s not always the case  and sometimes shepard not only says someone you didn t intend  he says something that s not even close to what you chose
dragon age having  origins  in the title always made me think it was a prequel. is it  or is it actually dragon age 1
@t00nyboy  it s the first one.
@peachbooty  sick. i ll get it on the  cries  ever-expanding list
@t00nyboy  origins just means you get to pick the origins of the main character  like 6 different background you can play through at the beginning of the game for the different races. its the first and best version of dragon age. though the gameplay is much different than the other 2  its more like star wars kotor than da2 or inquisition. imagine if inquisition let you play a unique intro for you character instead having a paragraph of text telling you the origin then starting the same for each.
@anon  i ve never played any of the dragon age games  so thanks for the clarification
thank you
@melonie mac go boom  you re welcome melonie! have a wonderful day too!
haha thank you!
this reminds me of what i was just talking about with hyrule warrior age of calamity  and breath of the wild. how the warriors game still stuck to the way it is but made it a little different with legend of zelda aspects  so it worked well.
good afternoon  melonie! loved da origins  so a remaster  not a remake  would be amazing!hope you re having a great day. you look gorgeous today
dao was my first rpg  will always have fond memories  would love to see a good remaster.
i was excited for this game to come out and when it finally did i was disappointed i even talked my friend into buying it and he loved the game as well haha
i hope so! i loved dragon age origins!
i wish more remastered would happen! but i also really wish they could update   make slight improvements on aspects of the game. the ground work is already set so it should be much cheaper to pump out! i know it s not always that simple  but imagine making me legendary but updating those 3 games to have the movement   combat more similar to andromeda! that would of been siccc! of course not as simple as it sounds bc ai would have to be updating also   environments slightly altered  but i do believe it s still completely feasible. it s feels kinda sad that i even want og classics to be remastered but that s honestly bc the new games just ain t it! they miss the mark time   time again. it s almost like the generation of developers now just ain t gamers  they are hired to make a game strictly as a job but their heart ain t into making a good game as much as it s in it to get a pay check. i think current creatures just aren t nearly as capable as older developers. we had so many doo-doo games back then too  but really in this day   age how many brand new ip hit the mark  it s like games are getting worse across the board! ok running out of new ideas to innovate  np just refine then   work hard on having the absolute best stories possible! unless the new developers   writers just plain suck at their job  where are the great new movies   tv shows  we get what 1-2 movies   1 tv per year that is really really good
i love  story-games . the first one i played was probably final fantasy vii  before that i was generally playing  rinse-and-repeat  games like pvp football  racing  fighting  etc . ffvii blew my mind  it was epic and i fell in love with the story-game. i loved both dao and me and would be happy to play a remaster of either. i love being able to dictate the gameplay based on the decisions i make but still having some free-roam ability. for instance  the elder scrolls has gone downhill imo. although skyrim has much better graphics  i found the stories seemed to be very segregated  like you completed one entire story arc in one area of the map and then moved on to the next. there was just no real link between the story arcs and it frustrated me. whereas  with morrowind  and even oblivion  the stories seemed to be a bit more interlinked  so your character couldn t progress on story arc until it reached a certain point on a different arc. it just felt like my character was  progressing  throughout the game  rather than  becoming arc mage  and then  winning civil war  and then  becoming dragonborn  and then  becoming master thief  and then and then and then and then... i like a story but i literally mean  a  story  not 10-15 mini story arcs that don t even overlap.
i love this game. i have lost track of how many playthroughs that i have done. i just started one a couple weeks ago
i played the crap out of this game  i absolutely loved it! one of the best games ever made in imo.
well the story and world building is pretty important if your talking about rpg s but gameplay should be central focus. it is kinda getting harder nowadays as the turn based gameplay is outdated. it s harder to action based in medieval fantasy setting when characters are using swords and physical techniques vs mass effect which s combat lean more to shooter gameplay. a good example of medieval fantasy combat i can think of would be as u mentioned is soulsborn series or monster hunter.
i remember my friend mep being in love with dragon age back around 2010. shame the franchise seems to have fallen out of popular conscience  i don t hear it being discussed much these days
david gaider s characters  cassandra is my favorite  were my favorite in the series  it was truly a sad moment when he left.
honestly  i feel the vanilla dao game could use a refresh like the mass effect legendary series.  a little more customization and glitch fixes couldn t hurt either if it does not interfere with the storytelling.  doa had a perfect balance of mult-story and action that gave it great replay value.
dragon age is and will always be a awesome game.
hey melanie. your explanation on the acrobatics and calculations for tomb raider is on point and is part of the reasons why i love that game. exploration and puzzle solving where also fun. i originally played is on the sega saturn. even though it was the inferior version  it s what i had and i loved it.
i m personally late into the gaming sphere because my parents were more controlling and wary of games but i personally love niche games even if i personally wouldn t enjoy the game itself because i find interesting innovation in said games. i m 1 of those people that find some of the  tech demo  games appealing because you re likely to find something that hasn t been tried or was tried poorly due to various reasons. gravity rush is something i enjoy and i hated how the sequel was them trying to bring it to mainstream because it lost its innovative spirit somewhere along the way... i know it s dumb but it was intriguing to me
this is great  melonie! you have no idea how long i ve been waiting to hear this news. my ps3 is busted and can t continue da inquisition  ps4  unless i go back to origins and 2 to make my own story arc.
dao would be an ideal candidate for a remaster. having released right at the start of the transition to high resolution displays  dao quickly became unplayable as high resolution displays took over. yes  there s some mods that attempt to repair non-scaling ui  but they don t apply to the entire game and they usually distort other elements of the ui. its  at best  an awkward experience. relatively small improvements to dao s ui  textures    lighting would being the game up to  at least  minimal viable standards for today. but could they charge for that facelift  doubtful. gaming should return to telling these quality  multilayered branching stories. they ve really become a rarity today as the art of storytelling dies.edit - regarding the tomb raider games  its worth pointing out that tr2013 wasn t only the best selling tr game at the time of its release  it outsold all previous tr games combined during its run. after the sale to embracer  the full sales for the entire tr game franchise were made public. 88m in total  with 38m coming from just the survivor trilogy games. that didn t include mobile games  which embracer stated had sold around 53m paid mobile downloads  not mtx from those titles. those figures were made public by embracer in may 2022.
while i am cautious about ea i just have started playing wild hearts . it is amazing game   the company has been so responsive on patches as well as add ons   the game has been out less than a month and they have added new komono as well as nerfed and buffed weapons in the game .hoping ea won t screw this up because  they have been doing well for this game
as long as it s just a tech update and facelift that would be great. i want the combat system to stay the same. i still love playing da origins today  but it s a pain when i have to go in to disable all but one cpu core every time i start it up.
i would argue that since two the series has lost its identity. inquisition is so different in feel  art style  and side content it s hard to believe they re in the same universe.
dragon age keep.
@brian thompson unfortunately  my ps3 is  busted and i wanna redo the story arc
much like oblivion i played thru da multiple times  man i miss those days!!
dragon age is absolutely my favorite series  a origins remaster done right would be a dream come true
the dos windows emulators that are available now are just about perfect compared to the emulators a few years ago. the hardest vintage pc games to run are from circa late 90s to early 2k  run perfectly now via emulators. i used to have to jump through several hoops and spend dozens of hours researching several websites on how i can get my blade runner game from 1997 to run on windows 10  and i even had to create my own scripts to automatically mount the img files as virtual cd-roms. now it s not a problem.
i 100  agree with your sentiment on modern gaming - i d be interested in hearing what you and your audience think about morrowind vs skyrim
good topic.  enjoyable games  those were  had good fun with da2. inquisition s soundtrack was tremendous.
dragon age origins is proof that good story  graphics  at the time it was a pretty impressive   and gameplay can all be done right in one game without sacrificing anything.
this is one remaster i d play. i never got to finish bc my comp crashed and wiped when i was like 40 hours in. couldn t bring myself to restart but i loved the game.
ur looking good melonie  glad ur doing ok sis stay hydrated and stay safe god bless
i would say yes. bioware edited out all of miranda s ass shots because they thought they were tasteless and while this didn t ruin the game the editing itself was what was really in poor taste.can only imagine what ea would do.
i hope so!!! been waiting forever!!!!! better armour and gear i will buy it all day long!!
it s possible as bioware works more with the unreal 5 engine for me5 they will have more resources and experience to delve into past titles. i would love to see jade empire  neverwinter nights  and dragon age  origins have some new life. as for your description of niche hardcore challenges... i am now 65 and i ain t what i used to be as a gamer. i appreciate it when franchises have difficulty levels and don t just cater to the elitists.
when more streaming  i miss your chill streams  especially with something as chill and fun as hogwart s.  d
i think a game can have action and a good story if its done correctly
would love to see devs farming out their old ips to third parties for the sole purpose of making the games work properly with current gaming rigs. no need to remaster. doa is fun and looks amazing on my ultrawide monitor...until it crashes again and again
dao is 100  perfect the way it is. any change  no matter what the intention  no matter how small  will only fuck with perfection.
i would love a remastered version as a collection of all 3 games and hopefully a demo for da4 and the animeted movie as a bonus plus maybe some new stuff  id played liek  80 for for all of it   i would love for thrm to intergrade the dlcs as a part of the games.. i never played the other games like blood bourn or but i got elden ring and i loved it  i agree games should try and go for more niche types stuff
origins is one of my favorite rpgs ever  put that universe into my top 3 fantasy settings. whatever happens to the ip  at least the original will always exist.
most hilarious moment resulting from a mod was due to the original nude mod for dao. the scene where you and a group of wardens are partaking in the grey warden ritual and one member overdoses and dies... the moment becomes comical when everyone  including the guy who just died  is completely in the buff with a massive erection.
the only thing i hate more than a cutscene is a cutscene with a quick time event!
i want all of the dragon age games remastered
morrowind had a better fleshed out and more interesting world. skyrim didn t trap you into a build  but was also heavily simplified just in general. skyrim was also more fun to just wander around the environment.
they were kind of tasteless as a mass effect fan i never really had an issue with them but they were clearly there just to show off one of the few sort of non boring human characters body.
@chandller burse  to each their own i suppose. miranda s ass was memed for a bit after me2 s launch but the biggest issue ppl faced with the game at the time was how boring jacob s character was written to be.
@leonardo da vinci  oh man  i totally forgot about jacob s name. i only remembered him as that one biotic teammate i never used. everyone else i could remember.
@melodusdethicus  right
@melodusdethicus  i wished we got a batarian instead.
yeah i m 34 and my reaction times are nothing like they used to be. also  life is stressful enough that i don t enjoy stressing too much in games.
mood
omg  i am just playing this game right now for the first time  it is amazing.for some reason i had the game on my steam library but never noticed it and played it. so yea very good game.
i m new to the bioware style rpg.. i do quite like inquisition although hadn t finished yet.. i d think a remaster of the first two dragon age would work packaged together with dlc   all.. especially if they re hyping a new title in the series
man i regret so much not saving that post i think it was on bioware s old site or forums. people were up in arms talking about how they shouldn t have sold out to ea just after bioware announced it  so one of the main bioware guys posted this whole message about how they would keep their autonomy  and that ea had agreed to it and that this was a great deal that would give them focus on making games instead of having to take care of the administration side of things.i knew it was bulshit then but damn it would be great to have that message so i could share it every time ea fucked with their shit.
origins is one of my favorite games of all time. in my opinion it was the true successor to kotor.
i remember that the original medieval total war even included paying attention to where the sun was. and now they are just casual arcadey games where i don t even fight the battles anymore. this is partially because your troops just passively regenerate now and it doesn t feel like it matters if keep the maximum number of your troops alive.
origins was the only one in the series i ve ever played.  it was a good game  despite the flaws.  it was also the last complete game that bioware ever made  if i remember right.  bioware was gone completely and replaced by ea before da2 finished.
never played any dragon age title. but  as far as remasters go i d like to see soul reaver brought back.
mass effect was supposed to be a sci fi rpg. during development  they leaned into the action while still keeping some rpg aspects. that was before ea bought bioware. during development of me2  ea bought bioware and mass effect turned into a story-heavy third person shooter. me3 tried to blend 1 and 2. unfortunately  ea rushed development  added multiplayer  and the story suffered. ironically  the multiplayer hoard mode was one of the best parts of me3. i think dragon age was bioware trying to return to their rpg roots  but then dragon age 2 happened....
people forget these days that a game can have a great story and good gameplay. you don t have to pick one or the other  developers.
will ea ruin _____    the answer is always yes.
i d love to see them do a remake under one condition. nobody is allowed to touch the writing in an attempt to adjust for  modern audiences
given ea s history of half efforts  nhl  and pulling the plug on perfectly good properties  project cars  we hardly knew ye   fewer ea money-mongers  and more developer-side idea-mongers  sounds like an idea so crazy  it just might work.
oh yes  because modern bioware has shown just how capable they are of producing a good game without adult supervision  smackshead!
5 32  bioware romantic scenes never were exagerated. plus  by that time  technology was barely capable of making such scenes  without being embarassingly artificial. i remember in mass effect 1   the naked butt of that soldier girl still had some  unpolished edges   how to say this in english  . but i still liked  it was the dawn of a new era.6 26  i played jade empire 1 or 2 years ago. i couldn t evolve the character  due to crash. it s a great title for a remake. for tr  i still have to play the 3rd  the only old 1 missing for me. it crashed after the cg. but i didn t try any fix yet.12 15  the  action-oriented  was an improvement  because it just cut the waiting for the character make the next attack. since dragon age 2 got way more challenging  making the player have to refight over and over the same battle  because you lose a bunch of times each fight   it would be annoying to wait that time  1 or 2 seconds  at each round. btw  if they will relaunch the 1st game  they must add all that challenge from the 2nd  otherwise the whole project will be pointless!
all they have to do is update the graphics. but they would want to  make it appeal to a modern audience  and add micro transactions.
no ea with da origins would be a dream come true after they botched the mass effect remaster
my biggest thing is gameplay. if it can produce a quality experience then i love it. otherwise it s a nogo for me
interesting  hope you re doing well melonie
i would love a dragon age remake remaster. but i d settle for it working on current hardware.
i played all the dragon age games except for inquisition cause my disc was malfunctioning. and psn never let me buy it from the store. and when i got a second copy  my ps4 overheated with controller drift lol. but now i can finally play on ps5  hopefully . i can t believe it has been 13-14 years since dragon age came out. i feel like 1997-2010 was a longer period of time lol. times goes faster when you re older usually i guess.
i dunno. the writers that are left at bioware are nothing but woke tiktok rejects.
@eyes of ascension  yeah  but it s dao writter that s telling this.
@eyes of ascension  does that mean dread wolf is going to be us trying to talk elven lives matter out of destroying thedas by making tevinter apologize for its mage privilege
@alwaysplotting2096  don t forget that even tales of arise went woke by talking about racism the entire game lol
@alwaysplotting2096 when the tales of series goes woke you know the whole game industry is completely loony
it s funny you mention niches and elden ring. er didn t really enrapture me that much despite how much i liked all the other souls games. appropriately  armored core 6 got announced  so fromsoft is going back to the niche that got me into fromsoft games to begin with. i m so hyped and hope it s as niche as it was back then and not trying to appeal to lcd to try and ride the er masses.
i loved dragon age origins  played through it several times  but i just couldn t get into inquisition at all  and i tried a couple times.
dragon age origins is one of my favourite games of all time.
15 13 - bookmark for myself for what i need to listen at work when approaching a meeting. tell it melonie
hey melonie hope you are doing well with yourself and hope you are having a great day and week too. anyway i have not heard of the video game or have i not played it either but i think that it would be a great video game to play and i think it would not be a great idea for the game be remake without the ea company bc it would not be a great picture and platform and storyline for the game for it to be played without the ea companies involvement in the game  ok melonie. anyway that s my opinion on this topic and i don t know what you think about it or what anyone else who thinks about it too. anyway i just wanted to make a comment on this topic of your video for today  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great day today and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
dragon age origins is one of the best fantasy games made on consoles. it s sad that it is also the best in the entire franchise. i would love to see it get remastered.
i agree with most of the time having a way to just port them over is better. most of the time they remake a game they ruin it. star wars battlefront could have just been given a fresh coat of paint  no changes to the game dynamics  and it would have been like printing money.
yes please!  personally  i think the series went downhill after origins ended.  i spent 30 hours i ll never get back earning my emotional investment in the mage-templar war.  then i pushed start at inquisition s title screen.
i freakin love dao  imo it s the best game from dragon age franchise  so those are great news! i hope they do it right.
melonie should go on vince dao s show.  he s another rising star
you have got to be the biggest tomb  raider fan ever lol but seriously melanie love your content you do an awesome job. keep it up
still play it today. it s one of my favorite games. the sequels were disappointing  but i still played them.
ea ruins everything it touches.
you are right about the classic games -- for example  see how many streamers play games like doom  quake  half-life on playstation4 or emulators or something other than a native steam port which should be easier
i would love a dao remaster. a complete package like the mass effect legendary edition would be really nice. nothing crazy.
dragon age  origins  was a classic example of good writing  and great story-telling.  it s gameplay is really really bad  tbh.  i liked how it emphasized the dialogue and story-telling.  edit  the more i think about david gaider coming out saying how much he wants a da o remaster the more it makes me annoyed.  he is pulling the old  ea ruined it   completely down-playing the ineptness of bioware to develop a sequel game.  inquisition was released in 2013!  they have gone through several re-do s on the concept of the game  starting basically from scratch after.  ea is a sports-game company- i get it.  they aren t known for good rpg s.  but bioware used to be  and now... they are a shadow of their former self and don t even know how to make good rpgs anymore.  anthem sucks  andromeda is hot garbage  destiny was ok i guess but still not good  and inquisition was also only meh.
i remember when ea rammed daii out the door  and how disappointed i was after the tour-de-force that dao had been...
wait  he wanted it without ea  that could be interesting. i loved origins in and ii in high school and love anything involving it in game form.
i loved dragon age origins. played it so much. but dragon age 2 was vastly different from origins and i thought the skill tree got confusing. i gave it a chance  but i ultamately dropped the game
one of my favorite franchises i walked away from thanks to ea. won t touch another d.a. game including legacy titles if its connected to ea.
@anti-bs
one of the greatest games that i ever played was on the ps2 and it was called shadow hearts... the game play was awesome!!!!!
the more i hear you talking about the original tomb raider  the more i want to play it  but not sure how i should go about doing it on stream. like should i get the original one or the anniversary version also totally agree  take pokemon. the game is like legit easy. there is nothing hard about it. back in my day cinthia was the hardest boss in any pokemon game i played before. now  the elite four is so easy i barely have to use potions or revives.
imho the only reason to reboot it is because it was such a fun game and it would be cool to play it again. i enjoy the whole series  and the multiple endings are really cool  especially the ones in inquisition.  it s funny on all the da series it s actually woke without being  woke  for the most part if that makes sense.
i m just gonna assume you were mispronouncing gaider s name honestly  da origins was my favorite in the series.
ah  dragon age. a game i kind of plan on playing after hogwarts legacy now that i ve finished the mass effect games
origins was great. definitely the best of the series
i ve never played dragon age  but it sounds pretty interesting.
i liked inquisition but i liked origins more given i was able to duel wield swords. also the elves didnt look weird.
i remember going to the ea headquarters in sillicon beach. from melonie s opening statement  sounds more like sillicon leach!   mental cue that one scene in stand by me
dragon age origins is great  that game has a soul to it
i m more into simulation  sci-fi  management type games but i also love games with a good story. that being said i don t really like challenging games and the reason stems all the way back to when i was a kid with mass effect 1. now you may think that me1 wasn t very challenging well the challenge for me was trying to find where i was supposed to go when i got into the galaxy map. it took me about a year or two before i figured out that it literally told me the planet and the system it was in. looking back on it now  i am both laughing at myself and feel really dumb.
i have always wanted them to update dragonage with the dragonage 2 fighting system.
totally agree. i need my fantasy rpg fix  i don t want modern.
that s funny  this xmas i spent some exyra time with the family and installed a bunch of old games on an old laptop  one of those was da o. i remember loving that game back in the day but now it just felt really dated or maybe it s me. only played a little bit since i didnt have the time. i guess a remaster would be interesting.
dao understood what a true rpg should be. but over time with subsequent sequels its been watered down and simplified. i d love to play my favorite game with new graphics  but they better not add a dialog wheel.
i honestly haven t played an ea game in such a long time. btw cute dog
at this point i don t want them to touch it. i adore da o so much it s one of my favorites. i already have to suffer with dragon age 4  i don t need them ruining the classic as well. just leave it as it was when it came out. 2009 glory and all.
i think that s why i ve been getting bored with most new games these days they concentrate way too much on cutscenes as well as e3 trailers to sell people on features that are either watered down from what was advertised or just not in the game period   they don t concentrate not nearly enough on gameplay   replay-ability.i ve been replaying ffx   manhunt.manhunt it s brutal  sick   twisted but for some reason i love it
yes  remaster please! i hate how the old version crashes ever so often.
i want graphics. i want a texture i want gameplay  and i want a story all together. i want the best cutscenes  and i see nothing wrong with the sex scenes.as long as it looks good  all they need is a but to choose if you want to have the sex scene it s simple as that.
anniversary is a playskool version of the first game. if you want an actual tomb raider experience not catered to the mainstream babied down gamer  you ll stick with the original 5 games
@melonie mac go boom  oh ok cool  thankfully steam has the original ones so all good. after tomb raider 3 what are the last two original games
when you say sci-fi management games  are you talking about empire-builders  have you played stellaris
@t00nyboy  i have it downloaded but haven t found the motivation to play it yet. i wasn t trying to be specific  more general.
@apocalypse  it s a lot of fun in the rp aspect. i m having to relearn the game for the dlc and update on the console edition so i can play as the reapers with all the mass effect species. i ve got them set up to turn all life they capture into cyborgs and turn all bio-product they collect from organics into new ships
if they can get away from ea for this reboot then hopefully they remake it without having to worry about  modern audiences
i would say bioware never understood the dragon age series either. they made something extraordinary  origins  by accident  and have been deviating further and further from that with each consecutive game.
i feel the dragon age team would woke it up all to hell.  but..  they did remaster the mass effect legendary edition without inserting a bunch of current politics.  well almost  didn t stop them from cutting the miranda butt shots.  they just couldn t friggen stop themselves.
drunk texting always a bright idea. edit sober. interesting question fantasy or sci fi id probably choose fantasy also. makes me try to imagine aliens or terminator etc translated to fantasy. theres a free audiobook on youtube aliens  phalanx. actually quite good with traditional xenomorphs  demons  within a medieval setting pre industrial planet.
it wasn t called  shipping  then. da o had real role-playing roots  the options for romance were not out of place.
if anyone is going to ruin dragon age  whether that s a dragon age remaster  or dragon age dread wolf   it ll be bioware themselves... they can t seem to hold onto high level employees long enough to finish single game these days. and dread wolf has been in development since 2015  about 8 years  and there s literally nothing in terms of gameplay to show for it as of now. that s not a good sign in terms of what bioware is capable of currently. i wouldn t be so quick to blame ea  some future dragon age game doesn t turn out well.
gaider was involved in the writing of the second game  which was godawful both in terms of a story  which requires logical plot progression  consistency  pacing and possibly character development  and in terms of an rpg  which needs to account for reactivity to player choices . ea might have imposed a small development window on da2  but it was the devs and writers who made one poor decision after another to turn that game into the mess that it was  starting with changing the overall style  atmosphere  and aesthetics of the first game. and in the leadup to it  while laidlaw was bashing dao to hype up da2  and in doing so  showing how he disliked the game and had no idea why fans enjoyed it so much   gaider was only too happy to echo his thoughts like a good lapdog. the blame can t be put entirely on ea s shoulders  bioware had a hand in dragon age s decay too  and gaider was a part of them. even if what he says is true  then so what  remasters are cheap cash grabs at best  excuses to censor and mutilate the original products at worst  and they re honestly just masturbatory and a sign that creativity has officially run out. gaider would be better off trying to make a spiritual successor to dragon age  origins with an independent company that doesn t repeat the previous mistakes  not whining about some wish fulfillment that big bad ea not be involved with his ego stroke.
is it even possible to make it without ea don t they own the rights
i preferred mass effect 2 over 3. i am a casual gamer  mostly because of time. saying that though  if i pay  60    i would be upset if i beat it in a day. i liked dragon age  origin when i played it. i think i would prefer keeping fantasy over science fiction if  one had to go away. i still enjoy playing symphony of the night  or batman arkham city. skyrim remains one of my favorite games  i like how if you can  you will add tomb raider to your commentary. have a great night. god bless.
this game is still the best rpg ever released in my opinion.
as much as i love the original da o  and what could they do other then give us better combat higher level cap  i have to say no to a remaster even without ea the hive of scum and villany that they are i can t see the game being good. i m also still bitter about inquisition a decent game with 2 horrible dlc that basically left the next game in a bit of a bad place narratively cause i m not going to help the dread wolf.
origins is easily the best of the series  on all gameplay and story levels.   morrigan and alistair are up there with liara and garrus in my all time bioware top characters list.if  what now passes for  bioware get their hands on a remake  they ll destroy it.
dao is one of the best rpg s ever for me atleast. well written game before ea fucked up everything. awesome game overall.
the gaming industry grosses more then the music and movie industry combined.
dao was such an amazing game played that game non stop
i want a legacy of kain series remaster!!
not giving age away much lol  my 1st gaming was on atari  tennis frogger tanks etc. my biggest hates in modern games are long cutscenes  collectables and achievements . all are designed to flesh out a game with little gameplay substance in my opinion  tomb raider accepted as you are raiding a tomb thus by extension  you are going to collect something   i m talking about running around the map for hours picking up random objects  not needed .and achievements don t get me started what ever happened to achievement being beating the game  and not for example  you have picked up your 1st ingredient which you are going to any way as it is part of the dam game. cut that crap out and give us more gameplay
my two favorite games from my adolescent years fallout new vegas and dragon age orgins both need redone dont mess with the writing
i miss the old  bioware  so much.
yeah  dao runs very glitchey on steam even with mod fixes patches.
didn t the actual creator of dragon age leave bioware too  yeash
@maddison price  yeah bioware is pretty much a new company these days. pretty much all the senior staff from the older games is gone. so whatever bioware puts out next  won t be the same as what bioware used to make. and i don t think a can be blamed for that... at least not solely. mark darrah even has a youtube video where he talks about some of the inner workings of bioware a bit.
like dragon age was a spiritual successor too...
i feel like most people preferred me2 over 3. 2 didn t have a hugely controversial ending that betrayed almost every valuable element and setup in the franchise
here is a fun fact  the dragon age games evidently outperformed mass effect games in sales  and yet ea never seemed to understand that  by investing more time and effort into the me games instead.
i freaking love dragon age origins it was soo freaking good 2nd and 3rd ones were meh. i would love a remaster as long as they stick 100  to the original game and lore. ea doesn t understand games at all anymore
how much does motion capture cost. i feel like a lot of games would be better if they fucused their effort on other things. i mean some games need it but it would limit an rpg where you  should have a lot of choice. i think even spoken lines should not be  considered too important.
dao was a fantastic rpg  if they do nothing but pretty up the graphics and fix some bugs then i m in. do not touch the story or the dialogue whatsoever.
...perhaps gaming s just going through a phase...
true  rebooted tr is pretty easy on hard level  sadly no ironman mode
dragon age origins was so great. i played it 4 times... the sequels were naf  couldnt be bothered finishing them
if you liked dragon age origins  spiders  the company makes the most similar games that i can find to this style greedfall and bound by flame
dragon age origins was a great game. still a true old school rpg with group management 40  hours of gameplay and deep lore  but also pretty and well made. all the other dragon age games were less and less interesting to me - just too action  console like gameplay.but then again  as a gamer of 30  years  i always was the baldurs gate type gamer and never the tomb raider jump run fan.
you are delightful !  thank you for being you!
da-o was one of my favorites
i wouldn t say it downhill and the story and gameplay are equally important
2 15 games are now concerned about making it very fucking difficult to navigate a menu in the middle of a fight
at least we still have mass effect
if they ever do they remaster for dragon age origins on newer gen consoles it s going to be a while cuz you ll have to count dragon age origins awakening dlc cuz it s a big one
best dragon age hands down. i loved that game and each sequel that came after it i just lost interest more and more.
i think mass effect was more immersive where as dragon age got away from the more traditional strategy rpg.
i really liked origins  but the other games just didn t do it for me
sounds to good to happen but dare i say it ea has been doing goodish lately
this is a very important message. as a resident evil fan  i can t stress enough how much i don t want call of duty  fortnite  dead by daylight  and dark souls in my resident evil games. i just want the basic resident evil  niche  as melonie has stated. these video games companies really need to stop the bandwagon of capitalizing on the  current thing.
nice mordin avatar.  i agree that it would be awesome if bioware simply made the graphics up to modern standards  and fixed the buggy gameplay  and nothing else.  but i feel like they would change the story options.  remember how you could kill an arl s son and sacrifice his wife in blood magic.  you could side with literal werewolves to slaughter elves.  that kind of dark fantasy  gritty options game is dead  i fear.
as someone who played the original game and has played most ea games.......ea is pretty much guaranteed to ruin it. if ea does the remake then its a hard  never buy  even at a steep discount.
why not cater to the niche  because it s not profitable and gaming companies aren t charities.like it or not  the original tomb raider games were developed in an age when gaming was limited to a very subset number of people because we were the first generation to have computers in our childhood and teenage years in the 90 s.but today  you have already generations of people who grew up with computers and consoles since they were born. and you have those of us who grew up in the 80 s and 90 s  who keep playing. the market expanded massively. and the experiences people want out of games grew different. you have either people who just want multiplayer games  or people who want to basically see a film they can participate in alone  which is what single player has become.
i created the perfect lara croft with blender and soon i will publish it  everyone will freak out
to be honest  i played both the original tomb raider and the new version  and i like them both. granted  i like them for different reasons  but i do like them both.
i fell like tomb raider was made with the current sony formula. epic story with graphics and enough on gameplay to be not trash. i wish more developers focus on gameplay.
as a fan who plays dragon age i don t think we need a remaster now a remake in frostbite would be cool
a full-on remaster  prolly not. but a game inspired by origins  i mean...that s not a bad idea.
it was an elegant game  not as crude or clumsy as current woke trash  but a game for a more civilized era.
they would have to use claudia black for morrigan. i can t imagine her snark with any other voice.
non of the bioware sex scenes were gratuitous. they were all edited and blocked so you couldn t see too much.. they also kept it brief. i don t know about inquisition and andromeda.
dao was the only good game in the series in my opinion. two is pretty much universally hated and three seems to be more liked  but i thought it was only marginally better than two. i would love to see a remaster  but only if they don t have a bunch of re-written things for  modern audiences.
yes! i would love that. no ea would be the best way to go. sadly  they are strangling that series  and the next one will be what kills it and bioware will fall after another failed mass effect.
i just hope it will not suck
dragon age origins is my favorite game of all time. but literally the only way i would buy it  is if it remained the exact same game  expansions and dlc and all  zero changes  just new graphics.
yes  yes they would
needler gun   best home defence.
i was playing tr the other day. and i still get stressed when the  chun chun  churururururururu chun chun  music starts. xd
i support this
it s of topic but goes to playability   my friends favourite football game to this day is still sensible soccer because it was just fun and playable!
11 01 exactly that exactly what happen to command and conquer and red alert both owned by ea
claudio black    did she transition like ellen page
@david franz  typo. thanks for pointing it out.
i ve seriously considered remaking the first game in skyrim as a mod.
dragon age died after da o. the divinity  original sin series   baldurs gate are where it s at. if larian remade da o that would be the only way i could see it being good.
what hasn t ea destroyed
i ve resumed once again playing  everquest   on project 1999.talk about dated graphics. but i wouldn t have a pixel changed. and i liked the update they gave to the graphics just before the luclin expansion  but  still... original please .in fact  i came across an old game client from 1997 or 98 for an mmo called  twilight lands ... 2.5d  not even 3d...at one time i had tried updating a character model to 3d... and while accurate... it lost most of its charm.
i like dragon age. i played the original.
they might ruin it  the dead space remake was great but ea ruins more franchises than it helps
so much truth! subscribed!. dragon age origins still very good story but not replayable now. not like mass effect or chrono trigger. dai only worth 1 playthrough vs the 30 replays for the 1st two games.
you also have to calculate to say certain dialogue option to be able to clap them virtual cheeks.
i loved that gamebut  the chances of any modern retelling being good is slim
yeah  i don t think ea really  grasps  anything gaming related.
bioware unfortunately doesn t need ea to mess up their games they seem to be pretty good at doing that all on their own.
hmmm does melonie like tomb raider  as for a remaster of da o sign me up if it s simply a graphics up scale and maybe paying a ton to vas to speak every protagonist line.as for accessibility with gaming i only really care about disability accessibility which da o and most other crpg games always had before mass effect. it was filled with depth and complex systems but you can pause the battles to strategically set each battle artistically. i also wonder why there s no kotor remasters seeing as those games function only slightly better than jade empire but have the love affair with bioware ea and lucas arts. i mean they re still making star wars games.
i m a inquisition fan myself
i would love a  remaster  but i also wouldn t turn down a full remake.  origins has not aged well.  so long as they find a way to keep ea from meddling in it.
ea is a plague  always has been  since the early 2000 s.
dragon age  origins is the best of the series and like it s sci fi counterpart  mass effect  it s all you really need from its respective series. if ea isn t involved  there is hope but we are still well into the doldrums of woke subversion in our hobbies so i ll reserve judgement for now.
dragon age origin and awakening were great games. dragon age 2 had potential but 1 it was far too small and 2 it was rushed to high heavens and it showed. dragon age inquisition... it screamed to high heavens i was supposed to have been an mmo but at the last minute got a thin coat of single player paint layer quickly splashed over and because we didn t have time to properly finish the single player part... well we added a facebook game in the game called the wartable where 99  of all the missions where... lets watch a timer count down in real time...
ea we are in you money
tbh the game needs a good remaster with all the fixes. the game has a lot of bugs. without mods they are very noticeable. you have to mod the hell out of this game to get it to run on modern pcs. and even then  it can still run poorly  memory leaks  random crashing . it s such a mess of coding.
ea ruins and mediocritizes everything they touch
facts
they did do a decent job with dead space. gotta give them that at least.
it takes two and dead space remake.
@peer165  a whole 2 games cool
i legit think david gaiter is a good person  and got taken advantage of by both ea and the people on the da writing team that he mentored  if that s the word for it. da2 s production was a nightmare  granted  and ea is bad with expectations from their projects. origins was a lightning in a bottle _masterpiece_  even with the effort put into inquisition  bioware was never able to recapture the gritty weight origins brought.that being said  i would play the absolute fuck out of a dao remaster.
so many mods for da games don t really need a remaster.
remaster  it s not that old
what about the new god of war. you can t tell me melonie doesn t just want to melt in kratos s big beefy sensitive biceps. and i heard he s good with kids.
what you are really asking is why can t these aaa companies make some b games. maybe the reason is the same as why we don t want aerospace companies to make toilet seats.
i think it s possible that they don t make games in that way anymore because modern developer don t know how to do it. i don t mind good stories and cutscenes i think it s possible to do both and make it good. however i cannot stand uncharted 4  that game simply over did it with cutscenes. some of them would go on forever and i was just thinking will it ever get to the game
if a game is fun and engaging  i really don t care about graphics.given the option  i would prefer da  origins  gameplay over the original mass effect s.for the record  my favorite games are almost exclusively snes genesis era  with a handful of ps1 n64 era games .
origins and jade empire are perfect... how dare you!!!
that sounds great!
to answer the picture s question on would ea ruin it.... answer is a hell yes they would ruin it
you talked a lot about tomb raider in this remaster dao video. i think it would be awesome if they did a remaster of dao but only if they don t change a single little thing in the game. this includes the story  the characters  all the tons and tons of lore. everything is still there. the spells  the abilities  everything. just update the graphics and that s it. leave everything else in the game alone. remove nothing. then i will be fine with it. i m very big fan of dao. i love that game to death. i still play it. it s one of my most favorite games of all time along with skyrim of course. as for tomb raider. i liked the 2013 tomb raider game and the sequel. laura was a badass in that game. i know she didn t look the way some people wanted her to look. so what  she still looked like a young woman. the cutscenes added to the storytelling aspect of the game. also there was a lot of history and lore and back story to that island she was stranded on and i liked that aspect too. what would the laura croft you love have done differently if in the same situation  answer  she would have done the exact same thing as reboot laura did. storytelling in video games and movies and tv shows. that s what people want. isn t it the lack of storytelling the biggest thing we re fighting against in the entertainment industry
i m afraid of remakes that are not capcom! haha western publishers might  reimagine   rather than a proper remake.
wow  that would be awsome
while i do agree that todays tripple aaa games became more  casual  dumbed down for masses of sheeps...there are still amazing hidden gems like pathfinder  dos2  bg3  wateland 3 and so on. you just need to dig more to find the best
no  because someone will want it for modern audiences  that don t exist . maybe run it through nvidia remix.
i couldn t even get past the beginning of the 2nd reboot tomb raider game because they introduced some kinda weird card system that smelled of potential microtransactions.
regarding how da  inquisition turned out  i highly doubt a remake of da  origins will be anything but good.
origins was good but i do remember people being upset when they made morrigan ugly.  her concept art was very pretty.  after that dragon age 2 s story line was  i m gay!  gaaaayyy gay gay gay im gay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dragon age inquisition story line was   i m trans!!!!!!!!  trans trans trans trrrrrraaaaaaannnnnnnnsssss         im trans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so anyways...   a remake   yeah whatever sure.  if someone could make them all good i m down.
i would rather see a spiritual successor. you don t need the dragon age ip to create a game the way you want without interference from ea.
yes melanie a pretty story
i hated the rebooted one and have zero intentions of playing ragnorak  it looks like everything i hate about modern games. flashy graphics and story without enough gameplay substance
don t lie. you know you want to pay 2k for an ergonomic stainless steel commode
i d argue don t just remaster the first game. reboot all the sequels too since none of them amounted to anything  especially since they stopped following leftover plot threads from origins and awakening. hell  not even the sequels were consistent with which story they wanted to follow.
well  what ea did  did wih both dragon age and mass effect   first game relies heavily on rpg elements and its an instant hit. so now they know what works and to appeal to a wider audience  they fix what not broken  so the second game is not received well by the fans of the first and profit drops. so  the third game has to combine elements of the previous games to appeal to all  which is what they should have done in the second game  in the first place. so  balance is restored  but there are casualties along the way. miranda lawson for mass effect and the worst offender was what they did to morrigan. disgraceful
makes video on dragon age  spends 1 3 of it ranting about tomb raider  lol
i d buy da origins again. especially if not done by ea.
how about a full trilogy remaster 1-2-3
well  i ve been gaming since the first system made it out.. pong.. yes.. i am   an original video gamer   and even pre-video   on our high school computer  with ibm teletype printout  no screen  .never played dragon age much   i was a huge mass effect fan  played it thru several times as different versions. loved it..not sure i even still have this game  or if it plays on xbox one x or series x   have both  ..
i absolutely agree. tombraider reboot is inferior to the original games. i remember being hyped for the first game and then when i bought it i m like  where s the tomb raiding   lolas for a remaster of dao i think it would be great as long as ea doesn t do the dumb crap that ea does. bioware has always been the master s of rpg ever since kotor. kotor was the best and still is  to this day  the best star wars game!
ea doesn t have a grasp on reality  will never support these triple a s anymore...
i have to disagree with melonie  gameplay and story are equally important to me as far as rpgs go  if it s lacking one of them i tend to slowly lose interest
yea ea would definitely ruin it
there is no way that dragon age  origin could get a proper remake in today s social and political climate. it would be a freakish hellscape version of itself. hard pass.
loved the original tomb raider games  the gameplay  the puzles and imposible jumps  they were really fun. then i got the new gen  and i was confused in why a tomb raider game was a survival  story focused action game with more in common with farcry series or uncharted...so bizarre  i uninstalled after a couple of hours  if i want farcry i play farcry.
yah if were being honest has there even been any franchise or stuff that got better after ea got their hands on it after the 90s
melonie is correct about a lot of her criticisms regarding old vs new tomb raider  however  she s wrong about the difficulty factor. look  a game should be challenging  and maybe new tr was too easy  but the difficulty of original tr was broken. there s a difference between a game being difficult and a game being needlessly frustrating. original tr s  difficulty  was just trial-and-error  the game basically forced you to die for no reason so you just have to memorize steps to avoid dying again. trial-and-error type difficulty like original tr is not the fun type. the difficulty needs to be such that a player can still intuit the goal and respond accordingly in real time  not just die unexpectedly and have to repeat the same sequence over and over until they stop dying.
what doesn t ea ruin
inquisition was a killer sequel in concept but didn t have the same heart   grounded nature as origins. replay inquisition today   it s insanely relevant  world going mad  but ya  not as lotr as the original. way better than dragon age 2 tho
i have no problem with story driven games  so long as gameplay itself is not compromised and the story isn t crap.
idk dragon age seem to go woke since part 2  even change the art style and focus on charactors story more then world build like those japanese rpg game with charactor 10 map 1
melanie  thats not necessarily fair to say. i spent two hours against a boss in wo long  just getting my ass beat into the floor like a sick masochist with a smile on my face. at the same time i love me a squaresoft..i mean square enix cutscene. i loved pumping the difficulty in mass effect 1-3 to legendary and rocking out.games are a medium for story telling. they can be like movies with the graphical fidelity. instead of just being a spectator  your the main character. it can have more emotional impact than a movie could. along with some kick ass gameplay.my favorite example of this is gears 1-3. watching santiago go through hell looking for and eventually finding his wife and the aftermath is the first time i believed games could be more. i never thought a game could connect with me on an emotional level outside of anger or hate. i grieved for the loss of santiago. i felt his pain and then the loss of him. i highly doubt anyone would consider gears of war 1-3 to be a soft game.da inquisition was spent too much time in the hinterlands. also all the companions outside of varris sucked ass. i don t mean to be conceited but could they make 1 attractive follower. cassandra looked like well her and the elf sera looked like she was strung out on heroin. viviane could have had hair... more people like fantasy than science fiction. or are easier to be able to get immersed into fantasy because its based loosely off the past. where as a  technological future isn t as popular. hence the clerks 2 moobies debate.i hate uncharted. the gunplay felt worse than doom. not 2016. 1993 94. you know the snes dos game. the story was okay but the gameplay felt like a horrible version of cod zombies from mw.i put 400 hours into mass effect. i put 200 hours into mass effect  2. i put 300 hours in mass effect 3. most of that was replaying different endings and difficulty modes. also 3 had coop...i m probably on the short list for fans when it comes to hours melanie. these games have tons of replayability with different builds and different story routes.love me some divinity. so much so i was ecstatic when lariat studios got baldures gate 3. a great company making one of my favorite series with the competency to pull it off.there is only 1 soulsborn game thats not accessible and thats sakiro. either you can dodge parry whatever the last one was or you can t and die...but repelling like a ninja is sooo fun.i mean i ve always considered platformers like old tomb raider and mario to be more of a casual gamer thing. i wouldn t call them niche. hence the broad appeal of both characters. they weren t terribly difficult or challenging games to beat.hey leave martin sheen as the illusive man alone he was friggin gold in me2.
games babied down  games got babied down because western developers took notice of what japanese developers were doing to make games accessible and followed suit.

dragon age origins is a straight forward adventure game.  if ea demands that it be woke-ism is bizarre  because that isn t fun.  if you want a motion picture  go find one.  the cut scenes can help the story  and this is part of marketing and exciting the mind  so that people have something to believe in and connect to the game universe.  i ve seen this from the very beginning of personal computers  where the game box sells the game more than the game itself  with marketing bragging that they could sell cow patties in a box  if they had a good box design.  make the cut-scenes fun.  if you don t have game play  it is a bad story  because the players aren t interacting like they should  and then the bad reputation will hurt you.
that would be intereresting...admittedly dragon age 2 tanked almost completely..and there s a reason the refer to the third game as  dragon age  the apology   even so....the replayability of origins was insane...they not only had  6 distinct stories that created a diffrent expereince each playthrough..they wrote the script so you saw what happens to the paths you didn t pick. you literally were given extra incentive to go back and play it all over again.  brilliant.  then the 2nd game was painfully linear....inquisition at least played lip service to the branching story concept....  though it was plenty obvious to me the game was written with the elves in mind  and the dwarves almost completely ignored. at least the qunari kossith got some development.  we all know the next one is concentrating on tevinter  and elves vs humans with qunari as a 3rd column will be involved.  no mention of the dwarves.
kwasade for the algorithm.
i have all the series and expansions. i would love a remaster  not remake  because the old game is a little bugy.
remade for today s modern audience.
dao and it s dlc do need a remaster  there are so many bugs and glitches that console users have to deal with. then there s the limit of 10 character files  which each dlc uses a separate file  if you wanted to carry your character over to awakening  then to golems of amgarrak  then finally to witch hunt  you need to use 4 separate files. which leaves only enough room for one more character to do the same. da2 needs a remaster as well if dao if gets getting one  don t know how the save file transfer thing is going to work though.
i played da o on 360  and loved it  but because of life issues i never finished it. if they remake it shot for shot with a modern engine  and don t de-beauty the female characters  i will absolutely buy and play it
removing ea is always a good thing
i believe his name is pronounced gay-der. forget origin  i d love to see a rebooted da 02 with new maps.
dragon age origins was good.  enchantment
i d rather not have modern bioware do a remaster of origins. they probably wouldn t be able to help themselves and want to  fix  something that was problematic in the game.
they haven t even remade or remastered the kotor games yet. origins needs a remake remaster less than kotor does  and kotor is still up in the air right now.
yes. ea would ruin it.
da o was the last great game of an era  i ve been playing games since the 2600  but have always had an affinity for rpgs  i stopped playing new games after the da o2 debacle  that game was horrible   i just played free  home grown  downloads for the pc games i already owned  i just started getting into  new  rpgs with divine divinity  original sin  but there has been a long arc of shit games that take 10-15 hours to play  quick cuts and my dog could complete in an afternoon  a remaster of dragon age  origins would be great and welcome. look toward the indie market  some great games coming out of there.
i m not gonna to see broodmother remake uh imagine
graphics mean nothing to true gamers that care about the the gameplay itself. i played dao and me1  2    3  and while i played me literally to the death of my 360. i played dao only a few times  and never played any of the sequels. because ea had already shown it s influence in bioware starting to seep with me2  and bioware became fully  eaifyied  by me3.also for the record  me1 was my favorite of the series.
in my experience ea ruins every game it touches. i personally boycot every game that comes out from ea. i never forgive them for killing command and conquer series. every game they bring out is a very slight difference to the previous one. look at all the sport games they pump for money each year. it is the same formula over and over again. some people in general complain about a game cost money  but buying over the same copy over again and over again each year  just because it has a different title  is ok. i am glad they lost their fifa license.
hell the series needs a reboot with out ea and bioware
with da4 coming not doing a trilogy pack like they did mass effect would be weird imo. get a proper save-game carry over system
inquisition missed the mark. so did dragon age 2
hope no one turns it woke. needs steam achievements and more content more enemies and char customizations.
ea is one of if not the worst game companies ever. i love their older games like road rash. i still play it on my sega cd once in a while. i d love to see a remake of it but i don t want them to because of how ea is now with them being focused on micro transactions. when i pay  60 or  70 for a game i want the full game i don t want to spend that much for a game   have to pay to unlock everything just to progress or beat the game.there is no feeling of accomplishment in that   it s pointless.
they will force you to marry the gay elf in the remake
there are only two games that are even close to dragon age  oeigins. ocarina of time and ...of course ...skyrim. dragon age is my favorite game experience everrrr!!
matt laidlaw wants a remaster
origins works perfectly fine on modern pcs  no need for a remaster.
there ll be trans characters in dread wolf  you watchps3 works fine on my 4k tv  but watching dvd s is like when we switched from video tapes to dvd s
why not both story and gameplay  legacy if kain exemplified this.
it doesn t need a remaster but maybe a texture update and a dx update though.dragon age origins and most bioware games never had high quality graphics because it s was a rpg.geneforge is better than most rpgs nowadays  never forget gaming ruined film and cinematography and now film   ruined gaming.
ea is a souless company. bioware had no chance
other than the deliberately false dichotomy with the dwarves  the game was good. also  gaider shouldn t misattribute corporate stupidity to  common wisdom . there s nothing common about it  and the amount of  wisdom  in ea s decisions in the negatives.
she act like a game is bad when it has a great story and decent gameplay. when today most games are more about maximum monetizations  decent gameplay lack luster story and of course  unfinished games with the mindset of  we ll fix it later
rtx remix is on the way folks.
dragon ages sex scenes were hardly gratuitous  maybe a bit simple. but not gratuitous. story was what drove the game the game play was dated as hell even for the time and awkward.that said i would kill for the remaster  been dying to replay itthough david gaider makes  me nervous the original director was great but gaider seemed to be behing some less than great stuff later. i remember him going off on fans when dragon age 3 early stuff made morrigan look like daniel radclif
yea they would destroy it if they tried to remake it just look at most remakes today  if it ain t broke don t fix it
i personally like inquisition more  though i am in the minority there. no plans to play dreadwoke.
even without ea i have no faith in modern bioware to go back to the dark fantasy roots that da came from since inquisition focused so much on cringe marvel style humor
ea owns bioware tho
for all the emphasis  and money  on the  story   why is it i feel da o s story was much better than it s sequels  particularly how they build up and do endings.
i agree the dg origin was far superior then it s sequels
i never said they were  i simply said i didn t want them to be in response to a tweet i quoted
i love origins but if it will look like inqusition i think  i will prefer the current version. the original has so much love and detail in its design. no comparison to the plastic look of inquisition.
for those  gamers  who just wanna enjoy the story without even a shred of challenging gameplay  you might as well just support the tell tale games like wolfenstien...etc. heck just go and watch movies then if youre too lazy to hold a controller mouse and keyboard
i ll take a remaster. won t have to pull out the ps3 to play the complete edition then.
stories in video games are important doesnt matter if you care about stories are not in your games but modern videos do not have good even decent stories like older games have origins being an example of a great story with great rpg mechanics
ea doesn t understand gravity so...
i hope so  dao was amazing  an absolute masterpiece. although  the rest of the subsequent series was cringe.
combat was so padded fans of the game use the  killallhostiles  command during replays. good story  but combat was kinda tacked on
of course they will ruin it.   i have zero faith left in anything
kotor. graphics weren t great but the dialogue  story  and game was awesome. graphics weren t great but those great convos between npcs was great.
best case scenario is not a remaster  best case scenario - they will leave dao alone.
each game s universe should represent what the  reality  of that universe. screw the catering to whatever is modern and hip. that is actually disrespectful to the game and gamers. the point is to engage with an alternate reality.
i skip through cinematic cut scenes like crazy. they are a one time feast then after that just irritating to the gameplay. mature is mature. options are nice to have though.
urge to replay da o rising  rising....
dragon age origins was epic. i what a dragon age 2 worthy of the name dragon age. also no remasters or remakes  they will gut it and add in the woke. rather see dragon age just moves away from this whanna be mmo and do a rpg of old.
this is peak insanity
gaider has always been silly. don t worry about it. i appreciate you covering this  but gaider has always had quirky  ideas .
melonie mac go boom is awesome.  this is about storytelling  in a broad idea that the game companies need to consider in their projects.  one thing about storytelling is men are visual  and women need the fantasy  the intelligence of both men and women are comparable at adult maturity  their brains are wired differently to focus on different things.  if ea wants to attract women  they need a fantasy story.  the thing about fantasies  it isn t the lurid details of the life  where people don t want the personalized drama.  you never hear how gandalf the grey gets over cold   flu season  because that ruins the fantasy  unless it is part of a one-time story event  because we don t want to dwell upon downside reality too much  many  many story elements are one-time  to create the background  because to dwell on it is to bore the audience  and this creates the story bible that the audience latches onto  and some people obsess over  look at star trek  endless explanations from obsessive fans .  if you want a hot date  don t give too many details  because your woman is having a fantasy  and this is how they marry  women love surprises from strong men  pick a decent restaurant  and don t ask her where she wants to eat  only take her there and surprise her  so that she can fantasize  and then pay full price as a man.  if the woman wants to share the tab  she doesn t like you  the fantasy is over  and she wants a doggy bag to go  so that she can leave you.  moreover  strangers are normal  until you meet them  and then get to know them  and then they become unusual.  everybody you personally know is unusual  as their individual traits become known to you.  the reason being  you are projecting yourself into the world  until the individuals of the world become unique and different.  people are fascinating  because when you get to know them  they are different than you.  if you want your avatars  game characters  to have fantasies projected into them  you need the players to project themselves into the story  and you cannot have too many details to do that  look at the game metroid and the character samus aran  many young men latched onto 8-bit woman s bazoomas  before everybody had cell phones  and the game isn t about sexual values  as an action-adventure game  this is famous.  the more details  the smaller the audience that will accept it.  never explain what is behind magic and technology items  where they have game purposes and functions  and too many details ruins the illusion.  i remember playing the buck rogers game  a hundred years ago  and the game company didn t explain how a buck rogers space ship functioned  and neither how you can have a colony on mercury  as they left it up to the players  imaginations  and this created sales.  this was parodied by william shatner  of the star trek original story  in the comedy movie airplane ii  tragedy with a happy ending   where the moon-base had a strange technology device that the staff didn t know what it was for  as it flashed lights  the actors don t know what it is either.  if you explain how to have a colony on the moon  you failed the fantasy part  because people turned away for being too much science in the details  most people are not scientists.  in the fantasy  you need broad-brush stroke   bumper sticker moments for the women  and nothing too deep  because you break the fantasy by too many details.  like lara croft  don t make her a suffering victim in the feminist movement with lots of drama  because the men left her behind and the women don t have a fantasy  women also project themselves into other women as fantasies .  the best game cut-scenes are brief  they don t show too much  they reveal an interaction  or a motive  or something relevant to the story  and they don t get into details.  this is why street fighter could have a motion picture  because there are few details that outline the characters  and you use the movie to create box office entertainment of their lives.  if you introduce a game-play idea  this is a chekhov s gun  and you need to answer it  by example  look at the movie knives out  2019   that knife prop  it is a chekhov s gun  at the end of the movie  you see something of the storytelling.  the fantasy is also ruined by introducing irrelevant elements that go nowhere  there are always loose ends in the background story  and you don t want to focus upon these  because the audience turned away by being bored with failed fantasy expectations.  moreover  you need a macguffin.  what made star wars  1977  movie character r2d2 so popular is that he had the plans to destroy the death star  and this is a macguffin  where r2d2 ties the story elements together  while we adventure in a galaxy far far away and long long ago   people latched onto r2d2  because men need to solve problems  and r2d2 had the solution   the droid became an important tool to the male audience. men are visual  and you need the visual elements.  in addition  men are mission oriented  and they need to complete their problem solving missions.  men s brains are wired to solve problems.  if the game problems are too simple  they are leaving you with a bad reputation  because dur.  men love women  look at the popular computer game  hero wars   it is also about men seeking women  and there are puzzles to solve.  this creates dopamine responses in the brain  all games and storytelling are psychological  and solving difficulty creates the brain s feel-good reward  that is hollywood  they create the drama  and then solve it  people latch onto motion picture characters and actors this way  and comedy depends upon this for the happy ending  tragedy with a happy ending .  moreover  men have a limited mercy meter in the brain  it isn t unlimited  if you keep demanding mercy  it goes empty  and the man leaves you.  you need to reward men to keep the mercy meter from going empty  like lara croft s curves did.  there is an entire mod underground  so that we can reward ourselves with some fun  look at resident evil 3 and their mods.
so did melanie actually ever play any other games than tomb raider
i m not really sure what you are going on about. single-player story-driven games have been on a downward trend for close to 10 years or more.
thw thing is they don t need niche they need normie  .
@lingr icen  im saying they both do and dragon age origins has both and yet melonie uses thsg as an example of story not being important in video games  no o agree graphics dont matter but both gameplay and story do
did you not see the animation on netflix though  i don t trust anything dragon age going forward with a 10 foot pole. dragon age let you make your own choices  which the ability for the choice say to be a male going to the gay brothel is fair enough  but i don t trust anything going forward after that animation. that ability for choice is probably going to be used to push stuff into your face.
i m down for it. dao was the best one. 2 was meh and inquisition was... well let s just say it was crap in comparison and leave it at that
awesome video and nice mean face. lol
i d buy it unless they take the chance to make the woke-preachy like they did with the baldur s gate remasters.
hmmmmmm...... ea not being involved in any video game franchise would only be a good thing.
so we won t have to pay to unlock other lovers route  and morrigan won t be a dlc  oghren won t be replaced by a black female dwarf  didn t you felt that liliana was coded latina   lolno but seriously. dao is a masterpiece  it really don t need changes.  i would be fine with a remaster not a remake. clasic tomb raider from gog is a mess and prince of persia was hell to even set the controller.  i ended up getting a ps1 emu for tr.  i do have the original discs and have the gog copy.  but no way to run them.  ps1 emulator works flawlessly.  i ve considered getting them in steam to see if the steam controller thing works better.  as for cutscenes.  ugh  i know what you mean.  so many games now are pretty walking simulators.  where you are  guided  like 70  of the game.  and the 30  that you do play  characters won t stop with the hints of what to do.  like  shut up and let me figure it out! i m trying to explore here   it s like game devs learn nothing from navy.   hey! hello! listen! hey my problem with me is that i suck at shooters.  i had a small monitor 27  and my eyesight isn t stellar. so my aim suck. but i thought it was really good... until 3.... boy.....
no point even looking forward to the new da. we know it won t live up to origins after everything inquisition showed us.
i would only be interested if ea stayed out of it.  ea ruins everything.
i came back from afghanistan right after origins released. i saw it on the way back in the px but i didn t pick it up. i wanted to because i noticed the bioware name at the bottom and the back had  from the people that made mass effect .  i didn t want one more thing to carry back with me. but when i got back a few days later when my high school friend mentioned it and that was the only thing i did on my post deployment leave. i kicked my wife out so she had an excuse to go see her family and from 8 am to midnight everyday i played it. i must ve gotten the platinum within a week. then i bought it for 360 to 100  it again. it s my 2nd favorite game of all time behind final fantasy vii.
i mean possibly. but i ve also noticed they insert more and more gay story plots and characters in the games. by inquisition most main characters  side stories  and every other minor character was gay. example  the queens party mission.
for the love of god  can the palette be less brown this time around i almost couldn t play the game  everything was either one ugly shade of brown or another. which is a shame  because i loved it otherwise. the blight was brown   green  forests were brown  blood was brown  character armors were brown  orzammar was brown... ok i guess that makes sense. enchantment    yeah  you got anything to add a bit more blue and green and white to stuff    enchantment!   ok  nevermind then.
i really liked dao  but the thing that would cause me to hesitate in calling for a remake is that bioware has just gotten more and more woke over the years  and you know they d inject more of that stuff into it.
enchantment  enchantment!
you re talking about the people who added mastectomy scars as fashion items to their game. who have killed more franchises than most people can name. of course they d try their damnedest to ruin it.also.. yeh... dragon age is practical shipper age  can t really fault anyone for that one.
hi melonie what s your thoughts on red dead redemption 2 gameplay and story
lets face the facts... dragon age is kinda a lost artifact and it s great as is and well a dragon age rebooting is more feasible at this point. sorry  melonie but that s my opinion.
i want a remake remaster of this game so badly. dragon age 2 was trash and inquisition is still fairly new and doesn t need one.
dragon age origins awakening been awesome. but they lost it and ruined the sereies with da 2  going forward by changing the things the audience liked to appeal to a  modern audience .
would ea ruin it  just look at what they did to morrigan in dai  giving her a double-vasectomey to appease  name of angry activist . certainly  women should not be objectified  but they ve gone to the other extreme -- no attractive female romance options  unless they re gay and thus unavailable to men. i ve no reason to think that a remaster would not succumb to those same pressures in numerous ways.
melanie mac just in case you didn t know but backup368 is trying to call you out in a youtube video about tomb raider. just thought you should know incase it effects your fan base.
oh  and as for broken tome raider games.. was it.. legends  whichever one you start off a level base-jumping down a frozen mountain  and have to jump the motorcycle onto the train. that level would crash 999 999 out of 1 000 000 times
crpgs live and die by their story. so i don t think more story in games is the problem. but instead   poorly written and executed story that detracts from the experience instead of complimenting it.
i don t know  i thought all the dragon age games were good  there s a weird idea in gaming that any streamlining is  dumbing down  and that systems have to be as obtuse and unintuitive as possible to be  deep.  that being said i m sure they would ruin dao by taking it too far down easy street and making leliana a trigendered pyrofox and make alister transracial.
dragon age isn t realistic!
there s been good modern games  but they re mostly japanese and global indies. i just played remake   now playing remake   the games is certainly challenging and disgusting. metroid dread was an awesome game  japanese and spanish developed. bloodstained ritual of the night  hollow knight are amazing  but they were crowdfunded indie games. i d say hollow knight is thr best game of the 2010s.however  most american games of the 2010s  doom 2016 and doom eternal were awesome. honestly thr best from the west i can think of that s focused on gameplay  aaa american  it s doom.remake   remake   and the coming remake  are japanese capcom developed games  but those are among the best remakes. i d say legend of zelda link s awakening and metroid samus returns earns a spot on good remakes.
ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead  nor print or tattoo any marks upon you  i am the lord.
i d love a remaster but i know they would change things. even with its graphics and clunkyness origins is the best dragon age game. in a remake morrigan would be flatter than my bedroom wall  a character or 2 will be race swapped and a new non binary romance would be added. it just sounds awful. in a perfect world the story and characters would all remain true to the original nothing would be added or taken away for politics and i d buy the collectors edition.
i don t think dragon age capital n needs a remaster. if anything a remaster will only doom the franchise if it s a success  because then it will spawn woke sequels. dragon age s appeal was the origins  character loyalties quest lines and combat. the story itself is pretty basic  go kill a dragon and fight not-orcs.
a better idea is leave the game alone it runs fine on systems now adays and is perfect the way it is
never got into any da game.  tried a few times..always felt like a chore.  i kept thinking  everybody loves da...it s going to get better...i just never got there.  which one was it where you had to end a guy for no reason to progress the story   that s the only thing i remember from any of them.
given ea is kinda now a red flag i mean look at battlefront ii and there a r easucksass should tell you enough
the nfl generates more than twice the revenue of the nba.  according to game publishers  the nba is niche and should be changed into american football.
i m among the few who think that da i is by far the worst of the 3.da o is an amazing game and a remaster could be good  but if it s a remake then it ll probably be garbage.
hey melonie what s your favorite video game
dragon age origins is better than skyrim. and skyrim has been repackaged time and time again.
pleasing to the eye is technically female orientated due to vision differences
i am pretty sure me2 outsold dragon age origins by like 2 million copies.  mass effect 3 is still bioware s best selling game.
my secret hope is that da4 flops  so they sell the franchise to someone else who might know what the heck to do with it
you  hijack  every video to talk about tomb raider.
companies don t care about so called  gamers . companies care about how much money a game makes them. so just go look at the top money making games in history. then you will know what the top games were.
yes  it was a wonderful game but i have to agree the sex scenes were very cringe!
here is a novel approach make a new game with the quality of dragons age origins  i for one am sick of half  assed remasters
consume product get excited for next product
that game would need a remake not a remaster  like there is horses in that universe but we never saw a horse at any point. thats  very stupid
well the old games were better. ones like pong  space invaders  parsec.....ok i m old. but it s funny.and remember to drink water.
thanks
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! can we stop with the remakes and the remasters. make new shit!!!
i m not interested in da o if all the developer wants to do is enhance the sex scenes.  i won t buy games like that.
ms boom boom
todays gamerz are lazy. games should be looooong and intresting and no hand holding.
the woke just got destroyed
i hope not. ea ruined dragon age 2 and current bioware is more dead than lucasfilm
hey melonie  honestly i have no interest in dragon age yet im really waiting for dragon dogma 2 that  is hat i want.
...poor man s video-games...lazy man s engagement...
nnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! origins and awakenings were the good ones  redo the later two p.o.s. and leave dogmeat 2.0 alone!!!
idk i d rather have new great games then all these remakes. graphics really don t effect me all that much if the games good and runs which origins does both its fine. ik the modern game industry blows but all these remakes are not helping to me i ve been skipping alot of the remakes because i already played those games and they are the same just with better visuals. especially if we are talking a ps3 and 360 era game those titles just tend to hold up great in their original versions. we need new games and good ones the remakes are getting old.
the dead space remake was perfect so i don t see why ea would f it up
well that game will be nothing as good as the original. gotta cover up the skin on the females!
lol you say games are more story focoused.....i disagree.  i don t know what the hell their focous is on  but it is not quality of anything.
pathetic take on the whole story in games. wanting to have a story does not make you a casual gamer lmfaoo. plenty of games have amazibg storys with epic gameplay. this take was absolutely terrible.
gaming has been toned down  i love modern games and have been a gamer for my entire life. such a bad take today. i like a lot of what you have to say but this is a pretty big nope
i have not watched the video yet but heres my ignorant take. 50 50. people bash ea for their microtransactions but ea has published more good to great games than bad. in the last couples years theres been nfs heat unbound  star wars jedi fallen order squadrons  unravel 1 2  it takes two   a way out  and the most recent and also a remake  dead space remake . people have gotta stop taking the piss and actually form their own opinion and stop reading twitter. i dont care if a game company publishes trash  ill look at their next product with a fresh mind. there isnt  a single franchise or company out there that hasn t released shit. i choose to judge based on the actual fresh product and not on past mistakes or failures. but this is a world where people believe a 7 10 is average. 5 10 is average  7 10 is good. you want a product to be 7 10 or higher.
2 was my favorite but that doesnt mean its by no contest   i loved dragon age origins  3 was very bad  especially with how hand fisted the western dyke haircuts there were  there just wasnt any good haircuts  they literally had the miley cyrus haircut
how can this garbage game be  ruined
don t worry eventhough ea don t ruin dragon age  bioware will ruin it
lemme guess... you haven t played the game  yet here s your expert opinion about it
the original da was crap. buggy and woke af  insanely repetitive  with simple story lines  mediocre visuals and dialogue options.
mages and magic were a mistake
100 dragon age 2   3 does not feel like dragon age to me. dragon age 3 is an absolute nightmare to get through and is boring as hell. the characters are dull n the dialogue is so bloated. the combat is repetitive and slow. the quests are dirivitive  the bad guy is boring af. dragon age origins is a masterclass in writing  i remember everything from that game right down to the sideuests and it wasn t too bloated.
dragon age inquisition bored the hell out of me
