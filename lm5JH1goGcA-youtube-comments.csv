angelina was the perfect laura croft. embodied her perfectly
my condolences to all og tomb raider fans.
can t wait to see this be  updated for a modern audience  again
don t think we haven t noticed that lara has dropped multiple cup sizes with each successive movie installment and has yet to fight a dinosaur... and phoebe waller-bridge hates men and straight women. abandon all hope on this one.
the fact that phoebe waller bridge is writing this is the final nail in the coffin.
people want lara to explore the amazon not be controlled by amazon!smacks head on disbelief
do you think we will ever get the tomb raiding lara again  the adventure seeking lara  the fun lara  because i miss that lara
i think by this point it would be pretty safe to say that melonie is a big tomb raider fan
we just need a lara who s confident and badass.  who explores old stuff   solves puzzles and mysteries and booby traps. and finds cool stuff. we don t need social commentary and a bunch of other random characters being annoying
at this point it s obvious to say that amazon is intentionally destroying these beloved franchises! henry cavill and games workshop had better better be carful if they give amazon an ounce of control they will ruin warhammer 40k! great video melonie  as always.
melonie should have been given the rights to tomb raider. not only would she have respected franchise  she would have played a perfect lara croft! lol seriously though it s so damn sad to see our beloved characters torn to shreds by corporate greed.
melonie s worst nightmare came true
first episode s opening line s gonna be   larry always knew he was different from the other  boys ...
star wars  lotr  scooby doo and now tomb raider  it s like someone is going down a checklist of my fond childhood memories and destroying them.
melonie matching my feelings about marvel dc with her concern for tomb raider. i feel for you. it s even harder when everyone around you somehow enjoys the material and you re left feeling like you re on a regimen of crazy pills.
jolie s lara was following her father s footsteps  but they didn t take away her reckless and anti-hero personality. the fact that she saves the world when she finds the artefacts is just collateral damage. and her friendship with bryce and hillary is acceptable  since there are a lot of sarcastic humor in their interactions.
totally agree with everything you say about tomb raider. laura has gradually been altered into someone completely different than the original character. if its not broke then why try to fix it. the original two ps1 games were so good and so successful the legend was born. now laura is just a modern pc  politically correct  version of her former self. in fact one could say a shadow of tomb raider  see what i did there  .
i literally just saw this news and wondered when you d be making a video.
hey melonie  i love your passion for classic tomb raider. i am so appalled what has been done to my girl lara croft. she is one of my gaming idols and it is so sad knowing we may never see her in all her glory againi have always wanted to see a tomb raider x witchblade crossover game  or maybe a game where she meets indiana jones or nathan drake and they team up rival each other to reach a famous  ancient and powerful treasure artefact after tr anniversay i was pretty much done with the franchise since they would never remake the rest of the classics like 2  3  or last revelation  which is my favorite . secretly and quietly i still hope for a true revival of this kick ass female character
couldn t help myself  just had to see if you d released a vid about this news! she did a great job of helping to destroy james bond  looks likely to do the same with indi.. reckon lara s tv series character will be unbearable  probably the game too
agree!
they at least understood that lara is hot. thanks angilina!
i just watched those movies last week. couldn t agree more.
i wasn t even born yet when angelina played lara  but those movies are my favorite tomb raider related media. the 2000 s nostalgia is strong
@meloniemacgoboom   is ur stalker in jail
first game was and still is the best. movies could have been much better in my humble opinion.
i just never liked the direction of them movies they were to far removed from the original games...
to be honest  back when it came out i didn t think she was a good fit for the character at all. but i guess since her character has only gotten more shit over the years angelina s version just keeps looking better.
exactly
we can t catch a break
no one who has ever touched tomb raider in the 21st century has really cared about it. as someone who s first gaming experience was playing tr1 with my uncle  23 years of this crap has made me numb lol.

lara croft is my fav female character. tomb raider legend was my first ever pc game played and it made me fall in love with lara. please god don t ruin it
o it s coming   this madness has been going on for years.
who even is this  modern audience   like in my local gym  many gen z ers hate most new things coming out  so i don t think it is made for them  neither me as a millennial. so i am guessing only the few hipsters living on starbucks is the target audience
@themetalfreak360  it s obviously a vocal minority but the problem is that the vocal minority managed to hijack the levers of power and have a death grip on it
@themetalfreak360  exactly i m gen x and all the way up to today they can t say who the modern audience is. wtf
@thebosswolf5680  they have this crowd in their minds who only exist on far left college campuses but that crowd doesn t purchase movie tickets or pay for tv. they live 10 people to a studio apartment chipping in  2.63 a month for netflix while they eat microwave ramen in front of their dozen cats
i just wanted two sequels to the reboot film  with the whole trinity arc. i see them as what the nazi s are to indiana jones.
why wouldn t they just cast cammy luddington  reboot lara croft  in tomb raider
it ll be perfect when it fits a woman  whose actually a man  but identifies as a woman.
@davidhfranz   camilla luddington says shadow of the tomb raider may be her last time portraying lara croft   et interview  2018
this show should flop because this lady has an amazon deal for two series and she s renewing contract  probably. and she was involved as writer for  007 no time to die.  ew.
@redacted2275  that s too bad  especially since she s actually larger up top than the game version.
plus size  body positivity lara croft   5 7   450lbs.  raids the refridgerators of gourmet restaurants worldwide.
she s keto af and eats a tall stick of butter in a single bound
laura was originally a double d  according to a gaming magazine article back in the day with her official stats
i can t stop projectile vomiting
this also could be why they reshot the ending for indy 5. cause phoebe might not be able to continue as indy s replacement.
@agingerbeard  use the team america gif.
yea getting someone talented is a real crime i guess .
please tell me your lying lol
ok yeah it s done then.
as if she didn t already ruin indie.

who is she
@sinkiy  literally incorrect ivy valentine.her boobs actually got bigger which of course none of you would complain about even if they become the size of two small buildings lol.gamers stereotype themselves.
@chandllerburse737  oh shit didn t think about fighting games lol.  but i ve seen plenty of female characters become uglier and less sex appeal  desexualized  throughout the years. cortana was a victim of this too. it s just because western creators like to make women more masculine and eastern creators like to make women more feminine.
@chandllerburse737  i agree everything today has outrage and backlash it s ridiculous. i have yet to see something come out and there isn t backlash over it. we live in outrage culture and it s now being monetized. i don t think it s going anywhere anytime soon.
is haley atwell not playing lara
@sinkiy  both sides love to rage about everything.
yep like much of western entertainment seems to have a phobia of actually attractive women believe venustraphobia is the term
@chandllerburse737  would point out how many female characters new or old they often make overweight or much more masculine and how many characters who typically were given large breasts had them reduced  and breasts are part of feminine beauty while they don t necessarily have to be very big but as we are as a species most do at least appreciate them outside certain types
@dragonlordess1  ive not really seen any of that beyond less bigger boobs ive not seen women characters get masculine or overweight
@dragonlordess1  tifa is whined about and bitched about yet all they did was not give her the giant ridiculous pixel chest she had before but people still act like its the end of the world lol.
@dragonlordess1  ironic that people here complain oversexualization by liberals and how sex work is demeaning and i wonder how people here feel about skimpy clothes but you guys all lose your minds if lara croft isnt wearing short shorts.ridiculous i just dont see anything worth it in either sides arguments anymore and i dont see this issue of characters in games becoming fat curvy isnt fat by the way and lara was always curvy.smaller boobs sure but even then its what it is and muscles isnt necessarily masculine street fighter and mortal kombat women are hot but they are super muscular.i really have not seen what you people claim to have and maybe ive just missed it but wheres the characters becoming too manlike or too obese here
@dragonlordess1  we appreciate them as a preference some men dont care some men force it as a dumb beauty standard some women too.some men obsess with large boobs even really ugly giant ones that are painful to look at.as someone who unfortunately has met many men into porn and such its amazing how many are judgmental over a lack of super huge fake boobs.plenty arent sure still but its odd to see people who legit think its a sin to be smaller than a d.humans are superficial i guess thats the issue.hell i dont care i feel odd myself when i care about a womans boobs.its just oddly perversive but thats my own issue i guess.
i definitely do agree that many people both men and woman should be better at separating rl and fiction don t have much argument their but i also think people should be allowed their fantasy as well. i also have problem with some of the hypocrisy i ve seen where they change the appearance of females like tifa  but keep barret the same for example i don t really have issue with male characters being made to look like super fit semi body builder type bodies but i do take issue with the hypocrisy involved when they do change other characters in the same game like tifa to have less large chests or similar. also its rare but their are girls out their with bodies similar to some of those female characters have which i ve seen many of the bigger complainers and counter arguers against reducing preexisting large chested woman characters to be attacks on them by people who claim that such bodies are unrealistic or ridiculous
@chandllerburse737  actually ivy s boobs in 6 were reduced. they were also reduced in 5 as confirmed by the devs . so thank you next lmao.
@dominatrix1999  what guys i am not a liberal or a sjw
@dominatrix1999  good lord chill out bdsm profile
@dominatrix1999  you literally are trying to flip the tables on me when guess what  i don t care about that lol.she can have shorts or whatever pants it doesn t matter
@dominatrix1999  lord they are so huge anyways if they kept getting bigger jesus.
@dominatrix1999  i don t watch sports i play crash bandicoot.he was a better tomb raider anyways lol.
@normanreaddis  yea she ruined a movie that isn t even out yet lol.
@jells31  a wokie. basically a nobody.
@anthonycheesman33 this argument again  lmaohow many movie has it been that the  conspiracy theories  are correct. lucasfilms been a train wreck for years now. why am i explaining things to blind people is beyond me lol
@agingerbeard  and it got on my shoes .which is less gross than her
@normanreaddis  you haven t been correct you people blow up before a movie comes out end up being dead wrong and you just double down lol.
@anthonycheesman33  straw. man. we don t base it on just some trailer or the one actor. it s an amalgamation of all the marketing media  promotional angles  the track record of the writers and directors  dozens of metrics. forming an opinion based on that is absolutely rational  and has been proven right time and time again. doomcock s content is a prime example. feel free to stick around  even if your full of it  the engagement brings this to more eyes
@anthonycheesman33  as if we re not correct about the last jedi  solo  the rise of skywalker  national treasures series  terminator dark fate  so on and so fort. honestly the cope you have is very concerning  the hell are you doing here  unless you re a troll or a corporate shill.
@agingerbeard shhh... i m trolling the troll shill. it s my pass time while i m rendering my project in my office. lol
@normanreaddis  oh dang sorry to stomp on fun time
@anthonycheesman33  oh  i didn t mean to trigger your righteous woke-rage! oh please  have mercy on me! the shame is killing me
@patrickrobinsob1464  i was thinking there was a connection as well. after the test audience screenings went poorly and they had to redo the ending  phoebe s agent was like well you can take your ideas to the tomb raider franchise and do what you wanted to do with indiana jones.
@normanreaddis  have you seen his channel description  explains a lot  i feel bad tho  your bait was so good i didn t even know i was messing it up lmao
@faervel  it also may explain why we haven t heard anything else about the indy tv show.
waller is writing this!  hahahahahahahha... ohhh my god  i knew this was going to be bad  but wow  this is going to be the next velma!
@grobut81  you do know she s won awards right
@anthonycheesman33  you know tlou2 won awards right  like... all the damned awards  even the ones it could never be elligible for  right gee  it must have been good then! i m sure it wasen t even the slightest bit political at all..
@grobut81  if a singer wins grammys i m going to say they are talented and if a writer wins award it s safe to say they are talented. just because you don t like something doesn t mean we all gotta be hating ass bitches too you know . some of us like to be positive about things i know sorry .
my only concern if lara going to be sexi or not
@arielcleirigh  not at all. sadly
@arielcleirigh  look at guyladriel in rings of power. there s your answer.
i m more upset about the god of war series being amazon bought. they are gonna fuck that shit up royally.
@blacklivesorblackvotes2985  it makes me sad
haha  that s pretty good
@arielcleirigh  i wish.
me too brother
no. she s dead. i m sorry. from fans maybe  but won t be very good quality if anything is done at all.
she s been missing since she entered that black gate in 2003... but i hope
nope.  we never will.
i miss the old lara  straight to to the goal lara  chop up the foes lara.
i miss selfish tomb raiding grave robbing antiquity thief lara.
nope. we ll get a trans version before an accurate one. welcome to hollywood 2023.
i do too...i have been replaying the legend trilogy...it was what i grew up with... been having a blast
nah  she barely mentions lara croft and has tattoo of bayonetta on her arm.
it s amazon... place your bets now  frumpy black lesbian lara  or trans lesbian lara the side-shaved haircut and shoulders like a linebacker are a given either way  of course.
don t. don t make me sad  i have hope yet for warhammer 40k and henry c.
who  op  she can always audition if she wants it that much. doubt they will hand it over to a youtuber. i see your point but she would need to audition like everyone else.
i can see her with the role lol
@thisismyname723  i think op is saying that melonie should be owner of the ip. if she owned the ip i think it would be far more successful  and if she wanted to play lara she could  if she owned the ip. i agree that would have beennway better
lol  absolutely not.
this is why you shouldnt be a star wars fan.the only character worth seeking is vader as far i see and he died in the originals.sci fi nerds were never gonna make it.just a joke btw
yeah that  someone  is probably satan
ya some things need to just be left alone..oof
you forgot so many  terminator  indy  to name a few
i still have silent bomber to enjoy and metal gear
@creativewm_personal  metal gear was already kind of ruined by konami.
@chandllerburse737  we don t acknowledge that abomination wearing the skin of mgs5
@creativewm_personal  i meant pachinko and survive.i love mgs5 personally it just wasn t finished unless you mean survive.
@chandllerburse737  i was referring to survive and as for the pachinko stuff i totally forgot about that.
@chandllerburse737
@chandllerburse737  nope  bye
@cinqueqwerty  you re right! add two more boxes to the checklist.
you forgot indiana jones. they are making a new one with timetravel bs
ps1  i played them on pc  still have the original cds.
@repvoid  quite possibly  but although the huge advances in technology and money thrown at games since the originals  i still do  t fully understand why the change of character. it s like trying to reinvent the wheel.
i got my expectations low on tomb raider i guess asking for a good game it to much to ask for
rest in peace tomb raider. i am going to start playing  tomb raider  the last revelation  since it s the only game in the series that i haven t played.
it sucks when everything you can do is helplessly watch the franchise you love the most going down hill like that. melonie s expression at end of the video sums it up.
when you say you don t have high hopes with amazon producing the next game and show  i m guessing that s an understatement. my condolences to tr fans
oh this series is going to be so bad. hey melonie. congrats on the youtube play button.
what baffles me the most is that all the tomb raider media are suppose to be connected to one another from now on. the games  the movie  the cartoon  the comic and now this live action series... a mess is coming... and i am at best anxious... but at worst very scared.
when i saw people tweeting about this  i knew you couldn t resist making this video. first she kills the indy franchise  and now she s come for lara.  insert darth vader  nooooo!!!!  clip
seriously  i didn t think i would enjoy a gamer girls commentary more than most gamer guys. all your ideas well thought out  your criticisms are spot on. go mel!
however  if henry cavill is actually going to head up amazon s video game adaptation division  this might not be such a bad thing. if that is true. imagine if he could come in and say   this is classic lara croft as she is meant to be and that s final!  would be awesome
i still have the classic ps1 tomb raider 1 case and disc. it s a relic now  of the golden days of video gaming. when games started dipping their toes into the realm of 3d. this was the age of innovation  when each console generation broke new frontiers with monumental games like tomb raider. i miss those days so much.
melonie  i ve never played a tomb raider game  or seen a movie... but my heart breaks for you. i am so sorry that they ve got your favourite ip in their hands!
who else is excited that the daily videos are back
depends on how much control will amazon exercise. afaik  they did not interfere much in terminal list  and it is brilliant. reacher is also apparently pretty good.though admittedly  pwb s involvement is not encouraging whatsoever  and neither are the claims it is going to be a road trip story...also  i do admit i like lara s backstory from legends a lot more than the original one  because i actually do remember the story from that  despite my first tr was tr3 back the 90s
have you watched killing eve melonie   phoebe wrote the first and maybe second series it was fantastic  and as soon as she left it turned horrible. it s centred around a female assasin  and a british cop chasing her who develops an obsession and almost peculiar admiration for her. the best part of it  was the comedy  whilst being dramatic and having you on your toes with all the twists and turns within this high stakes cat and mouse chase between cop and serial killer. she wrote the killer as actually funny and in a weird way likeable. also fleabag was a hilarious irreverent comedy  and i hate woke stuff and her becoming the next indiana would be cringe  but i got no cringe from her writing. i don t know much about phoebe other than her shows  so i hope she has no sjw stuff going on  but the if the comedy and ballsyness of the female characters she writes is anything to go by  we could be in for something interesting if she writes a funny and ballsy lara right  which  considering everything lara related we received in the last 10  years is anything to go by  i expect to be dissapointed as the franchise leader s idea of lara is just not who she is  and it s the reason we all expect it to be crap!
i felt that the reboot was actually fine. changing her to be sort of following her father s footsteps worked as a college age lara s initial motivation. i would have had her father more science driven where lara discovers supernatural and larger-than-real aspects on her adventures driving her to want to ride that high again.i m even fine with her being a  protector of artifacts  if you make it fit with the character. if you have a reveal that she s kind of a protector-by-chance. she ll find artifacts and put them in museums. she ll find artifacts and put them in her collection because they shouldn t be in the wrong hands. but make it clear....the thrill of the adventure  the chase and the hunt for the artifact is what drives her  what she does with them afterwards is more of an afterthought when the adventure s over. i even liked jonah in rise of the tomb raider and thought having him more spiritual and lara less so could have made for an interesting dichotomy between the two as colleagues. i know it s a near forbidden comparison  but... think nate and sully s friendship with occasional antagonism-between-friends and apply that to jonah and lara with them having differing views on their entire operation. i felt it really could have worked  but they just dropped the ball on it. entirely.you can tweak lara  you can make her fit a new interpretation  you can make the wider commentary on grave robbing vs artifacts vs historical value. lara s an anti-hero  she doesn t have to be doing the right thing every time. in fact  having her be a morally gray character lets you keep the games interesting. maybe sometimes she sacrifices a relic for greater good  maybe sometimes she sells it to fund her next expedition  maybe sometimes she keeps it. having her make these decisions almost on a whim in the moment keeps you guessing because lara herself is after the adventure  not the artifact. you can honestly do all of it while still maintaining lara croft as a thrill seeking  adventure craving  adrenaline junkie who is married to the chase. you can still have all these new ideas with a lara who oozes sex appeal and is  rad  bad  and dangerous to know  without needing romance subplots or any other personality-altering aspects.but to successfully do this  you need creatives who want to honor the original lara.
saw this first on a couple other channels and was curious on your take. it was the first news i saw after i got off work today and seriously bummed me out. there s no need for a half-baked tv show. just put out a tomb raider game where we re exploring and collecting artifacts  and no more lara crying over how many bad guys she just mowed down or some modern moral assessment. she was never about that. she was out to fulfill her own desires  take that relic  raise a sexy eyebrow with two pistols smoking. it s so  so simple.
we re all gonna be living in amazon camps one day.
i heard this announcement earlier and immediately felt sad for our girl melonie. is nothing sacred
this is why i still have all my old lara croft cds and i play them once in a while
bffs adventures  my exact thought. it s safe to say classic lara is never coming back as we all know and that all good things come to an end. and yes angelina jolie perfectly embodied lara in the first movie.
have fun! the last revelation is my second favorite tr after tr3 and the last classic worthy tomb raider game in the series.
coming soon  amazon s rings of tomb
he s not. he s gonna be in control for warhammer 40k s adaptation only.
i actually enjoyed the rebooted games  but i don t have a lot of history with the franchise previously other than legends and anniversary  and the movies of course. it sounds like the new stuff is going to be awful if the rumors end up being true.
i expect fleabag to self-insert in this  even if she doesn t act  and make it what she thinks indy 5 should have been.  insert retching noises here.  i loved the original croft games because they were seriously fun.  i ve not seen any tr movies  though a friend of mine who is a big fan of tr enjoyed the jolie movie s .  i m not sure how many jolie did  but my friend loved the one s  she saw  going to the theater in her croft costume too each of the four or five times she saw it in the theater.
prepare for a  flat as a board  lara.melonie would be a better lara than who they prolly get lmao.
imma say something crazy  give fleabag a watch. at least check out the first couple episodes and see how you like it. i say this because phoebe waller-bridge s character actually has more in common with lara croft s sensibilities than people might realize on the surface...
personally i liked the 2013 reboot and looking forward to playing rise. not sure shadow is for me though and defo giving the next game a miss. i was too young to play the first three games at the time  so that s a factor.
i feel your pain.. as a gamer whos waited for blue protocol  anime mmo  for years.. finding out amazon get their mitts on its publishing has me very pissed.  they are incompetent and are all about censoring it for a  modem audience . thus will ruin it like they proved to us in lost ark.  they dont know what they doing  but they got the money to splash.
i hadn t played tomb raider in so long! i have such fond memories of being suuuper young playing the original few games at my first little kid gfs house  b4 i had a playstation   man those memories were amazing!   the moves were awesome too  i bought 2 of the most recent 3 games    picked back up not too long ago. they were great mini-open-ish world games that i really enjoyed! especially rise. i m deff hyped for another game   potentially a tv show  but these woke companies directors really scare me bc they can t seem to make anything great! they take established stuff   mangle it for a  modern audience  but then nobody wants it  i hop to god it s not straight garbage!  i do trust in crystal dynamics.. but amazon on the other hand  after the lotr debacle  why aren t there any good movie or gaming studio left  besides a small handful  it s like they only bankroll these  new  studios that literally can t paint by numbers w  established ips wtf is happening! ! where are the creative designers   production teams  wtffff is happening to our society  how do they not see it by now ! u haven t made anything great in years you woke fools  look in the mirror   learn to listen to fans already! y all ever heard peter jackson talk about lotr  it s like he actually believed in the source writing that made token the famed grandfather of fantasy! while some people think they can reinvent everything  better   but w  barely any success for the masses!
you completely nailed it with the thumbnail!
it s funny  i used to get excited when my favorite properties were being adapted for the big or small screen. now i get disappointed and terrified  and immediately have zero faith that it will be good.
just imagine if someone decided in ages past they would have went with an og game accurate tomb raider movie that starred rhona mitra.
i know she s not a well-known actress  but i could see zhaleh vossough do a good job in the role of laura croft.
they were planning a sequel to alicia vikander s 2018 movie  but scrapped it for this. bugger that  i really liked the 2018 movie  despite the fact i was the only one in the cinema watching it. obviously it wasn t perfect and certainly could have used some tweaking  but overall it was pretty good. i would have loved to see a second one.
i remember back around the early 2000s at the san diego comic-con there was a model there portraying lara and she was probably the most fit and beautiful woman i ve ever seen to this day. why can t they find someone like her to play lara in the movies
it s heartbreaking  really. back when i was a kid  my family offered me a ps1  with 3 games. monopoly  gex 3d  and tomb raider 2. the very first game i ve ever played on the 1st playstation was tomb raider 2.because of that  this franchise will always have a special place in my heart.after being disappointed by the ps2 era  legend on x360 was slightly better  my hopes were getting up for the future. but nooo  they came back with underworld....after that  they completely crushed tomb raider  and butchered lara s body  basically turning her into a dude for no reason   that reboot face they revealed that looks nothing like lara still fuels  and forever will fuel  my darkest nightmares   .as a result  i ve been boycotting this franchise since the release of the reboot. didn t watch the movie neither  and never will. this isn t lara  so there s no way i ll ever watch it.when square enix sold the franchise  at first i was super happy about it  it felt like good news. i was thinking   yes ! now that it is out of the awful hands of se  there s hope that the games will be made by a company who doesn t hate lara and doesn t hate tomb raider like se did   .but with everything we know now... oh boy... any hope is dead...as heartbreaking as it is  one of the franchise i grew up with  the one that was my very first experience on a playstation console  and one of the few franchises that i used to love the most  i find myself hopping for it to die and never come back. ever.if that s the price to pay to finally stop having to watch this franchise getting insulted and humiliated every time they release something new about it  well  i m willing to pay that price.i prefer that they make garbage by creating new ips that i give 0 fks about  like forspoken. they can make that as bad as they want  i don t care  i ll just ignore and boycott these new ips. but leave the great franchises from the past alone. let them rest peacefully in the past  instead of turning them into a giant pile a cow s diarrhea.tomb raider  saints row  last of us  resident evil  final fantasy   7 remake  and 8 remaster     mass effect   legendary edition     dead island  dead rising  warcraft 3 remaster  mafia remaster  gta trilogy remaster  dead or alive  and so many more... this needs to stop. these people need to stop ruining these games  and make new ips instead  if they hate these games so much.ever since the lollipop chainsaw remake was announced  i gotta say i m literally sheeting my pants about it. i know what yasuda said  but... in today s world  i don t believe anyone or anything anymore. until it comes out and we can see for ourselves  i won t believe anything that is being said. too many ips have been destroyed over the years  tomb raider being one of these hundreds concerned by this. as a result  i have no more faith or trust left in anyone anymore. like a great little guy once said   i expect nothing  and i m still let down   .
i would rather see it be buried than run into the ground over and over again  is how i feel these days about any older production.  companies can t make anything good  and know it  so they re just trying to bank off of name recognition.
i m 100  with you on tomb raider melmac!
they should get sofia pernas to play lara  and base it off classic lara. she s great in blood   treasure  there s certain shots where i just think  that s lara croft .
we ve already had the only tomb raider tv show the world needs. it was called relic hunter and it had tia carrera in her prime in it. i miss the turn of the century. back then even executives understood that  this character is famously hot  right  then we need someone hot to play her.
would you humor us with a cosplay of your own take on a classic lara croft  i reckon it s be like prehistoric planet vs jurassic world dominion.
first time hearing about this and immediately asked   how  how do you turn tomb raider into a tv series
or they make her black
@luket3452  and transgender.
@batman0  with a half shaved head
@luket3452  don t you dare joke about that cause it might just come true.
@patrickrobinsob1464  it s going to happen don t worry aka worry.
@luket3452   damn  she about to look more like me
@luket3452  that will be her love interest. bonus points if they make the love interest a trans woman.
@batman0  i m guessing you resemble the racebent jill valentine from the last crappy resident evil film
or they make her plus size...
@gokux75  apparently
@luket3452  the last re film at least felt like it knew its identity it just tried too hard to appeal to re1 and re2 fans with a limited budget and limited time.
@chandllerburse737  it didn t know shit about its identity otherwise jill and leon would ve been white
@luket3452  the director seemed very passionate who he casted doesnt really reflect that since lets not forget men in black is amazing but agent j was white in the comics.he screwed up the silent hill movie creator also is very passionate he wants to do good but he ended up dealing with issues and executive decisions that made the original film kind of bad.although the sequel was worse.he is making that new one that was announced based on 2.but re welcome to raccoon city still i feel tried to replicate the games something people criticized the lack of for the mila jovovich movies of which the actors were white sure but they weren dull as a nail and didn t feel like the characters either.
@chandllerburse737  you are aware that the casting call for jill leaked in 2019 and it specifically called for  an african american with mixed ancestry . the casting of her and leon was purely done for the sake of identity politics and woke virtue signaling. let s just stop pretending like that s not the case. the director didn t give a damn about the source material  he simply peppered in a few member berries to trick gullible fans. effectively putting cake frosting on a turd
@luket3452  does that have to be the fault of him  he doesnt always decide casting the silent hill director i think didnt even make the changes to the source himself the execs did.
@luket3452  well i mean its either that or the  my wife is so hot and awesome  movies by ws anderson.re hasn t had a good adaptation sure but good lord i am not gonna pretend there isnt bias coming from your or each side either here.the movie was plagued with trying to appeal to everyone and trying to copy the success of the remakes.its still more re to me than the anderson films is all.
@chandllerburse737  i have no love for the scummy woke execs either. i m glad that garbage film failed in the box office. that hack director didn t even try to convince them to cast people who looked like the source characters  in fact he went on a press tour bragging about deliberately not casting people who look like them because he thinks the reason anderson s films weren t well received was because the game characters were played by people who resembled them  that s the most absurd conclusion to draw. the game characters looking accurate were the only redeeming thing about anderson s films!in short  forced diversity and raceswapping is an idiotic practice that needs to die immediately!
@luket3452  i guess it didnt do well but i heard they wanted to try and do a sequel for whatever reason
@luket3452  anderson films didnt even have actors that looked like them either
@luket3452  yeah dude you and everyone else here on melonies channel repeats that all the time i dont really disagree.i just mean raceswap isnt always an awful act when the actor does well like will smith those two times or jeffrey wright as gordon but execs are stupid always.but i dont really care for anti sjws as much as i do for sjws anymore.
@chandllerburse737  compared to the mediocre diversity hires they put in this the anderson characters might as well have been lifted directly from the games  especially claire  ada  jill and wesker
@chandllerburse737  oh i d love to see them try and crap out a sequel just so i can roast marshmallows over the burning corpse of a film it ll be
@luket3452  nah lol they were wooden being white doesnt make them any better.dude jeffrey wright gordon may have been black but he was a far more accurate and better gordon than the white actor in the burton films who literally did nothing and had no relationship with batman beyond saying  thanks batman  and then he disappears.but for these films i kind of put them on the same level.
@luket3452  also i mean at least claire had some kind of starring role here when in anderson she was always a damsel for mila to rescue.its never perfect sure but its whatever.
@chandllerburse737  the anderson claire was significantly better portrayed than the karen wine mom claire we got in the new movie
@luket3452  i have no idea how she was better portrayed she did nothing literally nothing.mila did everythingclaire shoots wesker and thats all i remember with chris who also did nothing and didn t appear til the fourth movie.leon also appears for five seconds and looks like pewdiepie failably flirts with ada.ada and wesker were decently done to an extent i guess.neither is really ideal but mila suffers from an identity crisis while the new one suffers from an indecisiveness to decide which game to even focus on.
@luket3452  also karen wine mom  what your weird dude i dont even understand these takes. she was just the only character who really did much which was sort of the issue with leon.
@chandllerburse737  ali larter did much better with the table scraps she was given in anderson s film than what the new bland  monotonous claire did
@luket3452  okay dude whatever i just dont like andersons films as they are less resident evil and more i dont know underworld mixed with blade i guess.
@luket3452  ali larters was bland too lol i dont see what you saw dude.she did barely anything and her dialogue was very basic.they wasted her character on both if anything.the games are always preferable for claires sake.
@chandllerburse737  i never said i  liked  anderson s films  i said the game characters were better from an aesthetic standpoint and in some cases an acting standpoint than the woke trite we got in the reboot
@luket3452  like i said i dont see how they were better comparatively both were done poorly.i feel the only reason you think that way is because you can call the new one woke as people love to do same thing as just saying something is racist it feels like nowadays.i am just saying what i think is all i just admit i hate both sides of the argument.one feels too unlike resident evil the other feels too forced as resident evil that it feels unlike it.
@chandllerburse737  the newest film doesn t feel anything like resident evil what are you on about  it feels like one of those crappy asylum rip-offs except worse because as bad as those asylum films were they at least aren t woke propaganda like this was
@luket3452  it at least tries to identify itself.what is the endgame of this argument now
@luket3452  its budget was low and it had issues during production due to covid
@luket3452  its a fun enough popcorn flick about as much as milas movies too.black actors arent propaganda to me even if the stupid execs want it to be.it didnt swallow the films entire story and thats better than most but hey people look at the last of us part 2 as some kind of feminazi message when in my three playthroughs i saw barely any of that. but reading one current marvel comic will have you actually feel like a message was forced into you.then again resident evil already leans into anti capitalism to an extent and dead rising even more but thats fine how they do it.
@luket3452  and will smith also replaced two back in the so called glorious 2000s and 90s
@chandllerburse737  wokeness wasn t a thing back then. back then will smith s casting wasn t done to spite white people the way modern  woke  corporate mandated diversity does.
@luket3452  people argue that i mean sometimes it depends.but still i think it at least shows that even then it can work.i dont know why i even argued with you i guess because you kept replying i didnt even think highly of the film myself when i saw it to me its just a basic somewhat fun popcorn flick.
@luket3452  will they ever ask why will smith a black man played j a white blonde guy in comics  or robert neville who was a white suburban family man in i am legend lol.
@luket3452  and i told you people argue that this stuff has been around longer people say a lot of crap. they say they lives is a conservative movie as a wake up call against liberals yet carpenter said otherwise and the movie seems more about the rich elite than political parties.people pick their beliefs.also i was mostly making a joke.woke culture to you is a trend to melonie its the downfall of mankind.to some its a major threat to others its not even an issue.
have you seen synthetic man s video on forspoken  it s pretty funny.
i remember it! that show was so cheesy
congrats on your award !
well  all things must come to an end. sad to see tomb raider be pimped out like this  but some fates are simply tragic.
was laura living in a closet this entire time  what a twist on an entirely different topic  i tried making a sound cloud account recently. when it asked for my gender it offered a  custom  option. so i selected custom and stated that i identify as a flying spaghetti monster. i clicked  create account  and kept getting a  cannot create account at this time  message. i m thinking   ok  maybe the site is down.  i refreshed the page and entered the same information   cannot create account at this time . after the fourth attempt i got imaptient and changed my gender to male. i was logged in to my new account and was baffled.
as a lifelong star wars fan disappointed beyond what i thought was possible  i m here with you   it ll only get worse...until it  hopefully  gets better
i ve never played the old games  and that might be why  but i really enjoyed the new trilogy of games.
tomb raider is like a freshly grilled juicy burger with all the right fixings. when it was first made. now it s like you see it on the menu but when it comes to your table it s wrapped in a mcdonald s cheeseburger paper wrapper and it s 5 years old.
melonie  i m so sorry
i have no doubt this is going to be shite.  i always wanted a tomb raider 3 with angelina. it is too bad that it never happened. would have loved her movies to have been a trilogy.
after what they did to wheel of time  my all time favorite book series  i have serious doubts that they are even capable of a faithful  or even decent adaptation of anything.
i can only hope the fanart and revolt art will be great
as a wheel of time fan  i feel your pain...
lara croft goes on a road trip with her friends.   you re right amazon ruined lotr and they re going to ruin tomb raider now. it s a sad state of affairs.
hey melanie  how bout...you make a tomb raider show   you have the passion  the knowledge of the franchise  and the other stuff. i believe you can make a better adaptation and stop the cycle of trash.  dontstopbelieving
i m sorry for your loss. i vote that freckled them they from willow as the new tomb raider. she is such a badass.
i loved in cradle of life where she straight up killed the ex to save the world. that was hard core.
you seem like a passionate tomb raider fan. i like it.
at this point all i can hope for is a remaster of classic tr1-5.
i still want a movie with rhona mitra. she was an official model for crying out loud!
i actually enjoyed the rebooted tomb raider as a game too  but i know they ll fuck it up. i m just praying amazon don t fuck up 40k at this point  that would genuinely hurt a lot.edit  phoebe waller bridge is going to write it ! ! what the hell   i m so sorry mel.
at this point it looks like we need a funeral for the tomb raider franchise as we know it.
uncharted is better
sad how this has turned into isn t
i d watch that!! go for it melonie!!
i would pay her double any asking price for it just to put these other creators in their places.
@batman0  do you even have that money
i hated cradle of life and the whole ex bs but i love the pre-legend lara era
amazon fuck up the rings of power
we need joss whedon to write a tomb raider movie.
0 39 nahhhh soon as that tweet dropped melonie went  lmfao they done messed up  more content for meee
that passion around tomb raider cracks me up. companies eventually ruin every character. especially when the character is no longer controlled by its creator.
i remember getting banned from steam s tomb raider forum when the game released. i don t remember word for word  but i said something along the line of the game finally having amazing graphics and worse boobs.it was worth it
amezing voice
when tr came out i recall playing it for a bit but it never grabbed me. but your vid s have made me interested to revisit it.  which should i play for a true tr experience  the original
that look on your face in the thumbnail is the same look i had when i first heard amazon was going to be doing the wheel of time.  ya just knew it was gonna be ruined.
this show and the last 3 tomb raider games makes angel of darkness look like citizen kane
next thing you know lara s backstory would be that she used to be larry croft.
i ll giv em a chance. the expanse is great. the boys are great. not all hope is lost  d and let us be honest   can it really get worse for the tomb raider franchise
at least classic lara lives on with the tr level editing community.
amazon is 50 50 when it comes to quality but the people attached plays a big role
supposedly phoebe was brought in to  improve  the most recent james bond movie and make it better for a modern audience and women in a post  metoo world. that s pretty much all we need to know regarding what she could do for tr.
unsure as to why the response to this is negative  fleabag was amazing and phoebe can write some seriously witty lines  perfect for og lara.  i know it s hard to have faith in this franchise considering how bad it s been treated with the reboot  but this seems good . i m excited tbh
as for bringing tomb raider to the screen big or small they should go and look at the first game and do that or  something like that because that tells you all you need to know about lara creoft and her motivations.
is it really that difficult to let lara have dual pistols  hotpants and a buxom figure  also exploring  tombs  for the majority of a game would be nicer than endless waves of murder fodder.
lara liking girls is wild.
meloniemacgoboomi agreed with you on upcoming game by amazon  upcoming live acting tvshow by amazon  upcoming tvshow by netflix.
now you get to feel what we lotr fans felt...lets just say it involves a prolapse.
i think when tr 1  2   3 gets remaster that will help shape lara to the woman she use to be.
tr legend was great. from the recent ones i d say rise of tr or tr 2013 if u haven t played it yet
@serpderp9475  true tr experience and you name legend   tr2013 !
the original tr is actually one of my 3 favorite games of all time  but i acknowledge it might be too dated to enjoy today  so i suggest it s remake  tomb raider anniversary  as a good place to start. the irony is  it serves as the second chapter in what was a rebooted trilogy that started with tomb raider legend  so that s a good starting place as well.but if you do like playing old school games  the classics are the only ones that are truly what tr is all about   platforming  puzzles and exploration. be warned  they are not heavy on action or cinematics  so they may not jive with the cultural shifts of today.
@robchuk4136    @serp derp  thanks gents!
aod was just a terrible  buggy and rushed mess. probably the worst in the entire series. only lara s ingame model and some parts of the storyline were better imo.
because amazon ruined lord of the rings with woke  so people are expecting the same
contact me for your reward
contact me for your reward
who would have thought that a series called  tomb raider  was about someone pillaging tombs. the clues in the name guys it not hard. thank you melanie for pointing out they re stupidity. i just don t know what s going on with games these days.
i liked the last film. are you a fan of tia carera s relic hunter series
highest potential of phoebe writing producing is first 2 seasons of killing eve. jodie comer as lara
i won t be watching the series. but i m looking forward to your reviews if you do them for this.
me theorizes that she plans on recycling the scripts for her indiana jones show that she no longer getting. i think it was tom.
r.i.p tomb raider franchise
last time we saw og lara was in tr 6 she walked right into the darkness and we never saw her again ...
10 31 at this point  i agree. just leave the franchise alone and we ll keep playing the good ones like we have been for decades. i m so tired of seeing the title of the game  knowing it s not what i think it is.
might as well have hbo make tomb raider adaptation starring bella ramsay as lara croft lmao
another classic franchise bites the wokie   dust.  that sucks.  i m going to start voting with my wallet more and more. hogwarts legacy goty
u would make the perfect casting choice for lara croft
it s doa for me. i think writers who have distain for the characters and want to shape lara in their world view will never be able to come from a fans perspective. they just want another ip to viacle their politics or messaging. i m just gunna enjoy it flopping  which is a shame cus lara was my childhood
i just really hope they wont give her the  galadriel treatment  ...
remember back on the ps1 when tomb raider was about lara croft  an adventuring woman who did over the top action stuff like killing a t rex and finding ancient treasure  sometimes i wish i had a time machine to go back to my childhood in the 90s lol. everything encompassing video games that i am passionate about is being crushed by people who haven t played a game in their life. -__-
damn i agree so much with you
between this and bayonetta being gone might hafta join ironage and put the call out a new badass female adventurer
the f ck is going on with amazon... i myself have already had a mixed feeling with the reboot games and their choice to  follow father s footsteps  but now we ve really got the worst of it by getting a sh tty tv series ! it s going to be so embarrassing omfg no why
i hope they don t mess it up for god of war
does this mean that the animated netflix series starring hayley atwell isn t happening anymore  as it is  atwell should have played lara croft in live action instead of alicia vikander  but it is  was   at least a step in the right direction for netflix to cast her in their animated show.
i m sorry  melanie. i remember how i felt when supergirl became about all the side characters  sexualities and not about plot anymore. supergirl is my favourite of all time  and i enjoyed the first couple of years.
they are given literally every franchise to spoilt people born 1991-2001
ya know i was thinking maybe this isn t so bad. then you mentioned phoebe waller bridge. now i have no hope.
wow  this has gotten crazy fast!
as a biracial gay closeted teen boy in the 90s i remember the first time i picked up the tr1 game from the local video store. lara helped me get through those hard years  i loved everything about her just as she was. it was more than just a game. now i m gonna be expected to get behind some woke race gender body positivity bullshit. this is devastating news.
just weighing in  she can write funny and i am glad she is not performing. i am neutral on this news. amazon is recycling a story and she will lend a fun spin. they could make her the heroine that they missed in the rings of power series with the female protagonist.i honestly think if they choose the right writers and a decent performer it will be pretty good. they could pull actors from the original bridgerton and do pretty well.
they did good with  reacher    the jack ryan series.  have hope.  for now
makes angel of darkness look good!
fleabag is good. is this the hayley atwell show or is that on netflix
what an adorable little fluffy pupper you have there!
tifa despite the addition of a black sportsbra  which i like  still has her 3ds.
it s going to be lit
i ve never played a tomb raider game before  and i ve thought about getting the one from 2018.  was it a bad game   it has great reviews on steam
the inversion and desecration of everything we have loved and appreciated in original aspects will continue to keep happening in the current society we live in with big companies being run by people of majority of them are politically leaning in one direction and who are just plain out activist who are motivated by incorporating their personal beliefs  moral compasses of ideologies into recreating what use to be original and distinct iconic characters  movies  comics  etc  to specifically align with their personal motivations and not the best interests of the fans so the point where these  original icons are quite literally unrecognizable and it s  sickening because they have the power to do so and do not care what anyone else thinks.
i m currently watching hunters on amazon. infinitely better than rings of power and this new tomb raider show. i highly recommend it.
they re fundamentally changing the character so much that they might as well make a new character cough velma  cough .
thank you for your reply on twitter.   i am not sure how i missed this video.
laura croft used to be what nathan drake was made to be and stayed. i loved the original tomb raider  even really liked the new games. however  while i understand innovation needs to happen  it s possible to retain what made something great while pushing it forward for a new era. and that is a mark that is very commonly missed by so many studios  gaming and video alike. i m still waiting for some rich person who is passionate to be like  ya know what  i ll do it myself!  and make a fantastic game just to stick it to the big corps who want to change everything about a beloved franchise.
wow! you really are hardcore tomb raider super fan melonie!!!
i m sure raider of power will be great.
someone should get you to play laraand ffs  why can t they do one that s actually based on one of the games  josh holloway as lawson and sharon stone as natla would get my attention for sure!
great video
and they completely ruined wheel of time.
@davidhfranz  and ring of power
@clarkkent6927  that s different.  they added things that weren t there.  wheel of time completely craps on the source material.
@davidhfranz  along with lotr.  so their track record isn t good with big series.  but it s better with smaller series.  the one red flag so far is phoebe waller bridge.  also all the people running this are  ex  something  like this series was a punishment for them.
the rebooted games are fun but they are not actual tomb raider experience. if you want a true tr experience  go to the classics and start with tr1
@meloniemacgoboom  ok  thanks for the advice. great videos btw
@meloniemacgoboom  they are more uncharted than tomb raider that s my problem with them. also the fact that laura actually says  i hate tombs.
all good  thank you for watching!
while melonie is beautiful  she s not quite voluptuous enough to play lara.
the question is...will it be lara jones or indiana croft   that belongs in a museum!
not everything amazon touches is bad. the boys  reacher  jack ryan  handmaid s tale  man in the high castle are all good. it depends on the team that runs the show.  i will reserve judgement until i see it. hopefully it won t be like the old show relic hunter.
why they would give a project like this to phoebe waller-bridge is beyond me.
amazon is eliminating free shipping for groceries. it will now cost  6 to  10 per delivery. amazon
rhona mitra was the original lara croft and arguably the best but i do agree angelina jolie s film was just good fun and compared to now its oscar material
at this point  our best chances of a new good tomb raider is some indie game starring legally-not-lara-croft
i feel like hellblade is one of the last high-fidelity games with a compelling and strong female protagonist. every other female lead you see in modern games and remakes just breaks down constantly  is poorly written  or betrays their own motives and beliefs at the drop of a hat. laura used to be the top of the pile for that kind of character-driven gameplay and it s a betrayal what s been done with her just because she was desirable to men.
you know what s disgusting  in every title of all articles that i read while searching the words  tomb raider  the name  phoebe waller-bridge  is mentioned with the same level of importance as the news itself.the level of smugness is sickening. even in articles from where i live  translated articles  this happens. in fact   articles  myass because it s a press release published as article.
there is also going to be a twisted metal tv series on peacock.
i know you love tomb raider  i see the ink! i hope the show doesn t ruin the universe for you like the halo show did for me. god bless you and enjoy your day please.
oh my. lara would theoretically be a great character for a tv show. can t wait to see how amazon destroys her.
you should be the next lara croft!
the original tomb raider was why i bought a ps1. they have really lost what made her so great!
i just don t trust amazon with anything at this point. especially lara  good point about them wanting to have the show and game match up though. hadn t thought about that. doa.
i don t know what phoebe waller-bridge knows about tomb raider  but she was involved in the writing and production of both fleabag and killing eve  for which she won a truckload of awards   so that s two good reasons to be excited about the new tomb raider.
i did like the 2000s tomb raider games never got to finish them aside from legend  never played the original ones and did played the 2013 and shadow of the tomb raider and i like them but i understand it s not your lara croft you like melonie haven t seen the tomb raider movies yet. idk what to expect form the series i don t think it ll do well but who knows.
i am old enough to remember the huge backlash in the 90s when angelina jolie was announced as playing lara croft in the movies... an american playing a posh english girl! ! !but... angelina knocked it out of the park!... she was excellent and totally understood the character.. and ofc angelina can act!!!im worried all over again
why the hell did embracer buy crystal dynamics in the first place if this was their plan  dump tomb raider at amazon
also i think allison carroll would have been a perfect laura croft but i think she only played the body double.
lol so whose name will lara scream more at the top of her lungs a  saaaaaaaaaaam! b  joooooooonaaaaaaaaaah! c  all of the above
are these shows on hulu
@clarkkent6927  no idea. no hulu in my country.  they are all on amazon prime where i live.
at least she knows how to write  diferent to the people who did rings of power
@elidasilva5558  fair point. doesn t automatically mean that s a good thing though. i don t see how she s in any way qualified to write an adventure story like this based on an existing and beloved franchise.
there hasn t even been a twisted metal game for over 10 years and they think it ll be successful  lol
@westridgemattlyman  why is samoa joe from t.n.a. and wwe playing sweet tooth why not get kane his name is needles kane
i d much rather have a new game the last one left a lot to be desired.
the games have already ruined the tomb raider universe for me as of 2006  and even moreso in recent years. i just go to the classics to get my fix now
@meloniemacgoboom      well here s hoping for a better future and fans start getting what they want again.
amazon did ruin lords of the rings
not to be mean but now you will experience true horror like we did with the lord of the rings show. godd luck out there
i am waiting for this show to come out and them not knowing anything about lara  and them getting her into romantic relationships even though she never wanted one in the games. she was married to her work and the discovery of tombs. hell it is woke big tech watch them make her a lesbian and give her a girlfriend.
as someone who s been a fan of lara croft since the  90s  the current tomb raider games  which i didn t hate  btw  don t seem as bad right now  do they
this is a no no for tr fans but its gonna be great content dudemelonie show reviews when
rip tomb raider
i actually really liked the...i think it was 2013 reboot version of laura in that tomb raider game. she was beautiful  a newb at the treasure  thrill seeker stuff. she got hurt a lot  she really wasn t a  marry sue . i think the following installments  after that game specifically  started becoming very bland and more feminist driven.
i can hardly wait to see amazon sell lara croft game lady dolls
i dearly miss classic lara but reboot lara s games are fun and i did like them but if she were to die i wouldn t mind tbh. hopefully classic duel wielding pistols lara can make a return
i m not a fan of tomb raider but i see a thing  more the franchises will be ruined  more hollywood is likely to fall to the bankruptcy.this is the same for streaming platforms.
i can t even tell the difference between new tomb raider game s and farcry game s now.
amazon is making it  and it s animated 70 to 1 odds that within the first 3 episodes  lara fights to save and  preserve  a  100  fictional   ancient artifact affirming trans ideaology .
i was like  ah come one  this can t be this ba-phoebe waller bridge set to writeyep  it s doa
i was excited for a fallout tv show then i saw what they did with lotr and now i don t want them to make a fallout show.
tomb raider will always have a special place in my heart but after the originals on ps1 it s been totally downhill since. movies  games doesn t matter they ve all been sub par at best. unless we go back to the heart of tomb raider  it will never work.edit   as above so below  is a found footage horror film that i think is the only thing close to the tomb raider lara croft i know lol though it has no connection.
let s wait until there s a trailer before judging.. they may actually not fuck it up!
i know you love lara so my condolences
my grandma looooved angelina so much  she said she thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. i mean  she s not unattractive or a bad actor by any means but i think i m more of a kate beckinsale olivia wilde kind of guy
the only thing left is for amazon to start making or remaking star wars movies and alien. we live in a dystopian reality.
they wont be happy until everything is ruined and when nothing is left what then. they will be more concerned with just doing it rather than doing it right. i don t see how it s sustainable  i don t have the numbers but still.
why don t we just start a crowd fund for a completely new game  romb taider with protagonist cara loft  if you make it like the real tomb raider it should be different enough from the modern garbage to not infringe on copyright  mainly because they ve changed it so much from the original
i m a lotr fan too  and already have witnessed tomb raider run to the ground for a long time. this isn t my first rodeo lol
angelina jolie  kate beckinsale  lucy liu  and jung ho-yeon are the most beautiful women in the world imo haha
@meloniemacgoboom  absolutely! like how people even look like that  talk about blessed lol
this is me anticipating the fallout show. my husband was so disappointed with halo  especially when master chief essentially self deleted at the end for no reason. i can only hope they won t touch new vegas. there s no hope any of these shows will be good.
you are insane picky with tomb raider. which is great. love it. i still loved the trilogy.. realistic lara is more appealing to me.
hollywood is invading the gaming market in full force now
the trilogy after the ps1 era are the best version of lara imo
i m afraid they will put melissa mccarthy as lara.
ive fallen in love with melonie mac s voice
fleebag is running tomb raider   rip tomb raider
i also think it s better to put a franchise out to pasture than run it into the ground.
i m scared. a part of me is happy  but a major part of me is seriously scared.this is gonna be....shit.
i can picture the pilot  lara praises velma and boycotts hogwarts legacy.
thank you for notifying me of this up and coming trainwreck. i shall promptly add it to my mental ignore-list. have a good day.
toshiro hitsugaya once said what do you say we have some fun
waller-bridge is just another example of studios drinking the kool-aid. they find a writer director who has a gimmick angle and uses that to put bums on seats. the studios then hail this person as the new messiah  or close to it   and proceed to give everything to this person  regardless of whether they re a good fit for each ip or not. eg  the new dumb and dumber have no real idea about tolkien...jarjar abrams is maybe the biggest example of this  but let s go back waller-bridge. she writes and stars in a comedy-drama about to a free-spirited but angry and confused young woman in london. and somehow that makes her the right person for epic-action adventure  indiana jones   or...female action-adventure  tomb raider! . jeeze  you d think that getting kicked off indie would tell amazon something about her wouldn t you  !!
i haven t watched tv for around ten years or more. only a very few shows at most in this time. tv is dead. i am afraid even my favorit hobby computer gams are close to this sens the in game shops took over.
perfect for audiences that can t handle nuanced  morally-grey characters that look good. an audience that doesn t even spend money on these things! xd
how can you not like the new tomb raider games  they were much better than the original. the combat is what made the game stellar
ooh  i got that same chair. i got the red one  d
wish they d remake the old games with the lara from the new trilogy
sorry about that  melonie. i know you re a big lara croft fan. phoebe waller-bridge  of all people!
what have you got against phoebe waller-bridge  she did win an emmy and is a very accomplished screen writer. is it cos she s  british    ahem  like lara croft.i m looking forward to it myself  as long as she holds back on the smuttiness she s famous for.
as a tolkien fan i am going to tell you what wheel of time fans told me  i am really sorry for you.
i bet its gonna be like national treasures remake series. just a shit show. but yes angelina was perfect as lara and as you said alicia did a good job. i saw ryan s vid before watching yours and he said something like   poor melonie .. so i had to come and see what your take was  d
tomb raider  the message!
i would be okay with emily blunt as lara croft.. doesn t she have the posh british accent on deck too  she proved to me she could sell the action hero type with edge of tomorrow   sicario too i guess  then again  that was almost 10 years ago..
i really hope they dont screw tomb raider up  but they probably will
i m so sorry for your favorite franchise  mel.
dear melonie  i just looked at some footage of powerwash simulator  and it says that lara croft will raise a fundraiser  in the maze  for artifact repatriation.... which means   the return of cultural items or individuals that were removed from their homeland the leaks are true and here is the proof. lara croft is now a protector of artifacts. so tomb raider should be called tomb protector from now on.
mostly i just feel lara deserves much better
if they re going to make a tomb raider tv series... why did they not hire @lana_lux for lara croft  that s as close as they re going to get to angelina jolie  to begin with. if you think i m joking... drop in on her twitch stream some morning local time...
all melanie had to do was put on a couple pounds of muscle and the producers for the show would ve been all over her dms.
you want the really bad news  embracer who own tomb raider and did the deal with amazon also owns the full remaining hobbit and lotr rights. this could be the start of a longer nightmare....
i m excited for it.   let them trash another tv series or movie.   this is unsustainable  and there is a breaking point in the future.   let them do their thing.  the ip will rebound just fine if eg releases proper tomb raider games.   all this stuff here does  is make more people avoid amazon garbage going forward.mel  cute as always.
will it be down to the ground   or will it rise
let s face it  whatever it is  it s gonna be  gritty and  real  . but unfortunately if lara doesn t dual wield guns and pistol whip dinosaurs  what s even the point   p
alicia worked her ass off. she had jason statham muscles.
every time i see a new tomb raider update  i already know melonie mac go boom is gonna be trashing it lmao for good reason - i hope for the best but obviously expect the worst.
just rewatch  relic hunter  and forget everything about amazon and fleabag.easier for everyone.
maybe we can just take a few years off of making tv shows and movies. let everything just reset a little.
hollyweird is handing japan their entire market on a platinum platter coated in goldanime and manga would be laughing but they re drowning in too much money
ok so my studio is on the second floor  and i can prance around in my nike sandels but probably no jumping jacks type stuff here  and yes the brochure does show a gym which ive seen last i lived here it is in this cloaked office where no one from headquarters exist in anymore...
also  id like to see a version of lara played by arienne mandi  https   www.youtube.com watch v tw2-sq9vfby t 1s
they won t surprise. fleabag is writing
i hear the next movie will be staring the rock in drag as lara croft
sorry for the loss  from a tolkien fan
weird the tomb raider would wanna become a museum curator
so you sound like laura croft grew up listening to cyndi lauper - girls just want to have fun.at the same time it sounds like sometime in the past laura croft was attacked and replaced by invasion of the woke body snatchers.so would you rather laura croft be a female james bond indiana jones tomb robbing mercenary or woke barbie antiquities professor.
oh god  amazon did it again.
i m like you  melanie  no hopes for this one  as a gamer who played the original and the reboots  toby gard is hating his character for what square enix envisioned her to be   a frightened child. back in the days of toby gard where he worked for core design and designed the polygons for her are the best games  ever. she was fearless  good looking  back in the playstation 1 windows 95 days  now with hollywood who got their hands on her back in 2001  the first movie in the lara croft tomb raider films were okay  not the best  but  just okay. i have no hope for this show  we have a velma situation on our hands. also  hollywood keep away from video games  like 70 000 galaxies away.
i haven t had pr me vid 0 on my phone since their lotr fan-fic came out. and this next offense against lara isn t surprising  but it s also beyond inexcusable. the men of the west in ithilien will not forget this.
my condolences.
yikes!.. there is no hope  i m excited for end of this franchise.
whats with poisoning the gaming media recently.hopefully mario movie turns out great btw.
melonie  you can only hope that their tr is more jack ryan and less rings of power!!!
off topic  but i was casually listening in the shower and a water drop hit the screen i guess and zoomed in on youre sleeve. never realized how detailed it is.
script leaks from phoebe waller-bridge s take on lara croft have already hit the internet episode 1  lara discovers an antique which proves men are bad and women are goodepisode 2  goons from undercover organization  the patriarchy  try to stop laraepisode 3  a group of lesbian wiccans task lara with retrieving an artifact which removes toxic masculinityepisdoe 4  just a compilation of ted talks with feminists screaming at men for causing all their problems  ever
i like laura because she overcame adversity to become strong  not because she s strong because she s a woman.this is why i enjoyed tomb raider more than wonder woman.
tomb raider rings of power!
black lesbian or trans lara croft sounds very brave  creative and original... and every interview will be not about the love for the game to make the show but about representation and representation and representation
don t have much hope for amazon s tr series
i hope this gets canceled or gets a new writer  keeping my expectations low
as much as i hate amazion for lotr rop  i can t judge something before i see it. we don t even have a single screenplay  let s keep the hopes low but also an open mind. it would be counter-productive to shut this down even beforeit starts. she did wrote some good screenplay including the last james bond  so it does give her experience for that and she can pick projects she really wants to do now since her reputation is already well established. and for the    not a protector of artifact    argument. let me remind you that fictional characters can change and evolve according to the author ideas. let s take jesus for example  he wasn t the type of guy advocating for citizen to own assault rifles at home .lara is much more sympathic as a real archeologist who behave like a real one.
i d rather make a new one with a better character. maybe do the start from the beginning correct for a character like what she represented by so many.
i mean i m going to watch it to see how it goes i liked the 2018 reboot movie even though i grew up with the original two movies and games and loved those. i just hope it won t be a woke mess and it is actually good like the last of us tv show on hbo.
phoebe waller-bridge is a fantastic writer    fleabag is a great british comedy show and she did killing eve a spy thriller which is bloody fantastic also. she does a lot of acting however she only writes for something when she knows she can add something honestly shes a writer who is kinda new to the scene  i can see the worry with amazon  however they do have other really good shows under their name.
i m actually optimistic . i can t wait! also it s not amazon s fault the rings of power was disappointing for a lot of fans! it s the show runner s fault. i mean for example  game of thrones s08 was trash  but hbo wasn t the one to really blame  it was the show runners. now just look at how asome house of the dragons is  that s because there s new show runners involved. y all get my logic  the company s are usually just paying the millions for the project and hoping for the best. just watch the terminal list made by amazon  it s and asome series  94  audience score on rotten tomatoes and the critics aren t fans of it. i ll never understand why. i m just saying it doesn t hurt to be optimistic.
it could be good but it s amazon we re working with so not a high expectation or hope
why do they never hire the best people for the job any more  i guarantee you phoebe waller-bridge has not been a childhood classic tomb raider gamer - most likely the complete opposite.
once they finally destroy the last strong female character and turn lara into a spineless undefined being i think i will give up on my life as a game developer and go into the wild to live with animals... like the great grizzly adams did  only he did it for different reasons obviously. particular set of skills i spent developing my whole life will help me survive roughly for... 45 minutes. but those 45 minutes will be good 45 minutes compared to the alternative.
this is not going to end well. i already have negative interest. and tomb raider itself has been subjected to bad treatment even before the reboot trilogy. remember that the horrible state of angel of darkness stemmed from burned out developers and a rushed production because the publisher just had to milk that cash cow and force sequels until it was dry. poor lara deserves better than this.
i am going to sum this show up nicely with just a few words  dead on arrival.
melonie  could you speak for yourself please  amazon didn t ruin lotr. i love their show and i am fan of tolkien s books. i ve always dreamed about tv show with lara and about one big canon universe. and guess what  i will finally get that abd i m super happy about it    i respect you melonie but i really don t like your recent videos. there is only criticism  criticism and criticism... it s really boring. in the past you were so positive girl and now i feel you are some different  very sad girl. please give sometimes a chance for these new ideas.
the boys and invincible but then rings of power  amazon needs balance tomb raider will provide that
wow...fresh off destroying indiana jones  they re bringing in the poobs wallbanger to finish killing lara croft.  what bad news for a friday.
her style of writing is not suited for  a tomb raider story imo  can imagine it will be very woke  considering it is on amazon . but in all honesty this could be miles worse and pwb could may indeed surprise us.
waller-bridge is allegedly getting written out of replacing indiana jones  so this will be her revenge.
let me tell you now  unless she loved playing classic tomb raider as a kid  which i strongly doubt  phoebe is an absolute horrible choice for this.
yes! the perfect writer choice for a series that was extremely popular with hormonal male teens. specifically  myself at age 14. also just a dope game series in general. you hired the feminist who gets acting gigs for operating in her woke writing positions. nice one  guys! sure this will go far  just like velma did. eesh... angelina jolie came the closest to a film live-action representation of the character. but  with where they went with the games  and amazon s writing in general... there are at least a few coffin nails in the equation. we all know this will be a woke reinterpretation that will be  groundbreaking  in  representation . and since women are lower on the oppression hierarchy now  i wouldn t be surprised if the series was titled  lara croft  tombraiding transwoman of color .
to me  at least  it seems that lara croft s early characterisation would ve be perfect for modern feminists - she was an intelligent  headstrong career-driven woman who didn t need no man  after all. but i guess because she was  upheld the male gaze  or whatever  that just doesn t work out  huh
yet another franchise obliterated.i don t understand why they re taking over already established franchises  instead of coming up with their own ip s.creativity and originality is becoming more and more rare.
i liked the last tr movie can t remember the actress name but it was great. what happened to that
recently played the last two games and replayed the first of that trilogy. the best one is the middle one. but yes they strayed from where they planned to go. it s dead. this new crap is doa
oh no sea biscuits back after her sudden kidnapping in  indiana 5 the woke death
i think  she will kill it. in the negative way
i got a bad feeling about this
good day and happy magical saturday. remember that you re god s masterpiece   a tremendous gift upon the world. everyday that he blesses you with is another day that the world and people as a whole will be fortunate because of the aura of light excitement and enthusiasm you bring forth. have a sensational day  a wonderful weekend and  continuebeingoutstanding
bring back the dinos !
i bet amber heard is gona star in the movie
amazon is out to piss you off. lol
this sucks. they really just need to make a 1 for 1 adaptation movie for the og trilogy. just find a nobody that resembles her and pay her to slay on screen. then make a legit tomb raiding platformer with acrobatics mechanics to follow up. that would be enough.
oh boy  cant say we r shocked at hearing this...  mel will b crying herself 2sleep 2night lol
amazon already woke-ified lord of the ring. if the game is as ufamaed as they say it is  then i don t like tomb raider s chances of its tv adaptation in being even decent...
oh man this gonna be great  i love tomb raider. i hope the first scene starts with her lesbian backstory and kissing another girl
i am not excited about this in the least. nor the anime with netflix. the best thing to come out of the franchise in over a decade has been the cookbook. xd in all seriousness though  that s pathetic.
phoebe waller-bridge couldn t kill indy so she moved over to tomb raider.  i ll give her credit she s determined to ruin a franchise no matter what it takes  now that s true dedication. lmfao
i m shocked to hear you say you think your done with tomb raider. the only games sticking to originality anymore is nintendo. the zelda franchise don t seem like it s changing anytime soon.
as someone who grew up with tomb raider when the games first came  i already disliked the 2013 game. i see no hope with the franchise  because the producers would rather insert new  current  stuff into the character  lore and games  instead of staying true to its roots and respecting the original vision.
meloniemacgoboomi disagreed with you on 1th reboot trilogy  legends  and 2th reboot trilogy  survival
tomb raider underworld was the last good tomb raider. no amazon tv show that uses an established ip is ever worth watching.
i am more sad it s amazon that s making the god of war series. sigh  the race and gender swaps awaits us.
this is the same way i felt about dragon age  i prefer it to be canned and never touched again. now i dont give a fuck. i good not giving a fuck  feels great
oh great  something new that i won t be watching or have any remote interest in.  hopefully amazon loses a ton of cash on this.
i would just love to see anything that resembles the og ps1 trilogy in cinema. the aj movies came close  but the fantastical elements fell a little short for me.
amazon is where franchises go to die.  they tie with disney on that.
it might never come out  since phoebe waller bridge is connected to everything.
i like your commenting a lot! i agree with you on a lot of vieuws  but please  don t be so extremly negative before you know any facs en how the game serie will looks... eventually they get it right.. just be patient en talk about it constructive.. pre-reviewing the new game   series to the ground doesn t help nobody  i in person am happy there will be a new game...    keep up the good work but with a little less complaining   you got a new subscriber    grtz  a big tomb raider fan since 1998
maybe someone can make some fan mods remakes of the originals  cause these guys arent gonna do it anytime soon.
i liked pheobie  it s not her fault people take a boring actor writer and give her action roles... but jfc if she had any humanity in her  she d say  no  i don t want to ruin anyone s fun stories  i m a boring bi7  y feminist  i don t belong around fun time. i like fleabag because i  pheobie  am boring  unfun trash..... i m built for swinging wildly between  unstoppable girl bawss  and  crying uncontrollably in my trailer because i don t have the conviction to get over these trolls so i m inspiring people to follow in my perpetual misery  .ps - maybe if they weren t getting trolled so badly  they d stop ruining our characters  we re making them hateful husks of humans for lols  and that s not exactly good for anyone.
lets face it this amazon production will focus on laras lovelife and relationships... she will be portrayed as a flawed morally good hero.  they will make the audience pity her because they will show shes a victim.... all aspects of lara that we dont want.
you d think the original concept for tr would be popular with the modern feminists. young woman who s strong and confident and refuses to be married off. lol
oh look  yet another franchise being given to 90s zoomers. all this talk of representation  when literally literally every franchise is being given exclusively to a cast comprised of 90s zoomers.
also   they made lara a murderer of people. completely defeated the purpose of the games. lara should have been fighting dinosaurs  large animals   wolves  and occasionally a bad guy every now and then   not killing hundreds of people over and over again . tomb raider legend was the last good tomb raider game of all time. lara croft was made for the nerdy male gamer. she was a sexy action icon designed for us originally . now  we have nobody to fap to... thanks game gods.. you suck
another doa series. i though we frowned on abusing women and no lead female video game character has had it worse than poor lara
how does pheobe waller-bridge keep getting hired  everything she touches turns into a woke dumpster fire evicerating a long standing franchise
i never considered the new tr the real lara. i tolerated that first change of the excaliber and thor hammer reboot but now  she s been replaced by that same dumb young adult nobody character who get thrown into situation where  they are special  when they are actually a boring uninteresting nobody-just like that hunger games catness! they keep making her to be  that  nothing interesting character!
for me i m not gonna pre doom this just like any entertainment. i ll have to see  experience it myself. if like it i like it and vice versa. because tv  movies will always be different then its source material whether its books or games. that s the fucking reality of it. so take it for whats it worth and then move on.
anybody else just so underwhelmed that once again big corp has bought rights to beloved franchise   and aims to completely corrupt to woke what made aforementioned franchise great .forgive me gonna skip this one and focus on the old  forgotten  originals   does that make me a tcm watcher   maybe but at least i will have my memories of a well told story   and maybe   just maybe if enough people say no thanks to big corp they will stop doing it as there is no money in it anymore .
i m a big fan of tomb raider  and resident evil. i just pretend the resident evil series doesn t exist  which i ll do with this series  it s 2023  and amazon  it s going to be ideological propaganda . the worst part is amazon is also poisoning the games now  whereas resident evil games are made in anti-woke japan  and safe from that poisoning.
amazon just bought the tomb raider franchise for 600 million.
it doesn t matter who makes produces this. it s garbage. live action anime and live action movies based off of video game franchises have historically been terrible. they re throwing money in the toilet. or so it would seem. i think the real reason they re dismantling fandoms one by one is so that they can retcon decades worth of pop culture and memory hole everything we once knew them to be. keep a mental note of streamers  friends  family  and community members that support this. just so later down the line when they try to hop the fence and pretend they had nothing to do with this  you can hold them accountable. whatever that amounts to at the time...
i liked reacher and the boys.
you forgot  wheel of time  fans. yep  saw this coming. amazon will ruin everything they touch.
first rings of power  now lara croft. what ll amazon wanna destroy next  probably stargate since they have mgm s library anyway. ugh.
for real  classic lara was actually a feminist icon but then feminism got even more stupid and they hate her now lol!
@meloniemacgoboom  they can t admit that gaming actually used to not be all toxic masculinity.
tlou is good thus far. i don t fancy seeing joel s head caved in again though but i doubt druckmann will retcon that.
same.
i see a reply  but i guess yt has shadowbanned it. this is just getting really pathetic. one reason why i am trying to switch over to rumble.
i mean... i really liked the boys and invincible. better amazon than netflix i guess.
i was really hoping for rhona mitra  she was absolutely perfect as lara croft... not angelina jolie...
go boom dariling
they gonna mess up with god of war as well.
again... they re doing it again
only sophia nomvete can save tomb raider.
so what happened to the netflix animated series.
there is only 2 tomb raiders and both of  em were attached to angelina jolie.  o  o
they making a dora the explorer themed tomb raider
flea bag strikes again....she is helping destroy indy s legacy even more and now tomb raider. she also helped really ruin the last james bond i hear
face it  raiders... we will have to live of the past.
but it has to reflect the world we live in today hollywood
it has nothing to do with todays topic  but you with todays look you look a lot like megara from hercules
oh boy here we go amazon...
they just need to make their own new franchise called  relic replacer  and leave tomb raider and lara alone.tomb raider born 1996  died 2023.
miss melonie  ask nerdrotic about phoebe   jennifer salke.  you ll be even more annoyed
well i will not be shocked if they turn lara into a lesbian. my sympathy to you melonie
that s such bad news and tomb raider is  my favorite game of all time!!
everything is made for narcissists who never grew up emotionally or in their personality.this is so weird.30 years ago the narcissists at least made some neat movies  today they wear weird hair colors  are socially stuck in high school  look cringey and smell abhorrent.
let us hope they don t destroy warhammer 40k
thank you so much  d
tomb raider is going to suffer big time
tomb raider  just let it die
fuck... some one make a time machine or something.
oh great another lauren hissrich
5 they re gonna race swap lara
it s sad to see something you love turned to...... well i ll be polite and not say poop about it.
uh. now i feel bad for you. i am really sorry. but you are not alone. we all suffer because of them. let s suffer together now
that thumbnail. lol
hi melonie that s another 1 i m not going to see of series.have great weekend melonie
i bet there s gonna be race swap
prepare for another  1 billion disaster!3....2....1 let the memes begin!
dear god whyyyy
ruining indiana jones and tomb raider  phoebe really gets around
being a tomb raider fan myself i m not very excited either.
i think phoebe waller bridge needs to stick to original stuff like fleabag  i haven t seen it but i heard it was good
fleabag is good show
oh sh t  here we go again.
aaaaannnd she s gone. tomb raider is gone.
i have all three of the  reboots . i enjoyed them. but i m not buying it again.
what has amazon studios done well   not much.
i am so sorry for the loss of one of your favorite franchises  phoebe waller-bridge will ruin it.
shadow of the tomb raider left a bad taste in my mouth. i am praying they listen to us
not tomb rader! i already know it s not going to be good because you re not casted as lara.
angelina jolie portait lara as an adrenaline j nkie  which is way more in character than anything that came out after 2008.
i m gonna pretend i didn t hear that
10  they replace her with... you can guess.
made for modern audiences   made for the woke masses  and screw what the core fan-base actually wants to see
the new lara croft is going to be a raging dumpster fire
pwb involved  can only say... why !
when are the hollywood crazies will realize that they need to leave our favorite things alone  they don t understand it  they don t try to understand it  the clearly hate the source material that they re trying to adapt. not everything needs to be for a  modern audience  we don t want the lost  timid  insecure lara  give us classic lara croft!!the tomb raider and also stop giving waller-burning bridge franchises to burn down!
oh  boy... can t wait for butch les lara croft!
i m not watching anything made by amazon since the wheel of time destruction.
amazon and a show with a female protagonist  are you freaking kidding me
when i saw the news i thought of you lol.
why are they so out of touch with what tomb raider fans actually want
seriously  a tomb raider series  hmm... i m sure it ll be fine. don t give up your hopes... yeah... didn t convince me either. but i m sure well get used to a  re-imagined  flat ch ested  diverse  lara croft  bravely womansplaining they them twerking ass out of situations...
rip tomb raider and god of war if the same people that performed forced gender reassignment surgery on wheel of time have a hold of both series.
i have no hope for it at all.
they won t listen to us  hate to crush your hope but your expectations will at least be realistic haha. check my past upload and you can see what the leaks said  it is gonna be awful lol
maybe if gal gadot picks ups the guns...
we re f...ed  that s certain.
no thanks  it would be nice for an unknown to take the role. one suitably buxom too...
at least the resident evil games are thriving !
phoebe waller bridge is massive in the uk... she rose to fame doing a tv series called fleabag which won loads of awards.  shes a standard feminist and will 100  mess up lara crofts character.
!!jeyeah! ! yall laughed  ahen antos lady said and i quote why dont we all just band together and buy itwittert...ourselves.....yeah... i laughed too.nkw  i m like...aww shyt.. we are gonna hafta buy our damn heroes
my expectations for amazon s tomb raider  lara croft will be a black chick with red hair  identify as  they them  and carries a strap-on  instead of pistols
they should have used barbie instead of lara croft
resurrect it jus to kill it again but properly ruined this time.
so cute
they need to make their own damn stuff instead of ruining everyone else s.
sadly melmac s prized possession gets shat upon  it being 2023  could we expect any less    lara will be recast as a poc with alphabet and pronoun issues ala velma
don t bother seeing anything pw-b has done either.
looks like the dead space game is doing pretty good mel make a apology   address the retarted  video about the faces ruining the game
not showing the youtube 100k award
please god no
i bet its a bff adventure with her trans bff .....
damage control!!!!!!
commenting to feed the algorithm
indiana jones was not enough and now fleabag wants to ruin another franchise based around historical artifacts.
halo fans  first time
nooooooo!
well  when you see who s writing it  that tells you all you need to know it ll be shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
seen you in vara dark!
hopefully its a great show but as u said  they already have a bad reputation. lets see what happens but with our luck  lara will be a trans with pixie hair.
sad times
sad
bahaha dead on arrival
d.o.a
that s not lara croft
she is self inserting. it s on imdb
fleabag croft will be doa.
melonie you re so purrrrrty
the moment i heard phoebe waller-bridge... i nearly puked.
man  that is seriously disappointing to hear.
this franchise is done..
do not want. in other words  d
i m expecting a trash fire.
they should take the game back to when tomb raider and lara croft back to tomb raider v chronicles  it was so much better
starring mindy kaling...
i wonder if she will go from a badass woman who kicks ass to some whiny person who complains about men and other issues and turns into a cringe fest. with bad dialogue that targets an audience who won t watch it
it s going to get worse. a lot worse. just when you think it can t get any worse  it does. bye bye lara croft!!!!!!
can t wait for the petite 99lb but good looking mary sue defeats the predator in hand to hand combat then yells get to the choppa!
phoebe waller bridges after she destroyed indy 5   james bond.amazonand the fact that some fools want the skinny twig notyennefer to play lara  which i hope they don t do . man this is gonna be a mess.
given how she s involved with the cluster fuck that is indiana jones and the dial of destiny i want her no where near lara croft
this sounds like that  librarian  tv show that flopped...
end tomb raider and just start a different story. what is being currently presented has little to do with the original. just hire abby from the last of us and have her go on woke adventures.
i am an ot star wars fan. i feel your pain.
oh no oh my oh humanity this is awful and terrible . i am so sad and mad that they are making this awesome   cool   rad classic tomb raider video game into a tv show series on amazon prime. anyway i am so sad and mad that they are doing it. anyway i do hope that the amazon prime production company have a great person to play lara croft part on the tv show series and not just a stupid and dumb boring person who knows nothing about how tomb raider would be like if it was a video game that made into a tv show series  ok melonie. anyway i just want to tell you what my thoughts are bout the tomb raider tv show series on amazon prime and i just want to tell you that i am so sad and upset and angry and mad that they are making tomb raider tv show series on amazon prime and they are just killing it major big time and tomb raider fans are mad at them for doing it  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to tell you that and i just want to tell you that i am so happy for you for getting a award for your youtube boom channel and i just want to tell you that congrats to you for your wonderful and great success with your hard work that you do for your fans to make these great videos for us everyday and every month and every year. anyway congrats to you melonie. hope you had a great day today at home and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great blessed weekend too melonie. god bless you and god bless your hard work that you do for your fans. anyway have a great day and evening melonie.
join us angry game fans. i hate they made a last of us show and i hate that they re making a horizon show. now it s your turn to be mad.
western entertainment has been having issues with rampid phobia of attractive feminine women tomboy or not for awhile now as well as masculine men that are jerks and or dumbs
oooohh this gone be bad
i can clearly feel the indy 5 ripoff in these storylines ..
another ip bites the dust  although tomb raider is already damaged goods.
nnnnnnnnooooooooo
i m expecting bezos to bring in a trans lara.
why do i just know that lara will be black and lesbian on this
tomb raider games are pretty good  but the jonah character could be dropped  i don t like the whole friendship not alone aspect. she feels connected to unimportant characters like the fat somoan guy.
oh god...
i don t think angelina jolie was a very good lara croft but she was entertaining at least.
they ve already ruined tomb raider a long time ago  being mad is nothing new for us tr fans lol
amazon prime sucks  they have ads  paid channels and you have to still pay for the amazon prime membership.
complaining about it now is pointless  damage been done for years now unfortunately..
the next gsme. you are   nice.
yet another series they are out to ruin.
toilet flushes once again.
no not everything amazon has made is awful  i would say most of the shows are pretty great. just beacuse they have made one shit show  does not mean that the rest are
you should not be excited about this.my condolences.
hereditary reactionary  can tell
and amazon is going to be involved with the 40k live action series.... abandon hope....-star wars  star trek  40k  dnd  pathfinder  mtg  marvel  dr who and now tomb raider.....   woke ruins all....
did u just come back from the gym
i actually like the recent tomb raide rmovie  but this sounds awful  riverdale vibes
lets hope these tv series will be good ive mean the 2018 movie was good
noooooooooo
tak!
yeah  i pass this show
in the future a young sassy daredevil woman will be exploring an ancient tomb in derby  england   make the ultimate discovery... a copy of an old relic called tomb raider for something called the playstation.   thus  a new legacy is born. because tomb raider is officially dead.
tr 20 years up there with my favorite games. this show is going to be trash. is this how they plan to destroy culture
calling it now -- lara will be a race swapped androgynous they them
amazon didn t ruin anything for lotr fans. they don t own lotr. rop is as canonical as velma is - there s a scooby doo movie coming out  and it very obviously disregards velma  just like disney world and land both still have white ariel on display.... will black ariel get the same backlash that velma did for not being black enough  or will ariel be a rapper now  she got warrants!!!!
o no no no no that wil be bad i hoop not but
contact me for your reward
if phoebe waller-bridge has anything to do with this it s going to be crap.
love you
burry it
first fallout now this just leave things alone besos the world doesn t need more tv.
aaaaaaaand they going to completely botch this  this is going to probably be as bad as velma  and atrocious self-insert or something equally bad!
they about to ruin laura croft
tragic.
well time to throw another i.p in the trash
please god no...
can t wait  the story will start off with a non-binary person  named laura.......and it will just get better from there.
i mean  it can t get much worse than the last tomb raider movie  can it the laura character in that movie just annoyed me  and the actress didn t fit ...
hey i see me!  d
oh man  this is going to suck so bad.
tomb raider lesbian! hand  action barbie and friends!
i still keep getting spams that are pretending to be you
another dead franchice... sad
tom raider woke  i m out.
amazon  just stop!!!!!! the games are already ruined...
hey girl i totally respect et love your hard work but guuurlll c mon everything you said is negative about the future of tomb raider .im an og fan also but you should get happy that at least tomb raider isn t dying   tomb raider will never be an core design game again you should accept that this licence is moving on to someting new  like you can t say is going to be trash when you haven t seen anything about it
they completely destroyed wot
my woke version of tomb raider-----------------------------------------------------laura croft weighs 300 pounds on a scootershe enters the tomb of walmart and fights the trans-men to get the golden doughnut.final boss is the black security guard who s disabled and on a wheel chair. nerf guns will be included. action packed with pointless social justice one liners!
it s gonna stink.
i ll predict the lara croft in that show. whiny  girl power but not the cool kind  not ounce of athleticism and   f l a t  not very attractive.
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0
aaaand another one bites the dust...
rip lara. she s also a black transman now
there nothing wrong with females having female love interests. i just hate how they keep using established characters who showed no signs of being gaey before. these shows will never rise above fan fiction.
well  i think it s time to cancel my netflix. it s all garbage anymore.might get rid of prime in the process.
angelina jolie made a good tomb raider  but her movies sucked
amazon  greenlight that shit
@josh_032  i wrote the script using chat gtp ahahaha! i had to adjust the wording because it won t do offensive stuff.
amazon i m out.
nooooooo
he s gonna look like a man   gonna have  i need no man  attitude.
why not make lara a man  lawrence craft
finally the english white teenage girl can be the trans black lesbian she always was lmao
anything pwb has to do with turns to shit
so.. lara croft will become a black trans male that identify as a tree....
so pheobe waller-bridge ruined indiana jones  now she s going to ruin tomb raider.  disgusting.
if waller bridge is attached to this then it s going to suck. she was in indy 5 and she is an insufferable cow in that one. she is a self insert character who derides indy and no doubt she is going to be lara in this as well. i call a lesbian who saves treasures from  greedy men from evil culture stealing museums  to give to the local populace to  save indigenous culture  or some bs like that. also she s properly not even going to be english  given the amount of anti-english sentiment there is these days.why not change it up a bit and have a few stories of her going up against larson or pierre for treasures  have a  what if  that lara was never hoired by natla to find the scion and just have lara globe trot in pursuit or being followed by larson and pierre as they race to get the treasures of the world. i for one would love to see more of larson and pierre.  the old pierre in the leather coat and the new smarter larson from anniversary.  and maybe something with jerome  the kid  johnson or  kold  kin kade  theres mnore then enough in the first game and maybe introduce the fami nera as well
so amazon has the boys  the terminal list  and invincible on their amazon prime  but because rings of power was terrible  somehow everything they touch is bad. i wonder if you keep that same energy when other studios pump out bad material to the market and say everything they touch is trash.
i couldn t give two craps if an original property makes a girl on girl love story  but with lara croft who has never liked girls it makes zero sense and feels like a forced pandering tool
lmaooooo
womb raider. oh excuse me i meant birthing person raider.
i guess hollywood thinks no straight women exist anymore eh  so much for muh representation
read the names of the people involved... pff. tomb raider lara croft needs a man to make her feminime again. woman will make her lesbian  enjoy her.
black trans lara croft incoming.
i m  sorry but phoebe waller-bridge doesn t cut the mustard. she totally doesn t suit the role. it will be a disaster but will amazon listen  seems not.
rip tomb raider. can t wait for lara to be race-swapped and made gay.
this kind of stuff is why i never want to see a metroid movie this kind of bullshit is to ruin what little there is to like about the franchise just like star wars and the like. hopefully one day a passionate fan will be able to either make a replacement for tomb raider and or get the rights of tomb raider from the current owners because they have desire to make a good tomb raider game.
we have to ditch these ip s  make new ones  and pray to god they don t sell out once they achieve success.  gaming  is for normies now  we need to create a new distinction and guard that gate for real.
wait till they make her black in that show.
leave tomb raider alone!!
gonna suck
it s going to suck.
and trans. biological male.
another one bites the dust. i wonder what hollywood will do when they ve finally ruined every great franchise  they clearly lack the talent and creativity to write their own stories.
i really cannot see the appeal of phobe waller bridge. is it simply most writers in hollywood are way too ugly
of course she ll be gay can t have an on screen woman like men anymore
another woke disaster
100  she s gonna be an extreme feminist lesbian
lara will be played by a 300 lb trans asain man
comment for the algorithm
its dead on arrival  just like it s live action movie. nobody cares about nu-lara.
meep
done.. and nope
yeah  it will be ruined the same way there. mmo was poorly optimized game play.oh wait  people are ok with that.
nope.
last tomb raider movie was very bad
ooh i so can t wait to watch a tv series about a woke genderfluid lesbian pansexual tomb raider that explores the ancient patriarchy.
u can hate the reboot but it is a reboot and with a reboot nothing has to be the same and the old games sucked and yes i played one as a kid and hated it
shadow of the tomb raiders kill it for me one of the worst game i ve ever played
amazon netflix disney all you money loveing stream rubish please go away please please leave good stuff alone and get your own stuff.
fleabag was a cringe piece of garbage you can t get through the first season no matter how hard you try probably just as good as velma
oh great a woman who never played tomb raider will write a tomb raider show smh
that writer is the worst! she ruined the last bond movie! more hollywood garbage!
they will ruin every ipi bet she is gonna be a trans  muslim women lol
tomb raider must be a brown trans-woman.
phoebe waller bridge s obnoxious feminist comedy writing   tomb raider  what could go wrong
they need to stop making shows of video games
as the god of war.. i will save lara croft.. from this demonic mob.. i will use my blades of chaos to save her  hold up what is  it preferred pronoun they  fuck it i m saving lara!!
reboots are stupid  why change something beyond recognition when you can create something new  makes no since to just keep the title  names and that s it lol
@meloniemacgoboom  yeah but they do it to try and sell to more people not just the old fans it is all about making money also we all know that some how real life things mess games up but i am also sure i might have still liked the new games is it wasnt a reboot and it was just better gfx and new games but think of the hate i mean u know her old look lol
