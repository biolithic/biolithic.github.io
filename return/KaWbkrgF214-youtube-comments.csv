i almost miss my old career in my 20s when i attracted beautiful ladies like this host. being a christian who doesn t sell drugs is way more fulfilling 

hey  melonie  just wanted to take a minute to thank you for all the hard work you do across your channels i try my best to keep up with things that are happening  but you manage to cover news and stories that i can miss. but what s more  you do it in a way where i don t have to worry about your content being vulgar. it s incredibly refreshing to be able to watch listen to videos and look at thumbnails that don t prominently feature the word f    all the time.but best of all  you consistently find ways to weave god into what you re talking about it  and you do it in a way that stays true to scripture. you don t allegorize or put a progressive spin on it. you give the gospel truth  and i love hearing it.praying that god continues to bless you and your platforms  and that he continues to mold you into who he wants you to be. thank you again for all your hard work and effort. i hope you have a fantastic tuesday
