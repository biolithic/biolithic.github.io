accept the Bible stuff this was a very good video for me. nice job

Ive been stuck in the same routine for a long time now. its not a bad routine but Im getting tired of it. Ive been praying every night that God will nudge me in the right direction  but like you said he isn t going to just show me exactly what I should do. I know I need to take the first step.
