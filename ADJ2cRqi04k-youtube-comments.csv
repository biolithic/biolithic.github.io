the people that call you a  bad person for something like this are usually the worst type of people with many skeletons in their own closet!
the response of  we just wanted to make a good game  is the best response. that s the important thing
i m glad to see that avalanche studios has taken the correct approach to this situation. it is clear that they made an active choice to focus on producing the best possible product for the customers. i m not a harry potter fan  i wasn t really invested in this to any degree  but if my laptop can handle it i m inclined to check the game out based on my belief that the developers tried very hard to produce a fun game.your verse reminds me of my favorite quote from t.s. elliot s  murder in a cathedral    the last temptation is the greatest treason  to do the right deed  for the wrong reason.
there is no controversy. it s on every second double decker bus and billboard in london. and despite never searching for it and the game not even being out yet there are dozens of youtubers doing videos with preview copies in the recommended videos down the right hand side of every video i ve watched today. this game is huge.
the harry potter books inducted my entire generation to the joys of reading. rather than receiving reverence and acting as a guide  she s one of many authors mocked by people who apparently don t read.
melanie mac must be protected at all costs.
you re awesome melonie. thanks for always having the courage to speak up
pretty amazing you using your platform to not only do your show but preach the gospel too and you do it well! i m really proud of you for being such a warrior. you re blowing my mind this is my 3rd vid on you today just discovered you lol and you already taught me something! wish id known it before but im being groomed for ministry myself so im happy to have found you! you re very inspiring
i m not a big fan of harry potter  never really cared much for the books of movies  but i m super excited for the game. i love rpgs so this is no different. the backlash against the game will only turn it in a massive success. majority of gamers don t care about jks views besides faux activists who aren t even gamers. looking forward to playing it when it releases!
this game is the best thing to happen during the culture war by far. i love it.
im so fucking happy they made this response  no seriously though its sooooooo refreshing to finally see some devs not give in to the bullshit this game will do well even after launch
do they ever learn that boycotting anything and a game for the matter has never worked will always blow up in their faces
as i ve previously said  i wish this game the best of luck and may its sales reflect its quality  if it s a good game may it be a contender for game of the year and sell millions of units
what blows my mind is that these wailing harpies shrieking about hogwarts legacy fail to grasp that their cries of boycot makes the game much more appealing to the sane normal people. for once we will have a game who s community will not be poisoned by the most insane lunatics forever shrieking at us and demanding ever more acts of celebration and penance from the rest of us. the most annoying population will not be in this games community or on its servers. sign me up please!
buying 3 copies of the game  also buying all the potter books and movies again! long live rowling!
i fear for the future of our society.  thank you for helping me recognize the evils at play.
at this point pissing off these people is just a bonus. as a gamer i will support any project that is a single player only game with no forced online content or loot box mechanics that works to be the best product it can be and that fans want.
i laughed hysterically as i purchased two pre order copies of the deluxe edition
best channel on the youtube. period. thank you for everything you re doing  dear melonie! greetings from germany!
already pre-ordered hogwarts legacy and cant wait to play it  just recently found your channel and i am loving it !!  so refreshing to here your thoughts and takes on this craziness going on !!   what is your twitch channel
exactly  it s projection.
guilt....
they are mere peasants.
this is why you never kneel to them.
for real. on one level  it s thinking you re morally superior  but then even another level of sanctimoniously trying to police other citizens.
most of them are deviants
true words
yep. classic projection
good people don t have to scream from the mountaintops that they re good people because their actions show itoh  and i promise you many of the trans allies who are  boycotting  this game also pre ordered it...
every corporation needs to divorce themselves from the societal bs that is going on. i don t need pepsi  coke  nike  apple ...... to shape the morals of society ..... i need them to produce good  safe products. that is literally all they should worry about. if anyone thinks all the employees of any major corporation has the exact same opinions on anything ..... they re an idiot. point being none of them have one truly united opinion on anything  so stop expecting them to express one.
yeah sure  but jkr said nothing wrong  he should just say she said nothing wrong the game is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.
@cozzie4ra  thats not how the world works buddy
@cozzie4ra  no  the game is the important thing. the drama is extra. this shouldn t even be a discussion but of course haters have to make something out of nothing for attention.
@batman0  nailed it. whether the game developers agree or disagree  it s best to focus on what s important. the game itself.
@cozzie  it s better for the game developers to focus on what s important the game.i d rather them focus on that than weigh in on political stuff.they are an entertainment company. focus on the entertainment.
@cozzie4ra  that s the problem is everybody wants to focus on jk rowling and it takes away from the game  you people as well  as the woke mob. sorry to say but is not it video game developers place to tell what is or is not okay to say  their job is to make good video games for the fans and not be focused on politics. a lot of people are buying this game simply due to the politics  but a lot of people are buying this game because they love harry potter and don t give a s    about the politics. the real question is is which side are you going to stand on are you going to stand on the side of video games and not pandering to the woke ideology of politics  or are you going to stand on the side where you just want to keep a conflict going for the hell of it. or are you just going to be a cool person who loves video games and loves harry potter and wants this to do well because at the end of the day you want good video games that don t focus on real life situations. there s a reason why videogames are popular and it s not because you want to compare it to real life but it s an escape to get away from the real world. so if anybody wants to keep jabbing about j.k. rowling instead focusing on this game being gray and making a great  then you are part of the problem and not part of the solution and should leace  we don t need you. we never did  and the funny thing is this game would have been successful regardless of what jk rowling said or didn t say. i can count on my hands and feet let alone on a piece of paper how many people i ve talked to who are going to buy this game regardless of what jk rowling said. numbers don t lie  hence why the movies did so well  hence why the books did so well  hence why some of the older video games even did pretty well even though they weren t that great. the fact is harry potter is a big-name and almost everywhere in the world it s known. it doesn t need the name jk rowling attached to it for people to know what the wizarding world of harry potter is. let alone hogwarts.
@toddtaylor6506  thanks for saying what we re all thinking!
blue haired vegan skeletons.
jokes on them  they can t shame someone who already thinks they aren t necessarily a good person  their judgments will always be beneath our own judgment of self
i m a sex offender  and i support this game. i m getting the most expensive one out of spite for the real bad people.
fucking nailed it mate
it s like people who keep accusing someone of cheating. they turn out to he the biggest cheats themselves
exactly. been proved time after time with the most recent example of the purple tinker person being exposed
strangei mean i am christian but you took harry potter. a franchise about witches to flex all about christianity i mean yeah i m a christian but super weird flex to be like so this video is all about a witch franchise now let me talk about how amazing christianity is!i mean you realize what witches comes from right  just weirdest flex i ve ever seen. it would be like sjws are trying to cancel halloween. an innocent sweet family friendly holiday. now let me tell you how amazing christianity is and irs like wait what...no i don t think she s bad i don t think she s bad in any shape or formjust praising slmething that s anti christianity only to then talk about how amazing christianity is it s so weird
psshh wokeness is pureness. if you commit to being woke today  you become a born again virgin. i ll guide you  enter pronouns here  so that you can be united with the woke jesus. wokeness reigns suprememe! i m going to type woke one more time. woke  sh t i can t get enough of it. woke  woki... wookie
@ogdin3  hey now  i ve seen quite a few with plenty of  excess  lol.
@roluevasreisa5730  that s not what it s about at all.. she has never made comment about that  what people are pissed about is because some people believe that her description of goblins is meant to resemble jews  even though jkr herself has never said that and if you look at most cultural references to goblins depict them in much the same way and have since before ww2 even tolkien s goblins were very similar and had the same characteristics  and that she stated a fact that trans women can t have periods because they don t have a uterus which is a fact no amount of hormone therapy can ever change  and devalues the experience and struggle of every female that identifies as such  and she spoke out about the growing trend of trans women out performing in their own respective sports like one of the top women s mma fighters that is trans who fought for 7 years before her transition and barely had a win rate that kept her in nature divisions and after her transition competed in women s mma and is now at. 90   win rate because she is a man and as such has a muscular makeup that makes her out compete women at a biological level
@roluevasreisa5730  and not to get it mixed up i m not an anti semite or transphobic nor do i support either of those things but reaching to create a narrative that villifies fictional creatures and jews by making a comparison is wrong and those who think that s what she intended i would argue are more anti semitic  and people who propogate transphobia are also assholes  you want to be a man or a woman makes no difference to me  you re a trans woman who wants to sign up for beauty competitions ect go for it but there is a reason sports leagues are separated by gender and having trans people compete in those is wrong because it puts trans women at an advantage and trans men at a disadvantage  and no matter what you identify as or how much therapy you have biological boundaries still exist and by breaking those you discriminate against the right of people who are born into those genders it s as simple as that
@roluevasreisa5730  harry potter is a work of fiction. further more its a work.of fiction and its  story value  is about  love  freindship  bravery  togetherness  facing ur fears  etc. all of these things are christian values. being a witch or wizard  in this story   isnt even the same meaning u just tried to tie it to.
absolutely  we have already figured out what to do about  bad people  you throw them in prison.  it would be different if they were consistent.  but words are violence but actual violence isnt.
perfectly true. it s as per their false god saul alinsky s  rules for radicals    vigorously projecting your own sins and wrong doing onto your target and that vehemently to avoid being themselves called out on their own actions and words. their own fear and desperation to avoid being called on their behavior is like that of spoiled children.
reminds me very much of a born again christian so all of a sudden it is ok to judge everyone else for their sins now that yours are forgiven kind of hypocritical.  if the game hasn t even been released yet how can you even have a credible review of it.  maybe because it doesn t have a gay character to choose right off the bat or something else ridiculous that doesn t pertain to the story itself.  maybe it will be great who knows but you have to give it an honest chance before you bury it as being a bad game.  i miss the time when you really didn t care about politics in a video game and you just loved great play control  and engaging story and high replay value.
@chris read  nobody cares bot and spammjng your comments and then liking your own comments doesn t make anyone agree with you lol
they call us  bad people   and yet they re the ones who will spend eternity in hell for not following christ
alternatively they don t want to help a bad person
its also very narcissistic behavior all eyes on me  what i say goes  i am a broken individual but hide behind a righteous facade. i project my problems and things i hate on you to make it seem like its you that are the problem  never hold a mirror at me or reflect my words back at me  i can t stand it  i can dish it out but can t take it  i don t need to change  the world needs to think and act like me.
all the woke people  i swear when they talk  other woke people might agree with some of what they say  but i just hear the grumbling sounds that the adults in charlie brown make in the cartoons. it s just nonsense.
@brianok9939    liking a video game makes anyone a bad person though  honestly  how does liking a video game based on the most loved  best selling  and most popular kids stories of all time make anyone a bad person  and what are the defining standards of a bad person  what actually makes someone a bad person . truly  since you are asking about  bad people  because there seems to be no actually standards committees for bad people or ones who send out tweets that people disagree with.
@fletcherplumb8826  i hear the north pole and the south poles are free for anyone to use all year round  i m sure they would thrive there just fine.
aka all lefties
agreed those who make accusations tend to be guilty of the accusations and are trying to push someone else under the bus to save themselves
scuba  you legit summed up everything i personally wanted to say but never found the words to do so. thanks friend and please people  enjoy this game or not. it s your world  your choice and your money. don t be bullied or follow the sheep. stay true to yourself and have faith in life. you ll be ok i promise.
@scuba_bro  what i said was  they don t want to help a bad person   not that they were. jkr is the bad person  not the player themselves  and by buying the game you are supporting here  that is the problem i have with all of this
@brianok9939  how exactly is jkr a bad person  what has she actually done to make her a  bad person   and what an odd thing it is  how people are so quick to demonize  and judge whether someone they ve never met nor known is a good person. everyone seems to have their moral compass pointing in the right direction
think about the poor people in ukraine next time you ve got a problem with something
@icebearnicho8256  what she did wrong wasn t like gossip or magazine talk. she attacked the trans community  then doubled down. not knowing her personally excuses her from this  why  because she s famous  so i m sure you can excuse what  person you disagree with  did do you because you don t know them personally  right
facts they are really saying they are the bad people but just projecting it on other people
@jamiefitz83  think about the starving people in africa who have daily genocidal acts taken against them  and starvation before you think about ukraine.
they re didn t take the correct approach  they took the diplomatic approach.what they re doing is distancing themselves from her.what the correct approach is - is standing by rowling s right to free speech and expression. supporting her stance  on child safety and woman rights. and admonishing the harassment and full on psychotic behavior these people have been engaging against both rowling and anything related to her  every day.don t let the overton window shift your view of correctness. the correct choice isn t always diplomacy  the correct choice is not negotiating with terrorists.
@anedime  very well said.
the game so far looks pretty amazing imho  no matter if you know the potter stuff or not.
i wondered today if the boycott backfired and helped the game.  if the delay privately was at least in part to distance launch from the controversy s peak  the extra time could mean a much stronger game at launch.  avoids criticisms that could have been hurled at the game  bugs  incompleteness ...  to kill post-launch sales.  and then the boycott fire doesn t seem to be burning as brightly these days.
i just checked the system requirements on steam  i thought they would be much higher  but they are fine
its avalanche software  not studios two different studios
the amount of youtube i had to unsub from and block because of this shit is astounding.just when i think i found someone chill and interesting  they start preaching about how they  will not discuss or play hogwarts legacy because of reasons.  and anyone that says this specifically does so for one of only two reasons  either they re buckling to bullies  or a part of them. neither is worth respect or support.all something needs to be a controversy is public disagreement between two opposing parties.
@anedime  or they don t want to have anything to do with the community and rowling.
@crushinggamer  then they would say they re not interested.  i will not discuss or play it because of reasons  is an intentionally vague statement alluding to the current event. an impartial person simply wouldn t care.
@anedime  the best way to go about it  is to just state that you don t want anything to do with this whole thing and move on.
its the most sold steam and psn game rn and thats only on pre order sales im hoping this game is massive for two reasons one just to rub it in the face of all these babies amd tell them  i told you so  and 2 its fuckin harry potter
the real meaning of   controversy  is causing a  disscussion  or disagreement. with this in mind u cant even realistically say there isnt a controversy. the fact that it is on every billboard  and the praise or shun of people with diffrent opoinions about is the exact definition of controversy.
@crushinggamer  the best way to go about it is to just not play they game if you don t want to play they game  you don t need to announce it. in fact  you don t need to announce anything you re not going to do  you can just not do it
@superabound2  well that works for the common folk. but for people that play games for a living. they need to somehow explain to their viewers why they won t be seeing the game played by them  or they have to taken a somewhat stance on the whole thing.
biggest game since the witcher 3
@crushinggamer  no  they don t. even creators can simply not play a game. they don t have to explain why
@patrickshade3844  not that simple. but keep living in your bubble bud. no worries
@crushinggamer  it is. it s a simple matter of choice. choices have consequences  of course  be it good or bad  but a simple matter of choice nonetheless
facts.
who
oh my bad  you re talking about the girl talking on the screen above. i m not a regular user of this channel  it just came up in my feed and i thought i ll watch it see what she has to say. didn t care what her name was.
why
just like the gilette boycott
@heinzerbrew  the razor company
@boomingbob1579  yes  they had an add that was insulting to men  and like you said the boycott didn t work. i no longer buy gillete. although  it s really hard to know how much the parent company was to blame. can t boycott everything...
the game is  boycotted  by people who don t buy games.
@heinzerbrew  yeah boycotting rarely of ever works usually it doesn t prevent something from coming out but it works more on movies than anything else game boycott i can t think of it ever working even damaging the sales or buying it usually explodes either because they check it out or out of spite
@trucid2  they are boycotted but people who have never seen wot happens after a boycott is declared especially game boycotts
@trucid2  it is a bold strategy  i m sure it will work out great for them.
shhhh .it s fun to watch and therapeutic for me lolol
@ericwalker6477  it is fun to watch but they won t learn so keep enjoying it
plenty of boycotts worked thoughout history. it s just not an option with gamers. every gamer is one 2 minute gameplay clip away from caving in.it s not a boycott issue  it s a gamer issue. gaming industry overall is extremely manipulative and anti-consumer. corporations have spent billions of dollars over the past few decades to make sure to shift the gamer mindset into one that s malleable and easily manipulated  that s why gaming protests don t work.
even if it is goty potential the people who give out these awards are all woke as hell so it ll never win the title even if it s the best game ever made.
@mrkevin486  depending on how credible they want to be afterwards  i think they ll have to acknowledge it. i mean hell even in reviews its getting really good reviews  even though most of the review is  buuuuuut jk rowlings.
@mrkevin486  if they didn t velma would of been a hit with much of the critics  but most of the critic reviews are rather low. i think we are starting to see that  some  realized the damage they have done to their reputation and as i mentioned credibility  and are trying to be more open.
@anedime   one 2 minute gameplay clip away from caving in  soooooooo accurate lolol
@geraldbouvy1222  with the exception of velma where we are all united that s it s crap but any other time most of the time when they are pissed it turned out to be insanely good
i pre-ordered it already!
@monikapanko2800  as you should
just ask hellena taylor...
@heinzerbrew  if that was the 2019 commercial  then the boycott did work.gillette stock prices dropped by roughly 39  in half a year after that one aired. even the highest peak it has in 2021 is 23  lower than its peak just before the ad.
@heinzerbrew  yes you can boycott it  why do you think less and less gillette commercials have been aired ever since that one commercial aired  i can tell you right now they didn t stop showing commercials because they just didn t want to. the fact is you can boycott a company without making the company completely shut down  and still have a good effect on it. that s why the people who aren t woke or let alone males don t support gillette and never will. so at the end of the day the boycott did work. and their profits show.
@anedime  if gaming protest  or boycotts don t work then explain why hogwarts legacy is going to be one of the best-selling games to hit the market in over a decade. also explain why the last of us 2 didn t do so well after the leak came out before the game was released. or how about the fact that they tried to control the violence in the original mortal kombat games  the fact is if enough people speak up and it affects their bottom line aka their money than nine times out of 10 they re going to take care of it and make sure the fans are taken care of  it hasn t been until the last decade the developers have started to work with the woke mentality and they see that the problem with it is simply money. if you want to make a lot of money with a video game then you best not go woke because it s always backfired and people know that  the woke mob is a minority not the majority and when you go around and you have a great establish game and then you try to change it into something it s not meant to be you re going to upset a lot of fans. 1 a good example outside of video games look at the new show velma. so sure protesting  and are trying to boycott may not completely bankrupt the company to completely stop themselves forever making a video game or any form of entertainment  but what it will do is lose enough profits to where nobody is ever going to put that kind of money into that investment again for that company simply due to the fact that they pander to the wrong society. so at the end of the day boycotting   game protesting actually does work. it s really a matter of perspective on what it works with and what it does. i m sorry to say but money  and prophets  and numbers never lie.
there is simply such a thing as a really good game - a lot of which are produced by independent developers.  i m going with this one because avalanche studios have a decent track record  with mad max and rage 2.
@abnon-tha3088  they also made disney infinity which had 3 good games
@darknessprophet  did the company reverse course and apologies. promise to never work with the people involved and to never insult men again i don t remember them doing that. i think they even double downed on their support for the ad creators. i could be wrong though
with a name like booming you would think you would remember the 1960s civil rights movement. that was actually boycotting was a point unlike what s happening with tis game.
@halicarnassus8235  wot does my name have to do with anything and i was talking about meaningless boycotting like movies and games not real life ones
@boomingbob1579  i was joking by  associating booming  with boomer.
@halicarnassus8235  oh
seriously. it s free advertising for them. of course  it s backfiring!
@zestybutterfly7161  naturally they tried to go after one of the most successful book authors ahd franchises snd expected it work
my gender is chair
i would not say there will be none. some of these people will tweet one thing and secretly get it anyway.
it s crazy when you think about it. woke has even infected mortal kombat  street fighter  call of duty  battlefield  a whole list of manly games where you wouldn t expect the devs to give a single crap about somethingawful  tumblr sheltered 1st world political nonsense.
yeap  im not into harry potter.  but when it comes out and the glitches are doable im buying it.
oh my gosh i didn t even think about this. the game looks great  but i was hesitant precisely because i hate the harry potter fandom. but you re exactly right  80  of the people who make it so horrible  which really is just a small portion of all fans  won t touch the game. they ve actually made a safe space from them lol.
the she  hers trans gang were the villains all along.
@timmytimmymit5607  you mean  its
@timmytimmymit5607  small hats have been the enemies of humanity for millenia.here s a quote from my favourite book.  the human being was supposed to be degraded to a number  to a soulless shell  which the rulers could assemble and employ at anytime with whatever sign. the boundaries of the nation were supposed to be destroyed  the difference of blood blurred through racial bastardization  so that the globe would henceforth be filled only with number-people  which could be added by the hand of the imperialists as desired and  above all  subtracted.
@manoz6194  what book is that from
@superabound2   the birth of the millennium  by kurt eggers. i highly suggest you get hold of his books. they are not long but they say so much. you may be put on a  list  if you do
they always will be.
same. ps5 and pc  em!
yea still out on pc not sure yet but i do have it on ps5 deluxe e can t wait wooooohooo!! take that wokers
@roughneckcountry  yessir!
aw shucks  thank you!
in other words your not going to ask a cat for consent to pet him her they them
not a harry potter fan. but i will be playing this game for sure  love magic and love a developer doing what he wants
also  i just wanna mention this game is rated m for mature. this allows for such better story telling and gameplay elements. i am so happy they made that choice.
typed on an iphone made by a slave child!   melonie laying down the real boom today
reading through some of the early previews yesterday  ign forbes  and just about every one i read had to inject their political beliefs into the article. why  how does help the consumer  and they wonder why games media is in a dire state. i really hope hogwarts legacy gets a fair shake when it comes time for reviews. if reviewers and or  journalists  can t put their feelings aside  i m sorry but they don t deserve to be in the industry. go take your activism somewhere else. no place for that crap in the industry. sorry  but it s getting tiring.
i just had a thought. what if the hogwarts legacy marketing team are behind the boycott movement  cuz they know it ll just make people wanna buy it more  lol
it s not possible to avoid dealing with unethical companies these days. microsoft  google  apple  they all do some pretty terrible things. i ve always liked when you put verses in your videos  btw  melonie. hope you have a wonderful day.
real gamers don t do  woke . we re killin it!
judging by the sales for pre-orders  there are a whole lotta bad people out there!  me included! i pre-ordered it for my 18 yo grandson.
one model and entertainer once said the important thing is people talk about you  especially on social media.  if the talk is positive or negative is not that important  the buzzword is what is important.this group of people have been doing free promotion and bringing this game buzz to non gamers... thanks for your service.
thank you for the mat. 6  hope this channel gets promoted to more people algorithmically 111k so far!
i love when you quote scripture in dealing with this garbage  hope you are doing well
i thought of that passage of scripture referring to  virtue signalling  just the other day. it s cool to see you sharing that on your show.
wow - a game developer that a.  respects the franchise and the lore and - just as importantly - b.  respects the fans.  supported and bought.
he did good addressing it like the boycotters  don t exist. just staying focused on the game. ignore the trouble makers eventually they go away.
i preordered this game a few days ago after seeing the latest videos about it.i m so looking forward to playing it. always loved the harry potter stories  i think this will be an amazing game for my taste.
i admit  i have done many things to be judged over  but...when the lord judges me  i m not sure if hogwarts legacy will make the list.
for once in my life i am proud i did a deluxe preorder just to stand against these nasty people
agree with this so much and will be buying a copy of the game when it comes out - as your tweet says people in glass houses shouldn t throw stones when trying to setup boycotts for this game.
thank you for supporting the folks who made the game! just subscribed!
i so happy i have one pre-ordered.  i think these people actually lose most of their sleep over finding crap to complain about.    thanks for the great commentary!
i thought it was rated e for everyone that agrees theres only 2 genders
that would be a master move.
if that s the case then holy fuck  they re nearly wesker level of a mastermind  o
i doubt that.
stranger things have happened  i suppose.
then they invested all of their points into intelligence haha
that s exactly what it is. this is going to be the biggest game of all time featuring trans character creation options. they are stirring the controversy and tricking the normal people into supporting the trans agenda  it s genius.
that s how nintendo got bayonetta 3 back into the spotlight  their marketing team paid the former voice actress to stage a boycott. it worked like a charm!
its possible but it s still risky could go either way   it has to be planned very well
there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. you make your peace with it the best you can or you live your life in pointless frustration.
exactly. it s not like i m not aware of the atrocities that help make life comfortable for me  but i don t try to excuse or justify it. i am taking responsibility and associated consequences for my choice to accept convenience and comfort at the cost of someone else s quality of life. it also helps that these conversations often get swept under the rug and not talked about  so it s so easy to pretend it s not happening.
@peterbu18  this is still by far the best system humans have ever created.  quit whining. it s weird
@johndodo2062  lol - i guess i didn t make myself clear - i m not whining  i am agreeing. i was implying that i may be wrong but i m not hypocritical like the people who sit on their high horse and tell others they are bad because of the products they buy.
i don t think people really care about the ethics of a corporation tbh  but now that they have started preaching how righteous they are it matters  especially when they preach how we should act and how bad we are.
facts
thanks i was banned in a discord for supporting hogwarts legacy!
@timmytimmymit5607  screw em  they are just angry they aren t getting their way.
easy
@timmytimmymit5607  im not ban i even promoted it
@timmytimmymit5607  screw that discord!
@timmytimmymit5607  give us the server name and we will attack them
true! gaming is all about meritocracy  which is antithetical to woke!
we really don t it s fantasy there s not supposed to be real world shit in games
your gonna get grandma points
pre order for myself  a growing a   woman who grow up with harry potter
@grayden4138  you know there is a thing called opinions and that s what i stated i m def not gatekeeping
@murtamp9828  and you re telling me this why exactly i m gay not trans
@timmytimmymit5607 then report the server for discrimination
the age old adage continues  any publicity is good publicity.
me about to preorder hogwarts legacy  i m about to get transphobic also me who already bought hogwarts legacy and ready to stream it  i am mega transphobic
you quoted mathew 6 1 and  eliza  practically exploded like a firework turning into a 500 meter tall led flashing sign  in my mind.
hey melonie keep being awesome...so glad i subscribed to your channel    its fun to watch
looks like the haters aren t going to get their way. this game should be a banger and i m getting excited for it. it s so awesome having a fellow christian who loves gaming talking about these things. great video as always and i hope you re doing well.
well done andrew tew !!!!!!! that makes me so much happier for preordering deluxe
i had every intention of getting the game and finally looked into it today.  i won t be getting it because of ---   incorporates 3rd-party drm  denuvo anti-tampering .  denuvo has trashed far too many games in the past.  several games have been ended  when denuvo was not taken out of the game  and they ended the server verification service  which ended the game for the user who bought it.  in this case  sixty bucks down the tubes.  if they remove denuvo  i ll reconsider.  j.k.rowling is a good writer.  a woke nut that wants her country over run with illegals they can t afford.  and extreme nutjobs attack her for something that is common sense.  her wokeness was not in the potter series.  if she writes another fantasy  i ll check it out.  end of story.still mostly pfft  but some boom is creeping back in  slow but sure.
just found you and your channel and i am looking forward to watching the rest of your videos.
dang  don t often see someone with the guts to drop a bible verse. thanks for the video.
i am 100  going to buy this game just to support them regardless if reviews are great or terrible.
i pre-ordered the deluxe version of the game yesterday! i have to wait until april since i got the ps4 version. and i can t wait to get my hands on the open world  interactive rpg where you have the option to be unforgivable and choose your own path in the wizarding world of hogwarts legacy!!! i just hope there will be more than one file slot so i can do more than one playthrough without having to delete my prior save.
you are right. these people don t actually believe in what they say  they only want it their way or the high way. they say it s about human rights... while violating human rights
i purchased out of spite  but decided it was a good buy just based on the limited sponsored gameplay. then like two days ago they had influencers release their 2 hour game play experience  seeing random  while limited  exploration and actual mission combat  i have now reached the hyped stage of game anticipation at the age of 40.
i remember when the brown paper wrapped edition of postal first came out. there was a boycott on that too. i bought it right off  was not dissapointed.
he trains my hands for battle my arms can bend a bow of bronze.you make your saving help my shield and your right hand sustains me your help has made me great.you provide a broad path for my feet so that my ankles do not give way.
i m waiting for acg to review it. he s one of of the few game reviewers i trust.
well done avalanche studios. it s a low bar  but thank you for not attacking the fans
i did not know about this  due to me avoiding hogwarts legacy so i don t get over hyped or spoiled. im going in with low expections so i can get wowed
i am a hufflepuff  and avalanche studios is allowing me to be. that s all i care about!   u melonie!
at best all we can do is call out the hypocrisy. wish we could call em out to fight.like what mike said  social media has made too many disrespectful people brave because they won t get punched for being like that. sad.
this is a character test  and you failed it.   unless there s something wrong with your character  in which case i succeeded.   d
also doesn t think it s needed to ask a cat for consent to pet it!!!
i have mine preordered and will pick it up on the 10th and already have it installed to my xbsx. also i read every book and seen every movie day one in the theater. love harry potter.
honestly i m just really thankful at this point i got another opportunity to stick it to these monsters yet again
i never thought of virtue signaling ad applying for that verse. great insight  good to check ourselves on that!. also agree there is a level of provision and and reward god provides for those who believe and those who don t   some things apply to both. great video!
the best part is this game is exceeding expectations so far.
melonie preach this i yearn for true gender equality. i have no patience for one who talks about female privilege when it suits them and then complains about someone  not being a man  when it s convenient!
i had already given you a like and now you re giving us a message! love it!
i just pre-ordered hogwarts legacy yesterday and can t wait to play it!
great video  thanks for all the hard work. just bought this for my daughter and gifted it to her on steam. digital deluxe edition.    chris
i don t have time to watch streams unfortunately  but i d catch up on vod if they are available. i d like to see how this game is.
good that you know of the scammers - and sorry that i sent you a message. hopefully  you didn t perceive this as intrusive.
i m pre ordering and streaming it once i learn how to do that
i m not really a harry potter fan and i wasn t originally going to buy this game but everyone keeps talking about it and what i ve seen so far looks like fun. showed it to a friend who is not a fan at all and he is waiting until next paycheck to get it. hope it lives up to expectations.
can t wait for the game to come out. i want to give my own opinion to the game not just what i hear.
i m surprised she hasn t came out against the game just to drive up sales
i find it so ridiculous that they try to boycott the game because of jkr. most people in real life don t care about her views or what twitter is saying. my boyfriend gifted me a steam deck and i will buy hogwarts legacy even if i try to not have too high expectations  the last hp game i played was the goblet of fire and that one was horrible .
don t even bother with the scammers  they re literally in every video comment section on every channel i watch.  people ought to be tech savvy enough to know to ignore them
everyone who enjoys h.p. lovecraft adaptations  relaxed chuckling
his response was phenomenal  and honestly a perfect response to ign s obvious push to get him to agree with the woke narrative. been a fan for a long time on twitter and for some reason i didn t know you had a youtube channel. that issue has been corrected. keep pushing the truth and avoiding the woke bs.
you being a  chaotic hufflepuff  is something i genuinely want to see in this game. like can you be the biggest demon in the world while being in the house most associated with jolly fat kids  lmao. then do the flip and be a saint while in slytherin.
i hope troy leavitt gets whatever bonuses he s entitled to from the sales of hogwarts legacy  especially if the games turns put as well as most think it will.
hi melonie and thanks for the offer but it always feels like its a scam. how about you tell me here what the reward is.
lovecraft fan here  i couldn t give less of a shit what people think of the media i enjoy. looks like real harry potter fans are standing with us in the  i don t give a shit  camp. in hp we stand
exactly!  they couldn t ban d d  doom or hpl back in the day  they re not going to stop harry potter.
man  i must be a terrible person - i preordered the game  and am looking forward to playing it  i believe that the right to bear arms is the single most fundamental human right  naturally  i carry .
i m glad the director said that the game developers would be getting the profits
can t wait to play this  it looks awesome. troons and their handmaidens can cry harder.
i haven t heard much about it but i ve mostly been ignoring the drama around the game. the game looks good that s all that matters.
day one purchase! love your channel!
the ironic part of this whole ordeal  this game will most likely be a best seller  and be in contention for goty
what s awesome is the fact that since it s a harry potter game it probably drove away a good chunk of the woke programmers  so that alone helped make the game good.
i love how most people i saw on social media said they don t care they just ordered the deluxe edition
melonie i m so sorry that you had to click an ign link. thank you for being a stronger person than me.
oh yeah we are bad people lol. hey melonie. that s a really cool necklace. is it a butterfly  hope your well.
you re not necessarily a bad person simply for playing the game  but i would say that if some sort of internet controversy sparked an ill spirited desire to wear the game as a badge to shove in peoples  faces about how intolerant  ignorant or arrogant you are  i d say maybe then you re still not necessarily a bad person  just a deprived individual who needs love.
i just hope the game acknowledges me as a woman or a man depending on the gender i choose to make my character. it really breaks the immersion if everyone in the game just refers to me as they or them.
love ur content keep up the great content
reading that comment from  not a scientist  at 6 43 perfectly sums up the whole thing.  i am against anything that doesn t impact my way of life .the moment something useful is in opposition to their way of life  it gets unquestioning support.
they wil never win from us.thank you for making these videos!
i take great satisfaction seeing some groups get so many at jk rowling and her making money on this game. i went to utah valley university a few semesters ago and asked why people feel the need to go after the finances of those they don t like. they said it s because those companies and people who have  bad  ideas could spread their ideals and incorrect knowledge to others  like a cancer. they were totally on board with financially ruining companies for having different ideals.
yep  scammers are every where. this happened 10 years ago too  but it was in people yt direct mail boxes. this is why you need mods to scrub your chat. even though the scam is blatantly obvious.
hey there beautiful i sure do look forward to seeing your vids every day!! i love the common sense mindset and unbiased approach
they don t know why they hate her  they were told to hate her.  tell me what she said that makes her a tr@nsphobe.  -  she s a tr@nsphobe.  -  that s not what i asked.
for future reference  it may become a real strategy for game developers to fake boycotts on their own games. these   massive boycotts  only gave free advertising to the game  increasing its exposure and pre-purchases by a massive amount.peoples usual response to saying you can t do this  it will make you a bad person is to say f u i m doing it now even if i wasn t before.edit  the vast majority of the people saying they will be boycotting this game were never going to play it in the first place  its easy to  sacrifice  something in the name of virtue when you have no interest in the thing you are  sacrificing .
i m bad to the bone!
would be best if they had pronoun options for he she they. they couldn t include every pronoun  or allow for custom ones  simply because the npcs in the game must refer to you by some pronoun  and ofc with custom they ll just be silent when addressing you  throwing off the immersion . but unfortunately  the pronouns are most likely tied to your sex or voice choices  most likely voice since they do want the game to be inclusive as possible for trans players  ie female but with masculine pronouns  so thus the masculine voice choice . if the npcs didn t actually have voices  custom pronouns could have easily worked  but with voiced games that will unfortunately never be possible unless you want to hear some super hilarious google translate rendition of custom pronouns from other languages too. personally  i d be super into that just to hear how hilarious it would sound
it s almost as if if bad people gain power that s bad  but nooo free market means you can t be judged.
my wife   friends   myself all have pre ordered the game.  looking forward to it!
all i have to say here is that your explanation that the the woke movement is satanic is absolutely spot on and makes me happy to hear you say cuz it is 100  true.
big props to this director but i wonder if he would say the same thing if his game wasnt already one of the best selling games in recent months and it hasnt even launched yet.
pre-ordered in december  can t wait to play.
i ve seen some of the boycott channels. they are threatening people and telling people they are worse than murderers for buying the game.
was always gonna buy the game  pissing off some awful people for doing so is a bonus
thanks for the clarification on the scammers.
alright that s a really good bible verse for this. you made very good points here. and i m looking forward to your chaotic hufflepuff play through stream.
whenever you gaze into the camera  your eyes literally cry for approval.
hey melonie! can t wait for this game  lol. i like that butterfly necklace
did you hear the story about the special forces soldier who went trans and decided to join mma that dude literally destroy that poor woman i feel so sorry for her
hey melonie for always keeping these topics most won t talk about them.i always enjoy listening too your topics thoughts.takecare melonie
i m still shocked with all the financial issues most seem to be having now a days  yet we also cannot wait to buy a game before knowing if it looks good  plays good  story-wise good why can t we be smarter about this  watch out for the game  wait till reviews from who you trust  then buy  why rush to give money  again. what if multiple missions   side missions are woke   but you already bought the game. too late  you funded it. ppl rushing to support a company rather than themselves. blows my mind.
team badger!!  i knew i liked you for a reason
so funny. truly funny how people going against this game can t come come up with actual good shit. no one will dictate what i buy and not buy. i have been pumped for this game! will definitely support it.
appreciate your content so much and god bless
excellent video as always
melanie i have a question...do you think we ll ever get a story in the following years that doesn t have to do with anything being -phobic  diverse or something else i m tired of all this wokeness.they need a dang nap
another example for the power point!
i find it amusing that these people think they can tell me what i can and can t do. i ve waited for this game since i was a child and nobody can or ever will stop me from enjoying it. but they don t understand the concept of enjoying something do they
@timmytimmymit5607  dude these crazy people on the internet today man... i m sorry to hear that happened to you
i ve started using their own methods against them. i ve made the point that rowling is a feminist and supports women s rights and protecting women  so they must be raging misogynists if they disagree with her.
but i guess keeping predatory men in wigs away from women s bathrooms isn t as important as saying that men menstruate.
couldn t agree more
projecting much

as long as it s a lever thet can pull they will keep pulling it.
there s plenty of stories like that if you re willing to look elsewhere towards foreign media like japanese anime  manga  and even games.if that s not your thing i don t know what to tell you tbh
i don t think they even enjoy ruining everyone else s fun. they can t help themselves  it s just a sad parasitic habit.
so if my hobby is kicking puppies  you can t stop me since i enjoy it  can you
@skwerben  it s more that the person who made the game is the one kicking puppies  so instead of you kicking puppies it s like you re paying someone to do it. it s not that you should feel bad  it s more that you should wait a bit before buying  since the first few weeks months are what really matters  and what the publishers kind of look forward to
@brianok9939  i m not going to get into some moral political debate over whether or not i should play a video game. you can believe what you want  say what you want and all that good stuff. your choice is yours and mine is mine. if you don t want to get it for whatever reason you have that s fine  i respect that. but i m playing the game  and i will enjoy getting lost in a world that brought me joy as a kid.
@brianok9939  so making a game is kicking puppies  that s a twisted mind you have.
@brianok9939  saying that biological sex is a real thing isn t the same thing as kicking puppies.
@nyxnightmare3542  that s not even what jk said one bit. lie better
@supernintenjoe8911  it s not that it isn t real  it s more that it doesn t really matter. society changes  it s what it has always done  and now it s changing how people can define themselves  and that s great! more power to them  but there are always people who will br stuck on the past  and since rowling is so influential  her saying those things is harmful. so yeah  although it s not kicking puppies  it s more like a simile
already bought it  not really much money for me and if it annoys whiny people then i m happy to support  plus i get what s looking like a brilliant game out of it.
@melonie i m curious. are u trying to create your own cult system  i really like the part of matthew   hallowed be thy name...  keep up the impressive work.
pre-ordered the deluxe edition for myself and each of my family members  and i m planning on buying more next week just because.avada kedavra  transfucks!
not gonna boycott.. this game is too good.
i can t wait to buy this game
my daughter last year was scared!! she said there was a man in her public washroom and he was talking to her.. now i have to wait in the doorway and get an all clear from my kid so she feels safe enough to use the washroom...
i m still gonna buy the game no matter what lol   just waiting till i get paid
you are not a bad person. you are melonie mac the waifu
if the game is 1 2 as good as it looks its going to be an easy 9 10
i quit playing games a while ago sad to say  but since when did we need permission from the people who made the game to play the game  and why would the people who make a game say people can t play the game  it s business you want people to purchase said game and play said game or you don t have a job  oh yeah they are purposefully ruining the industry that pays their bills cuz it makes so much sense in clown world. thanks for the great video like always miss mac
regarding hogwarts legacy  the game looks just like any other generic aaa title nowadays and it looks like this  controversy  ironically contributed to the game s premature popularity outside of potterheads circle.
thought the title said  stay mad hatters  at first
some reviewers have now played the game and every single one has had great things to say i really hope it gets goty just to rub salt in the wound
1 day i can buy hogwarts legacy   other badass games with potential  no poison being injected into them   providing good entertainment with no one lecturing you  but first i need to re-buy  re-collect   reconstruct my ps3 collection
i bought the game twice. i m a gemini.
well now i definitely wanna play
i really love your videos
i will buy the game if it is good. had enough of pre order scams. glad to see people are standing their ground against the trans groomers.
i m not a rowling fanboy  and i don t even play games but i will go ahead and buy a couple of copies.
virtue signaling is how a narcissist impersonates someone with a conscience
@brianok9939  stating the obvious a truth isn t harmful  and if people do  think it s harmful...then that is a reflection on how firmly they believe their  truth . just saying
@supernintenjoe8911  and what is this obvious  that gender exists  the problem is that jkr is diminishing trans people  not just that she says  gender .
@brianok9939  again  if her words diminish them...then they need to do some self reflection on their personal truth. not take it out on game developers like a horde of ravenous karens.
@supernintenjoe8911  personal truth that what  they matter  and i agree  personally attacking game devs is wrong  boycotting the game isn t. if this game gets boycotted devs will think twice about working with jkr  which is always a huge w
when can t us  gamers just enjoy a game without being bullied or harassed or being called a racist or sexist or homophobic or transphobic  etc it s like we live in bizarro world
there is no controversie about hogwarts legacy there is just twitter and some people who dont understand how this world works
i don t think anyone is happy that rowling will get a hefty amount of money from this games existence  but we cannot try and punish the game devs for making a game they want to make.
thank you for your take on this. i love people with a brain!
this dev literally gave a non answer to not offend anyone  yet definitely angling towards the jk haters. he bent the knee by about 1 4.
i m excited af to play hogwarts legacy and care not at all what anyone thinks about it.
is the game going to be goty  maybe  but it will definitely one of the best selling of the year.
my response was simply to preorder copies for the homies in addition to mine. i m sick of these people.
they want them to use words like  transgender  and  jk rowling  when talking about their game so there will be more  controversy  to write about  and then when they completely avoid those words because they just talk about the game  it s a  controversy  in of itself
wouldn t they care about bigger issues like child slavery   no because that would require them to actually care about children and their safety.
yeah! hufflepuffs unite! badger pride!
nailed it . i ll follow all your media
always a good day when mel breaks out the bible and hits some home truths!
if some people think me a bad person for playing a game  then i shall become their monster.
the people who complain about this game wouldn t be playing it anyway  so screw them. thanks you for covering this mel  best wishes.
speaking of hypocrisy  i find it hilarious how some people are threatening friendships with people who pre-order hogwart s legacy while they are streaming world of warcraft which is created maintained by blizzard. and we all know the drama around blizzard and their much worse antics lmao.
i already have the ps5 version pre-ordered  however i will also be getting the switch version coming out later in the year just so i can be nice and buy an extra copy that one of those freaks attempted to boycott.
remember what alfred  said in batman begins  some people just want to see the world burn!
the last of us2  normal people   attempt to boycott   insane loss of popularity and saleshogwards legacy  wokists   attempts to boycott   insane rise in popularity and sales
omg it looks so amazing! i wanna play!!!!!
she still getting paid none the less lol
he made trans characters possible  thus making a statistical reading impossible and checkmated them fully to stop their one keg they could stand on. the guys at avalanche are smart
eh. it s a response many japanese developers give.it s milquetoast but it s basically  we wish to develop a good game for everyone to enjoy  which is the best we re going to get
they ll be streaming hogwart s legacy too
god bless you melonie  and keep speaking the truth.
the game s sales blew up in spite of the controversy  not despite it. they better not bend the knee to the very people that are trying to make them fail irregardless of what they do.
saying men are men and women are women isn t controversial  it s the objective reality  and even if she did say something controversial i wouldn t really care. she could say the most horrible things imaginable and i would still buy this game  why  it s because words aren t violence  they re words and buying this game will do nothing but support the men and women who put blood  sweat and tears into this game.so can these vile narcissists please just go outside and actually find real meaning in their lives  i mean i know thats impossible but come on.
that s the problem with the game.  all i know about it is the controversy.  no game play videos are out there to watch about the current version of the game.  i will say this again   this game had better be an amazing game or everyone buying it out of support is going to hate having done so.
i pre-ordered hogwarts legacy as any decent person and good gamer should do.
honestly i d make a press release  thanks for the free advertising bitches    the mob opinion should be ridiculed at every opportunity
screw the boycott. now i ll buy the game whether i play it or not.
they already  bent the knee  when they put all the  diverse  gender options  and these people are still mad  lol.
great to see a woman that s not brainwashed by social programming
im the type of gamer that loves to point out all the luciferian etc symbolism in a game  out to everyone...so i obviously have no friends anymore.. xdanyways  im new to the channel  im surprised its hasnt popped up before the other week..but i suppose the algorithm tries to keep certain  like minds  separated lol
i pre ordered it yup game gonna be great
jk was only worried about natural born women and they all got mad for no reason at all. there was nothing wrong with what she said.
i m a brand new follower  thank you for standing up for this nonsense!
if playing this game gave me actual  hogwarts   i d still play it
a  boycott  is not real if the people  boycotting  wouldn t have bought the game anyway
i still miss  what is up my boomers !  and the daily verse. it just doesnt feel right without those bookends.
smart idea. ignore the haters.
the fact that the studio devs configured the character creator in such a way that lets gamers effectively create a non-binary trans character in the game tells me they are  at the very least  conscious of the controversy. so few games have gone to these lengths in character creation and none of them had this specific situation hanging over them. whether they intentionally set out to do this as a middle finger to her  or if they simply wanted to create an inclusive experience for all gamers irrespective of the controversy  who knows. you don t have to agree or disagree with her views to enjoy this game. she had no input on its development. just don t be a hypocrite and pirate it. either boycott it or buy it. don t screw the devs over who worked hard to make this game the likely hit it s going to be.
dang melonie  i followed you on twitter back about a year ago before i got permabanned--- i remember when you started that sleeve. it s coming along nicely!
i think it s hilarious they really thought they could control gamers and potter fans. this boycott was dead on arrival.
so words don t hurt !!   how dare you!!!
hundreds of videos came out yesterday from damn near every game reviewer.
no  never pre-order games.
me when my last pay came in take my money!
can t wait to play it.
the games should be the main thing in the gaming community.
you mean i didn t win an all expense paid vacation   they said i only had to pay the taxes and fees. hahaha don t forget to drink water.stay safe. take care. have fun.
i already have the game pre ordered the deluxe edition and cant wait until 7th feb to play coz i have 72 hrs early access
finally people working on something they want to make great. and it s gonna pay them big bucks. i predict highest selling game of 2023 10m-20m by 2024. they hit the jackpot and all they had to do was care about the source material and make it the best possible. i never pre order but this game was the first i broke that rule for. cause screw the woke mob.
my guess is that half the people who are  boycotting  the game are getting it day one and are just trying to keep there head above water.
the most chaotic hufflepuff the world has ever seen  ahaha
i miss the days where we would all talk about the new game coming out and it didn t have anyone s beliefs  politics  opinions. just whether the game is good or not.
i m gonna pre order a thousand copies
i accept your challenge for most chaotic hufflepuff.
i am so mad i can t afford to buy atm hogwards legasy! even if i wasn t a gamer i would buy it just because.
those who cancel online are the ones with the worst characters and most skeletons in their closets.
im a woman in a lesbian relationship and both me and her are going to play this game  d
people who call you a bad person well  they don t know you and can lick a pickel.  melonie is a good person and a blessing  she is awesome and i m glad that i am following her. like melonie said stay mad heters!! haha. lu
on one hand  sweet! melonie is a hufflepuff too! hufflepuff ftw! on the other hand  wtf! why am i like the only hufflepuff out there that doesn t wanna go genocide run as soon as they gain magic powers  xd i get my wife wanting to become the next dark lord  she s a slytherin. but jeez she keeps showing me tic tocs of hps talking about holding their wands sideways as they torture or outright end anyone who crosses them. who hurt you all   pnah but for real  i hope it s a good game and where the dark stuff is the least of my concerns  i hope everyone gets to enjoy it and have fun. would be nice to have a none politicized game both sides can talk to each other about again. people hating me because i m an hp and not because i m more conservative like back in the day. lol
i just had to pre-order this game.
one thing to remember is that this game is being  boycotted  by people that were never going to buy the game to begin with  so really nothing of value was lost. the numbers don t change at all. true potter fans are going to buy this game despite what some nutjob on twatter is trying to make them believe someone else said or thinks.
the sales are so high for an easy reason  these issues are not organic by any means.  they are pushed concepts by power brokers to garner in control.  the people whom you may come across whom buy into the idea and parrot it themselves are what are referred to as  useful idiots.   the idea is meant to drive divisions between people to insight anger mistrust and eventually acts which can come about naturally from  useful idiots  on either side of the equation engaging in destructive acts.  however if that doesn t come about naturally then agents will be put in the equation to force the actions.  some people know these events as  false flags   this doesn t mean the people the agents hurt and or kill are not real people as the ones pushing this could care less for any of our lives other than to have complete control of it.  real people often do get hurt or killed by these sickos.  they then exploit the chaos they have created to inact policy and new laws designed to further strip us of our freedoms.  which was the whole agenda from the get go.
i honestly don t care about jkr and her standpoints. she created a wonderful world that kept me dreaming my entire life and that s what really matters to me. me enjoying the books  the films and the upcoming game has nothing to do with supporting her mindset. and i think the creators of hogwarts legacy thought the same.even if jkr would be the most horrible person in the world it is still no crime to enjoy a fictional world that she has created. i think some people can t seperate the two things.
oh for sure! they pre ordered! especially the  allies  but even people who are trans and tweeting about how transphobic you are if you buy this game pre ordered the digital deluxe edition
facts  i just wanna play the game lmao and we gotta bring our religions into this shit lol
love your spiritual approach on these polarized ideas. there s not a more loving yet stern pov than a jesus based one.  5 appeal in my book
every streamer is gonna get canceled by playing this
from my favourite teacher. the moralists stand distant to law and order. for law and order can be recognized and fulfilled only by the strong  which in freedom take upon themselves knowledge and fulfillment. the strong are rooted in genuine being. the moralists camouflage themselves with appearance.
buy the game  or don t buy it  they need to stop throwing tantrums like impetuous brats. just let people enjoy a game or ignore it at their pleasure. if they do not like a person  don t like them  beyond that is just madness.
i may disagree with what you say on very few occasions but your overall outlook is on point and refreshing.
crazy world we are living in.
amen  sister go boom... thanks for checking them on their hypocritical righteousness...
i keep hoping they include a jk rowling mode that makes boys boys and girls girls
as if i needed another reason to buy the game
i m not into video games  but i will buy the game just to give the finger to cancel culture.!. and i m so happy we re at a turning point  namely  the woke movies and rebuts are failing miserably. i think is human nature to reject things that are being forced on them.
i have pre-order the hogwarts legacy on ps5  i really love the world of harry potter
i dunno  i might give you a run for your money in the  most chaotic hufflepuff  achievement
cant wait for this game   getting it on the ps5 and taking days off
nice 1 also dont cave in to haters while you are streaming the game
i find it funny the people who fight for no censorship  censor people
hey i like your points usually but could we get some documentation on the iphone child slave thing pretty big thing to just randomly reference
the wokelash made me pre-order so hard
the way i see it is that the ppl that play the game are the rebels and the ppl that are against the game are the dark side
this is me on the game i did my waiting  5 years of it i have been waiting for the game since it was leaked about 5 years ago  and i can t wait until the 7th.
i ve already pre ordered it i m playing this game!
just google it  this is common knowledge and not hard to find lol
i just bought a ps4 for my nephew just so i could have a reason to buy hogwarts legacy.
you can t spell ignorance without ign. i m sure ign wanted more controversy out of this.
if the director was smart they wouldnt have said anything
i wasn t even thinking about getting pig warts but now i have it pre ordered the boycott worked awesome first ever hairy potter purchase be woke your enemy gets rich
i got 3 copies don t care about the bs about the tran drama it still the number 1 game
i m still buying hogwarts legacy!!!
i have a half day at work so i can go get my copy and play it all weekend
i ll be downloading this twice on both platforms just to psi them off.
im supporting her pockets and her opinions common w s
hey dude  idk if you ll see this but i think if you had moderators somehow  they could help with deleting scam comments and banning those accounts.
to be honest  this boycott thing gave more popularly to this game and is one of the key reason why people are pre ordering this game.
i love your hair longer like it is that said why are they targeting a kids franchise with their crazy insane ideology
the studio already a while back officially distanced themselves from rowling and bent the knee by removing sex gender from the game s character creator.or maybe it wasnt bending the knee and they are actually fully onboard with the gender ideology
well i m gonna be the worst human being known through out man kinds history! because i m going to be doing multiple playthroughs to try each house. dx
i just found your channel and subscribed.
i dot care about hp. i ve not seen more than the first movie. and i ve never read the books. but will be buying the game  not only to make a point but also because the controversy showed me a game i d have otherwise not look at  and it looks fun. i feel a lot of people will be similar to me. woke shit is weakening  look at velma show for example  and people are tired of being bullied to hive mind think.
pre ordered can t wait
ya know  initially i wasn t planning to buy this game  simply because i ve never been into harry potter . but now after seeing all this fake outrage  i think i ll buy it just to piss them off. hell  make it 10 copies.
what boycott  lol. we are about to see the disonnance between the twitter noise and reallity. i m not a harry potter fan but the game looks amazing. a must buy.
great video i m also a hufflepuff
contact me for your reward
i was never a fan of harry potter. i grew up reading lotr and the chronicles of narnia. so  i m probably a bit too old when it came out. i never had any intention of purchasing it because i m not too interested.it seems so weird to me to not purchase something because the owner s  don t have the same beliefs as you. are we going to go through every creator to see what they believe so we can decide to purchase or not purchase the product  that seems ridiculous and exhausting.
oh i ll buy it 1000  and i ll buy it again.
i see you are a certified dog and cat lady! nice!
i played the old harry potter game on like original xbox or something  it was amazing to me. i probably won t be able to play this but the people that can and bitch about it are entitled af
and they ll wonder why everyone hates them
ign is mad they had to say the game is good. their bias is actually visible @ this point
can i just play hogwarts legacy i don t care who feelings hurt this one for harry potter in the voice
hey what about your tattoos  doesn t the bible say not to get those  i agree with you on this matter by the way. it s just when you start going down the christian route and it just pops into my mind. keep up the great vids.
why ppl be attacking poor patrick for living under the rock..
i m living under a rock and i still heard about this.
i m going to be in gryffindor because my favorite character was in gryffindor the most underrated character in the series neville longbottom
yo e visto game plays si bien no se ve tan mal digamos que a n siento que no es un juego tal como lo prometieron las batallas se ven muy malas  la inteligencia artificial est  muy pobre  este juego saldr   super mal ya que se siente vac o   ojal  antes de su salida arreglen eso por que sino ser  el peor fracaso
as a gay man i m buying this. i ve recently had some very negative reactions from the transgender community online and offline. i was watching a trans woman on tiktok doing her makeup   told her she looked gorgeous  she did . i asked if i could ask a question and she agreed. i asked her if as a man was she gay and was she considered a straight female now   i felt it was an innocent enough question and i wanted clarification on how it all worked with the labels  and she blewee up at me along with all her followers. i was transphobic  terf  whatever that is . i know many in the lgbt community feel that the angry trans community has sort of commandeered the t part of lbgt  because  let s face it  we re all lumped under one umbrella  and the things the angry ones do  like the ones boycotting a game  make us all look bad.
did you ever see norm macdonald dressing down a comedian contestant because he was making fun of jk rowling  macdonald corrected him by stating that the comedian should have done his homework because rowling herself has stated that there is a strong christian underpinning to her work. that s what  they  are really attacking.  you will be hated for my sake
i don t check twitter so i m happy with  living under a rock honestly lmao.
dont care what people saying about hogwarts most everyone from youtubers to regular people love this game and i am definitely buying the deluxe edition for ps5
think ill buy the game now!
i don t even play video games anymore  and i m thinking of ordering a copy just because the woke mob doesn t want me to.
we just made a game  is a good response. thanks for the free publicity  would have been a better one
so youtube is not doing anything about the scammers  youtubers themselves have to get in there and manually deal with it. they will go out of their way to faq people over but they wont invest anything into dealing with this.
that s the point. woke mobs are like bullies. you bend the knees to bullies once  you ll have to do it over and over again and it s never enough. you satisfy woke mobs once  they will push further and ask for more. it s always the case with bullies.
i pre-ordered the digital deluxe edition of hogwarts legacy. i m taking a big wizz on that certain group of people that doesn t want this game to be released. they can have my middle finger!
somebody should make a game of irreversible damage by abigail shrier.
all they ve accomplished is giving this game millions of dollars worth of free advertising. honestly before all this went off  i thought the game was already out. i m not a huge hp fan  so i have no interest in this game. the morons hating on rowling have brought it more attention from people like me than it ever would have gotten otherwise.
i love being a bad person if that means i get to play this game
a hufflepuff!  say it ain t so!for me  it has always been ravenclaw.
i got my pre order. i guess i m a bad person...... but i never said i was good either.
im still buying it. this is an experience ive wanted since i was 8yrs old in the late 90s. im not letting a bunch of twitter clowns and snowflakes ruin this for me. they can f ck right off. the only people these boycotters hurt are the hardworking developers who put their heart and soul into this amazing experience for us. they are all pathetic.i have the collectors edition pre ordered for my ps4 pro and couldn t be any happier.do i agree with jkrs opinions and decisions she made over the years  no. but im still forever thankful to her for helping to make my childhood as magical as it was with this wonderful timeless series.
lol  ...look at me i m agreeing with a feminist  right now.  i feel like were in an upside-down world.   you and me both all of a sudden bill maher and i have a lot more in common than i ever would have thought 6 years ago. i pre-ordered hogwarts legacy at full price which i hardly ever do.  i felt i had to back the developer regardless of how i feel about jk rowlings comments.
its funny how almost every hogwarts article ign does that brings up j.k. but when it comes to how to click on their affilate links so they get some kickback when you buy the game...that whole page did no mention her once....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm strange....
wokesters remind me of my chihuahua  barking at the wind  barking at passing cars  barking at the washing machine  barking at the dryer....it amounts to nothing more than noise.
they are trying to normalize shitty and selfish behavior. not being a religious person myself i am going to have to agree with you on that. i find it disgusting when people self glorify.
if you buy the game  you re a bad person! yeah  well you re going to tell us we re bad people anyway  so what difference does it make
any thing that drives the woke fools crazy has my 100  support.  don t care for this genre of game much  but absolutely buying.
rowling went boom.
same deal with m m s wikipedia   in 2019  mars announced that they couldn t guarantee that their chocolate products were free from child slave labor  as they could trace only 24  of their purchasing back to the farm level  see below . the washington post noted that the commitment taken in 2001 to eradicate such practices within 4 years had not been kept  neither at the due deadline of 2005  nor within the revised deadlines of 2008 and 2010  and that the result was not likely to be achieved for 2020 either. 84
i will play the shit out of that game!!
i support the developers of hogwarts legacy and i m a supporter of lgbtq my wife is a woman but is demisexual and thinks the game is amazing looking. i finally came out as a demisexual male so i m still a man but i m only attracted to someone who i feel a connection with which is my wife. i m a christian also but i still support the lgbtq community because i was raised to not judge based on someone s sexuality. can t wait to play hogwarts legacy love your video keep it up melanie mac
jkr could kill someone and i would still think she is awesome. i got the deluxe edition
fluffy lil dog my sister has one like this. i like cats myself. omg in the background did you actually purchase that lara croft romance doll   psst i have all 3 fire emblem fates on single 3ds cart . on my golden majoras mask 3ds  fantastic game i like turns based strategy  xcom etc.
gay.
@sizzlordtheexiled3886  what do you mean
woksters should hire themselves out to game developers to boycott the next game about to be released. they could charge a nice premium for boosting sales. being woke can t pay that well  so maybe they could use the cash
i hate preorders in general  but i bought this game. hope it s good.
i don t even like harry potter that much and i might buy this game.
you re awesome!
i ll cast my vote with my money .. and rowling gets mine in both counts. how about this for a new spell  wokeisridiculous-suh !
i m buying it and i m not even a potter fanboy.  the movies were fun but the game looks great.
their bark is worst than their bite if they have any . when these people learn this and stop cowtowing to these lunatics they ll slowly go away
the more i ve been called a transphobe  the more i ve embraced it. if  toxic masculinity  were a thing  it would certainly be something present in trans  women . people only started having a problem with them when they started trying to control people s speech and got more involved with children.
i knew decades before j.k. rowling put pen-to-paper i was a bad person so this reminder is meaningless to me and will not change my mind about looking forward to playing hogwarts legacy
i m glad he didn t bend the knee.
i plan to binge watch the films then play the game. don t really care for the politics of it all just enjoy the world and stories.
go  team hufflepuff!!!!!
and a bible verse at the end! love it!
i pre-ordered deluxe edition as soon as this boycott started  - a pissed gamer who always waits for reviews
you re exactly right
luv ya mel. carry on.
i ll be playing it  if playing a specific game makes me a bad person  well then so be it.
her take is basically 90  lefty! on the post that i believe started it all  i literally only agree with 1 out of her 6 points  yet somehow jk rowling and i are on the  same side
i may miss you playthrough because i will be playing as well. i promise i don t bite.
i am a bad person and i haven t even played the game yet.
i m not even a potter fan but this makes me want to buy the game and play as the whitest  most male character i can make in the player customizer
i bought the deluxe for both xbox and steam lol
the same people calling j k rowling a horrible person and buying this game supports her are the same people who have no problem with mindy kaling and her making money from velma. this isn t about any kind of so called phobia. this is purely about control.
personally  i care about more important things then these woke cult mentality  like example. why don t we have a morality system  romance system  and online  co-op would love to go to a server or game and play with friends from xbox  pc  and playstation. maybe do raids or whatever  i mean even in the movies harry didn t do everything alone  or by him self he had friends. what a shame i can t abuse my friends online by throwing them around like a raggdoll lmaoooo
i m going to say this again like when the cancel culture first became a thing....they don t and i repeat do not have any problems....if they can t make these companies money which clearly is the case...once again velma lmao....
amen and good call on matthew 6 1. it s not surprising  though  that they do this. the devil disguises himself as an angel of light and his minions do the same. by their fruits ye shall know them.
i will be the baddest wizard this february 10
i m getting the game idgaf about a boycotter s opinion.  loved harry potter as a kid even though people used to call me harry potter  and yeah  i agree with her position anyways
i m not a christian  but  performative righteousness  is a perfect description of the woke mentality.
in the game will we be able to feed the ducks
i can  unless extreme  can separate the art from the artist... sad more people can t
the cast of the harry potter movies also telling people not to play hogwarts legacy and i m like dude that s just you people being dictators
i love your perspective on this issue  i personally don t agree with feminism but i have no choice but to agree with jk rowling on this issue since the alternative is women getting taken advantage of to trans men.
hogwarts legacy s transgender options are simply the latest example of the evolution of video game character creation.a recent bloomberg report revealed that the upcoming harry potter universe game hogwarts legacy will offer transgender character creation options by not associating the game s  witch  and  wizard  designations with the player character s voice  body type  and other customizable attributes. the reveal of this intended feature drew controversy from some gamers who threw out the usual complaints   sjw    pr move    virtue signaling   blah  blah  etc.  etc.   but the bulk of the controversy in this instance dates back to anti-transgender comments made by harry potter author j.k. rowling. those comments once seemingly prompted warner bros. and hogwarts legacy developer avalanche software to clarify that rowling has no real substantial creative input in the development of the game.
i can t believe the world we re living in
love it
never bend the knee to the insane
if you won t buy a game based simply on one individual s ideology  then what is the real problem  i don t think it s the game or the person  but more likely involves you and your wwjd bracelet.
you know what kinda sucks... when the  woke   canceled culture  started gaining ground i was so pumped that people were finally fed up with people getting away with making allowing garbage to be made and we were gonna get better content. instead  we got extremists using this to tell the consumers they are bigots. i wanted better games and media  not a wave of sjw yelling about someone s personal opinion and saying i m a terrible person for not being  woke
already preordered! stay mad  ill be playing hogwarts
imagine if the woke mob put all that effort into actually helping the trans community instead of being so focused on harming j.k. rowling. maybe then they would finally realize they re not helping anyone by making sure everyone else is boycotting this game.
buy hogwarts legacy let s show those 3 people on twitter we will never bow to them ever!
serious question  since google doesn t give me a clear answer and every trans person dodges the conversation or do the same  what on god s green earth did j.k rowling actually say that is triggering ppl to call her  transphobic   each time i ask a trans person  i m like  what did she say specifically  and it s always  idk exactly but it was basically hate speech
velma is the number 2 show in the world and hog warts is the number 1 game.   if i was a salesman i d do whatever i could to make either an aweful show or get someone to run out and do some fake bigotry.   please god do a boycott on my products!   lol
don t let the muggles get ya down.
nice to see more sane gamers standing up to the woke crap. i never pre order games. but i m tempted to this time.
hogwarts baby. lets go!
if the collectors edition wasn t 300 bucks i d get it. as is i m getting the deluxe. was on the fence until these malignant turds tried boycotting. here s hoping the reboot is decent.
oh  and i pre-ordered the game
she makes me really want tattoos even more than i already do. can never decide on what to get smh.
you missed male prisoners going into a female prison and getting female inmates pregnant!
i just want to tell you that you shared a wonderful and great bible verse for today melonie. also i just wanted to tell you that you have to dodge some haters often when they are not sure what they are really talking about and just want to be a part of the conversation with this topic or other conversation with you and your friends and others  ok melonie. anyway the hogwarts director has to dodge those haters and go through their lives and make some money to make this video game to sell out to the companies that want to sell this video game to people like me and you and everyone else who wants to buy this game to play at their homes with their friends or by themselves  ok melonie. anyway i just want to tell you that and i just want to make a comment on this video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you have had a great morning this morning and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed afternoon and day at home and at the gym if you do go to the gym today but if not then have a great day at home melonie. also god bless you too melonie.
these people who ve started the boycott just feel like they ve done something meaningful and progressive when really they re just wasting their times. in the end they re just providing free marketing for the game  cranking up the sales numbers
i ve said it before but i feel i should again if you try to cancel or stifle someone or a product than you are not oppressed but are in fact the oppressor
i love how a video game is the hill some people die on. hundred years ago  it was human rights  values  or self preservation. no. now it s video games  and which bathroom you choose to use.
just got my digital deluxe pre-order... those woke-sters can go pound sand.
even a broken clock is correct twice a day and  on this matter  j.k. rowling is 100  correct with her concerns over women only spaces.
if the game developer goes full crazy woke at this point i can definitely cancel my purchase.
their boycott will be soundly beaten out by the buycott.  people boycotting this weren t going to buy it in the first place.
no one  and i mean no one  is actually boycotting this game. the group of individuals who have an issue with all this is such a small minority that it literally doesn t hit the radar of real people. in fact  you don t have to live under a rock to not know what you re talking about because honestly  i have hurd more about this controversy from channels like yours and yellow flash and quartering than anywhere els. at the end of the day  it s not main media information.  it s back door small minority of people and articals no one reads. in fact  i ll argue you yellow flash quartering and others similar to you guy are covering this more than literally everyone else almost like it s so small it don t exist in the grand scheme of things.
i think she said she regretted the tattoos. i might have misunderstood. it was related to her religion
@heinzerbrew  i wouldn t be surprised since she found her religion again. but i think it s hard to take a book too seriously. as long as you re a good person i think tattoos and things like that don t really matter all that much. besides hardcore christian s and stuff judging you  it s not a big deal.
@nate6795  a womb fertility tattoo
@pyroflare7774  i would get the opposite prolly
nothing is ever enough  not even sacrificing you mortal soul. and for what  nothing. because something else disagreed with will cost you everything.
you know  hl got all this free publicity because the activists decided to talk about it  had they shut up it would have been at best a moderate success.   in fact i ll go as far as to say that all the activists had to do to insure  hl failed  was shut up.  the conspiracy inclined among us could say this was a 5d chess move on the dev s side to insure success of the game  doubtful  but we can say for sure they will be riding this success train till the last stop. i mean it s a free ride and hopefully they will realize by the end that the people they were trying to pander to are not the fans they should have marketed to.
all very well said
i bought deluxe edition only because of that loony left hysteria. so you can thanks them for additional sale
most chaotic hufflepuff   that s not very hufflepuff of you
can you call it a boycott if the game is the number one seller on all platforms
keep bringing the word. meanwhile  it is not shocking to see you agree with common sense feminism. it s the insane  useless parts of it that are dumb.
yes i am mad. i m mad because harry potter has a open world rpg game  instead of the lord of the ring.
these same people that call jk transphobic also call blaire white transphobic even though blaire is trans and has said the same thing as jk
the same people complaining about this are the same people that think ezra miller is stunning and brave
it s a shame they really don t care about biological women and children
i m team hufflepuff too
i m not interested in the ip whatsoever. i almost bought it out of support anyways. however then i remembered this is a warner bros. product. and  well  i don t support their products anymore. not after what they did to henry cavill  johnny depp  dc overall and keep doing with ezra miller and amber heard. at least for the time being.anyways  this game seems to be doing good. makes me happy for actual fans of the ip.
to be honest i would like to play hogwarts legacy i just don t the extra 70 dollars to buy it on my ps5 don t know why the hell it is more expensive then 4 but ok
jk is a respectable feminist  people forget she s from england and i wouldn t don t they actually have equality problems there unlike america where all that stuff is literally history
im just watching the marshmallow walking around the carpet.
the only reason i m uninterested is because i personally grew out of the hp franchise  not because of inclusion
my wife and i bought 2 copies lol
i feel bad for people that spend their valuable time wasted on sprinkling hate   if i was a streamer i d play the game   i m def to haters   i ll do and play what i want and feel like  can t live for everyone   my finally thought on this.... keep it pushing
the  woke  crowd are seeking validation for their actions and words.
thank you so much!
well if they did then surely they d have a problem with biological men competing in women s sports  women s beauty pageants  entering women s bathrooms and dressing rooms  etc...
id follow you on twister  had i not been perma-banned afrer my 2nd tweet years ago.
i really wish this game didn t have denuv-oh-no in it.
when i get this game im going full slitherin on y all asses  dark gang unite!!!
all of it is just satirical now  used to be that if you didn t like the opinions you simply don t buy it or you ignored it and moved on. now everyone is trying to push their individual world views on everyone which is laughably satirical because no one was promised the world that doesn t even exist. for example  i loved ender s game but i don t agree with orson scott card so i just ignore the man but still enjoy his books because his world views is insignificant in the end  no opinions and viewpoints lasts forever and in 200 years will have never existed. people needs to know that they are not the creators but consumes the contents created for them so they have no say in any of it  otherwise they all would have a rude awakening when people starts telling them how to make their contents according to their viewpoints.
i love that you read from the bible
as soon as you dont bend the knee you take away all power they have. pretty simple.
the magical effect of  effectus streisandus  is beautiful to see. the more the wokies whine  the more people will buy the game.
hey melonie i sent you my credit card number  a scan of my passport and my fingerprints to the telegram you said but i still haven t recieved my price
so i have a question about  woke  versus  representation . nowadays there is a strong knee jerk reaction to anything that appears  woke . how do people make the disctinction for example  star trek the original series could be considered very  woke . a black woman as an officer  an asian  first interracial kiss. the list goes on. however it s regarded as more forward thinking and i ve never heard tos called  woke .another example  bsg race and gender swapped a bunch of major characters. there were complaints before the show aired but afterward it is mostly regarded as one of the best sci-fi series in that last twenty ish years. the changes were acceptable and the story was good up until the end.so are people able to distinguish between  go woke get broke  and  representation for the win   how do other people feel about it
so if i understood this  right  jk rowling is not known for saying nice things  but she basically said that while she is not against people who are lgbtq etc.  the is not supporting it either  aka she is not against it but not with it  and this stirred up the narrative or her being phobic and hateful  thus the attempt of boycotting harry potter related stuff  which failed as we can see.well now  it won t stop me from buying what i want  and moral complications are everywhere  no matter what you buy in this day and age. listening to others who tell you what you should and should not do or buy  you are basically becoming their b  ch to put it bluntly...also  while i am personally a dude that says  live your live the way you want it   basically idc who you wanna be who you are or what you love as long as you are happy  i am not a fan of the people who deny simple biology and known facts. in the world there are two genders  both required to reproduce  and with the current technology you can undergo treatment and surgery all you want  if it makes you feel so much better  go for it  but there is no way you can change your born gender with it.
boycott  lol i m still buying it because of the boycott. i pre-ordered two copies.
the fact that a notorious woke person is beeing attacked and called a turf simply for disagreeing with one of the woke viewpoints meanwhile she agress with a ton of woke views is hillarious  just shows what an excluding hatefull clownshow this whole movement actually is when you dig a little deeper than surface level.
i wish i could ve got the super duper deluxe edition
its been brought up before  but supporting the new star wars jedi survival game supports ea  and one of its largest investors is mohammad bin salman  the crown prince of saudi arabia.  last time i checked he  and his country  aren t big fans of lgbt.  will we be seeing a boycott of jedi survival doubt it.
your comments on wokeism  being satanic are actually pretty on point. i dabbled in that kind of thing briefly when i was young  mercifully briefly  and because of that i can go ahead and vouch that yes  laveyan satanism is what i call the  church of the self.   placing yourself on a pedestal above all other things and seeking affirmation from everything everybody but him is not how we were created to be  and it s sad that people have lost track of that truth. matthew hit things on the head pretty accurately  imo.  btw  miss melonie  have you watched  the chosen   if you have  what do you think
hahah look at that little cute dog in the background!
i ll be enjoying hogwarts legacy 3 days early on steam. unless stupid denuvo wrecks the quality...then i ll be miffed.
i will buy it as soon as available.  f the haters
a lot of people that s online for both not just twitter  but just any social media platform  youtube included  that are out there  being in such a rage over someone else having a different opinion than yours  a lot of that energy would be better channeled  combating actual murder  child and sex trafficking and any form of slavery that still exists in other parts of the world. a persons opinions on gays and trans people should not be something comparable as needing such outrage to the other things i mentioned.
it s not much of a controversy considering just about everyone thinks the whole thing is dumb. jk rowling is entitled to her opinion. if you disagree with her well  that s your privilege but i don t see why any of this should impact this video game.
star trek tos was optimistically and aspirationally  woke  and people liked it regardless of that due to how well written and acted it was. current year woke is very pessimistic and  mask off  since the progressive leadership of our countries presided over decline and broken promises of integration. now they are scapegoating white people openly. the current cultural reactosphere on yt are mostly 90s liberals who are naively onboard with the tos message  they just want to get back to that or similar. but that kind of civil rights ideal is a lie and doesn t pan out.
awesome video good job i in joy it
what would make me laugh is if the game got even bigger in sales due to all trans mob blowing it up in their faces
i said this in another of your videos  but i had no drive to buy this game. i m not really understanding what the woke community is upset about
in addition to the passage you read2 timothy 4 3for the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. instead  to suit their own desires  they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
ima be honest. i don t give af about none of this shit still copping hl and going to have a grandiose time playing it.
w you w hogwarts legacy w god w jesus christ
seeing that i m a rather conservative person and i hold christian views and values  i m pretty sure these insane weirdos think i m already a horrible person  whether i play this game or not. might as well play it anyway.
here is your daily reminder that hogwarts is woke af
geez these weirdos have no consideration of the staff members who worked their ass off making this great game and also need to make a living. i still remember how blitzschung got disqualified from the tournament by activision blizzard for angering the chinese govt for showing support for the protestors in hong kong during 2019. does it mean everyone has to boycott the game company for this reason  my point i m trying to make it is the situation is complex for everyone to be all politically aligned in certain situation. i personally believe the violation of human rights under a tyrannical society with population of 1.4 billion population and the invasion of ukraine weigh than this endless loop of   ism  in a society where everyone is entitled to their opinion expression. the people in china cannot even have a say or have the capacity to even think critically. some ukrainians fighting for their liberty may never be able see tomorrow
hah! i was just thinking that iphone thing before you showed your post. which brought to mind  thou hypocrite  first cast out the beam out of thine own eye  and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother s eye.  -- matthew 7 5
while never always agreed with rowling...her trying to meddle in scottiah indy ref for example but in the case of here comments on trans people there was nothing hateful. she has right to her free speech and voice opinion too. how this is being leveraged to try and boycott a game is absurd
you re a hufflepuff  melanie..cool. i m a ravenclaw
hopefully it is a good game  rather than like forspoken  which is unfortunately horribly written.
bought the game and doubled down by getting the most expensive edition. can t wait to stream it to give the middle finger to the woke idiots lmao
game studio caring about a good product    bigots!!!
i was just going to do the normal edition. but ever sense these grown adult children started crying about this game. i upgraded to the deluxe edition. don t worry snowflakes i ll be playing the game sooner.
team hufflepuff let s go
yesterday i was banned from bethesda s twitch chat for asking why you can t play as a white person in redfallthe playable characters are black  asian  and 2 spanish. could have easily made one of them white. the game is taking place on the whitest islands in america. this was clearly a choice. i m not opposed to inclusion  but this is clearly exclusion
funny  i thought that journalist were supposed to be objective. but its clear that this article had a tone and a slant that the writer was trying to bait out of the director. i wouldn t be surprised if the writer of the article is in fact trans or something else which makes it an immediate conflict of interest. hes not gonna say  yeah she made the ip but but f--k her. yeah  sorry wokies thats not how marketing works.
i still can t think of more peak modern internet discourse than jk rowling treatment  she really got jesus treatment by those people  been nice and polite from what i seen while being turn into enemy of the state. especially since she is one of those literally few self made people to reach such status. maybe smear on jordan peterson  who definitely did awful grifter thing in regards to russia invasion and his framing of it  i m not following the guy that much but the smear on the guy is still just insane  putting him among the likes of tate. maybe i m wrong oo n the second thing but jk rowling thing should be a historical moment for the books.
it s funny how all these activist types will howl about rowling s  anti-transgender views  without ever specifically mentioning what she  said  or honestly discussing the issues she s been responding to over the last few years.
i think i want to play it now didn t really care to play till i heard all this bs
ok so it s anti-woke to like it. just making sure. i m gonna go buy a copy on each console. thanks for clarifying. i do t even like hogwarts or know what it is. but if it pisses off a woke person  that is money well spent
i am very pro trans rights but even i am pretty tired with the  boycott  sentiments and the hate. the game itself has nothing to do with the topic at any capacity save for the author of the books that started this universe may have said some things and holds certain view points. that s the not the developer or anyone working on the game and any talk of royalties going to rowling for her ip... she already got fat stacks from literally so much other hp stuff  the royalties from this game are not gonna tip any scales. besides the last page of character creation even lets you choose if you identify as a witch or wizard  and if i am not mistaken  that is not tied to your character frame. you could make a trans witch wizard thanks to the developers.
do you know how many people will by this game   even thought normally they would not buy a game like this rpg... not my cup of tea  however i will be buying it. so the co will get a big boost of sales off people like me. bet there be a lot....
let s not talk about the fact that this whole group of people are using the term  transphobic  wrong. phobia means fear. nobody is fearful of trans people...at all. and just because someone has a difference of views does not mean they are fearful. so  let s get educated...and use speech correctly. p.s. i enjoy your videos.
guess you just got a subscriber.
if desiring the protection of women is bigotry or transphobia then i m a proud bigot transphobe  and shame on those  non bigots  who support the harming of women.
i don t get the idea of trying to get someone that doesn t agree with your views fired  like what s that going to do  you re just creating more homelessness. and it s stupid that employers fall so quickly to fire them to appease people.  what does all this help
there is no real boycott its all hot air
i think the woke types will find out that the majority of people agree with jk rowling s pro-woman stance and this game will be a best seller....
im a transwoman and no way im not going to play hl. bought the deluxe edition
has recently reinvented herself as one of the most prominent anti-trans voices in the cultural gestalt ign  your gaslighting is showing.
bring back troy leavitt.
i was gonna subscribe until you said  hufflepuff   any house but that one.  although  the in-game house does look amazing
hogwarts legacy goty . plays best on xbox series play anywhere p.c
seeking acceptance from your peers is not virtuous. a christian in fact does the opposite  because we tell the truth regardless of how unlikable we may become.
there is a name for people who try to force other people in to their way of thinking..........
i will not be buying hogwarts legacy mainly because it s not my type of game and i have never really been a potter fan  that said if someone wants to buy and play the game they should be free to do so without fear of abuse from a tiny tiny section of people. these  trans  warriors should just mind there own damn business.
i m done with ign.
why do so many people care  literally play the game or dont. imagine letting politics judge everything you do or cloud your interests simply because of stuff they said. i went on twitter for the meme of it and saw a dude comforting his  boyfriend  because his boyfriend was  traumatized  he watched rick and morty when that dude had the allegations come out. these people are absolutely ridiculous.
as a satanist  i don t really like that anything evil is called  satanic .  you know what the satanic tenets are  no satanist worships or even believes in the christian satan. i. one should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.ii. the struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.iii. one s body is inviolable  subject to one s own will alone.iv. the freedoms of others should be respected  including the freedom to offend. to willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one s own.v. beliefs should conform to one s best scientific understanding of the world. one should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one s beliefs.vi. people are fallible. if one makes a mistake  one should do one s best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.vii. every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. the spirit of compassion  wisdom  and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.
j k rowling rules
what s funny is that jk rowling actually publically supports trans people and trans rights. the fact that the community is so mad at her and villifies her over speaking about biology  something that real transgenders like  blaire white    buck angel  and  the offensive tranny  can and will acknowledge. blaire acknowledges that she was born as a man.the irony is that if  biology isn t real   then what s the point in trans-itioning to the opposite sex if indeed   male  and  female  don t exist  it s wild how quickly their logic crumbles under itself.
as the god of war.. i m buying hogwarts
isn t this like you telling a black person if something is or is not anti black  or me telling you what is or isn t harmful to women  in what scenario is a cp going to stop because they aren t allowed in a bathroom  seems like your just using it to justify an anti trans bias. or am i mistaken  are you supportive of trans people  do you use gender affirming language because studies show it s an easy way to reduce self harm  and why are you expecting other people to live life based on your interpretation of a text for a religion they may or may not be a part of
political gluttons can stay mad  it s about the creation  not the creator at the end of the day and i m glad they re keeping it as is
maybe it is because i live in a small village in germany  might be the nearest thing to  under a rock   but i do not understand why we even talk about a small minority who is raging on twitter. i mean cmon. a so called shitstorm on twitter is not what  the people  think. it is a small  angry  minority which is basically just loud on a social media plattform. ignore  em and enjoy this wonderful game.
it s all a marketing campaign. 4d chess
i get those scammers and my channel is small they are way more common then people think
i m buying the game because of this nonsense.. not just the game  but the bonus edition!
youtubers need to start showing we people the many many anti straight tweets from these same people.
i didn t think i won that ps5 lmao that didn t exist
screw them haters they will try their best 2 cancel the game but they will not succeed!
never try and appease an aggressor. the only thing it does is make them more aggressive. they will never be satisfied.
im streaming this day one
bending the knee on something selling this well would be such a dumb move.
all she said was the truth  i you have a problem with the truth  then you are the problem.
it s amazing how the yt algo bot can read into a single comment and determine it is hate speech but can t filter 10 000x spam bot messages with foreign ascii codes and all going to telegram. even the most pathetic junior dev could filter out that shit so there is no excuse.
i guess in a bad person since i ll be playing it tuesday on the ps5
stay mad  i m not pandering to satanists. satanists worship themselves  which is exactly what satan wants you to do. he doesn t care if you directly serve him  just as long as you aren t serving god.
@meloniemacgoboom  you nailed it  melonie. never bend the knee to the enemy or his children. always demonstrate through the way you live the hope that is in jesus. satan s a dead end to selfish  amoral self-destruction.
@meloniemacgoboom   satanists don t worship themselves. i m sorry you misunderstand anything about them
weird name
random observation  that looks like a bichon frise in the bg.
melonie mac the fran drescher of youtube
im going to play a game if its fun  noone should tell me what to do and judge me for purchasing a game. kinda silly
that comment from sheep doghis name is very fitting
they should push an update to put male or female as the only choices just to drive the point home.
i m a bad person!! i ll own up to it  i like good games.
how do you ask out a youtuber edit  melonie  would you like to kick it with me sometime
don t want to alarm you but  there s a large  shaggy white rat running around in your room there.
we just want to make vidya.
if it is bad  then i don t want to be good.  go kick rocks woke jokes.
i m a gay man and i think this hole  your trans phobic if you play this game   is rubbish   it s got nothing to do with the trans community it s just a game   i didn t think of jk rowling at all just thought wow this looks epic
theres one thing i cant stand more than anything  and thats hypocrites. all these ppl have been nothing but massive hypocrites
shoutout to samsung galaxy melonie knows i m just surprised she doesn t have a galaxy z flip

melonie is quite pretty.
we re inclusive ... but if we disagree with anything that you say  you will be excluded.
these people preach freedom of speech but only if you agree with them smh
dont turn around but im sure theres a dog behind you cuute

samsung master race!
its past time the boycott freaks are ignored .
i agree about the hypocrisy. there are bigger issues around the world that you can be boycotting. look at the quagmire that the disney china relationship right now
one steips two steipss three stripes  yes exactly
melanie so cute
let s be real. the people who are trying to  boycott  this game never intended to buy or play it to begin with. they re just a bunch of foolish activists with a chip on their shoulder  sticking their collective noses into anything and everything for some relevancey and clout.
i am a gamer and i am a rock.
how do i send my children to the phone mines

why would real gamers know about a kids game and twitter
monday i order deluxe edition why bend a knee to like 3000 people at most who probably wouldn t. have played the game anyhow. over the milions who would play  it anyways
i understand the association with harry potter  however the game is called hogwarts legacy. hp has nothing to do with the game to begin with
you have an owl tattoo. owls are cool
being woke does not make someone sin
how come websites aren t putting up disclaimers about wwe 2k23 with vince mcmahon paying 20 million in the last 6 months for multiple sexual harassment and rape lawsuits
please show me on this doll where the bad video game hurted you.  i will help me to ensure that it gets you all.
i absolutely cant stand when you say   if you dont know  youve been living under a rock.  not everyone cares as much as you do. love the videos tho  keep up the good fight.
is that hp s owl on your forearm
take your pick.  they-them  the holy trinity or  they-them  legion   for we are many!
samsung might not be made with child labor but its still made with slave labor.. also them clothes though lmao

it isn t righteousness if you do it for everyone to see ya
i m going to build megumin and cast explosioooooooooooooooon!!!!!!
i added telegram just to troll them back.
i just wish the steam version didn t have denuvo. because i don t buy any game with denuvo. i got nothing against the game itself  or j.k. rowling  but denuvo... i got loads of issues with denuvo.
i wish they leave the game alone and let people play what they want which is hogwarts legacy.
the scammers in the comment section are this site s robocall annoyance.
biology has always been real.  s.
i have to get around doing my video on this... but it s so dumb. if you want to boycott something  fine. good on you. follow you heart. stand on your principles. et cetera. but why be mad at the rest of us  the majority of us  who don t care about your boycott    it s because they want us to join in their misery. if they can t enjoy the game  then no one should. i will play this game even harder. and your virtue signal is just that performative.  ps i was typing this before melonie made the same point. haha!!!
not from harry potter  i just like owls haha
i wanted the game at first  but maybe 2-3 month after release  but i have buy a deluxe prebuy of the game when i saw the dumb drama coming from woke people who cant stand j k to told them the truth   haha  i don t know if the game will be that good  its an open world   it should be fun anyway  but making this hated by those woke trash is a plus for me xd
why is there only a male female option in the character select  isn t there like 8 genders now
sorry i ve been too busy playing the last of us video game and watching the tv show and don t give a shit about people thought about hogwarts legacy these heater won t stop us gamer whatever don t really care i m going to buy the game and play it i want to learn the dark magic evil power hahahahahaha
i saw a brief segment of this crap on fox news today it was funny how the made fun of the woke in regards to this boycott
someday people will realize terf is logically just a good thing.
well i guess i must be the scum-of-the-earth because i m still getting this game regardless of the situation surrounded this game. ain t nobody s going to twist my arm to not play a game that i think looks fun i don t give a rat s ass of what people think or there feelings about it because it is i m getting the deluxe edition out of spite just to piss them off why  because i can.
first it was equal rights. now they want everything to be about them.
thanks!
awww whats the name of that beautiful pup walking near you

this is ridiculous
lol you look like my english teacher it s like she is teaching me here
thank you so much!
buying sry lol
once someone brings the bible in  i m out haha
most of the stuff they need for hightech comes from china. around 90 . or look what was in qatar. so yeah they are hypocrits. because especially if it s about trans rights  you would expect them to boycott quatar. but they boycott this game far more. both is entertainment. but quatar is part of a group they like. most people there.for them hl is more important  because it s right before their doorstep. people will talk about it. that will trigger memories. j.k.r. they hate her. they are easily offended. they can t take anything. they are weak. they are insecure. so this game is far more important for them. it s not about human rights. it never was. it s about having their own safespaces everywhere in western countries. and getting everything they want for free  just because who they are. because they are  opressed . and others have to pay for their needs. they don t care. so they choose a group with a lot of money  older white men  who worked their whole life  so they have some money. same tactic as germany before 1945. germany was nearly broke all the time. the german forces atracked norway mainly for money and ressources. i am here in germany  and what we had  started around 1920. it was far less extreme at the start. after 6 years they tried to take over. but they achieved it after 13 years. and they managed to cause a public climate  where it became more and more common to hate jews. 1938 were official laws. and people usually get interested in politics maybe with around 10 or later. so young adults mostly knew that. and 1945 we had a whole generation with this ideology. i say that  because people forget all the time  it took a while. the first years it was newspapers. it was about feelings. mocking. pretty much like  male tears  for example. then education. groups gor students. groups for older children. later it affected science. medicine first. literatur  books. art. entertainment. they painted certain stereotypes in movies. it was abou money and jealousy. and it went slow. so if you would say  the woke movement started 2011  you could say  the mid 20 s would be like 1933  or the late 20 s would be like 1938. so if you compare it  what happens atm  it wouldn t even be slower or better. same tactics  but it s in a lot of countries. the  cancel culture  too  btw. and in germany a lot of the people who did it were very insecure  too. a lot of the leaders were beta-males. it s known that they hated it and had serious issues. and the history is a huge topic  and people didn t take it seriously until 1933. they said  they could handle that ez. in 2 months we are pressing h. into the corner until he squeaks.that s what they said  franz von papen  with his plan to controll him  right before he took over. von papen wanted to use him. to be vize chancellor  while his ally has the ministry for economics  so officially h rules  but effectivly von papen and his allies. they did it because they feared communism and had to choose. so they used h. and thought they could controll him to prevent the communists from taking over. they laughed right until the end. shortly after he took over  it wasn t allowed to group up in public anymore. protests and things like that. and it s a huge and very interesting topic  what exactly happened  but you could compare it to today. i know people saying  they are glad to be that old now  so they don t have to see again  what happend in their childhood. that s just very concerning. and i just hope  that it s about far more people now  about a huge part of the population  about white men  not something like max 10  in europe  makes the difference. even if i also have in mind  communists and democrats overall were affected too  and they were powerful. they were more  but far less extreme in terms of means  and after a while  there were a lot of young people  who just knew this ideology. like i said  it took some time imo they totally are the fuel that could burn down the western world. again...
the people saying this need to get off the internet and go touch grass because  they don t know real-life
i d support the people making games over the insane lunatics that is the t portion of the alphabet.
don t listen to the dark wizards and witches.
what s the song it the end.
scammers  so if you didn t send me this ps5  then who did
that fact that today  a transgender that raped women  has been sentanced to a male prison has made my day.
it s not really a controversy it s just people trying to act holier than thou about their idea that somehow men can become women and women can become men but all they want is control over people and their pocketbooks it seems to me it s really stupid there is more important things in this life to worry about a video game
wait does this mean i didn t win a ps5
oh you mean those telegram giveaway scams i have been getting lately. yours is not the first channel i have seen this on. they are all over youtube now.
hello!you can t see me  but i am headbanging right now!
we have waited for a game like this since the first book came put.the woke mob could no more cancel this game then they could stop complaining.the woke mob is pathetic i am with j.k. on trans stuff.stand firm people this world has gone to hell and a hand basket it is more important to stand for what you beleive in no matter what then ever.
yea esv!
8 15 - typical consumer take
my copy comes in3 days early
i have one finger for those that want to boycott the game. you can guess which one that would be.
i m glad i ve always been a samsung person
i have pre order the game
thank you so much!
@meloniemacgoboom  you are wecome!
the game director already bent the knee and added identity politics in the character creation section of the hogwarts game. the game dev company is trying to play both sides of the conversation. its sad that you are acting blind to it.
i can t wait to play it don t care about the political bull
hufflepuff 4 life
huff! huff! puff!
i m buying it to support the developers and jk. nothing she said was wrong. a women is a woman ffs
me here. i live under a rock.
i don t get this nonsense sounded like people are bore and want something to get mad about. that what this sounded like me.
boy do they cott.
f    controversy everything is contreversial these days
slytherin!!
the woke mob and antifa are sitting in their parents basement rn pissed af
j.k. said nothing wrong.
why not boycott universal too  or hasbro for making hp stuff
slytherin all the way
it s gotten out of control ..it doesn t matter whether you agree or disagree with jk rowlings ..she gave an opinion ..i have cerebral palsy just  because someone says an opinion on desabled people that i don t agree  with..that doesn t give me the right  to say..no one can associate with anything with that person..that s some authoritarian stuff..that s also not the way to win people over ..i bought the game already..and im playing it..and i would tell anyone..get the game ..this crazy people will move on to something else..because in reality..it s not about  jk rowling or this game..its about seeing how far they can go with this cancel thing  ..its about control
fuck the politics  i don t pre-order games. end of story.
i live well because of atrocities i do not wish to know about. what separates me from the woke mob is i am perfectly okay with knowing that bad thing happen in order for me to have a good life. i do not virtue signal because i have no place to judge. we are all just trying to survive  and if i happened to be born more fortunate than most  but far less fortunate than some  that is my place in society. i didn t build the damn thing  i do not crack the whip or cage the children. if the powers that be do  and i profit from it without my knowing  or with my knowing but inability to realistically change it  then so be it.yes  i would rain hell upon all that do evil  even at my own expense  should i be handed supreme power to mold the world in my image  but that is not reality. that is high fantasy. and i live in the real world. and in the real world  one person s loss is another person s gain. my goal in life is to limit the evil done by my own hand  and evil done by those in my presence. i will leave judgement of all other matters to whatever god may be and the people of this world in charge of determining such things.
if activitvision  ubisoft  blizzard or riot games isn t being boycotted by these folk hating on the game then i find the point mute
they worship colin kaepernick  he s made millions from nike

all of the anti-j.k. rowling rhetoric is  as peak trans would say   bollocks .
this people need to be silence   everyone is tired of is constant complains  they need let people be free and stop crying for everything
i like my rock
i wonder  what do bikers against child abuse have to say about woke
this story progresses...  you mean beating up women is wrong   color me shocked!  i feel like i barely have time to keep up with work and personal endeavours  not sure how people have time to spend their whole days researching other people s past
i have opinions...guess im a terrible person.
satan get thee behind mac daddy
woke people should just be honest  and say it s because jk might just vote for trump
what is the issue  exactly   seems like a bunch of nonsense to me.  i can be annoyed  anyone can be annoyed.  i really don t think everyone should think the way i do
beautiful and smart
it s not a bigoted take. don t give them legitimacy. own it. have your opinion. don t enable mental disorders as the norm.
they did bend knee eventually by pulling that trans character in the game even though the game did just fine within this  controversy . cowards.
harry potter is one of the largest franchises created in this century... do these nobodies think they can stop all of us  by making us feel bad about trans blah blah. the game literally allows you to be anything you want. make a female wizard or a male witch with whichever voice. these same people argue that they don t get to do what they want  well stop trying to keep others from doing what we want and piss off.
i am so tired of people that  aren t cellbrain able to just accept that opinions are opinions and not reality  that what a person is  what a person says and what a person does aren t the same and that people like rowling and what she creates aren t reliable by anything like opinions but by passionate people working hard together to add things to her creation. sigh. this game has nothing to do with the indignation about the opinion of one person in the world. god damn. please be smart and kind as you want the world to be with you if you want that back to you. jeez.
we also see virtue signaling in acts 5 1-11 when two people bragged about giving everything to the church when they hadnt. god did not take to kindly to that.
lol  upside down world
i m buying this game  but you re a religious fanatic
what world we living in! i ve never seen myself defending a feminist from a mob
can t wait for this game  who cares what the woke muppets say.
668 neighbor of the beast.
the author of this article is chatgpt ekheh
it seems to me that youre the one mad lol how many videos do you need to make to feel better about yourself
simple solution... instead of the prictures with men and female on restroom doors just write  with penis  and  no penis  on it... done... problem solved  no one can complain anymore... well they can... i just don t give a fuck...
what boycott lol everyone i k ow wants this or are getting it lol
i ve also been getting those fake replies to my comments. just report it as spam.
i m glad they hated on this game release  i didn t know it was about to come out without them. i was able to pre-order the deluxe edition and get the pre-release extras xd. trans folks can go back to playing with what they cut off lmao
i am not even a massive fan of harry potter...shit i wouldn t call myself a fan at all  but this game just looks to suck to pass up! i m buying two copies. one as a hard copy to keep unopened to collect and the other digital to play! let these people cry  fuck em!
why is it that such a small and supposedly oppressed group of people.need to be the main point of the conversation regardless of what the conversation is about.every topic of conversation starts with trans and works its way out.not seeing the oppression
she needs to find a real job. people nowadays just want to stay home and make money  making ridiculous videos.
what are you a game show host a somethin   dial it back a notch
ok you say that but what about the message i got about a giveaway for your telegram   yeah nice try there melonie.  its not like people can just make their name the same as yours on the interwebs.  ok   the internet isnt a dumptruck alright   its a series of tubes.
or human trafficking maybe do something there w oke people
wait so the woke people won t be playing it  heck yeah let s support the crap out of hogwarts legacy
girl you should really reduce the facecam size. i can barely see whats on the screen behind you.
satan is woke.
i m buy game and going stream game hype for it big . us small streamer i m need us much exposure us much us possibly
i have no interest to play this even if its good or bad. play it and enjoy it if you want or don t. im not your game guru.
aw dammit i was with it till the bible thumping came out.
i m a super bigot because i pre ordered it thrice.
i was a game show host for about ten years so  yeah lol
@meloniemacgoboom  sorry i asked
the trans refer themselfs as   they or them  while talking of one person it s the same thing that legion said to jesus . he was one man who could not be chained he said this to jesus .   we are legion for we are many   he sees himself as this  many in one . the trans community does the same
i bought this game cuz i m a bigot that likes harry potter
these people aren t even gamers. so who cares about what they think.
every copy of the game sold hurts a trans person ok then give me 10 copies
there s a boycott  now  can we focus on the crowded hospital emergency rooms full of all the trans people who have been hurt by this game
woke games are broke games.
you re such a desperate pickme  there can only be one shoeonhead.
i read you can have  custom pronouns.    i think i might go hit ler or chm mao.       fwiw  being pro-woman and recognizing that women and children should be protected from men who think they re women doesn t make you transphobic.
the same in islam! if you do good deeds to be praised by man on earth than you have received your reward. but if you do good for god he will reward you in the next life.
while the lgbtq ultra folks hate the game for shit reasons i will be making the geneva convention an after thought in hogwart s legacy
i was with ya until you brought in the bible.
so anyone who doesn t agree with a persons religious beliefs are hateful against them  sorry but not buying into gender ideology isn t hateful or phobic or wrong.
not to mention trans women want to be treated like actual women but hate on jkrowling because shes an avid feminist. idk man seems pretty stupid...
not gonna lie love your content but i keep getting this vibe you re trying to imitate sniperwolfs personality
progressives hate this game  makes me want to buy it.
you re losing me at the iphone child slavery thing. where is your source url for this  wokees make outlandish statements without any sources or citations and i really dont want to find that you re being a hypocrite here  in a video calling other people hypocrites keep in kind that the woke throw a fit when asked for evidence.
samsung all the way! but don t agree wit the religious gash. go boom!
strangei mean i am christian but you took harry potter. a franchise about witches to flex all about christianity i mean yeah i m a christian but super weird flex to be like so this video is all about a witch franchise now let me talk about how amazing christianity is!i mean you realize what witches comes from right  just weirdest flex i ve ever seen. it would be like sjws are trying to cancel halloween. an innocent sweet family friendly holiday. now let me tell you how amazing christianity is and irs like wait what...
telling the truth is not transphobia.
actually got deluxe edition just because of those trans people screaming . because the game has nothing to do with their rights  its for fans and gamers.
cry harder
our personalities are completely different  what you smoking   i m not imitating or trying to be anyone  i m talking to a camera just as i would have a conversation with a person in my normal life. i ve been making content years before she did
it s fiction  not real witches. if you feel convicted watching  reading  playing it then don t  but other people can figure that out for themselves.
@melonie mac go boom  i said it was strange not offensive or problematic its jsut a bit odd harry potter is fiction irs a book series about witches. my entire point was praising harry potter while making a point about christianity and how satanic people arewhile praising harry potter a franchise using witches which originates from satanic followers irs just what s the word. ironic  i m not mad so if you think i am ok cool you do youi just thought it was ironic and strange i am aware harry potter is fictional but how it depicts witches entirely originates from the satanic witches right down to them having black cats black hats and riding on broomspersonally i love harry potter. i m not mad i just found it a bit strange and ironic
@meloniemacgoboom  i m a christian too. and my dad was my pastor growing up. and he watches the harry potter movies all the time. because he knows it s not real.
what about  is a deflection. child slavery is an issue. transphobia is also an issue.
matthew 5 17-20king james version17 think not that i am come to destroy the law  or the prophets  i am not come to destroy  but to fulfil.18 for verily i say unto you  till heaven and earth pass  one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law  till all be fulfilled.19 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments  and shall teach men so  he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven  but whosoever shall do and teach them  the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.20 for i say unto you  that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees  ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. jesus did not come to destroy the mosaic law.  he came to fulfill it.  what part of the mosaic law is fulfilled so that we no longer need to observe it  because jesus fulfilled it  kjv  hebrews 9 8the holy ghost this signifying  that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest  while as the first tabernacle was yet standing  9which was a figure for the time then present  in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices  that could not make him that did the service perfect  as pertaining to the conscience  10which stood only in meats and drinks  and divers washings  and carnal ordinances  imposed on them until the time of reformation. 11but christ being come an high priest of good things to come  by a greater and more perfect tabernacle  not made with hands  that is to say  not of this building   the part of the mosaic law which jesus fulfilled were the meats and drinks given as sacrifices pointing to the once for all times sacrifice jesus made for us  divers washings which represented our sins being washed clean  and carnal ordinances which pointed out that we are all flawed and unclean which meant we need a savior. kjv  galatians 4 9 but now  after that ye have known god  or rather are known of god  how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements  whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage 10 ye observe days  and months  and times  and years.11 i am afraid of you  lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain.12 brethren  i beseech you  be as i am  for i am as ye are  ye have not injured me at all. the apostle paul explained that the  holy days  pointed to christ  including the sabbath.  we were to rest on the sabbath because in order to be saved we must rest on christ  and not on our works. so what mosaic laws must we still abide in  not for salvation  but to please god   all of the laws that apply to morality.  such as the following kjv  deuteronomy 22 5 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man  neither shall a man put on a woman s garment  for all that do so are abomination unto the lord thy god.
w girl fr
i m completely against trans gender nonsense! protect our women and their rights that they worked so hard to get!
bought the deluxe twice one for me one for my girlfriend. can t wait to play it soon.   also trans-women are not real women  their men pretending to be women.
no such thing as transphobia
boom
i m all for equal rights and equal fights so why not make a trans female and trans male sport categories   like they can compete and it ll be fair   and the game getting flak for her views is pathetic freedom of speech no matter how bad and how toxic is still free speech whether you agree or disagree like people can have opinions and by trying to cancel people don t you then become the problem   uno reverse card tactics
men are men. women are women. hogwarts legacy looks like an awesome game. woke boycotts always backfire anyway.
i have no issues with rowlings but to be honest  this game looks generic is hell.
sorry too much bible talk not enought talk about the game
the game is filled with woke propaganda.
i was with you until you start saying satanic. give me a break.
you almost earned a sub ..then you pulled out the bible   the bible also preaches and promotes abortion murder xenophobia and slaveryso ..yknow .
transphobe  what a compliment.
while i watch these videos  the bible thumping is cringy as fuck. leviticus 19 28   you shall not make gashes in your flesh for the dead  or incise any marks on yourselves.  1 timothy 2 1   let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. but i suffer not a woman to teach  nor to usurp authority over the man  but to be in silence. hypocrisy what
nope cancelled my pre order.   any game that lets you pet animals and not have a button to ask said animal for consent is not progressive and you shouldn t support that either
you re quoting 1 form of fantasy  the bible  to defend another form of fantasy  hogwarts game  against the woke whatever-it-is  this video is a pile of gibberish...
educate yourself about child labour and apple because you re talking nonsense.iphones are not made by children.
anti trans views    rational thinking
@khornechampion8219 it looks like a slightly more generic ubisoft game.
i have right to my religion odin the true god.
you realize that the bible is one of the most geographically  archaeologically and historically accurate books on record... right the book of acts alone has nearly 100 historically verified facts recorded within its pages alone. acts was written by luke  the same luke who wrote the gospel of luke. even secular academicians rate luke as a first rate historian.so if luke labored to include such accurate details in his writings  why would he undercut the veracity of his work by including fictional details that could easily be disproven but again  even secular historians agree on the historical accuracy of luke s accounts.you re free to disbelieve the bible  but don t go calling it  fantasy.  it s a complete word that is historically  geographically  and prophetically accurate to the letter. it stands in a class all its own. the qur an or the hindu vedas could never compare to it.and the god of the bible will absolutely open your eyes to his truth if you would so let him.
j.k rowling is a transphobe.
you don t gotta sell the game to me even more man  i already pre-ordered it.
and god bless her for standing up for the protection of women and children.
looking at jkr s posts she clearly says she knows and loves the trans community  she s been empathetic towards them for decades. where is the hate  back in june 6th 2020 she even said   i respect every trans person s right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them. i d march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans. how is jkr transphobe  i think what s hateful is how the leftists deal with jkr s posts with false accusations.
if you knew what phobia meant then you d know that it s a rational feeling and not based on hatred.
ok.
