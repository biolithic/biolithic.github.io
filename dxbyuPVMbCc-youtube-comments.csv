anybody remember when neil tricked everybody about joel having a larger role in the last of us part 2  this is no different.
i m sure they re going to frame it as some sort of  -phobic  reaction as a defense for their deception.
this was handled just fine in the original game.  bill s sexuality was subtlety implied and was not a major part of the plot.  but it s 2023 now  so of course his gay relationship needs to be an entire episode of the show.
the show had the first gay person in history on the show. it was the first time a homosexual was spotted since 1924 in a thai villiage. so much progress.
the thing that bugged me the most is that they took out the school section with the battery and then they took out the part where they had to push start the truck when then zombies were chasing you. all of that was replaced with a romance story. it was out of place and doesn t align with what is going on.
100 percent agree about seeing intimate scenes in shows it is always so uncomfortable to watch
it s very progressive to force your desires onto someone else.
yes thank you for speaking out on this! i don t like full on intimate scenes either! it doesn t matter the gender! it s uncomfortable and awkward as hell so i consciously avoid them!
i had the same reaction that melonie had to house of dragons but with euphoria. two of my friends kept saying how good the show was but i saw one episode and i felt like i needed a shower. the fact that the characters were also supposed to be teenagers made it even more uncomfortable. i really wish these shows would ease up on the sex  it s just too much. i don t mind it in the occasional show where the fact that two characters are intimate because it plays into the plot but that s not what they re doing. it s just there to keep the viewer watching.
i don t like any gratuitous sex scene  but i m even less interested in a couple dudes in an intimate sex scene. call me whatever  it s still gross to me and no amount of shaming changes that.
i thought it sucked that we did missed out in ellie   bill s interaction they had during the game which was one of the more entertaining parts.
my favorite part is when bill loses his all manliness after the kiss. omg! i couldn t believe what the heck was going on. they didn t only dedicate a whole episode to something unimportant but also removed the story from the game that people actually loved. i can t unsee how bill just starts acting like a    after the kiss.
the fact that they had to resort to deception to draw people in speaks volumes.
funny enough  i didn t feel tricked  but instead  felt more like  i can t believe they waited till episode 3 .
guy openly admits to tricking audience. audience celebrates him still
you and synthetic man are the only ones who addressed this for some reason.  the amount of people pretending this show is some masterpiece is so bizarre to me.
i have had several friends were singing the praises of the show until  episode 3 my friend convinced his mother to watch the show and later messaged him and said  thanks for wasting 1 hour and 15 minutes of my life  when she watched the 3rd episode.
and everyone got all up in arms when we both called this out. that this was going to happen. it feels good to be right. also i agree with you melonie. i don t feel comfortable watching xxx scenes either in anything. which is why i intentionally avoid things like that when watching movies or shows or skip them. this was just vile of the director.
my new favorite joel moment was when the firefly walks up to him and says  if you get lost in the dark.  and before he finishes joel straight up says  tell me to look for the light and i ll break your jaw.  that s badass on a new level
after what they did with the false advertising that the last of us part 2 was a joel and ellie focus story  this does not surprise me.
exactly that s how they have to move as they know people would of not watched or played it
he had to of said that because he can t just spoil it.many games have altered trailers and e3 demos to keep spoilers hidden yet people whine as if tlou2 was the first to do it.
@chandllerburse737  yeah  well  they weren t as flagrant  were they
@mikecasino7296  i mean batman arkham knight literally showed gameplay without the joker while also claiming many times that joker would not be in the game and even some people were sick of him being in the series as a big character and then there he was everywhere of course it was a nice surprise for me and some.but thats basically the same thing the only difference is that people didn t like that joel died of course people will sometimes also say no that isn t it. its how he died and even somepeople will say no its him dying and how they try to make his killer sympathetic which i know people aren t always lying there but still.i can t say i liked his death either but the series always tried to present itself as more grounded and real and like there was actual stakes.unlike nd previous titles i guess.and in all honesty i just don t get the heavy praise for the first game that caused most of the heavy backlash anyways for part 2.its a good game but its not amazing its best support is story and a great or amazing game needs more than that.its gameplay is average and i am someone who doesn t hate that and replays many average gameplay games but still its how i see it.
tlou2 is what broke my trust in western games. i was so close to pre-ordering it  but i m glad i decided not to and waited for the reviews to come out  saved me my time and my money from buying that garbage.
@shaikanwolf8  why pre order anything ive been tempted to pre order a lot of things that werent really worth it despite not being bad games.i even once tried to but apparently did it wrong it was some time ago and i just got the normal game not a pre order.i almost pre ordered dying light 2 and that game was a bigger disappointment than i would say last of us 2 was but i had higher expectations for that and i never valued the last of us series as much as so many others did.
how !  they never made it seem like bill had a larger role in the show
typical npc behavior  responding with the same lines every time without failure.
yeah  they already are.
@batman0  that actually made me laugh out loud! i didn t even think about that  but it s a perfect description.
too late. if you say anything negative about episode 3 the angry twitter mob will come after you calling you a homophobe and such
people are like if you dont like it its considered weird and homophobic.
tbh i have seen a lot of those reactions from people online. it was a beautiful episode that gave us inside who bill was as a man. if people want a carbon copy of the game  just play the damn game.
@verbon47  oh look another npc
@verbon47  you re too far gone  my friend.
@verbon47  way more  it was beautiful and powerful  and completely overreacting. two old dudes ate a couple of meals  grew some strawberries  played piano than one got sick in a really contrived way  they both got fake married before killing themselves  it was like an oscar bait movie.
@verbon47  it just wasn t my cup of tea.. glad i got the heads up and avoided watching it..
@verbon47  or make an original show that doesn t rely on an existing ip  therefore people won t have expectations. just a thought.
@verbon47
@nightmarezero8465  so because i have a different opinion the a lot of you that means automatically   npc   or   too far gone   was the sex scene unnesecary  absolutely. they are akward to watch just like in got. but other then that it gave you a good insight of who bill was as a man. you have your opinion  i have mine. nothing wrong with that.
like hollyweird always does. what s with this rainbow agenda of theirs
gay or not  i really don t want to be tricked into a romantic plot when i m watching a zombie survival series. that goes with any ip  not just tlou. if i wanted to watch a romantic plot  i would seek out something that was intended to be so.
nick offerman already has.
so  are you afraid of being called names  embrace it. tell them  yes  i am  so what  what are you gonna do  .boom. they ll never bother anymore. it s past tims for you people to wake up and get on offense. stop defending yourself.
@verbon47  doesn t have to be a carbon copy to follow the game s event. doesn t even have to do it exactly the same way.the problem is that they removed a whole portion   replaced it with a kind of a throw-away episode. not saying it was bad  but could ve done without
@weatherreport2011  first and for most your weren t baited it was said from the start the third episode was going to be about bill and franks relationship.
not even that  but they completely cut all the scenes and dialouge with bill interacting with joel and ellie.
so an irrelevant side plot that lends nothing to the overall story. got it  storytelling sure has taken a dive.
let s delete the important scenes that people loved in the game and add some garbage to which the whole episode is dedicated and people don t even like to watch on tv proved time and time again. wow! very intelligent people.
are you really that surprised  if the original series didn t have this plot  they would ve inserted it... since it already has  they just maximize it.
subtlety doesn t exist anymore in entertainment. it must be explicit and in your face because they believe the viewer is stupid
exactly thats what i have a problem with. and for whatever reason its apparently weird or makes you homophobic to not like that.
i honestly thot it was a good episode  it s the first time i ve managed to watch anything like that without grossing out  altho i did squint thru parts
genuinely do you people want a carbon copy of the game  because you might aswell play the game then.
yea. i was totally confused as to what i was watching because i didn t remember any gay people in the game until ellie and joel found the letter and i realized that i watched the backstory of bill and frank. we would ve done just fine without that whole episode or at least they didn t have to add them being intimate.
@leeeverett1  they did that are they nuts where is the monsters that kills stuff like this to make it more interesting
they took two lines from the game and made 70 minutes of activism.  it s forced and not natural to the integrity of this story.
umm no it doesn t they did the same shit the watchmen series did where cut to a scene where some dude is taking backshots like wtf except this more clean but a whole episode   nah wasn t in the game and needed at all this was slimey
@redberries8039  stop it we didnt wanna see it and didnt need cus it wasnt in the game and they both die what we wanted was bill and ellie goin bk and forth
@brytex4life  i understand. i haven t played the game  but i get it  having recently suffered halo series which was trash and wrong
@pinkchu  you must not have searched any of the houses or gotten the meaning of the  grizzly  magazine in the truck. bill was very obviously gay by the end of that section.and that was ok  the story was well told and subtle. this episode was a virtue signal
subtly
@nick amalfitano exactly right. it was in the game it just wasn t in the players face about it it was a read between the lines thing with the letters bill had written to frank. didn t have to be a genius to work it out the whole  favour  that bill owed joel must ve really flew over their head s if they didn t realise bill was gay i d like to know what they think that favour that bill owed joel was for and why bill and joel were so cagey about it  i bet their minds blown now
@amayville77  and i thought illuminati conspiracy theories were bad  but this is an absolute nightmare.
@seph2686  i am quite okay with that in the game  but only  and only because it was an m rated game. but in the show  they were just pushing it. gross.
@redberries8039  play da game bro you have no idea what you re missin . its a spiritual successor to manhunt games on ps2
for me the biggest problem it s that with that episode contradicts the theme of the story wich was a grim theme even in the second game and giving it a they lived and died happily ever after was to romantic for the last of us they could have made the same story and at the end giving it what sometime a lot of relationships end with them hating each other like in the game and more because the story tells you that bill is someone stubborn on his way of life they began to drift apart and with frank dying away from bill also that would have give the story one of the best interactions that was bill and ellie bickering it was a good episode but it could have been better and with the theme of the show
@seph2686  joel didn t do any gay stuff with bill. that is your fan fiction.
or they could have left it out entirely. or they could have made the storyline make it clear that they weren t joined-at-the-hip. or  frank  could have been a nickname for  frances   or  francesca    making  frank  a woman.compromise and acceptance has gotten us where we are today  and i m not compromising any more  and my tolerance is nearing an end  as well.
@hiraghm  he was gay in game. deal with it.
@georgiabulldog7671  i know your snowflakes can t follow subtext but bill being gay in the game was a a joke  a gag. it was a way for ellie to make fun of himthis episode was a completely change of the game and it was just a waste of time. for those of us who don t want to watch two dudes making out it was moments to skip
@ogilviem  you are very naive then. unbelievably naive.

can def tell who is gay in these comments...lol
@brytex4life  i m kinda old now. i might start gaming again  perhaps in vr  but i m going to need games without too much shooting and pace ...dunno what tho
@brytex4life  i have been watching the lous cutscenes tho  and enjoyed them
@redberries8039  bro it dont matter how old you are. and games without shooting  i mean you can metro exodus its slow as shit but has shooting
@amayville77  if there can be non subtle romances between heterosexual people  why not homosexual people
@brian.jrmontoya3227  because it didn t exist in the game
@brytex4life  i played atari in the 70 s up to half-life and mass effect which i loved. i need a slow pace now    mostly story. i ve been waiting for some kind of change in the gameplay that makes games like interactive movies  they are getting there.
@redberries8039  they already are there. play journey or the last uncharted game. tbh those are the most boring to me i like being more hands on than watching cinematic movies or having my hand held through a game. but to each his own
@brytex4life  i ll take a look at them  cheers
@amayville77  gonna need a better reason than that. castlevania has a lot of shit that wasn t in the game as an adaptation  and a lot of it worked well.
@brian.jrmontoya3227  doesn t make it a good adaptation then.
yall so lil minded  the episode was still good
@0909alz  what s your point  did i say that he s not gay  the game did not in any shape or form was trying to give a romance novel between bill and frank like the show did. it was meant to be a punchline at the end of a very aggressive level and as you said yourself to mess with joel
@joaofarinha551  i guess i misundertood your comment  i thought you were implying that bill being gay in the game was only a joke and not real.i agree with the rest obviously  the game didn t make a romance novel out of it and was more realistic.i disagree with it just being a punchline though  that scene was meant to show joel and ellie getting closer to a father-daughter relationship and they simply dropped that info in there so you could connect the dots about bill and frank. she wasn t making fun of bill.the game handled it really well imo.
@0909alz  that s fine by me as well. the only thing i do not agree with is people insinuating the episode was amazing and it gave backstory to these 2 characters when in fact the story was not like that at all and the game was not trying to give us a romance backstory
@rdtx2049  sure.  why flesh out side characters for an interesting story with growth and emotional investment  when they could just do some generic action for yet another car battery.  you should get a studio writing job.
@thedarkemissary  they could have not had them look for a battery in the beginning   kept that for when encountering bill  instead of switching it  them it wouldn t have been  for another car battery he wasn t that fleshed out in the episode that s easily thrown out  since there was no interaction with him
what is the problem
and he was played by jennifer lawrence.
@fejkpirat5118  beat me to it lmao
i agree like a good example is extraorndinay it started off with the girl trying to get with dudes and i felt very turned off by that but then once they actually stopped focusing on the romance part of her life and had fun with the premise i loved it and yes somehow i was on board with her getting with jizzlord and infact i think the made a good call in making the sister lesbian because otherwise idk i feel like they might have had to how i can i put this but talk about an uncomfortable issue with the sister dating a dude. heck i loved the scene with the other sister i think where was dating the dead french king or something. like you can have fun with intimate romance scenes but please make it be part of the story and actually do something with it.
yeah  i have skipped them or just stop watching the show. i have not watched all of game of thrones or house of the dragon. the explicit scenes put me off.
the show was rated for mature audiences if you can t handle that then you shouldn t be watching media made for mature audiences
@emmanuelguerrero8886  exactly
nothing  progressive  about that. more like regressive.
@crimzonnova5368  its progress towards ideological tyranny.
@auto1nfanticid3  understandable way of putting it.
@crimzonnova5368  the correct word is  oppressive . in an instance where someone otherwise wouldn t have watched something had they known what was in it  then are  tricked  into watching it anyway  is there really any difference from just outright  forcing  them to watch the lines are getting to be so blurred with the false advertising  and misinformation campaigns  can it really be classified as  optional  anymore
@buckrodgers1162  unfortunately no by the looks of it. might as well binge-watch the old stuff. get enough inspiration and make our own new stuff that doesn t follow the left s way. otherwise just don t watch media at all.
@crimzonnova5368  yeah  that s why kinda i stick to watching movies from about the 1940 s to the late 1990 s. anything past that time  is getting into iffy territory  where some are good  but most are just bad. and as for t.v. shows... well  there s only one or 2 that are still playing as re-runs that i still watch  but nothing new do i ever watch  or even think of watching.
i get its probably only being done because of company profit agendas.but if this was a straight couple if joel and tess were made to be a proper couple and had an entire episode about their relationship would half or even most of you be complaining as you do its hard sometimes to take melonie or her audiences takes reasonably when its not unlikely people just throw up their hands because of lgbt relationships shown in games and shows but if it was a random new straight couple or couple that didn t really exist but was also implied how many wouldn t care its just weird because people here are always like  i don t mind gay characters or gay couples but you don t want to see them interact at all or initmately and putting aside this being forced into a source material that lacked it part 2 and the dlc had ellie and her relationships shown and so many people even people here complain of that as well.
@buckrodgers1162  imagine if a gay person said they didn t like watching straight couples be intimate on tv.i just don t see where the line really is with you guys lol.
@chandllerburse737  imagine if someone period  doesn t really matter who they are  what they are  or what groups they are in  says thay they don t want to see any intimacy in the shows movies they choose to watch.i don t want to see any of that  because all it does is remind me of the fact that i will be alone all my existence. it depresses me to no end. tricking people into watching something  no matter what it is  is wrong. end o  story.
@buckrodgers1162  wow i just think i made you have a therapeutic break through dude lol.am i also alone lonely and a virgin.but i don t care if creators want to put intimacy in their creations its their creation their characters i know sometimes they make bad choices but simply arguing  i don t like any intimacy in the things i watch  is odd some games and movies want to explore that and its fine.the second game explored ellies relationship with dina and it wasn t as wrong for it as people continue to claim it was i feel it was portrayed not much different than a straight couple and hell it wasn t even a huge focus.i get they changed stuff here that sucks but thats really where the problem lies not intimacy in general or gay intimacy.
@buckrodgers1162  they didn t trick you to anything.you choose to watch it and you probably saw melonies other video you probably hate woke stuff you probably were concerned.also by your life and logic you literally couldn t watch back to the future blind without being  tricked  into seeing marty kiss his girlfriend and well weirdly enough his mom lol.
@chandllerburse737  kissing is one thing.  intimacy  is an entirely different thing. kissing has be done in movies  as long as movies have existed. the fornication however  has been kept in an entirely different set of movies  up until more recently. and no  i don t like a certain part of  the terminator 1984    as well as some other 70 s - late 90 s movies either  for that same reason. just because you kids are out in the open with it  don t mean i  or others in a like-minded state  have to accept  or even like it. let alone be forced to watch it.
@buckrodgers1162  kissing is intimacy too arguably
@buckrodgers1162  just because you dont like it doesn t make it wrong or bad to exist in media.its also how couples work i dont always like or get why especially gamers defend every sex scene in existence people who hate woke stuff whine about the lack of sex mini games in gow i mean they were funny i guess but it makes zero sense for kratos to still be that way in 2018.and besides theres a massive lack of women in norse lands in that world anyways.but theres nothing bad about it being in a creation if creators seek to have it especially to present the relationship of a couple.your critique is simply just a biased opinion not a valid critique i feel
@chandllerburse737  your argument is invalid in this situation. the director bragged about tricking people into watching it. do what you want in your bedroom but don t call me names because i don t want to participate. at the end of the day sexual experimentation is the opposite of being progressive. every society that has become comfortable has had kids who were selfish and determined to do what they want. sexual identity has led to the collapse of many an empire  if people want to leave like they are part of 3000 year old society then more power to them. you do you  but year this... we aren t amused or entertained.
@jim.simpson  well then the director is stupid but the fact you went on a rant about sexual experimentation kind of implies that i wasnt far off with the asking of where the line is.also opposite of progression is regression meaning we go backwards towards traditional things like sex norms like only straight people should exist and be allowed to do anything dude so thats incorrect as hell.and yeah yeah yeah the oversaid crap all you peopl here always say  society is collapsing because gays and lesbians and trans i don t support maps i think incest is wrong but why draw the line before same sex consensual adults as harsh as its done also romans were more christianized by the time their empire fell anyways.they were probably more pagan and hyper sexual before then in fact they caused a natural contraceptive to go extinct and the roman empire is often the biggest example you guys use yet everytime i look into it. its more of a bigger complex debate than you guys make it to be as far i can see.considering some even argue christianity caused some of the collapse which maybe wasnt that bad of a thing some also argue i guess to the nomadic tribes which caused some of it as well.i don t care about hearing the same regurgitation each time anymore mate.
@jim.simpson  i never called you names and i ain t gay myself lol
@jim.simpson  independence is such a horrible thing i know right wanting to be an individual who is accepted for who they are and what they enjoy what do you people want with these arguments  you always say  i am not this  but these arguments make that hard to see.i get it selfishness is bad but people jhave always been selfish in many ways and its even odder when you guys hate socialism and communism because its evil but capitalism encourages more of the  individual for themselves  ideal and i get you don t like capitalism either but you prefer it and hate anyone who protests against it in favor of something else.also its odd to argue that being gay and accepting gay people is making society more selfish.
@chandllerburse737  it was not my intention to insulate you called anyone a name. i was speaking to the large conversation when people do speak out about what they don t like.
@jim.simpson  well every convo on these videos is nothing but misunderstandings and heated arguments when someone disagrees anyways.same for any other political based channel
@jim.simpson  i usually mean melonies audience and some form of conservatives not conservatives in general of course since i basically come from a conservative family myself i guess.you don t have to watch but thats a opinion on watching sex on tv not a valid critique of a show i feel.
@greenfroggood2392  i just dont think i am superior to others and should dictate their sexuality.humans seem destined to be doomed anyways
like the abundance of straight relationships portrait in media.
@floki-d.  i mean thats what i mean
@chandllerburse737  i wasn t talking to you
@floki-d.  you didn t have to be in order for me to have replied to you lol
@chandllerburse737  you answered as if i did
@floki-d.  who cares
@chandllerburse737  it was just confusing
@floki-d.  nice one. slam straight relationships to prove your point. classic. let s end all relationships  that ll show em.
@floki-d.  ok
@jim.simpson  nice satire there. would be a shame if it sounded as ridiculous as your first  nonironic  comment
@jim.simpson  i mean he wasn t slamming straight relationship. straight couples have been in tv movies games  everything since there inceptions. so someone saying  there s nothing but straight couples in media  isn t an attack cause it s literally  the truth
@ozymandias2540  i understand  but but it sets a precedence for any type of relationship.
@jim.simpson  what exactly is this  precedence  that it set that could be a negative  cause as far as i see  they re just two human beings falling in love in a way you or i would
@jim.simpson  didn t you already admit you dislike seeing any relationship be intimate at all you re kind of already there
@ozymandias2540  i don t know what this comment section is.i get not liking the change to the story and the director is dumb for saying they wanted to trick people but people here comment as if its bad at all to see gay couples be intimate on tv when we ve seen straight couples do this same shit for decades.reminds me of an argument with a girl who wouldn t give a better explanation for why it was wrong for two women to kiss in buzz lightyear movie and called it  sexual  when it was just kissing and kids movies for years have had kissing and romance between straight couples.batman the animated series had fucking straight people kissing.who cares this much
@chandllerburse737
for grown men to complain is the biggest insecurity. allowing yourself as  straight  men to let this consume you is weird. secure men don t even take the time to talk about a gay couple. such a weird flex.
@rmag2416  ok
the only time i didn t mind was outlander.
just do it like soaps do. show some kissing and then fade to black. it doesn t need to be pornographic.
@ghostofasiren  who s soaps
@halfort57  soap operas
@halfort57  sorry. i just meant soap operas.
i used to like nick offerman because of his portrayal of ron swanson but this is the complete opposite. gross
way to ruin a fan favorite character. he was gay in the first game sure  but he was also still a badass. they made his character all about his sexuality now. no personality at all.
@themightycrixus1131  i don t know about him. in terms of acting he was good though  but whatever was in the show wasn t bill we see in the game.
@shaikanwolf8  the game devs really nailed how to make a character gay and keep the thing in limit. you see  people like bill in the game despite of his sexuality. but the bill in the show only gets hate from the fans. the problem isn t the homosexuality here  but the way film industry portrays that in the production. anyhow many people wanted to see bill s story  but obviously is turns out to be a bummer.
i fast forwarded through 40 minutes of the episode. it was hard to watch.
@rachell8661  but they got your view.and that is the whole problem.
@rdtx2049  its the virtue signaling and subversion that is the issue
it was really weird. at no point did i feel the  romance . it just felt seedy and awkward. it felt like a story about a vulnerable man being groomed.
@unofficialname  all the while grooming the audience
the show is a bait and switch.
good thing you guys can stop watching it now before you see any lesbian action.
@rmag2416  might as well as that will suck given how they would fuck that up
bait and switch. i m surprised they waited until episode 3 to prove me right
@dermagnus8482  i don t know about rachel i  but there s a ton of ways to watch and still not give them a view view time.
@themightycrixus1131  okay so he s an actor he is doing his job he is playing a person that isn t himself if he can do swanson then a gay guy thats just him being an actor dude who cares if he did this he s just an actor working.
sums up the sony audience in generalthey bought the exact same last of us game 3 times in a row knowing fully well its a cash grab
@broghad8241  lol spot on
sheeps will keep being sheeps. they will always enter the slaughterhouse.
it s trendy to be a degenerate these days.
i played about twenty minutes  half hour of the first game  it bored the mortal shit out of me and i never went back. nice to know i wasn t missing anything.
@themightyfiction8792  the last of us is one of the most overhyped game series to ever exist. and this is coming from someone who owns a playstation. and the fact that idiots bought that first game 5 times over is just sad. especially when the remake for the ps5 was created to get back some of the goodwill  and money especially  that they lost on the second game
@madmoneyman5000  finally  someone said it. there are way better stories than tlou.
@nanayahashira  yup. like ghost of tsushima
@animegamergeek1427  no it wasn t. however  the trash of us 2 was pure bullshit. especially the ending
@madmoneyman5000  to some it was   to others it wasn t
i mean they made it clear it wasn t going to be exactly like the game so it s not really tricky. just homophobia
@ozymandias2540   nothing to do with homophobia. stop with that bs
@chariesobee7705  thank you. and based on how mad you re getting  you ve done nothing but prove my point about how garbage and overhyped this game series truly is
@madmoneyman5000  i m don t see you respecting anybody s opinion either so it makes to of us.
@chariesobee7705  and what is it i m not understanding
well. not everyone is gonna be negative at everything.
@silashurd3597  never said  everything
i liked the show until this episode.
wokifying your show is a cheap and easy way to get praise. and if that doesn t work on everyone  you get to pretend it s just because they re hateful.
@silashurd3597  why should everyone think like the mob
@user-ld2vu2qi8p  i dunno.
@silashurd3597  the mob being the best tv episode ever  brigade.
i thought about the game. it was mediocre at best but people have jizzed their pants over it.
i watch ronnie on his channel  make a path presents . he does really good analyses on the show. he was so bored and it didn t do anything to progress the storyline.
@disillusionedplayer  dont be ashamed to say your not ok with teh gay.
@dark5cythe545  based
there s a few people speaking out.
@palladiamorsdeus  same  if anything tlou ruined gaming with it s  cinematic  bs.  i wish it was never made.
because synthetic man is melonie s secret persona kept alive with help of deepfake technology and voice modulators.
@vyacheslav794  it all makes sense now...
@dark5cythe545  being against teh gay ain t much but it s honest work.
cuz it is a masterpiece to some
synthetic man literally just hates everything  it gets annoying at times.
@shadowman4454  everything needs to stop sucking though
@shadowman4454  he made several positive videos on games  you would know if you actually watched any of his videos.
@mrscruffles801  i m subscribed to him  i watch his vids. but hating on everything  with few exceptions  isn t helping and just makes you come across as a whiner  which is annoying.
@shadowman4454  don t care  i m entertained by it
this whole show is a bait and switch. and if you think it s bad now  wait until season two where they push the abby agenda like they did in the second game
@madmoneyman5000  oh i know  my dad called it as well that they were going to  bait and switch  and he s never even played the game. only knows as much as i told him about it.but i m not even going to watch it anymore after this episode. since i know their true direction with this series now. good thing they outed themselves out very early in.
@madmoneyman5000  its not like that was unexpected people
neil druckman ruined this entire series  people think he s the director of the first game and he wasn t. he butchered the second game and is letting the show get butchered while pretending to be all-knowing about the first game. the guy s a tool.
lou2 was trash  most players agree. look at the subreddit lol.
i remember tlou2 was being left on the shelves in stores on release due to lack of interest  even being discounted early   yet we re being told it was a resounding success. i expected the series to head in that same trajectory
false advertising its called not spoiling the game when people were already asking if joel dies lol.games have altered trailers before i get that joels death made people mad but good lord none of you would ever say this shit about any other game that have done the same.people even suggested suing them  yeah like they would win against nd s lawyers it just doesn t make sense to me anymore to claim this.
@paul_landero8166  he was the director though  at least one
@paul_landero8166  neil made joel and ellie even bruce staley said this what the crap are you claiming dude i ve seen the stupid making of documentary he had a part in making the game he also worked on uncharted with amy whatever her name is.i know you hate him but don t lie about his involvement in these games.
@mig1017  i ve never seen it on shelves people say it did well and it supposedly did if it didn t do at least enough that sony was happy then neil wouldn t have been promoted and sony wouldn t have been pleased.and people say one thing others say another and don t even try to claim minority has a loud voice you guys are also called the minority by fans who like the game.i honestly am neutral about both games to an extent they are fun and replayable the second s story is well whatever and the first story is decent even good i guess but i will never get calling either a masterpiece anyways.
i think the same guy is involved too as an executive producer
i think intimacy should be just that  intimate. between two people. it s the same reason i get skeeved out watching anybody make out in my day to day  because it s not my business  it s theirs.
you re definitely entitled to your feelings and outlook. i personally loved the episode  it was done in a way that made me feel something which many shows have failed to do in recent times  blood origin  which really has made tv so hard to enjoy lately. nick offerman really played the character perfectly. so like yeah i get certain people being uncomfortable  but i found it beautiful  so to each their own with this particular episode.
imagine thinking this show would do anything else
11 30 i ll catch you next time  and in the meantime i won t obey! had me rolling.
as a standalone episode  i wouldn t have watched it had i known what it was about  however to the director s credit he does it in a  mostly  classy way and told a story of a couple living and dying together.like you  i don t want to see sexually intimate scenes at all in films  let alone two men  and frankly i m glad this was the one episode i didn t sit down with my family to watch. nothing is worse than a sex scene when your parents are sat there.  note  there wasn t actually a sex scene in this episode the episode is obviously structured so it is removable in less  liberal  countries.
i m glad i m not the only one who thinks sex scenes in film or television are uncomfortable to watch
here to remind everyone that melonie s laughter from friday night tights is both adorable and infectious.
they forgot to add  the first bro on bro romance ever
the only shocking thing is that people are shocked.
sigh. not surprised they would do something like that at all. hope you re having a wonderful saturday  melonie. you look cute today and your videos always make my day
i have no plans on watching the last of us. pretty much for all the reasons you mentioned. so i agree with you. that s funny  no go boom at the end of the video. oh well. you made a lot of good points melonie  3  3  3
it worked out though... he tricked me too. liked the first 2 episodes alot. i am done with the show now though. good work guys!
the post-mortem sentiment expressed in this episode via bill to joel was emblematic of the series as a whole  and will be paid off in the finale  setting up the events for part 2.
once i knew hbo max was in charge of the last of us i knew this would happen
absolutely respect the time and dedication you put into your videos melonie. and your consistent releases
i was very surprised by it to be sure  when i heard that this episode will be about bill i was expecting some sort of a retelling of those sections from the game where joel and ellie interact with bill and fight of infected and stuff but im now starting to be more and more convinced that they want to change a ton of scenes that were kind of important for character development in the game and are just not here in the show or are so radically changed that it just doesn t hit the same anymore. but i guess what else can you expect from these production companies  they don t know what fans want  never have and never will  and this is especially true in gaming adaptations to screen. it just never works.
1 45 corn huh thought it was called something else.  good job staying family friendly melonie
agreed! i was waiting for the season to end before committing to watching this  but i m out i can live without it!
best parts of this episode was when ron swanson got butt naked and said let me taste dem frank and beans. and the other part where ron swanson gets shot and frank lays him on the table and says  don t worry billy boy i ll just suck that bullet out..... . truly stunning and brave writing. i also liked how both characters walked around with a slight  almost limp. kinda like they had a stick up their butts. phenomenal acting.
exactly i don t care who it is.
@xaforn  yet you don t complain when straight intimacy is portrait in media
okay but movies also have scenes in showers and toilets so should we also remove those do you people all here claim you never watched any movie with straight couples kissing even having sex or people showering and such good movies with these scenes and shows too have reasons for them disliking this for the change and pointlessness of it is valid i suppose but hating it for showing intimacy that so many pieces of media have done for years and even done well is odd
it is kinda sad  didn t play the game and heard that part 2 was highly controversial  but still had hopes
we all know druckmann fantasizes about this stuff. not surprised at this at all.
uncomfortable to watch when people dont know what ya watching. or if the sex scene last longer than a minute.  its just plot filler.  like a 4 minute sex scene is unnecessary unless.  it drives the plot  if they trying to portray the lust between two characters a minute scene wont drive that home.  which is consistent in romance stories.
exactly.  all the sex and full-frontal nudity and open homosexualtiy was the worst parts of game of thrones as well.  that s why people stopped watching that show too.  hbo never learns. sarcasm
@thedarkemissary  which ppl
just wait till the season with abby lol
aw thank you
@meloniemacgoboom  you re welcome. was only being honest.
true. i didn t realize she was that cool until then
thank u for the entertainment honestly
milk is good...but it can be butter!
definitely one of the more enjoyable fnts in a while. she stole the show.
i m a guy and was wishing mel or oden would speak more because the others had filthy mouths.
@ancestorempire  simp
@lividlibies  cry
@nightmarezero8465  beanie and blocking of the quartering sold separately.
contact me for your reward
i smelled the wokeness from the beginning and decided not to watch a single episode. imagine my shock lol
even though i feel like it s a little twisted to be awkward around sexuality while being okay with the gory stuff and all  i 100  respect your resilience to not watch game of thrones and house of the dragon. cause i know how it is to not have watched it while people around you try to push you.
the intimate stuff was something i definitely could have gone without seeing  but overall i think it was a good episode.
i agree that nudity and excessive violence and language is a turn off for me in media it s all filler
palm slap to forehead. the last of us. this show. my goodness. hey melonie. cool hoodie. you looks amazing. hope you re having fun today.  3
i m glad i never watched it and now i m not going to watch it. thanks for letting us know. also  i love your shirt! you look great today!  3
i think you dodged a bullet there by putting it down at the first episode. they ll take any and every opportunity to push the agenda  even where it isn t needed
i think fans would of appreciated a back story episode of tess and joels complicated relationship opposed to this.
i 100  agree with you. i was waiting for reviews and for the full season to come out as i played the 1st game but as soon as i heard about the 3rd episode i decided to skip the entire series. i wish smexual perversion would stop being pushed in every form of entertainment.
they definitely pushed it very hard and that s when it once again feels forced. like they are inherently trying to score some brownie points politically and with the alphabet mafia. personally i ain t the biggest fan of when movies or shows go super into it with straight sex  . it s always better done when it s insinuated that is whats about to happen but cuts to the next scene as it starts. when shows or movies feel the need to show in depth 5 minute long sex scenes it honestly is uneeded and kinda awkward . but there s also ways to do these scenes without it feeling 100  forced. the game originally handled it extremely well with subtly hinting at how he was his  partner  but said in a way where you knew what he implied. the fact is they completely changed this part of the game just to push this scene and it s so obvious  . the fact bill and frank are both shown. the fact they die together instead of bill being alive and meeting ellie and helping them. the only reason they did that was to force this into the show which damaged it a bit for me. hopefully that s out of the way and we can get back to the joel and ellie surviving in the apocalypse
l   hey light  are you gay  light   no. l   so youre straight. light   yes. l   are you sure youre straight  light   yes. l   so youre straight. light   yes. l   so youre kira. light   yes... ... ... wait.
hey  remember when from the beginning you warned about this show and had reservations about it  and a bunch of people got mad at you turns out you called it  melonie. you knew all along not to get on board with it.
i enjoyed watching you hang out with the boys on friday night tights.i didn t know you had a cool laugh.editif chrissie quits fnt  she s not been there for 2 weeks you would be an excellent replacement. just something to think about...
in the game  bill assumed frank left him one day when frank and some items were gone. when leaving the town with joel and ellie is when he discovers frank s body and a last intimate farewell to bill before taking his own life before the bite he took killed him. this was when we the player learned of their relationship was more then platonic. the show really ruined that perfect moment of character development.show  don t tell.
they tricked me into having hope again.
the episode was amazing.
last of us 1x3 was an extremely good episode with amazing acting  but imo they could have cut out 20 minutes from certain scenes and it would have had the same impact.
if they were a straight couple i swear on my life it wouldn t be as hailed as it is
second episode is a gem
i predicted this kind of thing. they re pretty much trying to adapt a story from two games so of course they re gonna stretch it out as they can  even to the point where they need to hammer it in your skull that that guy that you interact with for 30 minutes in the game  is gay. my guess is that they will stretch the first game out for 2 seasons before we end up rage quitting when abby s pga tournament begins  and maybe then it will be stretched so long that they ll might catch up with the 3rd game. or they won t and just fully wing it like what happened with got.
it s not that twisted in this shows context it was advertised as a horror  zombie  show and this third episode gives so much whiplash. i mean the first two episodes we were following joel and ellie through places that had infected and of course joel killing said infected to survive. people playing the game expected this as well. then this third episode comes in  erases some of the most exiting parts of the game which most definitely could have been done in the show as well  instead it takes a character we know in the game as a badass who happens to be gay  and makes an episode that is so far from the tone of the series so far and also is so far from the character we know.
dude  not everything has to be pg-13. some of the best movies and shows have nudity  have sexuality  and violence. is it overdone sometimes  yes. this episode was an example of that. but to say it s all filler is ludicrous. breaking bad  the sopranos  game of thrones to name a few.
these comments sound like a bot lol
thank you so much andrew  i appreciate you
@meloniemacgoboom  you re most welcome! keep on inspiring people!
right ! hate to say i told ya so to these peeps  but i told them so! lol! but noooo   you re just grifting  this show isn t woke!  baaaah!
@meloniemacgoboom  i read some of the negative comments and i thought   y know... i have the feeling some of these comments are gonna age poorly and melonie s gonna be proven right in the end. like i said  you called it. you knew what you were talking about
@meloniemacgoboom  just for one episode doesn t mean the entire show is woke. plus in the game they re both are ghay and were a couple anyways. you dissappeared in the second episode that was quite good. you only appear to criticise negatively everything you can  not to mention you re obsessed with the woke thing. and is telling you someone who is against the woke stuff.
@user-oy8lr2of4c  pretty sure the main criticism was the statement of  tricking everyone into watching it . woke show or not  that s pretty low. producers lately keep thinking they pull a fast one on everyone and it s pretty pathetic to say the least.
@bolg892  you seem so bitter  touch grass. lmao i said facts
@user-oy8lr2of4c  quite good. that s the best you could describe it as  not the best television episode in years  that had you in tears and was so important for representation blah blah blah like the shills are doing.
@meloniemacgoboom  having a story that features a gay couple and being woke are two different things. was moby dick woke  was six feet under woke  i m against woke stuff being crammed into media for woke sake just as much as the next person but you are clearly reaching here. you made up your mind about this show before even watching episode 1. it s obvious you re following a linear preset narrative to form an opinion. and yeah  not everything is for everybody  but this episode was presented earnestly and wasn t trying to force some woke agenda. we already knew bill was gay and they just explored that a little more closely. you are nitpicking.
@cuccamunga   we tricked you into watching a gay romance!  nah  not woke at all! right  little shill
haha can i get simp for 100  alec
@meloniemacgoboom  you talked about a gay couple on a show based on a game that has always been made by progressive people and bill was always gay anyways.i get its still changing the source but would you be saying this if bill was straight and they wasted an entire episode on him and a girlfriend instead it just begs the question sometimes i don t get why one group forces lgbt diversity agendas into things just for profit and making them token gays but the other sometimes says  i dont mind gay couples or people but i do not like seeing them intimate like a straight couple on tv or in media even if its new media not changing old it seems to happen.companies need to stop treating gay couples as just a way to gain extra audience money and some people need to stop treating every single gay person or couple on tv or games nowadays as immediately awful and woke even when they don t even try to force it sometimes.i just don t get where the line is anymore
@palladiamorsdeus  i was tricked into playing a game that is called a masterpiece by too many people but is actually just a good story and the gameplay is average and the sequel shows the story being bad would ve made everyone hate it anyways.how about that  lola bit harsh on the game but its sort of how i feel loland of course i wasn t tricked i didn t even bother with the game.but when you came into this show especially with melonies critiques before you kind of had to expect some changes some caution.its not great and it probably is because sony and hbo execs see gay people as dollar signs but is it really that awful to see gay couples be intimate like straight couples are shown all the time at least bill was gay in the game and they didn t just force it.the title of the vid implies to me at first they somehow had joel do incest and that was much more disturbing to consider lol.
@cuccamunga  honestly  the mischaracterization of what the writer said is so frustrating.  sometimes you have to sort of trick the rest of the world into watching these things before they re like   oh  my god  it was two guys. i just realized   hoar said in an interview with inverse.  i think then they might understand that it s all real. it s just the same love.  they re all running with the narrative that the writer  tricked people  when that is very different from the actual sentiment of the statement which was to illustrate the process of presenting a digestible gay dynamic that most people wouldn t be able to distinguish the difference between a gay couple or a straight couple.
@user-oy8lr2of4c  it s telling of a director when they have to trick people into watching a gay romance
@user-oy8lr2of4c  lol  did i say the show wasn t successful  i liked the show   episode 3 was ok. so  who s mad  seems u are  304  stay mad 304  since u wanna start pathetic insults for no reason.all i said is what the director actually admitted to doing
@animegamergeek1427  what a snow-flake lmao keep sper -ging though i love it.
@user-oy8lr2of4c  lol  i have no clue what u are talking about   but hey  whatever floats ur boat
@animegamergeek1427  i agree with the female lead thing. people always say that as a defense whenever it s poorly and actually forced. but this wasn t. this was actually well done and beautifully told and all i can see are people calling it all this stupid shit like  woke  and  progressivism  without giving any legitimate criticism. and also whenever it is about gay people  people always complains! way more than when it s a movie show with a female lead. so yeah i kinda just assume it s homophobia at this point.
@ozymandias2540  yeah  some call it woke   stuff. some are from homophobia  but there are a lot that genuinely just didn t like this deviation from the game  which made them dislike it.the director knew it  so he had to be deceptive
@animegamergeek1427  i don t mind it deviating from the game  cause i think bills story  retrospectively  wasn t very deep in the game and i don t find it deceptive personally  i also don t watching marketing and interviews for stuff like this cause those are always full of shit   but i d rather hear that real criticism  you have than these people just saying the same crap i ve been hearing and seeing
@ozymandias2540  i m just going by what the director has admitted  that he wanted to trick the audience into watching a gay romance. i d consider that deceptive  the episode was ok  but i still preferred the game s event with the interaction with ellie   bill.even combined them. give a more detailed backstory with bill   frank  frank dies   when we meet up with bill  we have a better understanding of why bill is the way he is
@animegamergeek1427  what a ner-dy preferring a game where the interactions a dry and robot mode lmao its not even funny. i prefer watching actually real people.
@user-oy8lr2of4c  what s  ner-dy   do u mean  nerdy    anyway  the game s voiced by real people  so what are u talking about
@animegamergeek1427  i write that way because yt is lately eliminating some of my comments but whatever.
@animegamergeek1427  yeah acted by real ppl in general  where you can see body language  feel emotions  and connect more with characters   also this actually feels like a real pandemic unlike the game   instead of a dry and robots interactions. for example i haven t played the game but i saw the part where ellie makes the pun jokes to joel  in the game  and it s quite a-wful just cringe.
@user-oy8lr2of4c  that s u. of course u feel this way  cuz u haven t played the game  watching a game   playing a game is different. i liked both the game   the show.the jokes came out better in the game to me. wasn t bad in the show  but i liked in-game better.some of the dialogue in the game sounded way better in the game. don t always have to see a person to appreciate them
@animegamergeek1427  let s agree to disagree then. in my view this is way better acted than the game. not even close.
@ozymandias2540  i feel there was no actual need for a whole episode dedicated to this but maybe they are running out of ideas to stretch for entire episodes but its still clearly probably here because showing off bill s sexuality is more of a dollar sign to them than an actual need probably maybe it was done well but i haven t watched this show and probably never will.besides apparently netflix is making god of war and twisted metal and i rather see those potential disasters lol.
@user-oy8lr2of4c  there is nothing really roboty about joel and ellies interactions most games in my opinion have better characters than most movies or shows ever had.for one horror games don t suffer as much from dumb cliche characters i feel lol.
@user-oy8lr2of4c  you should play rdr2 then the emotions are very good and visible.also games didn t need to have good graphics to show emotions to be emotional anyways even older graphics did it well sometimes like with dead rising and resident evil games.
last intimate farewell he literally wrote a note that said he hates being alone with bill now and he insulted him and thats why he wanted to leave lol
if frank was straight they would be focusing on the don t tread on me flag  his anti government views  his love for guns and his conservative learnings.
there wouldn t have been a whole episode dedicated to romanticize a normal relationship.
i am 99  sure melonie wouldn t be talking about it as much or labeling it as she seems on the thumbnail in a likewise way. or even at all.of course she clearly wanted to say crap about this show from the beginning since she immediately made a video about how everyone is loving it but her.then again i sometimes do the same with the game since i think its good but not a damn masterpiece so i get it.
@user-ld2vu2qi8p  anti government views 20 years into the future when the government doesn t exist anymore seems pointless
@bambix1982  if it was no one would say the same stuff as they are here though i d bet too thats his point still.
while i thought it was nice to see bill and frank story  they didn t need a whole damn episode! they could have cut most of it and had bill alive and a bit messed up cause frank left him like in the game. we were excited for some joel  ellie and bill banter and action  not in bed action with bill being a lost puppy! and i m saying this as someone who loves romantic stuff and doesn t care about the pairings as long as it s good storytelling.
all i ve ever wanted is joal and his brother be antiheros  ambushing and getting ambushed
if this was their main motivation for making the show then i guess it s all down hill from here because the motivation to create something to keep an audience is gone now. it s over they got what they wanted so i don t expect them to try and make something worth watching after this.
they didn t trick me. i knew they wouldn t respect the source material so i didn t watch it.
i don t know a single straight man  including myself  who wants to willingly watch these types of romances. there s a reason why that bros gay romance film failed. i won t lie there were some emotional scenes and some nice scenes involving the two men but by the end it was completely pointless as they both die. the game is ten times better story wise than the show and it isn t even close. appreciate your honesty melonie
100  agree melanie !!! if i wanted  tricks    i d watch david copperfield or eat the cereal   with an  x  . why do these morons not get that if you are not interested in the material presented   that ultimately we will stop watching.  if they turned into an hour of bill dance fishing how to videos i d still turn it off cuz i m not interested in fishing. does that make me anti-fish   reminds me of the old folgers commercials . . .  we secretly replaced this person s coffee with this brand . let see what happens . . .   except at least it was still coffee . if i replaced these same woke jerks starbucks coffee with beet juice   i m thinking they might be upset. i wish we could somehow rig up something to change their tv channels to   hallmark or cspan and send our regards each time the channel changes. at what point did personal opinion and choice die       was gonna make a  right to choose  comment but decided otherwise  anyway   love    your ability to logically and rationally cut to the truth of the matter !!!
keep up the good work
i love these videos because she s the queen of  i m not watching this but here s my opinion. then here comes  i don t have to watch something to give an opinion tho.
the director never tricked me because i fast-forwarded ahead lol
i hate watching scenes like that. i feel so gross watching it. i m not much of a christian  i do believe and god and all that but i don t go to church or anything most christians do  and i m not against gay people but i hate watching people be intimate  especially when it comes without warning .it s disgusting and needs to stop.
how i sleep never having watched an episode.
i think this how the show will be 80  if the episodes will be great sprinkled within a couple of  odd  choices
it s not the gay part that pisses me off. it s the trick part.
one of the things this episode promotes is something i ve become sick and tired of  and that is the idea that two men can t be close to  or care about one another  without sexual attraction. watch movies like   secondhand lions  or   let s get harry   or  bat 21   or heck... star trek tos and star trek ii  iii  and iv. at various points  they all offer their futures for the sake of their fellows  without any of them wanting to hump any of the others  not even sulu  george tekai himself asserted that sulu was straight . you came back for me... why did you do that   because the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many ... notice how near that scene of star trek iii  kirk doesn t stick his tongue down spock s throat. we re supposed to accept that men and women can have platonic relationships  while at the same time we re supposed to think that men and men can t.
makes me uncomfortable too. shame because the last two episodes were great
the first two episodes were  the last of us got race swapped  and you are crazy if you thought they d stop there with their  diversity and inclusion  checklist. so  now we ve had  the last of us are old homosexuals  and no doubt  the last of us are men who have periods  is coming soon.
when i was playing cyberpunk 2077  i ended up in an uncomfortable position in the tank after trying to knock back panams advances. i didnt expect that doing the missions alone would trigger the romance  i felt tricked and i was just like okay this is happening... i felt very similarly about this episode! i agree with you that the game is better and this series is boring  i wanted to see the bloater fight and i am actually enjoying the fact the series can explore more not linked to joel and ellie directly. its this whole subversion of expectations thing that rian johnson likes to do but at the end of the day i was so bored by this slow side story i ended up fast forwarding  ahs nyc which is a whole season filled with gay men... i actually watched the entire thing but aye i guess its not hip to talk about that show.  progressive agnostic btw
i knew going into it that bill was gay cuz i played the game. then admitting to tricking people into watching it is a little sus tho
well i sure hope someone picks up that phone...cause i freaking called it!  - melonie mac
recent example of a perfect intimacy scene  top gun maverick. they almost started the nasty  and then boom next scene.
@andresa.ruizv.7413  the games still exist and we can go back and play them at any time. the show isn t gonna change the game s story.
@theweitna  yes  you are right  with more the reason why we should appreciate the og source in cases like this and defend it when any misjudge comes to the game when the serie s lies starts after claiming it is  based on the most important game of ps3 4 . if you feel like defending the game after a follower of the serie but it ignorant of the game misjudges the og source of the serie  then you may have the right.
there will be nothing more important in the post-apocalyptic world than diversity  equity  and inclusion.  p
bill was always a homosexual and so was ellie anyways.
showed up for the beauty  stayed for the content
so this is brokeback mountain with zombies
fun fact esther is a woman joel dated in the years between the two games. she was actually supposed to be mentioned in a cut epilogue to the first game  but that scene was cut. in the last of us part 2  naughty dog decided to try and bring her into the story again with the flashback scene where tommy teaches ellie long-range shooting with a sniper rifle. esther is said to have lived two hours away from jackson  so the plan was for joel and ellie to check up on her in that part of the game.ultimately  however  naughty dog realised that there won t be any time to establish esther s character before she s killed off.  even up until toward the end of the game  we netlike a love letter from esther in his house   gross added.
i hope your having an amazing day and keep up this great content! i don t get why people hate common sense or religion! and this is coming from a person who isn t religious but i ll be darned if i don t think it has good effects especially on peoples morals
if they are willing to trick people into watching a television episode then they re willing to lie about all sorts of d vious shenanigans.
ironic that they did this and having ellie deny her girl crush and mall adventure in the last of us one dlc earlier on.she said she was bitten there but she was alone.of course we already knew from that ellie herself was gay.so there was enough  representation   to begin with! all the wise cracking between ellie and bill lost too.and the tense action scenes.if they had kept that in  ellie  would of had something in common with joel as both their girlfreinds died from being attacked and infected by clickers.something they could of bonded over. instead we got a intro of ellie acting pissed that joel won t talk to her and saying it was his choice taking the mission and not her fault no empathy here. a lost opportunity.
and i tricked him by not watching it.
thought it was a beautiful episode  well directed and handled. truly inspiring and important.
i seen people deflecting pointlessness of the romance  frank guy was pretty cool character and handled quite decently  it s just it was very california style shoe horned in  glad that naughty dog people at least can write things well enough.
it s also filler  fan fiction by the director himself. so  people can be mad at being tricked into watching a bromance that didn t add anything to its storyline. the game s bill and frank were wholly different in terms of their character and relationship.
i was planning to watch this show  but not anymore. i should have known better though.
i agree in that i do not enjoy sex scenes. feels like it takes away from the story and something that alludes to it briefly goes better. guess im a prude also lol
i legit do not remember such a scene in the game.how high am i rn
i didn t feel tricked about anything and thought it was a very well written story with a sad ending
i m a gay man  and still prefer the part about bill in the actual game. it was such a missed opportunity because bill s character is pretty cool with his traps. i couldn t sit though the episode at all  i just cringed.
man  i was gonna watch this series  after playing tlou game. i thought they were following the game pretty well. but now  goddammit  not that i m surprised.
if you look at steve cortez in mass effect 3  if you take one word from one line of dialogue and change  husband  to  wife  you would never know he was gay and his character and personality would not change one bit. that s how you write good characters. you make them characters. not megaphones to spread your ideology.
i think they should have stuck to the story line in the game which was far better. i played the game with my daughter and have been watching the show with her  but we skipped past this part because it was not very interesting or well written. they killed bill off for no reason and lost the opportunity to have the interactiion with him and ellie.
i ve been getting so much grief for having an issue with this episode and it s such bullshit that the director felt he had to swindle lie to us to make us watch what he thought we needed to see.
the real mistery to me is why ya ll are still watching all these woke productions with so many alternatives.
not as fun as the fact that the original concept for abby was for her to he an older woman and date joel before she killed him.
@chandllerburse737  proof
@drakenpage6776  i think neil confirmed this  and concept art in game shows an older looking abby and some concepts of a different death scene from that version.neil also i believed confirmed jackson chapter was meant to be 6 hours long at one point.
this!
it s not in the game  it s just implied that bill is gay but he doesn t have a romance in it
when i read   that the tv series will be strongly influenced by the last of us 2 representation ... this told me volumes  about how it will be ...
the episode devoted more time to bill   frank s relationship that the first two episodes did with the main characters of joel and ellie.
i never even finished the first episode of house of the dragon i liked game of thrones because i am a bookworm who has read many plots involving pre-industrial revolution societies with magic
i felt a little uncomfortable during that one scene  everything else was perfect. this episode was the best so far  broke my heart
bahaha. the l hoodie and the deathnote in the thumbnail. didn t notice at first. love it  melonie. hope to see more fire emblem today.
i hate how i was am outlayer how i criticized the change to bill and frank  in the game frank died getting infected hating bill  and how even if it was a straight relationship it was kind of creepy the hbo version was.
miss the days when pornography was a taboo thing
people can skip 40 minutes of the episode and will have missed nothing so yea he got everyone to watch a boring gay romance story. for the record  it isnt homophobic to be uncomfortable seein two dudes kiss. tired of twitter demanding everyone praise peoples sexuality
while i wasn t watching lou for a romance story  i can t help but notice it was actually better than most hallmark movies. on another topic  assisted suicide while it hasn t been a hot topic in a while. how hilarious would it have been if they got backlash from trying do downplay assisted suicide with queer baiting. seemed out of character for bill not fighting him.
i thought the episode was pretty good. whenever i noticed that they were starting to get a little hot and heavy  that s when i used the old fast-forward button
this is why i only watch anime.
honestly for a lot of people this will be something to turn them away. while not being directly against gay things doesn t mean you want to indulge in them either and for people like myself that s an immediate turn off from the media. how do they say it   it wasn t made for me.  so i shut off and put something on that feels like it s for me
i hope no other episodes should be skipped
oh come on  what the f   . have a good weekend everyone
i knew the show was going to do this. during this episode i saw it coming several minutes before it happened. i don t care to watch it but it doesn t bother me so much. what was most annoying was they didn t keep at least one of them alive as i especially would ve liked to see a show with survivalist nick offerman on it.
so no one gonna talk how beautiful melonie look here
people don t like bamboozled  hoodwinked or lied to. that is exactly what they did they deceived their fans and audience. if episode 4 doesn t get enough views  i don t feel  bad for hbo.
to be fair  the last of us part 2 was based around ellie s sexuality  and the first time you meet abby  all you learn about her is that she has relationship problems. so the second game did this shit too.
i still amazed that not so many people talk about these shameful woke hairy guerrilla gay episode  and if you look carefully this is the love story of the writer director of this show and god knows what we should expect for the rest.
if you did any research on the show before it aired. you would have known this was coming. i don t k ow how anyone could have been tricked lol
they re coming for our kids.
i do hope that bible breath podcast happens  even if its just a now and then thing.
of course they will make the first couple episodes as best they can to get viewership as high as possible. then when you are invested they will start testing the waters.
i knew this will happen so i shipped the whole show!
when u described how the gay men are portrayed in the show  caddy  it reminded me of the gay couple in the proud family. like the black guy u could tell her gay and his husband is white but doesn t act much feminine until he s with him. on top of that  is it just me or does it seem like they make gay couples all lovey dovey like all the time or like 90  of the time. like as if a gay couple is always perfect and barely fight with each other.side note  anyone who hasn t watched the proud family since the 00s and wants to watch the new one  heads up cus they got their agenda in it. i will say it s not the whole time in the show and when it s not then it s actually good  but when it does pop up it s a huge eye roller
@melonie mac  you look incredible with purple   its my fav color    so in regards to the videos topic  i am not surprised with the deception  i 100  grantee the supposed reboot of the lord of the rings tv series is not a reboot its just the 2nd season   that may or may not drown us in woke sauce and bug paste muffins.
exactly what happn d watching it with my gf. it was so awkward because she s the  be an allie  type n  i couldn t give a shit n  don t want to see gay stuff all in my face
so the some of the issues i have with tlou tv series are. 1  the casting choice for ellie is all wrong i do not care what you think she is the wrong fit and you all know it  and i totally see the scenes where ellie is vulnerable and child like and dependent on joel being scrubbed for  girl boss ellie  or just completely ruined by an actress that has always played strong independent female characters.2  speaking of girl bosses it seems to me that the world of tlou is totally run by girl bosses i mean it is 2023 right who needs disgusting men anywaynot even joel atm is a strong male he was completly dominated by tess. 3  the 3rd episode i feel was unnecessary  sure we know from the game that it implied bill was a queen  but to have a whole episode like we got forced in our faces is just unacceptable in my opinion  another issue i have with the 3rd episode is they killed bill at the end which cuts off that whole arc that bill joel and ellie have in the game  sure its not a whole lot of story that is lost but it adds to the overal story and it no longer exists  for the tv series anyway .4  this is just speculation from my part but it would not suprise me if its right on the money but i recon that hbo neil druckman and sony only got to make the show providing it filled the minority quota and checked all the boxes that would appease the very vocal minority  i mean to me it makes sense.lack of violence in a zombie apocolypse strong independent female leads no strong male leads the show must have plenty of lgbtq friendly scenes i m a huge fan of tlou but so far i am not really seeing much that makes me want to continue watching  they are not really staying true  bar one or two scenes  to the source material.
being gay isn t considered anything special  but there are people who believe they should be considered special because they are gay. then there are those who believe a persons sexuality is how they are defined and use it as a vehicle to enlighten the rest of us  missing the irony of their narrow minded approach.
hey pretty melonie sure the chapter 3 was not my cup of tea i skipt some part but in general was good just it would be nice less weird situations in the future cause the game doesnt showed anything like that.
the last of us episode 3 was gross and manipulative by shoving that into the audiences face.  i knew they would do something like this  because of what they did in game 2  which is why i haven t even watched any of that show at all.   once they have shown themselves to be that  type  of people  they have proven they can never again be trusted with anything.
my mother and i are enjoying this series  thus far. the cinematography  the acting  and the pacing has been above average. we skipped episode 3  just because my parents aren t really part of that miniscule demographic. i wish they had stuck with the original 80-hour game  instead of adding a 38-minute love story that doesn t seem realistic in an apocalyptic situation.
i am currently watching 1899 and my plan was to wait until i finish that series before heading to the last of us. with the recent reviews  it seems  i should avoid this show. im curious  to everyone in the comment section and melonie  if you see this or respond  what would you give the last of us  out of 10
jokes on the director i haven t even seen the show and never plan on lol
woah. just found your channel and it s very refreshing to find a young female that is strong enough to voice her opinion that is against the woke culture. keep it up!
this  director  could learn a lot from watching stakeland 2.
proof that its not about entertainment but is all about pushing propaganda.
well i liked the first two episodes and i may still finish the show purely from a completion standpoint but man they are going to be a slog to get through and i m sure as hell not giving season 2 my time.
the only sex scene that was needed and essential to the plot was the sex scene in terminator and it s the only one where i d never really feel awkward while watching with parents  even as a teenager
they want 2 create a fanfic in which joel n bill are a couple weird
that s how a bait and switch works
thats not at all how tv shows work
@ancientflames  its how this show is working
date someone who isnt gross.
the first game was 80 hours long
@philsunderland  not even close. more like 10-15 hours depending on what kind of player you are.
ya know  i already planned not to watch the show until i even play the first game. i guess now the games would be enough!
it s not even a romantic relationship its more a toxic one if you really think about it  frank is manipulative and just takes from bill while bill is a simp and do everything for frank and people cry to this episode and celebrate it like its the best thing ever
i ain t even against gay romances  i just want to care about the characters. i don t care about anyone in this show. it feels sooooooooooo by the numbers with nothing going for it. i do also hate irrelevant filler. thats what this was. that  bow tie  ending was literally the only thing tying it to the main story. aside from the  tricking me into watching a gay romance   i m more mad i got tricked into thinking this was going to be a decent series.
that would be like a volume of a manga that was like   ha ha  tricked you into buying a yaoi.   you can do it  but probably not a good idea for the long term of your project.
good thing i already knew not to bother with any new series on hbo these days to begin with
episode 3 pissed me off so much.
as a gay man i was pissed.why does our sexuality always have to be our defining characteristics.i like how in the game bill sexuality wasnt hinted only at the end.he was a complete jerk thats y his ex left him and committed suicide after being bitten.why did they ruin his character.he finds out his lover was dead after joel finds his note.why kill bill off when he wasnt dead in the game waste of a character.maybe he could have found love in later episodes idk
i too never liked watching racy scenes in almost every single western movie and show lol. that being said  house of the dragon had way less gratuitous sex scenes and naked women than game of thrones  i think. like i can only recall around a handful of times in the first half of the season. it s how the world was depicted by grrm so i can forgive it more  and it s not being thrown in just because  sex always sells amirite  or  sexual freedom is so gratifying  -- i mean in a world where incest is ok  sexy scenes are the least of your worries i think lmaoalso good call on not watching the last of us show cause it is very much inferior to the game and not just because the director tricked people into watching a gay love story. it s just not that good.
will say as a gay man it is very nice to see two gay characters who act like men for once. masculine men and role models for gay men are very lacking and much needed  growing up with the stereotypes is not fun and does a lot of harm.
it s been years since broke back mountain. come on melonie  it s time for basic instinct. hahaha!
i ve neither played the game  unrepaired shattered wrists mean fps games are impossible for me. not that i was any good at them before the wrists getting crunched and broken  but it is a convenient excuse  nor have i watched the show  but i have several friends who loved the game   the game  referring to tlou1 since they view the 2nd game to be an unmitigated offense against the consumer .of these friends one loved the episode three story  this one is a gay friend of mine who lost his long-term partner to cancer a few years ago  so it was going to be emotional for him anyway   but even that one agreed with the overall opinion of the episode  that it wasn t serving any purpose for the story and would have been much better if they d stayed more true to the original game script. my gay friend s comment   it would have done better as the gay lifetime movie it was obviously meant to be. i was really looking forward to irritable bill kicking some sense into the snot nosed punk that isn t remotely like ellie.  i feel cheated that we didn t get that.  the kindest thought a friend voiced about the episode was that the writers underestimated the amount of material they needed for the season  so shoehorning in a completely unrelated love story episode allowed them to pad out the episode count. the biggest complaint i hear from my tlou friends is  who the heck is this kid because she sure as shooting isn t ellie.  the secondary one is that the  cut-rate discount nathan fillion   which is my new favorite descriptive for pablo pascal  playing joel should keep his mando helmet on so he s not expected to emote cos he s not good at it. while i despise zombie stuff  because i already have nightmares too often and don t need to add to that  i always thought that the game sounded cool  even with its sad moments like joel s daughter and frank s note. it s a shame that the show  while it did better than many expected out of the gate  is now stumbling badly. we ll see if they can recover and make the first game season end okay. but no fan of the first game is going to watch season two if it follows the second game.
i bet all the q relationships will get critical acclaim... lookin  at ellie
i just find it hilarious that the current agenda really thinks that the audience needs to be shown the full extent of a gay relationship in order for us to fully understand that they can love  just like us ... human love is human love  they know that  they just take advantage.
i don t think he tricked anyone. we all had that figured out before he got out of the pit.
in the walking dead we had gay characters like aaron and jesus  and they never had any lgbt stereotypes and were beloved. not everyone loves walking dead but these characters are examples of writing representation correctly
if it was tommy and his wife back story i would still hate it  it was werid and uncomfortable  especially from somthing that wasn t in the game at all. but now they get to say  your homophobic if you didn t like the episode   what a weak defense  i don t wanna see two dudes kissing in the first place  i hate watching people kiss in general  you can do whatever you want  i m  slightly religious myself and couldn t care less what people do with there lives   doesn t mean i wanna see what said people are doing  i loved bill in the game  idgaf that he was gay he was a certified badass and one of my favorite video game characters cause of how memorable he is
i don t know what s funnier in the thumbnail  your facial expression or the death note panel!
i was wary about the show  the first 2 episodes were alright but yeah to the bin with this one
this isn t meant rhetorically  i really want to know  why is gratuitous violence okay but gratuitous human intimacy isn t  there was nothing pornographic in the episode  as opposed to how voyeuristic it seems to get on got hotd  so i agree with you there .i was uncomfortable during the scene of intimacy in tlou ep. 3 as well because i just don t like that stuff. the director saying he wanted to trick people into watching it is also weird and that is not something i can respect regardless of the quality of the result. it s all strange and performative  i believe  but it s there and in a vacuum the episode was well-made  though i agree with you that the entire thing is unnecessary to those who have played the game. honestly  it feels like neil druckmann is spitefully trying to rewrite the first game to his liking now that he s finally rid of the guy who was actually responsible for the quality of the first one.
i thought they were just friends in the game. . .
everyone just sees hbo and thinks it can t be anything but amazing  if it didn t have the budget it would be another run of mill zombie show. the fx crew who created the fallen world make the show not the actor s or the writers.
they definitely could have had stuff to adapt from. the whole way going to bills place is  in my opinion  one of the most exiting parts of the game which they could have definitely adapted as part of the show. but nah  let s have an episode that is tonal whiplash compared to the first 2 episodes and what the show was advertised to be and put in a 1 hour gay love story that adds nothing and breaks the character that people who have played the game know and love
i lked denise too  didn t care that she was a lesbian. i found magna and yumiko unlikable and their relationship felt forced and lacked any chemistry.
@user-ld2vu2qi8p  yeah forgot about denise  tara was a love or hate character but it wasn t because she was gay. i wish they did more with magna though  yumiko seemed to be more involved with the story than she was
it depends on the context of the show being made. this show was advertised as a gory horror zombie show so that s what people were expecting the tone to be so people accept that it s going to be gory. but then they hit us with the tonal whiplash of this episode that is so far removed from what the sow advertised that it was a turn off to people who expected a gory zombie show. even more so to fans of the game because they erased   in my opinion  one of the most exiting parts of the game  being all the stuff that joel and ellie went through on the way to bills house in the game
the fact that they have to falsely advertise and trick people into watching it should tell you everything.
even pron sites have been forcing gay propaganda on straight dudes. you literally can t avoid it. you click on porn for a straight dude and you will get tons of adds filling the side of the screen with toys showing dudes jacking off. it s the creepiest thing. they try to pretend it s just advertising for male toys but it is very obviously them trying to force gay pron on straight men. it literally made me give up on pron  for the better.
it doesn t matter if it was handled with enough subtlety to feel  earned  it just means the show will gradually keep getting more and more woke. just like the boys.
the craziness of calling you a phobe for tricking you to watch something without your consent. isn t that a form of grape
you can t trick me into watching that crap  if something like that comes on the screen i immediately shut it off or leave the room
the last of us is one of my favourite games of all time  but i knew they d cram bill s  defining attribute  down our throats in the tv series. this is why i haven t even bothered to start watching it.i don t care that they put this nonsense in movies or tv shows  but just don t expect me to watch it.
yes  i would have watched it anyways!
good thing i stay away from that revolting show
i felt the love scene was awkward and was a lot longer than needed to be  actually they didn t really need to actually film it  they could of just had them wake up in the morning and people just know what happened.  i did feel the relationship after was okay and they could of achieved the same emotion with a traditional relationship.  the show was just awards show bate  because that s what you need to qualify for awards now.
the story that was told in this episode was pretty heartfelt.. that being said  i definitely fast forwarded thru the ridiculously long sex scene.. like wtf man  the kiss was enough to get the point across..
yeah they should have done what they did in the game eluded to it and just let us fill in the blanks
i knew there were going to be issues when i started hearing how they were avoiding violence. it s a piece of post apocalyptic fiction with zombies and they tried to give the line of  it s not a zombie story it s a drama . i enjoyed episodes 1 and 2 but not enough to have been forced through episode 3. it was intensely boring. the audience that is going to tune into a zombie show isn t interested in some lame love story even gay straight or anything in between. on the whole we want to see the zombies  the affect on the world  and how the characters figure out how to survive. we don t need hour long episodes that are completely disconnected from the story we actually tuned in for.
watch our zombie show! we have gheiz in it! .
same feelings on it!
how did he trick us  it was the 3rd episode  we were all going to watch it regardless of it having a gay couple or not  and it was a fantastic episode. i didn t like the start of the episode  mostly because i thought they were going to kill each other  and part becausse i don t want to see two guys getting it on. they didn t spend a lot of time on this  and the end was pretty good. i don t think it was out of place.
here s the thing if someone does something like this once. tricking people into watching something  they didn t want to see.  they hurt their show or they hurt that show or movie. because they tricked people once you have to ask how many people are going to continue to watch it. along with how many people are going to stop watching it because they don t want to be tricked again. just like the hole black christmas thing a remake by definition. is a retelling of the original story in an updated manner with small changes but the core story is the same. black christmas 1974 has its own original story it only has one remake that is black xmas  christmas 2006. because it has the same core story as black christmas 1974. but black christmas 2019 has a completely whole new original story never seen or told in the history of hollywood.  but  they are calling it a remake of black christmas 1974. when black christmas 2019 is not an cannot be a remake by definition of a remake.  because  it has a completely whole new original story that has nothing to do with the story in black christmas 1974.  the only way black christmas 2019 can be a remake of black christmas 1974 is if it had the same story. from black christmas 1974 but since black christmas 2019 has a new original story. it is not an cannot be a remake of black christmas 1974.  for a for what happens when you trick  people .now for a toke on sex scenes an nudity in things for no reason. on a audio commentary i believe it was on the blu-ray of john carpenter s halloween. this is backed up on other audio commentaries as well like on the one on the shout scream factory collector s edition of halloween 3 season of the witch. along as on the shout  scream factory collector s edition of  john carpenter s halloween with tommy lee wallace.  they all take about john carpenter s take on sex scenes an nudity on screen. because he hated filming it an because he says an i feel the same way. that sex scenes and nudity don t belong on screen unless they are adding to the story of the movie or show.  that s why in john carpenter movies it s only shown to show someone is distracted thinking about that kinda thing.  it s you see it then it s over quickly as possible just enough to show the danger that. they would notice if they whore paying attention  so it shows that the people are in danger.   but needless nudity and sex scenes add nothing to the story or movie or show unless it s that kind of movie or show.
pedro pascal was the reason i never gave this show a chance.
yeah  as a catholic  i am just going to skip episode 3. i ll watch  2 and skip to  4. i just cannot for the life of me watch it. i have unwanted ssa and this is not good for my soul. that s my convictions  but everyone is free to watch or not watch as they see fit.great video melonie.
i never give these lunatics a chance to that. i knew that it couldn t be good for too long.
grooming tactics.
definitely my least favorite episode thus far. i knew episode 3 was gonna be the  bill episode . so i was really looking forward to some funny banter between bill and ellie like they have in the game. but unfortunately  it never happened. not a bad episode  but definitely not what i wanted.
some ironically have a warning about real life being different and  respecting any partners. like porn sites are in any moral place to lecture people.
hey thanks dude! newly subscribed  iv seen you around thou  keep up the good work!
exactly  why people are not middle ground   they are either obsessed with ideas and they preach and force it  or hate the idea and reject it completely even good parts  immature behaviour..we as a society are going to not nice places
people don t like the episode because it s tonal whiplash from how the show was advertised as well as how the first 2 episodes were. as someone who played the game  this episode also adds nothing to the overall story. we could have got more bonding between joel and ellie  and had them get a little closer with eachother  and their journey to bills place. but no  erase all that  make an episode that adds nothing overall that also breaks the character that people already know and love from the game. they could have adapted the game and added snippets of his life with frank before and people probably would have been happy about it. we did not need or want a hour long episode of his life.
voyeurism and conditioning in one episode  wokeism just like i called it before first episode even aired. they also admitted to tricking the audience into liking a race-swapped character.
aw ok so erica ballin still won t admit that she s supposed to take me out on a lunch date after my job interview at her office which is now on west street...
we knew about bill s relationship in the game it was brief  but there as you can tell talking about it hurts him. we didn t need half an episode dedicated to two characters who aren t in it for a majority of the show.
they didn t trick me  cause i m not watching any of that crap. never played the game  but everything i ve seen of this  they have changed almost every single character to the point it does not even look like the same property
why is  preference  protected  why is going down on a dude a preference but p ing on a b tch a  fetish    rip patricethank you for being a voice of reason  i watched this episode with a straight woman who was totally uncomfortable as well.  it s not whether he was or wasn t  it was shockingly graphic for the sake of being 2023. i didn t play the game so this show is on a short leash at best for me. god bless  keep at em.
i m ok with intimate scenes if they help the story  but they rarely do. they often don t need so much gratuitous displays of what s happening. i m also fine with socializing in many ways with gay dudes  but i find it physically repulsive to see two guys kiss. but i am wondering  did the show generally stay faithful to the game  the witcher did not  which is why i haven t bothered to watch it yet.
i don t mind the episode honestly  although the bedroom scene was a bit excessive . i just find it stupid that they killed off bill and basically deleted a whole game chapter that should have been adapted.
they did and some people took it hook  line and sinker. and they have too big of an ego to go  whoops .
would be cool if more women had a personality like this  serisouly.
it was literally freaking disgusting. may be in the empire of lies      where there are such things as  drag queen story time  for children   they don t understand how sick and deviated that scene is for normal and healthy audiences that are not specting to be  surprised  by that kind of scenes
don t they celebrate assisted soo soo too   so glad i am not watching it. i gave up on entertainment being entertaining.
they should of stuck to the games version and just done ellies dlc backstory as the love story later on for tv show. this whole episode was just neil druckmann being a fuckwit to rile up the crowd that didn t like part 2 and abby.
i tuned out at this scene. at least he didn t wait until episode 23 i guess. lol
there s a seven foot tall kid that looks like a dumpster compactor  walking around the court yard and parking lot. he seems to get paid through lunch hours. make sure the cable bill comes out of his check. or his girlfriend that keeps calling during our breaks over here...
i didn t like the first episode but i gave it a chance because there isn t really anything new worth watching. the second episode was a bit better but they lost me completely on the 3rd. i didn t even watch it. i waited for reviews to be out and i m glad i did. not only i know where the series is going but it looks like the road there is going to be more of the same. in the meantime i ll keep rewatching old good series worth the time.
fool me once  shame on you  fool me twice  shame on me.  don t let this happen twice.  stop watching.
that s hollyweird for you
if only they had followed the video game and added a bit more humor to the revealing that bill was indeed gay. in the game they are low key about the bill s sexuality  the way we find out is through ellie s curiosity when she finds a gay pron mag in the back seat of the blue truck bill gives them. all the tlou live action had to do was copy that video game scene and not make a 1hr  gaybear romance lol
you re speaking my language  having not played the game  i definitely felt duped into watching this episode under the impression that the two guys were going to create conflict versus a passionate  long-term relationship. that said  i maintain hope that the story gets better  but so far it s just falling short making it tough to rationalize the  price of admission  imo.
i don t even have hbo and i m certainly not going to get it to watch this.  i ve long questioned my netflix subscription but then they come out with a gem like arcane.  also  i just got done watching a anime about vikings called vinland saga.   it s not bad.  different if nothing else.  sort of a slow burn at times and there s one episode in the first season  that i just finished  that sort of goes up its own butt with pseudo-philosophical nonsense but other than that  it s an interesting character story.
that is just homophobic. this also has nothing to do with the show  there isn t a sex scene
i like you melonie but tbh this episode was fine. it kept the same theme and gave an alternate ending to bill s relationship. the theme being that joel allowing love back into his life will give him purpose and  save  fulfill him by the end of the story  i am talking about the story of the first game only . it will also greatly contrast with the ending of the show when joel will be as selfish as bill  but in a more twisted way  both refusing to respect their loved ones wishes in the end.
i  too  hate sex scenes in shows and films and this would have me shutting it off.
those infected sure must respect your gayness and give you preferential treatment huh .oh wait a sec  who are the two character who not only survive tlou  but also are ignored by the clickers who instead would only attack joel during gameplay  bill and ellie  the two gay characters!
hi melonie i hope your enjoying your weekend thusfar
the worst part is this is better written then the  relation between joel and ellie.
the first half was not something i like  actually i skipped through once i saw them naked in a bed. but the end of the relationship was pretty well done. straight or gay the relationship felt believable and well done. and i think writers should focus on that if they want to battle homophobia  instead of tricking people into watching gay sex.
i had to watch an episode of an apocalypse where a man caught a man. yet somehow the man he caught caught him...for 20 years...home depot was raided but he had strawberries 16 years later  where was his veggies coming from for his normal meals   not just carrots whoever wrote this has never really entered a hardware store let alone played the games. xdseason 2 got approved but no one likes last of us 2 that much for specific issues...
i m so happy i didn t give this show a chance.
if this was an attempt at a trick  it was a bad attempt. i started fast-forwarding at the piano scene.also  the way this little  love story  ends is pretty gross - there s co-dependent  and then there s  i literally can t live without you.  there were some interesting themes of co-dependency  controlling behavior  etc. that could have been explored  but of course they wouldn t do that  because they re too woke to accurately depict reality.
i wouldn t have watched it if i knew ... and i haven t seen it yet ... and it s now off my list.
didn t trick me  cause i didn t watch this garbage show.
i just hate these sexual scenes in movies and other media. if it is only for few seconds  it is ok  but it must have purpose in story or characters arc. i don t want watch more than few seconds of sex  which applies for everyone  not only man on man action . and i feel after game of thrones  there are a lot more of this scenes everywhere and they are really bad i would say every time. these writers could tell in few dialogues  that these two men are together and then move on. it isn t science. in subtle hints they could tell audience everything we need to know about them. but no  of course they made about them whole episode. this is even one of the reasons  why i didn t watched all of game of thrones. because there was too many sex scenes and a lot of them was man on man.
the episode was well produced but let s not forget the key point here is that it s a completely unnecessary filler episode. it shouldn t have been in this series because it exists solely to say  haha we made a gay episode and tricked you into watching it.  it also shows that they couldn t create enough strength in the main characters and the main story to carry the series. i didn t come to this show to watch  random stories from the last of us world.  i came to watch the joel and ellie story. how many more filler episodes will be in this show
we really didnt needed to see that tbh. they could have done in like they walking in the room shuts down the door and everyone could understoond this.
in the meantime.....   i won t obey. ..... lol! you cut yourself off there a little too soon. yeah  i tried watching game of thrones and hosue of the dragon. i couldn t. there is too much sexuality and cursing really. like in every sentence i hear someone stating some sort of cursing or talking about sex. i would say in every episode there is something sexual in it. one reason why i have not finished it and only watched clips on youtube  but even then stopped watching them. those shows are not for me. i don t really care for them. one reason to stick with a classic  m.a.s.h. or something else.i still see some sort of sexual stuff within those older shows. the thing is you have to make sure you are aware of such things  and do not fall prey to them. if you do fall prey  run. run fast and divert your eyes from those offenses. i know it states in the bible to run away and divert your eyes. king david is an example on what can happen to you if you don t divert your eyes and or run away.
melanie mac speaking those facts
happy saturday
good to know  i can just skip episode 3 at this point. i thought episode 1 was ok. nothing groundbreaking.
it was such a weird episode and it s completely changed the story  i am for nuance and seeing something different but this was so strange. i knew what hbo was up too when bella ramsay was cast and the actress for sarah  i ll pass. velma should ve taken down hbo on its own  now this show is helping.
same lol
me either. the whole purpose of this show is to put abby on screen beating joel to death with the golf club.
happy sunday
spot on melonie
it feels like they do this kind of stuff for the sake of doing it and usually there is no real need for it to be in there. i m not against peoples inclinations but i don t like it when it s forced in my face in the high capacity that is has done in recent times
regarding sex scenes  all sex scenes can be skipped because they are just story-padding hack holdovers from the pre-2-girls-1-cup  free-porn days of the past. this was back when it was still titillating and shocking  stunning and brave to the pervs  to see people bone in cinema. there are exceptions to the rule   see jason biggs getting it on with an apple pie in  american pie  but they are very few and far between.tlou was more of a novella-length story  glued together with great gameplay and an outstanding soundtrack. the narrative was well-paced and tightly constructed as it was. this episode is really just more sodomite propaganda from our gay oppressors.
i ll be honest  i fast forwarded through most of that episode. i also fast forwarded through apollo and the hooker s relationship in bsg. they were both filler and i have stuff to do.on another note  the gist of their relationship seems to do the opposite of what they wanted. it makes gay relationships look hopeless. they would have no children and therefore no future. the best they could get was to not die violently. not to mention that it makes homosexuality appear as a luxury in a post apocalyptic situation.
it s funny how some people get triggered when i say that the game handles the story better. and i haven t even mentioned those corn moments but they have to bring it up
i ve not watched the show because i already knew it would change my perception of what the last of us is from the beginning when i heard the intro was changed....
the problem with the episode is the overall story detracted so much from the og plots   themes  making it an even bigger filler   so unnecessarily time wasting. also  personally i would say it kinda negatively promote  lover s suicide    it would have been a better interesting scenario if bill actually stayed alive when joel   ellie visited their town. idk  maybe this  progressive  people really do love euthanizing old people...
i haven t seen it. thank you for the warning.  and drink some water. hahaha
the show is getting better by episode and i feel that you should really watch the second episode in particular. as a hetero male  i was not offended by the third episode and you could certainly skip the parts that you might find offensive. as far as being tricked by it  the guy who said that is delusional. in the bigger picture  gay and trans people are still a very small percentage of the overall population  yet the seem to be shoved down our throats constantly by the mainstream media and i am tired of it. as a regular person  i want to see regular people on the big and small screen.
call me crazy but frank has more of joel s personality than pedro.
i liked the show up until that point. it s crazy how much they deviated from the source material to devote an entire episode to something that was extremely minor in the og game. the agenda is so obvious sheesh.
you do know about this neat feature called  fast forwarding  right  comes in  pun intended  handy with scenes like that. i don t like being  tricked  into watching that shit. gay characters are fine as long as we don t have to see them being gay. same with regular sex scenes. i say if you want sex  watch porn. i have never seen one example of a movie or show where sex was such an important part that it would completely ruin the entire thing if it was cut.
didnt trick me  stopped after episode 1        _   _    nice death note hoodie
i had no clue why i had to watch the brokeback mountain in a zombie game themed tv show all of a sudden. i still have no clue. it was so stupid it s insane.
joke s on him  some of us hardcore fans of the original game aren t watching squat.  the bad cosplay approach to the casting choices was a blatant red flag.
i always told my mom how awesome tlou was. when the series was announced i told her about it and we were so excited to watch it together.since i ve played the game i assumed it was safe for us to watch it together. she loved the first two episodes however i had to get up and turn off the third episode. sorry but watching two dudes make out  go to bed and then start going down on each other is not something i ll do with my mother sitting next to me. if that makes me  homophobic   i couldn t care less. i don t even watch straight sex scenes with my mom on the room.also  at least in my opinion  it didn t add anything to the story  if someone watches the entire series but not the bill and frank scenes they probably wont even notice that there is an episode missing.
i knew it! i knew the woke stuff would join this thing and make a dumbsterfire
come on melonie  it was blatantly obvious this was going to happen in this show  not sure about craig mazin but this totally neil druckmann agenda  he did it with tlou part 2  tlou  left behind  and a few implications of it in uncharted 4. it s been said that druckmann wanted to put this in topic in the original game  it was but subtlety  but was reluctant to make obvious due to any backlash that could come from it. im sure this will not be the end of this checkmark boxing this season or even the next season  i feel it will get a lot worst. that s why i m not hoping for a tlou part 3 because after the experience in part 2  it might as well just have the flag of the lgbtqia  on the cover. that game is not needed just like part 2 wasn t needed  just come up with a new ip naughty dog  then you can include all lgbtqia  characters and agendas you want  just stop inserting it into tlou  the first game was spectacular without it.
lol  tease at the end
sodomite  - glad to see someone using the correct terminology!
joel was not written well at all in the show! just from the first episode i was over it  they made him such a beta
@meloniemacgoboom   true. they giving him character development in the show. but his character already pre build in a game. he was already a fighter. this is why he survived for soo long.
just the thought of this stuff makes me nauseous. i hate this society so much.
to play devils advocate to this video  i don t think you can  trick  anyone unless they have no experience of tv shows pushing narratives in different ways  this episode could be called a filler episode or just an episode that takes a break from the main plot to get a different perspective  a side story or character study. this has been in many tv shows and to say  i think it s wrong to trick someone to view a romantic scene  i mean you can click off  turn the tv off  phyiscally walk away to another room. this show isn t handcuffing you and pulling your eyes back like clockwork orange.
very graphic sex scenes are immersion breaking.  you re watching the show or movie and you re absorbed in it.  all of a sudden  you re shifting in your chair uncomfortably  you re giving people around you side eye  so on and so forth.  i m not a puritan  but i don t even eat popcorn during movies.  i like to get to the theatre a little early so i can snack on popcorn and sour patch kids before the lights come down.  when the movie comes on  i want to focus.the other issue is the weird need some gay people seem to have to be validated by everyone.  here s the thing  i have no issue with the gays.  twenty years ago  i was canvassing in my home state of ma trying to get people to support gay marriage.  i m pro that.but you could badger me for a thousand years and i will never co-sign certain  acts  that gay guys do.  i m never not going to think that s not weird behavior.  the good news is  gay guys don t need my permission.  so  you do you.  it s not even a gay thing. there are things some heterosexual couples do that i think is bizarre.  i m never going to think it s  normal  for a dude to invite a large black guy to plow his wife.there s just some things that i think are messed up.  call me old fashioned.so  trying to shove gay sex down my throat     isn t going to do anything but annoy me.  people that think gay sex is deviant are never going to applaud that behavior.  and in fact  trying to get the approval of straight people is counterproductive.  a big part of functioning in society is the ability to compartmentalize sexuality.  if i m talking to my kids teacher at parent  teachers night  i m not thinking about what she does in the bedroom.  it would be impossible to function in society if we couldn t separate individuals from their sexuality.  the insistence of these leftist activist gays on trying to  normalize  fundamentally abnormal sexual behavior through some sort of bizarre exposure therapy  makes it almost impossible to treat gay people in the community like everybody else.if these people actually cared about representation and having positive depictions of gay people in the media they would have told bill s story the way it plays out in the games.  bill is a very well liked character  even among us toxic gamers .  it s almost like hollywood weirdos are playing a sick game and they get a certain amount of points for inserting deviant images into their programs.  because  honestly  they could have had a good gay character that people would have connected with  instead  they opted for shock value that was over in one episode.  gay will never be  normal   because the leftist media won t let it be.  they have to make every guy holding a guys hand on film into a watershed moment that will change everything forever!the new m. night shyamalan movie actually does it right.  he depicts a gay couple and their  presumably  adopted daughter like  shock  people.  they only address the gay thing one or two times in passing.
i m unable to watch this unless i have sky tv. and i m certainly not going to get that just to watch this.
tricking someone into watching says alot about the act  the people who tricked us  and the project as a whole. the moment you pull something like that  you basically are showing you don t respect the audience at all. not to mention  it s going to make people hate the project and those kinds of things more. it also says volumes about their view on the lgbt  they themselves treat it as something they have to trick ppl into watching and then doubling back to explain away. if you thought it was truly a beautiful and righteous thing  you d just put it in and let the scene moments speak for themselves. that what happens when good writing stands on its own merit
your right the game is better   i knew the show was gonna be woke and less like the game specially  with the change of dialogue  they really mellowed out ellie and sarah   they don t cuss as much as in the game  i know that s a little thing  but that s still kind of the basis of their character. and when you remove character  you have a boring character.i stoped watching mid way through episode 2 .
lgbtqia xyz123
melonie you should watch game of thrones and just fast-forward past the love scenes. it is a great show until the last season.
i commend you for not wanting to watch smut. it s completely unnecessary and often gross and uncomfortable. bravo for sticking to your values.
the thumbnail
i love how they glorified suicide. of all the egregious liberties they took with bill and frank from the game pales in comparison when they made their deaths some romeo and juliet rip off.
they didn t trick me because i knew this crap would be a thing and wasn t watching it anyway.
i don t mind gay characters or gay relationships. if it s a good story  i can be emotionally involved and even relate with the romance  because that s a human thing first and foremost... as long as they don t engage in gratuitous victimization and demonization of straight people. the most important is the focus on good character development and good storytelling.
i just came to the realization watching the third episode of the last of us this isn t the same world i fell in love with on the ps3 this is a mediocre paint-by-numbers sanitized replica that seems to not want to put infected into its show. i gave them a chance and they failed he didn t trick me i thought the episode was boring the game just does it so much better i didn t even like the actress that played tess her accent kept on going in and out there s no qualified americans that can be playing these parts  they made a very interesting story of survival and grief into a boring drama i ll stick with the first game. and i thought the love story was cheesy as heck i basically skipped all those scenes in the episode 3 i wonder if they changed other things for political correctness mainly the suicide scene i kind of think they did.
lol you called it they def went off the rails and its hilarious the woke mob is praising this episode like its best thing to happen in film.
i didn t watch it cause i knew it was comingthey ruined the second game characters so knew they d do the same in the seriesalso people shouldn t get graphic with anyone besides their spouse  i watched house of dragon but used the pvr and skipped over the scenes you mentioned lol
call me a prude but to me intimacy of any type should stick to romance or drama focused movie shows. you can argue this is a drama but then you have zombies in it too  which is the sell for the show.whether gay  straight or whatever  everytime the characters start having sex i lose interest in the production and start timing how much time i am wasting watching what could be hinted at in 5 seconds. if i wanted to watch characters people having sex i can view that online with specifics catered to individual kinks.so episode 3 for me was when are joel and ellie going to get to the firework factory !watching a genre shift of a zombie survival to a hallmark drama. meanwhile a story i am interested in is happening elsewhere.
as a muslim its really nice  almost refreshing  to see there are sill people like you who uphold their morals   denies these kind of disgusting agenda that they are trying so hard to shove it down our throats. thank you.
it s kind of like how he ruined the last of us part two! a lot of people have made it known how they hated that game  how they ruined the franchise because the first game was amazing! but then again  that s neil druckmann for you!
guess you haven t even seen this episode.
so did you like this epiosde
the woke agenda did a good job at making christians and muslims allies  we re all sick of this mess haha! thank you for the kind words  i appreciate you
i am an old school naughty dog fan and really liked the first tlou game. so i started watching this show with my family a couple weeks ago and i gotta say  episode 3 was very uncomfortable and overall felt kinda pointless  spoiler alert if anyway cares lol  because bill and frank both die and joel   ellie just end up taking his truck lol. bill was just a side character in the game anyways but still i feel the game handled this way better  he was around a little longer and kinda bitter probably partly because his  partner  was already dead. i feel like this entire episode was just to push lgbt stuff.. hopefully they stick to the rest of the first games story from now on. i mean bills character was already gay  okay yeah we all get that but to make the audience sit through a whole flashback where there were at least 3 intimate scenes between them -_-  that i know of anyways  ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit of it . it s just pointless to the overall story. the first game is about joel   ellie and how joel starts viewing her as a daughter since he lost his. we never knew ellie was gay until the dlc and then the 2nd game  because ones sexual preference and seeing them get sexual with another character isn t that important to the overall story. i also felt like they did a great disservice to joel s character in the 2nd game by killing him off so quick. not only did it seem completely opposite of his character with how it was done but he was the main in the first game  you could have let the players play as him a little more and flesh the story out before killing him. would have been interesting seeing ellie and him work through the decision he made at the end of the first game  and maybe even her trying to find a way to still make a vaccine...but nope.. instead they try and go for shock value  that didn t work to well  and you go on a quest of revenge and also get to play as one of the most unliked characters in video game history that killed the main of the first game.. i believe since neil druckmann got promoted at naughty dog it has been more focused on feminism  lgbt  and pushing a political agenda. this is why the first game will most likely always be the best in the series and why i m cautious of any future releases of naughty dog...naughty dog seems like it s becoming a flat out unpleasant dog.
they didnt even follow the game for that episode.
going to disagree with you there melonie. hotd employs its sex scenes in a non gratuitous manor. as a christian myself  i see a fine line between sexual scenes employed meaningfully to make a statement story advancement and gratuity. yes  game of thrones in the later seasons employed sex  nudity  rape  etc. gratuitously because they just wanted to shock and awe people to generate views. hotd is cut from a different cloth though. i can t think of a single scene it employs that didn t serve a purpose to advance character development the story in a meaningful way  and not for the purpose of just shocking the audience  everything is done tactfully and not nearly as excessively as its predecessor. this is something shad brooks talked about and why he tuned out of got and he is a mormon  he couldn t tolerate the gratuity in the show after a while. i don t think it  rots  your brain in this case. something like hotd employs a lot of this stuff to either purposefully make you uncomfortable  because it s a character piece on imperfect people   or to highlight what motivates specific characters and what gets them from point a to point z  we re dealing with a story that begins its first season covering 20ish years in a medieval society that is similar  yet very different from our own . yes  i get it  we live in a time where people have a very hard time separating fiction from reality  and often put media on a pedestal they shouldn t. but frankly  something like hotd is pure entertainment to me  it s a fantasy political drama  it s very far removed from our world  so there isn t much to take from its story to apply to my life.now  you can dislike it  that s fine. but  there is a difference when you call it gratuitous. it either is  or isn t gratuitous. in this case  hotd hasn t employed gratuitous sex nude scenes yet because there is a purpose in the story character development behind those scenes.
tricks on them. i didnt watch the entire show. ha ha!
trick  how can you be tricked if you are full aware that it was gonna happen  and if you didn t watch it cause  fuck naughtydog
wow  what a way to tell on yourself that you only care about views and not the audience by literally telling on yourself lol. great take melonie  you never seize to impress. take care and hope you re enjoying the warmer weather here today.
i was gonna sign up for hbo to watch if this stayed away from alphabet pandering. the good thing is that i saved my money.  i had a feeling neil couldn t resist not leaving out his flaming fantasies. i m so disappointed.
oh  well.  i don t have hbo max.  or hbo for that matter.  too expensive.
and so many people called it masterpiece  best episode ever made  it wasn t even well paced and things happening because plot requires them to happen. in contrast with the other 2 episodes  it was the worst one. if you want to make a love story  fine do it  if you want to make two guys boning  fine too  but don t make it about an hour long when the show is about joel and ellie.this episode was a major let down  i was so excited when i get to watch it hoping  well  they are getting into the meat and potatoes  something is gonna happen soon  to never deliver. it truly felt they were saving money for cgi and stuff for later episodes while also shielding themselves from criticism with politics
from what i have heard it s like broke back mountain
stop whining.
the old bait and switch. who saw this coming  besides everyone that pays attention to  the message   to be said in drinker s voice using reverb  being put into everything   and just as predictably as always  its in episode 3
i m waiting for the remake on pc  i could play it on my ps5 but i d rather play it on better hardware. i didn t notice any hints at sexuality in the first game on ps4 so why this needs to be such a forced issue now is beyond me.
thanks for the heads up!
final fantasy 7 had the same forced crap in it. i was so disgusted  with no way to skip it. i stopped playing  uninstalled  traded it in for several other games.
i m not watching this episode because my brother loves the show and he will force me to watch it  i love the channel though so lots of love just can t watch it before i see the train wreck for myself
they didn t trick you. you were simply unable to come to the obvious conclusion that the last of us is and will always be woke. it won t stop being woke. the people that continue to watch last of us are too hopeless to save  like star wars fans.
quick question  ms. like you  i m not too keen seeing this type of stuff on tv  even though i have no problems with others who want to. so  i was wondering  do you watch old films  films from the 40s! i do  and some of them have a far more refreshing perspective!
i ll say this i wouldn t say tricked because we the fans from the first game we knew bill had a loveruhhh i believe he said a male loverbut technically i would say we were forced to watch this shit.but i haven t even watched the show i ain t interested in it.
i think the episode was done brilliantly and the game has been always lgbt  gay  anything and bill was kinda gay  i don t care really  i respect everyone the same  however  there are things that i don t like  one of them are romance  hetero or homo  i just don t like it  secondly  i m not a fan of inside stories of non lead characters  one piece anyone   i stopped seeing that anime because of that   and i m not the only actor that don t like romance on scenes  there are several others  if i have to do it i will  is ky job  but liking it  not so much  and usually when i see romance or filling with stories of minor characters on video games  series or movies  i just get a good fast-forward. best
find way to make the vaccine maybe i am just being petty or just bored but its funny fans would probably be fine with that plotline despite even before the 2nd games stuff people pointed out there was no way the vaccine was even viable since you realistically cannot make a vaccine from fungus and others claimed the lab audiologs said they tried other immuned people  no one has ever presented this to me but maybe it existed in older versions  and it didn t work.and when part 2 came out and the game tried to give some sympathy to abbys side of the story people ranted about how dumb it is since her father had to know the cure wouldn t have likely existed and if nd claimed it did thats bullcrap.albeit neil apparently did confirm it would ve worked.ambiguity would be better but i guess it does raise the stakes more but whatever.
naughty dog in arguable way started to go down from creativity to a focus on cinematic narrative rather than anything innovative or unique.i mean i like both last of us games i know shocking but for some reason as petty and dumb i feel sometimes i legit can t find any agreement with the last of us 1 is a masterpiece or 2 of course either.nd i felt made honestly better games before with jak and crash and uncharted because story was decent in those but gameplay and innovation also mattered.although pt 2 s gameplay i think is better at least more fun.
@chandllerburse737  i see what you re saying  it seems a lot of games  at least bigger companies  are going a more cinematic or more story focused route. which that can be cool at times especially if its a captivating story but gameplay definitely matters too. jak and daxter and uncharted will always be some of my favorites.
@chandllerburse737  interesting  i haven t heard that. i mean at least a little more interaction between joel and ellie on why he made the decision to kill the doctors would have been nice  since she was so upset when she found out. and then what they do now  like if it s even possible to come up with a cure. i just think it would have been interesting to get more clarification on that in the 2nd game imo since it was such a big focus of the first. also i have seen a clip of the end of the first game  where if you just sit there and don t shoot the doctors people will come in and kill joel anyways.
@sirzakattack2691  i mean they were going to kill joel if he resisted anyhow. they all had their motives and it was portrayed as more or less grey and people hated how the second game felt more black and white but people themselves treat joel as black and white since so many still basically critique the game for making joel a villain when he was always a good person which is not the intention of the first i doubt that.he s a survivor he s not meant to be a hero or a bad guy.he s like james sunderland from silent hill 2 except arguably thats more black and white since that game focuses entirely on well his guilt of an action but otherwise joel is a grey character.
@sirzakattack2691  comparatively nd s biggest friendly rival insomniac i think has done better by sticking to story and gameplay focus. spider-man isn t amazing but its fun and a decent story for that character.ratchet and clank is still alive and well and spyro was spyro.and sucker punch is even better with ghost of tsushima and infamous clearly focusing both on story and gameplay in a neat way.but nd slowly focused less on gameplay it felt as their games went on.
yeah. tricked. i highly doubt you knew there was going to be a whole episode on bill and frank s gay romance..
@patrickhenry8425  yes i did. there will also be a gay romance in episode 7.
@asourcreamcitizen9620  i can t wait to skip that one just like i ve skipped the first 3 soo far.
omg dude you should totally dm her and ask her out to a 40s film
i think it was handled well in the show. i liked bill as a character and this gave me a bit more of it. would i have preferred if he lived longer  yea but i thought it was well written. and he didn t change a lot  still gruff and rough.
the focus of the episode was all wrong. it s not the issue of them being homosexuals  it s that nothing interesting was going on during the episode. only one infected got killed by a trap and the raiders were too incompetent to breach bill s gates. the whole episode was just focusing on the romance between bill and frank  i think that was his name  even if i were watching an episode of this featuring a straight male and female couple  i d feel super bored. less making out and more action is what this episode needed. if i wanted to watch romance  i wouldn t choose to watch a horror tv series.
y know  i ve just come to expect that people will shoehorn in lgbt stuff  and i think that most people are the same.for people who maybe aren t familiar with the original game  this probably really looks shoehorned. and the reaction would have been   sure  whatever  comes with the territory of modern entertainment to pander to the gays n  stuff. but when you say  trick people into watching   i don t care what context  that is a bad image. if most  phobic  right-leaning people have consigned to the fact that they re gonna find tokenized lgbt in media  what did you need to trick them about  saying  trick them  is a condescending  i m smarter than you  tone and it gives us the impression that we are being manipulated.here s a good tip  if you seek to manipulate your audience into making decisions and then point out how you ve manipulated them regardless of whether or not they would have made that decision on their own  otherwise they aren t gonna be your audience for long.
i had to fast forward the intimacy scene between the two men  and when i thought i had fast forward enough  it kept on  and so did i  hit the fast forward for 5 second  thought i was good this time but fck  i was only half way. i don t know why da fck it had to be this long. it made me uncomfortable for the simple fact that it s not natural for my eyes to see  and if its offending for some poeple that i can t...don t care
this comment is going to get me banned the last of us unironically promotes gays committing suicide as a good thing.wtf guys.also on a series note if they think this was a big deal  in a different sense   they obviously never heard of telltales the walking dead  clementine and lee everett. that was done much more beautifully and was far more impactful.this could ve been a story about a man and his wife  or  like previously mentioned  lee and clementine  a father and their  adopted  child  but they made it gay for virtue signaling.
this doesn t surprise me.  i ve been done with the franchise since the left behind dlc revealed ellie to be a lesbian.  after that and showing ellie having a lesbian relationship in the sequel and having two transgender characters in abby and lev  yes  i will always consider abby transgender because it looks way more like a man than a woman   are people really that shocked they would include a gay romance in an episode of the show
i wouldn t have watched if i knew. i did not finish it at all
if you are watching last of us the show after the evil they did with abby smash in last of us 2 then you got exactly what you deserved.  i do not understand why anyone would continue to support this series after the whole fiasco of last of us 2.
i saw this coming. after all i had heard of the sequel of the game and the people involved in the making of this series  it was enough to make me wait for it to end before i gave it a shot. nice try suckers.
i actually really liked that episode  tho me and my wife called it pretty quick
the director feeling the need to trick people sounds like an insult to gay people  honestly. that he didn t trust in people to be willing to watch  of their own accord  it has to sneak up on you.
hi melonie you were great on fnt did not know you liked the character of swamp thing
say you hate fans without saying you hate fans...ps  you can watch walkthrough of a game - it s better spent 9-10 hours than on this... show based on the game...
feels like i m the only one who thought episode 3 was trash. this week s episode better be damn good and make up for the pointless filler snoozefest that was last week.
talk about writing dishonestly. tricking your audience into watching a sex scene between two side characters with no bearing on the main plot is what you get with hack writing practices  no matter the character s sexual orientation. in the original game  bill and frank s relationship was done way better and brought a bit of doubt on the baring of human intimate relationships in the world of the last of us.
i don t mind having some of the flashbacks but for it be an entire filler episode
ok really    it was an amazing episode.  love us love...especially in a lonely post apocalyptic world. people need to grow up...
well i don t have hbo max at the moment. i may pick it up in march. but i will skip episode 3 because to me it doesn t add anything to the story. in the game it was implied  and it wasn t in your face. hell  none of the straight characters has romance scenes. i mean i know joel s brother was married but there is no kissing or making out. no  they reserve the first kissing scene for gay people. because neil is a left wing nut. even in the second game  the only romance scenes were between ellie and dina. oh  the other scene was with neil slamming abby from behind  just because that added so much to the character and story.
nice take. this statement from the director is more evidence of  the homosexual normalization agenda in hollywood. if they had any gonads they would ve put it in the first episode.  i watched the first two and was like meh. happy to skip the third. might skip the rest.
i didn t feel  tricked . in fact i thought this was a good episode. was it necessary  not really but it s nice that we got to see some characters living a good life with one another in this post apocalyptic world. and i didn t get the feeling that something  woke  was being shoved in my face. it felt like a genuine relationship. its like another youtuber had said  bill and frank s end might be the only non depressing end we ll likely ever see in tlou as a whole. the fact that people are upset that bill is gay in the show but we re totally fine with him being gay in the game  really makes me laugh .but hey  that s just me. good episode  as usual!
i disagree  bill in the game was tough  rough and unfiltered  but in the show he was extremely gentle. also  bill is an idiot in the show  but was very capable in the game. he kept calling himself a  survivalist  but stood in the middle of an open area getting shot in the stomach.i am happy  however  that they re finally over the stereotypical whimsical overly-feminine gay character and write gay men as actual men now. i would ve liked this episode more if i had any reason to care for bill  but he s dead  so there s no reason to care. it really was pointless filler episode  and dare i say  boring
bill in the game is way better.his interactions with ellie are hilarious. this show is a total l
that s what bill said.
ignoring all this woke stuff i think it s the best bet  use your time to watch old good movies or series
episode 3 was a good love story. to feel like the director had to trick us seems unnecessary  but i get it. it was a cool ep. and it wasn t that much of a filler that bill in the game was implied to be gay but i do wish he would have survived.
thank you for letting me know . i was going to watch. now i will pass.
there is no legitimate reason to denounce true love  period  end of sentence. honestly  coming from another era i d prefer not seeing men kissing either but that s totally my problem. at least i m self aware enough to see that.
it was boring as f    absolutely not what i expected out of a show about fungus zombies. its not the bromance i object to its being bored. this was around 45 minutes long. video games are on the whole fast paced and exciting. i dont mind them sprinkling stuff through the show like for example  game of thrones but this is something that s definitely not for me. everyone moans about milla s resi movies   and i totally get what game fans  were upset with them   but they obviously did something right to get through 6 of them. personally i think it s knowing there audience. obviously it s not made for me but a heads up would have been nice.
they didn t get me! i never watched any tlou!
i had somewhat enjoyed the show up to this episode. i m not a big last of us fan. the first game was ok. i have zero interest in playing the 2nd. this episode was completely pointless filler which added nothing to the show other than  this is how they got a truck . it wasn t terrible but i m not going to rush back to watching a show that so arrogantly wastes my time and then boasts about how they  tricked  me into watching it.  fool me once  shame on you...  i m not gonna take the chance of being fooled again   _   _
i m happy i m not watching this show all because  of this. we don t need tricked into this  the reason men like me are tired of it is because we don t want to have to know or see some dude even putting into another dude. it s just gross.
it s really not that big of a deal  it s just a well written love story that happens to have two men at the center of it. nobody can trick you into watching something  you have the ability to shut it off whenever you want. the fact that you and geeks and gamers get so triggered over it  just makes you guys look bad.
this is way the inclusion of gay characters gets so much backlash! why trick people into something  when you can just simply show a gay character s story  it s not like being gay or lgbt is such a taboo thing or a taboo story in this day and age... so why make it seem like something dirty and something you have to  spring  on people  bill s sexuality was hinted in the game and it wasn t made a big deal... so why make it a big deal for the show
i wasn t going to watch this anyway  as i never played the game  but now i m definitely not!!!
i support you for so many years however you are saying so many stupid things in this video. episode 3 was amazing  one of the best cinematic works in tv history. please don t use christianity as an argument  i m a christian too and i support lgbt rights  christianity is about love not about judging other people.
that s sad because i hear it was good  but it s not even surprising
being tricked into watching 2 gay dudes get intimate has really made me realize just how disgusted i am at the thought of man-on-man sex.not caring about 2 dudes smashing is easy when you don t watch gay porn or media.  you do you  i have no opinion on it  so long as you re not doing kids or graping but this  my face twisted in disgust at the sight of ron swanson getting down with this dude.i think this just made me ... less tolerant   i truly do believe straight men have a biological disgust trigger at the thought of man-on-man sex.
lol  that s one of the reasons i haven t bothered watching any tv shows in quite some time  since most are basically lgbt propaganda.
thank-you.i was super uncomfortable during those borderline gay cinemax moments rofl . still enjoyed the episode.  but hella uncomfortable. p.s. no prude  i get more ass than a toilet seat rofl
many masking their homophobia with  why can t it stick to the game   while others just straight up not wanting lgbtq representation in mainstream media. i have two thoughts about this. who on earth wants a shot for shot remake  if i wanted that i d just play through the game again. i want an adaptation. i want tv film to play to their strengths and give me an alternative take  delve into the human condition. if tlou is a little too diverse   progressive for you  i think you may need to stop watching. it s been their story since 2014. there are countless stories which avoid representation altogether. i dunno what to tell you. watch them instead.
i just started forwarding after he came out the shower
melonie   all gay characters in tv shows are feminized netflix s dahmer  am i a joke to you
i kind of liked it  because it were between 40-50 minutes without bella ramsey
to who  twitter
@user-ld2vu2qi8p  to anyone who watches their youtube channels
@peterlucci2242  and
@user-ld2vu2qi8p  why do you keep asking questions  what is so confusing
@peterlucci2242  that it matters if nobody s think they look bad.
@user-ld2vu2qi8p  huh  go away
@peterlucci2242  done  boring conversation anyway.
lol well that s based on a true story
and in the meantime  what !  what melonie !  i m dying here to know!!! p  p  p
7 10 the word for that is effeminate.
joke s on him. i knew they would do this  so i didn t watch any of  the last of us.
yup quit after the first episode too
wait! there was little to no sex scenes in game of thrones.
quote admiral ackbar   it s a trap!
it broke new ground
i wouldn t have watched it. i almost skipped the whole episode
i m gay and even i think it was a bit on the silly and forced side. i haven t seen the show yet as i am going to play the game eventually
i will definitely be skipping that fruitboy episode
they don t act like feminine men. idk that laugh bill made when they were eating grapes was pretty gay.
they ruined a chance to have the best action scene in hbo history so they could show a mediocre bromance   they could have introduced the bloaters and actually had the infected involved in the show .
did people forget bill s sexuality in the game dude was in a relationship with frank but frank got bit and ran away and hung himself didn t see episode 3 yet but can force shit like that in the show
hahahaha! it was horrible to watch even though i have nothing against guys doing girl stuff but i would like to have a choice what i can see
neil drukman cuks again.i mean strikes again yeah strikes again that s what i meant.
gosh darn you look so cute in that sweater!!
if this shit was so  normal  then why did they have to sneak it in
i knew it... why give the benefit of the doubt to this  if they often change a work without lgtvhd  stuff on it by inserting that  of course they ll amplify one that already has lgtvhd  on it...
the last of us. has been renewed for a season 2 by hbo. melonie goes bust on this topic just like you we re wrong with in namor in wakanda forever.
thank god i didn t watch this. i knew something was gonna happen to this show
this is a joke  right
i know right!
9 50  expertly handled  i didn t realize there was an expert way of being gay lol sounds like indoctrination to me  which i believe is what they re using the show for. it sucks they re doing this to good stories instead of just being original and coming up with their own. but hey  controversy views.
good take.
i dated a girl and at the time she hadn t seen got and she told me she had interest in it. and i simply asked  well  will you at least fast forward through the sec scenes please   and she laughed and said  probably not . women abuse men just as often. it s just more subtle and more easily justifiable. i can t stand sex scenes. just pan up and fade to black at least.
jokes on them  i didn t even watch it! i know how part 2 turns out so why would i waste time on a show based on the last of us
so far  the walking dead is walking over this thing. it doesn t compare.
not me i heard before hand and will skip episode 3 hahahaha and its why i stream for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
guess what. pound the fast forward button like i did. i don t need to see sex on screen. even gratuitous straight sex interactions make me uncomfortable too.
is anyone else getting tired of hearing  this isn t made for straight men  and then when the show movie fails  straight men are blamed for it
yeah the woked it up way to much i m not watching it i m just watching reviews and easter egg videos from screen crush
i think we all need to stop watching remakes. if there isn t money in it  then it wont get made.
4 54 it s not a viral infection. it s a fungal infection.
it was gay  but it wasn t preachy  and it was well done.  i would guess that the vast majority of the audience was okay with it.
i have no idea what happened in broke back mountain but i wasn t watching a gay movie
the title love you loong time...
it s just a pathetic virtue signal just to impress her
melanie do you know of any good circuses in new england
this is wrong to lie or trick an audience s to watch a show is a quick way to get canceled and bankrupt the show
this is why i don t watch modern shows. i don t care what peoples sexual preferences are  just don t shove your sexual preference down my throat...literally
i didn t watch game of thrones for the same reason. i m catholic and heard it was full of rape and nudity. if a series has to do that  it s not good enough to stand on its own.those who can t do  do porn.
lol for real  the article must have confused it with the coof
@meloniemacgoboom  the media does love talking about it  so i wouldn t be surprised.
once i realized where the episode was headed i noped out. wont be watching any more episodes either. tired of this agenda pushing garbage. i just want a good story and show to wind down from real life stress. i would all together drop netflix if it was not for the few shows my wife wants to watch. these idiots are only tricking themselves if they think this kind of garbage matters to the vast majority. there is no real meaning to bad writing even if it was somehow relevant. great vids and content
there s literally one sex scene  and it s all implied  what gratuitousness are you referring to here  i don t think i even remember seeing nudity  don t you just see them shirtless under the covers and that s it
e x a c t l y
wish i could link my old comment from like 4 months ago when i said this was going to happen.
didn t trick me. haven t seen it. but honestly  what were you expecting from a show where everyone involved is super woke.
i was skipping through this entire episode cause it was insanely boring  and it added nothing what so ever to the show. they gave us a 90 minute episode and spend like 80 minutes of it showing us this romance just to kill them off...like what was the point of it when it seriously added nothing to the actual story. and the crazy thing was so many sites and reviews giving it 10 10 amazing reviews. i ll say nick offerman did a good job acting  but that s about it.
it cut off too soon  she didn t say go boom!!!!  where do we go from here
i m still baffled they put a filler episode in a 9 episode season. this isn t like an obligatory 20 episodes so they have to fill it with something. i was never going to watch it  but i would have been annoyed at having my time wasted whether it were a gay or straight relationship.
the subscription of hbo  cancelled
me and my boyfriend didn t hate the episode but thought it was actually useless exposition with no real payoff. they could ve accomplished more by shortening their brokeback mountain tale down to a series of flashbacks spanning ten minutes and ya know  move the story forward instead of ramming more lgbtqyztsjfof nonsense down our throats. but here we are.
wit until they golf joel out of the picture. lets see how people react to that
you are adorable
glad i didn t try to watch the series.
hey i m dressing up as mario for the mario movie and wanted to know if you wanted to know if you wanted me to tweet or something at you
you would be the same type of person against the interracial kiss back in the 70 s. you can stop watching so you won t feel  tricked  anymore.
hi melonie!
nope i knew where it was going once he invited him in. i stopped watching and wont continue watching
make trick right now is a problem  poor magician they are really bad people or michael jordan always tricking other players.
got into some clashes over this. they expanded the story purely for the characters being gay. that s always their motivation  it s become lazy and cliched at this point.  people have massively overrated this show and especially this episode.
i think i m gonna be sick
haha yup i realized i messed that up lol!
@meloniemacgoboom  sooooo......are you going to say it or what         it s been over 24 hrs
actually no  they are gonna demonize joel at the end of 1st season so they can comfortably kill him at the beginning of season 2
hi  _
ellie took a gay porn magazine from bill s place in the original game so i knew he was gay. no surprise. i m straight and seeing men kiss really doesn t bother me at all. director didn t fool anyone. we all knew bill was gay.
lol i stop at ep2
they put numerous warnings on films and series lately  especially disney  so lets have an lbgqt warning   then we have a complete set of warnings lol.
go boom
when i found out the episode was just a gay romance  i didn t watch
yes i ve stopped watching after episode 1 cause of neill cukman implications in this joke of an adaptation
oh like they tricked the last of us players into watching a movie instead of playing a game
tricked audiences into turning thier trash fire off mid episode. im so tired of everything being soft core pron  its just gross and amazingly low effortits interesting that story can make up for lower production value  but the inverse is not nearly as effective
hahaha. i knew they would do bait and swtich. its 2023 so hollywood is going to keep doing this to the audience. did people not learn from vlema and the other hundreds of other   adaptations
love you
didn t watch the first episode not going to watch the other episodes.
knowing what this tv show and directors are trying to do and resorting to tricks i am glad that i never watched this woke crap and never will!
should that have been like in the warning at the begining of the episode  like.....rated for mature viewers for violence  homosexual relations  gore etc.
mel please tell me where you got that l hoodie
woo jesus  3
awww.... looks like i didn t fall for the trick.  gfyo  hollywood.
dear prudence
flint in black sails is the best gay character ever.
it s odd they had to trick audiences as gay relationships have been portrayed as normal years ago in shows like six feet under or the wire. and they didn t need to trick anyone as it s normal right
my my my what a surprise.......
exactly hape of cutscenes and boring gameplay never got the hype all the characters that die you know for about 2 minutes yet people are so attached i don t get it
crunchyroll shop
@meloniemacgoboom  thank you  your so nice
ha! not today  neil. i had more than enough with tlou2. your trickery won t work here again.
cool l shirt
melonie should be my gf lol
bro on bro  .... no  it s bro in bro.
that s not bill and frank. that s the sneak.you missed the buss. from brokeback forward there were plenty of gay men who were men.
did he tried to trick audience into watching gay scene in a way trans people sometimes try to trick straight dudes into sex or.....
anything hollywood produces nowadays or ip they try to convert is shit never forget this
that episode made me want to puke and i couldn t finish it.  i won t watch anymore of them.
cool l sweatshirt dude
it s only going to get worse
it doesn t matter which type of media i consume. whether it be gaming  reading or movies shows.as soon as i see any sort of lgqbt of any type  i turn it off.good on you for following your heart  but don t go shoving it down people s throats. no thanks.
no!! quit letting whatever you are hearing or seeing let you judge the blind and deaf.men.....
wait  one of the main characters is a lesbian and was implied for a long time and its shown completely on the last of us 2. but now this is bad because is two guys   i dont think is woke when everything was implied from the very beggining.
didn t work i just skipped the episode.
i started the 1st episode of got. i could not finish  never watched anymore. gratuitous sex scenes do not make a show or movie good  its uncomfortable and not necessary.
you are a very beautiful and gorgeous woman ps happy early valentine s day beautiful and gorgeous woman
let s pretend ellie did not have a full on lesbian kiss in the game  too  yeswhere was the outrage then  hypocrites
you cut out the  go boom!  but yeah  i have no interest in watching trash from hollywood nowadays  especially stuff like ep3 of tlou
wont pat for hbo. i watched ever episode so far through the efap recaps lol.
i m so glad i resisted watching this show. the first clue to people this show would end up woke was the race swapping of the characters.
got free prevciew of hbo this week i watched 10 minutes of last of us it seemed like alot of the woke shit dry and boring
last of us   wtf is that
okay i m just going to be real if you re so angry that you ended up watching a gay love story episode of a tv show that you go out of your way to write a bad review of it you re more than likely have some personal issues you need to sort out either about your sexuality or about something else like don t get me wrong i understand that some people just aren t really comfortable seeing any type of sex act in their media maybe they are watching the show based off the video game they liked with their family and maybe that s a little awkward that s perfectly legit and understandable but if you re only angry that an episode focused on gay characters because they re gay you re just insecure and kind of a weirdo
you shall not lie with a male as with a woman  it is an abomination. leviticus 18 22
there needs to be a warning at the start of the show. content contains gay sexually imagery   suggestive themes.   especially if its a childrens show. saying you had to trick ppl to watch it means a lot of people the majority didnt want to see it.
i really liked the episode  still do.     but why say you wanted to trick people    tricks are for kids.   smdh.
i knew how the game went  so i expected this series to go that way. the game never had any interest for me  and neither does this series.
no creator should have to trick their audience. it shows a lack of creativity.
i was never tricked. i didn t even like the first game.
-gays exit-ppl don t give a dame-gays try to make everything about them-ppl hate gays-surprised pikachu face.jpg

nothing new  the last of us has a history  call it a  reputation  if you will  of tricking people
in terms of videogame adaptations of 2023  the super mario bros movie will be a financial hit that is entertaining and not woke. the last of us on the other hand  is the exact opposite. just wait and see. i personally cannot stand it when they insert an in your face moment like that in a show about mushroom zombies. it s really awful.
egyptians we re the first to step foot in our country adventure apparently isn t your game.
well considering part 2 is gonna have that whole trans struggle snuggle bit i think we know where it s going. oh and spoiler joel dies in the end -_-
yeah everybody recommend something by checking everything you know what i mean because it s christian channel goddammit.
hahaha no he didn t. haven t watched it and won t watch it and i probably won t watch last of us now either
i skipped it all not something i wanna watch
i mean  why follow the story through one of the best parts of the game when you can just throw some gay stuff up there instead
damn him
i ll pass on watching thatstuff
i didn t really mind it it was in good taste ppl are gay there gonna be gay atleast they know they were men when you re saying i have to accept you as a woman then i draw the line
the first episode was sub standard  the second was meh  the third was a total waste of time. people are craving for something new but this is just disgusting
so to sum it up play the game skip the show
we knew this is what druckmann was going to do with this show. completely bastardize it for virtue points.they destroyed bill s place   impact in the story in order to have a softcore gay romance.the show just sucks. pun intended.
don t know why people keep falling for this. they re are not going to stay true to the story. they need established characters to push their own agenda  because they don t know how to develop characters on their own.
not following the source material when they boasted  that they will like no other show adaptation ever did  true to the source trust us... right...that was a snooze feast   no fridge trap   no line between ellie and bill   bill dies !!! wtf !! no . just no   ..episode 4 its the last chance i give this show.
not surprising at all
they don t create anything new
that  lewd  scene was disgustingi skipped 10 minutes straight forward
almost didn t  watch bc i knew beforehand. not my thing. however  i gotta say i teared up  was invested  and thought the episode was great. but ya pushing their sexuality and assisted suicide is prob crap id be better off not watching.
it was a dishonest move and if they have to resort to such underhanded tactics then it only underscores that the message is rotten to the core.
yeah  they lost a viewer from me. it was all an agenda based episode.. had nothing to do with the movement of the story... they tricked people into not watching anymore good job..
...false advertising...bait and switch...
look at all these simps tryna rizz through a electronic and the nerds think they have a chance lol
they just refuse to do anything normal with a caucasian male actor. they have to be either weird or evil in order to fit their agenda. i wanted bill the survivalist in his element killing zombies alongside joel and ellie and not.....brokeback mountain  ew.
heeeeeyyyyy!
a bit excessive and a bit old fashioned in the way you say things in this video but still its you it s your opinion.personally i liked this episode it was by far away for what i had in my mind but still cute
this comment doesnt meet our terms of service.
him having to trick people to see that stuff just shows  how menhating the society is. they don t even want to see men in love. i totally understand  why he had to do that. i am so angry now! again!
no boom orz
i ve not and will never see this show.    another reason why i stopped watching abc cw and other networks.   got tired of this sort of thing going on.
that kind of stuff is being shoved - no pun intended - everywhere. it was bad enough the romance and straight sex stuff was being plugged into just about everything  but now it s getting outta hand with the same sex stuff.
do you know the moment he bent down to kiss him the show for me was over this stuff with the gays and lesbians being shoved down our face is getting ridiculous at least give us a warning on the rating that they might be gay or lesbian contact in it before we straight people have to watch that
call me a hater but i instantly turned that shit off when that scene popped up... idc but i m against that shit period.. it s clear to see they want to force this whole agenda upon us. i stopped watching after that scene. turned it off
game of thrones ruined a lot of stuff for me.
cry
skipped the episode it was disgusting great show aside
ya know...i ve been giving this show a chance but i m really not enjoying it so far. they keep changing the outcome of all my favorite scenes from the game. also  i m not buying pedro as joel one bit...
yeah... now im definitely not goin to watch last of us. i don t like gay s   t. but the bit where you mentioned how gays are portrayed as rather feminine reminded me of something opposite  willem defoe in boondock saints... character he played acted so confidend and manly that suddenly finding him in bed with another guy was a real suprise. also  a good example of a movie where whole   gay thing  didnt feel forced into the plot by some virtue signalling libtard
finally  someone said it  last of us is boring. on top of some obvious changes from the game  personally i stopped watching midway through the second episode. when i played the game  it was mostly for gameplay  and that is it  story was bland and really. the game was just not to my liking. this show may do well  or it may not but it was waste of time when i could just draw some panels.
tricking people just to watch this disgusting   vile filth is just wrong.
i m generally supportive of your content  including this one and your message here  but it s also very annoying every video you keep having to say i m a good christian this and prudish that. im not calling you prudish and am definitely not saying anything bad to you for being christian or anything like that  it s refreshing   but you saying this just makes it very cringe  just chill on always identifying yourself as part of a group. you don t need that. content speaks for itself perhaps.
you can tell it s 2023 because a devout christian has to make the disclaimer  i don t care who s doin   em .it may be true... but if you really don t care...
as a guy and a massive fan of tr. i would be so annoyed if there was a gay scene with lara and another female tomb raider. that s not who lara croft is  tr isnt even a romance story. why have that in there.these writers are catering to the wrong audience.
didn t trick me i haven t watched that garbage at all
i m gay and this 3rd episode was boring as hell. they ruined bill and frank.
ha it didn t trick me because i never watched it. i spotted garbage from the moment it came out  especially after your review of it melonie.
if you have to  trick  an audience into going along with your ideology  then you know your content is poor at best.
did you miss the part where i said i didn t watch house of the dragon for this same reason when they had a straight scene  lol
well  now i know another show that i won t be watching. at this point i might as well cancel my hbo subscription. it s all just woke crap at this point.
i totally stopped watching and won t be going back.
it s just shows how hungry people nowadays for decent entertainment that they are willing to put themselves through the last of us and still call this mediocrity of a tv show  good  afterwads. woke hollywood really lowered the standards!
oh eek its graphical rumpy pumpy how sweet. we all knew this was coming. small mercy they didnt make them sassy black trannies with a lisp. if this was gentleman and respectable lady people would be outraged.was it  romantic  persay. this is prison romance. not a frickin  love  story everyone seems to be fizzing at the bungholes over. this is grim apocalypse creepery  this dude has a private secure compound and basically rents a toyboy gigolo  romance  slave for security and resources. they both understood this. and  secretly  hated eachother. oh lets just insert some tender moments playing twister holding hands and piano music but did they put on some kenny g and light the candles
i enjoy your channel but this is reaching. this was a well done story and it was well executed. this shows me that you are in it for the click bait and rage. i m disappointed.
its a disgusting show!
so glad i don t subscribe to hbo max for a lot of reasons.
when i was watching it  after the first 15 mins i was like wtf. i gave a chance for little longer and then it got really gay so i fast forward to basically to the end. it was literally 40 mins of gay dudes  not homophobic but not going to watch it.
prude
stupid move  but ultimately i really like the show.
all those guns to choose from at those gay dudes house and he sticks with a bolt action rifle....good grief.it was totally a filler episode...and it looks like they didn t even stock up on good guns and ammo.  the only good thing about the episode is they finally portrayed a survivalist without making them out to be a crazy bigot and sticking in some kind of maga reference.
there s a reason i don t start watching any new shows right away.  with the industry the way it is  i expect this crap. i am not interested in in gay romance movies. at all. putting any romance front and center into this story ruins it  imo. maybe if the girl develops a crush on a boy her age  then he turns into a mutant  it would fit. at this point  i am just fed up with all of the rewriting of perfectly good stories to cram racism and homosexuality down everyone s throats.
they didn t trick me. i know better than to watch anything made in the last 10 -12 years until all the reviews are in. my tolerance for wokie preaching is very low.
i really don t watch anything anymore. shit has bececome boring cheesy.  when i do watch something it was usually made before 2016.  maybe that child people could protest shit. everybody go out and buy the last of us. make it so that it s outselling new games.
too bad. i did like the first 2 eps. but i m assuming this is just the first of agenda-driven episodes in an effort to alienate certain viewers. it worked. i m out.
druckman has proven himself to be a liar and a fraud. i question how much of the first game he actually wrote  cause last of us 2 was bad
that episode was dog crap. it was so terrible  and literally nothing happened !
it s the last of us. how did people not know there would be plenty of lgbt crap in it
the last of us was a trash game anyways. clickers and juggernauts.. how original when it came out  how mind-blowing.. what a story.. what an epic.. just kidding it was absolute trash  like too many games nowadays riding that trend wave.
aaron from the walking dead was a good character that happened to be gay. as for the last of us series i refused to watch it after what they done with the last of us 2 game.
i couldn t watch game of thrones either. pretty much had rape scenes. gross. forget it.
oh  thank god the gays survived the zombie apocalypse. you know  i did always wonder.
this show is so inferior to the game it is truly a puzzle why it exists. tlou 2 buried the franchise and this show is just desecrating the grave. if you ever want to replay the original game stay far  far away from this travesty.
the show feels cheap to me. like theres great prosthetics and cgi  yet a lot of scenes still look and feel like they are filed in a small set or in some randos back yard. the episode i think was good  but why cant it be a man and a woman  or a man and his child where the child gets sick or heck even a man and his dog getting old and dying. how many people in the last of us audience identify with homosexuality  if its anything like the real population of homo to hetero its less than 2  of your audience. which is a weird minority to pander to.
i didn t watch
biologically speaking sodomy is damaging and has no logical purpose  since the only purpose of sex is reproduction. and behavior without logic is called madness.
he was joking about tricking people mel. cmon use your head.
is this show about gaypocalypse  or what
gratuity is used to cover up weak storytelling. why i always thought game of thrones was a pathetic show too
i wasn t going to watch the last of us before i watched this video  i certainly don t want to watch it now. i m just not into lgbtq  centered love interests in media.
comparing to pixar s up is utterly ridiculous. a visual animated masterpiece to a crappy episode to a show based on a video game  get outta here.
15 seconds in  which is why i would never watch it.  did everyone forget what the game series did   useless woke trash. why would anyone expect different from a tv show of the same name and premise
this is totally absurd. next stage  a gay history between a  clicker  and a  bloater . ridiculous  nobody cares
ha ha i did not get tricked    last of us 2 was a woke disaster and bomb     never played the game   will never watch it on hbo max
i fast forwarded through a lot of this one. this one was boring.
i just stopped watching  turned on some old south park episodes instead.  watching gay men makes me nauseous  can t help it.
first
death note boring
you people just want to complain about anything for the grift
and next they ll have a dude  pretending to be a girl  getting railed from behind by another dude. just like in the second game. disgusting
i hated episode 3. literally had to skip  such a waste of an episode
refuse to watch. they took a well loved game and rurned it into propaganda with the second. it was obvious the show would follow suite. will not give them a dime
gross
this gay episode killed the show
going to skip this series now. hate these ham fisted inserts of political messages. luckily i always binge so hadn t started it
unsubbed.
ah yes. another hating video purely made for likes  views   incels.
facts
oh noes!  another attempt at shaming people who don t want to watch degeneracy by calling them mean names.. whatever shall we do !also  thanks for commenting.  be sure to leave a like.
you gave this a view because you couldn t resist spreading hate too. is your hate better just because you think your opinion is right
