frosk saying she s leaving the gaming industry is kind of like a person saying the relationship is over 10 years after they were actually dumped. gamers left frosk a long time ago.
nobody stood up for me well if one of my coworkers opened their mouth constantly  expedited the collapse of my company  and bragged online about not getting laid off while my peers did - i would gladly leave them to burn in whatever fire they created
first adam leaving and now frosk  glad to see the trash taking itself out
frosk  i m quitting the gaming industry for good!everyone  wow... what a waste... the poor children...
frosk-  no one had my back  the rest of us- i miss the part where that s my problem.
kinda silly how she cries that no one had her back...but then you remember when she said  i survived  in the face of hundreds of her peers being laid off. yeah...she did it to herself.also  it s funny how video game jobs work out when you hire someone for their experience.
i hope frosk gets the help she needs and wakes up just being quite honest
her gaslighting is unreal.frosk  haha! i survived the job cuts! nyeh! nyeh!also frosk  i m leaving because no one stood up for me! wahhh!
i think gamers as a whole messed up when we stopped gatekeeping our hobby. i have been telling people for years this same exact thing!
mel bringing the realness once again. proper level headed woman  the world needs more like her
my dad roasted me my whole life growing up  nothing like a cod lobby of course  but it kept life fun and made me able to stand up for myself with just my words. i imagine when i get to heaven he s got  an epic roast waiting on me and we can both laugh at each other again.
to paraphrase frosk if you don t like the gaming industry  don t work in it. peace.
i wish her all the best at her new job at the dmv.
frosk   i m leaving! literally everyone   good.
games for me is a way to escape reality and spend some time having fun and just being a badass. i dont care what a character looks like  as long as its allowing me to live another life for a short time. i am very introverted so playing multi-player games takes a lot as it totally takes me out of my comfort zone. first time for me was in outriders and after joining a discord group and chatting with some folks we teamed up and had alot of fun  sure some players where just a holes but 99  of the time it was fun. thats what gaming should be  fun.
you know that meme of the soccer fans cheering at the bar. that s what a majority of gamers feel like today.
we need more girls like you melonieat least you are logical
none of my friends stood up for me. well  that s because you don t have any friends froskside note  gatekeeping is important  because it stops the barbarian hordes from breaking into the castle.
frosk is an agent of chaos.  her main point was to cause a ruckus then skedaddladdle.  i hope frosk gets proper help.
forks  disappointment  tweet is her just admitting that she s upset that people wouldn t bend the knee to her narcissistic demands.
@colinmorgan2737  i don t think the woods deserve to have to deal with her either though.
lol
you beat me to it..this is one of those  im gonna quit before i get fired  scenariostrying to make a grandstanding exit in hopes to be a martyr in articles feminist bullied out of a career by man babies offended by her stunning and brave rants
yeah. i guess she just assumes that she is right in what she said and the way she went about it  even with all the backlash.
who did she ever stand up for  she celebrated when her coworkers were fired.
the entire g4 crew stood up for her and it tanked the show. she single-handedly killed its revival.
@minstrelblood9110  she only cares about herself and controlling other people.
they did stand up for her and they just damaged they re reputation and credibility drastically for doing so  i call it karma.
i couldn t agree more!
she suffered in that toxic environment for years.
but don t you understand  you owe her! we all owe frosk. she is entitled to our respect  love and financial support no matter how she behaves! she should not have to take the consequences of her actions like the peasants would have to.
@alexubel  it was failing and doing bad before she did this. but she still made it so much worse.
not to mention doing all of that for some imaginary fabricated systematic oppression in the workplace that doesn t actually exist.
fire comment.
yeah i agree
i always found that guy as pretentious.
lol doe
@drakashrakenburgproduction5369  he was one of my favorites back in the old g4 days  finding out how he really is  is very heart breaking.
@brad2737  agreed
i grew up watching adam and he s as good at his job as it can possibly get  but he does slide leftist jabs in there. that s hard to respect...it s really sad cuz i was just a little kid the first time i watched x-play. idk what is going on with people lately. frosk is also good at her job but her preaching is abysmal. it s far worse than what adam was doing. far far worse. the gaming industry is becoming shitty  and jessica chobot actually predicted it. she predicted gaming companies starting to spend all their money on expensive voice actors and marketing and neglecting to make an actually good game. she predicted big companies taking over and the art suffering as a result. she predicted them buying ips from small developers  and ruining games as a result. that is what s happening. i first heard warnings of that about 10 years a go from g4  but i think it tarnished their opinions of capitalism. they forget that capitalism has lead to the technological advancements that has given us video games in the first place. the top countries producing video games are capitalist. america  england  japan just to name a few. it s all a mess. this trend of ideological anarchy is sour as fuck and i don t like it. just because the industry is flawed that doesn t mean we have to start preaching social justice horseshit. this anti-white man agenda is horrible. i m a white man and this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth. politics based on  racial struggle  is literally nazism. they re becoming nazis.
totally agree
or  oh no!.....anyways
this reminds me of the golf scene in i love you man. stop.i m sorry.please don t go.......
i read that in carl s voice
just like the last replier  i read this in carl s voice  haha.  good reference here.
fr
and why the hell did she expect anyone to have her back when they know she alone is responsible for putting them out of business  it s mind boggling...  hey i m going to ruin all of you! boo hoo... no one supported me
apparently that was an inside joke but still the timing was awful self awareness was bad
@boomingbob1579  an inside joke for who  herself
and it s everything about gaming... not just journalism  but actually making the games.it s like nobody learned from mass effect  andromeda... their artists didn t even know the pre high school techniques of drawing eyes...like  you re 12 - in your first actual art class ever... day 1 of drawing faces  aka the eyes - they failed.but they did put effort into nerfing the character creator  to make it mathematically impossible to make an attractive woman -  in order to empower average women keep in mind that they took that action  while literally not knowing how to draw eyes...  . they also took a nerf hammer to the face of the model they hired for female ryder shepard read  they hired the most-beautiful person they could find  seriously  that woman could stop traffic in heaven   - and then  literally  disfigured her face.  to empower average woman ...as opposed... to actually hiring... an average woman...they did not disfigure the male ryder... he looks just fine.so  when each of those models go for another job  this is what the answer to their latest major job looks like male ryder   oh yeah  i was the male protagonist in the latest mass effect game from ea - check it out! female ryder   oh. um... i ve been in dubai    check out my abs  bro! remember how the pay gap is men s fault  riiiiiight.and they - proudly - spent months trying to figure out how to make a female voice actress  voice sound like a male ai... specifically so that people wouldn t  be forced to hire men for ai voices seriously...because they d never heard of cortana  siri  alexa... ... ... ...tldr me a was never finished and the entire building opened to make the thing was sold  before finishing the game.because they hired people like frosk.  progress
@galadriusthemighty  the staff apparently that s what clownfish said but it s bad regardless
@iro6758  yeah
@iro6758  pepperidge farms remembers
wake up from being woke  that will be the day. lol
that would be best. good on you for taking the high road.  with pizza in your name  you have to be a good person.
@bolski6125  never will happen.
she won t admit her wrongdoings and thus will never improve
na she woke herself to sleep
there is only one solution for a heavy wounded horse.
she ll figure it out when she stops getting phone calls  and her handlers drop her because she s costly to work with.you can only fuck up million dollar properties for so long before you get a reputation...
lol not going to happen.
if it s possible
i hope she gets what she deserves.
@user-tq5yo7sp6q  exactly.
@adj789  truth
@bolski6125  i mean it does actually happen from time to time.
or she can figure out no matter what field of work ur in  9 10 everyone is out for themselves it s not just the gaming industry she is in for a rude awaking unless going for well no wait every job that is not a management position or short of being a entrepreneur  jobs suck from service industry  sales  entertainment  it s all about getting ahead  facts don t care about feelings
i kinda liked her in the beginning  i ll stand up for an underdog every day  until she ruined it for herself in about the worst way ever.
@bolski6125  lol that would be a day
@noneyabidness9644      thanks my dude i try everyday lol
@bolski6125  such a day is impossible
@wallace1723  what kind of gatorade is good to do that with  getting kinda specific  ain t cha
@manofaction1807  lemon lime is the only drinkable gatorade  so any other flavor is acceptable.
problem is most of the therapist today are so woke that they will tell her she is correct in everything she does.

i couldn t agree more with this.
agreed. rational thinking people like mel are in very short supply in the gaming industry and pop culture.
the ones who virtue signal the loudest have the most to hide  - bringing the fire on this one
@chrisswanson5775  and society in general
definitely
fax
never thought of it that way.  yeah  now that i m thinking of it  i wouldn t mind hearing such a roast from my own dad.
frosk is leaving ......who
in the words of gollum  you don t have any friends  nobody likes you
serious help is more sufficient
sufficient help is more proper.
like locked in padded room help
@strikeslifer  oh yeah
@strikeslifer  hey sandrock  this is my new channel. yeah  my old channel including my samsung galaxy j3 orbit went rigor mortis on me.so i m using my mother s phone. it s only temporary
i haven t heard the word skedaddle since my grandpa was alive  thanks for the flashback.
mel . you can t ever leave. your voice is an important one in gaming and gaming commentary. we adore you!
in the end  strength in what you believe in prevails. you inspire a lot of people to stick to what you believe in. thank you for inspiring me too.
frosk quits the gaming industry  and nothing of value was lost!
the audacity of saying something like   you let me down   seriously given her history should qualify as a biblical miracle that she wasn t immediately struck by lightning for it.
they can never just quit quietly  can they
what you said about those who yell the loudest are likely guilty of their objection is true across the board  sexism  racism  homophobia  politics  all of it.
i am glad you were able to make it through and keep posting  videos. it is nice to watch you. may god bless you and keep you safe and well.
lol good riddance...thnx for the great content as always melonie!
you got my full support from a gamer for 35  years. frosk is insane.
you ll know when vic 2.0 becomes a billionaire  because people like melonie mac  eric july  and ryan kinel will become millionaires.
it s very refreshing to see someone as young as you  to have a head on their shoulders!! thanks for the videos  keep em coming!
you know this must hit home for melanie baby mac since she was a beast in that realm. they got rid of mac to bring in demonic frosk subhumans to attack our minds and gaming universe.
frosk   just one last bit of attention.
i miss the sheer brutality of early gaming lobbies  pure comedy
frosk  i m quitting the gaming industry!gamers  we didn t want you anyway  serpent.thank god for sensible people like you  mel.
i don t even have a twitter account but i think it would have been hilarious if someone had replied to frosk s tweet with  no one is going to miss you.
well  i guess we re starting to see the change that we need. i honestly didn t know anything about her until the internet was talking about frosk. but either way  i think what a lot of us need is less internet time and more time in real life.
she can t quit if she was never in.
it s so upsetting to me because i remember the beginning of rainbow six  siege being a team-based shooter with tactical characters and theme. now it has things that i didn t even ask for
frosk the gaming industry is not the same without you  i miss you so much
momma needs her fix
this is great news. now if the rest of the problem people would quit  the gaming and movie show business will be clean again. your videos are awesome sauce btw  keep it up!
the most i ever watched the new g4 network was when they played the  offline  screen after they went off the air. i really enjoyed that show and got a few good laughs from it.
i agree. i ve met some really cool people on online games. great video melonie. that s a cool moon neclace. have fun today melonie
i remember ever since frosk started casting for league she always struck me as the most knowledgable female casters riot had ever hired to date but at the same time she felt obnoxiously insufferable.
you have some great points about frosk. i truly believe she was never very in tuned with the gaming industry. in fact in her reviews she had a lot of terrible takes on games that were genuinely good.is like everyone else thought something over a game in x-play and frosk had to think the opposite. lol
the honesty in your posting here is a refreshing addition to my day. it s always great to hear the truth unvarnished from time to time.thanks!
as much i hope this is true  i think you need to take things like this with a grain of salt. because people like frosk we ll say and do things for the attention.
the only thing missing from frosk s rant was an 18 inch stonehenge monument slowly descending to the floor in the background.
i d play video games with you  i d jump out of a window if i spent 30 seconds with frosk.
the gaming industry quit her.
those who preach the loudest  have the most to hide - jeremy of geeks and gamersyou paraphrased it but it s true
you are definitely a better person than frosk. she wouldn t be wishing anyone good luck in their future endevours.
you know what they say   if they re dumb  give them a shovel and tell them to dig their own grave.
great video beautiful melonie!!! frosk just wants the attention and still won t take the blame.
peace frosk... good luck on whatever you decide to do next...
it s true. i remember learning about  shipping    rp  and  lewding  during the days of myspace and didn t know wtf or why it was such a big deal. the same weirdos into all of that are unsurprisingly the loudest activists. the cancer for all industries.
frosk   gamers are problematic reeee! gets all of her coworkers firedfrosk   why can t we be friends! !
she hemorrhaged g4 with her rant. she was right to rant about toxicity but she shot everyone.  this was a missed opportunity to address the social awkwardness and anger in gamers. no...she wanted to talk about herself.
frosk simply didn t want to burn alone  the  misery loves company  kind of situation. she brought it on herself.
yelling   i quit  as she was bouncing out the door.
i always wondered what the go boom part of your name was about.  for me  i liked it because it reminded me of one of my favourite old time movies  5th element  where one of the main characters would say  big badda boom .
she will be dearly missed
frosk doing all that reminded me of a video with protesters where this one guy joins in and goes  let s flip this car!  then the other protesters stopped and basically told him to leave.
there s a bunch of us  organic  humans that had to move and or get a different job based on certain mandates or situations  but that doesn t mean we are coming back more successful than ever!
normal people get into the gaming scene and find their lane they care about. narcissists like frosk show up and expect to be accommodated at every level  pun intended that has to fail. no one shows up in the metal scene for instance and blasts everyone for not using enough harps and cowbells.in gaming that sort of thing happens all the time now. it s crazy.
man  this is fascinating hearing you talk about the world of warcraft job with the earpieces etc. i am bad at wow  mobas and rpgs and would never want to be hired to pretend to talk about them  but i am happy for those streamers who are. but i can talk about street fighter  killer instinct  ninja turtles and other games all day. mac attack we all got your back
love ya  mel.don t stop being you.i m still unvaccinated and proud.peace.
frosk   you can t fire me  i quit!!
we need a g5 with you being the host please i would watch every day!
she did a pretty good job in that last terminator movie.
and all of a sudden i heard a noise  as if a thousand gamers sighed in relief
i should be saying something along the lines of  understanding and compassion are the correct course  despite her past actions  we are called to forgive. instead i am thinking   good  and nothing of value was lost. i hope people will not think less of me for being entirely too human in my failings.
if i owned a company id sponser you 100 percent because your real and you speak the truth. i dont like liars and fake people.
hi melonie for always bringing these topics that mostwon t cover as much nearly asyou always bring takecare melonie
there is nothing worse than people that are fake  playing a part and not showing their true self!
frosk is the best example of how to be a failure in life.
i don t know if this occurs and can t prove it  but if people lost their jobs because of frosk leading the company astray   i feel bad for any  innocent victims  in the wake in situations like this where you might have a good employees lose something good because of a rogue mouthpiece.
the producers and director where the ones that made the set up in the chat room for  g4  moments before their rants on air.
keep up the awesome work!
did she stand up for her coworkers getting fired by the dozen  nope she made a post and a meme mocking them saying she survived !
lol that s an insult to the androgynous robot
@_..d  that s not an androgynous robot
she could never recover from the frosk rap
i m going back after i move   to a business that generally frowns upon woke    virtue signaling  and also a good chunk of it s customer base.   unfortunately a good friend of mine has been virtue signaling on bs topics and it s getting off putting to hear that crap and later his justifications for it which are bordering on the paranoid. i m about to tell him to seek counseling over this.  so yeah i understand how annoying and insulting that sort of behavior is.
frosk     this industry is really fucked up. me          oh  so you just found out about zoe quinn  huh
it really is a fine line with the gatekeeping  these hobby groups have potential money floating around in them and the principals of capitalism is  service a need ...i have been gaming and comic book collecting for 40 years  and it just breaks my heart to pieces to see my beloved land of escape in the state that it is in.....if frosk wants to leave industry then good luck to her....i hope she lands in a place that makes her happy....
when you mentioned speaking out against the mandates and not getting  it   i subscribed. thank you  sincerely and wholeheartedly.
take me back to when adam   morgan did xplay  back to the era of the frag dolls this era in gaming feels like the worst timeline
lol it s kinda funny. my wife saw the small clip of frosk and ever since then  any time her face is on the thumbnail she always says  ugh  her again  i hate her ... she s not even remotely involved in the gaming space either loledit  she doesn t actually hate anybody... she just exaggerates her dislike because shes dramatic.
she pulled off starting a fire  coaxing it  watching it burn down and took herself with it. no easy feat.
if the majority of people with influence and power are saying the exact same things you are  then nothing you have to say requires bravery of any kind. they are not rebels. they are minions. you  my lady  have risked your career  livelihood  social status  etc etc to speak your mind. that is bravery. i listen you and others while i drive and i appreciate your voice. thank you
she didn t quit she was rejected
holy crap you said lan party. all through college from 2010-2014. shogun 2 totalwar got me through.  as far as smack talk goes i dish it back.  random player in hell let loose   why are you wearing a cape   me   because i m superman beotch!  jumps out foxhole kills two enemies gets shot by tank.
thank you for the great video   that search bar is just a waist of space though right click the task bar and put it hidden.  you can click the start menu and start typing what you want to search for the same results
exactly! the people who aren t real gamers coming in trying to change it is a crazy way to think.
oh poor frosk leaving the gaming industry. she could always try her hand at rap.
was she expecting people to be sad and beg her not to go
who wants to bet that she s riddled with issues in real life  how much a woman can be angry because she s unhappy about her appearance  is always an astounding feat to me.
it s nice to be such a big fan of fromsoftware games and developers like this. they don t pander to the evil western culture. they also don t give in to game journalists who are trash at video games and add a change difficulty setting. which would ruin the game.
imagine someone walking in off the street to your place of business and announcing she s quitting then walking out. that s what this is to me. i had no idea who she was until the g4 blowup and now is quitting. ok  bye i guess.
frosk urinn is that one player that causes the entire party to wipe. then complains that everyone else sucks and that they dont know what they are doing.
so friends should just agree with whatever nonsense she comes up with. i feel sorry for her friends.
yeah but they just left the door open so it wouldn t hit her ass on the way out
speaking sd someone who has been gaming for over 16 years i actually love story in games but i also appreciate a challenge im currently playing the hitman trilogy trying to complete all the challenges
cue the eric andre meme shooting a person representing g4 and frosk saying   why doesn t the gaming industry support me
who would ve thought getting pissed off and yelling at your fan base would backfire.
how does someone become a frosk  i hope she finds a place where she can be happy and get a shower and a warm meal or something.
frisk is like a hard boiled egg fart in an elevator  she s just lingering at this point
ngl  nothing is worse than a woman barging her way into a space and demanding that everyone in that space change the social atmosphere to suit her. especially if that person isn t really interested in that space to begin with. respect to you tho  for understanding that and instead of complaining about it you rolled with it. that s how you do.
frosk just can t stop can she. hey melonie. you look amazing
frosk cancelled herself.period.you should thank her.she did all the heavy lifting...
not using their power and voice to stand up for others...  like when she laughed in the face of people who were let go when she stood in place at g4tv  okay  i guess...
why would a nice young man quit the gaming industry like that    such a shame
i m surprised kotaku hasn t snatched her up yet.
frosk leaving the gaming industry is like a very early christmas gift for 2024. one can only hope anita sarkeesian is next.
woman   i want into the mans world woman enters the mans worldwoman   okay this is unacceptable  thing need to change !
frosks observation of the obvious is inspiring. its is why i stop playing video gams long ago its to toxic environment especially western world games and severs and they are dying as they come on line.
without being hateful  it s very possible many companies she applied at saw how toxic she was and know if they bring her on she will poison the fan base away.
i ve just bought my new itx pc and thought i will start gaming a bit again as i used to be semi-pro but there is literally not many competitive games.
i think it s more a matter of the gaming industry is done with her  and she finally got the memo. thus had to save face in her opinion  by running her suck yet again.  if she s actually gone  that s a good thing.
she will have a bright promising career ahead on onlyfans
it s understandable that she has issues but she can t blame the gaming community and she can t use the gaming community as her emotional punching bag like she was doing...people are not punching bags  eventually they will punch back.
she quit the gaming industry  oh no  how will me move on without her  what a loss! before this video i didn t even know she exists.
yeah like moria

my momma told me its rude to cheer when someone loses. but honestly i m so done with modernity  so screw it  ding dong the witch is gone!
grats on the trivia win.
i ve been angry for a long time see that s the problem
i think frosk needs a shake with those french cries.
frosk finally did something for the gaming industry..... she left
frosty   im leaving   the rest of us   didnt know you were still here
yeah. none of that was going to be avoided. all of hollywood could have stood up with one voice and supported her and the consumer still would have walked away and wanted nothing to do with g4.
goodbye frosk you won t be missed
i hope frosk has a bright new future at starbucks!!
i ve been angry for a long time...   yes  we know.
toxic people need to tear down good people to their level so they dont feel so bad. they will blame anyone but themselves.
i heard a rumor frosk will be on fnt tonight!
hopefully they get affected by the tech cuts happening.
a lot of people stood up for her. they kinda started to go silent after the mob went after them and their show started losing a lot of viewership. the issue wasn t even necessarily what she said. we hear what she said almost on a daily basis. it s when and where she said it. wasn t it supposed to be a review on a game  and it was on g4 which was known as a edgy and fun platform. it was probably going to never work anyway but.... people came to watch and have fun. not get nagged at.
absolutely nothing of value was lost by her  leaving
at some point you get to an age where you speak the same language as people younger than you but have no idea what they are talking about. you just have to assume they re talking about themselves.
frosk will just go   do the same thing at her new job   the same thing will happen until there s no-one left to blame except herself.
i think i need to go to the hospital.i m laughing too hard and my lungs can t take it
this stupidity started with her saying something that wasn t true about a game or something  fans disagreeing with her claim  and her calling them sexists because they disagreed.  she was the one who dragged gender into the argument  even though the fans would have equally disagreed if it had been a male co-host who made the same false-claim.  when someone turns an argument about facts into a gender-matter  it shows how far that person will stretch to claim a victim-status.  the only person that frosk is a victim of is herself.
i wonder if she could be considered a space invader
growing up in the 90 s i remember the two biggest things about art and entertainment. firstly  everyone understood it s about escapism and second directors producers developers lived by the  rule of cool . if art wasn t as awesome  fun and cool as possible nobody would watch it. also  people did not care about identity whatsoever because characters were written with flaws and some kind of heroes journey  self development  that we could all identify with. all this crap about identity politics is made up by narcissistic people that don t care about being entertained and just want to bully people with their ideological delusions.
this is a net positive for gaming. we just got a piece of our land back.
all these fraudulent ignoramuses in the gaming industry need to go i have been gaming my whole life i m 37 now and i still game and i have never seen the gaming industry at a level like this it s ridiculous
frosty urine rants are hilarious
bye froskdon t let the door hit your ass on the way out
i didn t know you studied health and fitness. i did too at purdue. literally dozens of us out here!
frosk  i m leaving the gaming industry! to do  of
the video game industry has a lot of parasites these days.
the gaming industry is a better place now
they were forced to eat sir robin s minstrels  and there was much rejoicing.
i ve been gaming in arcades and early home consoles since being a little kid in the early 80 s and never heard of a frosk  what is a frosk
maybe if she actually tried tackling these perceived  injustices  with love and kindness  there wouldn t be near as much backlash.instead she went on a hate filled campaign   roasting  everyone along the way.girl has a lot of issues she needs to deal with
love to see her go  would hate to watch her leave.
i think it s the other way around. the gaming industry quit frosk.
i notice the industry keeps hiring people who dont know or care about source material
we re talking about a woman who cost others their jobs with her actions. after her rant  it was the average worker at the company that lost their job while she kept hers even though it was she and her rant that hurt the company. this is absolutely no loss for the gaming world whatsoever.
in swtor i would stand at the starting planets giving free cosmetic lightsabers and mounts for new players to enjoy and it wouldn t be just random all the time i would ask them what type of lightsabers you like from the cartel market and they would tell me and i d look to see if i have it or something similiar and i did it simply out of kindness and knew when i started out it was the same way with me.
this is how i feel about the movie industry too  just virtue signaling. especially after weinstein and schneider came to light
forgot frosk even existed. been fighting off stans from the candace owens podcast and from daily wire like it s a damn zombie horde.
they hate gamers because our hobby is an exercise in free will  something they hate.
that s so funny about wow  i grew up playing quake and i did the same thing in wow  never maxed a character but i had a bunch of different arena and bg characters.
hey! new video! have a wonderful friday  melonie.
what happened to me  of course she is the victim. xd
the people who virtue signal the loudest have the most to hide  they should post that everywhere..
what was she expecting when she ranted
companies adopted that their customers were the enemy because of people like frosk. those that have that moto as their company guide for employees to follow are doomed to fail. the gaming industry has gamers as their customer and any person that wants succeed in it has to treat gamers like customers and not rivals.
until i see frosk and mgk in the same room at the same time i m going to say it s the same person.
it s not fair... when it happens to them.
frosk   every gamer is an -ist  a -foob and a bigot. also frosk   i m the victim here for facing consequences for opening my big mouth and that s so unfair. rest of the world   cry me a river.
too bad i didn t know who she was before her g4 rant and even after lol
anita sarkeesian stepped into the gaming elevator  pressed all the buttons  shoved everyone so they fell back  then ripped a hot fart and left the elevator before the doors closed.  she had no positive input for anyone and was so offensive there is simple no way to forgive her.
frosk cant quit the gaming industry  she was never part of it.
don t let the door hit your ass on your way out to the horse you rode in on frosk.
frosk is one angry guy.
when people have a certain ammount of power in gaming industry  like admins  game companies board of directors  or  game developers  some of them will end up abusing that power  either by taking bribe  or by asking intimate contact with  sometimes  minors . but there are some people who will abuse their power in any industry  weather is gaming  movie industry  music  entertainement industry  influencers  or  other types of industry. corruption and abuse happend because the law is not too punishable ! ... the saying     the system is broken ! ...  is  still  true  but  people can raise up  and  change this. the only problem is that corrupt individuals found a way to numm the general population. but  that s just my opinion  and  i might be wrong  -
as a male gamer  i totally see how some male fans  small percentage  could have been toxic to her cause she didn t play the role of olivia munn. but instead of frost going off on a rant that targeted all males  she could have shared one or two toxic comments and clowned the posters in a comedic way. that way it would have shown regular gamers that the toxic comments weren t cool and it would have been funny to see how those toxic posters were paid back but instead she completely trashed the whole community that got the whole ball rolling for the doom of g4..
she didn t lose her job over what she said. she helped tank her company with what she said. her losing her job was a side effect of that.
that frosk rap vid is really funny.
anita even destroyed mirrors edge a new female lead ip because she wanted to change a lot of things.
she was never part of gaming industry  just wanted an audience to listen to her.
poor horse
or she shouldn t have commented on it at all. we are there for a show not for a rant
@darklaw7635  just like olivia munn and morgan webb when dealing with creepy posts and comments. frosk took it way too personal not to mention she had to give away the fact that this new g4 doesn t have a dedicated staff devoted to review games.
melonie  having brothers is your best trait    .  it will serve your point of view for your whole life. my christian ex wife  of 3 daughter family  just could not hang with reality.
i agree with gamers being based  i met plenty of them in ff14.
hahaha! you cant quit something youve been thrown out of!
frosk leaves and g4 closes doors. in other news  sun is bright  clouds are white  sometimes grey and water is wet.
did anyone tell frosk that this is not an airport
pretty ironic that she s denigrating people for doing the very thing that she has done to others.
miss mac dropping the boom again
frosk is now the ceo of clown world. lol
frosk quitseveryone  oh no  anyway..
it has got to be tiring waking up every morning trying to find something to be mad at and playing victim.
your camera settings so good even 480p looks like 1080p 60fps on my outdated phone.
frosk is the smug arrogant type who says things like  i m just living with my ex . her gaming romance is over but she still clings to old cliches.
speaking the truth. games got woke like 5 years ago.
anything related to this individual will now be associated with chrissie mayr s iconic impersonation of her on friday night tights.
people should have just said ok bye felicia and then left it at that don t talk to her lol
good news everyone ! hbo max just gained a new writer   project lead !
i m expecting frosk to start a twitch channel streaming hogwarts legacy for supes
how do you quit an industry that doesn t want to hire you
this is the problem with folks who want to be activists in their field and not stick with their job or passion.she expected an army of activists standing behind her  but quickly discovered that many are not. they re just gamers.
she quit the industry  translation - she couldn t find another grift. bye bye.
squirrel
bahahaha!
bye bye froski bye bye
she doesn t care about the gaming industry  she just cares about her activism. that s it. and it backfired on her. no one is pitying her.
oh noes! frosk left gaming!  that is the end of gaming and fun of any kind.
posted  i survived  but complains how her friends backstabbed her  sounds like it s because she started it first.
frosk has been insufferable for a while. if this means we don t have to hear her anymore  it s all good. hard to believe she thought people support her after she burned g4 to the ground
she won t be missed  i promise that.
i wish her the best of luck in her new career.
i don t think she is really a gamer she came into this genre with the sole purpose to somehow destroy or change it she saw what came before her and the rest is history
translation  no body will hire me and it s not my fault.
idk if it was the way mw2 on ps3 lobbies were in the midwest. i hardly ran into toxic people talking shit. and back then i was always playing those games. with a mic on the whole time. minnesota nice or midwest nice idk
the industry hires thru agenda and beliefs and i can imagine that makes a lot of people pretend they share those beliefs and why they don t  practice what they preach    or they do have those beliefs but have no clue how to do their job lol it s all so fake and spineless
shes. a young lady.    stop picking on her.  stop making her feel guilty.    shes just a human being i m surprised she hasn t slipped on the banana peel. on purpose.  the world needs level headed leaders ...don t be afraid of being outnumbered. eagles fly alone. pigeons flock togetherthe best advice i can give to anyone going through a rough patch is to never be afraid to ask for help frosk!..
frosk actually doesn t believe anything she said. the whole thing was a cope for criticisms for being wrong.
when activists realize they can t control gamers.
frosk  quits gaming industryme  oh no...anyway
feel bad for her future coworkers
people are trying to do the same thing to anime. people who don t understand the media are trying to change it to fit there needs and they don t even watch it.
she would do better as a villain in an 80s movie
is she serious  every single one of her peers made statements supporting her and every single gaming news outlet wrote articles supporting her.
i think it s not unfair ti say 40 to 60  of people in the games industry are just grifters who don t care about games and are just trying to make a name for themselves.
she was never in the game industry.  no one watched her in her esports and no one watched her at g4.   no offense ment on a personal level it s just not the job for her. she entertained no one.   i ve had jobs i was absolutely aweful at.   i recognized it and tried something new.   but i never tried to ruin my coworkers on the way out
i blame all this story but no game garbage on the  game  called gone home.the gaming media was flabbergasted and gave way way to much praise for that monstrosity of media. it all started there for me!
can we really consider journalist  apart of the gaming industry
there are ppl who go above   beyond for good causes  just bcoz you don t see em placed on a pedastol on shitty platforms like twitter doesn t mean that there aren t ppl doing good things in the industry. as for frosk   her fuckery generalized remarks insults to an audience wasn t the way
i know she doesn t like people talking about her appearance because sexism but  from what i ve observed she s not physically unattractive. an attractive woman on any platform can do very well without becoming an of model just by being pleasant to listen to. you can look at research and will find people are literally drawn to attractive people. the fact that people seem to hate her really shows just how abrasive her personality is. idk if she just couldn t handle the trolls or if she actually believes all the nonsense she keeps throwing out there but it s sad to see someone waste such a good business opportunity.
and the gaming industry lost no one of value
you can t be condescending to your viewers about truth. if frosk is bummed that people liked the previous ladies  sexist or not  they had a  have fun personality  that frosk did not have. she was angry she did not get treated like the others   and is using the  beauty  excuse. frosk is pretty and cute. but her personality was so toxic and people did not want to be around that. there will always be mean people.
i think that it is more of a case that frosk realises she is unemployable after burning all her bridges in the industry. flexing on your colleagues who have been laid off weeks before christmas whilst keeping your job when it was pretty much your fault the company went bankrupt isn t a smart move. who would want to take her on or work with her after that
there s is a fundamental difference between a girl gamer and a gamer girl. you all know the difference.
celebrate good good times come on somewhere in the infinite reaches of time  space and parallel universes. where everything is possible not a single version of me is even slightly sad
this is a long time in coming.
the industry goes where the money is  cheaply.  i m thinking of switching to apple because windows ui is favoring touchscreen over mouse and keyboard and microsoft is too cheap to optimize for both.  gaming is the same thing.  they make more money if the game is made accessible.  but my biggest criticism is how hard mode is implemented.  they do it cheaply.  all they do is adjust the numbers.  they are harder to kill and you are easier to kill.  otherwise the content is exactly the same.  hard mode should have extra content thrown at you.
isn t frosk taking the almost exact same stance as adam cesspool
lets hope her new employer is braced for whats coming. their hr will be on overtime.
never watched g4 ever before   if i watched any gaming shows  just watched actual tournaments and then got to see how good not i am lmfao  but was this frosk actually any good at gaming
they put an earpiece in my ear.
she left because she vilified herself before the entire gaming community. saying you quit when everyone already hates you doesn t really count because nobody cares
frosk is mad over the fact that she is a midwit 5
i bet she still doesn t shut up about gamers though.
are you planning on starting a carnivore channel   i need that in my life!  i know  not related to the video but i need to know!
oh no! she quit  anyways  what s for dinner
she said she was planning to. it might be next month. not sure exactly.
chicken  chips  beans  coleslaw and beer much beer
i came upon your channel the other day  it s refreshing to find sane people speaking up with the truth. they have removed competiveness from some games  i d never buy or play games with lgbt  nsfw  feminism  or blm obvious in ur face political stuff.
i m glad she is leaving  hopefully she follows through with it. now if only wu and all the others like them leave too. then we can all go back to enjoying our gaming hobby without their toxicity.
good! she basically yelled at gamers  and admit she never played the games!  she was literally there to virtue signal.
the main red flag is being  angry for a long time.   people frequently become enslaved to perceived slights  and  injustices  and the consequences of their own bitterness and unforgiveness
she must have a  sayings  bible on that desk
frosk never had a place in the gaming industry in the first place. i mean  what did she actually do  afaik all she played was league of legends. so i wish her the very best flipping burgers at mcdonalds as that s all she s good for. just don t dare to spit in my soda. good riddance to bad rubbish.instead they should hire you melanie. at least you know your stuff and are easy on the eyes  that s a compliment btw  not meant to sound creepy or anything .
speaking common sense once again
she complained that her colleagues didn t support her unequivocally  regardless of what she said.  she wanted absolute tribalism  and didn t get it  good .
she just can t stop can she  a true narcissist if there ever was one. does not take any accountability on what happened. was she completely at fault for the entire collapse  no  i don t believe so  but she was a part of it and she refuses to take accountability for it.
i think frosk is an attention seeker. the moment frosk wasn t brought in conversation  frosk decided to act  and  do something that will make people talk about it ! ... frosk might be smart  by not letting people foget  -
g4tv had bigger issues than the feminist rant she went on. i tried watching their show and they made fun of their office table for 5 minutes. it was ridiculously stupid. i don t even remember frosk in that skit  it was just pure stupidity.
when you let the wrong ones in you get saints row reboot!
bahahahathe lord is the best troll of us all!if you leave it to him to deal with the weirdos  you quickly learn he has a great sense of humor
i m leaving the industry. ok bye.
after the wii craze died  i haven shown members of my family of of the switch stuff nor talked about gaming.i m keeping that with the people i know that play and aren t sex crazed assholes.
hey frosk it s just a game ! and whatever job you had was just work and not a crusade
she ll be fine. people like her fail upwards all the time.
how can you quit something you were never a part of like all feminists  she doesn t give a  h!t about the industry she imposed herself ontolike all feminists  she saw people having fun and simply could not let that stand
i have been angry for a long time with my peers.  counseling works a lot better than projecting upon your soapbox.
i don t feel sorry for any of the individuals this happened to on g4 or in the gaming industry in general because gaming journalism is supposed to be a profession of some kind and as one who associates yourself with such there is a certain degree of professionalism you need to keep when engaging with your audience or expressing your opinion.frosk  as well as anyone else  should have remembered to keep things strictly about gaming  no one wants to hear about your opinion on ethics or politics or agenda s or any thing like that  we don t need to hear you sound off about things that generally don t matter or that are blown out of proportion in the gaming media space.the same thing can be said about adam sessler s behavior  he was at his best when he was just a personality keeping you informed about gaming and technology and what he was interested in  in those avenues  simply just keeping the audience informed.i personally feel as though certain people have been allowed to hijack what we have always loved and enjoyed about gaming and twist it into something that it shouldn t be about so that they can use it as a platform to make a bunch of noise with and it s disturbing. i won t pretend to know the metrics behind how well g4 was doing during it s come back  but whatever momentum they may have had i am sure frosk ruined that by alienating the potential fanbase with her self-centered rant and low key dragging of morgan webb for no reason at all. she essentially burned down the house they where trying to build because she wanted to push the narrative of  sexism . either way if she s gone from the industry then good  the only impact she seems to have had in it has been a bad one.
you know what isn t fair  when you watch re-uploads of xplay and attack of the show during lockdown like they were releasing. being excited about g4 re-launch. hearing they picked this twig and being super disappointed. i was one of the first comments and i said to g4 at the time  why can t you just pick some fresh college kids like you did back in the day  go set up shop at an acting school and hire the gamers . but no  they ll drag some used roast who plays for the other team with a face for radio instead of some girl who s bubbly and adorable. mad girls who play games that are sexy and can read a script. why you gotta get some shoutcaster  and sheesh if you wanted to hire shoutcasters  should get artosis. he was looking for a reason to leave korea. but no  wrong genitals right
she s  quitting  the gaming industry because people wont stop flaming her about single handley destroying g4s reboot
mgkaren has left gaming  oh sweet mary of mordor what shall we do........i know...lets celebrate
they say if the mac doesn t wear a vest she turns to dust when there is a full moon.
frock is still totally clueless and can t assume fault for her actions   words.
frosk has woke main character syndrome and thought she was going to ride into the gaming industry on her white high horse and save womanhood from all the mean  right wingers  and then be hailed as gamer girls ultimate savior.
i think her going into another industry is a bluff. who would hire that actual goblin ever again  unless they want to ruin their brand of course.
unless all g4 tv ran was cod highlights or whatever  making generalisations about gamers is not so different from making generalisations about  people who watch movies . i think frosk needs to work on being more inclusive.
never have i or others including randoms online have i heard or see any man playing any game put women or girls down for being a woman girl or heard i m not playing with a woman girl just because they are a woman girl  the discord i am in has about 1000 peeps and its about 50 50 ratio women to men  we have movie night where we all get together to enjoy 1 or 2 movies a week  we play a lot of end game content in gw2 and it doesn t matter who you are  just be good and play your role  that s what peeps want when gaming  if you re not  then we have training for said peeps. all gamers want you to join  come to the dark side and play their game  we don t care who you are just join us. also don t talk about woke culture or politics  no one wants to hear that shit  we are gaming  good times! if at anytime someone says something you don t like just tell them or call them out. we are not made to get along with everybody  you might join a group that you don t like their humour or they might just be boring  just find another group of people  no need to stay somewhere you don t like  that will just make it worse for yourself and you will make yourself feel either left out not involved or victimized  just leave find new friends  somewhere you ll be happy
if so many people agree with you but have to keep quiet for fear of losing their jobs  isn t their cowardice part of the problem  as long as it s easier to give mobs what they want than actually stand up for your principles  nothing is going to change.get leaders with spines into the industry at every level. it s way past time.
oh wow a late christmas present! now my question outside game journalism who would hire her  she turned herself into a poison pill for any company. unless it s another ultra liberal company whose going down in flames anyway. as for her standing for gamer girls  i know plenty not one like her. even the ones who agrees with a few of her points.
in other news dragonflight is going well and ulduar released today i think pretty cool also melanie is cool
supporting frosk after her rant comments is akin to running back into the inferno after being dragged out.just wish she didnt destroy g4 and instead ranted on her personal social media. wish they would go back to hiring based on actual talent and not to meet a diversity quota  im tired if seeing potentially great games ruined cause the little talent love get ignored in favor of dumb stuff.i just see the male feminists as simps hoping being a yesman will get them laid.
that is called platitudes and lip service these people do.
some people really put a lot of effort into their virtue signaling.  i saw a friend from hs on facebook  keep in mind we are 40 now  and he was jabbing at the silly mlk statue that looks like a phallus or a turd and cost 10 million dollars.  my other buddy from hs  white dude who was never at all lefty back when i knew him   came in and lectured him how bad it was to disrespect mlk on such an important day and how he should be celebrating the statue and all this.  it s pretty ridiculous considering even mlk s family has publicly said they think the statue is a little weird.  so i look and see my old virtue signaling buddy now works in the film industry in a very large city....so that explains it.  they are all obsessed with their dogmatic religion basically....that s what they have made it.
make a video about the new tomb raider dlc coming to power wash simulator!
don t let the door hit you on the way out frosk. bye  you won t be missed.
like 80  of the gaming industry has always been predominantly male  coming in and calling them all sexists and then expect them all to go with it  that s not how to get gamers to ever follow you.heck boys love girls in gaming  do you know how ecstatic we are when we meet a girl who s into gaming  there are bad eggs among us  but what do you expect from millions of gamers  there s bound to be bad eggs.not to mention  boys want a girl that games as they gf  we would love to get a girl to share our fun with.frosk insulted provably the most open handed community in the world  and wanted everyone to join... leave the community alone  if you find our bad eggs call them out  but they are the minority
gammer women who have a lot of brothers know exactly what it is like just hanging around alot of guys who either have controllers in there hands or not.
for all the pushback and drama we saw with gamergate  gamers were the ones that actually lost that battle. games have continued to be progressively more woke and more trash. normies think that tlou is the greatest tv show ever  yea wait until they get to season 2 and find out what happens to joel haha!
would be great if we could all just agree to disagree but sadly doesnt seem like the world we live in anymore. sorry to hear about your token spot on a wow panel. i d imagine that would be rather annoying considering you don t know much about the topic. i do know women who play games often but sadly most aren t quite of my ideology. nice to know there are some who are.
oh no! whatever will we do without frosk urine
frosk actually criticized the entire tomb raider games as being  sexist  and designed to appeal to men.when in truth  i think i know that there are more female tr players than males.most of the best tr sites  like stella s  are run by women..the majority of streamers playing any of the older or newer tr games were all female.so it was bizarre to hear and see her trash the games and franchise.
carry on like nothing happened.
she s leaving  didn t know she was still here
let s be fair  g4 was in bad shape before the mouth-breathers decided to attack their audience.all those two  frosk and sessler  did was accelerate g4 s demise.
pretentious adjective   behaving in a way that is intended to impress other people but seems false or too deliberate.this word perfectly describes the most recent cast at g4.  so frosk should not be surprised when  no one has her back  when they are all that fake.kevin pereira and olivia munn always seemed to genuinely enjoy entertaining their audience.morgan webb genuinely had a passion for the topics she presented.all others are completely fake  which is why there are multiple youtubers out there who have a genuine passion for this industry and who constantly outperformed what a multi billion dollar company could not put together.
well  at least we got chrissie mayr s frosk out of this.
the  anti-sjw  soft civic nationalist content creators made frosk more important than she really is. frosk is not important  g4 is irrelevant  we should have bigger fish to fry.
they were trash even back thenwatching their anime game reviews  anything mega man related  or sony they d bashsessler told anime fans to end themselves for liking dbz budokai
g4 was not in great shape but frosk ruined any chance at course correction which i believe was previously possible. did you see how weeks later they had amouranth on the show to try to retain their fanbase after the fact  could have been successful if they lead with old g4 antics initially or even pre-frosk rant.
common complaint with mega man games include same graphicsdumb stories ridiculous  game titlessame thing everytime but praises every generic fps
@courtneyharris1006  they once said fullmetal alchemist is stupid because little boys turning into giant robotshe actually believes alphonse elric was  a robot
@starforcegeo321  haven t seen fma
@courtneyharris1006  still my point remains
well  i have a saying that comes to mind that is similar to  stoke the fires .  it at least starts with the letter s...
now the gaming industry needs to replace adam and frosk with a man who women like and likes women and more importantly games. and a woman who men like and likes men and gaming. imagine the conversations you could have about the actual games if no one was on some sjw bs. the industry may have some explaining to do for the shitty games too.
it s so sad because frosk has the potential to really improve the gaming community. . . by fading out into obscurity. nobody is interested in her crap.
7 05  or whatever  -a biologist.
i feel sorry for frosk.  she strikes me as an archetypal  feminist   poor self-image   and an unconscious desire to cast-off her femaleness  which manifests as a course meanness.i don t think she  quit . why  who would hire her  gaming news for masochists
is quitting what they re calling being blackballed these days.
games journalism is self serving  and can t be trusted 100 . i always try to research games from many different sources before purchasing. there are plenty of ways to enjoy my spare time  and support the advancement of technology besides games.
god still does miracles  and this is proof.
narcissist throws tantrum after scheme blows up in their face and people won t forget about it.
i ve been arguing this point for a long time now. when you hire people not based on skill and qualifications  but purely for the color of their skin and gender. how is that not sexist and racist
time to go troll frosk.......... god i miss the days of olivia munn
i don t think it was a scheme  i think it was just another tantrum.
hallelujah!
yes!praise lordy in heaven  o
damn straight
interesting dichotomy between you and her. she had the correct politics but zero fans or draw power. you have the  wrong  politics  but lots of fans and draw power. g4 should have hired you instead  but they went woke and got broke.
oh how kind of her
this has happened with lots of hobbies. gaming  car culture  shooting sports  scale modeling  just to name ones i have personal experience with  where more casual people join in  and rather than gatekeep them out like almost all those communities get accused of  they welcome new people with open arms because when you re passionate about something that is your hobby you want more people to join  but then there s an influx then critical mass of people who identify themselves as part of those hobby subcultures who know nothing about the hobby  ignore the people  who welcomed them and just allow corporations to exploit the hobby and wreck it for the original enthusiasts who now have higher prices  often get looked down upon due to horrible actions of the newer people  and we get crapped on in the media over the actions attributed to us that we didn t do  like with cars  i get crap from the climate people over having a c5 z06 and get crap from normies because  fast car means you do takeovers  no i actually love my car lol i m not gonna be out there destroying it and giving my hobby a bad name like that.
she was a day early for out of touch thursday
exactly
white knight  never seen that coming.logical thugz  we have seen it a mile away. general population  hahahahaha.me  that s interesting.
women come into male spaces  claim sexism  change the space entirely  and then claim they earned the right to be there.  gaming is just another example of that.  you cite your  lived experience  and claim that it s the universal.  melonie you do the same thing as frosk just say it differently.  it s the same basic message  just you say it sweetly and with a smile.  that s about all that is different.  if you did actually earn your stripes like you claim  you wouldn t have to keep saying it all the time.  stop the cap mac.
hi melonie! just wanted to let you know that brett cooper shouted you out in one of her shorts tiktok videos.
mac aged like milk   . she was one of the og egirls
and nothing was lost
quits gaming industry  aka gaming industry saw her destroy a company and wont hire her
the evil has been defeated.
she got a job at starbucks  that s the new job
oh yay  which one
@meloniemacgoboom  i posted a reply. not sure if it went through...
her next rant... unemployment in gaming.
what are melonie s opinions about the pandemic
people like that are just toxic and are trying to make the life of everyone else miserable by seing none existing problems
is it really that much of a loss
frosk go boom
people in the industry.. the ones she threw under the bus for some clout
what s your take on the steven crowder vs daily wire feud
their both awful the end
i don t even care what she says. i m just surprised to see a thumbnail video where she didn t look completely hideous.
say it with me now  good riddance
she will point her finger at everything but a mirror
pretty sure she didn t  quit  the industry   most likely after she got canned  no one was dumb enough to give her job !
i didn t even know she was still around haaa
ladies and gentlemen.... we got her.
how exactly was frosk d   in  the gaming industry   she hates games  hates gamers  and is not employed to offer her useless opinion.
7 30 nerds are unlikely to  go soft  when a girl is around. quite the opposite...
finally. today s a a good day
i mean  she was never really into gaming beyond using the medium to push her ideology.
you are so right.
there are some things men can only say around each other and joke about. you have to watch what you say when some chick joins yo party tbh. i have alot to say   but i leave you with thiswe live in a clown world and everyone is joining the clown car
smart.  subbed.  have a nice day!
next episode adam sessler
she torpedoed her own job and the jobs of a ton of people.
i babied a girl once in a cod black ops lobby once. she roasted me over the mic and proceeded to place top 2 on her team. she was prestige level 3  my
now  if we can just get briana wu and anita sarkeesian to go away...
i knew when it happened because the rain stopped and the sun broke through the clouds.
frosk does not play  video games she even said that she doesn t own a console
hey melonie  did you say sometime before that you were also on rumble or am i mistaken
i guess we will never know how she feels about red dead redemption 2 ...dahm haha
it looks like all her other teeth ganged up on that one tooth   merked it.
she looking for another industry company to poison
she wants to be anita sarkesian  but why would anyone want to
i love mel mac truth bombs.
fan the flames
the whole shaming and virtue signaling its starting to become like the boy who cried wolf and nobody is entertain the agenda anymore.and not just by ignoring them   we are at the point if its just mentioned everybody just tells them to shut up if that is one person if its a company most lose money like crazy when one of those events happens.
i think the gaming industry left them
willy wonka memeno stop come back
go frosk! go out the door!
back into the kitchen kappa
here s the thing. like you said  frosk s words are not wrong. there is too much abuse in the gaming entertainment industry. the problem is she is she s pointing the finger at the wrong people. she has a problem with toxicity in public games  why is she there  if being online with randos is that bad  why play online games  i don t because i don t like giant groups of people  especially online.she has a problem with discourse online about gaming  well  why do you think it s always toxic things getting highlighted  because all the social media platforms put spotlights on that kind of crap because it gets attention. don t complain about the people talking. complain to the people who are only feeding you that crap.also  i disagree wholeheartedly that she should get some credit for sticking to her guns. because that speech she made wasn t made from her strength. it was a tantrum. but she didn t care. did you see jirard s face after that speech  he was veiling complete disbelief that she was setting this fire to this company. he was scared for his livelihood and the livelihood of the people who worked on the show. he s run public companies. he knows better than anyone else what comes with that kind of drama or hate speech. but frosk didn t care  as proven later with the firings.she is a figurehead of the problems nowadays. she thinks herself strong  but only proves herself to be the weakest and most ignorant of them all. she is a hateful  narcissistic coward. even her convictions are tainted by hate. that is nothing to give praise for.
dont bite the hand that feeds you....
there s no need to announce your exit.
melonie you are so cute. love your eyes so much  3
frosk bitten.  lol.
oh she ll be back let s not kid ourselves
stand up to people for what what are they standing for who are they standing against their audience
because they where not friends. they are allies and they don t stand with you they stand with the cause. as soon as you doesn t fit thst cause you are out
wow ...   we got one thats starting to see
can you quit an industry that no one will hire you in
i don t consider anything these ppl say about gamers i think most of them have said publicly that they don t even write there own reviews meaning they probably didn t even play it or g!ne at all just tv personalities given a script
she should go work at walmart  nothing wrong with it
dear frosk   if you don t like it leave!   peace  bu bye!
the bullied have become the bullies...
insert spiderman memes
you d buy a tv from that
finally!!!
she craves attention. let s don t give it to her.
there was a year in my life where i lived for warsong gulch
bahaha yes  and arathi basin was my jam!
@meloniemacgoboom  ab was solid  i spent a good amount of time there  but on my server the horde dominated. we kept chasing them into the graveyard
lol gaming left her. not the other way around
lol frosk
hey frosk yes i want fries with and a hot apple pie.
her new industry is mickyd s
that circus clown never should ve did that filthy rant about  sexism in gaming .tell me frosk  where s the proof  where s the evidence  where s the receipts
why not post more positive content
for winning the trivia competition
haha thank you so much!
no one had her back  did she ever considered the fact that no one liked her
no one in the gaming business would hire her
if i didn t know who this is i would think it was justin beiber 10 yrs later
the irs is hiring....
and nothing of value has been lost.
how many times is she going to quit    seriously  she s one of those old usenet   fidonet  forum trolls who spent  months  quitting for attention.
and nothing of value was lost
i have been watching the streamers that i enjoy getting their numbers up and you have no shorts do you have to make shorts to stay monetized. i leave comments on their shorts. jay  rouge attraction  nina  anna  krista nova she replyed  saying i won a ps5 lol i know they now spam your reply s good video.
if you nead a character too...   make your own game and put it in.
next she should quit twitter and move to canada
i feel with her. i am so angry for a long time now  too!
she left... who s frosk anyway
good the less perpetrators in our hobby the better
good hopefully she stays away from gaming forever
did she quit or was she pushed out  because people got tired of her shit
delusional people mean what they say. egotists who are  never wrong  mean what they say.admire that if you want  but destroy their sanctimonious world before you relent on your principles  mel
she mad cause top 1  of men are not interested in her
bring back morgan webb
facts
she needs to go sooner than later
frosk quit  good. that hack must be held accountable for ruining g4.
she was still a part of the industry
why does frosk look more like machine gun kelly each day
frosk was part of the reason i stopped watching pro league.
maybe she can still get a job at ljn. lmfao
she s leaving! oh no. anyway.
frieza just mad she will never catch goku
we probably haven t heard the last of her  sadly. she s off the be a mediocre journalist somewhere else  i have no doubt. just  not in video games...
quit... burned every bridge. either way  same result.
yay!
yes gamergirl is an insult  thats the point  we all know 2-3 bint that  just want attention. real woman that respect themselves and play games are called   gamers   like the rest of us and i know a ton of them  those that pull their weight and are good at their favorite games
i only wish people like frosk and sessler and sarkeesian success on their new adventures so that they don t come back to gaming. stay away  we don t need their miserable and insufferable attitudes. the gaming space and industry as a whole is just that much better of now.
thanks!
who is this chick  i like the takes. we need more actual gamers that are women. subbed.
frosk has friends
thank you
who is frosk  !! xd
nothing of value was lost
frosk should quit from any social media too.
omg  there s a hidden easter egg in this video! start the video and then press  0   zero  key 3 times
of course it back fired of course people hated it   because nobody likes liars    gamers don t shun women for playing games   outside world shames people for playing them.   they keep trying to push politics into gaming and that shit needs to stay out of our games  unless it s a game on politics  like  election simulator lol
dude og cod and halo lobbies were the least discriminatory places every. everyone got roasted at some point  even if the insults made no sense.
after having been a member of tombraiderforums for years but not active and then returning to see all the shit they say about mel left me so angry and dissapointed. left after that......
o_o wait  that was you ! i m talking about gamestop videos.
there is no modern audience.
haha yup  i was a gamestop tv host for 4 years
good! she seems like a horrible human being and not just in the gaming space but in everyday life as well.
she should ve shut up take the l in games get back up and look forward.
ding dong the witch is dead
and nothing of value was lost.
sadly nothing of value was lost.
so... i never thought she was actually  in  the gaming industry... didn t she say she pretty much didn t actually play the games and wasn t a gamer  duhhh...  gamers game  silly wabbit. maybe someone should have told her that
and nothing of value was lost
i just will never understand why women complain that us men treat them so badly in vc or online in games. i m sorry but we treat other men way worse and most of the time  those other men give it right back and its fun and its just memes. its been this way since forever. and no  i don t think gaming should be less toxic. if you dont like people calling you a bitch or shitting on your online gaming experience  online games aren t for you. there will never not be toxicity in online gaming because there will never be an actual good way to police it  and you shouldn t. its memes and jokes between people who play together for 15 minutes one game then never again.
she was never in the gaming industry. she s a grifter.
u ever do it with your bros
she was never really in it for good reasons.as a result  she didn t quit  the industry quit her.and she burned her bridges on the way out. a class act all around. typical ideological zealot.
subscribed.
she was never in my gaming industry. good riddance.
frosk is what happens when you re ugly on the inside.
yeah its long past time she became the female gym teacher she is meant to be. get your daughters out of that school.
frosk  who...
just let her shade away to oblivibion  please  every one needs to stop talking about that human.
there is something wrong with frosk teeth. can t he she it afford decent dentist
so cool  the trash took itself out
not sure she had a choice.
she s leaving   finally!!!!
i feel like a pronoun change is inbound... gotta keep yourself in the headlines.
oh no  please don t
i will bring anyone i can into games that actually wants to play and have fun. however if you whine about how gamers are treating you and that blah blahblah needs more rep... i m done with you xd
nothing of value lost.
woke broke!!
frosk kun nooooo!
hey  melonie i just want to say that frosk can t stop running her dang mouth. anyway plus i am soooooo freaking happy that frosk is quitting gaming industry. anyway she is so mean and hateful person in the world and she complains about anything that she can think of and say on social media networks. anyway i am so happy for her to be done with gaming industry and i pray to my god that i do hope she can stay off social media networks forever and keep her dang mouth shut and find something else to do for living instead of being in the spotlight and on social media networks for her stupid rants that she has been on for years to now. anyway i just wanted to say and make a comment on this video and i just wanted to tell you melonie that you are doing a fantastic job with making this videos for us to make a comments on your videos  ok melonie. anyway great job  melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie. also have a great blessed weekend too melonie.
feminism  if i fail it is never me  it is always someone else s fault. men s fault  patriarchy  etc.
she s leaving the gaming industry ............ok  brah no one is going to miss you
but but.......shes the lesbian bradpitt! lmao
she never was a gamer for starters
and nothing of value was lost.
good. we don t need another variant of anita sarkeesian.
awesome video
you look tired in that video.
1st!have a great weekend melonie!
person who doesn t like gamers leaves industry that also doesn t like gamers .whatever.
yay!
what is a frost
all these supporting comments but where the f    are the likes people. support the cause.
good  please go!
eh   frosk doesn t even belong in industry in the first place ffs
boy  talk about a professional victim. good riddance  she did say  don t like it  don t watch it.  bye felicia!
oh  is she still relevant
haha  so if you don t side with her and bet your career  reputation  and future on her very polarizing opinions your automatically a terrible person haha. asking anyone to just blindly  get your back  no matter what you say really is delusional.
twitter is now an aiport for frosk to announce her departure who cares and  in that tweet she blames other and not herself for being so toxic.bye frosk. no one will miss you
and nothing of value was lost
who is this frost
what a loss. anyway
good riddance to bad rubbish. we need less people like frosk and sessler in the gaming industry and more like melonie.
good riddance. because unfortunately some people think  its only video games  and don t understand that those games are apart of our culture and influence the minds of young people if woke bs content to be in those video games.
ppl are not watching you for the genderppl are watching you casue you are sane
well  why wouldn t she leave  she spread her damage and bs. got to abuse her platform for things no other america get s to do  without having their lives cancelled  that is. good riddance to the gamer-hater. bring morgan webb back somewhere. i ll watch that.
generalizing gamers again lol what s new. new g4 was so watered down and felt kinda forced.
good riddance
go boom boom
i have been playing video games since i was 6. nintendo was my first hand-me-down system. now i m a god destroyer in destiny 2. i m 34. it s my hobby. we get assholes like frost complaining about sexy woman in a game  why  is girls in games hotter than her. what a joke!
frosk is a guy
bye felicia
let her leave. she won t be missed.
twitter drama show
i do agree with frosk on one thing -- she s not as bangable as morgan webb and olivia munn.
grumpy ass peter pan. lol
gl hf  nothing from me  tho
god is real
stop. don t. come back.
bye bye
good
oh no!well... anyway.
you said you have brothers. good. you understand that if i make fun of you  it means i like you. if i m polite and cordial  it means i don t like you. sounds backwards right  not to dudes. you have brothers  you get it
alienating your core demographic...what could possibly go wrong
another reason for being polite and cordial is because you might really respect and admire someone.
@jairik  i don t respect everyone i meet but i treat everyone i meet with respect. again my guy  if i m being nice and cordial  it could mean i don t like you. and you putting words in my mouth  well  let s just say i ll be nice and cordial with you. have a nice day sir. highlight that reply.
frosk that noob
oh no .anyway.
she was never a gamer  so
bye felicia you won t be missed
frosk   good riddance
why is she yelling
and nothing of value was lost... sad to see her degeneration  she used to be decent at casting league of legends
she wasn t a gamer. no loss to the industry.
waiiiit wait wait....why don t you get your nutrition stuff   imagine a second hustle that offers a whole other avenue of youtube content that really makes you untouchable when you make those videos and posts. people give you crap and you just shrug them off quite publicly with  are you certified in this topic
i do not have the time or emotional energy to add another hustle  i already get overwhelmed as it is with everything i do. i m also not money driven so it s just not worth it for me  i m happy as long as i can pay my bills and when i talk about nutrition on my instagram stories i don t want to charge people for it. if i ever want a break from content creation i ll consider it  but for now i have no plans to overwhelm myself even more than i already am haha
frosk  you re a hypocrite. you threw who you see as friends under the bus too.
hi melonie.
oh no....... anyway
good riddance.  couldn t have happened to anyone more deserving.  people don t deserve credit for standing up for their beliefs when those beliefs consist of just being an asshole.  how can you attack people based on their preferred entertainment for not supporting your preferred sexual partner
gaming journalist  has terrible  uninformed takes  doesn t even review the games they critique  gets called out as trash journo... must be sexism..
good. buh-bye
hi melonie
real gamers rise up
oh no! whoever this is will no longer be gaming  don t care.
my goodness  i wish you were the voice of female gamers and not the  super angry and ready to be offended  types we ve seen too much of...also lol at the male feminist observations
oh noes
@melonie mac go boom do you even still game tho
melanie how does it feel to be a sexist gamer  are you proud of yourself and the damage you have done  man i feel weird even saying those words is a joke
all the time
@meloniemacgoboom  on twitch same name  melonie mac go boom   i m a consumer of your content and do have a video suggestion. can we get a general take on the situation with andrew tate  i m not pro or anti-manosphere but love the takes creatives have on these things. anyway love the videos and the interactivity you have with your watchers go boom!
woke aaa games and movies are failing as woke sucks. it s not fun and it s not very smart either. take aliens - ripley is a strong female character  but it s obvious from her role in the story  and the film just carries on. now an aliens reboot would go on about how strong she was and how she s always right when the male characters are wrong  and did we tell you that she s so strong and special and brave and just the best  and the men are wrong  it s just dull and sticks out like a sore thumb  and people turn off. woke will die simply because it s dismal and eventually more fun to laugh at than go along with.
does she promise  do we care  good riddance to bad rubbish.
rekted
oh no.............. anyways.
male femenist
finally  she s so annoying
good riddance to her she wasn t a real gamer any way. just someone trying to push the woke narrative.
most of the new games are garbage  the industry is controlled by the femanazis and woke mafia. anyways  rather than complaining i could learn how to make games and make my own games if i don t like it they would say  and they may have a point.
good that women was nothing but toxicity for the industry.
all gamers are sexist and need to do better....hey where are you all going  lol
and absolutely no one cares
it s hair looks better.
are u single
this is not an airport....you don t need to announce your departure....just go. no one cares.
thank god foreskin is gone
xoxo
comment
sexism is just a smear word for normal thinking
