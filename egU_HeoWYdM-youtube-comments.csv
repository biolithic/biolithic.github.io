oh god lori in the walking dead was just insufferable. always pawning carl off on every one else. never doing her job as a mother. turning rick and shane against each other. basically telling rick to kill shane then acting scared of rick after he did what she basically asked him to do and killed shane. i felt so bad for the actress who played lori because she took alot of abuse from the fans because her character was written so poorly. they did try to redeem her in that last season she was in but it was just too late at that point. they also ruined andrea which really sucked because she was the best character in the comics. other than that everyone was great and the first 4 seasons were great.
i disagree that the sarah death scene was done well. they changed the soldier and never have him say  but sir  there s a little girl   which is the critical moment where  in the game  the audience starts to clue in to the fact that this interaction is not going to end well. it removes a humanizing element from the soldier and the conflict of his decision to shoot  in a story that is arguably about those internal moral conflicts.
for an opening episode that had to set the path for everything else to come i thought they did as good a job as you can expect. good  great whatever but i liked it.
you re right about the ages of the actors being some way off in relation to their videogame counterparts. in the games prologue  joel looked to be in his late twenties early thirties. pedro pascal is 47 and looked this even during the 2003 segment  and then appeared to have barely aged twenty years later  which is odd when you consider all the hardship he will have endured over the previous two decades. then you have sarah who was approx 10-12  and looked it  but was also precocious for her age  yet they cast an actress who s 18 and looks it. in some ways i appreciate this because it helps seperate the show from the game  and as someone who s a huge fan of the latter  this helps me treat them as seperate entities.
i can understand your points and this not the first time i hear about the looks of the actors  we used to see something else  and after 1 episode it will not feel just right.tbh i prefer some changes  they cannot copy the whole game  because the game will always stand out.i believe that as we get more episodes we will see why they got those actors  which are amazing in every show they play in.anyways every big title like this would get a lot of hype especially when it s hbo  and it s understandable  for me the episode was very good and true to the game and they did great job overall  looking forward for more episodes.
agree on all points. i just watched episode 2 and found the acting in the intro scene with the indonesian doctor and officer more compelling and emotionally realistic than the rest of the episode. i want to see that storyline with captions and all.
i loved the first episode. i do feel what you said at the beginning though. we are starving for faithful adaptations. all you have to do is stay true to the source material and the fans will support it
i thought it was great  far better than i expected. hopefully this will show studios that they can just follow the games and make good projects cough resident evil the witcheri think it was well acted  the effects were amazing  the tone was spot on the cinematography was good. the attention to detail  the little things help elevate this too. although i don t get why they want so in detail with making things as close to the game as possible but decided to race swap joel s daughter
i was hoping to hear your thoughts on this. you make a lot of great points too. i loved it but i didn t know what to expect going in. i loved chernobyl too and it sort of had a little of those vibes. i really liked what they did with sarah. for me it made the death hit that much harder and i enjoyed the dynamic between her and her dad. you made a good point though it almost felt like she was the primary caretaker instead of vice versa. making him breakfast  making sure he has a good birthday  etc. great video as usual!
corridor crew had a great new video about comparing anime to live action adaptations and why hollywood can t get it right. i feel like some of that same understanding is definitely lacking when it comes to taking a video game and adapting it to live action. and i m 100  with you on the main character npc observation. look at some of these ensemble shows such as lost and the main characters  now some of them are very attractive yes  but not all of them  have a real screen presence and main character feeling  and it s a combination of the writing  the charisma  the chemistry  but even other aspects of production such as the cinematography and how they are treated visually on the screen.
proof that game characters are not just  pixels dying
i agree with the opening statement. anything remotely close to mediocre is considered good nowadays because of things being so bad in the past couple years. some that s so used to one particular view  anything  new  would be considered spectacular.
i played the game and will probably watch with my daughter on friday. in the game joel was a bit of a survivalist badass and was initially standoffish to ellie s overtures of a father daughter relationship removing that from the movie will take a lot away from the story.
i think good but not great is a fair assessment  solid 6 - 7 10 - it was better than i imagined when i first heard they were making a show and saw the first trailer  but this intro didn t leave me as excited to get into it as when i first played the game  or even when i ve replayed it several times since.i wonder how good a translation to the screen the last of us can be since the games story is already quite cinematic and has already been told so well  and as a player you are actively involved in what s happening on screen  i wonder if this can ever be as intense. trying to recapture that so accurately  but with that degree of separation  the show is really going to need the characters to be as  if not more engrossing and well performed to be as good or better.
so glad you continue to be a critic commentator.. your takes are refreshing and needed
they were smuggling drugs in the show and selling it to fedra and using that to get a car battery so joel could try to find tommy with whom he has lost contact.i would have preferred that tess still take the shot that kills robert. seems to me they intend to make them more likeable and slightly better people than the horrible people tess claims they are in the game.
finally someone i agree with. i ll admit i went into the show kind of wanting to not like it  but it actually impressed me more than i thought it would. but nowhere near to the level of critical acclaim that it s getting. i thought some of the writing in it was corny as hell and felt like bad video game writing. i watched it with my girlfriend who never played the game and even she said the show seem kind of corny especially that whole robert tess scene. that scene is almost embarrassingly bad
presence on screen isn t factual it appeals or not and it can seal how the acting can be percieved  charisma   charm for example stands out and helps to set the mood through the character traits and its acting.
yeah  this fell short for me. agree with the whole  dumb-dad  smart-daughter  vibe. such a tired trope these days. agree about joel and tess  did not get the partnership chemistry they had in the game. tess herself seemed inconsistent as well. one minute refusing to throw a child s corpse into the fire with the rest  but then she can take a beating like a hard ass from a group of guys  nah  don t buy it. 20 years into a pandemic she d have seen  and done  much worse. also  joel seemed  l don t know  soft  in the game he wasn t afraid to do whatever it took to survive. very morally grey. in this he seemed a lot more watered down. can t picture this joel doing some morally questionable actions in his past to survive.
so i just started watching episode 2... and the characters and story in the intro sequence were more interesting than the present day story with the main characters. after the credits  i was disappointed that the intro sequence story wasn t continuing.
agreed   i remember i bailed on the show at the end of season 5  episode 8.  at the end of that ridiculous  hospital  sub-plot  where the younger daughter from the farm was killed in some stupid stand off with a corrupt female cop i think  who may have died at the same time...  it s been a while .  at some point after that i lost interest in the comics too  though i stuck with them for a lot longer than the show.  there was a lot they got right in the early seasons  but lori really was an awful character  haha.
i ve never seen the show so i can t compare the two versions. what i do know is that comic lori wasn t exactly a fan favorite with comic fans.
not nearly as insufferable as special agent weapon expert out of nowhere carol. killed the show for me. done.
andrea s death made me mad. she was actually supposed to end up with rick too  but they opted for michonne instead who was actually supposed to be with the dude with the tiger. some of the decisions in the show made absolutely zero sense.
