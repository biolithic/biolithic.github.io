not everything has to be centered around activism  gaming is about escaping reality  -melonie 2023.  i love it! perfectly said.
i just wanna give a quick shoutout to swedish gaming news site gamereactor for recently publishing a short article calling out other gaming news sites behavior regarding hogwards legacy. here s a quote   it s strange when large  big name  trusted gaming magazines and gaming sites choose to boycott the game and boycott reviews  guides and mentions because some people in the respective editorial offices think that rowling is wrong. in my world  that s not press ethics. god bless you  gamereactor. the only gaming news site i can take seriously anymore.
hogwarts still has the parts where the main character starts giving the player hints on how to beat the puzzle after a few seconds and i keep yelling at my guy  shut up i m trying to figure it out
it d be nice if it was taken back by people that make and play games because they like games. the geek world went mainstream and got overrun with people that at first didn t  understand what they were talking about  many of them became real fans and learned what they had been missing out on  a lot though never even wanted to game they just saw a way to push their messages.
melonie s streaming of the game is also making game glitches great again.that voice error made for legendary streaming content
this is so incredibly. i m glad that hogwarts legacy is doing so well. and the game is fun. even people who are not into hp are loving this game. and yes it feel like some game makers are taking gaming the right direction. team biggit army unite. hope your day is going well melonie.
up to 783 277 now. it has a ways to go before it topples pubg off the throne  3.25m  but it s currently  8 in peak players and that s incredibly good.
great for hogwarts legacy! i love that we come so far! i hope we defeat the woke left with this game!
i relate with your commentary and perspectives 100 . i agree that gamers tend to be rebels and  rejects . i ve always connected more with people who don t fit the mold. growing up  i wouldn t openly talk about gaming around other girls  unless i knew they were nerds too  because i didn t want to be judged. also  hufflepuff ftw  i m a hufflepuff too !
i love how everyone already forgot about  forspoken  and it s basically dead  it also doesn t help that it was hilariously bad story-wise lol
they should have known who they were messing with. you can t compete with hardcore competitors when all you do is cry.  thanks for staying on this topic!
the gameplay is so fluent and the content is massive. i really enjoy the atmosphere and adventure this game provides. also the combat was made very well and is fun.
i don t know about the industry  but it sure as hell demonstrated that the most yelling crowd about toxicity and abuse is not averse to using it on anyone they don t like.
i m shocked at how fun the combat system is. it has elements of arkham asylum  color coded shields and a surprisingly fun combo system. the only hit  i have is the ai is lacking. then again  elden ring didn t exactly have great ai either and i loved it. this definitely isn t just a hogwarts walking sim.
i ve watched a few people stream the game recently  and although i am very happy it was  a game   as we say  there was still a considerable amount of fetch-questing. that being said  combat looks super fun. i can t wait to try it!
considering how much many of these same people suffer from ptsd from gamergate  one of the last times the wider gaming community took a hard-line stance against their bs   i don t expect this to go away anytime soon. massive cultural victory!
love to see it! i hope we see more games that move away from walking simulators and innovate like prince of persia  sands of time did.
tptally agree with the  reject  comment. was shunned at school by the rest of mid top students. found a great set of friends that thought outside the box so was lucky indeed
i do hope we see more changes. i remember the days of mega man x where you didn t have a strategy guide and you had to explore. don t get me wrong  i love the yakuza games  final fantasy  and other games  but i always had a heart for the simpler times
i just finished this game. still have some side content to burn up  but all major storylines wrapped up. i can honestly say i loved it. is it the greatest game of all time  no  not at all. but it does so many things right that i just couldn t put it down. a love letter to harry potter fans and gamers alike.
but that s exactly what these woketivists are doing  escaping reality
@jenno contreras  correction  they are escaping reality  and then attempting to force that delusion on everyone else  instead of letting us enjoy our own delusions in peace.
@jeremy kennon  yeah  a lot of these activist escaped reality years ago and never returned...
@jeremy kennon  yes  that too haha. i could never understand where exactly these people are coming from with all their crazy lol
i agree with the quote as well. that said  i have no idea why people are putting hogwarts legacy on a pedestal. it is woke and clearly has an identity checklist agenda in the game.don t get me wrong. it is a pretty good game. but it would be better without the activist agendas.
@zack fair  no ones putting it on a pedestal  we who like games think it s a fun game  that s all there is to it. the left progressives  who you suggest the game caters to i wouldnt go that far  it does have some  woke  elements  but the game bearly puts any emphasis on them   have some unfounded believe that the game goes against everything they stand for  when that s clearly not the case. i appreciate the irony.
love this.
escapism is dead  - synthetic man.
-- gamergate 2014
that s been something said since the release of mortal kombat. the game that made the esbr rating system. people said that that game as well as doom was demonic and evil. the fact is video games have been an escape for many people for many years and a few decades
@zack fair  agree
i always used games like that to escape reality. especially fantasy games.they actually nailed it with this game. the story is good but not groundbreaking like rdr2 or god of war but the gameplay is awesome. this game is clearly focused on making gameplay good again. rdr2 had a great gameplay to and a great story but for me it is more important that i get a great gameplay than a story.
@jenno contreras  haha
@anthony gregory conservative game reporters back then were insane.always suing rockstar and saying school shootings were done by kids who played manhunt or gta.hell postal was a more obscure game with an endibg where you go to a elementary school but the point of the scene was to show how even a deranged person shouldn t be able to bring themselves to kill toddlers.but they removed it later due to school shootings being more and more common.
@zack fair  yeah if you are looking for that shit  last i checked i have seen the trans charactaer  i have beaten the game twice and what agendas affected the story and gameplay
@raf  what agendas affected dead space remakes not many but people still go on about it because as they say  small things will lead to big things they are brainwashing us people are overdramatic creatures always crying about something.
lol yup  if it wasn t for that it would be perfect!
mute all sounds xd problem fixed but yea it would be nice to have an option to deactivate verbal or visual hints
i hate when games do that. like why even give me a puzzle
if they would give us the option to shut off hints entirely that would be peachy. gosh  imagine if the old zelda s had held our hands back in the day. i don t think the series would be nearly as loved.
it s incredibly irritating. wish you could turn them off.
@lotus petal   imagine an easy water temple lol
do these change from easy to hard difficulty settings   i haven t really noticed a whole lot of hints
@aya wetts   doubt it the hints are usually for main story puzzles and still slim at that they just exaggerating
a lot though  never even wanted to game  they just saw a way to push their messages. perfect example  anita snarfkeesian...
it would be nice if the game companies and so called gamers understood what gamer gate was about. gamers  the game is running like crap why is it getting a good review. game journalism  you hate women  gays  etc.so called gamers  we need to stop the hand holding and git gud.gamers  we just want a game that is finished it does not need a day one patch on pc. why is that so hard to ask for  want to know why out side of ff7 remake i have not bought a new triple a game or even indy games  because i m sick of games that come to pc being called great and having massive performance issues. they coded it on a damn pc if there a bugs and glitches release it until it is fixed for pc. but ps5 and xbox. console fanboys and girls can suck it there. i don t want a console the majority of games i play are on pc i want the damn game to not have performance issues on day one. i refuse to buy new games for the pc until they understand that.
game developer told me that one should not make games because they like or love playing games.but because they love making them.
@orlokk noxx  unfortunately  they made the water temple easy in the 3ds remake. i was so sad about that.
@orlokk noxx  easy water temple  i heard some non sense in my life  flying squirrels  boris johnson. but that concept breaks reality itself.
@lotus petal  easy water doesn t exist it can t hurt you.
me who sucks at puzzles   can you please say that again
@colin morgan  nah  n64 was where it was at and i loved it. 3ds remake had glowing floors that gave everything away and made it way too easy and you couldn t turn it off. just like the new sheikah stones that gave you hints too. at least you could avoid using those.
oh god me too i m like yes bruh shut up i heard you the first 3 times lhh
@aya wetts  i started the game on   hard    they still hint at everything  not to the extreme  like some people here say  but it s still dumb.
@rodog  i ll assume its audio hints that might not be in captions and i don t get them since i am deaf  or maybe just concentrating hard to figure something out and not noticing the text if its there.
if its any rpg then that s why they have hints. oh wait we need to take everything that makes an rpg out of rpgs.
@lotus petal  they were not rpgs.
@evacody124  the zelda series absolutely are rpgs  and many earlier rpgs don t feature a hint system. what is your point
this was my biggest grip with horizon forbidden west as opposed to zero dawn. visually the game was stunning and the story was great. i d want to go off and explore but would then get chastised by the game for  straying from the path  you re an open world game horizon you can t have it both ways lol
@lotus petal  i love the zelda games but i would consider them a adventure game mixed with puzzles.
@a s  that s the way they dumb people down  by having games hold gamer s hands. when i go back and play games i used to love as a kid  they re so much harder than i remember  because games in recent years are so easy in comparison that i m not used to that level of challenge anymore.
@fortheemperor  that is fine  i would consider them adventure games mixed with rpg elements myself.
how do i get them to stop referring me to  they
glitches always make it more fun lol
@lvthor ascending  heck yeah they do! melonie broke the game in the best way possible
@otterloopb  lol definitely. nothing is better than being all serious in the heat of the moment then something goofy happening that cracks you up
i fell through the terrain to my death.  honestly  i would have been mad if it made a difference at all.  luckily  i had saved the game literally 30 seconds prior.
my favorite moment was when she was cursing in english.  eck!
@dakarn  maybe that s why it autosaves every 30 seconds lol the computerized voice in the beginning was funny. irobot lol
@lvthor ascending  no it does not make it more fun. wwe2k20 was a mess so much of a mess 2k was the only studio to come out and say we are taking a year off to make sure the new wwe game does not have those issues. i m not spending 60 to 80 dollars to buy a glitch fest game. why on earth do people like you think that s ok
@evacody124  it is annoying  i remember back in the ps1  ps2  and most of the ps3 eras they managed to release games with little to no major glitches and even minor glitches were scarce. now that they have the ability to patch games later they don t care nearly as much anymore.i ve heard game testers of recent games have been ignored or sometimes even fired for trying to make them aware of bugs. like they d get mad and act as though they re being criticized and they deny the problem exists.
did they pull it off steam charts  i don t see it on the leaderboard and when i search for it specifically i get an error. it would be hilarious if steam charts were trying to cover for the woke mob somehow. xd
@chris  same  i checked it the other day and got an error so i chalked it uo to the game still being in pre release. but i checked today and its the same. my guess is there is a woke working behind the scenes to deny it from the website.
pubg is online multiplayer game and it s very cheap  you can t compare those two.
it s a great start  it s even better not having frosk in the picture.
@lvthor ascending  frosk  i shudder ...she gives me the creeps
it s ironic because the game is filled with woke garbage i skip through  but the woke people never get to enjoy because they re to woke to play the game.
@nessa  personally  i don t really care if a game is a little woke just so long it s not pushing an agenda. i m just there to have fun.
@nessa  like what
@andrew robb  that s called the shifting of the overton window.
@aegis defense solutions  i don t think so. in a way  everyone has their own agenda and it s up to everyone you meet to deem it woke or not. in the end  we re all just human being trying to live our lives and we don t need to add hate into the bunch.
@gogeta 346  the woke left seem to hate this game for no reason so i m glad they re sifting in their own sorrows with the success of this game plus i do playbill because i enjoy it.
@jj c  that s just the creators just trying to meet the woke mob halfway and they still hate this game. it s still more reason to keep playing it.
@andrew robb  it s the reason to not give them money. i don t give a shit how fun the game is if it s pushing political messages. i would have already gotten a refund for the fuckin thing if i could.
@andrew robb  i can tolerate it as well  as long as it s not the entire game. don t get me wrong though  i m loving hpl! i just think it s funny the company pandered to the wokies when they didn t have to. not like they re playing the game anyways  p
@jj c  if you don t want to play the game it s fine but just because it has little wokeness  doesn t mean it s okay to hate it now. that makes you just as bad as the woke mob that hated this game and we need to be better than the left in order to win this culture war.
@moe s gaming  i know right  so glad we don t have to see or hear the mgk of gaming rant about her sexist gamer delusions.
@andrew robb  exactly  if we whine about a little bit of woke stuff when it s not trying to push the message down our throats  then we d be doing the same thing they do. so all the comments i see from them about  but you re supporting it by playing it  are just a bunch of goofies who can t grasp the idea of not being offended.
@yu lee  the whole plot line about the transfer student from uganda. her whole purpose is to be a black immigrant with an oppressive past.  she self inserts herself in your adventure to defeat a bad guy that reminds her for the bad guy from her home.  her whole story line just feels forced and out of place.  for example they mentioned some epic dragon hunt in scotland during an early mission. she could ve been a relative of a famous dragon researcher from uganda that joined in on the famous mission. then she could ve been involved more in the poaching story line  which could lead to an epic dragon rescue fight.  way better back story. this way we get a black character with a personality and not a victim cry baby.not to mention this is the 1800s in britain  there wouldn t be this much diversity  like it s a game so i can over look it. also in the wizarding world there was a bit more worldly travel back then. but there s so much diversity and it seems strange when you consider the setting we re in.edit  there s more like the insinuation that sirona is trans  but the above response is the biggest offender
@nessa  understandable i see how that would be sucky
it s a woke game  what do you think you are winning  it not being completely marxist isn t a win.
@imzgamer  what s the real line
@nessa  it is filled with woke which is why i don t get the op s comment. if woke is in a game it is there to push an agenda. that is what the ideology does. that is all it does.
@tech priest  exactly what i am wondering. strange comment chain...
@nessa  i agree with your first half of the explanation. they could have given her a more fantastical storyline  rather than a doom-and-gloom one  which actually made it seem like the writers saw her as not being good for anything other than playing the role of someone who d been victimized. i hope i made sense. the second half  in regards to having a diverse student body  though  it s okay  really  and you even said it yourself  the wizarding world has always been more wordly in that regards. their racism was less about skin color  and more to do with species  ya know  actual races .
@tammy r   exactly her whole plot line felt like an ideologue agenda in stead of a wizarding world character.  one the second point  like hogwarts staff is one thing  makes sense to have famous wizards from around the world teach at a famous school. but in the hamlet s  you re gonna try and convince me all these asian  indian  and black immigrants came from their homelands to live in a small dinky hamlet in britain  in the 1800s. this isn t london or a major city.   throws me off  1800s british hamlet that has every race accounted for  just wouldn t happen.  but i can over look this stuff  i m enjoying the game  but it is there and annoying we have to deal with. i m a trans women and even the stuff with sirona bugged me  it didn t need to be in the game. also why give her a guys voice  i know someone trans women can t get voice down  but most of us work really hard to feminize our voice  and she s a wizard  definitely a spell to change her voice.  so they purposely signaled her out as trans to be like hey here look wokies  we woke  trans women in game!! but i digress  in the end i hope this is used as a lesson. pandering to the woke crowd earns you nothing except drama. you can still be successful even with all the woke hate  so start making games the way you want and not what the woke crowd wants.
@lvthor ascending  but you are supporting it by playing it  did you somehow miss the trans and american  diversity  in... 1890s england
i also love when we  cone  this far!!
@pawnzrtasty  the sale numbers are making the wokies loose their mind so at least you contributed to their pain in a small way  p but honestly the games pretty good if you over look the woke shit  combat is fun  lots to do  beautiful world  tons of harry potter lore and titbits if you re a fan. the woke shit is awful i agree  but hopefully game developers can see a game can be successful even if the woke mob is hating on it   and have more confidence just making the games they want
@nessa  the game isn t bad. my wife was going to buy it regardless. i wouldn t have bought it twice is what i should ve said. i got it for the ps5 she got it on the deck.
i don t even know what that is  outside of a few people bringing it up as a footnote in comment sections the last couple days.
it got beat by an indie game that was shadow dropped without amy hype
whats that
funny cause forespoken is still  70 on pc when you can get legacy for  55 on greenman
the game wasn t even mentioned to have broke sales even. it did pretty poor and square enix doesn t even want to show numbers for shame it will bring a ton of backlash. hogwarts legacy  dead space remake  and metroid prime remaster buried forspoken 10 feet underground.
that game is like 20 seconds sex...
@eddie ram  gaming in 2023 is not off to a bad start
funny thing is   i play the game in french   sirona has a woman s voice. so in the end  it really is about what the markets is ready to accept and understand more than actual activism.
if the ai was any good  the game would be a freaking nightmare to play  since they don t follow the usual aaa  best practice  of only having one enemy attack you at a time. then there s also the part where you can t just outrange enemies  since all the  melee  ones simply teleport to you with every swing.
a harry potter game plays like the free flowing combat of arkham games thats freaking odd
there are some fetch-quests that are used to introduce you to mechanics or where to get certain resources  but there are no go to area x and grind mob y until they drop 10 zs.
@necuz  that s a relief!
the game is fun  mostly for the world and the spell combinations in combat. but it still falls victim to open world tropes. also  the game is simply not challenging  even on hard difficulty  which is a bit disappointing.  overall a solid game  probably an 8 10 on my scale
@joseph king  it sounds like i should play it when i can then
catch the toads! catch the toads! catch the toads! take their slime! take their honor!
i m going to play it simply to piss off the cultists. otherwise  i really had no interest in it.
it s an easy game. there is some repetitive questing  especially given by the professors. but keep in mind the target audience is probably 10-13 year olds. if you re used to things like elden ring or the witcher this game will be a cake walk. regardless  it s a good open world  tons of detail  and the combat mechanics are fun and engaging. it s fun  it s engrossing  it s totally worth the price and the time to play. it s just not a challenge.
of course there was a strategy guide for mega man x...we called it the schoolyard.
hollow knight had a good system  i think. if you re hopelessly lost  you can actually go back to talk to the elder bug and he ll bring up an area that you should probably go explore to progress the game along. it gives you a push in the right direction without holding your hand  because you should want to look around on your own.
mega man x is still one of the goat. and one of the easier games in that series  if you can believe it.
i also noticed triple a titles focusing mostly on high realistic graphics more than gameplay. this created a large group of fans who will never play a video game unless it looks better than last week s triple a title.
i was never even really into harry potter but this game is just next level.
reminds me of recently goldeneye re-release came out and most streamers i saw were playing it on agent  easy  and dying a lot. i understand that it is older and we aren t perfect but its depressing for someone like me who got the cheats and beat it on 007  hard  growing up  and that wasn t easy. i m not better than others but there is definitely something different with people or the industry today that should change
it s great to see games being actual games again and marketing to gamers instead of tweeters
i really hope this not only changes the gaming industry but the entertainment industry as a whole..i hope writers and directors and shit see this and realize that they can still write good movies the way they want and they dont have to try and be woke to make money and realize they will get wayy more viewers fans and wayyyyyyy more money not being woke
the only accessibility in a game should be in the form of a difficulty setting . hogwarts legacy has easy  normal  and hard. but  it also has a story option. so  it catered to everyone who could possibly want to escape into this world. ...can we all imagine elden ring with a story mode   also  as far as the 4 house openings after the sorting ceremony... i think ravenclaws conversation with professor weasley is the best.
that is crazy that hl got that many people to get it. also  i was a homeschooled gamer as well so i feel your struggle lol!
hogwarts legacy has been great! 10 hours in so far! my only complaint is i tried to make my character dwight schrute and he simply came out too handsome and i m upset about it
i love hogwarts legacy  i hope they make an only pvp as the combat mechanics is unreal to say the least. pure joy playing the game.
the only way to change the gaming culture is to vote with your wallet.
from the house of hufflepuff i am happy that hogwarts legacy is doing great.
as soon as game companies realize twitter isn t a real place the quicker the gaming community can rejoice.
just checked current players in game after watching this video and the number of players actually grew too now we are looking at 800k
they re trying to do it to atomic heart too! please cover this melonie!
make no mistake melonie you in a stream with nerdrodic and critical drinker means you are big time !! you earned it you deserve it enjoy it
we need to thank troy leavitt based guy who made a fun game
hope so  melonie. hoping they stop putting voice prompts in for the hints next or at least let us turn them off. have a great weekend melonie. nice to see a video even though you re enjoying a few days off
when i played fable and infamous i did my best to be good my first time through it  then i went back on a second play through and caused as much havoc as possible. not because i want to do it in the real world  but specifically because it s something i d never do for real.
spoilers never really bothered me.  i watched you and many others are watch  spoiler  me and i m still enjoying the story in my own gameplay.  also we play these games because we can do things we can t do in real life.
i love how in hogwarts one of the sub plots is about poaching and yet the best money making feature is capture and selling animals. don t worry little beast it s for your own good!    get in the bag! i need the money!
it s the soy it also severely cripples basic game skill.
most modern gamers would have their face melted off in quake arena.  -
he got kicked out halfway through so we don t know what he actually played a part in developing
the thing about having freedom of speech and action in video games is that it didn t take long to figure out who was good and who is bad not because you did something necessarily bad to an npc but because of your interactions to a fellow player. the imaginary was there for fun but the real was your interaction with the players whether it was something meaningful to you or to them you could show kindness or cruelty in your interactions in respect to them so you could easily make long-lasting friendships because you reveled in the basics of war or mercy of kindness or evil it was easy to figure out where someone stood because in a world where they felt like they had nothing to lose is the world they were most free to show themselves and could easily find kindred spirits plus in the end things that define you were having fun making friends being free and the skill to back up any trash talk otherwise no matter your actions or speech you were just talking out of both sides of your mouth
i hope that this will help publishers and jurnos realize that the real fandom rally behind those with a backbone. if you stick to your guns  it goes a long way towards good will.
i really enjoyed the game ! and i m not a gamer either. it was hard and fun . i never listen to politics in anything. i would rather be my own judge . and think for myself. great review !!
some games in the 80s and 90s were an accomplishment even with a hint or two.
i am having so much fun with they kept all the core things that they used in past games and added to it
i want to point out another thing. portkey games  as far as i can see  hasn t made sh t as far as aaa titles. unreal engine 5 enabled them to make a relatively smooth  great experience on what is their first major go-around. it bodes well for the future  cant wait to see more ue5 games
i m really loving the success of the game  but melonie  seeing that you have such a big wide screen  in that browser press ctrl and   and you will be surprised of how much dead space you had on your twitter   of course  is up to you if you want to do this  but i keep seeing all the fonts on your screen blurred out whenever you open twitter it s hard to read the smaller fonts that are not splattered over pictures and the like
this has to be one of your best videos. well said  100  agree.
i like that you mentioned the   reject  of the society thing.the fact that there are people in a work place when they discuss about general things if someone hunts and kills animals for hobby and another is a gamers and starts to discuss about it  who you think will starts to stop be happy and stops speaking about it when there weirds glances start to take place. on the other side the one who hunts will take credits like he is the tarzan of the city  the monster hunter of the anime worlds where the boar murders innocent people and only this  hero   has the duty to maintain the balance.
i m not surprised hogwarts legacy did well. the game is fun and enjoyable. i hope more western developers publishers will make more pure games  not scripted movie-ish like in naughty dog games and other games that have the same formula. thats why i currently play japanese and older games that prioritize actual gameplay first.
i think hogwarts legacy will shift the tides of video game writing.publishers and developers might believe that stirring up twitter with controversial themes is a viable marketing strategy.
i pre orderd the deluxe edition  im now 40 hours in and i love it. its not perfect by a long shot but its super fun. and its a finished game!
love watching the hogwarts legacy streams mel!
agreed in terms of game play being key - the first couple of uncharted games were fantastic...but with so many mini cut-scenes in the following games  just became very frustrating to play. you d be hanging by your fingertips  traversing a ledge  and suddenly you can t control your character...it s in the middle of an action event  and it would repeatedly remove control of your character from you. so much for immersion eh!
played it! streamed it and my subscribers had fun i had fun! i ve been a gamer for over 2 decades  since i was 11 i started  gaming ! thank you for putting this out there speaking out on our behave  my channel is to small to do that so thank you!
you re so right about gaming being hijacked by non-gamers.i ve been gaming since the late 90s and i knew it was all downhill since bethesda released horse armour  and i thought it was because i grew up playing games that i found games easier. but then i realized even on  hard  difficulties  it was way easier than it should be.
@melonie mac go boom said so much facts  truths and truth bombs in this video that it might have given woke crowd huge migrenes and many mind blows! i personally commend her! who knows how much more money entertainment industry would have gotten have made if only they listened to channels like her s.
honestly  im not even a hp fan but ive been loving this game. ive spent most of it exploring  doing puzzles and side quests. its so chill.
what a great way to start the year off but with an amazing game like hogwarts. i just hope future titles like star field can keep this up.
played my first games on tele-types  110 baud connections and home built consoles. never stopped. i m not an old gamer  i m an original gamer.  gamers rule !  who cares what others think of us. great video
100
publishers  maybe.journos  pretty sure they already know  and they see it as their job to undermine that.
@nevir202  among many things we need to start teaching objective reality in journo school again.
hell of a debut game!
as someone who loves playing games  but has trouble with coordination  i appreciate easier modes. why should i be called a non gamer because of this
@ascended nightingale  i didn t say people who play on easier modes aren t gamers. my point is that games have become way easier overall  with a lot of hand-holding. hard difficulty in games was actually hard. now it s barely harder than normal.
i m loving hogwarts legacy. my only gripe is too much hand holding.
i applaud the success of all video games  especially those like hogwarts and elden ring because it pushes the point that the general public  mostly  enjoys these types of content and demand more. honestly  even games like star citizen and the day before  even if they are scams  are getting enough global popularity that publishers take notice - even if they fall apart or get cancelled  just the idea that it could spark the creation of more hardcore survival or space sims is a win for me. i hope the big aaa will start putting more effort into developing single-player narratives  world-building and genuinely fun games.
happy saturday melonie mac! i enjoyed you on the mario kart stream this past monday with dan vasc  rippa  lady rippa and g g! please return to mario kart again with g g  dan vasc  rippa and lady rippa pls!have a great weekend and great upcoming valentines week!
great to see the game doing well and revealing some people for what they really are. lost a couple of friends yesterday by pointing out that awful wired review...but i m good with that.
to me the best part of this game is getting to watch and have fun with melonie as she s streaming it. melonie makes any day a million times better. we love you melonie. thank you for sharing your time with us goof balls. and may god continue to bless you. so we can get many more years with you. you look beautiful. god has done an amazing work with you. and he is with you.  biggitarmy  chaotichufflepuff
lovin your takes. taking the dark side track in games is completely normal to human behavior and is rudimentary psychology. we explore our dark impulses and hidden interests through fiction all the time such as our fascination with the news  serial killers  aforementioned video games  gossip rumors  war documentaries  etc. exploring our shadow archetype in a medium that isn t harming anyone is an idea as old as jung and older . enjoying the show dexter not the little russian accent red hair mad scientist   does not make one a budding sociopath  if anything it explores the duality we have within and reaffirms our moral compass to understand right from wrong.at my place of employment  i help people on a daily basis in my line of work with some of the saddest cases people will have heard of in their life  but at the end of the day i always choose dark side whenever i can first  whether in kotor  fable  infamous   and hopefully dark wizard soon when i get the hogwarts game   and so on. i still help a crap ton of people on the daily while still indulging in my shadow archetype with some healthy  evil violence in video games.
if only the opponents would see that we re trying to politely let them know that we disagree with them and they should stop pushing the issue against the 80  of us that don t want anything to do with it
so far dabbling in the dark arts has been the most fun for me. slytherin all the way.
when i was a little girl  other girls saw me as weird and shunned me for liking video games. i grew up with pokemon  banjo kazooie  donkey kong  sonic  and mario. now  kids like my school bullies are getting into video games and other  nerd  things because it s trendy  not because they actually like playing the games.
this game is the best game i ve played in years. many newer games don t keep my interest due to how spoon fed you are within the game. the challenge just hasn t been there.  but this game is definitely the exception.
recently came across your channel. i gotta say  so refreshing to see a younger gamer with a very similar mentality regarding gaming to me  who grew up 80 90 s and playing games for almost 40 years .  i noticed it about 5 6 year ago  people moaning about  minorities  not represented in particular games yada yada . that shit needs to stop  games are games for reason and created with a certain imagination and creativity. no doubt there will be similar and more salt about ff xvi closer to release which im eagerly awaiting to play   as there has in recent months. they re games  they should not need to panda or need to be representative of anyone kind of person or more. gonna binge some more of your videos now while i play more hogwarts
evil west is a true  unsung hero of the most recent  game-ass  games.a fun as hell  unashamedly imperfect aa title with great potential for future titles.
this should be an obvious call for a change in games but the triple a studios are known for ignoring the obvious.
just imagine. if not for the wokie boycott  hogwarts legacy could have had even bigger numbers  like almost a dozen more players.
gamers are the real marginalized group we are the geeks nerds and freaks  but also the place where everyone. i love that dnd  gaming and in genral nerd culture is on the rise.most gamers i meet dont care where you put your swimsuit bits. they dont care about race  beyond stats for thier character. some gamers want to play a character that is thier ideal self or to be someone else.  i ve met alot of very open minded  empathetic and kind people in person. ive have not meet one  bad  person irl. only online  on that angry birds app.my only complaint so far was the character creator not having a deatly pale goth skin tone. but i followed a modding tutorial to make my goth red head
2 08  the old tomb raiders were not difficult. the few moments i got stuck were due to not realizing that i could push pull something or that that wall was a passage. this is not proper difficult  it wasn t done the right way. same thing about jumpings  i knew what i was doing  but due to a lack of better positioning adjustment  i fell. this is not worth to be called  hard difficult . combats were also pretty bad and easy. i m glad all of this has gone.	i ll still play the 3rd  the only missing. they were good games. but for example  lara croft  guardian of the light was way better - and quite addicting. 2 24  tomb raider never was hard  it just got better mechanics. now it s possible to focus on scenario exploring and finding secrets  without missing an obvious step in the middle of an obvious path.10 00  overall  i m not a fan of open world games. i think screenwriters get a bit inhibited by the  crazy stuff  people can do  messing their stories. from games i played  i guess hitman series has the sweet-spot.
hogwarts legacy now has over 783k players as i type.   this game will be  1 soon.
because you stood against the wokies in twitch  you became a catalyst to start fighting back.
been made fun of all my life for being a gamer. i remember in grade school the jocks getting pissed off at me  because i would beat them in a sports video game badly.  but also at times i would get people watching me play because i was doing good at it and they were enjoying watching it.
i ll get around to buying and playing it. the latter should be possible - i got a steam deck during the pandemic when my attempts to get parts for a desktop fell through - but not inclined to buy an aaa game on the same month as i bought an oem copy of win10  still hoping to get that desktop built  and still not ready to move past dual booting . having been unable to find evidence that profits made from the game are being funneled into any kind of political or mercenary initiative to kill people  i don t feel my eventual purchase of the game will advocate for anything important. given how many works in the public domain i read growing up that i felt enriched the popular culture and my own experience  and given how much of their authors  viewpoints about the world i disagree with  i have trouble empathizing with the backlash.
if your  friends  ditched you because you have a different opinion about something then they were never friends to begin with. it s not only ok to have a different point of view than others but it s actually good. imagine a world where everyone had the exact same thoughts and feelings. there would be no innovation at all. you keep on being you and never take shit from anyone mate
@unwrittenspade  thank ya.
thank you so much
god has nothing to do with it. thanks her parents.
@faceroller  yes  god bless her mom and dad.
fight the goblins! fight the goblins! fight the goblins! take their arrows! make them fly!
yep. it was actually gamers who taught me the correct meaning of the word  race   which is  species   humans  goblins  etc.   not skin colors  and that humans are simply humans  regardless of how we look. since then  i ve always been a little weirded out whenever groups of humans are referred to as  races   lol.
i love that dnd  gaming  and in general nerd culture is on the rise that s why gaming has become insufferably woke. all of the posers invaded our spaces and now everything is hyper progressive.i would rather be bullied for being a nerd than seeing real life arbitrary political nonsense stuffed into my games
gamers being marginalized i still feel sounds very exaggerated.i know gaming has taken a decline but so has the movie industry and show industry and comic book industry.gamers are not oppressed or judged for being gamers necessarily.
@tammy r  i personally think thats a dumb meaning of race.i always kind of never understood why mass effect insists on calling the other aliens races they are entirely different species.and its not like its to not offend them humans are fairly xenophobic in that game and so are the aliens against humans.race is a real concept of a species itself i feel not something to change meaning to include an entirely different species.no one calls dogs a race lol.
totally true and not made up
this sounds so odd
to be fair on tomb raider  the impression i got was lara trying to protect things but actually being a destroying force in the latest games.  but i never played the original games  so i can t compare. i do agree about letting games be games.
listen  i tell my neices and nephews all the time that back in the day you had to keep being a gamer a secret and they think i m lying! the fact you brought it up proves you re an actual gamer
when gamers unite  we can bring down anything
with the success the game has had so far i  can t wait to see the reaction people will have when wb announces the sequel  p
hogwarts legacy is so amazing i bought it twice!  pc and console
i pre-ordered hogwarts legacy for the nintendo switch and i can t wait for it to come out this summer. im a big harry potter fan
not gonna lie  this game is 10 10 for me. honestly very enjoyable. there is a challenge  and there is fun in it. very well balanced and so much stuff to explore and dive into without being too long or repeating stuff.
i mean i ve only put 20ish hours into elden  and already it s made me a better gamer. i love the challenge
portal 1   2 are one of the only games out there in which the story is intertwined with the main game mechanic  shooting portals   portal 2 will always be a classic!
indeed. all the  innovation  has been on making games as  cinematic  as possible with realistic cutscenes and hand-holding. hopefully the success of elden ring and hogwarts legacy shows that freedom and fun gunplay with story that is woven into the game design  not the very foundation of it  is what gamers want. we like the ability to create our own story  to overcome difficult challenges  and to discover the story in an organic way that intrigues us instead of just watching a movie exposition.
awesome channel mel and geeat response. as a cristian man  i salute you. you got a new sub
enjoying this video as i play hogwarts legacy.
massive success of a beastly game. boycott failed.
it s a perfect game for twitch because there are millions of hp fans that want more content but have no interest in playing a video game. so tons of people are going to have a streamer as appointment television and watch the whole thing through.
a good news  positive video     -- hope this does as well as an  angry  video. appreciate it  melonie!  the question  will you be eating kansas city style bbq or philly cheesesteak  sans bun  tomorrow
2 55 i was about to say!  why not have good gameplay and good storytelling
turns out that if you make a game fun people will buy it  maybe other modern gaming companies will copy that.
it s always been fun to butt head with these weirdos  people just never  realized it or weren t strong enough to stand up to them.
i think games are mostly super easy not just for casuals but for games journalists who don t really like games that much and are just using their job as a stepping stone to get hired by the ny times or washington post. they complain about the game being too hard in their reviews and the devs end up making games easier because of it. so basically people that don t even like games that much are influencing how games are designed.
think i m gonna pick up a copy myself later today  as long as it s not sold out
no one hid playing super mario world or zelda in the 80sand definitely no one hid collecting pokemon cards and obsessing over those in my honest opinion boring games lol.
i hope so
wb is already planning more movies and hbomax tv series. zaslav said he s going to grow their greatest assets which are dc   wizarding world.
@lingr icen  thank you. you must be a really nice person.
@mo malo  see you have bad taste in people as well
@lingr icen  yeah very much. but hey at least im not filled with hate
@lingr icen  go for a walk
ehm...half-life
id also say far cry 3. you literally transition from a privliged coward to a hardened mercenary to a unhinged psychopath through gameplay
@al malone in a very wooden somewhat badly written way.i do not understand people suddenly labelling fc3 s story as a masterpiece of teaching about violence and one s desensitization to it. when jason seems to very quickly within a few missions become this hardened killer who enjoys murder he only was shocked once.and that isn t even including the fact you can butcher entire squads and bases before he s even suppose to be able enough to do it.spec ops the line i think does a similar thing and manhunt too and they do it better.
@chandller burse  well that s what jason s  friends  are for  a pusdo moral compass if you will. with each rescue they comment on jason s mental state or lack thereof. it also ties in with the player not really knowing caring about his friends  because his humanity is slipping away making room for this chaos hungry psychopath that s also making jason not really able to connect with his friends near the end of the story. also while i haven t played manhunt in spec ops the line walker was crazy from the beginning of the story becoming more and more unhinged as the story went on so its not the same as far cry 3
@al malone  they never do anything significant his friends are bland too
@al malone  walker wasn t crazy at the beginning  he was on a mission and over the course of it he went more and more insane did i miss something
@chandller burse  rewatch the ending it goes in better detail but basically walker just dragged his teammates into a bullshit suicide mission so walker can get some glory points and become a  hero  only making things worse along the way.just like conrad did in dubai
@al malone  still fucking better than hollywood kid becomes instant murderer.i don t get why badly received stories of games in the day are now praised to high hell it must be because stories have arguably been worse now.but fc3 does nothing special and jason s character is one of the reasons ubisoft stopped doing written protags.
@chandller burse  i d point that towards assassins creed and ubisoft autistic desire for the ancient civilization story that gets both dumber and more confusing with every entry.  yes the  maybe aliens  that are able to predict the technological and cultural advancement of a species that didn t exist yet a million years into the future yet can t save themselves from extinction
@al malone  hey people believe aliens did everything for humans now.ubisofts story is honestly more reasonable
that hit a nerve
yea! you totally showed them!!! those sjws thought they would get a woke game to fail  but you made certain it was successful! total victory!!!
btw  a tip.  if you get haters in your streams  or if you are in a streamers chat and these people show up.  the worst thing you can do to them  if you can afford it  is gift them a subscription.  that way anyone checking on them can see that they are subbed to someone streaming the game.  some have deleted their accounts over this.
hey melonie i am sorry for this being two days late but i just wanted to tell you that yes hogwarts video game is changing gaming industry and i do not have a problem with that at all but if other people have a problem with that then it s their problem and not ours  ok melonie. anyway we as gamers like it and will enjoy it as long as we can to play it  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to make a comment on this video and i just wanted to see if you had a great weekend with your family over the weekend and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed safe trip back home  ok melonie. anyway have a great day melonie. god bless you too melonie.
hopefully people are waking up to the woke power grabs like what almost happened to hogwarts legacy
hl isn t exactly difficult  but i did feel like i couldn t play it mindlessly on normal difficulty  i will say that.
hogwarts has ushered in gamergate 2.0! let s go!
it s really transcended all barriers.
i received it on ps5 as a birthday gift. it it so good that i purchased it again on pc. i needed to have both.
i just tried to reason with everyone on a cartoon fan group when someone used  hogwarts legacy to create a character from said cartoon and people just jumped on them for supporting rowling.... my god the stuff they would use to justify their bullying or debunked philosophy essays. i believe everyone is the same. but i will never ever justify bullying.
calling it a genocide simulator makes it sound like a magical version of rampage.
and i laughed at they tryed to please them with small things and well we see how that is they wanted to ruin it instead of just sharing fare with all people
7 16i m one of those people who always gravitates towards the morally  good  options in every game. i just played through both kotor games and wanted to do a dark side run  in 2  specifically   but it s always hard for me to do the evil things lmao. but then i ll also turn around and brutally stomp an old lady s head in gta without batting an eye  when i m playing a role in an rpg  it s just that  a role. i like to model my characters as close to myself as i can  and i make choices i d personally make if put in the positions of the player character. i like to feel as  immersed  as possible. but i know people also play games for the opposite reason  to play a role that is alien to the person they actually are. i m able to do that in games like gta where you re playing as an already established character with a linear story  but when playing as  myself   i treat it like it s actually myself. which kinda makes me feel good about myself lmao  because it is always my instinct to do the  good  thing in a game. with no one watching  no one ever able to know  i naturally want to help people and be the good guy. not that people who make the  evil  choices are inherently bad people obviously  as long as they understand what they re doing is separate from real life. and obviously  my choices in video games aren t proof of my character to anyone else  anyone can do it  but it s proof to myself when my intentions always remain the same. so idgaf what anyone says about video games leading to real world action  they re just an art form  and the most immersive and impactful form of media created to this date. no one can restrict how i wish to express myself  and likewise  i cannot restrict anyone else.
the game is super fun! i play alot games. this one is great.
hope you right about this  mel
i ve been a gamer since my first console in 1975 which was a pong console that had the gun for skeet and i m still gaming at 54. also  yeah  i was always given grief for being a nerd but i didn t care then and don t care now.
goblins have notoriously been hoarders of treasure. they have looked similar through many different illustrations. the hogwarts legacy goblin banker stuff is so ridiculous it s like people have never played any other game or seen a show or movie with goblins in it. and the house elves are the ones who are actually treated awful  not the goblins  the goblins work with wizards. the elves serve them. oh  and it s just a game.
have you played pathfinder  wrath of the righteous  it s quite a challange for the uninitiated  and higher difficulties are absolutely brutal. beat the game on  unfair  difficulty and it was the most fun i ve ever had in a game
well  to be fair  demon s souls and the dark souls were the ones who sick with games just a cinematic experience and decided to back to the roots  completely. elden ring is in many cases  a more beginner friendly approach. such success made companies aware that gamers like to challenged  and they will pay for it. roguelites like hades and darkest dungeon also made big companies aware they might lose their place in the sun. so  it was merely a matter of time
the game is great but it has several bugs that make some puzzles hard like the wingardium ones especially not sure 100  what triggers it but the end result is you get a uber fast projectile that can t be tracked.also i find the puzzles repetitive once you figure out the mechanics especially with merlins trials they are just turn off brain no real challenge. i
i ve been so bored with most game and now it finaly fun again we need more of this. i ve been stuck on ark and genshin because the rest wasnt interesting anymore.
i hope the game changes the minds of developers. stop pandering to them  stop apologizing to them  and stop fearing them. just go back to making the games you want. chances are the same people you are trying to get on your side won t even buy what you are selling. a lot of woke properties failed because the woke crowd just wants something to fight about. adding a trans character to hogwarts legacy didn t even satisfy them.also  being a gamer never bothered me. i never hid it. i used to even bring magazines to school. i hate that the word gamer has been turned into a bad word. some people don t want to be called gamer because of it. me  i m a gamer til the end.
til the end!
i m on ps5 an 43 hrs in an still doing quest i m lvl 32 i ain t gonna quit playing until i 100  the game it s a blast i been a potter fan since the very first movie i don t wanna stop playing lol
to be honest a game needs a good story as well as gameplay! if the story is shit and then gameplay has to carry the game!
well said  i couldn t agree more!
i haven t played it yet  but it should definitely get game of the year just to piss off those idiots!
right now  the ps5 is actually back in stock near me  but i have  8 to my name until wednesday...hopefully it stays there.
i m loving the game!
i just hope this games shows studios that being woke can only hurt your games  movies and tv. catering to a tiny audience can only hurt themselves
it started with elden ring hopefully it continues.
ay! fellow hufflepuff! i m super vanilla and on easy mode  though. goody-two-shoes and nice to everyone  i really wanted the ability to hex leander prewett in the corridors  though...the git xd. at least i shot a few incendios at him in dueling club . shocks me when the game features bandits and 15-yr-old mc burning enemies alive  suggests such torturous deaths for spiders it would make hagrid weep  gives me the option to extort money from npcs and keep quest items for myself  etc. xd. last time i played a hp game  i was collecting bertie botts and chocolate frog cards lmao.i really am not a hardcore gamer and would never imagine demanding masocore games be dumbed down for me. it s a bit of a bummer how dark this game is  but i can still enjoy it in my own way. this game is made for you guys and i m glad you re having fun. or peeps like my brother who are angels in real life but whose first action in skyrim is to burn an old woman down along with her house xd. it s also fun to interact with the community. many gamers used this chance to start reading the potter books and were having a blast  and it s heartwarming to see.
the key element to a good game  is the chance that you ll lose. the lack of struggle in games makes them so lackluster. if it has a combat system  that experience needs to be a struggle or any wins are meaningless. it s sad people have grown up too pathetic to handle losing.
i love you! ... why  ... because you named your hogwarts character ima biggit one of the funiest things ive seen on a stream for a while
melanie have you ever noticed  when this began they started releasing easier modes than  easy mode  like  story mode    aka  review copy mode  they aren t gamers.
i want game play  nice but scenes  good story  good va also..i want it all   ..i bought the copies one for pc xbox and ps5.
genocide simulator  always makes me think of the first  postal  game.
login into any mmo and gamers will give you the gear off their back  very true  that s the main difference between a good and immersive mmo vs a popular competitive fps like call of duty. the most annoying  aggressive  and i hate this word but it applies  toxic gamer base i ve ever encountered was call of duty and a few fortnite lobbies
@melonie mac  you might be right.  theirs other series also making a stand  like  mega man x  dive    it has some of the craziest cheese cake fan service characters iv seen in a long while.i m having fun watching you play the hp game  it reminds me in a lot of ways of  star wars the force unleashed 1 2   i wish we got 3  we do still get some amazing games for star wars  like  star wars  squadrons.
my favorite game right now is gtfo. one of the hardest games i ve ever played  too
to think  hogwarts legacy developers last game was cars. yet big triple aaa companies who release games every year can t even compare to hogwarts.
i used to be an edgelord and pick all the evil options  now i go good 100
the majority of gamers like myself play games because it s a game we like doesn t matter if it s challenging like frome software games tend to be or easy games  a game is a game as long as i can have fun im going to play it.
well most games basically make the good path the canon path so it just makes sense to me
@mr mistah evil paths should be canon more
@chandller burse  agreed
i do like some of these cinimatic games  god of war the last of us etc  but for sure gameplay is the best i mean ghost of tsushima was a great blend of beautiful story and cinimatics and amazing game play sam with spider-man ps4
my question about this game is do i have to be a harry potter fan or have a familiarity with the lore to follow the games story  i ve only seen the first movie and that was some time back.
the pendulum is swinging back with the weigh of the golden galleons. xd  also agree that gameplay have been compromise.  i started playing with the nes  the ps1 was probably my favorite era  with the ps2 been a close second due to volume  but i still prefer the game play difficulty of ps1 early ps2.  there are a few games from other platforms that will always hold a special place  like super metroid for snes and the guardian legend for nes.  the the ps1 is where is at.  all my nicest friends love playing gta  and they all love to get as many  stars  as possible and try to survive for as long as possible. cause mayhem.  yet in real life they aren t even confrontational.  any gamer that wanna get platinum  will play as the bad guy.  cause they need to compromise for those trophies.  and we can t help it.  even if it hurts us or feel bad  we will do it.  kill a certain dragon that we didn t want  or betray friends  or turn our backs on our people  or kill every dup member we come across. hell we ll date everyone we have too for those trophies.  at that moment it doesn t matter our personal preference  if we like the character or not. straight gay in between.  yeah  god bless japan and what they give us.
it s not just gamers  science fiction fans in general have the same experience.
that s why i love nintendo games the most. they make sure the game play is fun first
i m definitely one of those people who has always went against the popular opinion  crowed  or thought. for sure a reject  .  and proud of it!
i actually prefer games with story. always have.back in the day  we called those rpgs. final fantasy  tales of  lunar .... those were always there for us. yeah  all games have had some story  even platformers  rail shooters and beat  em ups  but it was more a set up to given the reason for it. you might get some cut scenes at the end of a level since ps1   ps2 xbox era.i think what has caused some of these struggles is every genre of game trying to incorporate more rpg elements. gear  crafting  stats  intricate stories have become central to just about every genre and it s watered them all down into being kinda samey.i suppose it s great for us rpg-centric gamers in some respects  we get more familiar elements and bigger stories in most any game we play  but i really feel for the fans of every other genre in the medium.
well more information everyone already knows. good job
both my wife and i are in our 50s and we game. i ve been gaming in one way or another since i was a teen in the 80s dumping quarters playing galaga and tempest at the arcade. nintendo   3do  playstation   xbox   pc. played games with my three sons when they were little kids. now  my oldest is a game designer animator  at firaxis. gaming was our escape and our family time. we ve met and made great friends around the world playing games over the years. it is encouraging to see the return of great games created by gamers for gamers. the wahhhctivists just fafo.
april 4th i ll be playing it 2 hopefully the ps4 copy is in good running condition so i don t have to return it that s the great thing about factory sealed physical copies power to the gamer not big business
melonie  i d love to see you play the castlevania requiem on ps4. it s castlevania rondo of blood  1993  turbo grafx-16 cd  and symphony of the night  1997  sony playstation i d love it and i m not alone
im a true gamer. whenever they told me to do main story quest  hell no i will never do the main story quest.
only good things will come out of it.
this game is great and owns the libs. 2 birds with one stone. gamers rise up!
i agree but also tlou2 and uncharted4 are some of my favs
took me 15 years to complete the original tomb raider  was proud i did it.
easy and accessible games are a good thing melonie.all games should give the player the option to choose their preferred difficulty ranging from beginner to ultra nightmare.
i think it s just that gamers have been waiting for a real game that is actually fun to play and not just money taking machines. remember when they said single player games are dead   bcoz they cannot monetize them  i mean even most  triple a  games aren t even playable or finished when released with the overmonetization.
elden ring is probably one the best gifts in gaming i ve ever experienced.  and i have been loving hogwarts so far  such a great game. i m not even that big of an hp fan  i just love me a solid rpg.edit  and the community of  folks  who oppose hl and police speak and other beliefs  they re the meanest people. just nasty attitudes  if not downright cruel. like frosk for example  ever imagine anyone saying she s a nice person  a sweet person  no  just utter meanness throughout their whole being and life. it must be a miserable way to live.
in aaa gaming  yeah they ve been subsumed by the woke easy gaming. check out indies though you ll find some hard stuff and some really easy stuff but it s indie you never know what you ll get
no  lol. the hp fandom itself runs a gamut from a to z 1. fans of the books but not the movies.2. fans of the movies but not the books.3. fans of the games only.4. fans of all three.5. fans of the books and movies  but not the games.6. fans of the books and games  but not the movies.7. fans of the movies and games  but not the books.8. fans of specific book s  and or movie s  only.9. people who d enjoy the books and watch the movies  but aren t fan-fans and don t give a poop about the wizarding world.10. insert your own combo here.
@tammy r  good to know. from what i m hearing the game sounds good  just don t know much about the lore behind it. thanks for the information.
they have been just as bad lately releasing half finished games like switch sports and mario strikers.
@kcadventures isn t mario strikers a gamecube game
then none rpg fans are saying they need to have less story in rpg games. i would just say how about they stop asking for more rpg elements in games fixed the problem right there. if they don t want to play a game with a massive story with people talking and cut scenes then they should not play rpgs. if they don t want quest logs and maps that have helped rpg fans then don t play rpg games. they added quest logs to rpg and map markers to the in game maps so that rpg fans did not have to keep a damn note book any more. quietly of life improvement.
as a kid i always thought rpgs meant the game had story choices that affected the endings.but i also remembered paper mario is an rpg.
me too!!! i m in my 50s  my partner is in her 40s and we both love gaming  -  i just don t understand why so many people think it s only for children. it s gaming. it s better than going to vegas to game  and people accept that as an adult activity readily.excelsior!
it took me 6 years to beat the legend of zelda  a link to the past  and it was an amazing moment watching the triforce in the backroom after defeating ganon.
agreed  fromsoft s whole soulsborne kiro  catalog really is on that level for me as well. i will simply never get tired of playing through those games.
elden ring is not an rpg.
i loved the fable series  you get to choose your story and i like that. like in fallout you get to kill whoever you want  and i like knowing i can do literally anything and test the game a bit to see how degenerate i can be. in fable there s light and dark path. like theft and murder leads you to become a demon  and helping people and saving them will give you a halo...nowadays you get weak soys who can t go 2 seconds without getting triggered. i m gonna guess they have never visited a cod lobby during the early 2010s...
jkr did nothing wrong
hogwarts legacy is a serious game. i ve started the game on hard... that was a serious mistake
now avalanche needs to fix the performance on pc. i m seeing a lot of reports of poor response and frame rate drops on the steam version  possibly because of denuvo. hopefully  they will do some optimization.
going mainstream was the worst thing that could happen to any hobby.i don t consider hl as big of a win as other people like to pretend but the social media   gaming press meltdowns were fun anyway.
i hope so. its a good game
what the wokes don t realize is that the  controversy  they ve conjured around the game has made it juicier and more alluring and tempting so they ve failed.
what are your thoughts on harry potter as endorsing  witchcraft   i went to christian high school and i remember the drama teacher hating hp for it and that christians shouldn t read it  same with pokemon endorsing  evolution    so i wrote up all the christian symbolism in the books  i gave him kudos for reading it though. i had two classmates who loved harry potter i could talk to about it but my best friend wasn t at the time  and now her little kids are.  one was christian but her parents let her be a fan as long as she understood it was fake .
just to put this out there  ghost of tsushima  was a great gameplay game  and hogwarts legacy is fucking dope  got the digital deluxe and been playing since february 7th.
i like your approach  your logic is sound  don t dictate to others what to do  apply your beliefs to yourself and not to others . i like that a lot  it s a super healthy way of thinking. as an atheist myself  i always felt that  but it s great to hear it from a christian as well. massive respect for you! anyway  you re in my top subscribers at the moment  keep up the great work. go boom!
exactly  i don t see people going after the sith players in star wars the old republic  where some options include actual genocide....
congrats to the hogwarts legacy team! suck it  wokies!
fun to push back against the mob.. but let s not take it too far and lets just have fun.
i purchased the game and its better than all new games and last years games too
all hail the iron age! we are taking this shit back for the real gamers and we need to gatekeep these fake weirdos who were never fans to begin with.
when i tell people i play computer games they think i m immature and wasting my life.  fyi  i have a degree in engineering and run my own business. i m also 61 so i ve been playing computer games for 40 years now.   non gamers never understand.
i think uncharted integrated gameplay and cutscenes really well. never felt like they were in the way interrupting the overall experience  so i had a blast playing them  same with nier automata and some other franchises. seeing so many games lately departing from what they originally were is really sad  especially with ips from the 90 s.
hey pretty melonie yes hogwarts legacy  is a great game  made for old fans and new gamers to just enjoy and haters can cry all day but gaming industries just won.
i think elden ring started that great trend. there have been some diamonds because of it. hog warts is another. ff7 remake would be good if it hasnt been sat on for years now....
i call my stream the right to bear wands.cause i thought it would piss the left off.
there  the new version of denuvo is likely to be even more loaded with crap that make this poor performance.
i had the same issues  there was an update yesterday that seems to have eased the stuttering somewhat.
ghost was awesome. hope they bring it to pc.
i should be studying for school. instead i m playing a game about being in school.....wtf
i m pretty sure the peak on saturday was like 632 000.
there s no option to turn off hints   i ve been seeing that option in my newer games.  i m waiting for digital foundry to review the game before deciding to play it on a pc or a ps5.  i prefer a pc for a variety of reasons but pc ports lately have been a stuttery mess due to ingame shader compilations.  it takes months before they get around to fixing it.  i expect the game to sell well because it sells on every platform including the switch.  the game should prove interesting on the switch.  too bad the game does not support cross-progression.  that way you can take it on the go with the switch.
i haven t played a game this hard since witcher 3. hogwarts legacy is goty!
there was a time mainstream powers insinuated and warned that gamers run high risk of becoming violent  sociopaths  murderers  99 percent of us gamers said cmon dude this are just a games  a beautiful escapes from reality and time wasters  i wonder how many of those powerful people will see the problem that politics and activism can become in those same simulators  time to see how many of them will stay normal in this so called dangerous environment.....
the only reason these people became  gamers  is so they can spread their misery even further. they can t stand to see people enjoying themselves because they re so unhappy with their lonely  miserable lives.
agree with your take on gameplay vs movie  that s how i feel with new god of war games  i feel they went too heavy on story then gameplay when you compared it to the old series. don t know why they couldn t have that as some like to look at it as a  serious  story but still have the gameplay of the old series with the game camera pulled back  doing combos and lots of weapon choices.
this is why we need to gatekeep
hogwarts legacy is actually pretty woke.. it feels like the hate mob actually did influence it s development because there s a decent amount of pointless lgbt points thrown in your face. i ll let it slide because the game is really well done and fun but... there s a disproportionate number of gay  trans  etc npcs as you explore and you can make your character trans. i think that s a bit silly and excessive but at least it s not preachy about it the characters are just there and make it obvious they re part of the alphabet crew
in my time playing ps4 for 5 years  this gen was about story based games  out of the box thinking games like stray  man eater   big games like jedi  ghosts  hogwarts. you also have the online boom with fortnite  call of duty   pubg. ps5 needs to be bigger   with the people we have in the gaming industry right now  i see the death of gaming on the rise.
gotta love when an atheist or agnostic person tells a christian what is permitted. like they know. to me its like a blind man telling me what a rainbow looks like. i like what you said too. my pastor said live your own convictions  and preach christ.
i have to say it the current god of war is a pretty cinematic game.
i noticed that you need a male and female magical beast in order to breed them.. lol u know u live in a crazy world when that s considered  edgy
who are you gaming with  my first dungeon in wow i got kicked right before the final boss  the one u kill for a mount. they called me a noob. it was actually pretty funny.
what s funny is a lot of hogwarts legacy is woke  trans character  gay characters  tons of diversity  etc.  and yet it s the woke mob trying to cancel it  they re fighting themselves at this point.
yesterday i got a random message on my xbox while i was playing hogwarts legacy that just said  that is a cool game  or something to that effect.
it s funny.  i am not really a  nerd  type at all.  but i love video games. back in the day i used to have to hide my love for games so i wouldn t be cast out by society lol. i m glad i no longer am a closet gamer.  screw society.
the german public television  which is funded by force  is now telling even children that they are not allowed to play it  now i m buying it too.
your starting to lowkey garnish fame .the butter  tweet is how i discovered you.
funny part is it s the most inclusive diverse game i have ever played and i have been gaming since 1995. just shows how giving them what they ask for doesn t matter they will literally cannibalize themselves.
and that s why any game that comes out that is a mess on pc should never be called game of the year. which the irony of it all is all games are made on pc.
the game was gonna be progressive anyway since they were going there own way with the make your wizard thing.being able to make a trans character was another thing they added to give the game something extra and to separate the game from the creators comments
what lgbt points are thrown at you and do the npcs just tell you what they are in game or is it just shown somehow
why take the story out of rpgs  if you don t like story in rpgs then don t play them. stop wanting to have rpgs just be any action fest game. right now i m playing ff14  the witcher 3  and kingdoms of amalur. they are all great rpgs with a story because that s what rpg fans what is a good story to go with the game. for all the good the game play was with ff8 it sucked because the story sucked. mass effect andromeda was not bad because of game play but because of story. at some point none rpg fans need to understand why rpgs get low scores it s not all about the game play.
call of duty has always been booming.
@evacody124 i think he means the cinematic narrative story games.he never said anything about removing stories from rpgs.
permitted about what
@godworksout  that is what i was wondering.
i deleted my comments. there is no point. you do you and i will do me. i just wished you would apply your own advice to yourself especially when it comes to telling people what is and is not permitted.
@seokjinnies unite  whoever was telling melonie a christian can t play a harry potter game. thats what i was talking about originally. i believe it came up at the end of the video. and i am not telling you to do or not to do anything. have a good one. oops sorry.
this line of saying is easily turned over the other way.especially when it comes to young earth people or worse . flat earthers  shivers or even worse than that dinosaur deniers  gasps i am also a christian.
@jonathan baker thats what some christians do like when conservatives use to cry about gta.it means little in general really it doesn t entail anything.
@chandller burse  i remember the gta3 out rage. i played it to vent. later when god gave me hope  i didn t want to anymore. but i can t tell people to not do something i did as if they ll not be forgiven for it when i was. but i do criticize the choice people make to vent violence in the respect that  god looks on the heart of man. we can say it s just a game  but we know if that is actually true for us and if we know  god surely knows.  but still that s our individual struggle to work out with god.
inclusive and diverse to the point of absurdity... that being said  it s tolerable because it s not done in a way to beat you over the head with politics... the latest need for speed has you in a car being lectured about blm and transformer propaganda
@@stasiost isn t the school recruiting kids from around the world
great game!
what s crazy if you don t have the newer xbox you gotta wait till april to play
i just want good games im tired of being an 80  alpha tester
i wasn t interested in this game  but if it s going to piss off the cultists  then i m 100  going to play it. i may even make a twitch channel just to live stream this game. never bend the knee to the cult ists
pretty simple make an awesome game people will buy it and you will make alot of money.
we hear every new successful game  changing the industry  and yet the industry stays the same. now what will change the industry is the fall of live service games thats happening. gamers have realized as a whole that live service is a short term money grab.
damn  melonie just shat on every playstation exclusive title of recent year lmao
i agree and i am proud to be gamer
i am telling you  there are people secretly buying and playing this game  even if they are outwardly saying they won t.
more edgy games please i m trying beat elden ring i also like games like halo mass effect infamous devil may cry i m gonna play hogwarts legacy when i can get the game i love video games don t know why i typed this much
the only problem with the game apart from some performance issues is that they made a troon barmaid in the three broomsticks. basically it s a  woman  with a deep manly voice  and it s like aren t they supposed to have magic powers  why don t they magic themselves a more feminine voice  it doesn t make sense  and this is what happens when you pander to freaks and basket cases.
i would settle for devs not putting anymore identity politics in the character creation section like they did for  hogwart s legacy .
i m a big time  ist   and a proud  phobe ! i have fun with it!
i think difficulty settings are overlooked too much.  i see nothing wrong with a super easy mode or an ultra-hard mode.  ideally  doing easy should be practice for harder difficulties.  they could even split the difficulty sliders into puzzles  combat  and minigames.
indeed  people that actually buy the products will eventually win out. all companies that don t understand that are going to lose money  that is just factually true. gamers buy games and twitter personalities do not buy as many games as gamers do.
i bought it and i m enjoying it thoroughly  it s a good game.. profesor garlick is hot af!!
this is why japanese entertainment are high in quality..... they re not politically motivated
non gamer activist  you can t play this game or we cancel you!gamers  fuck you you can t tell me what to do!non gamer activist  suprised pikachu face.
the problem is that the game is still woke af. the industry just managed to break the woke broke conundrum they ve struggled with. they took a minimal step backwards on the woke. not saying hogwarts isn t fun  i m just saying it s obviously still a ludicrous high jacking of anglo-saxon modern folk lore
did anyone else notice how quickly forwarned playstation exclusive was replaced by hogwarts legacy playstation exclusive forwarned   woke. hogwarts legacy   opposite. playstation was out of that asap.
i don t like difficulty modes in games  there should be a standard difficulty and it needs to be a challenge for most games. difficulty modes just give enemies more health or stronger attacks  it s cheap. a game s challenge should be in its overall design  and adding varying difficulties limits that. let gamers be gamers again  noobs can keep up or get out
@melonie mac go boom  me and my brother talked about this before.literally all easy  normal  and hard do is change values.it s unnecessary. don t even get me started on  story mode  difficulty
@melonie mac go boom some difficulty modes do more and use to do more you know its not always gonna be more health or worst weapons.
@melonie mac go boom  noobs can keep up or get out not every gamer who prefers easier modes is a noob either.just because i do not care to die five thousand times and wait through long ass loading screens in something like witcher 3 or dark souls doesn t mean crap about me lol.
i want to note 3 of the best games  imo.final fantasy 7  american version   resident evil 2  not the remake   and silent hill.visually all three are bad given today s standards but the story and game mechanics were are still good. it took me over a year to beat ff7  almost the same amount for the other two. i didn t care about the extra endings or other things that were rewards for beating them but the many hours of enjoyment and challenge that came from them.i do like the tomb raider reboot but i agree  it s not as challenging as older games.i m past 14 hours in hl now and still in fall.
i don t know jack schitt about harry potter. but i m liking this game!
yes  i bought it to spite them. i stayed cause it was a good game.
i do gotta say naughty dog games are not easy. they can be  but the last of us is very difficult on the higher difficulties. i kinda agree about the new tomb raiders in general. honestly i thought the gameplay was the redeeming factor. the story and writing was cringe and convuluted though.
i have lost 7  friends  i have known since high school.. but they removed me from all socials.. and funny thing is i dont care... just for playing a game there pathetic... clearly not friends if there going to judge me for my choice of gaming....im so lost by the twitter twits i think people who live on twitter are detached from reality
it s not a perfect game by any means. it still is quite immersive. i do like that the developmers are not allowing the sjw crowd to affect their work. they wouldn t address any of it on their twitch stream and quickly deleted any comments. they put 5 years of dev time into this. they re not gonna have all their work thrown away because of butt hurt people.
i think it s funny you talk about elden ring as a counter example to games becoming more and more accessible.  elden ring is a joke compared with demon souls and dark souls.  you can go loot the world  kill all the easy bosses and out-level the challenge in the hard bosses.  could you do that in dark souls   to some degree  but it was a lot more restricted not being an open world game.
ah i see now  i need to use the portal to move the platform to the other side of the bridge shuttup shuttup shuttup shuttup!!!!!!!
i feel like everyone is finally done with the  for modern audiences  bs and the ubisoft open world hud stuff and we re finally speaking up i really hope tears of the kingdom starts opening soms eyes
those tweet numbers are wild!
i ll be happy when i get my new pc lost previous in flood  and can actually play. laptop is so old it can barely handle.
games got easy so people like frosk could play. no matter what the devs name the modes  they re the same  takeyourmeds  recentlydivorced  casual  normie  and gamesjournopro modes.
tomb raider iii was pretty hard. angel of darkness also  but for the wrong reasons
i seriously hope it s a wakeup call for game developers. if you want your game to sell like hotcakes  just make a game the woke crowd will hate and retro fans will love. i mean  don t piss off the woke on purpose by making it obnoxiously in the other direction  but let s be real it doesn t take much to piss them off. this shows that they re completely powerless and a 180 of how the general public feels.
pander to gamers who actually play video games  - this isn t an approved message. we ll be needing you to walk this back.
3 30 you can t really compare a single player game to multi player games  hogwarts will peak and die off as players thrash the game and move on where as multi player games have consistent players  if good enough  for long periods of time. there is no comparison.
this game has been the best example showing that the people who whine on twitter are not the people playing the game. so there is no point catering to their fake outrage.
i love this game
cyberpunk 2077 had some pretty woke elements and still turned out to be a great game story wise and gameplay despite it s buggy ass launch. if cdpr actually learned how to put money into just the game alone and not marketing the game would no doubt be a success.
this game is my new no. 1  before witcher 3 and resident evil 4 and gta sa vc.
best three opinion wise because i would ve figured zelda be in there if it was statistics wise.
ubisoft is still making games and generic sandboxes are still around so i don t see how everyone is done with those games they still make money.its almost as weird as saying everyone is done with generic boring fpssor overly cinematic narratives with linear to no gameplay.
@chandller burse  the fact that their games aren t selling that well anymore and that they have to cancel a few games is indication enough in my opinion that things aren t going like they used to
@chandller burse  there s also now the thing with all those live service games getting cancelled which includes a few from ubisoft
@theub  i thought they never sold that well.i just want an assassins creed like 4 again or a fun dumb game like wd2.they can even set in sf again i loved it there pride flags or not its better than dark cyberpunk ugly london.
the bugs for the most part were just funny  i didn t crash once on release patch  and only couldn t complete 1 quest.but the gameplay is honestly rather bland. on my first playthrough i went with mantis blades and pistols...and even compared to that i regret replaying it with hacking  that s just really boring.
i got a suggestion for you  you should make a community poll to see how many of your subscribers chose the good or evil path. i m curious h ow many goody 2 shoes are out there! lol
pure wisdom.
i preordered it three times
great video mac! please keep up the great work. will you have a christian video channel
gaming started to go down when  corporate gets involved.
also  chaotic hufflepuff  is not a phrase i thought i d hear today. i m a resourceful ravenclaw even if it means exploiting the occasional side quest to do it. i do love that the npc characters remember the outcomes of your decisions and hold you too them
like i dont like hp at all but this game is fun and enjoyble.... i start to understand why people love hp the game is amazing
get rid of the trenders! they ruin everything they touch.
while it is nice to see the woke mob fall flat on their face trying to cancel the game  i would be remiss if i didn t offer a warning  game devs might be using astroturfed cancel campaigns as a means to sell games in the future given how well hogwart s has sold  so please be aware of that going forward
i watched a game play video of hl and i might get it now.
i ve done both in mass effect  did one paragon playthrew  and one renegade kinda wish we could do something like in hwl maybe in the next one
my girlfriend use to be a huge tomb raider fan as a kid teen and she s been replaying those games. i sometimes watch and realized those games where hard as balls! i remember them being harder then games today but even by the ps1 days standards they re way harder. also made me miss those kind of games  wish they still made those
genocide simulator ....yesss.
completely wrong idea. some people just like a good story and cutscenes with gameplay. elden ring is a good game  but personally for me it have the worst quest system although it s the best of all of their games . there should be variety of game types. sometimes you want a challenge  sometimes you want a good story game  like tloups. playing since 90-s. favorite game - gothic 1  2. still think that it has the best quest system
i m not sure i was a gaming nerd.  maybe.  i started playing computer games on a 64k ram apple   e while i was a nuclear power plant operator on a us navy fast attack submarine in 1983.  you would not believe the fuss when the first 2d gta game was released.l
i don t think so in the slightest.if anything i bet they ll just keep on as they have been and double down using the  reviewers refusing to review  as justification on how they need to  do better and push harder as it s obvious things are worse than they thought! .sony and ea still exist after all.deadspace proved you can push and change things and not get called out or burnt for it.god of war shows you can make people buy a terribly boring and droll genre and still push for things and people will happily slop it up.all this did was reaffirm what most gamers already knew about journalists  they re salty they re reviewing games rather than pushing for narratives elsewhere .i d say if anything it caused an epiphany for some in the  community  a  are we the badguys  moment.maybe i ll be wrong. wouldn t be the first time but i m a natural skeptic.i just see this as a flash in the pan that will be historically retroactively twisted in the years to come for justification.or  if anything a reinvigorated pursuit by  journalists  and these companies to to write more articles or force a more critical eye on and about hiring practices to keep the  bigots  out of development.
its not a genocide simulator    dont know about that  ive been genociding a hell of a lot of spiders goblins and dark wizards all week!
gta memory... running over a family of hillbillies with a wheat thrasher ... fun memories ... i refuse to play hogwarts legacy because the game looks like meth and i need to work.
recently dug up a copy of tomb raider underworld for ps2 in a drawer of my brothers old games. i ve never played any tomb raider before but i recently got pcsx2 emulator and have been playing it. i can see why you enjoy the series  its very thought provoking and difficult and forces you to explore and really use your head to get through certain stages which leaves you with a great sense of achievement when you finally crack it. unlike modern games where you stand still for 5 seconds and the character is throwing hints at you and it just leaves you unfulfilled. even yesterdays stream at one point you kept telling ima to be quiet and i could see exactly why. especially playing hard mode  it would be nice if they could cut the hints and not try to baby you through the puzzling sections!
make a game just to make a great game it s sad that this is groundbreaking stuff nowadays
ooh good idea!
oh you ain t seen nothing  underworld is playskool compared to the classics haha!
i hate puzzles. give me difficult combat and or challenging gameplay mechanics other than overt puzzles. lol.
tides are starting to turn  the game is literally woke as fck.
the player count even went as high as 807k.not bad
well said  make games  games again!
yo is it just me or is the woke crowd more upset about hogwarts than they were about roe v wade
my copy should be here next week.
hl proves that it doesn t matter what twitter weirdos think if a game is good it ll sell and speaking as a sociopathic ravenclaw who bullies students and genocides goblins this game is good
a major part of why its doing well is the massive popularity of the hp universe among normie gamers that know nothing about jk rowling s alleged opinions or culture wars. they just want to play a game in hogwarts. it shows how insigificant the woke movement really is. in entertainment at least
i am one of the those players who is playing it rn im only level 8 at the moment but i am enjoying the game
unpopular opinion but i spent a few hours in elden ring and it was too damn hard. i didnt care for it. i reached a point where it was ridiculous to move forward without getting basically one hitted. i didnt know what to do to progress further. i tried hard to progress and couldnt get close to being able to do so.. did i need to farm trash mobs for more xp or something  idk. the story also seemed very non existent. also if i m going to play a game thats only straight combat  its going to be a first person shooter.. with the exception of the classic matrix games. those were fun. super mario is another exception lol.
melonie hogwarts legacy reminds me of fable thoughts
first we were the rejects  then it became cool  now they re trying to make it woke.
i think it all started around mass effect. a huge portion of the bioware fans are a right bunch of sad creeps who made it all about which alien they wanted to sleep with. that s when i think the stunted horde hijacked gaming.
if harry potter is what breaks the woke s back in going to laugh my ass off
there is no substitute for a good game.  watering it down for more people might be fine  but if you turn away from your market  that is a long term loss.
i would get a refund because the game is tagged as a genocide simulator and i don t get to genocide anyone xd
hogwarts legacy is as woke as it can be   it has the 1st trans character in harry potter universe
is she going to play yugioh crossduel  it s more than half the size of yugioh master duel
at this point i think i have played less of this than the blue-haired freaks...mainly because i have a job
wonder if ea will look at this and think   maybe anthem is worth it   because that game could have been great  rip.
those characters are just victims of poorly done polymorph curses.
i want mass effect 4 from bioware not anthem 2.
you re such a cool person melonie.  god bless you.you re right about gamers i was a nerdy gamer growing up i can relate.
i don t believe the pendulum is swinging. the normal sane people are still losing the culture fight it s jus  the game of harry potter hogwarts is too appealing to pass up because of the lack of harry potter type ip s. so the next game that comes out with backlash against it that is made inside of a convoluted genre will not make it out alive
of all the stupid review and article the one that really hilarious for me are that article where they pick the part from how player can use the 3 unforgivable cursesand they like  how dare this game let player use killing curse!!  or  playing this game turn u into wizard murderer!!! like...uuhhh seriously    how they think  a player should beat their enemy in game  by shouting them and canceling them
vidoe games don t create monsters. but some monsters do play video games.you should have to ask for hints on hard mode.the  t  bartender is hilarious.
i pre.order it for the ps4 and the nintendo switch i  have not a ps5how it looks on this two i don t know i hope it looks good
resident evil 4 remake will hopefully remind devs how s a game done right for good
as someone who s always been made fun of for playing video games like  a child  i feel like i ve always been a reject of society  and could care less that people are gonna try to  scare  me into not playing!
this is whats i am saying let us game
only been playing for a few hours  but i haven t felt this immersed in a game in a long time  and i don t even care for harry potter much.
good video.
miss when games were fun. they had juvenile humor and games try to be games not these cinematic soapboxes that think they were the most intelligent pieces of art.
you re so right. i m really worried about the  easy mode  for the upcoming street fighter 6 and tekken 8.fighting games used to take work in learning characters. and you were rewarded with victory over others in versus and online play. the games used to be so great you wanted to get good.now  companies want to cater to casual gamers by dumbing down controls and strategies in order to attract new players. it s a great concept on paper. what ends up happening  though  is such an idea alienates the core fans while casual players may stop and look for a bit  but soon they are on to the next big thing.what happens then is the game and series suffer and they don t find any medium or long term support.just look at the dead or alive series! doa 6 dumbed down the  sex appeal  which was what made the doa series stand out. so much work went into making doa 6 a good game  but it was a failure sales wise because it alienated fans. the sex appeal for dead or alive  as a series  was racy  but never lewd. the core fans were put off and the casual gamers never even gave it a chance. why did tecmo koei make this decision  to appease the wokesters and  get into the tournament scene. it just didn t work for almost everyone. this is always the case when developers publishers want to appeal to the masses. this industry favors the bold. make a quality game  screw the politics and handholding easy modes and damn the consequences!
is this the biggest successful licensed gamed
elden ring and hogwarts legacy the past 2 years have given me a lot of confidence that games are indeed returning to being games. this year alone in game releases is off the charts. we still have jedi survivor  diablo iv  re4 remake  final fantasy xvi  and starfield just to name a few. all of which are going to smash records on live streaming platforms and most likely receive high praise. a great year for gamers and streamers.
anybody looking forward to starfiled
is the game changing the industry .... i think the real question has to be how much is this changing the gaming industry. i m sure this is going to be showing management that actually wants to make money that they need to focus on producing good narrative content and a fun experience. then we have the activist element of the industry that wants to produce nothing short of propaganda. naughty dog is a great example of a once good studio that s been tainted and corrupted. despite anything they may say  they ve proven that they can t be trusted. they will gaslight and lie to the public to try and produce sales for propaganda even if they re trying to front load the sales as pre orders and day 1 sales. that would have worked with tlou2 if it hadn t been for the leaks. if it wasn t for the leaks that would have been a successful bait and switch that they would have ran off with all the money.now this is where we get into the real rub... entities like ea are the real problem in the industry. they don t actually care what they produce so much as how much they can squeeze the customers for especially over time. this has clearly came at the expense of the product as we ve seen time and again  but it doesn t necessarily rule out producing titles that are actually rooted in proper product development. the problem at that point is that we can fully expect them to cut content and or try to sell it to us as dlc add on stuff like fancier robes  more hair styles hats  and other additional p2w elements in this case.ultimately  i don t think this game is going to drastically change the industry landscape. sure companies that want to make actual money will likely back seat the activists now that they re seeing how much money they re leaving on the tables  but i m sure they re going to insert said content into the game but to a less egregious degree.
i agree that activists should leave games alone and that gameplay should be improved and innovative.  howeve  what s wrong with making  games accessible to everyone  isn t that what different difficulty levels are for  so that those who want a more difficult game can have their preferred experiences and those who want easier can have that to  i m an aging woman who enjoys games  but just don t have the reflexes that i had when i was a younger person. opening up games to more people can help dispel the myths that gaming is somehow a negative things.
hufflepuff represent!
honestly  in a game about magic  i m fine with trans characters existing.  the problem most of us have isn t that they re trans  it s that they think they are but aren t.  reality exists.  in the potterverse  and many other deep fantasy worlds  it s not at all difficult to believe that you can literally choose to be another gender  say a few words  wave your little stick  and make it happen.  people in the real world do some pretty weird stuff.  i can t lie and say i wouldn t try spending a week or so as a woman if i could out of curiosity  especially if the process were so easily reversible.  the difference is that here in reality  magic doesn t exist  which means that there isn t a cheat code you can enter and swap.
hufflepuff fo  life.
and outside of ff16 i bet you any money those will all have massive problems on pc because they forgot how to code for pc.
@evacody124  optimization can be really tricky for pc because you can t really do a blanket code like you can for consoles. everyone has a different set up and they usually only optimize for the highest end gear which most people don t have.
i had no thought of buying hogwarts legacy until the shit fest the rainbow people started spewing out  i am literally watching the download bar on steam right now. i even got the digital special pack so rowling can get some more of my money.
just wish there wasn t any wokeness in the game. at all. bring the gaming from like 10 years ago or 15 even back. but still overall it did alright and i still want to play this one. hope it s good. also yes  hard games feel great to play and win. edgy is best.
i don t play any games that s been touched by crystal dynamics. everything else is free game.
has her character learned the crucio curse yet or is she skipping those
i don t do twitch  are you ever going to post a cut of your stream on youtube
hogwarts legacy is a talking simulator a good amount of the time  its kinda boring once you get passed initial hype imo ... generic npc talking sumilation is worse then highly produce cut scenes.
i m a 40 something year old gamer. been gaming since the last days of atari and the birth of the nes to now. and what those people just don t know nor realize is that when gamers join force and come together  we are truly a force to be reckoned with. gamers on game on!
bring back game over s!!3 lives or bust!!
the woke cult can throw their buzzwords at us all day long. we ve been through mw2 lobbies  we can handle it...
i m having fun with the game
people will play a game as long as it s well made and doesn t waver to the woke mob.
i don t think this is edgy.   i think anything that upsets woke dumpster people is going to be good on a thematic basis.
gamers want fun first over everything. it s why this is succeeding over the failure that was saints row. games should be made for gamers. not for non gamers.

the activists are digging their own grave  because money talks.
i find it funny that people always find ways to judge and criticize others for what they do or do not do. sooner or later  someone bring religion into it. the way i see it is that if i am going to be judged then it will be god that does it no one else. if people have a problem with that then that is your option and  in the end  we all have to face our maker and come to grips with the consequences of our actions.
maybe the north american industry  the one i abandoned a long time ago  doom aside from id. i ve been stuck with classic and modern japanese games and global indies focused on gameplay. i m playing both resident evil 2 remake and castlevania requiem  specifically 1993 turbo grafx-16 cd akumaj  dracula x chi no rondo castlevania rondo of blood. castlevania requiem classic collector s edition was the last thing i got from limited run games  rondo of blood was only in japan in 1993 on turbo grafx-16 cd or correctly the pc engine in japan. thr og 1993 turbo grafx-16 pc engine akumaj  dracula x chi no rondo on disc is at least  250 and it s hard to find a working turbo grafx-16 pc engine. analogue is releasing the duo  region free turbo grafx-16   pc engine known as turbo grafx-16 duo in north america. that said  i have it on ps4 and i love it. my biggest excitement this year is metroid prime hd remaster  legend of zelda tears of the kingdom and hollow knight silksong.
the trans name is sirona. ona means she. sir she.
another funny thing  even though jk rowling is against transgender  you can very much make a transgender character in the game.
im going to be myself and if that offends anyone. tough s  t! i dont care because thats their issue not mine  i hope more people will follow my example.
10 years ago bioshock an anti obejectivism arguably anti capitalist game existed so
@chandller burse  there s older stuff that slipped it in to desensitize people i know. most didn t do that but some did. same with movies. that said  as popular as bioshock was i actually never played it
@chandller burse  it has to start somewhere. they slowly introduce it over time as they desensitize people to it. at first  it can sometimes be hard to notice. there s some movies and games even older than that i seen do the same. but as i said  most didn t and overall the quality of games and movies were much better. wish we all caught on sooner when they did slip it in  like with bioshock. that one i just didn t play tho. not even sure why... just didn t get around to it.
yes  i upload my stream vods on youtube at youtube.com meloniemac
cool thanks! i was half interested in trying the game but i want to see it first.game devs lost my trust years ago. i miss liking surprises. but one can only receive so many turds on sticks.
the sirona character  the laughably  diverse  demographics of the school in 1800s british isles  everyone using the  they  pronoun for your character  and the fact that you can t even have a white skintone in the game lighter than olive... doesn t really make the game the woke-slaying badass you seem to be portraying it as. the game is woke af while being attacked by the woke for not being woke enough. the best outcome would be for it to fail  honestly.
nailed it melonie!
game is at 700k  as of this morning...
i hope these wackos saw the success of bill clinton  elden ring  and the light bulb finally came on for them. we need games to go back to the way they used to be like the soulsborne games. this makes me wanna play hogwarts legacy now.
once for ps5  then xbox  and now pc
i am so upset about this game not having representation for me! all of the playable characters seem to be young  svelt  and not unattractive! why can t i see myself in the character i create  why can t i be a 300lb fifty-something pasty white guy! ! ! ! i m soo oppressed by this game!
dorian is gay in dragon age  i thought he was realistic and i even helped him reconcile with his father before his death  i didn t have a problem with sorana or whatever in hogwarts legacy the character reminded me of alchemy in eso when you looking for a high elf missing brother  convinced alchemy to tell the sister the truth neither character was shoved down my throat they came off as people with personality and feelings not a over hyped sexual preference.
i also heard some of my co-workers stumbled into your videos...
it s not. you still gonna have a slew of woke content in gaming. no matter how much it sells or doesn t sell. the industry will keep towing the line on this until society as a whole sees the woke agenda for what it is.
jkr hater  u no buy terf game! reeeeeeeee!!!!avalanche  avra kedavra!  zap!  game notification  avalanche has unlocked spell  accio money by defeating jkr hater.
oh boy i sure love puzzles where i just press x
no. jk rowling is as woke as ever  the difference is the gaming industry is using her to gather audience and she s using the audience to not be totally slaughtered by the monster that she helped create  wokeists.even for clickbait  giving power to these people is nonsense... it s the audience that always has the final saying. just let s hope people don t start thinking  jk is conservative  or  devs are based  just because of all that.
have you seen wireds review of the game
good job kid. this makes me wonder if my money spent on sonic frontiers could have been spent on a better game  but i love that blue hedgehog
gamers are great    may i introduce you to the souls community..edit  this is only a joke. there s bad apples in every crowd
i don t think gen z understands that millennials were made fun of for playing video games in the 90s and early 2000s.
aaaand there s ppl like me  see  in eu we have zero pressure from any activists  my cousin is transgender and nobody cares   he  have perfect life and that s that. now  i never liked harry potter  watched first movie and it was boring for me  and i know plenty of people feeling same. as rpg fan  i gave it a try  but no  didn t appeal to me at all. everyone have different taste when comes to games. and that s perfectly okay. same as the last of us  some hard-core fans of the first part hated second part and vice versa. last thing  little advice  more you talk about some group  you are actually helping them  giving them boost like those ppl  groups  movements matters. they don t  just ignore them.
the leftards tried spoiling the game  but little did they know i already predicted the ending.
they re all slytherins so even the loudest ones hating on it are still playing it behind closed doors i guarantee it. they re bs and blowing smoke doesn t equate to losing money. good games make money. appeasement is irrelevant.
the word transphobe and biggit have also lost all meaning.  gamergate  rip wired ign kotaku polygon
that was to be expected besides the skin tone not being lighter than olive. i expected it to be woke but i doesn t seem like it s failing anything soon
what makes her as woke as ever
sonic fandom.resident evil fandom when you encounter the groups that fight over how bad or good the modern games are compared to re1 to 4. a few others i am sure lol
does it really matter now  all trends use to obscure and even disliked.games were persecuted by conservative news networks in the 2000s now most of them couldn t be bothered to do a story on a game.
@chandller burse  i m not mad lol  it s just interesting to me. also yeah  i remember when jack thompson called gta a murder simulator  lmao.
hogwarts legacy so far is the most inclusive game ever. there s people of every race  gender and sexuality represented. you can make a trans character if you want. we got a middle eastern man  an african woman  an indian woman and a trans woman. we got blondes  brunettes and gingers with freckles. we probably have furries too  in the form of werewolves  dunno  didn t get that far in yet . we got old people  young people  lots and lots of cats  altho where are my dogs  i m a dog person damnit!  and birds. you gotta be mad if you say this game is an istaphobe game.
the ideal game would have bothgreat gameplay and compelling story
team hufflepuff
what s really funny to me about this whole hogwarts  legacy drama is that the game is sooooo damn woke. did you know hogwarts is more ethnically diverse in the 1890s than it is in then 1990s  if the damn woke idiots would just let themselves see past  jk rowling bad   they d love the stupid thing.
so much this. people would accept them across the board if they quit shoving it in our faces and if they quit coming after children. they re destroying themselves.
about the rainbow flag characters  i am ok as long as the game make it optionl  like dragon age or fire emblem. i am not ok when you have no choice. i do not care about you being able to make your character trans  that is ok because it is optional. when i play a game i want to shut out the world  not to go get a bear and out of the blue  welcome to they them lbtqmentaldisorder bar  what can i get you  . at least let me kill that character and make them hire someone else.
gameplay is the most important thing. not graphics  not story  not cutscenes. gameplay. it s what you re gonna be doing and if what you re doing is bad or boring  it doesn t matter how good your game looks or how good your story is. the callisto protocol is a perfect example. game looked good  but the gameplay was terrible.
hogwarts legacy 779 416 all-time peak 3 minutes ago.......
i hate saying it  because i m all for making the game enjoyable for everyone. but i still feel like they ve overdone the diversity quota as per usual. end of the day  hogwarts is in scotland and it s meant to be like what  1890  you can say   it s a magical world  etc.  but we know from the lore  it s still earth and linked to the  real  muggle world. and we know from the main hp story that they have magic schools elsewhere. so it doesn t really make sense. and the lack of different english accents is disappointing for me  or even welsh and irish . it seems like 90  of them have posh british accents. but most brits don t sound like that. i know americans others struggle with some british accents  but it has subtitles ffs.there s a bunch of other little things  but that s the stuff that stood out the most as a british person myself.either way  it s still a decent game from what i ve experienced and hopefully it s just the gateway to making an online hogwarts game in the future. i mean can you imagine putting together quidditch teams and duelling people  etc  so many side stuff would keep you playing  regardless of a main story.
this also proves that single player games do also sell well are you listening greedy game publishers in the gaming industry
it is sad to see so many people suckered into buying a game that normalizes alphabet behavior.
game is good  great even. i just wish there was a path like good or evil. how say mass effect does it. and they had a field for quidditch. sure they could have added a quest or two or minigame to play whenever. however... thats what sequels are for.i m maybe on mission 4  doing the beast broom stuff. level 28 haha
how bout asking kids to play this game instead of forcing to go to  family friendly  drag queen shows!!! sounds good to me
any1 know if melonie is back to streaming this game since the night it glitched  and melonie if you see this  what was ur favorite tomb raider game
gamers are still a different breed in my experience anyway.
honestly i think the drama around this game made for a great publicity and probably even drove the numbers up. the woke ideology is already dying and its so great to witness!
i find this to be a little too hyperbolic  i hope harry potter enjoyers are actually having a good time with it  the game itself in my opinion is a run of the mill aaa but that s not really the point  the point is that it s sort of disingenous to say that hogwarts is pushing forward a  product first  politics dead last  approach because the developers clearly folded with the random trans character in the game  you know for a fact it was added because of the overwhelming online backlash when the game was first announced  so just forced into it that it s insulting for anyone who believes in the lifestyle. at the end of the day what we have seen is money talks which has been a standard practice in video games for a long time. i m not entirely sure it s right to say that the 500 million player count are all playing because they want to support the push for art forms to be free to express  it s more that harry potter is a gigantic brand and this game proved that the brand can still hold attention after 2 decades of recent gaps in products. this reminds me of the star wars game shadows of the empire  it was a game specifically made for market research on star wars interest as a brand because it was before the prequels were announced.we will still see young game designers who have strong left leaning view points getting infront of game direction and pushing agendas into the medium because the establishment is fine with it  it makes money from the younger crowd and at the end of the day video games still have their biggest consistent audience with children.  it s gonna take an industry crash to see it flip back where creativity is more important because companies that own all these big ips just want profit and they don t care what the audience thinks.
for me it doesn t even launch  and i m not the only one who has this problem. seriously  this is ffff annoying.go to the steam discussions if you don t believe me.
honestly though..legacy is a fairly  woke game  there s a trans character  all the characters are 90  non-white  women do everything competent and the men in this game are either evil or stupid.but as far as i can tell  none of the characters in game are grooming anyone  so it s not terrible. no child drag shows so far.
thanks!
thank you so much!
the twitter weirdos screaming their self-righteous indignation into the wind were either 1  never going to buy the game anyways because they re not harry potter fans  2  weren t going to buy the game because they can t afford the  60 after their cat food meal prep  or 3  were access media goons who receive free early review copies anyways. none of these were ever going to be sales to begin with and therefore their virtue-signaling claims of  boycotting  the game simply do not equal lost sales. they lost. big time.
elden ring is good  but game of the year  i don t think so  or maybe yeah  there weren t any challengers on 2022  and i agree to some extent with you that devs should focus on gameplay more than last years  but at the same time as the story telling  and for me elden rings lacks completely of that  compared to a great games and one s of the best of all time like the witcher 3 or red dead redemption 2 that focus from gameplay  to story  to free open world from the beginning  elden ring is not even close.
over 800k peak on saturday
i hope it does  but i have a feeling they ll be more double-downing before things will change. we need more wins against woke games.
i am getting tired of live service games like game like this. currently playing at low-medium settings.
hell yeah.that s exactly what i keep saying just do you and  cancel culture   will eat itself away.
it s success is not just thanks to  owning the libs  it s the fact that the developers respect the source material and put heart and soul into the game!
we are gamers. . .
ironically this might be good for trans people in the long run as activists might realise that the aggressive approach doesn t work. they are better making a positive case for their cause than all this harassing people.
gaming was taken over by people who failed in hollywood.
people act like this is a win against  the woke  even though the game is entirely filled with  post-modern  tropes.trans characters  openly gay characters  characters complaining about  ablism   and diversity   multi-culturalism worshiping is everywhere.
not to be a hater and i m glad the woke crowd are getting shown up  but seriously if this game was not a harry potter game no one would care about it from what i ve seen of the gameplay it just looks uninspired with spells that don t amount to much but shooting particle effects at everything  so not sure where the elden ring comparisons are coming from.
at the time of this vid it is now 790k
i think you re focusing on the wrong thing  we ve had graphic adventures and easy games for ages  even before og tomb raider. difficulty settings exist for a reason  and there s always challenges in multiplayer games  what really matters is that no one gets to tell you what to play or what can be made. and if you re gonna talk about cut scenes and non-inventive gameplay don t point at japan as a positive  they re kings at both those things. lol
preach!
idk if hogwarts is the game to use as an example of tides turning really. i m playing on hard and it s kinda easy  unless there is shit ton of enemies at once . and i didn t get a chance to be evil yet. not a single time... i could ve been dick to some students but that s about it   the game is woke.i do enjoy the game but i m not sure if it s exactly a champion of a change in the industry  d
i m glad hogwarts legacy is doing great and love gamers sticking it to the boycotters but i still don t get where melonie gets this whole  games are cinematic cutscenes now  narrative from when that couldn t be further from the truth. the most popular games that have the biggest player counts are all multiplayer games. the real argument should be that all games are the same now  battle royales.
you stuck  don t worry about figuring it out. just push this button and we ll do it for you! no skill needed.
we started with postal.now refusing to boycott a game  containing married lesbians and a trans-barmaid  for being too transphobic is considered  edgy .how the mighty have fallen.
i had my comment deleted by youtube for saying  d1vers3   lol. my point was hogawrd s legacy is a typical watered down modern western rpg. if you ve played one  you ve played them all. then again  i m coming to this game after 500 h in elden ring.
elden ring is the best game we ve had in more than just last year. if you want a story watch a movie  video games should be video games again. the majority of the story should be told through gameplay. all these overly cinematic games are for the common denominator casuals
@melonie mac go boom  yeah  as i said before  the past years devs have been focusing too much on story and too little of gameplay  so at least for me  and as for all in life  balance is the key. happy weekend.
everything about the game is politically correct.
amazing! i filmed this yesterday since i am with family this weekend  happy to see it is doing even better!
games as a whole are dramatically easier than snes and ps1 era for example  it is quite drastic. some exceptions do not change the rule.
@melonie mac go boom  not if you factor in multiplayer games  which are much more common these days. and graphic adventures were a whole genre  not just some exceptions. plus hogwarts isn t exactly hard  and it was never sold as a  gamer s game .
there s been a good amount of games that seem like they are mostly cutscenes than gameplay and some videos have been made on it.
@yu lee  there s definitely a handful for sure but melonie makes it seem that s all there is and she keeps saying it s highjacked by people who want cinematic experiences i still don t get how that s possible when games like call of duty  fortnite  apex legends  csgo and the like are the most popular if anything there the ones that have highjacked gaming and they re all pretty much the same  battle royales. melonie is cool and all but sometimes i think she just makes stuff out of thin air like how she mentioned that gamers are more of the rejects in society but that s completely false  gaming is more popular than ever! another thing is she makes it sound like hogwarts legacy is so fresh and brand new like it s never been done before. don t get me wrong hogwarts legacy is a super fun game but it s very formulaic and nothing new so that tells me she actually doesn t play a lot of games which makes sense because of why she thinks every game is cinematic.
i love the optimism but the  trans mafia  still has more power than ever.
i really what to see that gaming ppl make games for people that play games insted of a small vocal minority on twitter that will not buy their game even if they had money  but they do not because they are broke commies. still games is a part of escapism. i do not what to see any politics in it  i do not what to see this mambo jambo hokus pokus  we added a character that is from the lgtvakfgnldkfnladkfnhlknhsdknghslhn  community  that feels really forced. i just what a good game  i what a game i can just forget about time in. i have not felt that for a long time  but this game was alright and im thinking of doing 100  in that game. i have not done that in a game sense the early 2000s. also the gamereactor was like why does other gaming news going ape shit over a game  like boycotts over what jkr thinks. kind of silly if you ask me kind of stick.
games are dumbed down and vehicle for predatory profit strategiesmake interesting challenging games and price it for what it is  and gamers will buy itthere s alot of us that aren t fooled but the crap of the recent game industry trends
you know what  you guys are much braver than i thought.  i saw last of us episode 5 and mentioned that i was bored almost at the end  that i wasn t really paying attention to it anymore and that i thought it would get better.  no... that s not what you are supposed to say.it s too much for my mental health  so while you guys fight for what you think is right  just be sure to take care of your mental health.
amen!
i hope gaming gets edgy again like it was in the early 2000s.
i just wish this mess would finally convince these companies that these woke nutcases arent the true clientele!!! another game i also want it to be truly successful is hi-fi rush! great game made for one thing  a fun game!! not a political joke  no dlc  no season pass  just a good game!
but blame sony too because they themselves are pushing that agenda. they want games to be an interactive animated movie. less gameplay more talking cutscenes.
the one trans character in the hogwarts game isn t there to be a trans character.they just happened to be a person who is trans but also has run this tavern for the last 50 years they have their own personality and backstory their personality isn t trans
play hi-fi rush mel
we need to make games great again.
funny thing  i don t like the harry potter universe  the books are horrible and poorly written  but this game is fantastic.
i just got the game just cuz i heard all the woke ppl hating on it  but it s actually a great game
i can t believe you said this game doesn t shove woke culture down your throat. it s like you re ignoring all your own criticisms with movies and tv currently released. the game is fun and i m into the story  but when they make the tutorial animation a black chick for a game set in 1899 in england you know they are forcing a message down your throat. not even mentioning all the lore breaking dialogue they give natty in the beginning of the game. the game is fun and other than the lore breaking stuff i don t care about who they add just stick to the world. but for you to criticize  all those other things  rings of power  mcu  velma  ect.  yet seem to ignore them in this game is kinda lame
oh how the turned tables
i still have a problem with gay and trans characters in game. the game plays in the 19th century and this was not a thing in this time. i do not have a problem when there is one gay character in a game if it fits to the story. but gay ghosts  but today  they only put them in in an over representive way to please the woke zeitgeist. but trans is not a sexual orientation but a identity disorder and i have a problem with it in a game shown to me as kind of normal thing and lecturing me about the problems these people have by fitting into social norms. also  that sex is not a determination in character creation shows the woke ideology influencing gaming and young players.
as you said  the game has trans characters and gay characters  and just like in real life  it doesn t matter unless you re trying to date them.  nobody in real life parades around telling everyone they meet about their bedroom activities or what they have in their pants.  all these  woke  people would find themselves less hated if they weren t constantly trying to get attention and force the issue all the time.
melonie for president
love to support a game that removes sex gender for inclusivity  take that   woke-left
facts
don t worry  they don t have much to be damaged.
it s a sad world indeed if  edgy  now means  based on a story written by someone who openly espouses to believe biology is a concept that exists .
great game! let the leftist tears flow!
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
it s why i abandoned north american games  doom 2016 and eternal were pure gameplay  little cutscenes. that review someone made about metroid dread was very telling  complaining it s way too difficult  she just wanted to experience the story. um  metroid dread barely has what this woman would call a story  it isn t last of us. metroid has always been pure gameplay. let s not forget the loser david jaffe and his crying about a metroid mechanic since the nes famicom in 1986. he wanted the game to tell him to shoot blocks to advance. in metroid if your stuck  you shoot and lay bombs everywhere  you ll find the path. no surprise the original developer of the super easy god of war  2005  series. poor thang.
.................................there s that s sweater again....oh melonie. ravenclaw all the way.
i really think that christians should involve themselves more in gaming.it would be a good way to spread the good word of jesus christ.
gaming was never conquered by socjus like comics and movies or tv. gamergate was a war they lost and never mounted a successful assault ever since   other than a few games and details here or there.
i want this game to beat elden ring   but i think they will be hard
i agree that its fine to have woke elements so long as its world and story first and they fit into the world.
i m not friendly. i ve been a gamer since the game boy color.
i don t get the praise here  the game is not a rebellious or revolutionary one in the culture war.  i ve played 30 hours of this game now  according to steam  and there are no pronouns  my pc is addressed as they  them  and their instead of he or him   there s an openly trans npc  and there s an openly homesexual npc that is married.  how is this game pushing back on activism  or am i not playing the same hogwarts legacy   oh  because there s not  flags plastered all over hogwarts .  sorry melonie  but i disagree with you here that this game is doing something different.
i had to fight  defend myself for my hobby and i meant that literally i grew up in downtown phoenix arizona. same with anime you would get picked on hard if you liked it openly.
dumb down gaming  where every little jonny and soccer mom can be a pro where we would help you cheat
after i finished the story mode for fallout 2 i travelled around the game killing every npc to see what would happen  the answer a lot of dead npcs but nothing else and this is from somebody who as issues playing an absolutely evil sith in swtor .the same goes for civilization games  i played civ 1 on the amiga in 1992 and i ve played every version  i only ever go for the conquest victory for steam achievements an to see the  ending cut scene   i usually got for science victory or added the cultural victory since they added it as an option.
so much hairspray... holy
this game is doing well because it s a good harry potter game  that s it. it s nothing more. the gameplay in this game is nothing to get excited about  it s the same ole open world icon check list stuff that ubi soft constantly throws at all. it s not the second coming  it does nothing new at all. i wouldn t say at all that this game is indicative of people wanting more gameplay in their games since it s just basically farcry hogwarts
i spent the whole day  breakfast to bedtime  playing hogwarts legacy yesterday. enjoyable harmless childish fun. it has plenty of  representation  that is sometimes wrong for the lore  but that does not detract from the fun. certainly not a  phobic game created by  ists and  isms.
a beautiful and smart girl who s talking common sense  subbed.
i m sorry  but i believe gaming was better when it wasn t mainstream. when nerds were picked on  it was better. sorry for saying that but it s true
at least the good part is the gamers always get the last laugh.
i don t really consider that woke.if it s done for the sake of twitter social credits then it s woke. if not then it s just artistic liberty
also hufflepuff ftw
thank you so much!
i agree!
gaming hasn t stopped being edgy in my friend group. we have gays and all and no one cries when a  f slur  is dropped or bust eachother balls because it s words at the end of the day. we are all like 25  though so we aren t part of the soft ass zoomers. people would have a meltdown if they were in our discord chats while gaming. language aside though  gaming is so easy these days for the most part. only games that have difficulty are really fromsoft games.
the fact they put a trans character in a child s game is absolutely disgusting and dangerous  and this game should have been boycotted by parents and moral people alike. if you disagree  please articulate a reason why the trans agenda should be being marketed to young  impressionable children.
don t these idiots know to shut up when there s a big red button involved     telling a gamer not to buy  play or stream a certain game is like telling someone  don t push the red button! ...  we re gonna push that button with a sinister grin on our faces after to being repeatedly told not to!
elden ring was so good i couldn t finish i was so close to throwing my controller but i still  enjoyed it and in hogwarts legecy i plan to become evil i am nice in real life
nice thought  but the game is still woke.
easy test to gauge whether games are easier...when was the last time you missed a jump in a aaa title
personally  i think the best of all worlds would be difficulty sliders ala old school doom  and then a model toggle. that way everyone can play a game on the difficulty they can handle and have all the butts and boobs that they want. hence why i love mods  my cultured brethren never disappoint on making better models than anything bethesda ever made.
yeah man screw their activism! i m so against activisim i don t even know when earth day is yeaaaah!!
i still remember seeing games like the the quarry get released and i watched someone play it and  and thought to myself this is not gaming anymore  whats going on  i actually had people tell me it was good  and i would roll my eyes and say  ok . but idk why anybody would want to play a video game where your not even really doing anything. that s something they should be keeping in movie theaters. but seems like were getting back to the way everything was before that trash got released.
difficulty options is answer same as always god of war jedi fallen order no one complained. streamers want harder games coz they make money off every stream cause it their job i work 80 hours a week i want to enjoy a game not struggle on one boss for a month imo
tomb raider legend trilogy was as good as the older games. they started the story telling around angel of darkness. the legend trilogy was a return to form.
thats whats up
not all at changing anything. this game is pretty much a reskin of assassin s creed... but it runs like garbage for an unreal 4 engine game.having played 30 hours of it i can say that 100  it s just assassin s creed. it s a fun game but for me after 10 hours it s so repetitive. you get so little spells it s depressing. it s a game based around magic and you only get like 16 combat spells... 3 less if you don t use the dark arts ones. the combat is fun but again it gets super repetitive. endgame after level 30 if you got the right talents and stuff added to your gear it becomes too easy. you can 1-3 shot just about everything with normal spells and the same with ancient magic.then the exploration is just copy pasted content everywhere with nothing really new and it gets old. it s the same stuff they did with every assassin s creed. then you got the story... it s just member berries to trick people into thinking it s something grand. remember the blacks ! we talk about them! member those weasley people !!! we got one! remember old quotes from the movies  we rehash those! i give this game a 6 10 for not really being new and pretending it s not just assassin s creed with a reskin.
i sure hope so... make women sexy in games again.
the thing about harry potter is yes its witches and wizards but it has nothing to do with satanic stuff. they celebrate xmas every year. thats one reason i appreciate the ip.
sadly the same is still happening with se and final fantasy they change the gameplay for  modern audiences  and this games have become a button smasher fest with high graphics. sadly dragon quest is next my expectations for xii are extremely low. they already have the mana series and they refuse to develop a new mana tittle.
they did sneak in a lesbian old lady and a  trans  character  but they are so minor that feels like a joke
you do such a good job at pinpointing  the problem with modern western aaa studios. a lot of their games have little to no appeal to me but  prior to subscribing to your channel  i haven t really been able to articulate why. it really is an issue of having great stories and beautiful locations  but not having the gameplay to back it up.one great thing about elden ring is that it is an open world game that actually justifies being an open world game. by this  i mean that there is a reason to do things outside the main quest line  and those things involve fun gameplay rather than simplistic mini games. from the west  we ve gotten games like red dead redemption 2  which derives almost all of its strength from its story and the visual appeal of the world it is set in. i didn t like it nearly as much as other people did because the story alone isn t enough to make up for other things. the game didn t have any reason to be an open world game  because  outside of missions  activities were limited to things like playing poker  hunting  exploring the wilderness  etc. these things are fun to do irl  but doing them in a video game isn t. they are too simplistic from a gameplay standpoint. it doesn t help that these activities didn t provide any in-game benefit. the missions were much better but still suffered from the fact that gameplay was always limited to taking cover and shooting with an arsenal that couldn t change much over the course of the game. ultimately  it felt mediocre to me  and really put me off open world games until elden ring came along.
nintendo games still extremely difficult
hog warts still falls victim to catering to the lowest common denominator. i get it somewhat  as this game will also have a decent portion of children playing  but it s still ridiculously easy - and i m playing on hard mode
hopefully companies stop listening to fake game journalists and adult children or those who hate fun and art and start making games more for entertainment or if they do have some message it s not added at the expense of quality fundon t shy away from tough games that people have to put effort into least for that type of game more adult related subjects and content for games targetting older audiences weather it s high violence  fanservice sex etc and ignore the prudish and immature adults who can t stand such things don t be lazy with the overall quality both in how it runs and looks even if takes longer to release if going to have a character creation system i would like it if they improved quality like i ve noticed a number of games tend to make the base male body and reuse it for the female as well  or limited options if going to have it try and make them good if it s like some i would prefer just having a good default character male or female character option then poor character creation

i think you are underplaying how many of the people who bought hl are not gamers and mostly bought the game because it is harry potter. the game being good certainly helped solidify sales but the ip having such a huge global fan base due to rowling work is the bigger factor here
are we talking about the record for the most snowflakes melted
you know what the person that says video games are for kids has for a hobby  sitting on a barstool drinking until he passes out on a tuesday night because his life sucks ....... yep that s a quality adult hobby to have.
it has been a very good lesson for everybody that they are in the minority and everyday people are over that s    and just want to play the game.the boat crowd is a very small minority of people that yell very loudly and scare everyone into thinking they re the only one that disagrees making them bad
its at 780k rn on steam
wait you were homeschooled until  bro wth the same and i m the only child
hip hip ho ray!!!!!!!!
lol hogwarts is no different
melonie  you should cover wired s  review  on hogwart s legacy  its not even a review. just a rant fest from someone who hates jk rowling.
you re saying a lot of nice things but the fact this person is a literal speaking tumblr post is so grating i lost my eyebrows. i hope you all have a wonderful day.
13 35 who cares about religion when it comes to the choices you make in life  especially gaming
i would play hogswart  just to make the satanic woke mad..   i would love it.   but i can t.
make gaming sexy again. puritan trends drive me nuts!
they should pls go away and try to hijack amarican football
hogwarts did it right  see for me my brain sucks and i know im not the only one just more vocal than moste in my situation  but my brain is mushy i am not great at everything. but im smart enuph to try and try again and hogwarts has a difficulty system as destiny 2 and vahalla and somthing about all three of these titles work for all types and society has treated me ill many years and finally gaming gives me an outlet i need. enuph is enuph i need my outlet you need to harden yourself as we the gamers that have been hear longer no offence lgbtq and woke but look if you need this outlet you have to aid us not the other way you have to change we wer hear first you blend in not the other way around and we will treat you fairly. you messed with the harry potter fans nice try not ganna happen.
love you
yeah i agree and the points she s making about the game kinda proves my suspicions that she actually doesn t play a whole lot of games because although this game is fun it s definitely nothing ground breaking or anything new. the only difference is that this game has a harry potter skin other than that it s just an open world game with a lot of open world elements we ve seen before.
japanese games for the most part have remained on course. but even that s slowly changing with bigger studios like square enix  capcom  and konami.
nothing wrong with causal stuff to we have kids and other hobbies in life to i don t mind quick pick up game and i m sorry tomb raider was never a good game    to me anyway each their own
some game have a bad story and bad gameplay on top of that ask money for the game but i think you can play a beautiful game with good story good gameplay and great animation. that is call god of war games. there is bad example of this idea and there is good example of that idea. for me i hate battle royal games like fortnite why  simple they put little money to the game to get billions and people keep playing those games that is why game companies dont care to create a good aaa game they can get more money doing bad gamelook see this a good aaa game make a round millions 1 or 2 months and maybe a billion on 1 month but a bad game like fortnite can make  2 739 726 in a day. why they going to create a good game i hope this change but i dont see it.  hogwarts legacy is a good game
hi melonie
i wish pok mon would focus less on pretty cutscenes . and not have the tutorials last over have the game  like just let me figure stuff out
let s take gaming back from the wokes! libs just got pwned!

maybe we need to make this game game of the year
you re a steelers fan
youll be warmer if you put your hoody all the way on
gaming helps my mental health and if they wer kind they would know that it can help them aswell that yes gamers care about fairness we know what its like life sucks we know but we evolved and learned and as ive learned you cant take shortcuts  have to help yourself not change the world around you make yourself adapt by also ofcourse be yourself ofcourse if you example gay you have rights to be no problem anyone who says you cant be needs to back off but im not going to take your side on everything political and bend a knee to you  your not a king or queen your a person we are equals in that way its time to learn.
the creators still left a trans character in the game and called my male character they theirs. i was rather disappointed with the pronoum. politics in game is f   ed up
massive white pill
100  agree on all of it.
there are 786 322 concurrent players right now
nothing was more cringe than insomniac s blm mural in miles morales
um changing the gaming industry   maybe for console. but it s another poor pc game i want to play it. but it has issues and it s not my job to do fixes to not have fps drops. i m sick of triple a game companies doing this to games that also go to the pc. it needs to stop. they make these games on a pc and can t get it right.
pretty pathetic these same people wanted gow to win goty  like wtf that just a walking movie simulator where you throw an axe a few times  and zero replayability where elden ring you can do thousands of different builds.
most actual gamers don t want their hand held. they like a challenge and elden ring s success is a testament to that. make a good game focused on gameplay and being actually entertaining and it will sell. also nobody wants that woke nonsense in their games  so keep that shit to yourselves.
i wonder when melonie mac will have her antisemitic arc.we ve all seen how she thought wearing blackface at a comic con would be funny  during a 3 hour stream with nina griftinity  so it s not long until she s sieg heiling and saying zyklon-b was nothing but a delousing agent.
i agree on the  hard mode  not being true to what it should be. i had to go through the options to turn off all the hand holder sht like mini map   quest markers  little golden trails to show you exactly where to go . i did notice some notifications are mixed with hints and updates on like  you looted 45 gold  off off off ffs !!just do that sht for me when i choose  hard mode  also give me permadeath option.
facts. elden ring is such a great game. but i want them to make dark souls 4
i tried playing dark souls  but those games i found really bad. i like hard games  but that just feels like intentionally wasting the time of the player. and with how bad from soft is at coding  i just consider it unplayable  with the technical issues  and the lack of proper keyboard and mouse support.
probably not
i bought the game because it s good.  owning the woke is just a plus.  would have bought the game to piss the woke if it was bad    nope.
now give us back our beautiful busty women and stop downgrading them.
wired magazine ranked it 1 out of 10  and called it antisemitic.the journalist is a woman who reviews sex technology  and lives with her partner in portland  oregon  so...
hogwarts legacy is no elden ring   it s not even close
this game is sold out everywhere....
all these crybabies moaning about  buying the game supports genoicde   i  guarantee  buy bottled water which companies like nestl  say access to water isn t a right.  so where s the cries for boycotts over that
oh no
you got  hufflepuff cool the sorting hat gave me raven claw
they helped the game with their transphobic bs. now people are buying it out of spite.
very edgy for hogwarts to include a trans character
not really. i want games to be darker and more sexualized again like they were back in the 90 s   00 s. it won t change as long as the woke soytalitarians have their grip on the western gaming industry. the hogwarts developers are woke  trust me.
and cheating hacking what ever you want to call it the fake pros
i just dont agree with your arguments about difficulty in games.
i really like your view on this but i feel like it s a little too optimistic. i think harry potter as a franchise is just more popular than the woke shit
i remember when normies started infecting and inserting themselves into our hobby. it was when cod 4 modern warfare  halo 3  and gta 4 came out.
13 58 no no no. i am never stopping making fun of people who bought pokemon scarlet and violet. ever
lol. tomb raider was hard because the control where terrible. people who say games are easy are those with 20 years of gaming experience. just like a hold 30 year beating a new pokemon game and complaining it s too easy.the n64 stick was terrible for platformer but the modern analogue sticks make the same game 100  easier.
when people have gayness stuck in their faces constantly  they become sick of gayness and don t want to see it anywhere.   so excessive activism is counterproductive.
not just gaming they have tried to mainstream a lot of think that was nerdy and geeky. star wars  doctor who  lord of the rings.
lol portland oregon tells you everything
i don t get how it s antisemetic. people are like  oh the goblins are jewish stereotypes  - well maybe that s their problem for thinking that way  i ve never equated the goblins with jewish people or jewish stereotypes in the decades that i ve been a potter fan. has rowling ever said that they were supposed to represent jews  or is it just the trans mafia trying to get more people on their side by asserting more crap
it definitely took some inspiration from souls born imo
really gamers are great and give u what s on their back  gamers are great to women they re simps. to everyone else they are the worst people i ve ever dealt with in games. i m a gamer but i really don t like most gamers they are the worst. they need to leave the basement sometimes.
i will have you know that i am the underhanded evil. a nice happy neutral evil. simple.  looks at honeydukes  ew candy!  runs at candy store.
trans love harry potter because they already believe in magic words.  i identify as....  then poof!  they re whatever they say they are!
game makers appeasing the 1  trans community and offend the 99  regular people how is that a good business model go woke go broke
don t worry the woke definitely won t survive the nuclear holocaust so cheers
the irony of this game is that creators made a transgender character
hogwarts legacy is woke and directly panders to activists groups  such as the trans community .the game is full of diversity hires  many of the villains are white males and there is a  first ever  trans character  who is featured in the game.they are also a required npc in the begining of the game  cutscenes and all   so anyone claiming that this isnt and activist game is  clearly lying stop spreading this lie that hogwarts is  making games great    is for the fans  and  is fighting woke culture  -- in no way is any of this true...the lgbtq community is boycotting hl because they hate jkr  who is a far-left  anti-male  anti-white feminist   not because the game actually offends them.hl was specifically designed to pander to the trans community  again  hogwarts legacy is specifically designed to pander to left-wing activists groups  such as the lgbtq.it is nothing short of infuriating to watch so-called  anti-woke  channels like this one and g g disingenuously promote this game like it is some paragon of integrity.if you enjoy the game  that is totally fine  however  do not lie and pretend that it is not woke.this is a woke game  made for woke idiots that are too stupid to realize that they are protesting their own interests.
this game still is woke trash  though.
too bad its not a good game
you should care there are gay characters in games. god forbids man on man and woman on woman relationship.
where snoop dog is good fake gaming your only as good to how much you pay
over 1 2 a millions transphobic bigots. kinda makes you proud. playing through on xsx currantly. even though i also bought it on steam and ps5  just to trigger the freaks. expensive month after throwing in the psvr2.
yeah  gamers are taking gaming back by supporting a shitty ubisoft-like game full of diversity from a studio that fired a developer for being pro-gamergate a few years ago.
youre hang up on  game  and  walking simulator  is kinda off putting. tlou a walking sim  are you serious
the game is woke garbage still.
wow has you help not one  not two  but three gay couples  but no straight couples.  one  ok.  two  sigh  ok.  three   give me a break.  are gays that feeble they need so much help
seriously melonie  this game is not what you are claiming  it still has a trans character in it. rowling had nothing to do with the game. this is not a giant change. thumbs down.
i wish somebody would do something that s actually edgy for a change.  all the people trying are failing so hard that it hurts my very soul.  it s like watching a bunch of rank amateurs.  i can and have come up with better edge literally in my sleep.  watching the grammy s attempt at edge was just so weak it was cringe instead.  also your hair looks fantastic  d
i am antiwoke person but this game is overrated as hell...on high end pc its almost unplayable for me and game itself is mediocre at best...its popular only because of hp license and controversy around it
change the gaming industry  it s not gta or anything. it s a great game tho. not industry changing.
lol it s name is sirona. ona means she. so sir she
i dont think so  hogwards legacy is woke af. dont get gaslit into simping for woke games.
no it s not. play the game for yourself
