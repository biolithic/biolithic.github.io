I went through this phase before too and God took me back  I hope your heart is softened and you can come back to the Lord as well. satan has you exactly where he wants you right now  and by thinking you are serving nobody  you are serving him

@melonie mac go boomÂ  I am serving my family  loved ones  fellow americans  and country all together. the way I came to my conclusion was most likely different than you did once. my brother constantly eggs me to come back to it  but I fear thats impossible. Ive seen what Ive seen and its impossible to unsee it.I do appreciate your concern though. Christians are certainly one of the kinder groups  or are most of the time at least.

I actually think your dedication to your faith is adorable.
