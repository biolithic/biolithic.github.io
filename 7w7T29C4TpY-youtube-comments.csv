glad she stuck to her guns  didn t compromise her values and eric brought her aboard. that s so awesome!
eric july seems like an awesome dude  and kara lynne seems like a wonderful lady. awesome that he was able to bring her on. rippaverse is gonna be epic
young rippa is going to completely destroy the modern day comic book industry. which is why they are failing. lol
we are proud to have her on our team! she was not only cancelled unreasonably but she is also very competent and already making waves in our company!
rippaverse s stock has increased throughout last year  so it s cool to see his brand expand. congrats to kara.
i saw on twitter the other day she got a new job  didn t know it was rippa that hired her. good on him and good for her. he s a good dude and is just getting started with the rippaverse comics and she s getting in on the ground floor. best of luck to all of them
i remember this story. i m glad eric picked up kara. she s going to be incredible. as for limited run games  i can t understand why they listened to one person who has been known to cause so much trouble. purple tinker is a miserable human being
together we all rise whether working  praying  hiring  social media  whatever part you play! thanks for the video!
love seeing that she s working for the rippaverse. i ve been praying for her a lot lately
this is a serious win against woke culture  we won this battle but the war is far from over. keep up the good work. we will see more and more victories in the near future.
bless you melonie. you re a good woman. still praying for you and your situation.
stand up against evil and good things will happen. love that we have such amazing people in the gaming community. love the video as usual  i hope we make a rough day that much better for you the way you do.
i m very happy for kara and for eric! god s doing a lot of great things through them. great video melonie! you look amazing today too!
love the support  what a great community
it s great to see eric  put his money where his mouth is . kara didn t deserve what happened to her  and eric stepped up and did something about it. i wish nothing but success for them both.
i love that kara has found a good place to work  i watched an interview she did and she seems like such a caring and dedicated person. eric is going to absolutely destroy  big comics  haha. seeing this solid push back in the nerd world is so great.
this is a very kind message to kara lynn. you are a very good friend melonie
great news! thanks for keeping up on this. it s so good to hear good news.
this is really cool. it really seems like like the rippaverse is giving the people what they want and doing it in a manner that is good for their business. successful comics business  and yes i do mean business  no wonder social media is upset with them.
love this. sent her a welcome as soon as eric announced her onboarding on yt.i saw her chatting with you a few weeks back and i was bummed that she was being screwed over.knowing that this woman is another one of the good folk joining the quality team of eric july s rippaverse  baby!glad to have good peeps on board
true
we can all be so strong  she s a very respectable person for that.
i think people should sue  if they can  cause its descrimination.
rippaverse is gonna be huge. they may cause a shift in comics to go back to telling compelling stories and not push an agenda
hope he ll hire the people from the big two who are fans of his  but have to keep their like of him to themselves to avoid discrimination.
i hope he coming out with a movie soon
i wish i could buy stock in rippaverse.
whassup  viperchief
@falcon_by_the_lake  not much dude been working on making upgrades to my living space mostly. lol
or rather  he s saving the comic industry by bringing back real comics
@the screaming celt  next best thing is to buy a signed copy of his comics. will probably be worth a lot in a few decades when he monopolizes the industry.
they have stock  !
i mean  after hogwarts legacy  you d think companies would ve realized that it doesn t matter. ignoring them has zero impact to sales.
@toshineon  not to mention  giving in to their demands only results in losing the core audience. i  for one  am never buying a limited run games game ever again. they ve shown me who they are.
i vowed not to buy anything from limited troon games
according to kara  they were all scared and capitulated to the woke mob. she says she doesn t hold ill will against limited run games  but it s clear to everyone they made the wrong decision here.
thank you so much  god bless!
looks those have been heard
god opens one door after one closes to show that god cares for his diligent children
thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  any time.
@melonie mac go boom   ur the textbook definition of trophy wife.
thank you andrew
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
when rippa did the interview with her  i was really hoping this would be the case
kara is a very welcome addition to our team  and we re glad to see the love and hype around it!thanks for covering this  mel! the lord bless you more!on a side note  there was no crowdfund for the rippaverse  xd.
such great news for her  well deserved  better opportunity to not worry about her being about to be a free thinker and not worry that because of it she could lose her job  well played rippaverse
i liked how classy kara was during that whole thing and she certainly deserves to find a landing pad with a good company.
this makes me genuinely happy.  i love eric and everything he s doing and him getting this lovely lady to work with him is the best!  eat it  easy run!
so many hearts . super happy for her and ripaverse.
this is for the best  i hope things get better for her and rippaverse
awesome news to hear!  glad to see rippaverse growing even stronger!
in so many ways eric july really is doing god s work. what an absolute legend  i can t wait for rippaverse to become huge and for many others to be inspired to create similar companies.
big kudos to rippa and so excited and happy for kara lynne!  here s hoping they both thrive and keep making fans happy!
kara is awesome i love her random adventures in conan with the gang. so happy to hear she joined the rippaverse im qearing my isom t-shirt today in celebration

i remember watching eric s interview with her and i actually expected him to offer her a job. glad to see it happened! cancel this!

a lovely addition to our family! welcome  kara!
the news warms the heart.  humanity should be helping each other  not stepping on each other to get ahead.  oh and i think it s pronounced  van sky-ver.  keep on keepin on melonie  d
hey melonie! great to see the news about kara lynne.loving your hair today. have a wonderful day
i love seeing good things come to good people.
so happy for kara.
great news!  also  love the studio style lighting setup.  keep up the good work bro
was thrilled when i heard she was going to work for eric july and the rippaverse.  talk about an upgrade!
just when i said that this girl should have an opportunity at rippaverse.try to tell me this isn t god opening one door after the other closes.
eric is awesome i hope great things for him and his company
melonie kara lynne deserves to work for eric she did not deserve to get fired from limited run games
good to see another conservative channel we have to stick together you got another follower.
good for kara. she gets to be in an industry with flexibility and a company who cares about their fanbase.
good for her!! i first heard about this girl s ordeal from blaire white s channel. she was pissed about it  too.
there is still some good in the world! thank you for the amazing news.
thanks for sharing this great news!
nice to hear that. good job melonie
i just want to say that kara lynne has just landed in a great job position with rippaverse bc i think that she will be at a great place to work and she will not have any problems with her new job than she had at her old job last year and couple years ago  ok melonie. anyway i m so happy for kara lynne and what she did to get a new job with rippaverse. anyway i just wanted to make a comment about your video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great day and have a great evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. god bless you and your hard work that you do to make these great videos for everyone to watch and make a comment on them too. anyway have a great day melonie.
big win for her! love to see it!
i used to be into comics   used to wanna draw comics but wokusts ruined every character that i liked   was inspired by so i abandoned comics pretty much.much happier with music   monster mask making but hey it s good to see that comics aren t completely dead   that there s still new companies being founded hopefully it sticks around.cheers
eric july is showing the comic book industry how its done. good for kara  she can only go up in the rippaverse!
eric july is a great hard-working guy i have 4 copies of isom and other rippaverse items i look forward to his next book. i enjoy your gaming streams on twitch because you do play by play its good for kids to see. i work in a middle school as a head custodian and have twenty students in an after-school judo club. i have been getting carnivore videos popping up today a chicken soup for weight loss and other keto recipes come on after.  you are the butter stick babe. thank you.
thanks for letting us know about a happy ending for kara lynne. nerd since i was little. praying that your issues go away smoothly.
glad she landed on her feet. limited run gaming lost my business forever
glad to hear this  really encouraging!!!
good for her. saw the interview eric july had with her as it happened.
i saw a show with nina infinity and kara  and i think that kara is so cool and funny  she s all good vibes!!!
this just makes me respect eric july even more.
rock on kara  keep on keeping on!
i hope your  problem  gets resolved soon and satisfactory. it s an unneeded burden on you. stay strong. remember to drink water. everyone have a wonderful day.
she did not deserve to get sacked for something she said on social media  if she did it on lrg actual account i might understand but it was her personal account from what 8 years ago
rippa is serious about this parallel economy!  love to see it!
to god be the glory. she s going to be amazing working with rippa  aka erik july
melonie... hi  thanks for all you do and your channel...   great news for rippa and kara...i wish them both the best of everything.the two of them truly deserve it...and so do you...   and most of all...melonie mac...thanks for being you...   melonie i hope you will get to play conan exiles with nina infinity. jayne theory. xray girl. and kara... as soon as possible.it would be so cool...but will you create your fighter to look like you or will you create her to look like lara croft.just think you or lara croft with a sword and magic... can t wait...!!!
lol that s great. i hope when i get a comic from rippa  it s gonna be kara that communicates that i m gonna get my comic soon. ah ha happy for her.
unfortunately we all know how much the so called  open minded people  will try to stop the rippaverse from growing  but i really wish it becomes a big thing in the future
well  when the comic industry just throws money on the table because of ideology and politics  it only makes sense that someone like rippa who s got a head on his shoulders would provide what comic buyers want and take that money. he deserves the success he s getting and the experienced employees he s now acquiring.
rippaverse is gonna be a beast in the future!  a legit team!
would like to see you on ethan s van sciver s show sometime. everyone over there always speaks highly of you.
that s amazing. thank you for the update.
young rippa is a good dude i wished him success on twitter
true nerds are not loved by the mainstream  never truly have been.
thats amazing! everyone needs to support rippaverse
what an unexpected but accepted surprise!
my first episode of your show i viewed  thanks for the good news
good on you eric july . good videos mel
wishing you all of the best!
i m very happy for her
the fellowship of based nerds ... i like that!
young rippa out here killing shit. bro and his team bout take over everything
omg she is joining the rippaverse!
a small correction he didn t crowd fund his comic  it was a preorder campaign.
what a fantastic success story
hey pretty melonie so it seems someone got a happy  news so good for her.
and i found you based off of watching rippaverse. i will officially subscribe now even though i have been watching for weeks
a new beginning for her  good to see.
love to see it. thanks for the update.
i hope rippa comes out with a superhero movie soon   directed by that guy did john wick
eric is the man  good for them both. f limited.
eric d. july is an absolute legend.
eric july is da man!! glad he gave her a job. he did mention that years down the road video games based on his comics may happen. this may be the 1st step!!
sad  the gaming industry wasn t like that years ago. i worked for two gaming companies back in the day. back in  the day  gamers weren t all nerds   they weren t woke  it didn t matter or really   it never came up what political affiliation you were. then again  im gen x so. sad to see the future being created by these two generations of youth. love the channel and your content.
definitely read isom  if y all haven t already! love the writing style!
let s go rippaverse!
all i can say is  sick burn. sorry the 90s won t leave me alone.
the meek shall inherit the earth  we cannot be stopped
the geek shall inherit the earth. good on rippa.
some of us in the comments section have been talking melonie  and we have all concluded that we would like to see you sing a duet with your cat at the end of each video. we think it would be unique and interesting.
yes this is great news
this is so good to see  i know we like to not wish negativity on bad people but i honestly do hope companies like limited run games go bankrupt and their higher ups all end up drowning in debt  it s the only way this woke bs will stop
this news just made my day awesome
when wokeness ends and all these people abandon it like every other previous thing they  cared about   we really should force them to look into the eyes of every single person they harmed for the sake of virtue signaling. just stare at them until they feel the shame they truly deserve.
it definitely was a limited run for limited run.
when one door closes  a better one opens.
comics and games and everything else in entertainment are hardly trivial. far from it - culture creation is one of the most important things in the world and things like comics and games are a huge part of it. think of where young people form a huge part of their identity and outlook and values outside of the family - one such place is entertainment products. so creating good new products like the rippaverse isn t just fun and neat  it s mission critical.
all for one  and one for all!  youngrippa59  nerdom  musketeers

i think it s always wrong to take over and rewrite someone elses foundation  no matter where it is
are you thinking of joining the content creator conan server with az and kara
welcome to the fellowship  kara.
eric july was always adamant that it be known he didn t crowdfund his comic. it was a preorder campaign. the comic was already a finished product.
new subscriber and a conservative-veteran-gamer lol- christian...awesome news!
as dj khaled would say  congratulations you played yourself
thank goodness.game on kara . hogwarts legacy goty.
i m so excited for isom 2
people don t just want  good stories   you are sugarcoating the hell out of the real thing consumers want  conservative  wholesome content.
eric july   restores balance   the internet liked that
glad to hear she landed on her feet. not a fan of the new blue lighting in your room  though. don t get me wrong  you still look amazing  but it seems to wash some of the warmth out of your complexion. i am slightly color deficient though  so maybe it is just the way my brain perceives the information.
a little off topic for this video but i always hear creators complaining about people getting unsubscribed by youtube and thought that they were just paranoid about their subs. i guess it s not a myth because it happened to me for this channel.
her name is kara lynn gooch. melonie mac looks like an elf from everquest.
3 20 ish -- yea  babyfy  is a good phrase. was just at a panel for best video game soundtrack of all time and one person submitted last of us 2 and another person forspoken and i m like  are you cereal!   who is choosing forspoken over final fantasy series for best music or last of us 2 over legend of zelda  persona  donkey kong country  cuphead   this is infecting every aspect from gameplay to creative music
imagine being purple tinker  lol
their stupidity is eric s gain.
i really don t understand how this kind of thing ends up in the gaming community. i actually  follow spwan wave and all of those guys  and they don t once bring up any political stuff. infact playeressence was avoiding talking about it last night in his stream. but i think if we ignore them they will stop eventually.
protip  in the end  satan loses. bet on the winner.
so much of the comic book industry has recently focused on stupid political messages. thats why i can t collect that many of these newer modern issues. i don t want to store house any of that woke crap in my collection. it s good to see she found a better place!
@biolithic the first game did have a good soundtrack.
ignoring people for the past few decades is how we got where we are now
@waystedyou  ahh i doubt it. i think we paid too much attention to them. only know this  because i m a gamer and we ignore things  and we don t talk about politics or news. we only look at gaming news. give it it a try and see what i mean  and then you will understand.
hail to the rippa!
im not trying to take anything away from this accomplishment but i would like to offer some practical advicei knew a girl who used to work at bethesda games  her salary was around  45kshe was a senior game dev or something like thati eventually saw her at a company i was contracting with for a time i asked her why  she told me she got almost more than double doing web design or ui design and it was basically the same thing just with less deadlines and easier workso to come full circle  most of the issues with game companies is that they have become so large that they are essentially bloat that stops creativity  all for the rights of working for  bethesda i cant say anything about the new company in the video you did i dont play new games because they are lamehowever  one of the biggest issues in tech is the questions of  should we allow skilled workers in for computers stuff  and i think yes  to a point  but at the same time why are competent people in the usa spending all day dev ops for games but contracting out the security systems to people in pakistan and sri lanka just food for thought
hail rippaverse
the time of big companies making big money is over. it s all about indie developers now.
eric should hire gina corrano next
could you please  talk about the restrict act  this bill has the ability to ban any thing that the gover doesnt approve of and they would fined you if you use vpn.you read that right  they fined you if you use vpn.
so why can t the games just add an  easy mode  for people who just want to kinda sorta interact with the game  and regular gamers could play the games  seems like it would make most people happy.
forecast for the rippaverse -- to the moon!
it kills me that this is even necessary   nobody should worry about their employment for expressing political views.
rippa has a good eye
it s sad that showing compassion and support for an outcast is now counterculture and it makes me so happy to see people getting more comfortable with pushing back against the locust crybullies.
i was a participant in comics gate.  believe me when i say evs is cancel culture.  just because someone isn t politically correct doesn t mean they re on our side.  evs is the prime example of this.
patience is a virtue this is gonna burn themlater
what sucks is she was fired for the mere idea that she might be conservative and that s even worse fuck limited run games. i m delighted she was able to bounce back after getting screwed over and no better place for her than at rippaverse.
great news !!
limited run games is a sinking ship anyway. rippaverse is a far more promising venture  because eric july is an entrepreneur of unquestionable character.
i think eventually eric will outright buy dc from wb. no way disney would sell marvel.
good for kara!
eric rules.
you and eric should do a collab soon.  and with razorfist
how
absolutely love you too .. speak your shit
if pt thought he could fire her from the rippaverse then he should think again because i don t think rippa isn t going to listen to that pathedic excuse of a brony freak
good news
with the tranifesto of the nashville shooter out  how violent will the they thems become
i have the first publication by rippaverse. haha. it will be gold one day.
purple tinker is a hedonist  he gets people fired to suffer for his extreme pleasure  because that is the trans-movement  where it is about selfish  anarchist hedonism.  the sons of disobedience have a problem  pleasure and pain are intertwined in the human brain  this isn t intellectual  it is biological   and to have pleasure you need pain  as they define each other.  in hollywood and computer games  as an example  this is done by the struggles and sacrifices of superheroes  where they face down supervillains and monsters  where the problem and trouble is created by the writers  and then the writers gives a situation where superhero solves it  and then your brain gets a hit of dopamine  of feel good brain chemicals.  in the star trek franchise  captain picard and captain kirk are full of win  after they face down the trouble for armchair astronauts.  this is why comedy exists  because tragedies are downers  they don t have good rewards  where a comedy is a tragedy with a happy ending.  the famous dr. sigmund freud said it is eros  pleasure  and thanatos  death   and these things are part of human biology.  so  for the cult of hedonism to function  someone needs maximum pain for the maximum pleasure  and this is why we see narcissistic people  because they are purposely manipulating events to experience the pleasure  this creates inappropriate behavior  exploitation  and manipulation.  in the problem for the sons of disobedience  this is all inside the brain  they take a penalty within themselves  we can see their sad  lonely  anxiety-ridden  fearful  paranoid  troubled lives for embracing the flesh as their god. the flesh is the worst god you can choose  because feelings are not facts  the feelings comes from the secret biology of the brain  nobody can know themselves and make smart decisions over un-provable feelings.  moreover  to force the pleasures for the dopamine  of feel good brain chemicals  creates an addiction  and they cannot enjoy normal things  the adult entertainment industry witnesses this. look at wonder woman  she really takes down the enemy  in the animated features  ruthless  brutal  painful  superhero battles  and then she is a beautiful woman in the pleasure.  you get it all right there.  our culture has been indoctrinated into this  and we see shameless hollywood produce hedonism outcomes everywhere.  the thing is  wonder woman should be enough  for people like the purple tinker  he has to serve his dopamine need  that is more than most people  and this creates his narcissism.  everybody do yourself a favor  put away the adult entertainment content  and get back to reality.
yay melonie !
5 04 i ve also been told my spirit animal is a badger. however  i m an american badger  not a honey badger
