I love that you always have a quote from the Bible thats relevant to the topics you talk about. even if I dont necessarily consider myself Christian  although I do still believe in God   its great to see how the truth and value within these scriptures that have been around for many millennia still hold up.

when I started to follow you it was because you were into videogames which is something that I am really into. I was surprised to hear that you go to church and doing Bible verses on your channel. I used to go to church but itseemed like my age group didn t go to church. I would find people too old to kids or anybody close to my age were married. I ended up leaving the church for that and for other reasons. I think its cool that you still go and happy for you. kind of wish I could do the same...
