the babylon bee being censored was the catalyst.  all they had to do was give their account back.  but something good came out of it.  elon musk is the hero we need and the villain that big tech deserves
new york post  trump encouraged elon musk to buy twitter. elon musk  no  Ive never talked to trump. he said he s staying on truth social. this is msm journalism in a nutshell  anything for clicks.
with regards to promiscuity  I think its really the major thing behind the whole abortion thing thats going on right now. people keep using excuses or a minority of cases that result from rape and incest as reasons we need abortion  but the  need  for abortion would be nearly non-existent without promiscuity. its the number one cause of this really horrible thing we keep doing  as well as all of the other problems its caused. like you said  its a bfd.
1. encouragement is not a crime.  2. elon is his own man.
melanie    I wanted to see if they actually pulled these.... ideas out their butts....            yes   they do.
great vod  mel! I believe your interpretation of that verse is spot on.
love this verse of the day really weighty. melonie I completely agree with your interpretation of this verse. God often comes down hard when talking about sex because of what it can do to us when it is done before being in the confines of a marriage. and just because we dont feel the negative effects immediately doesnt mean that there are none. God s not trying to limit our fun but protect us from things we dont fully understand or choose not to understand. God created sex he knows how to maximize our pleasure while keeping us protected for the abuse of it.
every time melonie brings up dating  I feel like Im being teased! dont toy with me melonie!
a friend of my wife has been on the dating grind since her husband died 10 years ago and is very discouraged by hookup culture. she says dating now is like showing up at the gate for a baseball game only to find out its already the 9th inning. do you go in anyway so you get something out of it or just miss another game  she would agree 100  with your promiscuity tweet and today s verse...but she is struggling and making poorer choices for it.
late sunday night  catching up on your vids before I head off to bed! I wanted to make sure I had enough time to sit down and watch.
orange man works with the space man I d just say they re rivals maybe. also I got biden s underwear  there s a skidmark  Im telling the truth
I really enjoy the way you break down the scripture. everyone always seems to make excuses for themselves to go sin and call them selves a Christian. but it really does say it in the Bible. like yeah you can be saved but its like making the narrow path a tight rope.
reason 1 why twitter is so popular  you can post a single post and argue with the other side all week. that is missing on any other platform  like truth. everyone saying they are leaving twitter will be back within a few months.
great video  and positive energy to you
melonie mac   this is deeeeep...   fwiw   I believe I know what you were trying to convey in terms of what you were thinking.  I was initially going to respond in this post by saying  we ve all been there   but then I realized perhaps that might not be the best response for similar reasons...
the figurehead in charge doesnt really matter  they re just the most visible. its the people that get appointed to positions of power that actually affect things for the most part as far as the executive branch goes. now in terms of the house   senate... they need to institute term limits in some form  probably a higher threshold than the executive. there s no reason there should be 40  year incumbent senate members that hold society back. at least the house is generally more fluid. either way  wouldn t trust any of em farther than I could throw em.modern games are a mixed bag. personally Im not looking for an extreme challenge  I wont play a game on the hardest difficulty because I dont want the frustration that comes along with it. Im your age melonie  I have better things do to with my time than repeat the same stage or whatever 3 dozen times before I get through it. I want to play the game for enjoyment   stress relief. we re not in highschool anymore with unlimited free time   a lot less stress in our lives. and Im definitely not as spry as some 14 year old kid that games like they re on crack  my reaction times are down no matter how much I d like to deny it.at the same time  I dont want a cake walk. I want some fair difficulty  which several games have delivered on. they re hard but fair  they dont pull any bs gimmicks to make the experience harder and the mechanics are tight. off the top of my head I canthink of the soulslike nioh for one  I knew if I wasn t doing well it was because of my performance. I had to buy a new controller just for that game because I realized mine was worn out   drifting  which wasn t apparent on other games because of how tight the gameplay was on this one. it was an immediate change in how I was performing with the new controller. another was streets of rage 4  pretty hard until you get a grasp on the mechanics and then it becomes second nature. there s a fine balance that needs to be met in my opinion.
I hate it when Im playing a game   and Im enjoying the game  and like in three hours I beat the game. I like games that takes several hours a day  upon several days in a week  upon potentially several weeks to play. I also like games that you can play with friends. I always love and look forward to your content.
so ny post must bee a satire
I never once cared about the sex of the character or thought tomb raider needed a male character model. the puzzles made the game fun. where I live chicken fillets are cheaper than thigh fillets. in australia we had a scientist develop the  atkin diet   which is a protein based diet. I still find it hard to believe thatsugar isn t a nutrient!
keep up the excellent work  melonie.
@matt perkins   l was being hyperbolic.   at least he s sticking it to far worse cronies.  the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  and you can say what you wanna say without walking on eggshells
imagine touting abortion as the better option when compared to birth control......I cant even with these people.
honestly  I cant imagine the dating scene right now. Ive been with my girlfriend for 12 years this june. from an outside perspective  the dating scene looks like a war zone.
always go through archives to show the original story before it can be stealth edit.
the trend is just toward a more traditional worldview  at least this is how it appears to me. who s in office will push things along faster  but they are moving in that direction because all of this debauchery that was preached to us throughout the last 30-40 years has clearly made everything worse.
should someone be denied intimacy without commitment  bring this up in simpcast.
10 30 you are a gamer when you put playing a game above ahead other leisure activities  have you ever lets say decided not to hang out with friends on a day because an event happened in an mmo  or maybe a new game just came out so you are not seeing light for 2 days. 10 00 personally what I want in a game is something like konosuba anime  Im an adventurer in the world  Im not a major player in the world if I dont want to be  Im just existing and making it to the next day  itseems like there is a game made by the morrowind people that may give me this  just not in a joke style game.
God bless melonie! thanks for reading my previous comment.
what we go through in life growing up. all the stuff  life  the good the bad  and the stupid we all do. it made us who we are today. saved or unsaved  God has and always will be in control!
melonie. I wanted to share with you  as a sister in Christ. I had a problem with corn for decades. its like what keith green a great musician you should check him out .keith wrote in a article in one of his last days pamphlets. the mind is like a theater  what you look at stays there. as with corn  one repents  prays. then it pops up when you least expect.  I found when those old thoughts lead to corn  I reach for my Bible   read it and pray to our loving God. so I am always in need of prayer.  thank you for this site  you may never know how many people you are helping this side of heaven. God bless you and your family.
merge the two and call it twitter truth
without context you saying  corn  is ruining people is the funniest thing ever. great videos  love when you share Bible verses.
hey! I resemble that toxic gamer remark!  I hate losing when I am where Im supposed to be and teammates are not.
I like the plethora of ideas from todays verse s  of the day.  the verse of  food is for the stomach and stomach for food   yet the body is not meant for sexual immorality   the idea of  if you are hungry go eat.  however  this does not necessarily apply to the desires of a physical nature is very well said and simply put in a digestible way for many.  the best part of the verse though was  flee immorality     the concept of the only way to fight immoral physical desires is by fleeing it is well said and appropriate and helpful to many.  giving in to immoral sexual desire defiles our bodies in ways in which our bodies were not intended for.  mostly  common sense stuff but what do I know  Im just an amateur when it comes to deciphering this stuff.  I commented on the whole thing but realized I had a book written  so I chopped it down a bit.  sorry  if itseems a little disjointed.
even though I lean more conservative I do believe people should think for themselves. I dont expect every person to share my political views
Imean thatsounds like compliment any way  big if true
first  arcangelofwar is correct. any marksman will tell you to never shoot for the leg. its mostly pointless  because you ll probably miss the moving target  unless a shotgun - hand guns are very inaccurate . if you do land the shot  adrenaline and things tend to keep them going. chest shot is the quickest and most effective way to disable them. this is for defense purposes only  of course! second  is to your question about infidelity. I d rather explain my thoughts on this personally  not publicly   because this whole thing of cheating has changed my life rather drastically. we ve communicated on facebook  so tell me where and how Imight be able to communicate with you privately     edit oh crap you have a discord  I ll join that lol infidelity is awful and it ruins lives. that is the bottom line.
I wish all young people would tune in to the verse of the day portion of this video. such an important topic considering how sexualized society is today. pron and of is sucking the souls out of men until they re nothing but a shell of who they once were. if you want to know why there is so many beta men on this planet today  look no further. always have discipline and integrity fellas. God is your light in the darkness!
hey mel  youre absolutely right about promiscuity and hookup culture. dont let anyone discourage you from believing what God makes clear in the Bible. youre a special woman for having lived through the culture of this world and yet coming back to realize God is always right. Im happy that the spirit is working these things in you    the sexual revolution was an absolute travesty  and we ve all suffered its effects and will continue to for decades to come. however  the sad fact is that up until then  yes  women were treated awfully even in  civilized  society  and the image society had of sex was overly repressive  even for God s standards. there was some value to what first wave feminists fought for  but things have clearly been taken overboard. casual sex is not power  and has hurt the world more than anything  and hookup culture is objective garbage  as much as young people want to romanticize it and live their lives around it  and yes  casual sex is absolutely an idol . Jesus is the answer that lost people are seeking in these vain pursuits  but as paul says in first corinthians 1   the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those that are perishing.  God has a perfect plan for each human but only those who trust in Christ s sacrifice and resurrection can see that plan and be comforted that its all in his hands. keep speaking the truth! no matter how much backlash you get. lost people are gonna do lost people things  that is  their flesh is going to revolt against the truth because thats just the nature we re all born with. first corinthians 1 says again   for since  in the wisdom of God  the world through wisdom did not know God  it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.  proud of your faithfulness to the Lord on this platform. praying for you  God bless you.
that is some really strange framing by the ny post. I saw that interview with devin nunes and he didn t imply that there was any personal conversation. even nothing of what was quoted in the article implied some sort of direct communication. tons of people  encouraged  elon  I dont get why they would try to imply...oh yea  because just say the name trump and you get thousands of hate clicks.
@melonie mac go boom     only two false claims in just one day !  those people are falling behind!
that verse is a very complicated topic  indeed. there s no way promiscuity is good for you. it would be like any other drug. and drugs lead to addictions. and addictions lead to very poor choices that will hurt the soul  and ultimately affect those around you  negatively. its written in the Bible for a reason its flat-out not healthy. however  I think you can be with someone whom you love  and if they love you back. and I think itshould be spiritual  as well as physical. now does that require marriage  its an interesting discussion  at least. this is a hard topic for me to talk about  personally.
I think trump should have made two truth socials  one family friendly   the other just whatever  but I guess thats happening with twitter  btw  I support rename t. s. to trumpet!
Im sure the new york post knows exactly what inspired musk. they can read minds after all.
anybody else remember when elon wore a white coat with  new world order   in latin  on the back to the met gala awards a few years ago  but the words were also stitched in white so it wouldn t be so obvious  yeah. Im not exactly sold on the guy. and with speaking latin  in witchcraft going back many years  spells and hexes are cast in latin. the elite s interesting latin is something I dont feel great about
I am dominated by vinyl albums....especially the alternate vinyl schemes definitely. but yea....promiscuity is bad.
I am so torn about your hair when I see your videos.  I love the natural look  but when you flatten it  you look so much like lara!
would it be a  toot  on trumpet  y all see what trump tooted Ive been in a few relationships and not one of my girlfriends could go more than a months into the relationship before questioning my sexuality or giving me the ultimatum of sex or breakup. I think cosmo has warped a generation of females and other relationships they ve been in. sex is important in a relationship but spending 4 seasons with someone is a better tell. amen
I like the idea of twitter being middle  truth social being conservative.and 99  of everything being left.
trumpet is a much better name than truth social. truth social sounds like they had a large group of unimaginative people brainstorm for way too long.
you are awesome!
as someone who leans heavily toward the  wokie  side  I respectfully disagree with about 95  of the social commentary portions of your videos  but I really enjoy the  verse of the day  and those discussions because I am also Christian. I hope you feel encouraged to get more and more in depth with those as time goes on. they re very good food for thought. Im glad youre sticking with thatsection despite the pushback you ve mentioned. God bless!
with exception to maybe his girls and barron - don doesnt seem to care about anyone but himself and Im not entirely sold on his relationship with his girls being fatherly.
all I know is elon musk is a pretty cool guy.  my friends and I think he s got a secret iron man program.  it would work on a tesla battery instead of an arch reactor.  you have to admit he s the most tony stark like person in the real world.  anyone else think musk is working on becoming a superhero
I was actually thinking realizing this morning that many of the things the Bible says to not do that a lot of people are sensitive about is because we are sinning against ourselves and by extension the one who created us and who offers a path to redemption. God doesnt want us to sin against ourselves because he doesnt want us to make ourselves less than we are  to not dehumanize ourselves to be like feral beasts. humans were created to be like God  we were set aside with a higher intelligence and given living crowns upon our heads that we could trim or form however we wished. the animals were to look to us as we look to God  the plan was for us to be the closest thing to God without actually being God - the children of God... and I believe the plan hasn t changed much  its just been postponed. I believe the revival kingdom will see the redeemed humans ascend back to the role we were created for on a new fused heaven and earth with a kingdom surrounded by fields populated with every animal plant on earth and new animals plants.God didn t tell the jews to avoid pork because he didn t want them to eat pigs  he didn t want them to get sick and even today  with modern science  eating pigs is still riskier than other meats. he doesnt want us to eat or drink in excess  take reckless risks or have sex with anybody we even find attractive in passing because it is a sin against the bodies and souls he gave us thatstill mostly bear his image of perfection.its no surprise that one of the requirements of a nazirite vow is to not cut our hair  or beards  because it brings us back closer to the state in which we were created and any dehumanization we have taken on can be more easily undone.God doesnt want us to sin against him our connection with him  other humans or ourselves because none of those are good and none of those are or lead to the blessings he intended for us.
if you dont  vote  you have no right to  complain
apparrently jakaI never played the witcher 3   red dead redemption2  or even horizon zero dawn. all 3 has superb stories.
sigh  look at the author and who owns what their talking on  you learn far more that way than actually reading their articles madiline  its a habit I got into with youtube with their clickbait titles  like I d look at the source  who sponsors them  and you already get the jist without giving them views or clicks  as this buy out is such a good thing they are literally trying every trick in the book to stop himhell you should have stopped after reading  new york  as the source  let alone the post  as their a smear merchant newspaper  always have been.and what do smear merchant newspapers do  they doctor photos  make up headlines and do anything to pull in views and reads at the checkout line  and you fell for it hook line and sinker.
glad elon did buy it!! maybe it wont be toxic in the near future.
if its true  then good. twitter  you ve brought this upon yourself harder than anakin brought on his own self destruction.
my body is a temple.I wish.mine is more like a fast food joint.
disclaimer   Im trying to do this without a Bible in front of me.  I have to bring up romans 6 1 into the theology discussion.   do I keep sinning so grace can abound   heaven forbid!   we are called out of sin to holiness.  1 peter and 1 john    Im trying to be quick  Im @ work  gospel of john says  red letters  remain in me  and I will remain in you.edited this after work Im a leonard ravenhill guy.  he preached revival  which we as a country definitely need.  the problem for us  itseems today s church is about theology statements than what the Bible says.
make sex biblical again

your channel could get millions of views if you just  work to see what these people are about. neo-malthusians or what they have turned it into is more like it.
sometimes love in this world  instead means lust. look at the greek meaning of tve word love. there are numerous definitions of the different ways love in used in the scripture.  example of a few. I love pizza. I love my brother. I love my wife. all different meanings of the word love  ect..
trumpet does sounds better than twitter..lol
ms mac  the police went into target looking for the teens  they followed them around the store for a bit. rather than detaining after they left the store  they waited for the suspects to get into their vehicle. mind you  these cops had no body cam because  they were training in a parking lot  so they were out of uniform and in unmarked cars. the cops never identified themselves. after the teens started to drive off  multiple vehicles surrounded them and got in their way. again  unmarked. the cops got out of the car and the teens got scared  a bunch of dudes with guns pointed at you got out  they look like thugs  no uniform   they tried to drive off and the cops  without hesitation  unloaded their entire magazines into the car. even with civilians on the parking lot and them not having a reason to shoot. the cops willingly and consciously escalated the situation to its maximum level when it could have been avoided. the guy who died was shot in the chest  one of the teens got out of the car and put his hands up  scared about why a bunch of random people are shooting at them. the police thought it was funny and literally began to shoot his hands  blowing off his fingers. it was target practice at that point. the family of all the people involved got some of the top lawyers in the state  the sheriff is using marsy s law to protect the deputies  he s pretty much fucked. he wiped his hands clean and is now shoving it to another agency to do the investigation. every day something new pops up. all witnesses are saying the cops went full rambo and were out for blood  all the photos and evidence out in public also show thats the case. we the people living here  have been warning others about this for years  but no one gives a shit because cops are to be worshipped. Im for cops  not pro cops. but living here and interacting with these specific cops is another world. Imyself almost was shot by one after I asked for directions for the exit of the private area  first time there  night time and raining   he got out of his truck came up to my window screaming about how I should give him a reason while his hand was on top of his service weapon. y all dont understand how dangerous these cops are. and this is coming from a military person who was deployed. even we didn t have that anger towards the taliban  and we had rules of engagement. we treat terrorists better than americans. thats not right. again  Im for cops  but these guys are on a huge power trip that ends up with people dying.
2 wings same birb dats what I always say too
elon denies communications with trump.  trump did say quietly.  jedImind trick.
I doubt trump encouraged elon to do anything. p.s I dont like politics in my gaming.
they re desperate
I fthe remake tr like ff 7  heck yea!  if they remak eit like crono cross  oh nooo.

heh.
melonie  1 corinthians 6  12-20 is super confusing maybe its the version that you are reading I read the kjv and the niv proverbs 5 makes way more sense maybe you cantake a read
do you think God would create someone to fail  aka  being born this way
2024 we re going to be back in action
.

ah those teens  always up to no good.
@jomi  and
we are all born sinners  so God did not inherently create us this way  but moreso when sin was brought into the world it plagued humanity. so yes. people are born sinful  some have different sinful desires than others  but either way sinful desire is innate. nobody is born without any sinful desire in some form or another.
@melonie mac go boom  but some would call that  desire  a way of life   not something to be overcome. if God made a sin that could not be conquered....... you see what road im traveling
I thought you were smarter than this. it doesnt matter who s in office   !!have you not noticed since biden youre paying double for gas and the price on everything has went up so if youre not part of working toward a solution...what exactly are you doing
