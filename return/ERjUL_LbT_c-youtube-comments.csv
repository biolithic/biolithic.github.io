offer back to god every prayer  work  and suffering of the day  no matter how insignificant or unspectacular they may seem to us... between god and the individual soul  however  there are no insignificant moments  this is the mystery of divine providence. the fact you re trying to live your life for god and proclaim him in your videos means none of your work is insignificant. you ve touched and helped so many people  so i hope that you know that your hustle and hard work is worth more than you may realize. keep being you and keep planting seeds

i never ever get tired or bored watching how unique you are. continue doing an outstanding job because it brings smiles  joy and happiness to us alllllll the time. never stop nor quit because you give hope   inspiration to us that want to achieve the same success as you. thank you for all that you do   give.

well now there effing with perfect dark  i guess its a good thing i have an emulator of it for the n64. also melonie i just need to point out that i love how you rarely curse. i love that you use hecking instead of other 4 letter words. so i just want to say thank you and much respect.

you re drop-kicking life like a boss! i love it! seriously  thank you for all that you do   if you ever feel like what you do isn t enough  i hope you ll take to heart this quote from walter ciszek   for me  each day came forth from the hand of god newly created and alive with opportunities to do his will...
