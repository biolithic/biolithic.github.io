I cant tell you how important it is to see a fellow believer engaged in this theater of the culture war  video games  media  etc.  as Christians we re supposed to be salt and light in every corner of our society  but its always felt lacking in this area. with games and the like being a major avenue of escapism  especially for young men  its vitally important there s folks that can share the truth and hope of God s word to them  so you got a very unique and important ministry sister!

I just found your channel this week through simpcast  which I found through either friday night tights or slightly offensive  but you have quickly become my favorite because youre Christian  and you seem strong and passionate in whatever you do. you feel very relatable to me  being a single 34 year old Christian into games and anime and blah blah blah

haha a woman of faith with common sense and down to earth. what s not to like!

dang  melonie spittin Christian wisdom. didn t think the road would lead here but glad it did. this was super refreshing. glad I found your content again.

so in those times of spiritual drought  as it were  where we dont want to read our Bible  etc.  we need to be all the more active in our faith  recalling the lesson of job  otherwise  yes  we will know when God draws away from us as we draw away from him.  pax melonie!  another great video!

Im so glad you are encouraging us to draw near to God!  those Bible verses are lovely.also Im even more excited to play elden ring after you pointed out that it has the og tomb raider games  sense of solitude and isolation.  yes  please!

I can relate to a lot of what you said in the Bible commentary. before 2016  I had been more involved with my church  helping a men s group I was with in doing annual fund raisers  like an ice cream booth at the fair  and the fall sprinkler blowout - things that help the community and give back to the church. unfortunately  my then new job got in the way  and I found it hard to balance between the two. getting back into a few things. but  for now  just making it to sunday worship would be a great start. anyways  thank you for the verses  and am enjoying your take on modern gaming.

each Christian s walk with God  ups and downs  moments of victory and moments of defeat by our own undoing and the grace of God present through it all guiding them through the wilderness as the spirit also guides us today.God bless you  and thank you for your content. looking forward to seeing more of you!

your speech at the end was very poignant for me. itstepped on my toes in the way that they needed to be stepped on. I have been lacking in my quiet time with God  and I guess he used you to remind me of what  and who  Ive been denying. thank you so much.

heya  extremely glad to find a youtuber with rational views that values the merits and mechanics of games over the social political views  and tops off every video with a Bible discussion! youre a diamond in the rough and I cant wait to see more of your content

I love how open you are with your Christianity. I too have been trying to read the Bible more. keep up the great work. my day is a bit more brighter when I see your videos.

random comment  thanks for the Bible verses in the end. with the way the last couple of years had been  I appreciate this alot.

Ive noticed you are trying to grasp meaning from the Bible. I think you are benefiting from the verses for yourself as much as us

Ive been struggling to read my Bible often.  Christ is king!

okay I know I need to read my Bible more often that where I struggle hard nice to hear Im not the only 35 year old that is single.
dang! openly talking about Jesus and admitting to being Christian! brave. keep being open and firm in your belief. pray often.

I like hearing your takes on the Bible... Im not that into souls like games though...

thanks for the Bible read at the end. its much appreciated mel!

its always a plus to see a very  attactive woman that is also a Bible person as well. it just give me more of a want to binge all the videos

love your Bible verses reminds me of another Christian over 40 years ago on of all places cnn they had a celebrity chef graham kerr the galloping gourmet who did short segments of recipies and he insisted on a Bible verse at the end of each just like you keep up the good work

Ive subscribed. I value your perspective. keep on doing your thing

I know I be joking around a lot in your comments  but this time Im serious.Im a believer myself from way back. however  I have my fair share of regrets and mistakes.now Im in bad health and a lot of pain. Im kind of scared and worried for my loved ones.since I know youre a true believer girl  Im asking you to please pray for me okay. thank you

melonie  me again. I need prayer from you and your group of praye warriors. I am going through a trying time. temptation is knocking  so hard. I know temptation is not  sin. but giving into it is.  thank you all.
