this month a woman in cumbria was sentenced to 8 and a half years in jail for false rape claims. hopefully this will set a precedent  in the uk at least  that making such serious allegations is not acceptable. it can ruin peoples  lives
once again melonie was correct. this shows exactly what is wrong with cancel culture. they attack melonie because they dont like their evil deeds being exposed.
man got fired from projects he co-created  based on rumors. people so anxious to jump on something without thinking.we really live in the world where you are punished before you have a chance to prove your innocence.
i will honestly admit that i am not a rick and morty fan  but i am a fan of watching cancel culture lose. and you re right  melanie  we should not just jump to conclusions.prayers that justin is able to come back from all this thanks for another great video  melanie  and god bless  everyone
anyone remember the duke lacrosse case a little over 15 years ago.  everyone had condemned the team before it came out that the woman lied.
melonie!  d so happy to see a brand new video from you! praying for you  girl. praying that god moves powerfully in your life  and trusting that what you re dealing with are just stepping stones along the path to becoming who god ultimately wants you to be. you ll be bolder  stronger and godlier than you were before. do what you need to do  and we ll be here praying and supporting you each step of the way    also  congrats on 130k! super well deserved
the thing that stuck out about this one was that a lot of the crew on rick and morty seemed to already want to get rid of him. even dan harmon was sick of him.  so  yeah  the accusation was fake  but rick and morty just wanted him gone. the video game company he started that kicked him out is worse  but he ll still get royalties forever
thanks for everything you do melonie! stay strong!
great to see a follow-up on this from the last video. nice to see that waiting for more info paid off. have a wonderful day  melonie. you look very beautiful   love to see your videos and streams whenever you are up to doing them  melonie.
i assumed that this would be the case when i first heard about it  which is kind of a shame since i had no special insight that led me to that conclusion. instead of  the boy that cried wolf  its  the woman that cried abuse
i never watched rick and morty before  but i hate when people gets fired for accusations that haven t been proven true or false. hopefully everything turns out the way it should  whoever is innocent walks away and whoever isn t gets punished. also glad to see you re doing well melonie. keep on standing firm on the word of god. bless you.
hey melonie  people usually never learning from past mistakes after making same mistakes  over again
i don t like justin roiland or rick   morty anymore but i m able to put aside my bias and say he was done dirty. ever since the vic mignogna situation  i ve learned to observe both sides instead of throwing my lot automatically with the accuser.
happy to see you re still doing okay. gotta love to see the attention seekers fail  especially when it s at the risk of another person s reputation and paycheck. i love when you bring the bible into it  people need to hear it. have a great day please  always wishing the best for you.
cancel culture does not seek justice  the seek destruction. in the case of justin roiland - his career is already ruined. i ll be interested to see if the case being dismissed has any impact on his future but  i m not holding my breath.
i don t know how in depth people followed the entirety of this scenario but  his court case was just an excuse to get rid of him! his workplace  and sketchy personal life  behavior was abhorrent. the negative reports coming out on him after the court case was revealed had nothing to do with what he was accused of. even his statement after the dismissal didn t address what co-workers said about his workplace behavior. this isn t a case of  cancel culture  winning or losing. it s an example of taking advantage of a bad situation to get rid of someone seen as a problem.
god bless you melanie for being proud of your faith.  amen sister
let s go melonie! i ve been waiting for you to talk about this!!
great video  loved it! and i hope and pray everything works out mel god bless you and anyone who reads this.  much love to all!
the only way to solve this is there has to be a plenty for false accusations immediately after the case is dismissed by the judge.
exactly. lies should be punished severely.
@just chill  then why is it okay for melonie mac to make up lies about sean sarto
we live in a society where people are obsessed with virtue signaling.
we live in a dying society.
i think there was some truth to it  especially since other staff members came out and said stuff about him  who knows  maybe they were planning on it for a while and used the rumors as qn excuse
@the aqua mage  i worked in couple of companies for many years  and one thing that never changes was human nature. you d be surprised how quickly your colleagues will throw you under the bus either out of jealousy  spite or heck  just to make themselves look good or go out of their way to distance themselves from  bad guys . hollyweird people are just bunch of egomaniacs who will backstab each other if this means good publicity for them. zero loyalty. at. all. just look at poor johnny depp and how many of his co-workers and friends quickly turn against him  despite being  friends  with him since like 80s.
@njmfff  i dont think he is full on innocent though. there have been reports of him being a creep or saying weird stuff. is it illegal  no. especially where there wasnt enough evidence to convict him that he actually did those acts.
@the aqua mage  reports... not evidence. reports are nothing else than somebody else having a problem with you regardless of why. so you cannot take em seriously without evidence.
@the aqua mage he literally said on a podcast that he liked minors...
how are you not a rick and morty fan    what about solar opposites
@eric barth  i m not saying it s a bad show  i m just saying that it never clicked with me the way does with other people
nawww there s definitely something off about that justin guy . let s keep him away from this show.
@eric barth because it s dumb and not funny or fun
i honestly don t buy any of this celebrity drama  i think it s all just an act to keep the people distracted by pointless things.especially the johnny depp trial  i would bet everything i have that was all staged bs  there was no actual trial. it s just another movie  only difference is they tell people it s real.
the r and m cartoon is vulgar content
@aj nunez  if he s not involved just cancel it then  you can t keep making the show without him  he voices both rick and morty and another of other characters  plus he s a writer.
i heard there were photos of his chatlogs were those fake or is this dismissal wrong everyone said he did some weird crap.
@eric barth rick and morty is kind of dumb to me personally.i also don t like justins voice its grating and morty is like a wimpy version of marty mcfly and honestly as a bttf fan i can t really watch those two characters.not to mention its most famous jokes seem to be legitimately the worse kind of ones like people just saying pickle rick over and over.spongebob had me quoting more.
i remember it well.  that s the one that turned into a pr disaster for rolling stone magazine  i believe.  they also lost a huge slander suit as a result.
@michael hayes  you are thinking of the rape on campus story  which was like the ultimate journalism failure. the funny thing is even before the details came out the story itself was so ridiculous no one in their right mind would believe it. and yes  they got sued to hell over it and rightfully lost.
this is real.
thank you so much
now i m going to rewatch all seasons   just ones he is in.  . can t deny original rick until i breath shmucck. i m pickleeeee riiiiiick!
he was not done dirty he literally said on a podcast that he liked minors!
we want justin back.
that doesn t even make sense. if you don t want someone working for you  you just fire them. you don t need a pretext.  i don t want you working here  is reason enough.
@jamesp81  well  what you re saying is valid. but there are times  and industries  where it s just not that simple. there s  politics  in play most of the time in hollywood  and the entertainment industry as a whole . take the victoria alonso situation  for example. she has always been head of vfx for the mcu  and for just about everything in phase 4  and 5   the vfx have been garbage. you ve even had revolts in different vfx houses with them refusing to work with for alonso and the mcu. but  because she had time with the company...plus she s a lesbian minority woman...they couldn t just  up  n fire  her. they used a technicality to fire her  it was flimsy  but legit . same principal applies to justin roiland. again  going by the statements of his co-workers  he has been a pain in the ass since season 2 of  rick   morty . but because he was co-creator creator of all the projects he was involved in  it was going to have to something significant for cartoon network to cut ties. the charges were all it took. it s shady but  that s how a lot of business is done on the higher levels.
agree
hope everything goes well for ya.
the parallel between the sin of gossip    cancel culture  is a huge insight
hey  melonie i m so happy to see you back making videos again   i hope you are doing well with yourself too. also i have to say that cancel culture is wrong and it needs to stop before it gets to worse in future and beyond and i will not tolerate or stand up for it at all and i will support anyone who gets hurt like this guy by evil people who don t have any respect for culture issues like this and i will be very happy for him to be left alone and let him get back to his life and let him keep doing his job that he has done for several years  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to make a comment on your video for today  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great week this week and i hope you are having a great day today at home and so i just wanted to tell you that to have a wonderful and great blessed day today and have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great weekend too.
keep bringing the word  mel! i love to see how god s using you!
does this mean he can go back to rick   morty  because he was the show.
my emotional reaction was pure rage that he was being extra-judiciously penalized while an active  trial was happening in court. and i was pretty disgusted that there were screenshots attempting to ruin his reputation that didn t involve an actual court trial or police report. it may seem to be a bit hypocritical of me  but i got angry with eliza bleu for violating other peoples inalienable rights  legally threatening lives  through easily proven fraudulent means and nepotism aiding a known organized iniative to harm our nation  standing with her. so i can t see how i violated my core principles and choose to validate my own anger over both.
i love the show he made and i m so grateful that he did but we re just gonna ignore the dms now we don t know if those are real and the podcast that sounded real to me i ve also heard he was a bitch in the writers rooms and sometimes would come in drunk and not do the voice lines at all he also hasn t written to much episodes in the show i think he has only written like 6 episodes but it s up to adult swim if they hire him back not to us
let s not forget the leaked texts and stuff he did. that stuff is actually really illegal
nailed it. makes me wonder about what i went through with my cancellation.
back in 2015 a girlfriend jackie made up false arrogations. i literally got her on tape admitting she faked the assault that she lied that she stole money from me. they still pretty much ruined my life and she faced no consequences i was even charged for recording her on my cell phone admitting she lied. spend a year on probation. for recording her admitting she lied. pennsylvania.  she faced absolutely no consequences.
this gives me hope that we ll see a high on life two or at least more games from justin roiland
brave woman whos not afraid to speak the truth  keep it up
i hope he doesn t go back  says screw you guys  and goes and does creative things for someone who won t abandon him.
love when you bring up christian mentality. very wholesome and good for the soul. bless up
there have to be consequences for destroying people s careers  financial penalties  prison time  etc. there s a reason one of the ten commandments in a prohibition against bearing false witness.
stay safe  melonie  and keep speaking the truth of god!
an interesting subject. keep up the good work. god be with ya.
just the factscancel culture is terible. never stop being you melonie. plus that s a cool shirt. you look beautiful melonie
the internet loves 2 things. acting morally superior  usually the same people who have the worst skeletons in their own closet   and a good old fashioned witch hunt. people revel in the drama of it all. it s been guilty until proven innocent for as long as i can remember and people aren t going to learn anything if they haven t already. this will happen again and again.
hi melonie good content and spreading and opening people to religion . can i ask you a question thoughts on games like max payne and la noire
agreed  we want justin back
that isn t  evidence.
@patrick henry  what are you talking about  of course it is
if it were illegal he d be charged with something. it was gross  sure. but he never propositioned a minor for sex or made any plans to meet with her. he just made dirty jokes in a chat with an underage fan  who had no problem with it until he was getting canceled .
@jonazo  wait  really
@incinium z     what dms did you see  i didn t see any where he said he wanted to meet with her or where he sent her explicit images. he made dirty jokes and said she was jailbait and said inappropriate things  but i don t think anything in the dms that were made public rose to the level of illegality  nor anything that shows she was uncomfortable with the messages when he sent them. if i had a daughter and he sent them to her  i d want him dead. but it doesn t make it a crime.
i agree. i m not asking for the dude to get cancelled but let s not all suddenly praise him like a hero. and for those people who are champion him like a hero. well you re not too bright.
text is way too easy to fake and technically not illegal i am pretty sure.
@aog plays  apparently there s also voice stuff  too  so it s not fake
@incinium z  you can also fake  voice stuff
@incinium z  oh  you were there
yeah don t forget that one time he alluded to the fact that 17.9 year old females can be just as hot as 18 year old ones.
i m so glad he was acquitted. i always hoped it would be just allegations and nothing more.
melonie i hope your  difficulty  is over soon. also remember to drink water.  stay safe. take care. have fun.
i seem to recall the quartering saying this was open and shut and calling him a really bad person
everyone should have their day in court if they re accused of any wrongdoing before they get  cancelled   especially if you don t personally care for them and i m no roiland fan. and always wait at least 48 hours before jumping in on any drama  facts will come out and you don t want to look like a fool
already saw this coming the moment he was accused
now we won t have the driving force and brilliance of justin to continue rick n morty... what happened to innocent until proven guilty
hey! i m sending good thoughts your way. thanks for the videos.god bless!
everytime i hear an accusation like this nowadays i always get suspicious of the accuser
happy friday melonie mac!please return to mario kart again with g g  rippa  lady rippa and dan vasc!
so happy. it definitely shows you all the fake fans and all those people out there who follow the flock. i will not watch the show without him. i stood behind justin all the way. with as actions im willing to wager they had something with it. justin rocks and is such a talented artist
don t feel bad about not constantly uploading. i have more subscriptions than i have time to watch!
thank god for this  i hope roiland comes back
love to be in the room when they beg him to come back.
keep the videos comin
so much for innocent until proven guilty. a business that fires someone based on accusations should be punished
hey melonie. you look great. hope you have a good weekend
i haven t finished this video yet. but i can t wait to see how you fit classic tomb raider in this one
cool been looking forward to a new video melonie always great to c u  u look amazing
what makes you think cc failed   he s still fired.  he s not going to be rehired.  his reputation is ruined.  he probably won t be able to find more work.  seems like it succeeded to me.  cc isn t about people going to the big house.  never waas.
hey melonie! hope you have a blessed day and a wonderful weekend. you look amazing today
the quartering loves himself a good celebrity drama. he gets a little twinkle in his eyes when someone s life is falling apart and then he makes 30 videos about it.
@mike dodson  the quartering love cheap clickbait and spending 15 minutes poorly reading twitter posts
so true  he may be able to recover a portion of his career but i doubt he ll ever fully recover. i hope am wrong.
first time posting on your videos. love them and really love your views!there was one thing you said though that i have to respectfully disagree with you about. the court didn t find him  innocent   they found him  not guilty
the orville episode  majority rule  was right on target.
huh i thought the allegations were for like being a predator.  which i believed just from how in some scenes they sexualized morty s sister.  thanks for the clear up
friday is hereeeee take care melonie
if people saw melanie s picture not knowing her  she could easily pass as 16. not that she would ever do that. hahaha!
after vic mignogna and johnny depp  yeah  i definitely learned to wait and see before jumping to conclusions. twitter  however  doesn t learn that quick  if at all.
time to reread to kill a mockingbird and understand the story might be fiction  but the occurrences were all too real.
i never believed in the charges. i sense a lie about this and you can t trust everything that has been said
good content alert    san jose sharks goalie refusing to wear pride flag jersey because it goes against his beliefs and religion. he was very respectful as well and stood his ground!
effort vs results this is a win for cancel culture
everyone just accepted that he is a creep   and i mean  he is a weird guy and i don t personally like him   but i would never wish for him to lose his job.
hopefully roiland will distance himself from the poison of hellywood and perhaps lend his voice in defense of other cancel-culture victims.  slim hope  admittedly... but still a hope.
you re expecting to much from the internet melonie.
there is a thing called presumption of innocence  by the way. shame that the woke crowd hasn t heard of it.
the funny thing is the people who came out and condemned him not one has said a word since the news
it didn t fail  though. dude lost his job and a major project he has been working on for years. he ll probably be a pariah in the industry now as well. an accused being found innocent or even never being taken to court is not new  the damage is already done.
but we re basing this solely off of what he has solely said  there s nothing about his other 2 charges  and the facts behind the case have not been brought forward  none of it.it all smells fishy on both sides  especially considering his ex partner didn t announce anything it was a journalist who had to hunt down this information in the first place  and we still have no idea of what supposedly happened or even what actually happened.
apparently if you hate someone enough  then that is all the proof you need to lock them up.
i really appreciate the christian messages on your channel  melonie. i stand by previous statements i made that you are a great disciple of christ.
have great day  you d think we learned after johnny depp one but i guess that was singularly
sorry  my phone posted that before i finished writing  basicly  the major difference is that there isn t enough evidence to convict. he might have done it  but just not enough evidence was found to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. not saying that is what happened here  but i just get bothered when people say a court found someone innocent.that being said  hate this happened to justin  and yes  cancel culture needs to be canceled.
no.
horrible.
i m glad he s been proven innocent but he won t get his job which is completely unfair.
i like the contrast between dicaprio and cavill. dicaprio can do no wrong but when cavill dates a younger woman  the media claws come out. my theory is that if cavill was more outspoken in overtly supporting the current narratives  he too would be untouchable.
nope. screw him. he wasn t canceled for dv it was for grooming. the dv allegations are years old but the dms were released recently. additionally i ve heard the groomer bs leave his own mouth on audio. if he died he wouldn t suffer enough.
women who falsely report innocent men for rape assault should be held accountable and put in jail for a long time.
so does roiland get to come back to the show
i hope your secret project is writing the script for the next tr.
you ever think that stanley kubrick  a man regarded as one of the greatest directors ever to have lived  would not last 5 minutes in today s industry as he d make shelley duvall cry and get fired half way through making the greatest horror film of all time.  was he right to make her break down on set  complicated question. i personally think you have to suffer to get to great art.
like i ve seen him being creepy with those weird dms but nothing else
those who don t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it
those that fired him have zero value as humans !
i don t think the case being dismissed makes much of a difference. he s still cancelled because people want him to be cancelled. they ll ignore every development that doesn t fit the narrative they already crafted. so i don t believe he ll be going back to rick and morty.
honestly cancel culture is like a online version of mob culture its creepy. but yeah the fact that he said nothing made me think like obviously something is going on and you shouldn t jump the gun and think he did it or its as bad as the internet is saying.  but even if he did do it or something like seeing the fans wanting him like burnt at the stake is weird like you are a fan of him so why wouldn t you want him to get help   like if you re a fan why wouldn t you want them to get help  like they just want to see people suffer and burnt to the ground. its really annoying. and im glad in this case it got dropped completely like he didn t even do anything and  fans  were like screw him blah blah blah and making memes about how he is annoying  and he isn t as funny as people think adn these are people that used to love him and stuff so i don t get it.
ah... i love the smell of napalm lawsuits in the morning.
cancel culture failed only if he gets to return to his shows and video game studio where he worked.right now  he is still resigned from his game studio.  and fired from adult swim  rick end morty  and solar opposites.so  cancel culture  technically  did succeed.but  also co-workers still threw him under the bus and accused him of inappropriate behaviors.we  who were not direct witness  don t know if  or what he actually did or  didn t do.
twitter is the best place to spread miss information lol.
back with another banger. have a blessed day ms mac go boom
love your show
people aren t being consistent if they don t sell all their crap.
4 06 confirmed melonie is a super-secret-spy-agent-tomb-raider-superhero-wizard  it is the only logical explanation
but did you guys hear justin talking about how it used to be so normal for underage girls to get married and we should accept that as normal now  lil sus.
life is unfair.
we want justin back!
meh  he can create his own version of rick and morty.
i agree. he is back on track.
this girl is awesome.
i think the same conclusion jumpers are going to wait it out on the ant-man apollo actor who was just arrested for domestic violence.
karma is a real thing and everyone who does something immoral will get punishment.
innocent until proven guilty
i m actually relieved that he was exonerated. let s face it  rick and morty just wouldn t be the same without roiland.
yes  cancel culture bad. but im more curious as to the cause of it  white knighting and just blatant hate of anything straight white and male  but i think it has more to do with jealousy. people don t like  their own status in life so as soon as they smell blood in the water  they jump on a celebrity because we want to know their success isn t earned  that they re bad and worse than us  because we hate our lives so much
i would just like to add  i actually commented something like this on another channel that was speaking about some entirely different topic  i said something like the lord is revealing the truth. and god can and will reveal any evil that is being done against another behind closed doors. he may not reign his vengeance on the person doing wrong right away  but he does bring things out into the open. plus i m going to continue to pray about your stalker situation  and hopefully god will bring all of that to an end for you. once again god bless you.
i m just gonna say it. even if everything was true  what does his personal life has to do with his professional life  i would understand if he did something at work  but he didn t. people mess up and only god is perfect  expecting perfection from a human is why we are in a societal downward spiral. so yeah  even if he was guilty i wouldn t cancel him
always assume they are innocent until proven guilty... isn t that the basis of what our whole justice system is supposed to be based on
i m not surprised it turned out that the guy was innocent. i also won t be surprised if he doesn t get his job back. in my opinion this is not a cancel culture problem. it s a false accusations problem. innocent until proven guilty apparently doesn t count when it is against men.
didn t his texts with an underage girl leak
as jp says  men resolve to physical violence  women resolve to character assassination.
it was wrong for the company to fire him with no evidence!they can have suspended him from the job until the judge made a judgment on the case. if he was guilty  he loose his job. but if he is not guilty  he goes back to work!it s that simple people!listen to facts  not hear say! p.s.  and the person who made the fake claims should go to jail for 4 months for defamation and waste state time!
justin roiland had lost everything career-wise. i d say cancel culture succeeded in his case.
i hate that so many are so ready to destroy others on little to no evidence or for little or no real reason.  it is one of the worst aspects of modern humanity in this country.  and absolutely the bible is a good thing to rely on for how we should be.  love your neighbors  and that means everyone.  even if we don t like them  we still need to be mindful and be loving in that we don t jump to conclusions  we expect ourselves to be flawed and imperfect  and we wait for the facts before we draw conclusions.  we all effectively live in glass houses  so none of us should be throwing stones.
hey kind of new but love the content!
you re a pureblood  and a very strong young lady to stand by your principles and what you believe in. those former friends of yours will rue the day they turned their backs on you  but of course they posess none of your inner-strength or scruples.
if i was him  i would push the most anti - woke  sexist filled jokes in a season of rick and morty to hurt them feminist
are the dms legit
chris avellone is innocent of all charges
.i wonder if she got the same energy with what s happening with jonathon majors .
do you really think he goes back to work with the team that backstabbed him without hesitation  rick and morty is dead!
@r8x  fair enough  but the way things sounded roiland didn t want to completely give up on rick and morty. i wouldn t be surprised if lawsuits start appearing against rick and morty.
yeah  they won t let him back anyhow. he s already been burned
just to clarify  if he did illegal stuff he should go to jail. it would be his due to pay. but why are we canceling people professionally and creatively
i see your point behind women being the weaker vessel  but i don t entirely agree. if not only for childbirth  which is the hardes thing a human body does to itself in just about every way  and only women are capable of this females are also quicker to move on mentally and emotionally in most cases and these days they definitely have a stronger voice. roiland  jd  aj and a few others come to mind immediately as prime examples. aj may not seem so much so  but it was a female that led the case against him and he got hit with the largest civil lawsuit in history.
you say cancel culture has failed  but i m not so sure it has. he s been fired or dropped from rick and morty  right  any malicious intent from the accusation has already been achieved. the charges have been dropped after he s already had his reputation tarnished.
we want justin roiland back!
where is the punishment for the accusers  in god s law it is written that a false accuser ought to get the penalty that the accused would have gotten if the accused was found guilty.
companies haven t learned anything and they never will till they go bankrupt
you know  i can t really tell if people who sees the dropped charges are being serious if they say what people are saying now like in this comment section.the same people who are saying how this is an example of an innocent person being falsely accused of something and how we shouldn t  instantly believe accusations  are likely the same people who instantly believed the accusations. they re part of the problem. when i heard about these  i didn t instantly believe what was going on. sure  i did feel disappointed in roiland but kept my fingers crossed that hopefully maybe it wasn t true  and when i expressed how i was skeptical on the accusations  people got all attack on me saying how i was being  terrible  for not believing it. and i m glad that i was skeptical. i m honestly really hoping that roiland gets brought back to r and m and that things will get better for him. and to all the people who instantly believed the accusations  you are the reason why situations like these keep happening where people are getting falsely accused of things they didn t do and having their life in jeopardy  and you should all be absolutely ashamed of yourselves.so yeah. happy weekend
to get a conviction you need to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. in the eyes of public opinion a smoking gun is enough. just ic was terrible to work with that s why he was fired. wether he s guilty of a crime or not.
as the god of war.. i need shrimp egg foo young and chicken wings
hey melonie! it s good to see you again. you look amazing today! o       o
yeah  but  his grooming texts with a 15-year-old seem to be real. i still think he s sus.
oh man  he s going to  be extra cynical and sarcastic now! sweeet!
failed  his career is ruined over nothing. that s a complete success.
justin roiland is an artist  and he helped create rick   morty  he isn t a robot  he is a person who has to deal with reality.  i saw five seasons of multidimensional weirdness  and it is so unique that i haven t seen anything like that before.  he was attacked by feminism that all men are toxic  and this is discrimination.  his ex likely wanted more money  and there is no more.  divorces in this modern united states breaks men  they are scary  the men are automatically slandered as stupid and animalized as fred flintstones.  johnny depp saw the problem  when amber heard came back for more  seven years after the divorce  while practicing extortion  and he would rather be seen as a drug addict than a wife beater.  heard burned down his nest without a single police report and a seven year time lapse  the lack of evidence is compelling  because she is slander .  she even did the divorce weird  she gave the seven million dollars divorce settlement to charity  while depp paid the taxes.  this is how the rich avoids higher tax brackets  it is a write-off.  depp was married for fifteen months to a uncaring shrew  who misused his money to signal being wealthy  and then didn t like him.  depp s example is that women also need to be held accountable for being in the marriage  because it isn t a master-slave relationship  where it takes two people to make the marriage happen  you do it for the marriage  not for feelings  because as soon as someone is sad  they are going to the divorce.
if you look at the wording  saying he s  innocent  is about as accurate as saying he was  guilty . not enough evidence to prove either way. and things are curiously worded. but since i m not in the know  i don t really care to assume either way.that said  yeah  people just love jumping to conclusions even after time and time again it s shown to be a stupid idea lol
will they put him back on his projects  i highly doubt it.
first of all  16 is the age of consent in some states. second of all  sending private messages to a 16 year old is not illegal  even if they re sexually suggestive. i have no idea what those dms were supposed to be evidence of.
i sincerely hope justin gets his job back. it is now reasonable to me that if he isn t brought back  that i will no longer watch the show.
cancel culture is the dystopian world we live in.
the standard of proof is much higher for a criminal case than it is for an hr department.just because he was found  not guilty  does not mean he didnt commit the alleged crimes.
or they don t think it matters  until they get canceled themselves
it failed as in  it was wrong lol
@melonie mac go boom  maybe i m conflating cancel culture with just malicious accusations. if by  cancel culture has failed  you mean that the accusations were incorrect and the failure is in their assumption they were accurate  then sure  but the accuser has lost him his position and job simply on an accusation. it doesn t seem like the accuser has failed to achieve anything  especially since he would have likely been dropped from the show due to their fear of the potential effect of cancel culture  whether or not the accusations turned out to be accurate
proof

because he was driving little remote car in office
shush.
thank you so much  andrew!
okay sure  the domestic case was a lie by his ex . but it still doesn t change the fact that justin roiland was still inappropriate towards minors ..
melonie    i have a stalker situation  lol.  room is lit like a horror set- also melonie.
i read the thumbnail wrong i read it as stop punching people
i want to see the lying women who make these false claims get their comeuppance.
i hope he leaves those projects and they all fail.  rick and morty is a shell of itself without him.  hopefully he continues his career without those shows.
i don t really have to say anything on the topic...so here s one for the youtube algorithm.oh and yes  cancel culture is one of the greates evils of today.
don t watch the show at all but hopefully he gets a good payout suing for false firing
or they go along and blow things out of proportion  just to frustrate the normies
will they give justin back his job
i hope he sues them too kingdom come!
yeah it came out it appears that the screenshot dm has no real source.   it s a anonymous person source. . fake.
unfortunately innocent until proven guilty doesn t exist anymore unless you are part of   a marginalized community
i had a feeling he was innocent on the charges. but his dms with those minors  yuck...
i m done with rick and morty  adult swin said they were gonna continue the show but you can t continue the show when he voices the 2 main characters and another of other side characters  plus he writes the show with that other woke hack.
glad to hear you didn t get the jab.
how come you don t follow him  lol
but he still won t get his jobs back at rick and morty or squanch games.
okay i love melonie mac she s freaking awesome but does it piss anyone else off every time she says  unalive themself . like i know why she has to say that but it just gets to me for some reason
justin roland basically lost everything even though he s innocent. how can you say cancel culture failed  society has failed to uphold the whole innocent until proven guilty load of garbage. i hope he sues adult swim for wrongful termination.
oh yeah.. i mean look at what happened towards vic mignogna..
probably not  but he can make his own show.
new voice sounds like him but doesn t have that energy.
it sounds like that political fly and rick mixed together.
that was a mistake on his part but he was just joking. and girls can be horrible. they could not wait to destroy him which didn t work. am i right morty. oh  jeez idk. yes  i am  ahahahahahaha.
@orphan of kos.  well i hope the funny hahas were worth his career lol.the man is old enough to have common sense about dming kids about becoming prostitutes and sex slaves.
he needs to be the next person to get an apology and his job back.
@john durham  blame the people who pretended to be his friend along with the person who started all this as well..
i don t watch rick and morty so this is from an impartial observer.  we never heard what evidence that was against him.  so when the case fizzles out like this i can only guess that it was a bunch of nothing.
hold up  wait a minute. somethin  ain t right. lolthat somethin  ain t our m m though  she was right. gather all available facts  discuss  then make a call. don t be so quick to persecute people  even your enemies. next time it might be you or someone you care about.
they tried so hard to make people believe justin roiland had little to no involvement in rick and morty. only a moron would believe that. i m not a rick and morty fan but i know enough about justin roiland s style to know that is almost 100  him lol. they tried to act offended about a drawing of a giant  on a whiteboard in the writers room about a show that features giant   s and buttholes lol.
and also lost out on saquatch games
believe all w m nnnn!!
this still doesn t mean he s a good person. pretty disgusting dude if you ask me.
justin is going to sue the fuck out of cartoon network but sadly the text justin sent to those 15yr olds are real
i mean  i can t stand rick and morty or its writers  but yeah.  this metoo stuff is just a weapon to depose rivals and people in the way of power.  the actual monsters are never busted.  but on the converse  just because the legal case was thrown out is not proof he s innocent  either.
great melonie mac go boom co-creator
he s said he s attracted to 14 year old girls
the only thing i want from women is distance and it s not my fault.
those dms aren t 100  factual
i don t agree that women are the weaker vessel. they have so much more to give than most males can in many areas. tenderness  loving  caring  cratively. of course they wont have the same physical strength as most males. but they have just as much to give.
cancel culture is no different than mao s abolishment of  the four olds.  the thing is in time it turns on its own.
in it for a dollar
so i went through 10 minutes of this and i come to the conclusion that you didn t go through any of the text messages with minors. this is all related to his one tweet after one case has been dismissed. so again i m like the johnny depp trial where he actually was fully innocent and really didn t do anything in that case and wasn t talkin to minors justin has been talking to multiple miners and still has yet to answer for it. we also don t have it fully confirm that these are deepfakes or not however the x talking about this one ordeal and it being innocent is just one case and the others need to be rectified before we understand whether he s fully innocent. so both parties are stupid here don t say oh well good job cancel culture you failed your job when it s not over yet. the other aisle is just as bad just keep playing the middle ground like the first video. be like jeremy thequartering
yoo when you going to start streaming again i need my games and church sermon
guy is still a creeper imo
commenting to feed the algorithm
yup  all it takes is allegations and you lose everything.  innocent until proven guilty  my ass!
he didn t assaulted them
also girls can play innocent and they can be horrible inside
you never know
i address this at the end of the video  p
@melonie mac go boom  lol i asked before i fully watched the vid thanks hope things get figured out for you and the best of luck
why is that
@yu lee  some of the dms and other things not related to the case
@akiko hayami  i remember hearing about that
welcome to  equality  and the  metoo era. guilty until proven innocent.
keep us well  get
i don t want to support justin roland because of what he said about girls on his podcast and all the creepy dms i think cancel culture won because he ain t got no job no more hell he doesn t have his game company anymore
metadata is important
...take all rumours and accusations with a grain of salt...
so are we supposed to say good for him he didn t beat his wife  those messages he sent to children are still out there.
what about the minors
tbh  jr is pretty much done w r m. the whole show has gone down hill since s3  and it will never be as good as it was in its hay day. especially w  dan harmon associated w it
i don t really know about this  issue  nor do i really care  but i am super amused at all these armchair intellectuals who believe any accusation is true just because someone posted screenshot of message exchange... which was super easy to fake even like 20 years ago. it literally proves nothing.
could you say hello to a brazilian fan
od go on a suing tour
but wasn t there something about him texting an underage girl
love you
see  mel was right. you have to think before you jump into any conclusions before you act.
melanie what is wrong with you
new hair
what about the alleged conversation on twitter with that underage fan
those texts were weird tho
if you can t stand by your word  your word is meaningless. anonymity is for cowards.
rick and morty is the ultimate loser here. will people flock back to them after they dropped him like a bad habit like this
guilty  punished  reputation tarnished  until proven innocent..or not found guilty.
@ant-metal  even being found not guilty sometimes isn t enough.
you are telling the truth 999999999999999999999999999999
cool but we all know you don t actually care about rick   morty.
justice.
rick and morty is inherently grotesque and anti christ. im glad to see it gone.
what a beautiful marxist woman!
he was still sending texts to an underage girl.

innocent   since when is he innocent lol
i turned off the video when you mentioned the bible. the atheist in me is too strong xd
eeeeaattt ssshhhii sjws and cancel culture. go justin! sue adult swim now!
cancel culture doesn t exist. never has.
i bet that you re a lot of fun at parties.
@chainsaw subtlety  i also name the jew o  . weimar conditions require final solutions
who  melonie
@telethea the end bringer  yes
i mentioned that in this video. there hasn t been any proof that i am aware of that those weren t fake dm s
@harry baggins  impossible to know unless the victim or someone who knows about the texts speaks out if they are indeed real. you cant presume someone did something with such flimsy evidence.
if the cases were dropped  he wasn t found guilty. if he s not found guilty  they either need to find facts that prove his guilt  without a doubt  or just let him go.
beyond reasonable doubt exists dude.
the demon in you must be strong indeed if it bothers you that much
@melonie mac go boom  demons are just fantasy  so i don t know what you mean. i agree with everything else in the video.
