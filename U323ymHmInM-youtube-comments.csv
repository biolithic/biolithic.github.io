it s insane we re not allowed to express our own thoughts. the twitter mob is ridiculous
levi s a straight up dude  he s been super open about his struggles with mental health  and it sounded severe enough to where i m sure he s used medication. there s a truly dark side to those meds and big pharma s exploitation of the mental health crisis that influenced his outcry.
good on him. he needs to stand his ground and not cave to the mob because they ll just make it worse if he does. and we need to support him because he s going to need it right quick
people aren t forever lost.  they can still be redeemed.  love your videos melonie!
zachary levi is a great dude. i think he was a great shazam and i can t wait to see his next movie!
as a father of 2 girls  your videos give me hope for their future. keep it up!
zach is based. and i believe he s a christian. hey melonie. it s great your talking about this. you look great. hope your doing well.
i originally started watching you for the gaming and pop culture content. i m now following you for your unabashed christian content. don t let the haters get to you. you are a light set on a hill!
there won t be a shazam 3  so it s not like he s risking anything at this point. still  it s good to see more and more people speaking out.
they just want to cancel him and are looking for an excuse to do so. simple as that. solid take  melonie.
thank you   melonie. you are right  some of the world doesn t want the truth because it makes them uncomfortable with in and with their peers. i look forward to your videos.
i m glad you re pushing back  christians take it on the chin too much without saying anything. good on zachary for communicating how he really feels on an issue.
you re so awesome  you and nf are my two favorite christian influences i can go to on youtube during a rough time. you deserve a little something in return for being so real and helping improve my day. thank you and great video as always. bless you and have an awesome day.
keep up your work sister. those who hate are outnumbered by those who show you love and respect for bringing these dark issues to light. stay strong
what a sad world we live in where we can t have an opinion without being ostracised. good on him!
what you are doing @melonie mac is easily the most loving you can do this age. keep going boom!
you go girl. you should love everybody just not everybody ways
i was already planning to see shazam  fury of the gods  but now i ll go see it more than once. first one was awesome
thank you for that speech at the end  really something i needed to hear.
i m honestly so glad you re doing this! especially because you re a woman  it will make it harder for the others woke to use the   incel   excuse and whatnot. keep it up!
it s about controlling the narrative  using groupthink
i was gonna say the same thing. what a scary time we live in! independent thought equals good bye employment  wth!
because people respond to them. and give them power.
what do you mean a  we re  these people don t determine what i say or what you say your reaction to their outrage should simply be to tell them to piss off.
you re only controlled in your thoughts if you let them control you.
that s why i never got on any medication when going through depression.
amen! thank you
@meloniemacgoboom  you re welcome.  keep up the positivity and spreading the good word!
sadly that cant happen till those companys grow a spine and stop bending the knee to people who dont even buy their stuff to start with
he s literally the main reason i even care about shazam.
hey shazam is definitely going to be good part 2 is going to do what one was supposed to do i just got done watching black adam so we might get something at the end of this film leading to that
@christopherloyd8938  that would be nice for black adam to make a surprise appearance.
given that it s ponysmasher directing and not some big hollywood director. i think he ll be somewhat okay.
we ve tolerated enough.
dirk benedict ftw !
ahh thank you so much  this really means a lot!
@meloniemacgoboom  you re very welcome. there ll be more where that came from!
who s nf
@tmansdc9  he s a christian rapper  should check him out. he doesn t rap about gospel  but personal struggles.
thank you so much  god bless
@meloniemacgoboom  you are most welcome       god bless you too
i loved the first shazam ive been excited for the second movie ever since. its one of the few very well made dc movies that has no politics no pandering just pure enjoyment and good writing good acting. i saw that one in theaters multiple times i m going to do that with this one as well most likely
bless you
zachary levi has come out before i m almost positive as being a christian back when he was on the show chuck. thank you for bringing back the christian talk melanie. god bless you and your family and friends. duane.
levi needs to come out as something trendy asap to save his hide or it s curtains.
it is never too late to come to the truth. the important part for those of us who have known all along is to welcome those who are  late to the party .
your best videos are when you share what the bible teaches. keep up the good work!
way to stand for christ sister! great content and much respect to zach
love what you are doing keep it up and god bless
amen god bless you and keep up the gospel truth and keep preaching the word on your channel as a minister myself melonie mac it s refreshing to see god bless you
i ll have to watch his movie now to support him
the hell  he is the sweetest guy. it s sickening with all these drones that go through hoops to protect the v-process. and his comment wasn t bad at all  guess he didn t have the one  only acceptable thought!
ur definitely a sight for sore eyes. we need more like u. thank for all ur videos.
thanks for bringing some church to this video! it seems like it s harder every day to be a christian - but it always was. and that doesn t mean that we give up. your sermon at the end inspired me to pick up my bible and read proverbs 24. i gotta say  i try every day to read the bible but some days i slip... like today! so now i got melonie mac s voice in my head telling me to pick up my bible before i pick up my phone  start work  or do anything else... because god always comes first. god bless you  my sister in christ  you re in my prayers.
i ve been a fan of zachary levi since he was in chuck  and all the more glad he s a christian. i have no doubt he knew what he was getting into with that comment  he s made a few before  so i won t be surprised to see more stuff like this from both of you. way to go bringing the word on this stuff!
i don t do the video game vids but again i love these mini bible studies videos! thanks!
thanks! always appreciate you talking about the bible in your videos.
lol. i wouldn t even say he is cancelled. they can try  but as long as you ignore them  they really can t do anything.
really appreciate hearing more freethinking going on. actor  doctor  astronaut. i like to hear it. especially after more evidence coming out showing the dangers unprecedented
his movie is going to make so much this year!
good for him!!
he didn t even make the statement about the shot  just about pfizer in general. the question is   how much time does zachary levi spend on social media    if not much  then he is making the most out of life.
zach is too real for the wokies!
non binary is the easiest one lol!
you re the best  thank you!
ignore those haters you are here now doing what you are called to do for a reason. seek the gathering and find and keep strength. i m glad i found this channel. good job
even when it comes to adults who can make their own decisions...i find encouraging people to cut off parts of their body in an attempt to reconcile with their mental illness is just as abhorrent as allowing children to do so with the approval of their parents.
zachary levi will always be chuck bartowski.
just finished watching the stream that i have been looking for  for a week- since jay accidentally teased me on rumble. tomorrow i ll start full carnivore. it s been 3 years since i quit smoking   i was just guaging my internals earlier this morning thinking  now is the time to start pushing harder . thanks for the advice
i knew there was a reason i liked that movie  and i m not usually one for those cape flicks
still jab-free and kicking!
putting people  or groups of people  on blast for doing dumb stuff doesn t mean you hate them  just means that you care enough to help point them in a better direction. i mean it is obviously about how you approach it. catch more with honey than with vinegar.
remember when the left was against big pharma  pepperidge farm remembers
how can they cancel chuck  no one is safe lol
people want to put jesus in this hippie box that s the greatest thing i ve heard in a while.   and it s true!!  i ve got to remember that one and use it.  bravo mel  bravo.
good on him  and thx for the sermon i enjoyed them both.
i know that some studio contracts or production companies require their stars to promote their projects on social media.  but ffs  i d just delete all my socials if i was a celebrity.  it seems like no matter how much you keep your opinion to a minimum  someone will dig through your old shit  or any shit   just to shove it in the world s face out of sheer boredom.  also  it really sucks that he can t have a damn opinion.
another great video!  many thanks for sharing.  cheers!
hey melonie  would you mind doing a video on recommendations for what you use for food  currently i m looking for a dehydrator for making jerky and move away from eating snacks from the store. with how many dehydrators there are and how many are multi use  i wanted to go to the source of the idea for me. since i was curious about this  i m sure others are curious about other tools and items you use for other foods. thank you
happy monday melonie mac!
now see i actually really liked his performance as shazam  and aside from the first wonder woman movie  it was the only other dc movie i actually enjoyed  because it was colorful and fun  but also had some heavy stuff in there. i was wondering why they hadn t brought him back  but they also got rid of henry cavill and gal godot so who tf knows....
i appreciated hearing all the terms used in this video that i only thought the quartering used.  good highlight video.
zackery came out as christian like 5 years ago  honestly not surprising considering this.
i don t really trust zach mostly because he was defending james gunn. that being said i don t support him being canceled.
veritas is doing god s work.
they won t be putting him in that hippie box when he comes back.
@nerdicwarrior8920  what   said when he returns  there won t be a box big enough for anyone to either try to put him in or hide themselves in.
haha we have to get creative not to get demonetized
@meloniemacgoboom  by the way  i also appreciate your genuine attitude as a christian.  youtube definitely needs more people who want to walk with the lord.  keep up the great work.
i really hope he doesn t eventually kneel.
getting canceled is the best thing that can happen to his career since james gunn
i totally agree with zachary levi
hey melanie  what are your thoughts on the anti-woke mob down voting last of us ep3 because it includes gay characters  who were also gay in the source material   do you approve of conservative cancel culture fueled by conservative identity politics
been a fan of zachary levi since chuck. great to know he s not a typical hollywood leftist. i wonder what this means for the future of the shazam movies  oh  and  checked  he is absolutely a christian  and a  imported  texan like you  melonie
melonie mac boom respected these actors and actress
it will come to a point where they cancel themselves
16 50 isn t it paul that said  everything is permissible  but not everything is beneficial
i think this could be a new pr tactic by hollywood
awesome!we get to start another week with a great melonie mac video. hope you re having a fantastic day  melonie. you re looking super cute.
hope he stands his ground.
love you  mel.keep going.....
i think it s funny that this guy played a doctor in  the marvelous mrs. maziel
why do we allow these people to do this to folks who don t agree with them
i just want to say 2 things about your video here  1. women are not weaker than men. women are physically weaker than men. but  otherwise  women are equal to men.and 2. the first shazam! movie is actually a lot more christian than it seems. rewatch it  sometime. it s really good. and you can tell zachary is having a lot of fun in it.
the left   we must call out big corp corruption! the left during the pandemic   i love big pharma how dare you!
you go girl! get em! it s crazy how the left doesn t want an honest conversation but complete silence of other views and complete acceptance and compliance of their view.
i m gonna go see it... zack be damnedi think he be a nice dude
chuck is my boi for life.
george carlin once said fear of germs and people panicking and scrubbing this and spraying that and over cooking their food and repeating washing their hand trying to avoid all contacts with germs it s ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths
to be fair pv did just show zach how corrupt fizer is
so the twitter mob is allowed to share their opinions and views but other cannot share different views and opinions. ok. lol
preach it  girl.
another epic video!
it s true  we were instructed to tolerate sin. all these people who say intolerance is a bad thing  or actually intolerant themselves. and tolerance is a good thing  it s what keeps us from going the wrong way.
we just need to stay true to ourselves and they will disperse like a mist in a cold morning...
i dont think they can do much to him. shazam is one of the few very good dc movies and zachary levi is a big part of that. shazam 2 is one of the only dc movies im looking forward for. dc needs to hold onto everything they can hold onto thats actually  good
glad to see twitter has not changed in the slightest. i guess all those twits making videos of themselves leaving twitter was pointless.
sad that we live in theses times
if you can save one soul for god with what you say don t let the non believers get you down god bless.
meonie don t forget to hydrate my love. you are such a breath of fresh air
i hope some of his co-stars come to his defense as a good person. when chris pratt was attacked for being a christian mark ruffalo gave a weak defense saying he was a good person to everyone he was around. he took some hit on twitter for it. robert downey jr went off saying these trolls need to get out of their parent s basements and start contributing to society.
pfizer on that umbrella type shit  no joke
veritas  latest video fortunately gives more confidence in the big pharma
i enjoyed this video a lot tbh
why don t you ever review games like the dead space remake or forspoken   since you were talking about the games beforehand  it only makes sense that you would follow it up with full  final thoughts on them after they release.  and especially talk about whether or not your predictions were correct.
once again! preach on preacha!!!
are we all really that surprised that charles irving bartowski would say this
ironic he s being cancelled after kinda shunning depp during the trial
i can t hear his voice without thinking of arcade gannon from fnv
they ll replace him with a diverse trans woman
i don t do game reviews on this channel  i report on nerd culture news. if you want my opinions on games after i play them  you can watch my streams on twitch. i always share my opinions there.
@meloniemacgoboom  understandable.  it just seems like a logical next step to review a game after you gave thoughts on it before it released.
i love it when you talk churchy to me!
happy monday melonie and thoughts on forspoken being outsold by the dead space remake thought
yes  we are called to be peace makers not keepers
this was a good take from him. too bad he s been licking the boots of hbo max.
hardcore agree with you.
my husband and i were forced to get the jab or else we d lose our jobs. we re struggling to conceive right now and i can t bear to think it might be because of the jab. i really really hope not.
in australia the state governments all forced work jab mandates on basically nearly every industry even outside health   as i m typing this i m hearing ambulance sirens whizz by  almost everyday like it s the norm now  and the results i m seeing are horrific  it s like my gov has willingly  allegedly  committed democide  my ex-university lecturer now has pericarditis and two in my family now have cancer  in the us i know biden tried to force it but good on the us supreme court for overturning it.
i ve lost one old classmate and another acquaintance bro of mine under unknown conditions that suddenly died.  jab  no jab....me with 3 comorbidities and over 50 had the wuhan flu with no lasting  effects.
friendship with the world is enmity with god. it s in the bible  dang straight.the best you ll get from the more  progressive  types is along the lines of  we should love everyone  and not be judgmental. . . it s in the bible  or something and yes  the lord has overcome the world! amen!
pfizer doing umbrella corp. moves
sorry i got here late. i generally don t care if people hate me. that s their problem. i respect people that i care about whether i know them or not. for example-i don t know melonie personally but i always  remind her to drink water. you don t have to do anything big. just make it important to someone. live life. help others. sorry this kind of went on.stay safe. take care. have fun.
when are you playing hogwarts  want to watch to endorse the game.
what do you think  who will be the next  you!   and you!    you!    you!    you!    you!   and youuuuuuuu!
i am a genetic cesspool. high risk for pretty much everything. disabled  chronically ill  chronic pain  you name it. and my health issues are my problem. no one else s. my responsibility. that s why i never endorsed a mandate. sure  i would encourage people to consider it and discuss the option with their doctor to determine if it were a good option for them  but i am not their pcp. it was not akin to a tested  tried and true childhood vax that has proven benefits  either. it was a gamble. and i get that not everyone wants to gamble with their health.
let them be mad its pure entertaining n music 2 our ears lol
17 35 - says she doesnt like people getting offended by her jokes and doesnt enjoy people getting a rise out of her  only to purchase a hogwarts legacy video game to get a rise out of said people...
preach
i wonder how many times those people have said my body my choice.
memories of nano-seconds
hi melonie happy monday i hope you are still doing well.
that s not even remotely a surprise haha
i m so sorry! i will be praying for y all that you can conceive and live in good health
@meloniemacgoboom  thank you  melonie. i really appreciate you
playing it on launch day of the deluxe edition  will stream on twitch!
@meloniemacgoboom  i ll be there   can t wait for the game .
she s playing the  ultra genocide  edition.
xd
based  thank you
i bought it because i wanted to play it and to support the devs and jk rowling. it s pretty funny that people get mad over it tho ngl  that one is ludicrous lol
only when it s convenient to them
a lot of people are fighting on that hill now because they re terrified  they ve pumped themselves full of goof juice that is going to end their life.
god bless you melonie  great message. consider bringing back a bible verse in some of your videos
they should be upset with ezra miller  not zachary.
love when you lay down some religion!
when conspiracy theories prove to be true
i didn t know there were christian  female game commentators who know what they re talking about. haha i subscribed today.
blessed are you when they insult you and persecute youand utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me.rejoice and be glad for your reward will be great in heaven.
anyone else here wish he d walk away from dcu and go join cavill on his next project
kindof a cringe theology video by the end  but overall a good watch    good on zachary levi for standing up to the mob
1000   agree
attacked fit having not confidence in getting stabbed overall he seems prtty chill
love didn t stop christ from chasing the money changers out of his fathers house with a whip. you can spank your kid and still love them.
my boy arcade gannon.
let s keep fighting the good fight  the battles ahead. this our calling. to the frontlines of this spiritual war. may the woke be awakened. if not  well  then they can just go back to sleep
this is one of the cutest girls i ve seen. yes i am simping sue me
i ve loved zachary levi ever since he did chuck and the woke cancel culture needs to be cancelled once and for all
levi s a conservative too  let s get him and adam baldwin back together and see if we can find some show for them on the daily wire or something.
i think bob iger has something to do with this.
it is not love to ignore or even turn a blind eye to behavior that you believe is truly spiritually damaging or even damming to an individual. if my son were doing something self destructive i would not be a loving father if i turned my back on that and let it go unchallenged. people can disagree with christian principles all they want but if you aren t even willing to take a stand for what you truly believe is right then that s not love  that s apathy. the important thing is to do it out of a sincere spirit of love for the other person or else it is meaningless.  1 corinthians 13 1-3 keep on keeping on mel.
the real captain marvel.
thank you so much  i appreciate it! i ve addressed this a few times already  but rather than rush a verse for every video i prefer to speak when god places something on my heart instead
right  god bless sister melonie
facts!
aw thank you
they continually stand on lies because absolute truth is found in christ. they lean on their own righteousness and wisdom. that is why christians are instructed to lean on god for everything.
if melonie took a page from chrissie mayr and created an frosk-esque alter ego  what would she be like  perhaps she drank from the jekyll and hyde formula  and turned into a blue haired member of the outrage mob named  melonie pc.  sigh  i m sorry everybody  i m very bored.
don cheadle should have been fired for the way he treated the shuri actress.
it s funny how us christians get a lot of hate  but if we were to say one bad thing about any other religion  you get called anti-whatever the religion is ex antisemitic. what a world we live in where it s freedom of religion unless you re christian  then screw you.
remember when people could separate the art from the artist  yeah me neither.
i m so sick of constant outrage culture  and while the far left are the ones doing it more at this moment  i don t like it when the far right does it as well. sanity  folks. it s ok to live and let live. it s ok to disagree with people. it s ok not to make a mountain out of every molehill.
well  if he supports trump  that is a fair basis to doubt a person s devotion to christ.just like if you believe homosexuality is fine  that is a fair basis to doubt your devotion to christ.
cancellers keep cancelling.
nah see i agree with a vast majority of what you re saying  but saying people don t listen to facts when you believe in the bible being the word of god is very hypocritical. the bible is not word for word god s message. it is a man written book. the holier than thou calling out sin nonsense does far more harm than helpful  because it s not based in logical sense. christianity and most other religions have done far more harm to humanity than good  let s get that straight. you cannot sit here and talk about facts when you believe the bible lol  seriously. it s the actual definition of being hypocritical. you believe just like they do in your specific beliefs  but beliefs aren t facts all the time  and you need to call yourself out on that  or else you are no better than the person you are criticizing. it renders your argument in this fairly nonsensical  and that is just factual by definition. whatever type of way you were feeling definitely made it into this video and that s fine  but do not try to pass it off as some mic drop of spittin facts. religion is about as factual as a man cutting off his balls and calling himself a woman. again  i like your content and you make a ton of great points usually but you re letting your belief system and personal feelings dictate the point you re trying to make and you re acting exactly like the people you re trying to refute
if you re going to play a video clip you gotta check sound  it s so quiet
melonie  you didn t give details on exactly what levi is objecting to. thumbs down. as for getting vaccines  there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that vaccines are an extremely good idea. i am a scholar  dammit. i have a psychology degree  and i study medicine as a hobby  along with some other subjects. objecting is silly  and i say this as a person who had adverse reactions to the covid vaccine.
i ve had four pfizers  and i feel great.
this is going to turn into  don t go see fury of the gods or you ll be a genocidal terf
have you play dead space remake yet. because it came now  and i hope you make a video of it  soom.
it s stupid that the word  christian  is considered derogatory these days.like  why
thank you.
those who want to put jesus in the hippie box are intolerant of anyone who disagrees with their  tolerance .
shazam !
once a sycophant have tasted the mead of being one  there is no turning back. what entered without reason will not come out with reasoning.
dc -  oh he disagreed and thinks against something we are for.... fire him!!! erza burglarized  kidnapped  and assulted  600  fine!!!
my alter ego would be full on yandere yuno gasai style  but that s kind of just an extreme version of me already ngl lol!
@meloniemacgoboom  melonie  today is my birthday  and none of my family or friends could get together with me  and i ve been sitting here at home very depressed. you ve lifted my spirits today twice  once here and once over on the drunk threepio stream. god love ya  dear lady
a mans written book inspired by the word of god john 1 1 i hear a lot of anti christianity but not a lot of facts just emotion historians have proved jesus walked the earth
my cousins got it and her entire body was shutting down was hospitalized for a long time will pass
@dunhoppe2002  malarkey.
famous last words
i heard you transcend life after your 5th pfizer  can you find out if this is true for me
melonie is shooting her shot
i have gotten my boosters of covid vaccines and i feel 100  fine
i got coof 2 times and survived no vaccines.
people are so insane that they are standing up for the pharmaceutical industry. what complete fools.
sin  is subjective  just don t hurt others.
what s the song she plays at the end
commenting to feed the algorithm
hey melonie sorry for this being late but i just want to tell you that i don t know why the mob have to ruined the movie stars. anyway i also think that zac levi is a great person and a christian and i don t know why mob people have to go and destroy the celebrities and be mean to them if they don t even know who they really are in person. anyway i do wish that god would touch these mob people and change their lives and have them stop being mean to celebrities and just leave them alone for once. anyway i just want to tell you that and make a comment on your video from yesterday  monday  and i just want to tell you that you did a great job with the interview with jay on his drunk3po streaming show last night. anyway i like to watch you and listen to you talk about stuff on streaming shows. anyway i just wanted to tell you that and i just want to tell you that you are doing a fantastic job with making these videos for us fans and hope you continuing to do a great job with these videos everyday and every month and year  ok melonie. anyway great job  melonie. anyway hope you had a great day yesterday  monday  and hope you continuing to have a great blessed day today  tuesday  at home today melonie. god bless you and god bless your hard work that you do for us your fans. anyway have a great day melonie.
everybody is offended by everything
not a christian  but i m definitely on y all s side on this one.
thanks!
so everyone s just gonna forget he pandered to the w0ke  like  last year  he s not some chad  he said one thing that was correct. he s gonna need to put his money where his mouth is to prove he s changed.
is this an op channel
melanie mac is going to save the women.
y all take that shit so seriously in america
never thought i d say it  but   unfortunately   they re not.in response to the comment  the woke mob... they re still dying on this hill...
hey melonie so honestly i have no interest in shazam to me is one of the worst things dc has. like she hulk from marvel despite the obvious diferences
dwayne johnson fired this guy  lol. karma received on him. poor levi. hopefully this will be over soon.
this is ridiculous
i feel bad for women. they had fought hard to be taken serious and equally and then men put on dresses and took control of all that too
good for you
great to hear it  i hope you continue to live in good health
same just a common cold and a whole lot of prayer went away after 7 days
i thought the left was supposed to be hippies  why are they simping for big pharma and the government ! ! lol!
wrong  sin is not subjective and is clearly laid out in the bible. this whole  morality is subjective  thing is what started this woke bullcrap in the first place
thank you
thank you so much!
what did he say that pandered to the woke  genuine question  i must have missed it
wrong guy

tak!
c mon melonie chill with the god stuff ...i don t come to this channel to go to church
i think  would you travel with a plane with just a 99  chance to survive  but i am not healthy  aswell. my chances would be far worse.but yes  whar they did was harmful. what they created. multiple times. they made it out of epidemic in asia. they made a far more dangerous version a few months ago. and it s not the first time. there were some scandals last century with stuff they tested. in the subway  for example. wanted to test  how something like that could spread. thought  it wouldn t be dangerous. but it was to some people. and that s a danger.becuase the thing that was terrible  was  the first versions were far more dangerous  but less perople were affected. still  a lot got the infection in 2020 21. omikron is far less dangerous. but it can cause awful long term. research goes on. nerves  brain  spinal cord. it s interesting  but not that much known. it s not long enough around. so we don t know about that  but yes  99  survive  but a lot of people were infected  and some multiple times. i know a guy  he had it the 3rd time 8 weeks after it arrived here in germany.and woke being satanic  i am not christian  but for me the term  satanic  has a definition  based on what is described in the bible. so yes  it totally is satanic. the fat acceptance as part of that. deadly sins. they tell especially women  to do that. being angry  being fat and eat  the lust. they are jealous. and how they are always lying  betraying. envy and greed. look at a.h. wrath. and lazyness  mainstream media. for example. or woke employees at big tech. and yes  the pride. everywhere. parades for that. all sorts of pride. so even per definition  100  neutral it totally is satanic. i don t think someone should really have a problem with that. woke promotes being fat  promotes lust  pride  woke people often are lazy and so on. that are the deadly sins. so woke promotes the deadly sins and other stuff. the deadly sins are satanic. so woke culture is satanic. and they are just an example for the values woke promotes that are seen as satanic. if someone says  fat acceptance or pride parades are part of woke culture  he admits with that  woke culture is satanic
i m getting really tired of hearing that word  coof
too little too late
didn t he just lose his pops recently  there s nothing worse than grieving a loss and having a mob bullying you on some bullshit. i ve gotten vaccinated boosted and i m not butthurt over different opinions. everybody has the right to make their choice.
no offense but you are not entitled to someone backing your belief when you wanted to be back. maybe he is under the game plan as to i have my opinion. i m not going to go out of my way to push my opinion if it s going to negatively hurt me but if i m asking my opinion i will tell the truth.
why they do these things is easily understandable  when you bring the word in.... romans 1 28-29   and because they decided in themselves not to know god  god handed them over to a worthless mind so that they would be doing whatever is inappropriate  as they are filled with every injustice and fornication  bitterness  wickedness  greed  envy  murder  contention  treachery and wicked reasoning  .  the us has abandoned god  and now they begin to reap the  consequences.
no why are you guys following him over this.   he is for the shots and works in hollywood so now you all are ok with him because of this.
i mean i still cant go visit my family in the us because of the vaccine entry mandate. you guys are practically the only country left in the world who requires proof of vaccination to enter.
lol who tf supports pfi zer

oh no!!!! not a christian conservative i m hollywood
i don t agree with your religious views i m going to get you cancelled .seriously though whilst i am not religious you are  entitled to your views and that s the way the world should be  live and let live .one thing we do share in common is distain for woke. the woke agenda is dangerous especially for women and girls .recent case here in uk male rapist decides to identify as transgender during trial gets sent to womens prison fortunately after massive backlash it was reversed. but how can anyone think in the 1st place that putting a sexual predator in a prison full of females is the right thing to do .woke is devoid of common sense and conscience .and any one that is prepared to stand up and call it out deserves praise and gets my backing
first  perhaps
melonie you undercut your argument about the left ignoring facts when you veer off into theology randomly in the middle of your videos.
good riddance! go woke get cancelled by woke !
then go to another channel bro  you re not gonna tell me what to talk about on my own channel i know that much.
take that up with youtube s censorship team then lol
@meloniemacgoboom  youtube censorship can rot in the damn fire for all i care
is he being cancelled or does he just have a bunch of people calling him out  theres a difference  stop being hysterical
troll alert
