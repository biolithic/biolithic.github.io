you hit the nail on the head. I am a believer as well  and I want to thank you for standing up for the Bible and for the true truth. it means a lot to know there are others out there like you.,

I always come here for the hilarious reactions and then stay for the well spoken truth. well said  melonie.,

you were preaching during that last part. Imean that in a good way. all you said was truth. and entertainment aside  a lot of this stuff is spiritual  and you broke that down in a very simple and common sense way to understand. Im sure even people who may not even know the Bible that well may understand the simple points you were making in contrast to the faulty issues of the other agenda.,

hey melanie I usually dont comment but I have to say that this segment actually made me proud but in a healthy way Im just glad youre standing up for the Bible and his word. I agree with everything you said about the Bible and how basically the left is doing everything that is opposite of. do youremember this quote  you just do you   all that loving yourself talk and promotion is the downgradation of american society we are all now teaching ourselves how to be our own God basically really really sad one of the first things I learned after being saved is you give up of yourself you have to grow smaller and God to grow bigger to make an impact on yourself and the world keep the faith girl we are as Christians being attacked as bigots racist or whatever they want to call us keep on fighting the good fight Jesus loves you
great points. marvel has almost become a parody of itself... sidenote  doing something different with your makeup  I like it. its on point!,

you have a good message  you can make a change I wish you luck young lady.,

way to stand up for your faith in Jesus and your love for the Bible! this elevated my respect for you and your channel!,

pretty great tangent imo. got some flashbacks to when you ended on Bible verses  which I always enjoyed .,

@melonie mac go boomÂ  Im not a Christian  but I respected your readings and was interested in your opinions of it,

I walked away from my faith for a time  learned a big lesson the hard way. if you were a believer before then God will bring you back in if you listen. Im sure one day you 
will  just as I did. when I returned to my faith I had lots of things I was still unsure about  but I chose to surrender and have faith. God has revealed a lot to me and answered many of those questions  and I know I will get answers to more as I continue my journey. some questions Imay never know until I see heaven  but thats ok. faith is a fundamental part of Christianity. Im so beyond grateful to be back in my faith  and one day if you find God again you will be too.,

and good for you for realizing the reality and strengthening your faith in the face of it all.  keep growing stronger and better and healthier melonie!,

I admire the way you preach your faith. may God bless you and may he bring you joy  happiness and prosperity. mike,

thank you so much for living out your faith and not being ashamed to share your moral values.  its so easy to let others bully you because of your faith  but to not let those individuals affect your life shows true strength.  great job!
