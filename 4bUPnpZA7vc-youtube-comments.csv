it baffles me how a person can groom a child and that s fine but somehow johnny depp and henry cavill are the problem.
why did kang get the boot immediately yet ezra is still employed  frankly  what ezra did seems significantly worse than kang s alleged crimes.
10 seconds in   non-binary  they them ain t real. and now i hit the like button.   and just hope the rest of the video is good enough to also deserve it.
wb lets henry cavill go as superman and allows ezra miller to keep his job and gets to star in the new flash movie. bravo wb bravo.
there s nothing in the world that will convince me to watch this movie. the dude belong in jail. he shouldn t be making any movies based upon his actions in the past and i wouldn t be surprised if he keeps up his shenanigans. great video today melonie! love your shirt and god bless you today!
in hollywood s mind people  primarily men  can do whatever they want as long as they don t identify as men.
melonie  i m absolutely overjoyed that all this modern day insanity hasn t corrupted you. keep the content coming and stay smart
when they say non-binary  are they admiting there s a binary
they have actual proof for this dudes insanity. but they dumped jd over an accusation and kept the abuser on. before guilt or innocence was proven.
ezra can groom children and take them. how is this acceptable  . what a decline of civilization
congratulations ezra miller all our middle fingers want to give you a standing ovation!
the entertainment industry has an absolute talent for promoting horrible people  i must admit it s impressive
i ll be honest not even michael keaton is going to get me to see this movie.
the only thing i would even want to see from this movie is batman. and people know batman is one of my all time fav comic book characters. so if some one wanted to make an edited version with just batman and no ezra. i m not going to watch this.  rippaverse
ezra miller is a word that rhymes with boomer  but with a gr-.
to me  the guy that was playing the flash role in the wb tv show is better than ezra miller in every way
like i ve been saying  it should have been grant gustin as the flash in the movies! he is in the series and hes excellent!
so  there are those that say no one could play the flash better than ezra miller. . . . . .two words  grant gustin!
melonie  yesterday s video... you really hit a home run with that one. i mean it. that video  in my opinion  was spirit-filled s-tier level. one of your best you were unflinching. uncompromising. articulate. bold! but most of all  throughout the entire video... you were biblical! you were on fire both doctrinally and spiritually  holding on to the unchanging standards of our unchanging god! i found myself cheering   yes! yes!! thank you!  as you pitched ball after home run ball of truth. you were telling people caught up in the sins of the lgbt   the hard truth they dearly need to hear and take to heart. and even though some people want to give you flak  or claim the bible is  made up ... your heart for god  for truth  and for others lost in sin was on full display yesterday.you were outstanding. i mean that. you were armored up and boldly standing on those front lines like never before. in a way  you remind me of deborah in the bible. deborah is described as being unafraid to stand up for what she believed in  even in the face of opposition... just like you.i would easily put yesterday s video in your top 5 best videos... if not top 3! i don t know what more i can say other than... thank you. thank you  melonie  for all that you do-  both seen and unseen- to make and bring us your content. you really are a blessing
i think  in justice league  his character was written well. i don t think  he is a good actor. not bad  but not good either. it s just  he has woke privilege. and he knows it  he uses it. calls people -phobic. that s known. and what elsexis known  what he is accused of  is disgusting
henry cavill wasnt fired for anything he did wrong. its understandable why he left. they wanted a different take on the character  and man of steel was kinda shit.
@nrn ehigie  no no  the g4 wench frosk went after him for dating a 19 yr old when he was 30   . you know  a consensual relationship between adults about 9 years ago.
@nrn ehigie an of steel is a masterpiece and so is bvs ue and zsjl
socialite
@nrn ehigie  the witcher showrunner said henry cavill was a terrible person and that he was controlling which is why he left
@jonathan diaz  the witcher showrunner never said this but exantly opposite.your fantasy is sick!
what s your opinion on the catholic woman beater. i m talking about mel gibson.
@jonathan diaz  henry is an absolute gamer and he just wanted his show to be like the games. it wasn t  controlling  is game accuracy too much to ask  if they listened to him  they could ve made the show better
all ik is this movie will make a profit regardless  general audience dont know shit about ezra   its mainly the hardcore snyderverse fans that want to see this movie fail. i dont support ezra and if they keep him fuck warner bros but excited to see this movie  ill be there to support the hard work that tons of ppl put into this movie   looking forward to the reboot where we will get more comic book accurate characters not the realistic kind. the general audience wants a dc universe that they can take their kids to and not get bored thats what james gunn will bring    he can still make deep dark stories while also keeping it light just look at the gaurdians trilogy
no one has a problem with henry cavill but henry cavill had a problem with everyone else  rightfully so.
@gloria thomas  i love how you say  catholic  like that s a bad trait in itself.  granted  i m not fond of some things the catholic church does  or did  but i know many good catholic people.  personally  i don t support the things mel says does either  and just because people support henry and depp doesn t mean they automatically support people like gibson.for that matter i don t think people like depp are perfect either  as he said did crappy things too.
@gloriathomas3245 wow  you like to make stuff up don t you
let s not forget what vile things james gunn said in the past  and now  ezra miller is the only one that he has said he s interested in working with from the snyderverse.
we know why...can t say it tho or i m a bigot
they them.  that is why.
@photriuspyrelus  didn t they say majors was innocent already too  i may be misremembering but i m 99  positive they proved him innocent already but have completely fucked his career like they did with johnny depp.
@spaecii  also that one football player.  i don t recall his name  one of the best punters.
@photriuspyrelus  matt araiza  the punt god
@photriuspyrelus  yeahhhh i remember hearing about that too
@spaecii from what i understand  for that situation he was  but then more and more girls started to come forward  so it wasn t his first time doing this.
@lizard81288  ahh  i see  i ll have to look more into it. still horseshit that ezra literally gets to kidnap and hold people ransom but doesn t suffer any consequence.
jonathan majors isn t officially out yet
@1234 flux  gotcha i was confused ab that
alphabet soup
both are crap and belong in jail. the problem is not jonathan majors being punished  it s ezra miller not getting punished.
@spaecii  don t forget years of grooming and the cult.
because wb chose to keep him on. they dont have to fire him
they them has a stronger shield than poc.
exactly so boycott the movie
majors wasent booted and this movie was filmed before he went crazy
@kyle allen  i haven t been following the majors stuff but the director for flash is still saying he doesn t want to recast ezra  although that might just be until the movie has finished its run .
@darth apathy  yea they want him gone. it was just so late in production when he lost his mind that they kinda just had to go with it i guess
i guess marvel has a shorter leash and dc
hypocrisy  my man. it s all about them being hypocritical and inconsistent. that  and just lacking any common sense and decency.
what has he done that so terrible  trump can do 10000x times that and his support would only grow.
you don t get second chances when you are a brother!
flash has dirt on someone  kang doesn t.
to an extent it is real  hermaphroditism and eunuchs are a real thing. not to mention that frog stuff in jurassic park.but the use in the modern era is more psychological than physical and that s where it lost me.
yip they fired a gentleman and role model  yet retained a vile pathetic stain who s attacked multiple women!!!great move wb  great move.
@mcrib prime  most of his crimes were against women. because of they them he gets away with it. seems like the message they want out there is  only cis men aren t allowed to commit crimes against women.
@thatharvguy  my destain for this movie was 100  based on ezra the stain miller  but now it s 99  towards him and 1  towards the director. i generally hope people think very carefully before they provide 1 penny towards the success of this movie  a man who s attacked multiple women portraying a superhero and role model  when he s anything but and there s no way i can contribute to his success or retainment. so i ve made the choice i no longer support dc until he s fired!!
don t forget johnny depp
cavill loved the movie.
wb has been making a lot of poor decisions lately
ezra miller is jewish.
when they don t get punished  they tend to repeat the crimes because in their mind  they did nothing wrong...
sure ezra is terrible i hate that asshole too but if the movie is good and the acting. i will watch it because i may like the movie and i don t care if he is the flash as long as he plays  his role good.
the movie was made already  now why he is given a second chance that is a legetimate question
@thepminlc me to i am seeing it for keaton
@gumpy flyale  i don t get it too they gave him a second chance but get rid of henry cavill
and if there predators
@randomnerd12  capcom  censors games.hollywood  black washing characters i see no difference.
women can even abuse men and get away with it  hollywood huh
@james smith  i heard a story a while back about a woman who locked her 2 kids in the trunk so she could go party  and the 2 kids died in the trunk. and she got found not guilty at her trial. crazy  but that s the satanic world we live in.
@james smith  yep amber heard.
hollywood isn t the dream career everyone plays in their head
@angela milani  yep.
i heard washington d.c. is on his tail
that is insanely accurate
well said  helix. please never change  melonie!
agree
oh stop it  i m sure your favorite actors have done horrible things but you just don t know about it
@nomadangel  why you mad  get a hug and stop crying
they are  ironically. woke leftist ideologies never make any sense
stunning and brave!
hollywoke embraces binary all the time. white is replaced by black.straight is replaced by gay.men are replace by women. this is their go-to for  diversity . only recently have they added some brown and bi  but blackwashing is their primary move.
@thatharvguy and gingers replaced by black.
@alfasilverblade  that s a whole other rant. f f s
there s no meaning to being outside something if you don t reinforce the thing itself lol
i had a similar question  is the  they them  pronouns referring to both genders existing in the same body
@jason brian escobedo  i know that as hermaphrodite  futanari or futa  in japanese . but they seem to ignore them and attack helicopter  yet embrace the 60  genders.
non binary is a paradox. by splitting the genders into a binary category and a non binary category you are creating a binary. which means that non binary is actually not non binary
i am a woman.what is a woman there s no such thing as a woman.
it s even funnier that at surgery they only get two options  male or female.
he s rich
that  is for the courtrooms to decide.
a proctologist ovation. love it!
this movie going to be great
i bet he would love all y all middle fingers to go somewhere
from the latest trailer  repeating soundbites from his batman movies are the highlights. i ll wait for the yt compilation videos.
@thatharvguy  that s just pathetic. they re tearing a page right out of disney s book and playing with fan s nostalgia. smh.
you refuse to watch because of ezra miller  i refuse to watch because it didn t follow the story it based on. so this movie is quite wokeif you guys want to know what happened to flash when he reversed time. i recommend you guys flashpoint animated movie. that animation is pretty faithful to comic.
@bobo boy  ezra is just one of the main reasons i m not watching this one. i ll be honest i think this entire dcu is already dead in the water.
roger that.
@kerry lawson  who is this roger you speak of
how about swap ezra flash with grant gustin
he made it in hollywood and the jealous bug came along
just watched a video where the director said they thought about putting in this movie but they didn t want him to upstage miller.
agreed. she s such an encouragement
agreed brother.
i never get tired of melonie bringing god and the bible into her videos tweets  or anything. i alwasys love that.
false allegations. this isn t the first time cops didn t do anything for people
zack snyder cast every jl member since 2013. snyder also said he didn t know what cast are doing in their real life because he cast them after he watch their performance in previous movie they did.- snyder cast ben because ben looks like batman from the dark knight return graphic novel- snyder cast gal gadot because gal gadot used to be israeli soldier for 2 years- snyder cast jason momoa because people keep making fun of aquaman character- snyder cast ezra miller after he saw his performance in the movie peak of being wallflower- snyder cast amber heard because of her performance with nic cage in a 2011 movie- snyder cast ray fischer after he saw his performance in broadway theater
i just love the fact that a prominent actor with a bright acting career infront of him just decided not to stop committing crime for a uncertain amount of time...that s just funny.
gene wilder said it the best when asked to describe hollywood   yuck.
i can t believe they let erza miller off the hook... he should be held accountable of his actions... i don t care how good of a actor erza miller is... he should be cancelled...
i m still baffled that ezra miller wasn t fired
they re so quick to cancel everyone but when someone pretends to be special by their rule book they ll allow anything huh. ezra is a predator
i truly apologize for how ruined everything is now for young people with their head on straight. i have been watching helplessly and alone since the early  90s
i just have two things to say 1. grant gustin will always be my flash 2. i gotta ask  what s with the giant stick of butter
i really hope that audiences shun this movie. the people who are making it are evil. yeah  i said it.
ezra miller s neighbour saw him scrubbing graffiti off his front door and asked  what s going on here   ezra replies  just fkn kids!
defending erza miller would be too much of a stretch for stretch armstrong.also  infinity for first 20 seconds.
i love that you gave lara the giant butter.  that s gotta be a staple on this channel from now on.
the fact that they are willing to go to bat for this guy knowing the shit he did goes to show the state of hollywood. also i learned that lara croft loves her butta and wishing that s a health item for future tomb raider games.
ezra knows  they them  is his get out of jail card.
always been loving the content  but recently it feels it s even more powerful than ever before. the spirit works through you it s clear!
i ve never heard of anyone who identifies as  non-binary  who didn t also have other obvious anti-social personality traits. i think people who identify as  non-binary  are people who like to make a scene and are deliberately trying to be difficult. they know that it s awkward to say  they them  when referring to a specific individual  and that a lot of people will either refuse or mess up from time to time  and that gives the  non-binary  person an opportunity to make a scene. these people exist to cause trouble. i think someone identifying as  non-binary  is a major red flag  and i would disassociate with anyone like that immediately.
i m learning that being woke is away to make excuses for themselves for being stupid  and doing horrible things  and making it acceptable. also cant wait to see your stream of legend of zelda totk.
that beginning was savage  love it! straight up tell them we re not placating their fantasies anymore.
i still have no desire to watch this film even with the cameos set to make an appearance in the flash. i m not supporting a criminal such as ezra miller.
so happy to hear melonie is returning to simpcast    it wasn t the same without her.
the pronoun thing is just ridiculous. and they just do this bs. for a german it s very weird. here  the plural was used for rulers  for noblemen  for kings and queens. it just feels weird and wrong to read all this they them stuff
woke members never get consequences for their actions. really shows you the kind of people in charge of the world. not that we didn t already know but i hate seeing such obvious evidence of it.
that s the thing  he s not really a good actor  he s just one of their queer pets.
and he s not even a good actor.
@waltt69  bingo!
he s not a good actor. he s just checked off to many weird boxes on the  mental illness we pretend aren t mental illnesses  checklist for studios to fire him.
@lvthor ascending  the sick thing is  they flaunt it.
he isn t even a good actor. he acts nothing like barry allen.
me too but i doubt it. a lot of people are like children this days and they will run to see michael keaton batman.
this is an entire generation of young adults and teenagers who have grown up in single mother homes with no father or any male role models  an incessantly stressed out mother who constantly uses her  single mother  status as a manipulative tool   a constant reminder of what a burden the children are  who have been allowed to access adult media since early childhood as they get passed from one stranger in daycare to another. they are all severely mentally ill and they think childhood sexuality is normal. it s going to get worse and worse  as these kids grow up.
@zubilee gluckgluck  i agree  sometimes these mothers do it to the men though  and it s because the idea of a nuclear family is not naturally ideal  to anybody these days. i kind of wish that would change.
@zubilee gluckgluck  but i can honestly say i blame women for pushing men away from helping to raise rhe children  no offense if you a women  but it happens alot.
@nosaj ttimmed  lol i m not a woman and i agree with you. 80  of divorces are initiated by women. 60-80  of children are born to and live with single mothers. these kids are 4 to 9 times more likely to experience poverty  mental illness  addiction issues  homelessness and 80  of  incarcerated people are from single mother households. it s an epidemic of dysfunction that we know is a direct harm to children but we re not allowed to say anything because anyone who speaks truth is now a bigot or has some irrational phobia. it s not looking good for these kids  and it s 2nd thru current 4th wave feminism  which is more of a woman s supremacy ideology than the original equality thing. add the new women who are really men into this toxic mess and we can all watch as society crumbles around us.
@zubilee gluckgluck  yup. women destroy themselves and wanna blame us guys for what they do. like i can even say that melonie put her foot in her mouth sometimes  because there are sometimes  i m just like  what the hell is she doing
his pronoun should be pedo if he wants to be honest.
they thems and autogynephiles are the modern day untouchable inverted monarchy
been going to half price books and buying some old movies to watch... its a good experience and movies are quite good. depressing what is happening to the world.
one of the few channels still out there telling it how it is  bravo!
ezra miller is the bestest flash ever!!  man what a slap in the face to grant gustin
you know they just kept ezra because he said he was theythem. it definitely ain t because he s the best for the role.
last we checked we already had a really good  the flash  moviewe just call it iron man!thanks for covering this melonie mac! go boom!
it is said that after this reset they will let ezra go  they just don t want to redo or get another actor at the moment but after reset anything can be done going forward
with the massive amount of money involved  they can t let this film slide into oblivion.
michael keaton is the only reason i wanna the flash
i m still going to watch the movie out of curiosity to see if it s all that like they try to make it out to be
that opening  dropping triggering truth bombs off the bat
i sure hope there is new universe coming called the ncu that s actually giving people characters people want to see like mario  link  samus  kirby just to name a few.
i know for a fact keaton was the reason i saw for a majority of people planning to see the movie  same for me but i also genuinely was starting to think it might be interesting  it felt interesting at least. but then one singular dude ruined the whole project. it s pretty sad. don t understand why they didn t replace him  and now a movie that may or may not have potentially done well  isn t gonna do well in general because of one dude.
ever noticed how meloniemac has that  bad girl  image  but has a good track record as we can tell  but others in entertainment try to present a good image but  behind the scenes  there is allegations
i am convinced that ezra knows where the bodies are hidden.also get yourself a partner that looks at you like lara looks at butter. that s true love right there
even lara croft knows what the modern day treasures are to hunt  and not to store it in the fridge. aa video melonie
ezra miller is a shining example for gen z.
it s a theory  but one that seems super obvious to me-- this came out after news the movie will tank. the director is committing to presenting  loyalty to his lead  gaining himself kudos in the system... knowing he ll never have to get within a million miles of him ever again. i can see the logic.
the sad reality is that even though there is no disputes of character rights in dc warner.  you have dc comics  warner television and warner brothers films in a decades long pissing contest . right now it s all about writer and director egos
these estimated costs that are published never include advertising or re-shoots.  this film has a legit claim to be one of the most expensive in history and really does need to make over  1 billion.
they had the time and spent all that money. they should ve spent it recasting and reshooting miller.i ll wait for the free youtube movie clips for my batman scenes rather than give money to a movie that will credit miller for its success. if he gets a wi s he will return and we ll have to go through this all over again.
me too man. haven t bought anything new since endgame came out in what 2019
i struggle  to name a good movie that came after 2009 2010.
aa stands for the brand of butter featured
broken home
@angela milani  when you think about it.  that might make a good comic  tv show or movie in itself.
it was made already before he was convicted of crimes you have 250 million to pay the studio
i disagree they no its for keaton not miller  i think ezra is done wheater it mzkes a billion or not
i love how you start this video  and you are absolutely right on that. always here for my friend melonie mac
i will only see this movie by streaming it. my biggest disappointment is that there is no reverse flash. how can you do flashpoint with thawne. he is essential to the story.
haha freaking loved this haha no we aint gonna pretend a male female can ghange their gender. its a abomination
you are world treasure. glad that you are! keep telling the truth!
great video. plus  i love lara leaning on the giant stick of butter.
i ll consider catching this when it s on a streaming service i m already paying for.
it actually looks like it might be good  but if ezra wasn t in a protected class of  victims  they would have cancelled this movie. so  it s cancelled to me. maybe i ll catch it on streaming someday.
they re keeping him in the franchise because he s one of    them     i guess so is gal  but she s too normal and likable for their taste.
this movie will do good if only for michael keaton coming back as bruce wayne and the bats.p.s. you looking really bright and happy here lately  love it. happy to see those happy vibes.  p.s.s. also  it s nice to see your arms for a change.
you ever notice that the more people let these mental diseases have their way the worse movies  television shows and games get.
non-binary is like a fashion statement more than anything. like saying  i m a goth  or something.i know at least a couple of people that just label themselves as that to get the rainbow brigade off their backs at their tech jobs.i also know a girl that labels herself that  but then you get on her instagram and she posts bikini pictures... that seems really binary to me.
the flash has one  of the highest test audience scores high 80 . which means it is a good movie and will be entertaining. the flash movie was completed before all the news of the bad behavior came out. only reshoots have been done. this movie was completed 2 years ago.
i mean the movie wont flop though. despite what happens i still want to see the movie regardless of behind he scenes.
i agree that whatever miller identifies as doesn t exist  however i don t think this movie will flop.  i will support everyone else involved in the movie. one thing that s so annoying are the wokies constantly referring to him as they
dang  she came out the gate with straight fire.
as much as i would love to see keaton batman again. it s a pass for me.
i was thinking about giving this movie a chance mainly because the new owners inherited the ezra miller problem from the old owners.  and i would have gone to see it if they either have remained silent about ezra as much as possible or came out and denounced him for his actions.  but since they are trying to protect him and even possibly keeping him onboard while henry cavill is getting the boot.  i m not watching it.
the first thing i would had done was changed the name to flashpoint for marketing and then announce there moving on after this movie
that stick of butter lara is holding  gave me a chuckle.
i also liked miller in justice league.
if she doesnt identifi as a girl  you dont need to wear a bra. if your afraid to walk around shirtless and with no bra  your not a dude.
first 20 seconds of this video  pure gold!
i like ezra miller as comedy relief in the justice league but the flash was never meant to be funny. he s meant to be a statesman mature diplomatic and nonviolent attitude.
they must live in an alternative universe where there are no consequences for your actions.
honestly the flash is going to do great at the box office. keaton coming back will be the reason. to keep the dc movies alive  they ll have to erase miller s flash at the end and introduce a new actor
i guess you can say ticket sales weren t a flash!
the only thing faster than the flash is the speed at which warner is going to recast the role and distance themselves from ezra miller about a month after this movie comes out - or however long it takes for the studio to make back the money they have spent on it.
dc can just never seem to make good decisions both in the comics and the box office these days.also  am i the only one that expects that giant stick of butter to get smaller and smaller over the next several videos  lara croft s staring at it and she looks hungry
people will forget that.  - the reason they didn t release it last year.
regardless of ezra miller  the movie looks entertaining to me. i m in it just to see michael keaton as batman again.
james gunn was quick to let henry cavill go but looks like they want to keep ezra miller
i love the addition to lara!
id rather watch melonie run errands using the ezra voice for 2 hrs. i dunno why it just made me burst out laughing
this movie must be fire if erza miller could go do all that shit and they went and gave us 2 of him.
the fact that wb could have avoided all this by keeping henry cavill and zack synder and pleasing the fans but they chose to instead protect 2 abusers  pedo and make a pedo the head of dc.
the director can want ezra miller all he wants  but the final say is james gunn.
i agree about what you said about non-binary. i just don t get why people want to be considered  they them  they and them are multiple people. not just one. what s so bad about being consider  him his  or  her she   i just don t get it. lol
the only reason why people will go watch this movie is to see michael keaton play batman on the big screen again.
same melonie! i just can t even with ezra miller! it s sick that they keep him in movies!
thumbs up for the intro absolutely agree i am not playing the pretend game with them
6 30  in defiance of hollywood  i simply won t forget  there s something so evil about that statement
and speaking of skeletons in closets  what about the woman and three kids that vanished from miller s home  notice that no-one is talking about this  want to bet that we will  suddenly  have an update on this situation about a month after this movie comes out
is that a big stick of butter in the background  okay...i m shocked that the flash wasn t canceled because of miller s ludicrous ways.
odd that wbd max features a armie hammer documentary  but ezra gets a pass for the bs unlike hammer stuff.
here s what you do  melonie buy a ticket to a different movie  then sneak into the flash.
if one were to watch the remake of the stand with ez as trash can man  one realizes he wasn t acting in that role  and why anyone would put it in a lead role is beyond me. maybe wb going for esg points
it s a shame too because michael keaton s batman would have been great in a better movie.
it s mind boggling right  love the giant butter stick
i imagine lara could slide down a snowy mountain with that butter.obviously while the baddies chase her on skies and snowmobiles.
ezra miller is a fine actor. and actor s have issues. his issues are a bit further then most will put up with. but i am sure it will be a fine movie.
the bud light effect. i think wbd has a surprise coming to them when this movie drops if that s what they really think. there s already talk of an extended nudity scene done by ezra miller. the person who had a 12 year old be awarded a restraining order against him  in a superhero movie aimed at kids........ good luck with that. i ve coined my own phrase for this situation in particular. these people have antivaxxers and all sorts of cute little pet names and i decided on one of my own referring to the people promoting this movie. i call them......epstein sympathizers. i very much think had someone not ghosted his ass these are the people who would be camped outside of the prison with poster board signs reading   jeffrey epstein did nothing wrong! that s really how i view these people.
gone in and out of the theaters in...a flash.
the intro was a perfect 10 10!
hollywood is like stanley kubrick s  eyes wide shut  movie  which i believe is based on real life hollywood s dark secret and kubrick himself died suddenly 6 days after showing the final cut of the movie to warner bros  3 months before the movie is released   suggesting that he was murdered for exposing the hidden reality of the film industry to the public just like what would happen if  a mason exposes the secret of freemason to the uninitiated people.
they could revive kevin conroy and i still wouldn t spend a penny on it
zack snyder hired him. whatever zack had planned for the character  this is not that. the only time ezra got to play that role was  zack snyder s justice league   and it was completely worth it. all of ezra s other appearances do not compare to that portrayal in that film.
they are hoping that people have forgotten the allegations against them! ohh wait a sec  what about the other allegations  the very serious allegations that are no longer being talked about  did some company pay off these folks  just a few questions that have questioning the timing of the article itself   people do have short memories but not short enough as they seem to think!
as far as the movie goes i m going to wait for someone to reedit it to only show the batman scenes and put it on youtube.this whole thing is so mind boggling  johnny depp with through hell for a lot less and despite coming out on top hasn t really returned to his previous status  but this guy has a laundry list of crimes and accusations and still gets so much praise  i hate to think what it would actually take for those falling all over him to see him for what he really is.
i m only watching the flash when it s illegally uploaded to the internet and i can watch it for free  because i want to see it for michael keaton as batman and nicolas cage s cameo as superman  not for ezra miller as the flash.
thank you.  the pro noun shenanigans.  good grief. btw the article had babs relationship to andy wrong. not wife  but siblings.  yikes. sorry for the rambling. the world is broken...
i saw something about nic cage having a cameo as superman  but even that can t get me to watch this. your hair is really pretty that way  melonie. have a wonderful day
i just want to see the movie  don t care about actors that much.
if it had been henry cavill that did those things they would have booted him even faster than then already did.
hollywood gives a free pass for bad criminal behavior or ignores it as long as they need that person. weistein s activities were known and ignored well before they came to public attention. if the movie had already been released and they had got their money for it they would have dumped miller quicker than de caprio dumps a girlfriend celebrating her 25th birthday.
don t  they know  people remember  what they have done over the last couple of years
they only times using plural on a singular that make sense is. in royalty.  we are not amuse  - said some king  or when you are posses  we are legion  - said ezra.  and honestly  saying the wouldn t recast flash  only push more people away not keep them.
i will watch the flash to be honest. i like dc and i like the flash so i got tickets for two days wooo!
its weird to cast a flash who can t run. its like casting an aquaman who can t swim  lol. ezra runs hunched over and kind of stomps his feet  they should have given him some time with a track coach to prepare for the role.  not to mention the alleged other crimes ...
i d say at this point  the director is enabling miller s mental illness.. but this is hollywood and he s more likely sharing one.
don t they know that their statements will just make people do a google search into what they have done.
why does laura croft have a giant stick of butter  also  people are only gonna care for keaton as batman and cage as superman. remember  henry cavil gets the boot but this thing still stays because they re a  protected class .
that big ass stick of butter!
ezra is innocent until proven guilty.
just one of this guy is hard enough to withstand  and that s when he is the side character. imagining a full movie where he is the main character but he plays another character as well and it s an even more annoying version of him. sounds like the worst thing to ever subject yourself to.
melonie  it looks like lara is trying to  butter you up.
yeah  but despite all of ezra s crimes  they re still good at playing barry. just ignore all of ezra s alleged victims and consume product.
thank u so dam much for ur opening statement !!
ezra uses the lgbt as a shield to get away with his behavior and i m sure a lot of others in hollywood that do the same
amen to that melonie  the whole nonbinary and they thems. loved your butter video today. that was so much fun. you look great. i hope you have a fun day melonie
warner bros  dc  of course the director of the film and probably james gunn too love to simp for a criminal that s nonbinary
gotta love your common sense opening. go boom with truth bombs for each of your opening statements.
because they ve spent like 350 million on making this  or more   they probably cannot make money on it  no matter how good it may or may not be.
if discovery had just finalized the buy out of wb a bit sooner they could have forced the recast  dylan o brien would have been my choice  ...when the ink dried all primary filming was done and a huge amount of money already spent on the movie.....all they had left was editing.  sucks
starting off hot dropping truth bombs!!!
so ezra miller has pictures and evidence to hold against this director as well then  like the rest of hollywood that has passed him around for years!
perfect intro. keaton as batman is a hit of nostalgia though i m not going to watch this movie.
they dropped all of these leaks to fill in seats only to ruin it with announcing that he will be in the sequel if there is one.i now have no interest
this is what happens when woke points matter more than a person s integrity or in this case their acting chops. it s all about checkboxes now nobody actually has to be good at their freaking acting jobs in order to get a roll which includes voice acting because now you have to be of the same race to even play that character type. meaning if i  a white man  ever wanted to voice a black character in an animated show i would be crucified for even suggesting it and i wouldn t get the job anyway regardless if i did a better service than an actual black man.hollywood used to be considered the elites now they are strictly a circus of hypocrites and a joke. very soon most people won t even use cable  or even most streaming services for entertainment  hell they won t even go to the movies anymore. they will just be finding better ways to entertain themselves. the only outsource they might have is youtube or patreon
it s shame since i heard the film is actually not bad.
the hollywood conspiracies scare and disgust the hell outta me.
butter! lara!  melonie!  who could ask for anything moar
you get a like and subscribe for that first sentence alone! i m sick of that farce.
ahhh! the butter!!!!! i love it!!!!!
i never realized that hardcore simping required needpads and a bib. grant gustin would make a better movie flash barry allen. plus  they d have access to a better looking suit.
micheal keaton  enough said  i am seeing it period. also the actor for zod is good to
honestly  it looks like it could be a good movie  but ezra is just so crazy and vile. he even did a good job portraying barry  but i just can t support him.
im still going to see this film. yes i hate ezra miller too  but that doesn t mean we have to drag the rest of the cast down with him  or them  whatever
not only am i sick and tired of dc s flailing attempts at chasing the mcu  but ezra miller belongs on jail  not in a movie studio.
idk anybody who prefers this flash over grant lol
the movie wont flop
i love your contents but i have to respectfully disagree that flash will make a sizable box office money and will either break even or make profit with multiple factors including michael keaton s batman  batfleck  the overall hype surrounding it.berry becoming they them by having multiple versions of himself is funny though  lol.
excellent analysis
the butter video is what propelled melonie onto my radar on this platform  and i am glad for it. we need as many true truth seekers as we can get  and this lady has the rare courage to follow her convictions and sacrifice for what she believes. whatever i  can offer to help in these endeavors to seek and speak truth is a price paid gladly. walk with god and never stop preaching  little lady.
micheal keaton is awsome i am seeing it for him
@gumpy flyale  yes! exactly
i don t think this movie is going to fail. i am super hyped and can t wait for it.
ezra miller hasn t been cancelled because he knows intimate details of every hollywood producers genitalia!
am i the only one who noticed the huge stick of butter lara crofts holding on to in the background
why don t they just drop miller like disney dropped depp
the flash  the fastest gr00mer in the world!
my destain for this movie was 100  based on ezra the stain miller  but now it s 99  towards him and 1  towards the director. i generally hope people think very carefully before they provide 1 penny towards the success of this movie  a man who s attacked multiple women portraying a superhero and role model  when he s anything but and there s no way i can contribute to his success or retainment. so i ve made the choice i no longer support dc until he s fired!!
great open  mel.
remember wb keeps employing amber heard as well.
melonie mac...   another great video...thanks for all you do...   never stop being you...   melonie you should create your own cosplay calendar like anna tswg and nina infinity... just think...   melonie mac as lara croft...   melonie mac as batgirl from 60 s batman series...   melonie mac as harley quinn...   melonie mac as vampirella...   melonie mac as wonder woman... gal gadot and lynda carter versions...melonie mac as black widow...   melonie mac as marion ravenwood...melonie mac as rey... i m serious...melonie mac as xena. warrior princess...   melonie please play conan exiles with...   az... nina infinity... xray girl... and jayne theory... it would be great...!!!you should go on simpcast...   may god and the force and the swartz and the glow...be with you... melonie because you deserve the best of everything in life...   battle on... melonie mac...    the real warrior princess...
dude from the tv show was the best flash.
the only good thing about this movie is it s gonna reset the whole universe and james gunn can begin ressurecting the dead corpse of the dceu
i never saw this guy as the flash  neither as barry allen or wally west  i just couldn t.  i think john wesley shipp was the best live action version of the character back in the early 90s  really anything else kind of falls short in my opinion.  they play the character off as a poor man s peter parker most of the time  or at least that s how it came across to me.even if that weren t the case i still wouldn t want to watch this based on what ezra miller s actions  he s a creep that i can t really see as heroic in any regard.  the only reason to watch this thing is michael keaton as batman  but even then i got the original 1989 movie on dvd so why bother
people will only go see this movie because michael keaton is reprising his role as batman
i hate how much ezra has ruined the image of one of my favorite hero s
the funniest thing i ve heard in a while is  semibisexual.  that s when you are bisexual but only attracted to one gender.
great opening
erza miller is not the beat choice to portray the flash grant gustin should be the new flash
i aint watchin  i ve had enough of paying for this.  his character on screen  i like  him as a person  should no longer be supported financially.
i have a hard time getting interested in the dcu universe  and the mcu is getting boring.  but all of the off-screen controversies just makes me not want to deal with any of it.  it s like i don t really care about any of it...except for what s on screen.  it s like why does any of it matter.  all of the woke personal crap is just tiresome.  just make the damn movie.
hollywood is a trap unless you know the law.
every time someone say they prefer to be called  they them   it only comes to mind the demons saying  we are legion   are you possessed by so many demons that they are claiming their pronoun to be used
non-binary  in addition to being a biological impossibility  is also a logical impossibility. if one is  non-binary  that means the alternative is  binary.  binary non-binary is  in and of itself  a binary  which makes a non-binary person inherently binary. and boom goes the dynamite.
that intro was golden
the biggest thing people fail to not even address is he is a groomer and cult leader of kids. i mean that literally - he has groomed kids for at the very least 5 years. only one case saw the light of day where a girls parents tried to get her away from him. now she is over 18 and can do what she wants but what about the years prior  a grown man hanging out with kids - look how that turned out with michael jackson. now think about a guy who thinks he s god being in that same situation.
if i going to see the movie because michael keaton batman. disney and most hollywood is very evil  nowadays.
i pretty much don t care about the ezra miller stuff at all i m going to see this because it looks epic.
too bad  i ve loved d.c. movies for about 20 years or so. since 1989 batman came out. all good things must come to an end they say
and shoutout to lara croft for watching the large stick of butter!
i do believe there is mason rituals but it is a deep rabbit hole  the will smith slap was a humiliation one  justin showing janet s boob  could go on and on.
ive heard the movie is borderline excellent...and that sucks  because i will not be seeing it due to my personal values being placed elsewhere.
i knew you d be whining about this movie sooner or later. i couldn t care less about ezra  the dude has issues  but a lot of his allegations were proven fake. this is my most anticipated film in 31 years 100  because of keaton s batman returning  and they say he steals every scene he is in  not surprised . and the pre-screening review scores for the film have been better than any comic book film since the dark knight. tom cruise is even praising it  saying it s the movie america needs right now. and he would know.
margot robbie is also staying as harley quinn so there s that which is good cuz she did a really good job as harley in the suicide squad movies as well as birds of prey and in regards to jason momoa i think he left the role of aquaman on his own accord cuz he didn t like how aquaman 2 turned out. also we all know how this is gonna turn out cuz the movie will bomb hard cuz people won t watching it due to ezra s criminal history then the directors and actors will pull the phobia card on those who didn t see it in a bid to guilt trip people into watching which will backfire on them harder.
i can t wait to not pay money for this.  we told them to get rid of ezra.
he was always that isufferable.
i ve always been a fan of dc and have been a fan of the  snyder  dc movies. man of steel  bvs  wonder woman 1 and snyder cut  i ve liked them all and genuinely believe they re good movies.i am not only not excited for this movie  i m kinda hoping it fails. they re are ruining the flashpoint paradox story which is a great flash story and using it as a poor excuse to reset the dceu which is extra scummy. i liked batfleck and everyone liked henry cavill s superman  but they chose to keep miller. what a joke. i 100  support boycotting this movie.although super girl kinda bad though.
i am seriously questioning everyone going to see this movie who is aware of ezra miller s actions.  even with michael keaton as batman do you really want to support an unhinged lunatic who is also a litteral cult leader  who kifnapped and groomed a child  i won t tell you what to do with your money  but come on.
unfortunately it s probably going be the biggest movie this summer. at the least it ll be behind spiderverse
batman is awesome  and the flash has been effusively praised by everyone who has seen it. so saying it isn t gonna be good is disingenuous. i guarantee you it will be awesome. ezra is a scumbag but he fits the role. same with amber  she s a good mera but she s a scumbag.
hollywood makes no sense to me when it comes to stuff like this   i thought the amberheard shit was crazy but this   the johnathan majors stuff is ridiculous. i m glad keanu reeves is so humble
yeah but if they make this movie exactly like flashpoint then everyone who read is going to know everything they have to change it bit
@imthawne  bro  that s the entire point of adapting a story. you are retelling the story  just in a different format.if it was an exact adaptation of the flashpoint paradox story   or as close as you could fit in a 2 1 2 - 3 hour movie  it would blow everything marvel has made since endgame out of the water. it would be an believable success.this ain t it chief.
why does everyone call him a groomer he isnt a groomer he didnt groom anyone there is no evidence that he did
i say if people really wanna see it  they should just watch it bootleg  hit em were it hurts  they want your cash not your views. hope it tanks and so does aquaman 2 for keeping turd i mean heard on
file this under  what were they thinking .
why didn t they give the role to the actor from the tv show  i had the impression that show was popular. has he aged out or something
i identify as non-attending  the flash movie . figure that s the fastest way to help dc move on.
your intro earned you a new sub
dang thirty seconds in already dropping facts
doubt it. too many good reviews. alot of people love it. word of mouth will have others see it. its going to suceed. and when it does i hope it makes everyone mad.
don t be ashamed. if you did and i did   at least before i even knew the guy existed at the time when i saw justice league   we all did. lucky   unlike hollywood   we know better now and he needs to go.
that s funny because i m hearing ezra miller is the worst part of the movie. so if they really are not recasting him dc might wanna reconsider that decision.
with what  all he did i wouldn t forget. it s the same none for you and all for me. that includes crime.
they is  a good actor!
you know what  i ve had it!when you write a massively successful book series that ends up becoming a film saga and then an an insanely successful video game.......i m gonna boycott you and tell people they re committing genocide by giving you any attention!!so there! i.....what...  it already happened  the crazies came out of the woodwork oh  nevermind then. carry on.totally supported you the whole time! yup. ok gotta go.
i usually associate the ass noise with hillary clinton or aoc  but dang girl you had me lauighing!
gunn will probably reboot the whole universe regardless of how well this does ..then .the assaulting they  them  him  her  rattle and hum  she  we and this and that ..can quietly go away ..
he could straight up murder someone and they still would support him
like are you saying flop by not making enough money to cover itself because i agree with that
are we not gonna talk about that big behind bar of butter next to lara croft
omg!  that stick of butter in the back!!! get it lara!! lol!
ezra miller the fasters criminal in hollywoke the not to be trusted joke.
comically large stick of butter has entered the chat
lol
barry keoghan would be a better flash.
they have his back because they themselves have done the same things. filth standing up for filth
i m only going to watch for batman
there should be no reason to support ezra miller or warner bros
0 04 best intro ever
they will bait audiences with an elderly man who starred in a film made 30  years ago.
i am not going to pay for anything that has to do between wb and dc  the way they treated cavill  how they treated the fans and now they release this movie where it erases everything about the man of steel  they leave miller after everything that he did and they take out cavill and restart the universe that many of us wanted to see.
at this point i just think it s big boy hollywood try to push and claim money they can. because a lot of people want ezra out at this point it s not just about left or right  people hate him them she  bastard   honestly he s a terrible person that doesn t deserve the respect and only one of the few people i hope there career burns to the ground
butter! great video just for that!
lara croft chilling with a giant butter stick in the background. that alone should tell you who s video this is.
wait a second. what if they do it on purpose  even an idiot will understand that people are against lgbt  race swap and the like  but they continue to do it. they lose money under the pretext of an unsuccessful decision   advertising  but in fact they put all the money in their pocket
i thought mo mo was the comic relief
love the intro! how do i leave two likes
why does the suit look like cw level of effects
he isn t in jail !
ezra has those redneck pronouns.  example   did you see they them there sellin  hogs dahn a  the county fair
lol  why does lara have a giant stick of butter under her arm
ezra miller represents everything wrong with woke and hollywood privilege
they are lying their ass off by saying zack snyder and henry cavill love the movie and called it a masterpiece and the best comic movie ever.lmao.. they are that desperate..  restorethesnyderverse
it should flop but it probably won t. i wish i could be less cynical about this   but nowadays.
too much nostalgia to flop
@anthony fernandez  yes  indeed. when you factor in nostalgia and the simple fact that most people don t know who the hell ezra miller is  the likelihood of this movie bombing is slim.
@anthony fernandez  it used to be that not knowing who the lead actor was could be a detriment to a summer blockbuster  but it s superhero movie and there are no stars anymore anyway.
the guy deserves to be in prison
i will let you go see it melonie  tell me how it was
for sure not watching this movie  at all.
yeah i have no plans on seeing this
hollywood are now run by scum for scum  lets pursue alternative entertainment markets that give us the good stuff from good people.
pretty privilege with ezra
lmao the donkey npc
what about the weird grooming shit  that should be an automatic disqualifier and a direct flight to snake island.
melonie mac... in charge.love ya girl
trailer that i saw in the theater looked great. that said... i hope that it does flop.
most people have no clue about ezra miller. i only know by watching nerdrotic etal.
is no one going to mention the gigantic blowup stick of butter in the background
0 04 so true  i tried reading lil uzi verts wiki page recently and my brain nearly exploded from the retarded use of pronouns.
yep  if just identifying as something made it so  then heck i identify as a trillionaire and the emperor of mars.  p
good! im glad this movie is tracking low. its been in development since 2016 iirc. shortly after justice league came out.wbd should have cancelled this along with their other dc movies.  but david needs money so thats why its being released. instead of cutting the animation departments  they could have cut thus and wrote it off.
wb  defend pos liek ezrawb  fire good people like depp and henry
goboomverse
happy wednesday melonie mac
the butter inflatable is a nice touch.
unrelated question... is that a giant stick of butter lara s hugging on to
i refuse to watch this and i hope enough people feel the same way as i do.the only lesson hollywood wants to learn is a lack of green lesson - it must be taught to them over and over again - until they learn to respect the audience.
he s really annoying in everything but i m not a fan of snyders films so this new one is a hard sell even without his crimes
beauty and brains...subscribed.
dc fans have long complained about hollyweird and woke culture  yet i m seeing them giving a pass to this movie. there s no way i ll give a single penny to wb and this criminal.
just going to say it this will fail  and it does they will go into  damage control people have started to question hollwoke media more this year bud proofing people do have to give you their money.
hey  batmyan   lol!
hey  keep lara out of your butter fetish  d
they should actually check the backgrounds of these people. he s a groomer and has been in multiple cults. i can t say i ever liked him as an actor.
people don t really remember. most people just aren t interested. movie looks fine though.
meh im still going to watch this movie
can t watch right now because of work  but i ll just leave a comment for the algorithm and to help a friend.
dc will fire people who have done nothing wrong but keep a man  edit  boy  who has hit women. makes sense.
they them is not real if its just one person. thumbs up.
i ve stopped watching media with actors who are garbage human beings. flash was my favorite superhero but no dice homeslice. edited to say that they aren t wrong to say people will forget about what ezra has done  society is completely fkd after all...
isn t it disrespectful to have a  them  be playing a man  where s the representation of men  the flash is a man not a  them ... they cry over the whale not being an actual obese person yet say nothing about these pretend genders taking roles from real men.
my kids aren t allowed to watch woke
i think it s going to be good though ezra miller is weird guy.
how can be a  them  if he is an  actor
ezra miller is so goin  to hell
batman is my favorite dc character
the way that simp reporter used they them  they them can only talk about one person at a time because the reader would not know which they them is being referenced
the only thing this flash movie has going for it is bringing keaton back as batman. i don t like anything about ezra and even though the actress for supergirl is decent i don t like the masculine look of the character.
great butter... i mean assessment  mel!
they have spoiled the whole the flash movie in their marketing  why would people need to go to the movie theater
boom that movie with the mac 11 good vid respect
i really don t agree with your point of view. i mean thousands of good people work on this movie. just because one person go nuts doesn t mean the entire movie deserves to be flopped. i will support this movie for keaton  sasha and shanon and affleck as well.
what s going on with the butter stick  lol
zany  yet down-to-earth  conspiracy theory of the day  all the people who have been  metoo d by hollywood so far  they re all sacrificial lambs to keep the public s eyes away from the people committing even worse atrocities behind-the-scenes.
they blacked balled johnny dept for some b.s but ezra gets off easy for what sounds like he might be a kitty diggler and likes beaten women
i m only going to watch this film  cos of  michael keaton
your a insane if you keep ezra miler
not that it s a big deal but barbara andi are brother and sister i believe
but he is right there! a they them!
all productions that include ezmerelda is doa
love that crop top  mel
i refuse to see anything with a servant of the fallen one. i guess if they got hitler  a serial giller or a child moe.lester dc would hire them and promote them in their next 400 million dollar movie
i was like 666. appropriate number considering this specific actor and hollywood in general.
is that laura croft with a stick of butter ! !  ! ! ! it s true....she s like buttah.
in other words  he s now living his life as a gay man...
i don t get the butter cameo in the background
is that a big enough stick of butter
where have you been  ur take   ur made me laugh
there aren t enough esg dollars in the universe to save wb dc from the money i hope this thing loses.
turf nation homegirl.
lawlz.  true intro...is that a giant butter stick
the donkey sound
amazing intro
boycott the flash
they have an animated one. personally i refuse to fund anything with him in it. he has assaulted people broken into homes and groomed a kid yet has received zero consequences! plus his flash feels nothing like the character...honestly though forget freemasons just look up bohemian grove that s a rabbit hole! xd
ezra miller
frankly   i don t even know why it s still a conversation.   hollywood is corrupt beyond belief  it is immoral  flagrantly anti-family  and anti-individual freedom.    all hollywood movies should be boycotted without exception.   unless its an independent studio  creating a movie that is very in line with my values  i m never going to see it.  even if it s the most perfectly constructed movie to appeal to my interests.   not another dime of my money is going towards the institution of hollywood in any form.  that s my position.
i miss the closet.
ezera hides behind the trans shield while being a child r pist.
i m surprised by these comments. does no one understand why the elephant is still in the room  i ll give you a hint  it rhymes with   . there s too much invested in this movie. they can t cancel him ...  them  at this point cause it doesn t make financial sense
yeah  i don t believe in pronouns but they them can also be anything they want per their fluidity.   ex a black lesbian cat  or hispanic non-binary frog  etc...
if this guy was straight  hollywood wouldn t be simping so hard for him.
not surprised by any of this
alphabet community privilege baby!
we haven t even watched the trailer
comes out june 16......so 616 is also the 666
i ve been here! haha! thank you so much
that s what groomers do
@el gato felix  right on you are.
did she make that donkeh sound bit
ezra is just a rotten human being. i was a kevin spacey fan for years before i knew what he is. a lot of these stars are just not good people.the only ones that seem normal are keanu and chris pratt.
sweet tshirt
non binary they them ain t real  made me subscribe
i m a dc movie fan  but this is ridiculous!
they really need someone else to be  cast as the flash not ezra  and ezra is not a flash barry material . glad i m not watching it.
them they is real. thats plural
did melanie make the donkey sound effect
nice stick of butter. remember to drink water. everyone have a wonderful day.
if ezra miller was a regular straight guy with the same criminal record  liberals would have totally written him off by now.
they need to relies that the   show flash is better cw all the way
probably best not to watch it at all. is free really free
mo better butter

but it s filled with  member berries   it s got the guy that said the thing  you member the guy right. i d watch cleopatra before this dumpster fire of a movie.
not likely.
that s one big butter.
yeah  i dont care if this is the best movie they ever made in the dceu. no way i m supporting this.
ezra is the main reason i won t be watching this movie. grant gustin was a much better flash even though the show on cw itself was bad with the writing
liked for the non binary intro!
people are seeing this movie is gonna be bad but if it turns out to be good people are gonna eat their words
i don t watch movies with women s abusers in it. i can t care less what is the movie about or how  good  it is. i am principles and live by then  something that you can t buy.
boycott flash
checks early life
noo not the real life reverse  flash
even tho ezra commited all these crimes i just hope that he gets the help he needs and turns his life around what does piss me of tho is that everyone is saying all the allegations are true like he groomed a child even tho there is no evidence and we also didnt see the full context of the woman he choked yeah he shouldnt choke her no matter what but she probably insulted him or pissed him of and people started recording after all that
hey melonie love your tank shirt and your hair in ponytail looks great too. anyway i have to say that i am not a big flash fan and i have never seen or watched flash tv show series and so i can say that i think that ezra needs to be in jail and charged for the crime that he has committed and be locked up in prison for life and get a mental evaluation help and turn his life around so that he can have a better life and have a successful career in movie career. also i have loved the batman from the 1989 batman movie and i thought that michael keaton did a great job with the batman movie role and i hope michael keaton does well playing his batman role in this new flash movie in june. anyway that s all i want to say about this video for today  ok melonie. hope you had a great day today and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. god bless you melonie.
finkel is ihorn ihorn is finkel
commenting to feed the algorithm
flat out ezra boycott
he is an awful excuse for an actor.
i won t support this human or this franchise in any way
aren t they doing a complete dc reboot anyway  so the movie is 100  pointless.
0 03 had to unsubscribe from melonie cuz she started off with the most disrespectful thing to say in youtube and that s to speak common sense
keep shooting y all in the foot wb. y all fired johnny depp for way less than that  but yet refuse to fire amber heard just because she s a woman or maybe because she s bi and ezra miller just because he s  non-binary   come on! if that s the case then why don t every actor just comes out as  non-binary  then they could just do whatever they want without having to worry about the consequences !
i won t see that movie  because of erza.sorry keaton.i ll also skip aquaman 2 because of amber heard.
not watching it at all neither is my whole family
should wear more tank tops can see the sleeve of tatts dig a sleeve. dude ezra doesn t even run properly for flash.
get rid of cavill  but keep erza miller and amber turd. what could go wrong  right  warner  well  you fuck around and now you re gonna find out.
he is a good flash....he is also a crazy weirdo who assaults women...
but i hope its like the animated flashpoint what an amazing movie
jealous
i almost exclusively wear tank tops already haha
i find it kinda funny that this dude uses the they them nonsense yet play s the fastest man alive. because these idiots think gender is bad and we all need to be a liquid or something.
sodomite thats also a predo color me shocked.
why do you have a giant stick of butter
i m not interested in seeing this or anything miller s in. if dc wants to stand behind this psycho  that s their business. it s my business where i spend my money. it s not going to be on this movie.
par-kay.   nod
couldn t agree more with all the pronouns bull
i never was an ezra miller fan. i don t believe he has any actual range to his acting and is always just the same character in a different outfit.  half the time it feels like he is trying to channel a poor man s version of sheldon cooper from  big bang theory  and failing...badly.
like for the first 10 seconds
anything with  ezra  needs to flop! he s a disgusting human being.
great melonie mac go boom not cool ezra his criminal

ezra miller was the worst flash the best one was from the arrow verse
miller has never been an even decent flash. man  how standards have been lowered....like that big stick of butter.
damn you look good anyways. i want to see it  but...the galactic forces keep...averting my gaze to... home ...movies....back.... logs.....90s....brad....pitt.....
i can already see the headlines  transphobic toxic male fans review bomb our movie    transphobic fans boycott the flash because they are biggotts!
no he has always had a very annoying voice
i m just going to pirate this shit idgaf anymore
i can t stand ezra miller  i ain t watching this movie  i would of watched a keaton batman without miller
disney  just greenlit a new german show about a teenage girl who falls in love with and gets impregnated by none other than satan himself . i m not making this shit up.
fucking hell
batman is selling this movie  no one cares about the flash.
how can anyone claim they know with certainty that they are something they ve actually never been  the whole notion is a socially constructed hoax no different than flat earth or q-anon.
reality-check  non-binaries  they-them ain t real.
i am for ezra miller to be removed from any future dc movies. i watched the justice league for wonder woman and superman. the flash was ok in the snyder version. i will be watching this movie especially for batman and supergirl. i wanna see if supergirl gonna be  done right or corrupted by wokeness. ezra probably already got his paycheck so not gonna see the movie cause you people dont wanna support him is understandable however useless.
i loved the video just for the  non-binary  is not real.
critical reviews.... keaton steals the show... and miller is a side character in his own movie. he isnt a  leading  man  or can lead a show movie on his own.. he cant.. he s a side character  and should remain so  he doesnt have the presence to lead a movie..unlike the current spiderman   kid   lol   he is really good  he is believable in the role... miller    no...
yes this movies gonna be total garbage.
we didnt do ebonix when someone tried to make that a thing  we arent doing this pronoun shit either. pronouns are for sentences.
the flash is supposed to be charismatic like spiderman  this dude is not and i find him to be kinda creep.
ezra miller has always had that annoying voice
if they do replace ezra miller as the flash the only option is a black fat female lesbian who identifies as non-binary pansexual trans
grant gustin did it better.
flash isn t a comedy character
love to be a fly on the wall. in the meeting where gunn decides to get rid of henry cavill. n others. but keep this trans criminal
he s a horrible barry allen  he s another spazzy actor like jesse eisenberg that would make a better toyman  or some minor bad guy  but as flash i think he sucks.
so much bigotry
it s not only going to flop cause of ezra miller but also the stupid supergirl bulls  t.
well  i don t think god is real. is that cool with y all
this movie is gonna flop
thumbs down  too much rambling.
i agree 100
never cared about this movie anyways. just like marvel  dc is dead.

what does any of this have to do with whether or not this is a good movie  i thought that all of you conservatives were against censorship.
