100  true. reading lord of the rings is directly tied to such horrors as  respect for your fellow man  personal responsibility  loyalty  chivalry  self-sacrifice  bravery  justice  an unwavering sense of duty  and yes... even the notion that men and women are different and complement one another.
orwell and tolkien both warned against tyranny. so of course they have to go.
honestly  i was waiting for them to come after 1984. that book s  new speak  form of english  which is devoid of anything too negative or positive that might upset someone and is constantly re-worked with new increasingly banal phrases in an effort to enforce state-sanctioned thought processes and ideology  pretty much sums up what we re seeing today. orwell predicted a lot of madness and people regularly cite his work in lamenting what s happening to our language.  don t call them women! that offends trans-women  who feel othered by the prefix. trans-women are now women  and women are now cis-women. that comforts the trans community and promotes inclusivity while calling attention to the abnormality of normality. cis-women are biological females who choose to have a feminine gender identity  which itself is entirely separate from biological form. the only real  non-prefixxed women are those with xy chromosomes.   good  and don t use the term mother anymore. mother is a gendered term. birthing person  because a biological female who chooses to have a masculine gender identity can have children... in which case  he d be a father or they d be a breeder. birthing person is thus more inclusive. it s double plus good.  reads like something straight from one of 1984 s bureaucratic orders. working the book out of the zeitgeist would remove a frame of reference.edit addition  tweaked some punctuation on an unintended run-on sentence. slightly less brutal now.
government  1984 is bad for you mmkay...also government  let s create our own  ministry of truth make it make sense
whenever i hear the phrase  updated for a modern audience   i always run the other way. xd
i m ok with being a right wing extremist. i m a straight  white  married  christian male who has 2 kids. they ve already said i m the worst. being called a right wing extremist is a badge of honor.
can t wait to see the remake they re making of these absolute classics. frodo will toss the ring into the lava  him and sam will run out barely escaping the river of fire and as they sit on that rock together they ll stare into each others eyes lovingly for a few brief seconds...and then french kiss in silence for 20 minutes straight until the credits roll.
remember  the people trying to tell you what you can and can t enjoy  for your own good   they re the good guys  everyone   wink  wink
the woke mob just keep on completing us! i love the lotr and i ll always be a fan of the original story!  bigitarmy
they better not edit his text like they did with roald dahl... thank the lord i have the physical copies of the books!
really good video melonie. i always love when you talk about being a christian. you can rant about that all day every day and i m not going to hate it. take care melonie. and may god continue to bless you. oh and by the way. love the pray you posted on twitter.
i m happy that we can always read the books  watch the movies and pretend that rings of power never existed.
bigotry has never been so based
the books are amazing. if you enjoyed the movies  which i also like  you will enjoy the books even more. i did not want the story to end when i first read them over 40 years ago in my early teens. i have never been taken in to another world the way i was with these stories.
thank you for articulating the difference between being ok with violence in fiction as compared to sex. i feel the same way.
wow  this explains everything! and i thought crackheads and two-bit hood rats were the reason people can t stand others... nor is it the actual genetic survival trait of tribalism that keeps people in their own groups as a protection measure from outsiders and things that are different from them and unknown. i m gonna go read these now so i can make sense of the feelings i have that were too easily attributed to science that people often just ignore.
politics and religion aside  tolkien s work is based on european mythology with great emphasis on good vs evil  based on his life experiences including ww1. lotr inspires frienship  loyalty  sacrifice  resisting temptation and more  and aragorn is literally a personification of good. peter jackson may have done some changes to lotr to make the story fit a movie-medium  but he kept that tolkien spirit intact. lotr is literally a force of good to inspire anyone and everyone  anytime and anywhere.
i love hearing you talk about your views when it comes to gaming. i m a christian and i feel the same way  my family was one of those that hates harry potter for witchcraft and i didn t watch the movies or read the books until i got married and i couldn t understand why people hated it so much. now i m a huge potter fan!
no matter what comes through that gate  you will stand your ground!
it would be amazing if you created a channel or did an entire series on you just reading the lord of the rings books! i would so appreciate that channel.
perfectly stated
thank you for saying this
well said
gasp the horrors
agreed.
decency  facts and truth. the kryptonite of the left.
comment of the day! 100
orwell is quoted by the left and right so much and people debate his own views so many times i don t think mentioning him or his works  usually only 1984 because apparently he never did anything else significant besides i guess animal farm i think at least the same hasn t happened for when nihilists debate that they bring up  i have no mouth and i must scream
@chandller burse  he was a collectivist  but a social collectivist. he certainly wasn t what we d call  right wing   but he was anti-authoritarian and understood the dangers of top-down government control.we don t really have a category for him socially in our modern right left split. but governmentally he d be more aligned with the modern right  even though socially he d be more left.
@seraphswitness  who says that he d be more aligned with the modern right   i ve only ever read 1984 and animal farm   but i certainly don t see any sort of validation for either a right wing world view or government in either of this book. mostly   he seems bitter and deeply disillusioned with communism  and   perhaps  his own life long left wing views. doesn t follow that he s   right wing     that s simply a paradigm that s been imposed upon him by modern interpretation. imo.
@andrew woodhead  i didn t say he was right wing. i said his view on limited government was more right wing by modern standards. and socially he was more of a labor party guy. there s a reason it s the modern left warning against the  extremism  of 1984. that alone should tell us a lot.it s like you didn t even read my post. i was basically saying what your last sentence was saying.
@seraphswitness  then that says something.certainly i do not get the demonization of socialist ideas entirely.
@chandller burse  it depends entirely on what you mean by  socialist ideas . sharing  taking care of your fellow man  acting with duty and responsibility for the general welfare of your neighbor  yes yes and yes.cramming that down with government programming  the subsidization and control of private enterprise  massive wealth redistribution  no no and no.
@seraphswitness  so we just hope people want to do it rather than implement some helpful things hell people wouldn t have even survived the depression or world wars without some of the socialist programs.also by this standard isn t making people ration for wars also a bad government program
@seraphswitness  also letting corporations have a monopoly of power is a bad idea.
@chandller burse   so we just hope people want to do it rather than implement some helpful things  - we don t need to hope. people survived for literally millennia without government programs  merely through social structures. hell people wouldn t have even survived the depression or world wars without some of the socialist programs. - there s a great deal of evidence to suggest that fdr s policies extended the great depression. there was a harvard study years ago that concluded this. also by this standard isn t making people ration for wars also a bad government program  - that s too broad to answer. depends on the war  depends on the nature of the rationing. the only time government involvement in economy is justified is when there is legitimate national security concerns. and perhaps the rare instance of a genuine monopoly.
how horrible!
lmfao!!
uf how dare you spread such terrible thing. xd
the radicals! lol!  oh noooo........common sense  the good  the true and the beautiful...we can t stand it! it burns us! it burns us!
@krazeesk8r  they love to glorify their own compassion
you had me up to  chivalry   but self-sacrifice doesn t exist.
@hiraghm  how does that not exist  frodo basically sacrificed his life. gandalf too. did you love too hard or something
that sounds like the alt-lite  not the far right.
@so done  you mean  the far left .
@hiraghm  you re joking right  self-sacrifice is everyday living for a man who loves his family.  50 to a 80 hour week  to make sure that they re taking care of. he s knows that death is his only retirement  but he s wants what s best for his family. it s that self-sacrifice doesn t exist in a socialist world. everyone is given their small share  no one does more than needed. if someone works hard to better themselves  it s taken away from them  and given to others who would never self-sacrifice for another.
yep.
@so done  death is a retirement depends on the belief i guess.for some its rest for others its another worse or better life and for some its just this life again.and some its just dread.
@chandller burse   death is a retirement .  it has nothing to do with what a person believes in.  in american  not everyone has the money to retire. so people work  because they have to  until they can t work.
@so done  i did not need that explained to me when all i did was express nihilism and how people do not view death the same and to be fair we don t really know what happens after at least as far as people want to say.
@chandller burse  sorry  i misunderstood. but you are correct  people view death quite differently from one another. we all have our own experiences. i use to think death was the end  but after watching my mother die  i don t know.
@so done  what if someone is unable to work
@so done  i am sorry for your loss.
love of natural enviroment and gardening  interest in music  i mear real music like 16-19c music   in christianity ethics  in archeology of celts and vikings  reading medieval poetry - horrible horrors of free mind  d
@hiraghm  and what if i told you thats actualy the same     chivalry can lead to sacrifice eventualy.
applause all around
oh the horror
@nada problem  so did boromir  basically.
don t forget forgiveness and understanding
@chandller burse  ok  that was ungraceful    but i did not think about elvis and such i thought about today s popstars. well  actualy after the end of 90s all of the popstars are the same for me  every such girl or boysband is the same
how dare lotr teaches readers to be decent human beings!
@chandller burse  that s impossible. you can t have corporations  plural  have a monopoly.government  on the other hand  quite literally has a monopoly on power.
@seraphswitness  people survived but thats not the same as living better or making things better.why does survival equal  thats all we need i thought our species was suppose to live not be on the food chain all the time.hell maybe we as a species aren t meant for this world the better creations are the regular animals they work efficiently.
@seraphswitness  people in dictatorships also survive but is that fine to you
and aldous huxley warned about progressivism
@chandller burse   letting corporations have a monopoly of power is a bad idea giving that power over to government  is even worse.
@dude slick  seems a fair comment
@dude slick i don t think theres a difference there with corps having power they get it from the government as much as the government gets from them
@neongenesisevangelion  nah i don t think there was much libertarian about him. he was pretty socially-conscious. libertarians tend to have freedom as the highest good  at the expense of moral structure or group justice. that wouldn t have described orwell  from what i know.
tolkien hated peter jackson and by extension would ve hated melonie mac.
absolutely true.  language and culture are important and matter.  do not let them steal and pervert out heritage.
sad  but that is exactly what s happening.
yeah  especially since recently the ministry of truth released newspeak editions of roald dahls books
1984 is happening little at a time as we speak
these people are just a meme now.
we must defend against these shit
it does make sense. they don t want people to see the parallels and realize what s going on
you paralleled it perfectly  yet you still don t get it.
when did  the government  say either of those things...
dont worry  the normies have figured that out  as well. the instant they discover race or gender swapping  they vanish.
stop running and start pushing them down instead.
dead space remake
@zurvanlol dead space remake swapped minor npcs who died in like five mins of the game who even cares
updated for a modern audience   for people that hate the material and anyone that likes it.
exactly. when everything is racist  nothing is racist. i m done being offended by the accusations. they ve cried wolf too many times for me to care.
in the kingdom of the damned  virtue is itself damned.
its not like i have changed. i have been  radicalized  by the left moving so far left that i guess im on the right now.
that s the biggest  brightest red flag there is.
@chandller burse  mmhmm i m sure that s all they changed. you don t  update for a modern audience  by just removing an npc lmao. me thinks you are too clouded to see clearly. you obviously get triggered by anyone questioning the quality of such a remake   so you ll have to forgive the rest of us for not taking you at your word
@bw estacado  the remake isn t hated or considered wokified they changed some things sure and added a bathroom thing people disliked but other than that there isn t anything else.it could ve been worse and besides i don t even play the damn thing and its still a better remake to have been done than the stupid rushed greedy decision to remake a 9 year old game by sony the same year.
@bw estacado  people are just overdramatic about the remake i don t see anything else and unless you can cite any other woke changes that actually matter then whats even your deal
byeeeeeeeeeeeee. lol
you forgot that golem survives and is a trans and the split personality was them battling for they them true self
...only to suddenly be rescued by asian-lesbian gandalf and the trans non-binary eagles.
right before the long awaited kiss sam and frodo will reveal there pro-nouns
can t wait
i will write it differently. sam finally confesses to frodo atop mount doom  just as frodo was about to turn to the dark side. frodo  in tears  renounces the ring and instead  gently slips it on sam s ring finger. their pure love purifies the ring and cleanses sauron  who leaves the dark throne of mordor and travels onwards in search of his one true love  calebrimbor. peace reigns and everyone becomes gay!edit  and yes  the 20 second french kiss!
frodo will toss the salad more likely.

that s only the first fake out ending
not much different from kevin smith s bashing of lotr.
@viktor vondoom  sauron embarks on a middle earth wide apology tour  apologizing for his toxic masculinity.
there a fantastic video of sam and frodo in osgillosth talking about how if they don t defeat sauron   the world won t be a safe place for men to pretend to be women and invade their private spaces.sadly   i ve lost it . the voices are spot on !
yes  and they are both black now.
the cloak they use to hide from the enemies on the mountain side will be a rainbow flag lol
gollum s neopronouns are  precious preciouself
@bw estacado  the wrong kevin smith survived. rip kevin t. smith  ares from hercules and xena .
@thatharvguy  awww rip to a legend of two great tv shows. i loved em as a kid  but i admit it s been at minimum 20 years since i ve seen it. the universe is a cruel mistress with many avenues to disappointment.... losing the wrong kevin smith is a great injustice  but a harsh lesson i won t take lightly
i mean this is what fandoms do.from both sides anyways especially gaming especially around such games as tlou2 an fallout 4.
@bw estacado  abby isn t trans and your comment here is just full of crap i don t really care about debating as i ve done millions of timesi am an actual gamer i expected it to be far worse but it wasn t that horrible.maybe its because i don t think the first one is literally the best game ever but still
@bw estacado  its gameplay is still slightly better than well the first one.at least i can agree with the average gameplay both the games have compared to jak and daxter and uncharted.also why bring up fallout 4  that game has nothing to do with the last of us 2 and its hated by fallout fans anyways thats their deal.
proud to be part of army
@booming bob  salute
biggi t
@dahelmang  biggit
yup grabbing a copy when i get paid
@jonathan stevey  buy older editions of books  there s no telling what they might get rid of in future publications.
if they touch the lord of the rings books we must start a revolution an come together as men of the west
@view bot  will do
from what i read online they backed off of the roald dahl books and now they re after 007 books.
until the stop printing the old version and only put the  updated  version out like they ve done with ronald dahl
well you can still find outdated versions too  but they will be expensive with the time.even 007 is getting a updated version  why  .
@tallis keeton  yeah  you are right  the true lord of the rings will never be forgotten  the one that tolkien created all by himself. not those garbages that amazon and warner bros discovery are pulling out of nowhere to justify to a angry group that can t create anything meaningful and their broken agendas.
@neoware  well  i hope that wb future adaptations can be better than amazon  its hard to make smt worse  d and i hope that wb future adaptations can be more balanced as to the topics of the politicalisation or ideologicalisation becouse they would have learned smt from the other disasters of adaptations and remakes. well  its just a hope.    though i can see signs that its just a fool s hope
@tallis keeton  well  i just hope that wbd don t say the doomed words   we re making new movies for  modern  audiences ...
@neoware  i hope so too
lol being called a bigot is like a award now.
i ve been called a nazi and a sjw so double award.
yep  me as a man myself more easily to be tempted or arouse by sex scene  so i tend to skip pass through it when a movie have some of it
even when you try to explain this as simply as possible some people just continue to be willfully ignorant and continue strawmanning your views
they got a believe system   an inconsistent political ideology we got cultural roots of myths and much respect for this giftthey got postmodernism    we dont care about sticking to the truth we got respect for an author s wishes of how to adapt his books.they got pseudointellectual word salad of newspeak we got beauty of old languages and poems they got tiktok s weirdos as profesors of brains conditioning we got a real scholar  artist and romanticfor bringing us all together for some hard  hard learningabout evil  truth  beauty  and honor. fandoms! to the king!
and those books have a very very anti-modern worldview with all those monocultures and monarchies and hierarchies and great chains of being and civilizational cycles.  all very very deliciously offensive to the prog mindset
now and for always     - tolkien fandom stands alone. - not alone. fandoms ! - to the king !
fable 3.  i m a christian and love the darkness games  they re mere fiction.  good topic  melonie! edit  wow  a mere word sparked a debate for merely stating my enjoyment for a merely fictitious video game. mere online behaviour is merely confounding.
sure it does! if  bigotry  means  awareness of tyranny   that is.
if they tell you not to read something  that s a sign that you should read it.
lotr is  to this day  my favorite book and definitely worth a read. i promise it won t radicalize you into any political viewpoint. my only suggestion though is that if you do read it  don t just read through fellowship and put it down. it was all written as one book and that is the way it flows best. it can take a bit to get into tolkien s super descriptive writing but it s very worth it.
if anything it makes me want to embrace those classic books even more  rather than reading something that wants me to hate myself and my culture.
this also reminds me of a manga that had this as the plot where books and other media was labeled as harmful and banned or confiscated there was even a list of words that were no longer acceptable  all this leading to libraries forming their own organization with a military to protect books and the people who read them.
i don t think these people have truly read lotr or 1984  especially 1984 which warns and speaks out against radicalism as a dystopian novel.
well i am in the  biggitarmy. have a good weekend melonie
if a person feels an extreme urge of doing something bad after watching or playing something  that person should seek help  but the majority of people don t  because most people know the difference between fantasy and reality. it s entertainment  and nothing else. best
orwell would be absolutely delighted that the very forces he warned about in his book are now trying to ban him. they re literally proving him correct  and it makes reading those books even more important than ever.
thanks for being candid about your christian views   faiths  mel!
what fanatics forget about tolkien is that lord of the rings was an alagory for his time in the military . tolkien took his experiences and adapted that into a fantasy epic.
it s okay to be a peter jackson fan concerning lotr it s how an entire generation was introduced to that awesome world.it s the only fantasy world i wish i could live in irl  i d probably live on farm lane in the shire it s kinda how i live now on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
does my bigotry power level increase if i watch the movies again   if so i m going to train!
melonie this gives me a grand idea. i hope you are willing to hear this out. you should post either youtube videos or audio records reading the lord of the rings series. this would piss off so many of the woke nuts that it would only provide some of the best entertainment we could ask for. now i am not saying release many hours at once but even just posting 20 min or 1 hour readings at a time would be awesome. i won t lie i would listen to each reading waiting for more. if this seems like too much i have no problems not wanting to do this  but we never know until we ask or try so.
wow this video is thick with good topics!! agree with you mel 100 . as for watching  playing entertainment  you re good to go. biblical reference upon request lol. these  other  christians tend to not understand that brow beating isn t biblical. it s just a way for them to feel good about themselves in a twisted way. once again mel  you re doing great. don t doubt yourself in regards to these low-key finger pointers against you. happy friday btw lol.
i never knew just how radical i am  haha. also  you really should read the books they are amazing! the audiobooks are really well done too  i personally love the ones narrated by rob inglis.
i have to say this  because i am not a right-winger by any stretch of the imagination  i m a centrist  who leans right. but  if reading books like lotr and 1984  previously considered subversive by right-wingers of the time  makes one a right-winger... then i guess i am full on right-wing. as the saying goes  in a time of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act  and apparently an act of subversion.
yeah that sounds about right  since  sanity is radical to the insane.  nuff said.
now for the real comment  melonie mac looking beautiful as ever
i mean people also use to argue playing video games leads to violence or watching superman leads to kids trying to fly.actually the latter came from mr rogers sort of but he had good intentions and i am not sure if he demonized superheroes in general.
i agree  except the claim of  mere  fiction. stories are powerful  they reflect the views of the author. and the left knows this very well.we d be wise not to dismiss narrative as  mere  fiction. fiction steers cultures.
@seraphswitness  they are still fiction and differing between fact and fiction is important to be like these people or parents who said video games create murderers.
@seraphswitness  i never said you said that
@seraphswitness  disney stories contained heartfelt messages though  toy story 1 was about selfishness and friendship and loyalty. toy story 3 was about maturing and moving on and accepting change.disney also appropriated fairytales that were all fables of lessons and such.disney s messages weren t the issue it was people deciding to be self righteous.
@chandller burse   disney stories contained heartfelt messages though   - well  pixar was a separate studio first of all. second  i never said that all the messaging was bad. just that the thrust of the disney renaissance was   just be yourself . this was a good idea in it s purest form  but got taken to an abusive level. we also see the continued theme of parents being fools  and learning lessons from their disobedient kids. disney also appropriated fairytales that were all fables of lessons and such. - the stuff they kept from those stories was mostly great. the stuff they originated... not so much. the original hca little mermaid was nothing like the disney adaptation. disney s messages weren t the issue it was people deciding to be self righteous. - this is just naive. media affects the people who consume it. this is the entire premise behind actual propaganda. people know that art affects people and changes minds. slowly  subtly  but inevitably. this is why we re seeing censorship of old stories.
@seraphswitness  i know it does affect people but peoples choices are their own.and you can t blame disney for everything.
darn right!
this is actually why i read 1984 and gone with the wind... it s too good and true  that s why those freaks wants to cancel it!
well... sort of. it wasn t an allegory strictly speaking. tolkien famously hated allegory  he thought it was cheap and shallow  and stole autonomy from the reader. i cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations  and always have done so since i grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. i much prefer history   true or feigned  with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. i think that many confuse applicability with allegory  but the one resides in the freedom of the reader  and the other in the purposed domination of the author.
actually it is  but most christians are fine letting others figure out the hard way since that s how people learn the best
considering jesus tells us to  judge rightly
@razoro2productions  1 cor 8. start there
have a great weekend sis god bless  i actually just watched the original trilogy last night
freedom of thought is a threat to those who seek to control others gatekeep.. always.
they come for entertainment because  politics is downstream from culture . it s not weird at all  it s dangerous.
i also would like to add this  since you brought up devil may cryyou are spot-on with the demons being creatures more akin to fairy tales. even the ruler of hell is a fictional character named mundus. the whole setup for the universe is that the human and demon world were almost like two planes of existence rather than hell being the literal afterlife. they are physical  fictional beings that have no impact on christianity.
the reason that entertainment   pop culture is such an important battleground is that it directly effects the culture   moral cohesion of a nation   it s people.it s why the focus is upon deconstructing iconic characters   stories. if you can destroy them  you can destroy the morale   backbone of an entire culture.
those people have no idea how to write a story. they are not creative enough 2 32
it s all about a person knowing their limits. for instance i never get drunk  but will have the occasional drink. for a recovering alcoholic i can understand them not wanting to have just one drink or even be around it.
the book talks about the horrors of war  friendship and courage. if that is classified as being a  bigot   then i am on as well. also  in the book  when theoden was leaving edoras  he assigned eowyn to stand and watch over the people. she was armed and ready. even in the silmarillion  haleth  a female  who took the role as a leader after her father and brother were killed by orcs  and dwelled in the forest of brethil to guard menegroth in doriath
now i understand why i don t like criminals  finally! it s because they re not immortal elves or a king of a fictional national with an epidermis of a lighter hue  friggin duuuuh!
they be like   why can t people read harmless quality literature...like the communist manifesto!
in doom it s very anti-demon. you can tell because your job in the game is to depopulate hell.
have they ever seen spartacus   i m surprised they haven t banned that show for toxic masculinity. side note it is one of the greatest shows of all time and i hear it s returning in some way.
that speech where aragorn spoke of a day may come when forsaking bonds of fellowship  the hour of wolves  and shattered shields as the age of men comes crashing down has finally come.
the man who wrote this book will still be remembered for years to come and the people who tried to demonize his work shall immortalize it because the books will endure their stupidity.
did you think the enemy was going to be gentle  pray and stand up. the lord goes before us. he stands with us in the fire.
good thoughts here  melonie. so much what people call  sin  is really a matter of conscience. the bible defines sin. there are things that can lead someone to sin  but are not sinful in themselves. if it violates your conscience  you shouldn t do it. romans 14
i m with you. in a fight scene i can at least appreciate the choreography or the special effects. i ve noped out of sex scenes because there are no special effects for that. and if things like respect  honorable  behavior  logic  reason  and standing up for the truth are considered right wing extremism by these morons reality has a lot of nasty surprises in store for them.
what a coincidence  i just bought the lord of the rings book this week!
melonie you hit the nail on the head. we have to defend our classics hard core like. absolutely can t keep giving them chances to ruin more things. at least they re losing money with these woke reimagined shows and movies.
it s awesome to see another youtuber who seems to feel the same way as i do regarding discernment.
this is why i always caution people against saying   it s just a  book  game  tv show  . it s incredibly naive to think fiction doesn t have massive cultural power.
yea doom is pretty strong on the good vs. evil front. lolmost moms in the 90s weren t objecting to the demon imagery  but to the excessive violence. for that time  doom and mortal kombat were the most gratuitous games on the market.
it s my favourite show of all time doesn t get enough praise great to hear someone else speak highly of it
i m spartacus
i mean i figured they d be fine with it  it has gay couples in it after all... no wait you re probably right  it doesn t have anyone trans in it
they are extremely gentle  that s why they have to resort to controlling words  subterfuge  and group think. they lack the physical and emotional strength to try anything with force.
i guess i can use this against flat earthers who say that science and not believing the earth is flat because the bible supposedly says it is. is a sin of itself or proves one does not have faith.
not sure what this has to do with flat earthers but ok.
@john phillips  just expressing my further resentment of those guys sorry.
one of the best things i ever heard about tolkien s works was this statement  tolkien - its contemplation . it was said by one of polish writers when he was 95 year old. he was a christian monk  whose interviews and lectures i like.
these are extremely tired arguments that have been around for decades. i m just going to go through a quick list of the common ones  1. no  the orcs aren t supposed to be nonwhite people  they re supposed to be a representation of man s inhumanity. 2. middle s earth s geography of west   free peoples and east   sauron is tied to broader themes like the sun setting in the west   acceptance of death  with the undying lands being based on old medieval legends and the like. 3. the men living in harad and rhun were not universally evil  and for that matter the free peoples were not universally good either   they just had the misfortune of living closer to sauron  but the blue wizards were able to rally some resistance to him. 4. tolkien was a veeeeerrrrry vocal critic of hitler and the nazis.5. the whole dwarves   jews thing is a mischaracterization of what tolkien said  he was comparing languages and the fact that they were a displaced people. there isn t anything deeper than that.
c.s. lewis and j.r.r. tolkien make you a right-wing extremist  well  damn. i planned on reading their collective works over the rest of the year  i guess now i have to try and read it all twice now.
when you just accept that this is an alternate religion  you realize the goal is simply to teardown anything that promotes critical thinking or traditional world view. they realize that so long as an alternative that is better in every way is out there  people will not choose their religion. i know that sounds crazy  but they ve attacked everything that is beautiful or good.
have a great weekend melonie mac
gatekeeping is not only not a bad thing  it is necessary.
imagine reading 1984 and thinking  hey! this book is saying bad things about me
reading 1984 is now classed as  far right.   i wondered when they were going to include this particular classic that they re using as a blueprint for their communist utopia. they re making the mistake of thinking some of us will forget about this years down the line.
well it s saturday morning here and it s just started raining   a perfect time to curl up in bed and re-read   lotr
this is actually true.  i have seen lotr multiple times  and i can personally confirm it has led to a hatred of orcs  and a severe distrust of wizards.
if you haven t read every author they mention  they just gave you the perfect reading list. time for me to go find things aldous huxley and joseph conrad have written.
i m not a christian  but i wish the ones i ve known personally were more like you. the people i ve encountered have typically  not  been principled in their own beliefs even though they insist on pushing them onto others. it could just be location environment related i guess.but it s good to know that christians can be cool people too .  d
we are literally living in george orwell s novel. to read the book  1984  is to become self aware
need to laugh at them and never take them seriously
one of the books they mention explains why they change the meaning of words
i always play an honorable character in games  despite the fact that i was sorted into slytherin.
this is sad 1984 is literally what s happening today it s probably the most important warning ever written
i spent 2 years just doing a slow read-through the silmarillion from 2021 to 2022. if they re slandering and socially demonizing normal film book fans  they definitely wouldn t like the     d of fan that i am.
if 1984 is too far right for these people i d hate to see how nuclear they d go for anything by cs lewis.
i don t need to read lotr to become a right-wing extremist...i just turn on the news and see what s happening across britain
15 00 thanks so much for explaining that.  i ve been making this exact point till i m blue in the face and i swear people are just being willfully ignorant at this point
been embracing a few balrogs lately and putting the welcome mat out for a shelob and giving cups of tea for wraiths
it s almost as if slytherin   bad
i fear what these kind of ppl will do with this new adaptation of narnia on tv series
i find your occasional struggle to keep from cursing to be very endearing.
was refreshing at 19 10 to hear you call out the  sinners prayer  concept for what it is. it s mainly the reformed christians that call out its deceitfulness. dont know if you fall under the reformed camp  but regardless  it s always nice to hear good theology.
speaking of sacrifice in video games! in age of conan  there is a quest in kara korum where you get to lead a jiang shee blind villager to walk into a pit of fire and burn to death!
when i play a game with good and bad choices my first play is always the good route. i do that bad run on my 2nd olay through if i do it. there are some things i just wont do though.
see  the  1984  thing makes more sense. their game plan is 1984 and they don t want anyone else to realise...
the people that constantly feels the need to redefine words or change words or make up new words are not the people that have truth on their side.
this has reminded me that i should reread the trilogy.
they ve ruined the present for everyone  now they re going after the past because we re not allowed to have nice things
i can translate the headline for you    the overton window has moved so far to the left that cautionary tales are becoming reality.
tolkien was an educational genius who wrote this franchise but these woke generation of people media will never understand
i m of the belief that if they want to ban these books  they should have to read them first.
i think the most harm video games can have on your spirituality is possible addiction  but definitely not demonic possession.
as soon as i saw the article s title in the thumbnail  i burst out laughing.
my issue with harry potter was it being marketed toward children.  this is where parental guidance and individual maturity come into play  though.
i m a little late to the party  but one thing to consider in violent content vs sexual content is that violence is simulated  no one s actually getting hurt. nudity  even if it s a body double  is real  and given what we now know about perverted hollywood directors...think about all the cut footage and leering eyes just in the filming process. i find it creepy and gross  myself.
got to love the cheesy b rate horrors... zombeaver  volicpastor  tucker and dale vs evil  army of darkness
come to think of it..yes i do remember passages of lotr being read through the headsets of united 93 on sept.11th 2001
i would definitely recommend reading the hobbit lord of the rings novels.
i live in the same area as melonie  by  same area  that would be anywhere from half an hour to an hour  drive away  the dfw area is enormous  and it would be a blast to just spend a long lunch picking her brain about game   geek culture. i would expect to need an hour for a tomb raider side tangent  though.
as someone who doesn t read books like that and never really has i can remember 4 books i have read my entire life 3 of them was the lotr books and id read them again
they started saying this the moment rings of power come out to guilt people into accepting their  interpretation  and get away with trying to destroy tolkien s legacy.
you mentioned doom in here. the closest depiction of demons  kinda biblical  would be the game  agony  ...
so i read the books when i was in highschool. that was about a decade tho. so i guess i m still right wing lol
imagine playing a game where you re the hero and keep in mind it s for the glory of the living god.could be an interesting perspective
all this modern ai needs to hurry up and become self-aware.
besides the book 1984  i can also recommend brave new world.
you and gary should do a segment on this.
no  they are serious. yes they believe their own insanity. yes it gets worse as long as we let them!
it s absolutely true. 1984 can lead to right-wing  because is an anti-totalitarianism novel  and at the moment right  even far-right  is the less totalitarian part of society politic.  sad  but true.
what the heck makes a movie or tv scene  gratuitously sexual   obviously  hardcore porn would be out  but what about frank nudity  as in a movie like sirens or the spine of night  national geographic nudity  the sex scenes in quest for fire  the underground depravity of new york in heavy traffic  the adolescent escapism of heavy metal  the seduction process in a movie like the reader  a weird sex ritual like the witch scene in conan the barbarian  what about the montage that conveyed conan and valeria s relationship in the same film  the love scene in terminator  where kyle and sarah have the most plot-critical sex ever  a brief montage of a strip club in a cop show  and would any of these truly tempt anyone toward lust
games some time show whats really in someones hearts..
in the game agony  you ll see actual depictions of demons and hell. but at the end of the dsy  it s just a video game.
so there s a shieldmaiden named ima biggit in tolkien s stories
1984    hitting a little too close to home  perhaps   makeorwellfictionagain
see they always talk about right wing extremism but never talk about left wing extremism. in fact  they allow left wing extremism to thrive by calling it love   tolerance  unless you disagree .
to the effect of what s been discussed here  i have a few anecdotes...a while back  my pastor spoke against a child having what i think was one of those christmas inflatables featuring a dragon in a santa hat likely because he was conflating it with the dragon from the book of revelation. at another time  he was evangelizing a group of chinese people  who only knew of christmas via santa claus and not christ himself  which i ll admit is a big problem .i even saw him try to bring to christ an old man who literally believe in fairy tale creatures such as elves to the point where he d go worship them in the woods.my point is  while i don t deny that there s the dangerous risk of blending fantasy with reality  you only need to look around you to see how certain people identify themselves with trying to customize themselves like a character in an rpg   the risk of corruption depends on the person as well as their particular temptations to sin.i hope this rant ramble made some level of sense.
again i agree  cause most sex scenes in movies or tv have no effect on the plot
reading those books could also lead to critical thought.
everyday we stray further from god. welcome to clown world.
so  what is next  burning inappropriate books  this is crazy!
the modern audience is we-todd-did!
i love how you literally mention tomb raider in just about every single video you do.
i guess i ve been one for a long time  then.  i think i read the hobbit and lotr books the first time about 1983 or so.  40 years ago.
her tats are amazingly good. whoever did them did good.
don t read 1984! it will make you realize we re making a fricking fool out of you.
it does !buys 10 more copies
i wish this was a joke sometimes you tell a joke.sometimes you are the joke.
this world just gets crazier by the day...
welp. i m off to buy a hard copy of the extended editions before it s too late.
if that so  then i love it even more now.
1 50 the first bad word i ve ever heard her say lmao she s heckin mad now
to bookshelf as fast as i can to continue being a bigot
random quote i found   it seems that ricu is so far off-track that it believes that books identifying the problem that it was itself set up to tackle are in fact a part of the problem.  lulz  that is some scary irony.
being morally good in a classical sense and defending and holding the truth in high regard is simply extreme in 2023.
if they want to treat us like demons then maybe we should start acting the part.
i mean they re not lying. i read the lord of the rings as a child. almost religiously. i made a good career for myself and travelled the world. i m just awful.
dear god give me a breakmelonie these things are getting so freaking annoying.theirs absolutely nothing withthe darn books aswell the movies.that being said  havea blessed weekend.takecare melonie
i wish all these woke libs were required to spend a day listening to the words of thomas sowell   i bet at least half of them would view things completely different the following day!!
i ve been killing pixels in video games since i could stand up to an arcade machine. inky  blinky  pinky  clyde and donkey kong are still mad at me  not to mention all of the mortal kombat characters. i never once wanted to kill anyone in reality.
4 40  you should read the books.  they look intimidating  but the most common criticism is that they are too short.  so start reading  if you don t enjoy just set the book aside.
they don t have the cognitive ability to get anything from this
several of them would denounce him as an uncle tom...
the reason they hope your life is ruined is because they cant get away with calling for our death quite yet. theyll get there though
i am surprised it took the british government this long to go after orwell.
the lord of bigotry
lord of the rangs
in  my case i m an atheist but i don t like sex scenes on my entertainment because that s supposed to be a private and adult act.with violence and gory stuff i m okay because is supposed to be fictional  i obviously would be shocked and horrified to see someone do something like the things we see on any entertainment media.
presumably they set up a randomised controlled trial and observed statistically significant differences in scientifically agreed markers of bigotry of a control group who had no exposure to tolkien s works and an experimental group who had been exposed to tolkien s works. now they should show us the results  the p-value  n  and the effect size  including polarity . they should also list and define the markers and justify the selection.
ill watch scary movies cuz they dont tempt me to sin
wait i m confused  i thought gondor was going through a trans transition according to tolkien scholar   d
i read lotr and the hobbit when i was like 10 -12 years old! i ve been a bigot since a very young age apparently! same with orwell! oops!
lauren southern exposed hope not hate
supporting harry potter is like supporting something that is a true gateway to evil which  it very much it is with real magic spells being in the book.
what until they get a gander at your hogwarts legacy character...
now i want to read the books then go back to the hobbit and read those books
good thoughts  refreshing video!
i m gonna read it even harder now.
ok  then i ll glad be a right wing extremist
i always keep a copy of magnificat  a daily mass magazine  with me.
whoever wrote that headline article needs to leave whatever the hell  they re smoking alone. the only thing that is extremist is what s coming out of their mouth
we all knew this was coming when amazon targeted tolkien s work.
it is everyones own personal responsibility to keep themselves on the side of good. that no matter what evil and darkness is in the world  to not add to it. we can have all these rules that say do this and do that and you will be good in the eyes of god. evil can follow all these rules while rotten to the core and yet remain undetectable as well. this world feels to me like the ultimate test of whether or not someone is truly good or just pretending to be.
imo its wholesome approach
it was afaik actualy smt called  prevent  its an internet bot of uk gov which probably showed them that link between interests in particular authors and being in particular political groups or environs. i m ok with that ppl of different political views usualy read different writers and philosopher and such. but i dont think that reading some of the writers makes u extremist on whatever side. its rather imo you can become extremist on any side by not reading much    only listening to much to such as those ppl who says this thing. i ve learned from my grandma and my ma to read books in all the spectrum of ideas - including politics. and tolkien is not political and should not be politicised by whatever side.
it d be hilarious if the game npc were capable of saying player names  lol.
please my fellow fans and fandoms do not say  outdated  versions of the books.    as if there should be any kind of  updated  versions.  d this is their newspeak  they want us to use it - fake words - to better indoctrinate us to make easier their slow instalation of idiocracy - they need idiocracy to rule globaly becouse without differences of cultures and without creativity of cultures it can be easy to rule globaly  to rule of one gray  obedient mass - but idiocracy means dumping us all into living hell ! of a world without culture. but only with politics - and politics for them means only  managing of masses    control of human sources . say real versions of the books  original versions  true versions. do not allow them to befirend your mind with any word of their fake  destructive deconstruction of our native languages ! popculture fights still ! - tolkien fandom stands alone. - not alone. fandoms ! - to the king !
first
secure physical copies of tolkien s books and jackson s adaptations if you haven t already.
reading woke articles makes you laugh out loud...
i read them twice. and i m gonna read them again.
this penetration into cultural spaces is by design. this is exactly how you foment cultural revolutions  and the works of literature they are going after are ones that warn about the dangers of these cultural shifts.
i m reading all the books then!
pastor francis chan once said   i m not judging you  i am working for you
i m currently reading the terminal list series. what s that make me  awesome is what.
the evident tears in your eyes made this hit all the harder  dear lady.  it is more than okay for you to be upset by this nonsense  resilience is just as much a feminine trait as a masculine one  but stoicism does not have to be.
tolkien warned us about this it s a sad woke world
didn t tolkien literally wrote a letter saying his works are purely fiction and wishes nobody takes any political interpretations of his story about good vs evil
melonie! how could you  what had that poor  defenseless npc ever done to you  did you even think about his eternal soul  oh... right. code doesn t have soul  the npc was right back where you found it  for the next player  and a real  supernatural force of evil would have better  or  from our perspective  worse  things to do than hang out in a video game. good concept for a horror movie  though.
have a wonderful time with family. we ll watch your videos next week.stay safe. take care. have fun.
great take
if someone doesn t like lord of the rings that is fine  it is your choice. but don t dare to edit texts in books  that is for me   like burning flag of country i live in or felony  . lotr teach me  valuable lessons that i grateful for them.
satan does not have to look far  he just has to looks off to the side at the woke  for minions and supplicants
i know for a fact my sisters are fans of the books.they are not the type of people who would be mean to others.this is a clear attempt by hollywood trying to demonize the fans of the original works.
oh noooooo i ve learned nobility and brotherhood from lord of the rings. what will i become.
proud to be a sane right wing supremest.  i read lotr and the hobbit once a year  every year from the age of 8.
of course they d have a problem with people reading 1984   it s their instruction manual!
i ve become passive to this stuff anymore.literally just shrug and move on.the shock factor wore off a while go
ex-occultist here. demons in video games are not like demons in real life. when i was in the occult i allowed multiple demons to possess me. my demons never took on visual form  they simply entered into me. demons have to enter into someone  or something .
i m thinking about incorporating the word bigot into my elvish tattoo. i ll wear it proudly
anyone want to bet those books are going to be a hot commodity now. and the sales are going to jump.
this reminds me of the story fahrenheit 451.
tolkien can radicalize readers  that s news to me. wait until they hear about heinlein  or  heavens forbid  macdonald.
popular like the dogs breakfast. congratulations partydoll keep harvesting that spaghet so pure and clean rose in a vegetable garden stance. show us your true essence lara
they really hate all things good  don t they
morgoth was bad but man i wish the valar showed up one more time
orwell is alive and well
if the government is criticizing  then the books are very good eye-openers. s o paulo brazil.
i am definitely different. i have tried to play the dark side of the game  but couldn t. i have tried  but i seem to pick the good side everytime. i guess i don t see the appeal within the game. i guess i am too much of a nice guy.
oh no!!! i read them dozens of times as a child  probably makes me the mustache man i guess
idk  i ve played my share of cod and first person shooters. i guess my line is the supernatural entering into the demonic. i think thats a whole other realm christians ought not mess with  even in a video game.
they  have always believed this. now they are just being transparent about it as they think they have the advantage.
i m glad that i ve been atheist ever since i was a little kid  even when i didn t know the word for my worldview.  it s nice not having to deal with this nonsense in my thinking  except for having to deal with the grifters who push the nonsense.
this is why we have to have gatekeepers. it is a good thing. we need to protect these classics. the woke will rewrite them just like they re doing with roald dahl
the lotr is a series based strongly on goodness  nobleness  christian values  beauty  and loyalty. these are qualities the elites big noses in the media hate. anything that showcases christian values or that shows beautiful white people makes these people sick. the lotr inspires people to be noble and good. they hate these qualities. the lotr audience was the only audience in all of fandom who totally boycotted the rings of power to the extent that it failed. they hate lotr fans for that with a passion. just wait till they remake the series. we are going to see a landscape that looks more like africa than tolkien.
if you ever want to know why they re trying to censor cs lewis read the screwtape letters. i think it s free on youtube
il juice you like a grapefruit partydoll
i d rather be right than wrong left
the definition of bigot  is the hate and or  unacceptance of someone who holds a different opinion of you. the irony of of these hateful people who despise you for your opinion  calling you a bigot  is the definition of hypocrisy.
lol... guess i need to start going to clan meetings  then.
as a shin megami tensei fan  i really don t care about demons on games even if it s actually bible related demons and deities in general  it s just a fun mythology pok mon game with some philosophical shit in the middlei d say that even with everything that smt does  and i d call a lot of it heresy lol   these woke movies and etc. are a way worse influence than anything smt could ever do to someone  especially when it s hidden behind  good intentions
so much arm action going
horror to me is kind-of apotropaic  and usually i will start saying the jesus prayer.. it s the same thing as heavy metal music and gargoyles on gothic churches where the image of something evil will actually make your faith stronger by putting you on the defensive i guess.
englishman here. the uk labour party found out only too well what happens when they label their own voter base  bigots  for years on end.
they weren t say that with rings of power
strong male characters  distinct good vs. evil lines  and a  fellowship  not demonstrating the  right  kind of diversity. how could this not be a cis-white-male-power fantasy
read any and all books  you can then make up your own mind as to what it means to you as opposed to what  they  want you to think  the key phrase is  read books   do it now before they are no more
people who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians.  george lucas
and drinking a glass of water incorrectly could lead to drowning.
mature violence ratings -  for the kids . otherwise i fine with adults deciding about video games. some grandparents and parents need indicators when buying for them.
jesus talked about looking upon a woman and desiring after her and it being the same as committing adultery   i would argue this is a warning against pornography  there is no specific warning against looking upon violence.
if i have multiple 100  year old hardback novels  am i a hoowite supremacist
that is some of the reasons that we should cancel the woke activists  they act as if the fantasy characters or other fictional ones  are taking them too seriously and think it is a reflection on the creator s politics
1984 should be required reading in schools...i read it in high school
i pray there truly is a god. it s about time to flip the monopoly board.
brb gotta go read the books real fast...
1984  2 2 5. 2023  men can get pregnant and have periods. it s the same thing  and you re supposed to agree with both  even though they re both complete nonsense. it s kinda funny they re going after the book that showcases why they go after books.
didn t he sell out to disney
@chandller burse  i dont know  i just found this quote and i think thats about true  whoever was the original speaker
amen
same thing happened to my old hobby  nerf.no politics  no religion was the rule...then woke people took over  and it is now  no right wing  factually accurate politics  and definitely no christianity. everything else is permissible.
imagine reading the first page  then calling it a bunch of buzz words.
i just wish the woke would stick with their politics and not have to destroy the things we grew up loving. star wars may as well not exist anymore and how many other franchises have they absolutely ruined  i m more of a peter jackson lotr fan myself but this actually makes me want to read the books too.
they re adding the harry potter books soon.
for me violence is fictional  as i don t take part in violent acts. sexual acts on the other hand are better left to reality  and practiced within the confines of a monogamous relationship. preferably marriage.
it is not surprising at all that the classics like lotr would be labeled as an  alt-right pipeline   a few months ago it was the cod lobbies lol. but it does say something about the importance of these works and the effect they exert on culture and vice-versa  as well as why you see so much woke garbage in entertainment. to put it simply  authors like tolkien  lewis  and orwell had the ability to inspire the best in others with their narratives  their works revolve around the worth of values like honor  camaraderie  bravery  sense of duty  and also warned about the dangers some ideas can bring  the notion of evil and the necessity to combat it. point in case  these are ideas that have existed across human history and helped to set the foundations of our world  and to no-one s surprise these tend to be conservative values  so of course the  progressives  will want to tear it down. after all  to these people  anything that came before their birth is old  useless  inadequate and flat-out wrong.the works of art created at any given time will reflect the state of the society they were made  and in turn  seeing that reflection can change how said society s worldview. people are seeing the  best  this post-modern  post-irony world has to offer and they don t like it  so they naturally revert to the things they re fond of  things that evoke beauty and inspiration. the more you propagate an idea through entertainment  more people become acceptive of it  passively or actively  as it slowly becomes  common place . so a certain group definitely doesn t want the newest generations to have any other role models aside from their own  and for that they ironically follow 1984 like a freaking guidebook instead of the cautionary tale that it is
people spend too much time on the internet. they get bored and decide to pick a problem with everything
someone should tell them that the person who made the trans flag love lotr.
the book is 3 times older than me so we have right wings way back in 1930  how   make it make sense
underestimate these people as being  crazy  at your own risk. they are deliberate and focused - ban tolkien etc leads to their holy grail   ban the bible  then nothing remains to condemn the evil they do.
they take over things  or they ban things.and entertainment always was the way to go for such people. germany was huge with movies before ww2. it really was hollywood level.  triu ph des willens   so  triumph of the will . goebbels said in ww2  entertainment is important  it may decide the war. and the battle for berlin  there you saw  what they caused  fanatic children  10 - 12 years old  fighting with guns and rifles. red army soldiers in horror because of that. not knowing  what to do. that s no joke  that s what  entertainment  can do. not 1 or 2 children  but thousands. i know stories. soldiers gave up  but children kept fighting. the people born in 1933  when they took over  were 11 and 12 in 1945. and there are horrorstories. i knew someone  he was 10 and part of the  werw lfe . that was a organisation to fight the allies after the war. they should be partisans. like regular people  and suddenly change  be wolf  be predator  and kill and destroy. he didn t harm someone  luckily. he never got a weapon. but he was 10 and wanted to  and he was like that until he died. all because of  entertainment  during 3. reich. so if it s about something hateful in  entertainment   that s what comes in my mind  and i am concerned...
tomb raider never skips a video
i assume they are referring to the woke  modern reimagining    would make sense since everything i ve seen that has been altered for the sake of  modernization  has the most bigoted and discriminatory content i ve ever seen in my life.
melonie  the  wokies  have inserted themselves into our meals.
leftists   if you read orwell  you re a right-wing extremist me   orwell was a socialist. leftists   stop being a racist.
art exists because the author wanted to create it.and these clowns will not be able to destroy  it s good that we live in the digital age.because otherwise it would be possible to burn the library and thousands of books would be lost forever. and apparently these crazy people definitely don t like it.
can t make some of this s  t you find up ! nice vid as always
well i had anti terrorist class lately and frankly anything can be radicalisation trigger. anything! this is just stupid and franakly way they tear things outside of context.
this is psychological book burning.
fables way better on the evil side
well let s see  both works are writings about the horrors of leftism so yeah makes sense. i m the biggest right wing extremist alive  i m rereading lotr and tolkien s other work while lifting heavy weights every day.  rightwing af. also male sure you buy physical copies of books  folks...tolkien estate woll james bond the works of tolkien sooner or later.
1984 predicted so much lol especially  the downfall of society in 2023.
this just in  having a functioning brain could be a sign of right wing extremism. please report your friends and family members to the local bureau for diversity and inclusion if you notice any of the following symptoms - speaking in complete sentences without making baby noises- the ability to do mental arithmetic- logical consistency- not having a mental breakdown over a video game remember  be on the safe side  if you find yourself unable to understand what your friend or relative is saying it s almost certainly a dog whistle. for your own safety do not listen to them or engage with them. follow these simple steps to prevent their toxic reasoning from infecting you 1. stick your fingers in your ears2. scream obscenities at the top of your voice3. throw things4. complain on twitter about how badly oppressed you felt during the whole experience5. buy yourself a pot of ice cream and eat the whole thing while crying about how unfair everything is
thank eru il vatar  that i still have the old books and movies
i read both  and i would probably be considered a right wing extremist by the wokies lol
i never understood why some christian brethren are against violence in entertainment after all the old testament is full of violence. for me i can watch non christian content and can paint a bigger picture of how it relates to christianity alot more than actual christian entertainment.
have a great time with your family
black rock and vanguard really doubling down on bigotry against normal people huh esg scores is the real mark of the beast
this is gettin  really out of control
i think the point is  you re either under god s grace  or your under the law. and christ free s you from the law. this doesn t mean that you should just go off and do things as if it s a f    off for free card  it just means  that whatever you do  after being saved  you are taken care of. but it doesn t mean that you won t get some real world repercussions for doing things out of turn. personally  i think it s very difficult for many of us christians to wrap our minds around the fact that christ s deed was   is  fulfilled. everything is in god s hands. we all can accept that  footprints  poem. the one that ends with    he whispered   my precious child  i love you and will never leave you never  ever  during your trials and testings.when you saw only one set of footprints  it was then that i carried you.  but we can t accept that he does this in our times of trial  or our belief of falling from grace. those times he refers to as  carrying you   are those times when we re going thru some ish. it s not some childish  oh i was just sad  or depressed  or lonely  ish  it s those times when we as christians believe we are backsliding  and perhaps not behaving in what the world would have us look like as an average christian. we re so quick to judge others  and yet  what we re judging is what god has chosen to do with someone in that moment. maybe it s to set an example of how not to be in your life. it could be an infinite amount of things. however  if we are christians  and if we do see god in all things  then again  who are we to judge what god is working in the world. christ is our love  he is our patience  he is our joy. all things 1 corinthians 15 28 - when all things are subjected to him  then the son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him  that god may be all in all. peace be witcha
um. i super-hate to be the voice of reason here  because the amount of hate classic books are getting is horrific  but...the recent report murray refers to is by william shawcross  is a 192 page pdf. it s referring to an organisation called ricu  the uk government s  research  information and communications unit  which the guardian referred to in 2016 as  the shadowy propaganda unit inspired by the cold war .shawcross s report makes zero mention of tolkien  lewis  orwell. shawcross s report says things like  prevent tends to focus its analysis on the sharp  violent end of the islamist ideological spectrum .and  in the executive summary  my purpose has been to ensure that the government s approach to preventing radicalisation and terrorism is as successful as possible. i found a programme that is broadly right in its objectives  admirable in its intentions and that fulfils many of its functions to good effect.however  there is room for improvement.prevent must return to its core mission   countering all those ideologies that can lead people to committing or supporting acts of terrorism. this can only be done if prevent properly understands the nature of these ideologies and how they attract and suborn individuals. it is correct for prevent to be increasingly concerned about the growing threat from the extreme right. but the facts clearly demonstrate that the most lethal threat in the last 20 years has come from islamism  and this threat continues. ...prevent must address all extremist ideologies proportionately according to the threat each represents. however  my research shows that the present boundaries around what is termed by prevent as extremist islamist ideology are drawn too narrowly while the boundaries around the ideology of the extreme right-wing are too broad. this does not allow prevent to reflect accurately  and deal effectively with  the lethal risks we actually face. if i could post links  i would. all i searched for was  uk government ricu 2019  and the hit is called  independent review of prevent - gov.uk   dated 8 feb 2023. damned if i can find the 2019 ricu report yet though. so where this douglas murray got his information from i d really love to know.
yep.  that s what these remakes are all about these days.  they are trying to destroy the past great works  because they are directly attacking the existing culture.  their only purpose is to destroy.  this is why i will resist them at every step.
wow. it s gotten to a point now where books of fiction are labeled as  beloved by the alt-right . so  even tho i don t have a political leaning anymore at least   i could be considered an extremist because i like the lotr series for the record i never even read the books. but still .
oh noooo  anyway just recently bought the unedited collectors version of the the hobbit with the original drawings and maps made by tolkien
to listen to the pmrc or moral majority back in the mid-80s  listening to heavy metal was an expressway to diabolical service. well  i guess there must have been an offramp  or we all moved on to wholesome grunge and techno  because that particular moral panic didn t eventuate. nor will this one.  but the left loves to grab the fallacy of some extremists liking tolkien to say all fans are like that  and worse  the text lures in the reader. just bs. even the rop showrunners called lotr superfans  fascist adjacent . seriously. and why  cos it s a great stick to bash others with. especially if you ve made a crap show.
christian people should look up the christian connections to the lord of the rings  j. r. r tolkien was a very devout christian.this is very well known and you should be able to find plenty of material discussing this online.
the woke  lotr makes you broke!
antifa  blm... i wonder if prevent considers those  radicalized
it s funny how the word don t mean anything anymore i am just   sure bud   . it s the most wording i ve heard i feel in 2022 - 2023. i don t even browse twitter that much.
douglas murray is amazing.  and  to their credit  the  left-thinking  progressives are right to fear those who read such deep books with thought-provoking messages within them  as this leads to people thinking for themselves and wanting to challenge themselves instead of just taking the weak  shallow pablum that these  progressive  types push and allowing their political masters to do all their thinking for them.  forget that noise.i hated reading orwell in school  just as i hated watching the movie brazil.  they were dark dim views of a horrible dystopian future and i didn t like those thoughts  preferring gene roddenberry s bright and hopeful dreams for the future where we could all work together in star trek.  but now books like 1984 and animal farm should be required reading for thoughtful  intelligent people since they expose the intent and road maps to the future the progressives are supporting.
fear can come from a christian god.   god asks us to overcome our fears  but we can t overcome if we don t have it.   if i was told to overcome the obsticles of a temple  and there was just a hallway to the treasure.... i didn t overcome anything.   god does invoke fear in the unbelievers but christians are called to not be afraid for god is with us.
all the crazies  lord of the rings makes you a bigot!me to all the  bigots   you have my sword!
so reading about warnings against far left totalitarianism  can make you far right   worse  it s the government warning that reading writers that warn against totalitarian governments is bad.
don t worry  they are going to change the text soon enough !
this isn t about a hobby or entertainment.  this is about the erasure of our society   god.  atheist use to be about greek philosophy.  now they are about nietzsche   marx.  these people want to shape society according to their wild imagination  devoid of god and any belief in something beyond their control.  the best of the arts points us to the beautiful  the good    the true  these things are not in their control and points us to our creator.
on one hand this sounds laughable  on the other hand some of the properties they named - particularly yes  minister and the uk house of cards - are among my favorite things in the world and i definitely am a kind of right-wing extremist  so
what will those wingdings come up with next  just sad really  they sure do hate people that are happy.
i guess i m a right wing extremist. lol  harrison bergeron is also a good short story to read. steven parker does a good audio book for 1984.
i haven t read the books so i guess i m ok  remember to drink water. if you want me to stop reminding you just let me know. hahaha
i personally believe if you are involved with playing a satanic game and you see yourself as a christian  you are morally betraying the very thing you believe in  but im also not gonna be a karen and judge anyone for doing so. i just know i personally can t fuck with any game that has satanic anything in it. but some games are forcing that shit upon us.
i m pretty sure tolkien was a firm anti-fascist in the original sense  considering he openly dissed hitler and his racial ideals in a letter when hitler tried to gain tolkien s good graces to defect to germany.
it never ends what s next snoopy sylvester  tweety  bugs bunny  the woke mob has to change everything to fit their narrative.
know what else will make you right wing if you read it  the us constitution.
blood alters  methinks it should be blood altars.
if fear doesn t come from god  why is it called being a god-fearing christian
not really   lord of the rings  is heavily influenced by catholicism and george orwell  a democrat with socialist beliefs  wrote  1984  as a cautionary tale based on the totalitarism of the national socialist german workers  party and the communist party of the soviet union  meaning he criticizes leftists being a leftist himself .both of those books are against wokeists beliefs but it has nothing to do with right vs. left  wokeists are just coping hard. lol
this guy who wrote the article must have did some serious drugs probably still does.
how in the heii can reading lotr lead to right wing extremism  doesn t even make sense. as far as i know  there s no  right wing  politics even in it. the most there is  is a lesson in people from diverse backgrounds coming together for a common goal. there s nothing right wing about that. if anything  it s slightly left wing
let me get out the bottle of bleach and drink myself tile i m wasted.
further proof that right wing is the correct political views if those beliefs created the best trilogy of all time.
and i also want to add that the day they will change what is written in 1984 will be absolutely glorious  certainly the first book that transcript itself in real life.
the funny thing is they claim they hate hitler  but their actions suggest a low-key admiration for him
correlation does not equal causation. right wing are far more intelligent and therefore more likely to have read these books  not that reading these books made them right wing
well if that is what they think  so be it i do not care about their opinion.  let them ruin their names by this mess  let it blow up in their face.  their too afraid to do it in person  they just want to be keyboard warriors.  they are so afraid of the backlash of their actions and behavior  they do not want to do it in public.
interesting points  mel  the way i see it  the law has been nailed to the cross and christ has fulfilled the law. as we abide in christ  he fulfils the law in us. so there is no law against watching scary movies etc  but are they beneficial   i am a sucker for a good horror film though
radicalize readers   sounds like a step toward fahrenheit 451
what is with both politics extremes thinking popular media creates societal problems  my cousin loves the film   the birdcage  but hates my homo ass and our trans cousin. shouldn t  my this logic  a film about gay rights and drag performers cause him to not be homophobic and transphobic  man! it s almost like humanity doesn t exist in a bunch of little vacuums  and we re a social species with a multitude of influences over our individual values! who d a thunk it
i ve been moving leftwards for a while and i love both of these books  lord of the rings i ve been at least half a dozen times through since childhood and 1984 i haven t read for some time and hace  but i went through animal farm with my kids recently.so i m calling bullshit
year zero. it will continue until they are physically forced to stop.
the  oh no our kids  argument is mood - just make it pegi 18 or what have you in america.. i think m for mature is what you guys use easy. and just to be clear - i am a gamer through and through but i don t believe children teens should be able to have access to mature games.the real problem is rating agencies are incompetent and have no idea of the material they are rating. at best they have some idiotic social degree  with added lefty believes on top . games should be rated by gamers  not leftist social science majors. and stores  including steam  should enforce the rating - done. easy peasy.
i agree  little timmy s want to hide in their mom s basement and spit venom just to make them feel better rather than the truth that this planet can not come together until people come together for the greater fucking good.
positive masculinity and anti communism are kryptonite to the over communist  always.what should we read    das capital  mien kampf  a people s history   or critical theory    lmao
the fact that you say that in real life you are an 100  bible believer while in games you prefer to go on the dark side should make you wonder. where is christ in your escapism  or is that a realm where he can t reach  but if christ isn t present on this  realm   the world where you escape  who do you think is present  or you believe that you can go in worlds without god or the devil i know that this may sound harsh but escapism and stuffs like that should also reflect your christian life. you can t put christ in a box and after that to claim of loving him.also  satanic video games aren t real. but this doesn t mean that there isn t an demonic element which tries to attract you  an element which hides itself from your rationality by being only a game. let me give you an example. can you say that watching a rape played by some actors has nothing to do with a real rape  yes  it is not the same because this is acted. but don t tell me it doesn t affect you a little as it would affect you being witness to the real one.why do you thing we love movies and books and animes and stories so much  because we identify ourselves with the characters  because part of us live in that world. christ said that where is your heart  there is your treasure. can you really say that there is no part in your heart for this escapism  but christ says also that you can t serve 2 gods.christianity is very  very hard. and this is because it takes you away from all your escapism and passions  addictions  and forces you to became strong enough to not need escapism.melanie  do you know who your god really is  he is the one who got beaten  spit and mocked by a bunch of losers which he could have ended their existence in an instant. he is your model  what makes you think that he doesn t ask the same for you  no escapism but endure it all hopefully at one point you will understand that this escapism world is the secular religion of the xxith century.
this is just on a whole new level of crazy. i don t care if its on the far right or some shit if i like the old classics rather than the modern one. i still prefer the original lord of the rings rather than what woke hollywood is trying to push out.
as much as i disagree with jk rowling on a whole host of topics  i do very much appreciate her standing up and saying enough.  i wish she had not bowed to the woke mafia to retcon dumbledore into being gay. nothing just being gay  but if you read the first seven books it s pretty clear that he s not and wasn t.if j.r. tolkien were alive  he d be yelling  you do not pass  and telling them to stick it where the sun don t shine. you ve ever read about the man s life  he would not have been gentle.i want every person to be able to live their life the way they wish to be able to. as long as you re not hurting anybody else. and that s why i support equal rights for everybody.the lgbtq mafia however are now trying to violate my rights. enforcing speech  and providing cover for predators to enter women spaces  and groom children.that s not a problem i can solve  without going entirely draconian which i would rather not.  it s up to the alphabet mafia to identify those people and ruthlessly drum them out.because at this point  if there s a man in the women s bathroom  i m calling the police. and if the actual woman want that man out of the bathroom  i ll help remove him. i don t care if he s wearing a dress and lipstick  you re still a man.and molesters and groomers deserve nothing but death.and the ultimate child molesters and rumors are those who try to convince children to go through permanent surgical alteration to make them appear to be something they are not. those people are nothing more than sick medical experimentalists.  mengele level.and it s time for us as a society to put a hard stop to that. no so-called gender-affirming surgeries  which of course are exactly the opposite  for anyone under the age of majority.  no puberty blocking drugs for anyone under the age of adulthood unless there is a objectively identified pathology  such as precocious puberty which is a endocrine disorder.any doctor  parent  guardian  or other legally authorized person who permits or performs any such surgery  or prescribes or gives puberty blocking drugs  should face the loss of their license and prison  or prison as is appropriate for their role. the child should be removed from their custody.
that s full mask off!!
personal convictions aside  if you wanna play a game where you sacrifice friends to the devil then just do it.if you feel bad about it  then just play i am jesus christ afterwards.    _                      _
good thing i read them twice then
authors  radicalize readers   i would hope so.
according to the woke orcs and goblins are real.
this ----justin lol. that s my name and today s my birthday. love your content mel you always make me smile. priceless lady you are.
girl  don t you know there are browser extensions to have a global night mode  i want to watch your videos  but i always get half blind with your ultra white screens. you can even see how your face totally lights up when you open those tabs  lol.
anorexia is a dysmorphic disorder that leads to people killing themselves.   this is why we try to help people with anorexia overcome the delusions  can t link source  thanks youtube for suppressing actual science .  mesh terms are anorexia nervosa delusion pubmed  which are at the root of their disease.  whether they are overvalued ideals  i want to be thin  or strict delusions  i m fat .what we don t do is feed into those delusions by encouraging them to go even further.  recommending so-called transgender surgery to a patient who believes they are a different gender  is like recommending liposuction  eating less  weight loss  and appetite-suppressing drugs to an anorexic with less than 4  body fat.it is exactly the opposite of what that patient needs.in my view  transgender people fall into three camps. the first is the healthy variety.  the least common.  these are people who realize that they are what they are  and they choose to live as another gender and are willing to accept the inconvenience  pain  potentially shortened life due to hormones  and public scrutiny.  i have two friends like this. i was at their respective weddings. but neither of them has any delusions about what they are.  in a conversation with the ftm  she told me that she understands she is very probably shortening her life by 10 to 20 years because of the combination of testosterone and estrogen blockers. she was mentally stable  and happy before her transition. and she is mentally stable and happy now. that is a nondelusional person who recognizes that they are posing as another gender and that s how they want to live their life. and i support that in those cases.the second variety is the delusional. the people who believe they actually have changed from female to male or male to female. that is delusion in the face of reality. and that should not be celebrated or encouraged  and no surgery or hormone therapy should be given in that case. those people should be treated for their mental illness. the same way that you treat someone suffering from anorexia nervosa.the third group are transtrenders. these are people who are rolling with the trend. many of them may overlap with the delusional category  but that s a case-by-case.  many of these people are very young  under the influence of public trends.  your typical young person who s going through a crisis of identity. which is something that every young person goes through as they grow from a child into an adult. the problem is now you ve got this entire industry targeting these people telling them that their normal adolescent angst is actually gender dysmorphia and then push and encourage them to follow this path of transgenderism. frankly that is evil. it isn t like becoming emo or goth  which are entirely reversible conditions.  this leads to permanent physiological and psychological damage.currently  the left is engaging in an all fronts war to influence the second and third type to grab onto transgenderism as their flag. and then fly that flag and hate anyone who attempts to actually help them.  this is an extension of the prior push  which was more subtle  where they push adolescents into adopting lgb lifestyles  and then set up the straw man that conservatives are their enemy because they re gay.  but conservative person doesn t care how you live your life as long as you re not hurting others. the line gets drawn when you start pushing particular lifestyles on children or the mentally ill who can t reasonably make decisions.for the second and third type  the delusional and transtrenders  psychological and or psychiatric should be the approach. not encouraging them to delve ever deeper into delusion.first  face what you really are. get healthy in that space.  then  as a consenting adult who is not delusional  if you wish to pretend to be another gender  then that s your choice as an adult.i draw another line at being forced to call someone a woman  who is not. i will be polite  as long as you are. but i will not pull punches on the facts of the case. and if you decide to try to insist that i call you a woman  when you are not. i will refuse. in the history of humankind no man has ever become a woman.  that s reality.
great  very thoughtful argument
they sometimes refer to a caucasian person as a  c-m goblin  among several other slurs they claim aren t racist...
happy birthday!
@melonie mac go boom  i wish you played apex
so about all this controversy surrounding peter pan an wendy!!!!
video games are real!! i run around and stomp mushrooms and punt the ever living shit out of turtles every time i can.
biggitarmy
hello melonie  first i agree 100  i have another question. in one of your videos i got a comment  that i should text you on telegram for my reward. is this real or scam
@melonie mac go boom    @7 44 its almost like those people came from an animal farm the way they act.my mom is a huge into  birding  she has a channel with over 4k followers.  the left has been getting into every bird watching group  they found my mom and tried to make her  admit  that most raptors in the wild are gay  which is far from the truth.   they didn t like she didn t bend the knee  so they attacked her channel  got some of her birding videos struck down.
damn  even nerds are terrorists now
they say that like it s a bad thing.
so the answer to the jq is lord of the rings
ofcourse every real tolkien stories but not the fake tolkien r.o.p
scratches head  i don t feel very right...wing.
thanks for the update. i guess i m a fascist now. i neverbknew i was lol but i gladly will be if it means loving the books and movies i m no fascist obviousness
doom probably the most christian game lol
i m gonna gatekeep the heck out of the lord of the rings. if you don t love the works  if you don t love tolkien and what he wrote and how he wrote it  get the hell out of middle earth.
but some folks believe wakonda is a real place and that s just fine
1984 especially
between bigotry and degeneracy  the choice is simple.
remember they already said a traditional 2parent family and being on time to work are considered white supremacy.
i wouldn t worry about it too much.a quick look around tells me kids aren t learning how to read anymore  anyhow.
left wing has confused itself so much that they don t realize that they ve become right wing  lol.
...takes one to know one...
@photriuspyrelus   i hope it s just youtube.   i also sent melonie a 10 dollar super thanks  but its deleted  its very cheap if youtube is doing that while i m still paying for the comment.
wokies... sounds like wookies   lol
awesome .another religious video
you know  a liar thinks everyone is a liar. put 2 and 2 together lol
have a good weekend
yup. they hate art  comedy  literature  independent thinkers  free speech  common sense  evidence  discussion  nature  truth and god.  evil destroys  good creates .
j.r.r. tolkien  c.s. lewis  and george orwell s writings all have one thing in common. they write stories about being vigilant against and fighting evil.i don t think it s a coincidence these are the people the left is coming after.if you ever have any questions about people s moral character  just listen to what they say about and watch what they do to those who push for morality and decency. just ask yourself  why would good and decent people want to destroy something that depicts good triumphing over evil  the answer is  if they were truly good  they wouldn t.
tolken and 198 r epic books and the world is basicly allready 1948 now
my god  since ps1 or snes we have games that makes blood or souls sacrifice to acquire powers  they are a bit late!
insane
didn t orwell call himself socialist
don t you know it s  the current year
you know mel what you just described sounds like a virus or a cancer.
...classic entertainment...traditional entertainment...
no longer hidden when was these things actually hidden  because i have alot of titles from the 80s 90s and early 2000s which grasps just this theme.examples for more popular ones skyrim oblivion morrowind  yeap nothing new.
i am pro- gatekeeper
affliction   with nick nolte.scariest movie i ve ever seen.
cover up your shoulder how dare you lol
any reading i would have thought.
1984 isn t about  right  or  left .  it s about authoritarianism versus liberty.
with them using the word bigot  phobe  and anything with a ist so much  those words kind of lost their meaning. like what you like and game on
thanks!
so  i have been a right-wing extremist since i was about ten years old then  seems a bit strange to me  because i don t even remember having any political opinions one way or the other back then.people on the internet said it though  so it has to be true  considering it s  23 and all you need to do is state something and it becomes so  regardless of how insane it might sound.bad ten year old me  bad!
people are delusional
the wokies always find new ways to try to stop our beloved classics...
this is why i m just playing fort bruh
anything that goes against elite opinion could be bigotry  apparently.
thanks again for pointing out the hypocrisy
truly ground breaking.  i dont know where i would be with out the youtube gossip tabloid.  i wouldnt of known this after all that has gone on.  after all these years of yall doing nothing but complaining and  fighting the good fight  this where we are after all that.  imgaine if yall made something instead of just sitting in circles repeating the same old things for some views xd
tennyson and the stories of camelot as well as king arthur   the knights of the round table to be added to the british terrorist watch list of things to read next
the lord of the rings books are bad  because they contradict the rings of power  - idiots
lol i m never surprised by what the woke mobs carnival themed ideology has to offer lol
100
call me bigot baggins.
only leads to bigotry against orcs and trolls... which some of these activists kind of look like now that i think about it.... for frodo!
imagine  10-15 years ago if you liked lotr  at most you were just a nerd loll. stay beautiful mel.
if they feel that way don t watch it.  these people needs to tell others people how to live. they can watch she hulk then
of course it does
i m just gunna start wearing the bigot label proudly. might even get badges made.
ima biggit again well wot else is new
uk moment
the woke people are reading that marxist books 6 33
if it wasn t for these vids  i wouldn t have an idea that people think like this. moreso  they re willing to write articles like this. ridiculous.
i have been listening to nonsense about  banning books   trans-porn books   now this !
rebranding to  lord of the gays
this is a bigger joke than the minnesota vikings in the nfl playoffs
it s just sensitive writers who want to shiz on anything that threatens their narrative.
the woke mob is apparently getting mad and hating the new final fantasy game.
well that explains  vargvikernes     jk
i m only about 7 minutes in  but what the hell is that article  like  to a certain extent i understand what s being said  but my brain is telling me that i can t being hearing things right cause that sounds like utter nonsense. such massive words and claims being used for something so harmless is making my head spin.
i can t with them. the left is a disaster  they want to ruin evertthing. but if they dare touch lord of the rings  hands will be thrown  it is my favorite series ever  that s why i haven t seen rings of power because i don t want to ruin lotr.
well that s just silly.
the world gets dumber daily...
j s always do this.
yeah  scare the sheep away from 1984 so they don t realize what s happening. that makes sense at least.

1984 doesn t make you bigotedit makes you aware  what your government is doing
hate to say it but melonie has turned into a gym girl tiktoker just waiting to play victim. that old guy was socially awkward but she films herself in attractive outfits then goes to events and tells her fans come see her this guy clearly wanted more but all she had to do was tell him not interested move on.
this is so funny but it really not. i don t how to feel.. well  i do... god bless you.
i don t care what people think of me.  this world is messed up. i like lord of the rings books lord of the rings the movies harry potter the movies and harry potter and hogwarts  games
imho the main question which the young ones  teenagers  and those about 20  shoud be asking themselves before they chose to enter any kind of political party or political ideology or  social movement    which is also most probably only a part of the same game - we can think of  parties  and  movements  like this - the system is playing with itself using us all as npcs  d   is about borders  two borders actualy. you  young ones should ask yourself about two borders. - first you should ask where science ends and political ideology begins. - then you should ask where  valid  political ideology ends and lunacy begins. these two questions allow you to define borders. without knowing those 2 borders citizens cannot be sure what politics and global medias could have indoctrinated into their minds. becouse every few years the cathegories  of political and legal systems  and their definitions can change due to what they want you to think. to enslave your thinking. thats why they hate so much all fantasy genre  all this escapism art. becouse escapism tells of freedom ! freedom of mind. these control-freaks want to control our minds. without cathegories and defined borders of cathegories you cannot think for yourself   like for example -  this is liberal thing  and  this is totalitarian thing  btw the real opposite is between liberal and totalitarian not between liberal and conservative becouse liberalism tells of our approach to individual person and to freedom and conversatism tells of our approach to time  to past and future  without define borders of cathegories  and without cathegories of ideas our minds work as molded clay in the hands of  social engineers  and pr and  psy-ops  of deep states. they want your mind to be enslaved by hired indoctrinators from the global medias.  and these two borders allow you to know what are those things you would like to start require from politics. its up to you where you like build this border between science and politics and between politics and lunacy. but remember one thing - the more strictly you define the two borders there is more chance for your personal freedom from scientists sellouts to politicians and from politicians sellouts to lunatics. the less strictly you define these two borders the more hacks of those 3 groups can influence your brain - and so the lesser is your area of freedom of thinking. becouse only through the freedom of mind you can define your external area of freedom and to know what are those things you require from your politicians. so the less free is your mind the smaller is the area of your external freedom on rl.  but to be able to know what we want and what we dont want from politics  and to be able to not be indoctrinated by their mass psychosis and tools of minds control  you need much thinking about establishing the two borders. and also these two borders you must define for yourself are such kind of borders which can help you define your freedom. it seems paradoxical that we must define our borders first before we can see our area of freedom. the more freedom you got as individual - the less politics you need  and the more politics there is around - the more power politics got over you  over your mind  and the less freedom you got. the eternal struggle is between freedom and power. liberalism should have been about lessening the areas of power to make areas of freedom greater. but imo liberalism does not work that way in our times. now its sellout to totalitarian regimes. imo borders not only divide and separate - as they probably have been telling you for years - but also give freedom  fredom from others. its like a house with many rooms  every individual kid gets his own room in the house of their parents. think about nations as those kids and wider culture  for example western one  as their parents. kids have obligations toward parents and parents have obligations toward kids. and kid have obligations to other kid.  rights  is something which can only be functioning with  obligations .  rights  and  obligations  are two sides of one coin. there is no  rights  without  obligations  and there should be no  obligations  without  rights . every kind of politics  of whatever side of the spectrum  which tells you that you should have any  rights  without naming also your  obligations  connected to thes  rights  is false politics  and probably this kind of indoctrination means that its the politicians and their elite sponsors who want you to think that they  politicians and their sponsors also should have only  right  without  obligations  over you  which bring us on the verge of totalitarian regime.
now i m wondering what s your take on the church of england s new gender neutral god.
it s iconoclasm
you re damn right it does.
1984!  seriously!  when i 1st read 1984  and liked it  i was labeled as being a liberal hippie
if they say reading one of the best fictional literary story ever written makes me a bigot  then fckng call me mr.biggot.

they do understand thay by calling everything bigotry and transphobic and mysogenistic these words actually lose power  right  it become meaningless...
i guess mean being men not wearing women clothes saying darling and bent wrists is that what they mean
soooo  does this mean that anyone who reads say  tumblr fan fiction  or is a watcher of  cp   should be considered a  far-left extremist   sorry  i know...that was a very  v e r y stupid question lol.

what do left wingers read  ... a cook-book
this man is rolling in his grave.
diablo! been sacrificing people in video games since 1999! wokeness needs to go away. their ideology reminds me of  an older ideology led by a man with a short mustache. think his name rhymed with kitler
because a tale of multiple races and characters of all different creeds and ideologies coming together to fight a common enemy is right wing lol
i m 100  bigotry
the powers that be are following the mao cultural revolution with softer tactics.
has t6he world lost all reason
frankly they reached peak clown world when they claimed that reading 1984 leads to authoritarian rightwing sentiments... xdp.s. stop hitting on the survivor trilogy  d

shorten the damn facecam.
fahrenheit 451  anyone
what  mindset    - do u mean believe in freedom of individual  free speech  free will   - do you mean respect for a culture s masterpieces and esp for one s native culture   in my case its respect for european culture - for 30 centuries of its sedimentations. and of course for my national culture. i try to learn about european culture  to delve into with all respect but also criticaly. i pity them - those who are so much into egoism or narcisism to not be able to care for past and so care for future  you cannot care for future without caring for past   they care only for themselves  their own images in global medias. they dont know what they lose. what are their interests besides money or politics  or become famous  - do you mean detest of any kind of tyrrany    live and let live  ideal   - do you meant treating any person as an individual person  not as part of their nation religion ideology gender race  becouse only that way we can treat different person without biases or veil of political ideology toward any kind of group. - do you mean that believe that dignity is humans right even for our enemies but respect of person for a person should be earned   - do you mean the believe that family  parents   children  is a value and should not be seen as political enemy or as oppression or as bad thing  - do you mean the believe in freedom of religion which means that every religion is allowed as long as its not hurting freedom of other religions or other nations or personal freedom for example taking some ppl as hostages   - do you mean that believe in personal freedom means also the believe in personal responsibility - so your crime belongs to you  its yours  not your family  not your ancestors  not your religion not your nation - even if you did this for the sake of your religion or country. they are not respensible for your deeds. and you are not responsible for the deeds of your leaders  political or religious . yes  that actualy european invention bc of this individual freedom. that only criminal is responsible for a crime  not his group. - do you mean seeing seek of truth as humans natural ability but also as humans cultural obligation   becouse  veritas ante omnia  - truth is above all. whatever is your ideology  religion  job  money  career  comfort  even personal freedom and health - seek of truth is above all of it.- do you mean believe that seek of truth is most important humans goal becouse it allows us progress  development. development above our personal interests and small ambitions and comforts. but it also allows us seek of justice. there is no chance of justice without knowing what is true  to be able to do justice we must know the truth before. thats how a legal system should be functioning.  if you mean sort of those belives as being extremist - ok  i m extremist      evil  toxic tolkien fan and proud of it   - thats what i printed on my t-shirt. popculture fights still ! - tolkien fandom stands alone. - not alone. fandoms ! - to the king !
lol
i am right wing anyway so whatever lol
i dunno. i watched return of the king last night and punched a black lady on the train this morning. they might be right.
do ya play no man s sky
kindve hard to take this serious given that 1984 is now the playbook for the left......
boom
i m pakistani and a muslim.  proud to be a right wing extremist!
so lord of the rings leads to right wing extremism... and mein kampf was a satire. brilliant.
tolkien is based. read more tolkien.
i love  you. marry me .
why are you wearing the sweater like that just to show off the tattoos bruh lol
0 00 to 1 40 do you ever stop with that praddle woman  like we get it you liked everything when it was old and grand and nothing was like what you didnt like
clearly  i must ve read those books wrong. very wrong. so wrong  in fact  that i turned into a libertarian socialist.the real fun won t start until they point out the correlation between reading the quran and joining al qaeda  though. unless i m much mistaken  100  of al qaeda members have read that book.
right wing af now i guess
bigotry comes from the right. not lord of the rings. lol
i m a bigot  so what. do your worst.
imagine not being a right wing extremist  lmao cringe
remember plebeians  reading and thinking for yourself and not accepting what the elite rulers want you to think is right wing!
do you want to go out with me
lord of the rings is great white ary ethnocentric culture.
yeah  it could lead to it  or not. besides  what s the issue with it  go read something else!
you say racial purity like it s a bad thing.
i guess everyone that watched the rings of power are right wing bigots
you say sexism has no meaning anymore yeah but women can still throw you in jail for a false accusation
let s go man am hispanic and i read the book via audio form a few years back you can call me a bigot all day long and i might call you racist .
i think you missed the point of what i was saying . i said people have overused the word itself  thus making it mean nothing most of the time it is used. i never implied sexism doesn t exist.
@melonie mac go boom  oh no i didn t accuse you of saying sexism doesn t exist. i was simply mentioning its still often used but by grifters which honestly increases sexism its honestly sad for all of us who just want to get along with others. but thank you for the clarification
hurray  i m a right wing bigot
just like blazing saddles couldn t be made today with its satire  the original lotr trilogy couldn t be made today.  too white.  too straight.  too moral.
woops !!! then im a right wing extremist 4 times over...mwauhahahahahahahahahaha!!!
no it doesn t. it just makes critics seem like authoritarian filth.
if reading the for the rings books makes you a right-wing bigot i guess i wonder what they would call a person that reads the bible  this will go down the same way you went down with hogwarts legacy.

my god!  this rant was so racist!!
guess what the 90 s style christian conservative puritans were bad  the left wing progressive puritans are also bad. two things can be bad.
fascism is alive and well
your taking an idea fro. one random person who wrote an article. and blowing it up like it s an actual movement. it s a small group of people who think think. stop making it worse out than it is. everyone can have there opinion.
start of the two towers is so boring.
but it s on the left side of the aisle.
