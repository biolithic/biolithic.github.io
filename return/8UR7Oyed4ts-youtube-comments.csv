matthew 18 15-17 is a good call. so often we spend time calling people out without either first addressing our own faults or thinking about the potential impact on themselves and others around them. gossip is like a forest fire - let it spread too far  and it could be seriously damaging. discipline is also important though  for the health of the church.great exposition on those verses  melonie!
