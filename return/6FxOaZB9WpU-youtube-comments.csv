honestly you have the best channel Ive ever heard. I love that you also incorporate some of your faith into your talks and read off Bible verses because sometimes I think people get scared of sharing that with other people. also I love gaming. I dont get to do it as often now that I have kids but every once in a while me and my husband will sit down and play diablo or cod or something like that and have an absolute blast.
