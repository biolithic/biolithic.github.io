congrats on becoming an aunt! also I do need a prayer from you and the chat melanie as I am struggling with mental health.

just heard that the baby boy arrived. if its ok with you Im going to pray for him right now. Lord I pray for melonie mac new little nephew. Jesus I pray that you watch over him  that you guide him and he will see your glory and grace through out his life. Lord Jesus I pray that you bless him and his family. in your name I pray Jesus amen.

hey melonie  I wanna let you know that I recently prayed for the first time in ages. and I think you   your channel was influential to that.

Im slowly trying to find ways to keep myself mentally stable and your videos have been helping especially the Bible quote portion of the video. keep on making great content and go boom!

congratulations auntie melonie!  you will be a great aunt.  I love your content and you are helping me make better choices and getting healthier.  thank you.
