there are various components to the design aesthetic that I believe are very successful in both the 2d concept art and the 3d render. not everything translates from 2d to 3d everytime..that could be due to the artist s  skill levels and improvisations. I believe any combat role is inherently masculine. to be a tank  which she is  she needs to no only look strong  muscles designed for the fray and pushing the enemies  but be tall in stature. tanks lead  you and I are not going to follow and be protected by someone tiny  delicate and feminine. this is where her design succeeds very well  she s a tank  a surprisingly sexy one at that  overywatch didn t shy away from her curves  which highlight her fit feminine frame. women rule in sex and Im glad the designers didn t run from it. while her eyes didn t translate over to 3d well  I dont think anyone in the games eyes look very good  not even widowmaker  or sojurn her eyes are pretty cool tho . this may be an over design choice or be limited by skill. as far as the junk punk look goes  I think more remains to be seen..they are probably saving a better design as a premium mirco transaction now that its free to play...but her general design language its tight  mad maxy junk and punk paint. which is a cool vibe  solid 8 10.
wow I didn t think this video was going to be great but man  it completely changed my view of the junker queen. absolutely crazy how perfect this video was. thank you.
I agree wholeheartedly  I dont like thatsome of the community focuses sexuality instead of gameplay. I didn t even realize how much that affects character design as well but it makes sense now because I was so confused looking at her backstory about whether she was a dps or tank character. I dont want to guess I want to know just based on how character looks that they should be a certain role.
as someone who s wanted junker queen to be a character in the game for years  Im completely happy with her design tbh  and she looks like a fun character to play
hopefully those ingame shots are still early and they will really make her pop!
this breakdown video with the commentary overlaid is very nice  has very professional official feels to it  like Im watching old school g4 or inside gaming
appreciate the analysis  but I was so taken by the cinematic  I just loved it all.
junker queen is everything!!! blizzard  you guys are becoming out of touch...
you talk a lot about how you care more about what she brings to the game in terms of gameplay but not once go over her abilities and what it could do to effect the game.
I love this review! Im getting gamestop vibes without gamestop. you knocked this out of the park! looking forward to more of these! cheers
wow this new video format really worked  this is cool !!! I hope you make vids like this more often  you go girl !!!
I would like to see more game reviews!
and yet here she is as the top pick rate tank in the pros as the premier brawling tank. blizzard did a great job on her gameplay design.
dont really comment that often but  really miss the verse of the day on this vid. has been like a second devotion when listening to it. on the other hand  the content on this channel has been fun  thoughtful and engaging so gotta give my props
amazing review style  very well put.
im liking these long scripted commentary formats
wow  this narration presentation reminded me of the old x-play days! I really liked it!!
great job sharing your thoughts melonie!  I enjoyed this new video format and in which youreview a video game computer game character  in this case bunker queen from overwatch!! I too wish that game studios like blizzard and others would focus more on creating unique characters that have unique play ability styles versus focusing on their orientation. dont get me wrong I love a good story with good character development and interaction. but you cannot overlook gameplay and characters unique style and playability. a favorite game of mine fromthe past was twisted metal black. lots of characters with interesting backstories and motivations but I was more concerned with how each had their own play style and weapons set.
liking this different format  but that doesnt mean to stop what you were already doing!
mel mac!!!! not that I dont love seeing your face in your videos  but this format  the editing  the flow  the commentary  even the length  I watched this as I was doing dishes  are all... ...  insert pacha hills sing meme here ... 12 10 for this video  and I hope you make more like these on occasion!!!
d.va s been a tank for years where she can pop out of her big mech and do nothing but shoot and is literally smaller in size than mercy  yet no one criticizes her design lol
@hunter  thats because hana isn t the tank  its her mech. she s piloting itsure  but without it  she s just a tiny dps character.
honestly if I wanna play an actual good junk queen at this point I ll just play mad maggie in apex legends. because at least thats a weeellllll written character that I like.
hilarious
she s more focused on her sexuality and her punker hairstyle. xd
not like she s a great tank anyway. she doesnt do much except for her bleeding effect and even that is easily countered by better tanks like reinhardt  orisa and wrecking ball.
they haven t even said anything about junker queen sexual orientation though. its just fans asking.
well  this is new!I thought that it is some report from a game site  but no - we re going boom!nicely put on piece!
great and honest observation!
I love your review of junker queen. big agree with everything you said. I wish they had went with her original design. I also wish they would stop forcing diversity politics in overwatch. I dont know why they need to make a sequel to overwatch when they could just keep updating the original. I d love to see more reviews of characters in the future. I like this alternative video format and it will be a good mix with your regular format.
I feel the character design from both the concept and cinematic were pretty close to having that fine balance of femininity and masculinity. where she looks like she could crush your skull  but she would seduced you into letting her with her womanly charms. it was shown how smart she is over how strong she was  even though she s labeled as a tank  I feel she should ve been a fighter class that isn t too fast  or too strong but her use of her magnet bracelet and her weapons combined  along with the environment would make her a very mobile and sturdy player. not too mention how she values team work as well  so she would be the one who controls the battlefield by using her ally s. the voice they picked was very cute with an cheeky attitude which I love and fits that fun attribute to junker queen. unfortunately  the character design in-game  felt like a complete botched. her gameplay didn t seem fun or engaging  and her design was  as you put it  bland and not really appealing. I wouldn t say too busy  I think the opposite  so I agree that this design felt  safe  but still try to lean more to masculinity which kills the character for me. Im not sure if it was politics  or fans  or lack of imagination  but the design and character in the gameplay felt so underwhelming  and hard to take seriously. she looks like a mini-boss fight if anything  and not a character I d enjoy to play and have that earned epic win. the original game design was fairly good  very feminine  but I couldn t believe she would be a desert punk queen  let alone a tank or a fighter character. so I guess junker queen just needs a bit more tweaking in both gameplay and design. dont be afraid to have her be feminine but still be powerhouse that ll bring a surprise win. I still would rather the game series have stand-alone like arcane  or story mode so we cantruly enjoy these characters. it feels like an injustice for these awesome characters and locations  so much lore to experience. I want to know and experience junker queen s past  and her goals. what does she plan and how is she going to go about it  anything else is just fun little details but nothing important. I feel her only love interest would be her mission  and her lovers would be her guitar and axe. nothing else would be that important to her or her story.
omg love the commentary! at first I thought it was a clip you included from a video game site or something
great commentary melonie. loved your insight and agree that we dont need a backstory on these characters.
its so weird how little you acknowledge that maybe its just not your taste. so many people love this character design
she s not attention getting but she still gets snu snu!!
this video style felt like you in your element. a refreshing change.
the original punk girl was very refreshing and I personally always liked punk girls. seeing her design in that hamond spray made me very excited for the character herself  but seeing what they did kinda proves that blizzard dont care much for their own ip anymore. such a radical change to an already established design is concerning. now the only thing thta would bring me back to this dead game is zenyatta.
honestly I just dont care about what they do anymore. to be fair I do hop on overwatch occasionally when my sister from another mister is streaming  she s a mercy main and I am usually orisa when I play  and most of the time I just play the game and the last thing I think about is who is dating who.if I am playing on my own  story of my life  I usually choose on what is going to help the team than how much damage I do to the other team.
to be fair we maybe saw maybe 5 seconds of gameplay of her.  so let s hold our criticism till after june 16th  if we get gameplay  or the 28th.
the vast majority of the community likes the design and character even the abilities. idk what you were expecting especially since she kind of was shown in wreckingball sprays etc
re  how does she play from the look of her  or more precisely her weapons  I d say she s a close in shottie melee character so she d be a bit tankie... unfortunately  since they started pandering to the weirdos I dont think there s any going back for blizzard  not least because they aren t willing to weather the criticism from the media loons re  being problematic.
fantastic review
cant wait to  play trans jinx!!
fantastic analysis!
Im shocked  shocked!!!!!
the game better be good. dont need the rest.
hImelonie I hope your weekend was nice relaxing for you  anotherreally video takecare melonie
overwatch 2 was originally supposed to focus on the pve side of things with pvp being in the background but then blizzard used it as a sort of refresh. which I kinda hate since I think they should have focused more on the story side of things but Im still happy for anything new when it comes to overwatch
lol what  most of the people that play overwatch want a backstory. lore is huge in overwatch and they are going to make it part of the pve side of the game. which I think is awesome
its so weird how little you acknowledge maybe thats just your taste. so many people despise this character design. see  both can play that game chucklenuts.
@bolg  bro you literally said chucklenuts your opinion is invalid
blizzard has a long way to go if they want people to like them again.
tanks reworked means new tanks dont have to be freaking trains like the previous ones. this is why you are confused. they created junker queen with 5v5 in mind.
fans are not underwhelmed I haven t met a single unsatisfied fan
she looks like the next supporting character on kevin smith s  he-ma am  cartoon.
honestly forgot this game existed.
consume product  do not question  consume product.
wasn t able to put on word what looks so odd to me but pretty much is what you said! plus her face  voice and expressions looks a lot like ash in the body of zaria. I dont see her personality at all just by the trailer
there s this concept in character design of appeal -- not necessarily sex appeal. just a sense of  does the character have an interesting  unique look thatsets them apart  communicates their personality  and is in general fun to look at  tracer is an example of a character with a lot of appeal. the profile of her body suggests her abilities  plus she s super cute and one look at her face with those expressive eyes will show thatshe is full of energy and optimism.its clear that for junker queen  they went with a design that had a lot of appeal -- and then they toned it down. sjws dislike appeal and love indistinct blobs  because a character s appeal communicates something specific about the character  and to the sjw specificity that detracts from their representation of a marginalized group. appealing characters also tend to have very strong masculine or feminine traits -- they communicate masculinity or femininity in very clear ways.  even zarya has clear feminine tells  like the smoothness of her face and her delicately manicured nails.  but of course  that just reinforces the gender binary  and thats bad -- so new characters have to be more androgynous.  and not awesome  moira androgynous -- boring  blobby androgynous.  plus  fun characters create the risk that the wrong kinds of people will be attracted to and enjoy the game media franchise  making it into something less than a safe space  and we cant have that. so actiblizzard soft  is now in the position of trying to balance what made overwatch so unique and special when it first came out  building its fan base  with hewing to the needs of its esg overLords who abhor fun without official sanction.
honestly  for a junkertown resident.. she looks.. too.. clean Imean look at junkrat  roadhog. hell  look at the enemies in the new cinematic trailer  they all look dirty and at least has worn out clothes  she looks  too clean  for me.
great points in your video!
haven t played overwatch in years  and I suspect that wont change anytime soon. your review reminded me of the diversity tool people were talking about recently that activision blizzard developed  though. it does feel like blizzard  and others  spend too much time focusing on things that have nothing to do with the actual gameplay  which hurts their games.
great video melonie. its very apparent that you put time and thought into this video. I always look forward to your videos. you keep us informed and entertained.
I think we ll have to wait for the actual gameplay before we judge
they should ve committed to giving her a larger metal arm on her left side  kinda like doom fist  and keep her grimey and shit
I think she s perfect. I love her. I think she ll be so fun
I watched the whole video  I agree with some points and disagree with other.but I cant stop thinking what everyone s favorite food would be!
hey! when Im playing a game that depends on tactic and abilities. my first question is always  what is the sexuality   of any character I play.
just give her an exo-suit and keep same features as she did in the leaks. rather than making another zarya
love this format and your big brain  but I also miss your face and gym bod     .
exactly! another great video.
does anybody know when melonie is going 2b live on twitch
yep definitely  also take in the fact that  if I remember correctly  her empowered attacks apply grievous wounds on enemies which in turn heals her. so she s basically a bruiser with a crap ton of healing
@dragon sentai  jumps on floor junker queen  hello thereturns head junkrat  general grievoustakes axe junker queen  kapitan bomba  we meet again
nah  she s better than teela. I dont hate her. I hate new teela.
good point
that was proven to be false
the overwatch team never used that  youre just tricking yourself because you don want to commit to the game again in the first place
@igor corr a  or I just didn t enjoy the game enough to play it much. not everyone enjoys the same style of game.
@joseph crabtree  Imean  you made itseem like the diversity tool makes you not want to comeback as they are focused on that instead of gameplay or whatever  when its literally the oposite
@igor corr a  if a game releases something new or focuses on new playstyles  it can get me to play again for a while  even if I lost interest previously. nothing in the information available about junker queen made piqued my interest. as far as the diversity tool goes  its mere existence makes me inclined to wait to buy any new blizz game at this point just to know how the actual gameplay is.
and enraged
you dont though  not to judge the visual design of the character  which is what this video is about
@slick ric  you do though  we havent seen her design in full action  and if it fits her personality
I support the alternative video format  this was unexpected. however  while the script was done well overall  it felt very unnatural in terms of the delivery aside from a few talking points.  like it was immediately apparent it was a read. a little work on that and I think these ll take off if they re interspersed between the normal uploads.
with the way you describe and from what Im looking at  itseems like they tried to please way too many people all at once. and you know what happens when thats attempted. something like this. boring. run of the mill. the kind of character thats definitely a character of some sort and totally exists I guess. what they tried to fight for so desperately was inevitably denied as a result.
nailed it
its been 4 years since Ive last played overwatch. I ll hop back on when they finally balance the heroes.
to me she looks like a raider from fallout I think you are right she needed either more femininity or something to make her stand out instead of looking like another whacky character
this feels like itshould have been uploaded to your original channel lol but its a great format for you  hearing you calmly express your opinions is a nice change of pace  as great as your reactions and rants are. also missed the Bible verse of the day! appreciate you mixing it up thoughand yeah this character looks boring and butchy compared to the original concept art. the design wouldn t be a big deal if they hadn t shown one certain type of design first and then switched out  during a time when companies seem to be doing this often just to pull the rug out from under fans for the sake of pandering to certain people
its kind of disappointing that the person to rise above the animals of junkertown is just another crazy asshole. I know the lore states the title is won by trial by combat  but it would have been cool to see someone vicious yet more cunning than the rest of the inhabitants of junkertown. junker queen just kind of ends up landing in some bland grey zone  not as maniacal and screw-loose as junkrat  and not menacing as roadhog. there s meant to be a number of new heroes coming. Im hoping the new female japanese character is gonna be as cool as the super shimada bros.
so she s like your ability and content .
the best ign review that is not an ign review. great stuff  melonie!
I like this video format ngl
awesome video! I cant agree enough! she looked like a check boxed character as soon as I saw her. it wouldn t surprise me if she was op when the game releases to gain attention. I love this format. it works really well  and shows off how great of a presenter you are. amazing job!
loved this review of bunker queen. I wont be playing overwatch 2  but this style of commentary from you was excellent. I cant wait for future reviews of other characters or games in the future.
ea w their opinion I guess . I really like her
honestly  I think she matches the early art just fine. I still find her design a little uninteresting  but maybe she ll get some interesting skins  or her personality will come through ingame  and she ll be fun to play. that ll be the important part. most characters have kind of not super interesting designs on their base skins anyway  to the point where I cant point out any Im not already super biased about  that I think stand out as amazing to me.I do wish they d kept the scar from the art though.
there s not much yellow going on for someone who s a junker
I think she looks badasssssss and cool af and I love her vibe   gameplay
reminds me of those factoid cards you could drum up about anime manga characters for their commercial breaks bonus pages. mha s have been most memorable of late.its nice as an extra insight  and sometimes it even becomes plot relevant out of the blue  like everyone s blood type being listed when an antagonist with a blood-centric ability shows up   but itshould rarely  if ever  be central to the narrative. its a seasoning for the characters  not the core ingredient of the story.
she reminds me of bridget nielsen
hmmm I wonder if junker queen will be given  they  as a pronoun  just like the new character in rainbow six siege   sens.
do you know of oxhorn   this reminds me of his style.  I watch his stuff sometimes.
thank you for the feedback!
@melonie mac go boom  no problem. to elaborate on what Imeant  the script was written very well  honestly I wouldn t change anything there  but only some of the points that were being made where you got a bit fired up about them sounded natural. bring the same energy from the normal uploads over to these and I think it ll work out.I forgot to mention the editing  that was some fine work. no complaints with that.
what are you even talking about
the game is way more balanced then it was 2 years after launch dude
@elias bremer   press x for doubt
tell me youre a low rank player without telling me youre a low rank player
@shaqinthebox  diamond on console and pc  scrub. I got tired of the rebalancing of heroes because the devs kept listening to the wrong people in the community that kept screaming about characters being too strong etc. along with people demanding a constant 2 2 2 team because they believe in tier lists and listening to pro players is the only way to win. thats some of the reasons why I stop playing this game and went back to fighting games.
what are your thoughts on her character after the cinematic
@mostly moony  what Im wondering. she s comes off as caring and cunning. completely different than  another crazy asshole.
@mostly moony  its interesting thatshe gains her title of junker queen by being actually pretty noble in comparison to the the last ruler  but I find it a little hard to believe how someone like that has survived long enough. I d guess in most cases its more beneficial for you to be treacherous than noble in junkertown  but its a cool subversion. the music was great but that narration from odessa just talking straight to the viewer was a bit of a lazy storytelling option. plus  thatsheet of metal hurtling towards her thatshe saved the other guy from didn t seem to be that dangerous for her.
she s a fucking punk rock australian chick. I love it.
queen
I prefer the live videos you do  but I gotta say this was well done  mel! as to the subject matter  I will never understand the lefts obsession with sex as it has to infiltrate every aspect of   well... everything. I want to watch a movie or play a video game without that crap. I can watch corn if thats the case. great job on the video  mel
I think her arm where she holds the magnet and uses it to throw stuff should have been made bigger with a lot of metallic parts added to it  sort of like doom fist but not to the same extent. that way it puts forward the idea that that arm is an important part of her kit and where much of her power lies. a bulkier arm frame would have also shown thatshe s a tank much better. also  I feel like her face paint should have more saturation to be closer to her hair colour  I think that d look nicer and yes her emotions should closely match the 2d art style. confident of herself but also cunning.
its not just blizzard thats doing this its every game company movies u name it their doin the same things
makes me sad  that I once enjoyed this game
bruh what she is literally so cool.
so... 2 things 1- this comment section is bizarre  its like a bunch of androids that time traveled from 2016 lmao2- as far as I cantell  this video seems to review a characters worth  not off her mechanics and gameplay  none have been officially revealed yet   but off her look and perceived  character   while also criticizing blizzard for apparently  only focusing on looks . this might be one of the funniest videos comment sections Ive seen in a while
I think she looks great and I cant wait to play her  she is a tank fact you dont even know thatshows you dont know what youre talking about. half this video was you complaining about what a small percentage of fans asking about her sexuality. I dont like forced agendas either but thats fans asking who cares what fringe fans ask about.
if she was released with earlier no one would have said thatshe looks like an npc  think about it tbh
let s be honest  its the rule 34 thats the only reason why people stay interested in overwatch. and Im predicting thatshe wont be very popular in that regard  even among the  omg slay queen  folks on twitter.
I give junkerqueen a 3 out of 10 macs
the first red flag to ow going down hill was when the canceled orders for the graphic novel. that was when they started retconning their characters with forced diversity.
blizzard will never unapologetically create anything of significant substance again  thatship sailed when they merged with hacktavision.
she looks like a new fortnite skin
but thumbs up for this video format. it ll be great mixed in with what you started this channel with. keep it up!
replaying to the question around the 7 min mark-looking at rule 34  ___  !!
rule 34 is the only value overwatch have now as a former player
as someone who was a huge overwatch player  I fully agree. though overwatch 2 as a whole looks to be missing the mark imo. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
if people are calling her woke  they should stop. she shows a lot of skin and has pretty nice cleavage for a supposed woke character. a lot of guys find her kinda attractive. me included. she s like a borderlands character.
while I dont play overwatch anymore I still like the character designs  and I agree junker queen feels a bit disappointing despite her  sexy abs   hopefully the alternate skins of junker queen look better than her default skin.also blizzard were stupid to open the flood gates to the sexuality shipping crowd  they are usually quite extremist and unhinged  and in some fandoms send death threats to creators if their character dies or dont end up with however they shipped them with   this is pandora s box for entertainment culture and a metaphorical minefield  one wrong step and it explodes in their faces  I hope they enjoy walking on eggshells all the time because thats what they will be doing with a playerbase like that.
she literally did the meme  there are only two sexualities in video games  straight and political.  stay mad lol
yeah Ive been scrolling through and your the first person to mention this lol  the first 3 odd minutes are actually talking about the character  and the rest are about some wierd strawman where like two people are obsessed with sexuality and surface level character traits as if they weren t litteraly two minutes ago criticising junker queen for not being feminine enough lol
the video is literally just about the character s appearance on first impression and how itseems purposely  according to current sociopolitical agendas  nondescript compared to the more dynamic original concept art. no mention about the  worth  of the character. this is a thing that people do  critique visual art. not that complicated my dudes lol
I agree with every single point you said but I dont agree with the junker queen analysis. although shes definitely nowhere near the splash art she manages to feel really unique in my opinion. but looks aside. shes so much fun to play! like holy crap she feels amazing to just get in on peoples face and just chug through the enemy team. great video essay! I really think you hit a lot of points right on the mark and I hope blizzard also goes back to focusing more on how characters fit in gameplay.
I definitely think junker queen is one of the weakest looking characters in terms of design. I agree her look is way too busy and they should ve just tried to translate the 2d art into 3d better. I loved the cape she use to have  and their design philosophy is very odd and disingenuous..I think asking about her sexuality is odd too although  I have to disagree with the statement that a character s personal details are irrelevant just because ovw is a shooter game. as you said   the unique cast of characters was one of overwatch s strongest points. there s dialogue  story missions  comics  and soon to be an entire pve campaign that focuses on these characters. even games like apex have expanding lore about their heroes because the story goes on both inside the playable shooter matches and outside. there s a story to be told and I think thats pretty cool
oooo very professional
I completely agree I feel they just slapped the movement together too
the other issue is that these background are lost in places like china.
I actually like her design and she s a bleed-based bruiser tank in case the massive nba physique wielding a jagged battle axe  knife and shotgun wasn t obvious about this. I think the tank roster needed more brutal and badass heroes in the roster  with the exception of roadhog  sigma  rein  considering the fact that there s a monkey  a hamster  a gamer girl and a robot cow thing versus the dps having a cyborg ninja  time-traveling pilot  stealthy hacker  cold-blooded sniper  a ronin archer  two western themed outlaws  egyptian iron-man  an explosives maniac and most importantly b.o.b... Imean seriously  canthe tank roster please get a kickass hero blizzard proceeds to give a bloodthirsty gladiator champion that rules over junkertown  who fights not one but three people simultaneously in sudden-death to earn that crownaaah yes  yes please. we ll take that thank you very much.and no  I dont give two shits about her gender  her dating preferences  whether she likes mac and cheese... I just want to play cool characters and I think she s cool.
now I want a male character in destiny 2 with beer belly for inclusivity and body positivity
lol spot on with the comment about rule 34.
Im honestly getting back into the game just for her. my weakness is tomboys with abs
I both agree and disagree with some of the things said.
I think sexuality can be a very valid characteristic to include when designing a character for an action game like overwatch  it can be very much a part of the fantasy of playing that character. just take a look at league  who ve done this well  samira  and evelyn both stand out because they play into their sexuality as part of their character concept. but this  this ain t it dog. youre 100  right melonie.
surprised no one asked if she was vegan     does she eat meat      not really sure what the queen s place is in the game.   swings a weapon and shows her abs.   like doomfist     does sexuality make a difference in the gameplay of overwatch 2   shrugdid anyone ask about the sexuality of winston or orisa     p--- zarya is the queen!   welcome to the gun show    xd
I expected a mech champ. was disappointed.
I dont usually allow junker queen blasphemy but this was well put. you honestly changed my mind in a way.
nice abs
tbh  I think the design changes are borderline negligible and you basing your opinion on a single image from 2017 says more about your personal preference than what blizzard was probably going to do at any point. the truth is there was basically nothing to base our preconceptions other than thatspecific image. jq currently looks like a buff  rough woman  call her a snu-snu amazon if you want. considering her personality and her gameplay  the current design fits her perfectly.imo  your problem is thatshe s less cute than what the first designed showed her to be. thats it. you like cute characters and she is less cute. but Im not buying the whole wokeness narrative here. claiming the design was changed because of  woke  people wanting to change it is a retarded opinion at best and a dishonest one at worst.
I didn t know melonie had a genius iq when she has prep time.
is it just me or is the overwatch 2 trailer trying to go for that borderlands vibe  its just a bit odd.
good and honest review  I didn t know I agreed with the some of the things you said till you said them and laid out the statistics. although  I cant blame the devs for how a community reacts to a character  asking about their orientation and whatnot. they only have the checklist that influenced jq because of those like the people who wrote those twitter comments being so prominent  and I think enough blame is on the community to mention they re guilty of omission for not pushing the idea that we care more about style and gameplay than rep  to the devs enough obviously dont since like you pointed out more of the questions where about her sexuality and stuff than what she does in game. you harped on the idea that they should go back to giving no fxxxs with their designs but ow has been at a low for a long time  I think their hands are tied on some fronts to make sure ow2 launches as well as possible  if that means pandering for now to the loudest voice who ll recommend their friends and followers to get into the game as well then  I cant blame them for business practices.
lacks identity but you wants her to be focused on a stereotype  maybe she is just a tomboy with neutral features.
@alatar the blue
@alatar the blue  junker queen is still better than any female character from kevin smith s he man series. I dont hate her  but I cant stand the chicks in thatseries. they re horrible. new teela makes me wanna vomit.
I have a couple brain cells in my head somewhere
I dont its a stable business practice by any means to keep future heroes made in mind with the formula jq was made with  but I doubt they re stupid enough to do it longer than they need to. 1 out of 32 33    character being bland isn t that alarming in my opinion.
girly girls dont like tomboys. they really dont. lmfao
oh look  punky blue hair  sideshave  quirked eyebrow  crop top. that is the possibly the most generic  focus-grouped character Ive seen  even for overwatch. I swear  if the guys who created tank girl were gunslingers...
there s a lot of really weird projection and assumptions here  for one  Ive seen nothing but insane praise for her design  clearly a lot of people find her attractive especially-- which  to be honest is probably why people are asking her sexuality more than anything. I promise  the lesbians are interested  thats why they want to know. and lets not act like attraction has never been a selling point for overwatch characters  at least they didn t frame her ass for the cover. if the fanfic-y fans want to know who she d best be shipped with  let them do it. what else are they supposed to get out of overwatch s lack of narrative anyhow other than speculate on the heroes  mundane personal lives.this weird fixation you have about her gender expression I completely disagree with as well  because for one  giving her a softer and more   idk what youre trying to convey  flirty  I guess    personality would not have fit her voice and tone. you can clearly hear in junker town thatshe s aggressive and blunt  kinda a rock star personality. and she is literally a rock star  she plays guitar. her whole design screams tank girl energy  who also balanced between masculine and feminine.  personally  I actually expected her to be meaner and more blood thirsty  but there s a reason she isn t. she s a hero  a good guy. not because of gender expression at all-- she has moral values that make her softer in personality  more forgiving and merciful. I thought she was going to be more antagonistic and morally gray  thats my only dissonance with her. would she have been more fun to me personally if she was just full blown blood sports queen  maybe. but that has nothing to do with diversity  this was a narrative choice. and one I understand  it does make her more fit to join the overwatch team if she s known as a good and fair leader. they made her more lighthearted. maybe thats the real muddiness youre picking up on though  thatshe s not extreme enough  but again  focusing on that through her gender and not the character writing in general is just paranoid. the anti-woke perspective is increasingly becoming like a conspiracy theory with people at this point. you spent half the video ranting about gay people being marketed in media and not even talking about why junker queen s design could have been better.design wise  my only complaint is that they should have put more blue on the lower part of her body maybe  and if a more distinct silhouette is what youre looking for  maybe she needs her details made bigger  like bigger spikes or a cape or something  but honestly I think it is impossible to mistake the 7 foot tall  dual wielding  mohawk wearing woman in a ripped band t-shirt for anything other than either a playable character or a boss battle. definitely not a random npc  let s not exaggerate.
in any way  absolutely none  zero.
when it released  overwatch was the prime example of good character design. you cantell just by looking at the characters who they are and what they do. tracer is a fun  spunky girl with a quick hit-and-run play style. reaper  the edgeLord king all about the impending doom  getting behind the enemy line and  well  reaping. soldier 76 is an obvious play on the dudebro call of duty guy  but his bright colors tell us he s something more. these design here of junkie mcqueen says nothing. she s stronk and has axe  ok  so she can do some melee things  she ll need to be tank-y to manage that in a team-shooter. but she doesnt have any armor to speak of like the existing tank design language suggests. so is she going to be a squishy high damage character  she doesnt have any apparent movement option to give her the edge she needs to sneak in. design should clue the player in to what she does  and this just doesnt.
Ive seen and heard the complete opposite.
just check out the reader requests from the author of the manga one piece. everyone actually asks the favorite food of all the characters. they are nerds and want to learn all that they can about their favorite characters. if you personally dont gain anything from that knowledge  just ignore it and stop crying.
I think her design is just okay  but she looks extremely fun to play. hopefully her other skins are better.
junker queen is dynamite
nice pro-style review and format! was like watching ign...sans the beta male voice. your roots in the biz are obvious.junker queen looks like a female orc character I have in wow  except butchier
she looks like a ripoff of 2 apex characters smashed together.
I think she looks better in the cinematic than in-game. could be a difference in quality  but soon as I heard  woke agendas  at 7 23 is when I knew this review was off. this argument of the devs focusing on the characters  sexualities is just so weird  especially since they cant control the people who are so focused on that. I agree its weird to care for the junker queen s sexuality  and you were right with how the devs release info on characters just to save them from media backlash  but this argument  this video  holds no value. its so directionless. from what Ive seen  very few are concerned with her sexuality. its just some odd ones here n there  which is given so much attention in this video. you make itseem as if all of the lgbt s or something is creating a huge fuss about it  or that the devs are  but they re not. overwatch s main selling point still is their unique characters  and how different they play in-game. random people caring for a new character s sexuality doesnt change that. also   playing itsafe   her design is the opposite of safe. a muscular woman design will always be ridiculed  especially from people like you and these commenters.
no one said anything about her sexuality except you. a lot of the ppl in the comics are assuming that because she has more masculine features she automatically is not a straight character. I think you are nitpicking details about her because you dont like them not because they are bad. women can have masculine features  its ok!
bro what  you are acting like they gave us a character that was a basic white blonde chick wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans. the character has plenty of personality in her style and alot of variety. you basically just spent 10 minutes crying about it not being exactly the same as the concept art to get ad revenue.
agree 100 . the whole sexualization of characters is just a distraction from the game itself and imo it hinders the creative process. its like in college when you had to write a 10 page paper  but you could say everything you needed to in 5 pages. the other 5 pages was simply filler that no longer made the original paper your own. if that makes any sense whatsoever. Im exhausted.
subjective
I think her character is fine. I agree that blizzard kind of missed the mark when it comes to combining femininity and masculinity for the junker queen  but I wouldn t go as far to say she completely lacks character because of it and it makes her an npc. I still think she has a cool and spunky personality and style  just her overall design is eh.
feels like a lot of nitpicking and the rant against the people who asked what her sexuality wasn t needed as they clearly got ratio d into oblivion showing they re obviously a minority. this rant feels like its going at that massively controversial hexagon where they rated characters based on categories such as gender and ethnicity but that doesnt impact the real character design process  character designers said that it was not used by them at all so it was just a separate team showing it to the ceos  while still trashing on their company for that image existing showing that it wasn t just to save face . what sparked this whole video also feels insanely nonimportant  that junkertown queen wasn t clearly feminine or masculine in their design approach. she has the title of queen in a society comprised of riffraff where strength determines your status  of course she s going to fall in the middle. you dont have to be a hardcore body builder to be muscular  and junkertown queen just aligns with this group. I believe she still stands out among the roster by taking this approach  having her built more like zarya would come across as repetitive so I appreciate the type of athlete physique they went with. you also claimed thatshe didn t land well  which just appears to be projecting as she was received well.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that I never heard of this video game ever and so I have played it and I just want to tell you that it is okay typed of video game to play and so I just want to tell you that you should try play it and see how you like it after you play it  ok melonie. anyway have a great day and week melonie.
imagine someone telling you youre a bland mix of feminine and masculine qualities band should just stick to one
what
how sexy the characters were really helped get people interested in the game but specifically going for them and screwing over creativity is backward and strange considering blizzard was trying to destroy rule 34 of this game earlier
that must hurt to hear
holy crap  this whole video is basically the rants people had about ow to begin with when it first came out  but this person was late to the party and is now regurgitating the same thing  but when the game has mostly run its course lmao. I guess its easier to say you can predict  get woke go broke  when talking about a game thatstarted woke half a decade ago  and already had most of its base leave after the initial popularity
its funny how youre not really giving any viable arguments and instead went for a  itsimply doesnt look that good  kind of explanation. thats painfully subjective. overall I think this character has been very well received.
a lot of people  what s her sexuality me  does she play well in the game
lol... this was a pretty disappointing review. I wanted to hear about her abilities and instead I got story about how you dont like people wondering about a characters life. lore is a huge part of overwatch and most people want more. side note  you said people should ask how she affect the game.  there was a whole reveal event where they talked about each ability and how she is attack focused. how much more do you want
the overwatch shipping community and rule 34 community are the worst. the company started catering to them and then suddenly out of nowhere pre-existing characters became gay. dont get me started with apex legends cast of characters.
I kinda think overwatch s window has passed and this reveal for the game was underwhelming. there s a series on youtube called  death of a game  that discussed the problems overwatch had after a strong year 1 and a most revolved lack of a clear design philosophy  e.g. trying to determine if the game would be more casual or competitive . this new character is almost symbolic of the problems overwatch 1 had in its life cycle. almost all traits and stylistic choices used for junker queen seem to be designed just to check boxes  blizzard even has a real dev system for this too  and miss what made overwatch 1 really good.
lacks identity  yea idk about that  well designed character through and through and pretty fresh for the game. dont know what u mean by a  bland of the 2  when shes clearly feminine and has well placed masculinity lol. not sure why that also matters so much when it inherently has no issues if you ve watched the new reveal cinematic and story trailer. her archetype is fine and her character persona looks solid.
wait where is the daily Bible verse noooooooooooo!
people asking about her sexuality are just fans wanting to know if they are represented  could date her if she was real and what not. leave the weeds be and let them be weeds. not a problem.
youre a bit late on this party where were you when they retcon and turned the soldier character gay
its sad that the community will talk negatively on a character based on looks and not the actual gameplay  what world do I even live in  there are so many complainers complaining about the wrong thing
so junker queen is yet another bland  generic virtue-signal character designed for people who probably dont play video games in the first place in order to pander   par for the course.  tracer being gay was one thing  it may have been disappointing because she had thatspunky tomboy vibe that is appealing to a majority of men  but it was accepted and people moved on.  what s her name with the huge booba and muscles was a bold step  trying to appeal to the dommy mommy  please step on me  crowd  but it had an audience.  who does jq appeal to   I know from twitter there s the transtrender crowd that gushes over her  but metric-wise  its a tiny percentage.  no streamer Ive watched on twitch has even mentioned her or how excited they are for her debut.
I agree  also the cinematic is so bad
it really shows when the majority of people agreeing with the content of this video start off by saying  I dont wont play overwatch  but I agree.
she doesnt have the same overwatch energy as the rest of the cast imo. perhaps leaning towards generic  it just doesnt feel right  yet I cant put my finger on it
finally  someone who agrees thatsexuality isn t the most important thing to making a good fps game.
she is quick  she is tanky  she is besutiful  she is funny  she is commanding  she brings a power scattershot gun  a knoife nsmed grcie and a giant axe to bring the wreconning.she is the originsl roadhog. she is aussie af and speaks tough as she is. the doubters are wrong and I know because I played her and I am presenting my experience in a calm manner.the junker queen is a powerful pusher  her muscles belies a tough exterior but she is tall snd very feminine  especislly when compared to zarya. zarya is a heavy weight  junker queen looks like a mid weight but shes no push over.and her scream is  powerful cry that builds additionsl health and speed for her snd anyone around her.she is not bland and her cinematic is xxxxxxx awesome with cooler music.I appreciate your tone melenie  its not inherently bad and if you think thus way then fine  but the hater  well haters gonna hate roight.junker queen aint perfect  but shes a hella fun. she is my queen and her muscles are fine.shout out to yhe junker queen!
I still haven t heard a good reason as to why an overwatch 2 needed to exist...either way f ck blizzard.
this review is horrible  instead of giving criticism and trying to find a solution  you just throw the current issues of overwatch as a whole towards a single character. junker queen looks like a great character with a bright and snappy hairstyle  probably the most skin shown  she stands out more than meI or soldier or ashe. if youre judging the character as a whole  you should wait till all the details are out.
junker queen looks fun
the beta is there to find that out. they dont know how she plays outside of their tests. how do you people not understand that
pre existing characters became straight too lol
blizzard wanted to destroy the rule 34 community in the early days
me neither bizzare video. if you know anything about melonies past she basically has had the same aesthetic as junker queen for some time. tats all over not traditionally femm I dont get it maybe she feels attacked.
junker queen is just a lame diluted version of tank girl. she doesnt have the real grit that you d expect from the queen of the junkers. she looks like a poseur.
@ineed333quid  well I have no idea who tank girl is  if ur saying because she s a girl and isn t big enough to be a tank physically then go look at sigma. how are you to say she has no real grit after seeing her story trailer  you either didn t lol or have some form of bias for w e personal reason. that or you dont know the definition of grit either as she evidently showed quite alot compared to other  junkers
tell me you didn t bother to actually look at the art work vs the finished character  I also recommend you actually look at the art for other characters that do actually match the complicated characters.
@irish not sane  who are u talking to lol  also if ur referring to the junk queen art work  her prior iteration was alot less interesting and pretty bland. alot slimmer more like a dps  this video in itself was goofy. junk queen looks good  sounds good  prob feels good to play
@sundragonbro  well google her. Im not talking about her physical size or about whether she should be a tank or not  Im saying her design doesnt come across as authentic  it feels very uninspired. it doesnt convey real grit.
@ineed333quid   just google her  not a good counter argument  and when I did I found people that looked even more stereotypical. everything can come across as unoriginal tbh its 2022 u dont think nearly every possible conceivable trope or archetype  character stereotype hasn t been done by now  I dont think that invalidate someone attempt to making their own version of it in a manner they want to. I dont see your point because its clearly inspired by multiple archetypes lmao. if u cant see it yourself personally then thats you  opinions are great  but saying its flat out uninspired is wrong. sounds like u just dont like it cuz u just dont like it  makes no sense imo
dont know what she meant by bland  Imean she literally goes on about it for like a minute but mainly she referred to how the splash art design was more interesting to her because it had slimmer  sharper features  like look at her chin and jaw and cheek bones  and the eyes weren t so sunken in because the brow wasn t so prominent. she was obviously thinner and not as bulky and butch-looking as the final product. it looks bland and nondescript because her features aren t dynamic  i.e. she s not thin to look like a speed character or bulky to look like a power character  she talks about this at the end  and she s going purely on the initial announce tweet  so no point bringing up the story trailer. maybe if she watched that her opinion might change but this video is her initial impression of this character after hyping up a certain design of a character for 5 years and then switching it with a less dynamic one.keep in mind   dynamic  isn t an opinion  as you keep using words like  interesting  and  fresh . dynamic is one of the factors that go into the design things like comic book characters that make them look  larger than life  and archetypal. this junker queen doesnt have an appearance that tells you anything at a glance  and she might be based on several archetypes but its possible for a combination of things to end up making mush  like combining all colors of paint only to get a dull brown or grey. which is fine  tracer and others on the original roster are bland looking in thatsense and it doesnt make them bad designs. what melonie is addressing is the fact that her and many other fans were expecting one look and got another  and how lately there seems to be a lot of reason in pop culture for  subverting expectations  that way to spite fansyou can disagree just fine  but guys like you and @saucy ketchup in this thread have this weird way of expressing your opinions where you try to make it look like the other person is stupid for disagreeing with you  and you seem to be trying hard to do that here lol
@slick ric  ty for repeating the video to me  obviously she didnt see the new trailers and this is her impression as I never even commented about that originally. she probably looks a bit different because the original 3d video trailer of her was before she was queen. I call things out how I see it and explain myself as so  if that is too harsh for you or seems too unbearably rude as ur implying then I apologize for being cohesive lmao. a bit ironic that u think thats also  trying the hardest  with the essay u gave
she s pretty bland looking overall  but I think she looks extremely fun to play. I will say overwatch s recent character design hasn t been fantastic.
@slick ric  another example of what youre saying.she has a trihawk  and she s dyed the overgrown bits instead of shaving it. who the fuck does that  it looks worse  there s very good practical reasons why you dont do it in real life  its harder  it looks bad  and its less extreme so less of a dynamic part of her appearance.also trihawk thats only one colour  thats practically unheard of  she could ve had green blue pink  black blue black  pink blue pink. world of opportunity and they just went all blue  its so uninspired.why why why is she lettin her trihawk get overgrown and then dying the overgrown bits  I cant get over that. she s look so much better if she had a proper trihawk  if it was just freshly shaven or just not dyed over the overgrown bits  why the f would anyone ever do that irl
@saucyketchup  imagine slurping blizzard
and if you think sexuality is irrelevant in this type of game you could say the same for anything than defines their character lore wise. everything that builds up the characters make them more interesting and wether you like the characters  personality  appearance and what they represent will affect how much you like the game. if you think overwatch isn t about the lore of the characters they might swell look like blobs shooting out uninteresting hit boxes...
@elias bremer  before the overwatch characters sexualitys were revealed but the lore was known how much did it add to what we knew about them
I think you need to chill alittle bitshe just got released your just making assumptions at this point and its not like they just forced the sexuality thing for tracer it was just part of her back story they dont shove it in your face and we dont even know the queens sexuality
original roadhog  lol sure bud.
blizzard may be bad  but ea is still way worse. lol
Im confused by a contradiction in melonie s statements.  newfound obsession with a character s sexuality being such a pivotal focus on their entire personality  and  history of at random shoehorning irrelevant identity-based details into pre-existing characters  which is it  you cant really complain about it both ways. soldier 76 s sexuality was not an important part of his personality. he is a soldier first and foremost  and so it makes sense that that was only revealed a fair bit later that he had at least one male partner in the past  when reaquainting with a more emotionally focused old friend.tracer is younger  more happy-go-lucky  so it makes a lot more sense for her to be rather open and chatty with information about her romantic life.I ll criticsize blizzard activision happily  there is a lot that they re falling short on. but the way they ve done some representation in overwatch so far has been decent.
at first I agreed with the take about junkerqueen s kind of bland character design but I quickly became disillusioned when you started talking about diversity checkboxes and woke points... looking at the rest of your videos its clear I am not welcome here!! goodbye happy pride
super bum
completely disagree. we have enough feminine female characters in overwatch. junker queen is a welcome addition to a diverse cast.
wot everyone s hyped
I dont like junker queens ingame model it feels very weirdly lanky and  buff at the same time and feels like a major downgrade from the poster on junker town. btw the reason behind the designs being  plastered with  diversity  is the king diversity space tool which has been implemented at blizzard which leeds to designs just made to fill a check box instead of organic ones we saw in ow1.
people still play overwatch  literally the only characters I like are genjI  hanzo  mcgee  and dva
wish they just ripped off tank girl
mad maggie from apex is better designed.
hate too disagree but I still play overwatch  cringe I know  and I haven t heard a single person say they dont like the junkerqueen design and as far as the diversity measurement thing the design team has already said the dont use thatstupid thing and that they just use there eyes I dont mind people not liking the design but I kinda mind it when someone say that fans were underwhelmed because we weren t
have u ever heard of skins
no Bible verse today
no she isnt wut
where s my representation where is the puerto rican who is loud and yells hey papI lol these companies trying to be woke but ignore me lol
y all who s this
comment for the algorithm
aaw no verse of the day
character isnt even out yet and she is underwhelming ok
hmmm.
this review is super monotone.
ngl I agree as welljunker queen to me stands out so much since her design is so in touch with junker town and seems suiting. also we never had a proper punk like character in ow before. her being masculine nor feminine isn t much of a deal to me and Im doing character design for game dev in collage and I think having a character that isn t in a certain area makes them feel more of a character. I just cant wait to play as her when she comes out since her ability s had been leaked prior to her release and looks like its legit due to the trailer
diversity only split people appart  while give a sense of superiority to the ones who conform to their rules
@molfredoelgrande  literally no. you want everyone to look and act the same  thats boring asf. individuality is diversity.
@molfredoelgrande  I dont understand how that can split people apart because having diverse characters help to have more of an audience than just having same ish characters that are very similar which only could attract not much people onto a game  show etc.
also from having such different characters will help with overwatch so much especially more support and tank characters which junkerqueen is tank n fox girl support  assuming from trailer .
exactly. well said.
really  I think she looks great.... I would have never thought people would view her negatively.
lmao I thought this would be 10 minutes of serious analysis. instead  I got 10 minutes of strawmanning. expected coming from a person that uses the term  woke agenda  unironically tho lmao
l take
I dont want to seem like a hater of you cause I just know you but I dont know why are you hating a cinematic. and I have read in the comments that blizzard is sexist  blizzard foment the sexuality... whatever. why do you think that ow2 wont be anything in the future or just jukerqueen   why   can you give them a second oportunity  I know that everyone have our opinions and points of view  but I dont think that invent things is the best way to comment something by the way. my comment is not to you its for everyone.an afer all obviously I am not gona hate you to give your opinion guys  but give them an opportunity pls.I now ow finished really bad  but ow2 will reborn it  but with this videos you dont help.
aren t she is a first trans women charactor in game. used to be ex-overwatch member. there is old photo of original overwatch team shes on the left of the photo not yet transitional
blizzard never mentioned her sexually or anything so I dont see how thats the reason for bad design. how do comments from random people on twitter mean that blizzard is trying to push an agenda with this hero
antI sjws bch about everything.
why does every shredded female character in anything have to be butch  square enix does a great job at ripped chicks but keeping them feminine.
eww lol
what a sad youtube channel
what is with this weird  I dont need no man  haircut trend that is popping up everywhere in female antagonist  you know it when you ve seen it and 9 10 times the character is poorly written and laughably forgettable
this reading from a script really doesnt work for you  it feels fake and forced and not natural with no natural flow.
lol what a terrible  conservatie take.
I bet you anything that junker queen is a butch lesbian  because of course she will be. you cant have any new cis caucasian characters  because thats not what they believe to be  diverse  anymore.
overwatch is underwhelming all together
a dislike for the boom in your name  have a nice day
Im not surprised. new blizzard doesnt like femininity so of course they made her forgettable.
this is such a boring hater take
looks like some generic mobile game enemy
big meh from me - overwatch is dead
not negatively  just disappointing.
I think youre way of the mark
not her  they did for soldier 76 and tracer  long after both characters and the game were released  which felt like vapid pandering to a certain crowd of unhinged twitter activists  obsessed with gender identity and sexuality  not something genuine or well thought out  same thing like rowling did in harry potter  suddenly deciding that dumbledore was gay retroactively but nobody noticed .which is why melonie is highlighting the people asking about junker queen s sexuality on the blizzard forums twitter  because thats exactly the crowd blizzard chose to pander to  instead of asking how she plays the first thing they ask about is who she sleeps with and what pronouns she has  thats not the kind of crowd that cares about gameplay balance or quality art  so why would blizzard care themselves!
@ascendantstoic  I been played since the beta and tracer has always been gay  it just never really got mentioned until months after release.and in game she just has like once voiceline on the kings row map saying saying she s going to see emily or something but like you would have no idea that emily is supposed to be her girlfriend or that tracer is gay from just hearing her voicelines in game. as for solider him being gay comes from a short story with an image of him holding up a picture of someone who he used to know and ana ask if he s been keeping tabs on him and he just says that he deserved a better life of some shit than to be with a him  a vigilante.I think the way they handle sexuality is fine  its not like they just randomly went on twitter and said tracer and solider are gay. and 99  of real players dont even care  we just want a fun game  the blizzard devs can write smut stories for all I care  the people writing comics and short stories for the lore aren t the same people who are balancing the game or designing new hero abilities.
@lil wintery  neither of them were gay when the game was announced and released  I too preordered the game and had been playing the game since the beta  all the way back when bastion had shields   all the stuff you mention was added much later shortly before the announcements  which looked like very clear pandering at the time  many people called them out on that at the time.and it reeks of corporate mandates  not artistic vision genuine passion  same as the change for mccree s name as well  when characters sexuality and names change based on corporate mandates everything about them just feels hollow and contrived as a result.
fr  she made a 10 minute video about someone asking for a character s sexuality on twitter  pretty sad.
I should write a character like that  but her fatal flaw is pissing off everyone around her  along with getting herself and her whole team into bullshitsituations.
bland female heroine  first off  she is probably not a hero. she s the junker queen. we dont even know her character yet as she s only been teased so far. and bland  no. she s punk af  and exudes  Im a  fuck you up  vibes.
sounds like your reading a magazine article verbatim.  not giving commentary on a topic. this is weird  and not boom at all.
yea
I wrote it lol
