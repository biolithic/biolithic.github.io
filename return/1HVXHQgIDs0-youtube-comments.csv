thank you for putting these videos out  and for inspiring others to do better with their lives. Ive had a very rocky relationship with the Lord these past few years and you ve got me to pick up the Bible once again. Im on the path towards healing  so thanks.

melonie you know this feels unreal right  Christian gamer girl reading Bible verses  such a rare find. Im so damn lucky to be honest

came for the problematic gamer takes. stayed for the Bible verse of the day.

amen to all that. if more people took the time to listen to their hearts and practice their faith without fear  this world would be a much better place. but  its up to all of us to keep our faith and help others practice theirs as well  let them practice their religions and beliefs without someone saying  oh your culture is wrong or your faith in God is stupid. I say a prayer every night before I sleep and every morning before I get out of bed and start my day and I think by reconnecting with my faith  I have become more stronger and healthier for it. so  thank you  melonie. not just as my long time friend. but  as someone who is keeping the faith when so many continue to lose it. may God s love  wisdom and guidance always be with you. much love and respect to you  my friend.

I just found your channel  but I gotta say your heavier takes sold me.  keep crushing it.

I really appreciate the message in your verse of the day today.although the deck can seem stacked against us  we should never give up trying to be good. we are definitely not going to be perfect and our good works aren t going to be enough  eph 2 8-9 for it is by grace you have been saved  through faith and this is not from yourselves ...but that doesnt mean you stop trying.the haters out there would benefit from tuning in.
