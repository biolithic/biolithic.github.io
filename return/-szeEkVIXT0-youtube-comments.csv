I 100  agree that we should be treating mental diseases instead of celebrating them. I have bipolar and I got help over 13 months ago. with proper medication and weekly therapy  I can say that getting help was the best decision of my life. everyone  especially men who have bipolar reading this message  youre not alone  there s help and you will get better. youre in my thoughts and I believe in you. dont give up  youre important and you have worth in this world.
