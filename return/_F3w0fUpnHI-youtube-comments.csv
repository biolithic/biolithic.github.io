hi melonie ive following you for a bit  but this one  helped me out. since ive been struggleing with my faith as a chirstian  and trying to understand the   turn the other cheek ... thanks for bible references. keep it up  your channel is becoming one of my favorits,

the bible tells us to hate evil. i also believe in the righteous fury of god too. thank you  melonie  for shining a light on how christians are supposed to be pussified and passive believers.,

i just found your channel. i m so pleased to see someone so bold and willing to state their beliefs. this is great. i m a subscriber now.!!!!,

love it when you bring in scripture to your videos. and you re right. christians shouldnt be pushovers. jesus commanded us to sell our cloaks and buy swords  after all.
