I would love to see a Bible study video about what you were talking about at the end. 

Ive only recently started reading the Bible again and am by no means an expert. Im always open to hearing insight from those that have it.

the Bible verses and minI discussion are half the reason Im here  they re great!

your advice to eat beef.  since then I  have leaned up and noticeably visibly see that Ive lost fat. as a result I have now lost 50  pounds and only have 10 more to go.  240 to 187 as of today  thanks for your great content on the channel!
