i love this woman so much gives me faith there s still normal women out there

this stuff is all so disturbing. takes a lot of courage for you to call it out. stay strong in your faith   also  for the record  you are a very beautiful woman. never doubt that

let's pray for him and his family.

yeah  this is crazy. kids can t even watch youtube videos without this stuff being pushed in front of them. the children need to be protected at all costs. god bless you for speaking out against these mel. jesus loves you sister.

you show courage by speaking out about things like this and yes i think it is demonic oppression in many cases. never let anyone stop you from speaking the truth. and never let anyone stop you from sharing jesus with everybody.

it takes a lot to acknowledge any wrongs within ourselves and to change. seek jesus and he will give you the strength  grace  and forgiveness to get through what happened.
atleast you were able to self reflect and realize the mistake

thank you so much heck ton  i just love her wholesomeness

i admire how you re spirituality  and i do agree there are in fact satanic works at play corrupting our world.

mel you are my favourite jesus freak. own it sister  the enemy shows his head - we are duty bound to knock it off. we are not of this world  -  much love!

if you re a  jesus freak  then i'm proud to say i'm one too. when are we going to allow people to live freely.

jesus... take the wheel. no  for real  you drive.

wait  melonie is a fellow christian

if she's a  crazy jesus freak  then so am i and i'm an atheist. she's just speaking the truth.

don't quit  ms. melonie! you re not alone in being called a  crazy jesus freak.  but you are speaking words that encourage us  regular lay folks  and we will keep supporting you as best as we can. just keep believing and speaking truth.

i wish there were more streamers like you tbh. its so hard to find people on twitch that don't just dis christianity

it s so refreshing to see sane people still exist on youtube!  thank you!!

100 percent on the nose. you rock.

you get my sub for not being afraid to say it this is demonic

just found your chn   thanks for speaking up  i really enjoyed your last couple vids and agreed with just about everything you had to say so your not alone
it s weird how im an atheist but i still agree with 99  of what you re saying. you didn t mention lara though.

thank you melonie  for your time and effort . you said nothing but the truth .keep it up girl   tc

the promotion of the ideology that chris mentioned in his tweet needs to be stopped. brittany speaks of it in her videos as well. thank you for your bravery  melonie. stay safe.
