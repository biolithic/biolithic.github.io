Im not even Christian but I just love how yourespect your faith and religion. your videos are excellent melonie! thank you for making them! Im your biggest french fan! also Im learning english a lot when Im watching your videos!

Im a Christian  but I sin. every time I do  I feel horrible about it. I ask God for forgiveness. what I dont do is demand people celebrate my sins.

Ive been feeling a pull towards faith again the past couple years.  Im interested in hearing more and more about it.  thank you for being a brave  strong Christian.
how did anyone who was involved or who allowed this to happen think this is a good idea

always  always  always appreciate it when you stand boldly on the front lines and speak the biblical truth! truth  by definition  is exclusive. there s no  variety of ways  to get to heaven  nor does God condone sin and perversion. calling depravity  variety  is just man trying desperately to justify sin.bless you  melonie  for everything youre doing! praying that God will keep his hedge of blessing and protection around you


melonie  videos like this have been some of the most instrumental catalysts for re-discovering my own faith. please know that this type of content from you is incredibly appreciated and is truly making an impact on others. unknowingly  I lived a life full of sin for over a decade  and I completely resonate with some of your own personal experiences in regard to suffering. for the first time in my life  I am learning the Bible every night and have started to truly understand the gospel. thank you for being brave enough to speak out against the true evil in this world. much love and respect.

you really poured your heart into this and itshows. thanks  melonie.

as a fellow Christian let me just say  best go boom video yet. speaking about your faith like this can be hard so thanks for making this melonie

thank you  melonie! I always appreciate this content  and appreciate yourelying on God s strength to deliver it!

I struggle so hard with my faith that I haven t considered myself a Christian for years. but I still really respect   appreciate good Christians with strong faith  like you melanie. and I think one of the best ways to evangelize to people is simply by being a good example of a Christian  let those around you see the goodness of your faith   belefs and be inspired by it  and that alone can make Christ more appealing to them.

you can rest asure that this did help at least 1 person. thanks you. Ive been struggling with my Christianity for a long time.  recently I feel like God I d speaking to me  
louder than ever and Ive  even rediscovering things. to long to type here. but I 100  get where you are coming from with so much of this. thank you for making this.
melonie  I always appreciate your videos where you share your faith. it takes a lot of courage.

as someone often around many lgbt people or lgbt supporting  both Christian and not  this really helpsive always had trouble when it came to offending people or the thought of it  but thanks for helping me stay rooted in my faithIm trying to grow closer because Ive been in a lil rebellion phase but Im hoping I can gain all the knowledge I need for the futureit helps that I have my sister who s rooted in faith right beside me the whole time helping me not to drift

ok  Ive listened to this twice thru while looking for the leopard .  good work  melonie! I feel like my time and money are worth it for this. dont quit gaming and culture videos  its just once in a while you have to enjoy a great steak of a video

I cant love this enough. well said in a respectful  loving way. thank you for your vulnerability.

I love your Christian posts.   especially when you get right into the word.   keep up the good work. God bless you.

thank you for sharing your story  melanie.  I ll be 37 soon and at times I feel distant from God  so its good to see someone else who was a prodigal child too.

keep speaking the truth  melonie!

I had a very rough time in my life in my walk with God  but what I learned is that he is never distant  we feel distant from him. take some time and tune out the noise  go for a hime or go camping  in the wilderness away from the noise and distractions is when you will feel how close he is.
mel   its awesome to see a strong believer   like yourself on here . the whole reason I stay subscribed is because you love Jesus as much as I do . people filled with the spirit are hard to come by in today s society.

I love your content  but these types of videos are my absolute favorite.  this was so eloquently spoken.  you even encouraged me to do better  and I teach this stuff in the same way to anyone that will listen to me in my daily walk.  excellent job.

greatly appreciate the video  melonie.youre not alone  and this was clearly laid on your heart for a reason. we all struggle in faith and life choices. its natural and comes with being a child of God. being a Christian does not mean we are perfect. and I suspect this video is God s way of getting that message out to those that need to hear it. continue to speak what God puts onto your heart. never again allow discouragement from others dictate your faith and practices. if you feel it needs to be said  then say it. satan wants to silence us and God s word. keep the faith and not allow him.

I would like to thank you for bringing God s word to the people.  as of right now  you ve reached 5.6k people with the gospel here.  some of us may be lucky to reach only one.  keep up the amazing work sister.

from one Christian to the another  God bless you for this video. this is probably the longest video Ive ever seen you put out. haha! I do agree loving others especially friends that you have that are not like you but you also have to realize that the ecosystem you choose to put yourself into is going to affect you and God knows that. you can pray for them and love them but it doesnt mean you have to associate yourself with what they re doing. we are to separate ourselves from stuff like that.
so glad you made this video . people need to hear that there not alone in this crazy world . love from the uk

proud of your boldness and clarity in this. God s word does not return void. praying for those who see this.

melonie  I its always so encouraging to see videos from you like this.  this  non-binary priest  is another example of how so many churches  Christians  are taking the Bible out of context or leaving out the parts they dont like in order to justify willfully living in sin.  be encouraged in the fact that you followed through with what the Lord laid on your heart to do.

thank you for opening up and sharing some of the challenges you have faced. never easy to do  but it helps.

its amazing to see you be so open about your faith. praise God

Im glad you put this out  love the content  itspoke to me and many others Im sure  the fact that its biblical on todays episode is well needed  thank you

I absolutely loved this. it really says a lot how connected this is to all the crazy stuff we re dealing with right now  and of course I always admire how you often share your faith in your videos  so dedicating one which really touches on that more than most is a definite plus. keep up the faith and all the amazing work. 


excellent vod  mel! this vod was very important to make and was very much needed! Im super proud of you for making this! agreed with everything you said! keep respecting your faith and religion and calling out sin! I have stuck with you through every cancel culture attempt and I will continue to do so! friends to the end and beyond!
I live in the uk and I apologize for this madness.

this is a fascinating video  your faith is inspiring even if I cant quite make the leap myself  even though many aspects of my life are an awful mess  illustrated by the fact that I listened to this while doing client billing at 10pm on a friday night and feeling utterly run down and ill from eating terribly.

I learned a lot from this video  melonie. I didn t realize just how serious sexual sin was until I watched this video even though I struggle with it as a man often with just how much of it is in our media. well  I just want to say that I repented and am once again walking with the Lord. keep up the good Christian work  melonie  and continue to be an inspiration.

just the other day I was thinking about how Im a gamer and a Christian man as well and how refreshing it would be to come across another person on social media that is too and bam! your videos started showing up. which Ive really been enjoying!  Ive been a follower of your page through facebook gaming for quite some time but I consume most of my media here on youtube. seeing how our father orders steps and raises people up to speak in boldness for such a time as this to spread the gospel and speak out against evils of this world is amazing!  makes me proud to see you be obedient to what gets laid on your heart.  we do get mocked or ridiculed for our belief in Jesus but we take it in joy and remember what roman 8 18-23 says. thats just one reminder that motivates me to keep running for Jesus! much love and keep up the great work!
thank you so much! really felt it heavy on my heart to make it  and it turned out a lot longer than my usual videos haha!

@melonie mac go boomÂ  we need someone like you to make these videos!
