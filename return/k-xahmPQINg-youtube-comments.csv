 please continue with verse of the day. even as an agnostic I feel some kind of calm when listening to verses from different religion. if you remove the religious perspective in them  they are very often  be a good person  and happiness will come . isn t thatsomething we all  regardless of belief can stand behind and put or faith in  also thank you for introducing me to the carnivore diet. Im not all in yet  but have increased the amount of meat and fat I eat at the same time as Ive removed pasta from my diet completely.

its the best when you read the long Bible verses!  keep up the good Lord s work  melonie!
