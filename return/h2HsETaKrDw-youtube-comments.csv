been a fan since day 1 of this channel. thank you for putting yourself out there to talk about these issues and putting voice to those opinions of our fan communities that would otherwise go ignored.one  single  30-something  irish american-indian  to another  happy valentine s day to you. keep doing what youre doing  girl  it makes a difference.

love to see another female libertarian! love your faith  and Ive never been more thankful for following jeremy s suggestion to pop over here    you keep doing you - Im here for it!

also I appreciate you for sharing your faith. its hard for me to share my faith around my friends because they are not Christians and I feel like they will have a  knee jerk reaction to me talking about it. I also am trying to get my faith back and in fellowship with the Lord because I got a little girl to worry about it. so we may not agree on everything but I appreciate you with your faith mel

unabashed outspoken faith in God.....its the new punk rock.

never knew you were libertarian but makes sense now. I think it takes more balls to admit that then adding a Bible verse. Ive taken more flak from the right for being a libertarian than from anywhere else but somehow at the same time the left only sees me as far right. its also nice to have another channel other than youngrippa to enjoy.

thanks for the Bible verse. it helps me reflect on how there is what culture says is right and wrong  and what God says is right and wrong. essentially watch out when riding modern cultures moral river  as it may just be headed over a waterfall.

Im not a Christian  but I do find wisdom in your Bible verse.

before your channel explodes and its a flurry of comments happens  just wanted to say that your voice is refreshing amongst  the message . thank you  fellow 80s carnivore diet baby!

@melonie mac go boomÂ  yep. Im new to your stuff  but its pretty cool. keep it up. the workout info is motivating too.
