ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment bout james gunn standing up to chris pratt s back  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today and week with your family   your brother and with your new baby nephew melonie. anyway have a great day and week melonie.

they just dont like him because he s a Christian.  he never said anything negative against the lbgt  community.  its good to see his director and other actors standing up for him.  from what people who know about him say about him  he s a nice guy who treats other people right.  if more people stood up to the mob and supported other viewpoints  maybe the wokies would just shut up.

hey melonie  thank you for the amazing channel ! I really enjoy your verse of the day. have you ever watched the how great is our God tour by louie giglio  if not it is life changing! I am praying for you!
