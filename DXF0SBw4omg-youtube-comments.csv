i forgot to upload my thumbnail  but i love the perfectly timed still too much to change it
when they asked simon tolkien his promised price  he smiled and stretched forth his hand to reveal 30 pieces of silver.
blackagon was first shown months ago  but didn t make that many waves. that s why some people have a vague memory of it.
i m black and even i m tired of this blackwashing  you can t just change a character race..tolkien would be rolling in his grave
regarding that last tweet you read aragorn s skin tone is actually described when frodo first meets him. after aragorn threw back his hood frodo saw that aragorn  strider as he then knew of him  had  in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.  aragorn is not a half-elf but he is descended from elves. elrond s brother elros who chose the doom of men  a choice given to the half-elven at the and of the first age to choose which peoples they would live as  was the first king of the d nedain.
i didn t think there d be a video today given the holiday  but i m sure glad to be wrong! always great to see you  melonie
favorite bit was when aragorn popped a 9ml cap into the mouth of sauron and said  for us! by us! stunning.
i am disappointed they did not make gandalf the black instead
oh boy!!! hope aragorn gets his own netflix show soon.  they can even say it may or may not be a documentary.
yes mtg did this with aragorn already
this happened months ago with mtg  hence the de jevu.making aragorn black totally messes with the lore. this now makes him an easterling  a man of the east. they were the dark skinned races of middle earth. the easterlings sided with the evil morgoth and sauron.
fun fact numenoreans and their direct descendants did not grow a beard even in old age. i think that was tolkiens way of communicating that they had elvish blood in their veins.
sad thing is wokeness won t be done until everything is destroyed to only rise up from the ashes after we re all dead
these people are just determined to ruin and change everything aren t they....tis a world of madness  and in this mad world where we can identify as whatever we want  i now identify as a bloody spaceship and i am about to fly off this crazy blue rock.although i m glad we still have sane  awesome humans like melonie.much love and respect
i remember my grandma telling me  i don t care what they tell you in school  aragorn was black.
great overview and analysis on this. fun how you drifted from the meme dump into a serious analysis. also  cool american flag shirt.
oh yeah we ve never seen something like this before happy monday. have a good memorial day.
i want a black gollum.
wokies   i just wanna spread awareness and acceptance by turning picks random name from a hat black female gay trans  it s very special to me that specificly quickly reads name again gets changed like that.
wizards of the coast is owned by hasbro  and the big investors in hasbro is blackrock and vanguard  2 of the biggest pushers of esg  so expect more of this crap.
hey it works
it s all good. last time you did that turned out pretty good  too.
it s too perfect
it s good.
you gotta keep it! also  i laughed so dang hard when you said  i could just sense the soy!
@moktack  it is
@booming bob  tis.
@moktack  tis
so   we was kangz   is it   well then  have all the kangs in the waaaaaarrrrrlllld!
it works because the video is quite funny.
ouch  that stings!
yikes!
well stated!
wasn t he in the background of someone else s card  or at least small on the card.
i know i already heard it  probably nerdrotic
@wyatt tyson  i believe it was a picture someone took of a card they dug out of the trash at the company. or something like that.
haha i know  i saw this months ago and couldn t believe no one cared to cover it  then suddenly 5 min ago  it s all over youtube
i saw a preview card with him and arwen. it was pretty generic with aragon just darkened.
@wyatt tyson  it was a card where he was standing together with arwen.
@christopher thibeault  lol
kinda gives a whole new meaning to  i can avoid being seen if i wish  but.
cool poster. i see will smith is playing aragembe and morgan freeman is gandalf the black. i don t recognize the actor playing freeroy baggins  though. all in all  it s solid. i m definitely looking forward to lord of the bling.
sometimes less is more.
stunning   brave
boom!
great video  melonie mac go boom fiction race swapping no no no!
it s so good that i genuinely thought you uploaded it on purpose  o
tolkien is going to come back as a dragon and coat us all in hellfire
lol omg good fubu reference
we wuz kangz
i morbed so hard when i saw this
the struggle is real...
it s seriously hilarious how stupid and predictable the entire entertainment industry has become.people used to joke about how they ll probably make a straight character gay or a white character black  but those jokes came true time after time to where they re no longer jokes but accurate predictions.
calm down jamal don t pull out the nine
missed opportunity
they already have a brown maybe evey thought that was too far
saruman of many colours is in the lore
@melonie mac go boom   no  he is gandalf the gay.
@lancer737  of many colors
he s chinese
at least black gandalf would have been recognizable. hard to screw up the robes and pointy hat.
wotc made gandalf chinese. because fireworks or something  idk.
@harbl99  lol. of course! otherwise it would be cultural appropriation.oh sheet! now i m thinking like they do.
gandalf the gay
that version he will be korean.
black aragorn just how tolkien envisioned him.if that s false tolkien is racist.
@cerberus09  and he ll identify as a woman.
@cerberus09  different race and actor every episode
marjorie taylor green would never do that.
i thought i was having a d j  vu or maybe mandela effect
it s the 3rd time they had black aragorn
@spear shaker  i chalk it up to  late to the party . i just rolled my eyes and sighed  of course they did.   when it happened. good to hear melonie s opinion on this though.
third time they made him african  why not mexican or inuit
0
@theangrygoblin  with his hammer smashing fruit
lol good one
more cards has been leaked. that card in the video is new.
to nitpick  i d say southron or haradrim. i always imagined the easterlings as more like huns  magyars and pechneghs rather than middleeastern or far-east asian
and it s specified in the appendices that all numenoreans were fair of skin... dark skinned people only in harad and far harad.but nowadays lore doesn t matter anymore more. only woke ideologies and ethnic obsession.
@camilo fonseca       which always has me asking  if you want dark characters  why not make a mc that is haradrim  i would rather a totally new character that matches the lore of the world be introduced  than altering written characters.
nah  i m pretty sure it is peaking about now with the collapse of film making and entertainment in general including sports.  people are walking away.  i loved nfl for decades but i won t even bother to watch a game nowadays.  the nfl has tainted themselves with criminals in their ranks not to mention about a hundred commercials per game.  it s garbage now like most things coming across our tv sets which i don t even bother to turn on any longer.
@scottw  peaking  hasbara is in total  full effect. cultural subversion has never been so easy.
@elizabeth webbgouen  hollywood ticket sales are down 50  since 2019.  about 8 million people per year are quitting cable in the us.  the entertainment industry including entertainment news is their center of gravity.  we re winning.
the problem is that we can t identify as whatever we want  only what they tell us is okay. i mean  an indiana councilman recently decided to identify as a black woman  and he wasn t accepted for that. no inclusion was given to him. instead  he was insulted for it. seriously  if you re white and identify as a black person and paint yourself black  you ll be hated for that. but of course  a man can identify as a woman  paint his face with make-up  and get a boob job  and he ll be instantly accepted because a small minority of people say that is what s okay. it s all just so stupid.i once heard someone say that earth is the insane asylum of the universe. i feel like that s very much true.

also said little mermaid is black with red hair. so much for recessive genes and genetic theorems
cool american flag shirt  because the u.s. code means as little as the constitution.
yeah that top is
0  she did this to honor the troops  man
no. native.
gangsta gollum xd
im here still waiting for the remake of roots with an all white cast
happy memorial day  melonie. love the flag shirt. you look beautiful today
well aaragorn doesn t really have a father figure in his life so it makes perfect sense to make him black now.  but joking aside  great video today melonie! have a happy memorial day. love your shirt too. you look amazing!
and for those who still get it wrong  it s aragorn with a soft a  not erragon with the hard -er
omg this was the one i was waiting for. i said 10 years ago if they do an aragorn race swap  we ve reached the end  o
first rings of power  then the gollum game and now this. poor tolkien fans. they deserve so much better.
6 26 melonie bout to start turning into she-hulk any minute.
yes  aragorn is a half elf  or something close to it. the numenoreans are descended from elrond s brother. technically  elrond and his brother are the actual half elves  and as such were given the choice to tie their fate to that of either the men or the elves. elrond chose elves  and gained their immortality and other factors  his brother chose men  and became the longest lived human in history  and passed on his longevity to his descendants. case in point  aragorn is probably one of the oldest human characters we meet in the story  because he s over eighty years old when the story takes place.
david leavitt is the hecking toothbrush guy. he made target tori famous  lol
love the tank! hope you re enjoying your memorial day!
i love melonie s creative ideas...look like the character!
the book specifically describes aragorn. dark hair  pale skin  gray eyes.
what s going around now is a new card from the same crossover set. the make aragorn black reaction you are remembering is from the 1st sneak peak where they revealed the actual aragorn card with him being black back around february. so no your not going crazy lol.
i thought they had announced this months ago  but it is actually being released in the coming days
couldn t even have him doing some kind of action  i don t get it. hope you  and your family have a good memorial day melonie. god bless you.
all i m going to say is happy memorial day everyone       and god bless
aragorn takes a look at his friends before charging into battle.... for nike
so stunning and brave. the part where aragorn said   why are all these mother fucking snakes on this mother fucking plane !   literal chills.
i m getting real tired of this crap i m tired of them race swapping characters when will it stop
glad you re on this melonie  thanks for being a voice of reason.
be careful now racist jokes aren t allowed lol don t wanna offend anyone
not every black man has a missing father. you have fallen into the mindset they want you to be in. ever listen to tk  if you try to appeal to someone s sensibilities enough and force something on you  a person s mentality generally tends to go the opposite way... feel me  you re being played like a fiddle and it s so incredibly sad. racism isn t the way bud.
@justin lingle  seganerd1991   yeah wouldn t want that.
c what i mean
@andrew robb  i think u already triggered someone in the comments
@justin lingle  seganerd1991   i can see that. lmao!
not to nitpick but the  happy  memorial day posts are already getting to me knowing that it s a day of remembrance for deceased service members. happy is kind of an oxymoron for this holiday and does not apply.
what would your father say if he knew you gave melonie mac almost  3000 so far this year
it is a nice shirt  it suits her nicely with her long wavy brown hair.
@jim lahey  it s just a joke. dave chapelle   chris rock would ve said the same thing. some folk would laugh due to preconceive prejudice  but most others would laugh due to the truth of the statement   how it needs to be fixed. even bill cosby has commented about the lack of father figures within his community. it s better to laugh rather than shrug your shoulders   act like it s a non issue.
what would your father say if he knew you have given nearly  3000 to melonie so far this year
facts hurt.
@max master j  theyre black though  genius.... him saying it is just tacky and racist. are you really not able to make that separation
david is angling to have a m tg card created in his honour.  they re calling it  soy elemental .
thanks for that  i had a similar reaction to melonie  thought this was old news.
what s so happy about a day for mourning fallen service members
@chuck e cheese ranch  it s not mourning  it s appreciation.
haha! dude wtf
there actually was a card that made aragorn black before. about a month ago  i want to say  still surprised they are doubling down on this.
im gona be as inclusive as ariana grande
people really don t understand the importance of character recognition. nothing about this says aragorn. you look at black ariel and can tell it s ariel. black tinkerbell is still recognizable as tinkerbell. brandy as cinderella is still obviously cinderella. but black aragorn  if i didn t know who it was supposed to be  i d assume he was just dome generic character in a fantasy story. i think most people automatically think of movie aragorn  but in the book he s described as pale  stern  and gray eyed  the exact opposite of what s portrayed here. if you re gonna race swap  at least make the character somewhat recognizable so that anyone who looks at black aragorn will know who he s meant to be.
evil cannot create anything new. it can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made. - j.r.r tolkeinhow right he was.
send the pinkertons after whoever in wotc thought this was a good idea
people read fantasy to escape from grim everyday reality. they don t necessarily want the world they escape into to reflect what they see around them in the real world.
thelarion  banished knight of south saradon. after failing to protect the princess from an assassin from the north  the king banished thelarion from the kingdom. now he wanders the continent as a mercenary without hope of regaining his fallen valor. boom. totally original black character. where s my money
so stunning and brave
what if.... aragorn has always been black     mandela effect intensifies
i remember a few months ago seeing something like this on a mtg card posted online.
apparently i m a bigot. thank you  for wearing the flag on memorial day. you look  amazing  if i may say. why do people make thing about things that they hate.   have a great day  god bless.
a bad actor gamer  nerd culture infiltrator  and politically obsessed with trump even after he s mostly been out of the picture for few years. that s a modern journalist all he way.
melanie how dare you suggest something outrageous as wanting characters looking like themselves
tolkien would be ashamed
your hair looks extra colorful in the video today. there s flat color  extra dyed color  and then today which is like what you would see when you first pull up to clearwater beach and the white sand shimmer makes everything pop out at you more than you expected
great touch on the red white and blue today melonie hope it was a good memorial day for you and those who served for our nation!
what crossover would you most like to see
kinda did happen before and youngrippa59 commented on that one a couple of months agoalso  the  just take the cheque  moment made me think of kobe s quick buck at sony s e3 playstation 3 showcasing.  that ain t realistic at all  just about sums it up!great video as always  melonie mac! go boom!
the number of twitter simps defending it is insane.
there s a reason i went from owning multiple modern decks and keeping up with standard to owning an old jund deck and uninstalling arena. you can t just shit on my childhood forever wotc
the second transracial celebrity to pave the way after michael jackson
no raceswap what so ever is okay
@j luck  agreed  but my point is if they feel like they have to  at least make the character recognizable.
nothing  magic sucks
these are new cards
the thing that irks me is that the artist didn t even bother to tie this to lotr in any way  even the script on sword should at least be tengwar instead of just random nordic runes. i would not be surprised if wizards of the coast just grabbed some pre-existing art piece and said  close enough.
magisimps will still buy the phuk out of it though. even though they complain. either close your wallet or shut up.
i hate how they destroy beloved characters. nothing wrong with trying something wrong  but they do it for obvious reasons. forcing their ideology on others. i hate how they take things people love  corrupt them with their ideology  and hope  it will people make love their ideology. and they do it over and over again. they don t learn  that it doesn t work. they don t learn it just annoyes people and makes them oppose their ideology. they just continue. keep doing it. totally insane. they will do it  until nothing is left. amazon has money  disney has k. kennedy and a lot of properties  twitter has a new  woke ceo  and netflix now tries to rewrite history. sickening
neven seen ms. mac have so much fun on a video ... until now.
oh man you gotta give the books a shot. they are 10x better than the movies!
so are aragorn and heimdall the same person
they used to say   no new is bad news.     i think they might me rethinking that.
i actually don t mind the art. i think it has a nice contemplative quality to it and the sword design is interesting. if this was some random new character i d have thought it was cool and fine. the fact that it is meant to be aragorn  however  is hideous.
mtg is literally pulling the  race card   lol.
yeah  they did  this before with the cards. it  even upset    fans  who  go  out  of  to  stay  neutral.
my brothers and i laughed at it. it s not that big of a deal to us  but clearly it was done to troll the people who do take it super seriously.
why are they doing this  aragorn wasn t even ginger.
do you even play magic  all of the magic players i know are super excited about this collab. it genuinely feels like people that aren t involved in stuff just pick up random parts of it to get mad about. it s just art bro  it s really not that deep
i m so tired bros... so so tired...
slowest clap of the third era incoming
i would make it illegal to change original properties without the original writer and or creators specific permissions. i think if you sell the rights to your intellectual property or entertainment business  there should be huge contracts that restrict the alteration of classics that have already been created. i think remakes should be shot-by-shot and i think race-swapping should be frowned upon  by everyone. it is totally possible to make cool characters of any race  just make new things.
i read the lord of the rings multiple times. there is so much more than in the movies. why can t these people just read the books before they change things! maybe the orcs will be race swapped to. but what do i know. i am just a fan
in the 1970s animated adaptation by ralph bakshi of return of the king  aragorn or strider looked like an american indian and no one really gave a shit.
we wuz kangz n shiiiiiiiiiii...iiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeet!!!11!!!!!!!
i m just waiting for all the amazing memes this nonsense is going to spawn xd
yes  particularly the opening part concerning eru  the valar and maiar.might sound kind of familiar.
they re probablt being extra vindicative for rings of power being rejected.
if it s  just art   why does it need to be associated with a high-profile  well-known existing character that bears no resemblance
@chaosinfusion  it s a collaboration with lord of the rings  of course they re using content from lord of the rings
it s not in response to anything disney.  this commander set has been in the works for a long time now.  that s not to say that it isn t hideous  it is.  it s just another example on the mountain of examples that the left has 0 creativity.  the last set was fairly fun but i m moving on to a different game though.  i ve long since grown tired of turning my hobbies into some social political battle ground.
this isn t right  they should ve made him an muslim woman. jk
i m honestly surprised that so many people found out about this just now
the crossover is so hot that aragorn got toasted
the artwork is really good. they could have done really well with this if they d just made an original black character. i guess that black characters can t earn for themselves though  to be successful they have to appropriate from a white character. who is the racist one again
when i saw this advertised  i assumed it was an artifact type card for the sword  and the image was just an elf bringing the sword to aragorn. oof. this sucks.
aragon isn t black. how do i know this  hint  i read the actual book...
if you have a problem with blaragorn  then you re a rahcicist!!!
aragorn will always be white.
return of the kang  yas qween!
black aragorn aside because  everything easily to us and f    everyone else   that sword is awful.
soon enough  we re gonna get a black lotr show or movie. just wait
tolkien was an awesome christian and more specifically  a proud catholic. sad to see his works put through the new black rock and vanguard social agenda requirements.
these companies need to stop with the pandering already. aren t black people insulted by this  i know i d be if i was black.
ok ok  imagine this  in the new woke version it s gandalf the they and when he comes back to save everyone he s gandalf the them.
i think there was a magic the gathering card that had aragon  and i think his elf girlfriend too   and he was black. probably the de ja vu you were talking about.
wait  wasn t lord of the rings basically a mythical tale for ancient england  . i dont reckon there was black dudes
they had   aragorn and arwen  wed  that was first to feature this  reimagining  of the character.
cool tomb raider statue.
they pick the wrong franchise  should make conan barbarian universe which more diverse
the sword was the best part of the pic.
plenty are but they are shunned in many circles.
saw the name david leavitt and had a wild nostalgia trip. that was the same guy who moments after a bomb ripped children to shreds in manchester  he tweeted the following  multiple confirmed fatalities at manchester arena. the last time i listened to ariana grande i almost died too. make sure to remind him of this whenever he takes the time to do some moral grandstanding.
what s next. are they going to make blade  white
bottom line by this point  these race-swaps are low-effort garbage.  has there been one that even haters can point to and say   yeah  i wasn t happy with the tokenism but at least the production was solid    same thing with this little mermaid storm in a teacup  i hear  we re doing a live action cg remake of an animated movie that checked all the boxes  and i go   that sounds like a waste of time.   before you even get into the race-swapping  it s a no account idea that was never going to best the original.  the fact that disney was cynical enough to then throw in a race swap to deflect from how crap the final product was is kinda beyond the pale.  ditto here.
who approved of this   why  no matter what they do  no matter how hard they try  they re not gonna buy nor support any of these things
sooooo aragorn is an easterling now !
9 20 notice how the levity subsides   fine line  melonie
wtf    rotr is now woke!!  ! so dumb
i almost bought a new deck for hoots  but yikes. can t reward that bravery.
when will this nonsense stop ..
the word  journalist  updated for a modern audience means  dispenser of propaganda.
the original is always best!!
ha ha you re triggered
at this point i want someone to produce a film series that white-washes historically prominent black figures just to see if the woke likes it when it s done the other way around.
there are dark skin races in that universe. why do they always ignore the lore  why always blackface characters
5 03 love this melonie moment
starting with a boom today!   no filler openers here
why destroy a classic story   makes no sense.
so in this new timeline aragorn s mother  gilraen  cheated on arathorn ii like there was no tomorrow    cause you know  there s something different in this new aragorn...
he appears to be experiencing a sort of pensive stoic awareness of his blackness
yeah .. apparently i m a racist. gandalf described him as dark in the book. not black. dark meaning dark haired  scruffy  but not african. but for some reason i almost got banned from a discord server because i said that this wasn t book accurate. that is all. sad. the game is fun  in the end his character could be whatever color. i don t really care. i even defended the decision. their best defense was the it was officially licensed  so it must be accurate. but.. the people that license it out didn t write it  and don t care... therefor that means nothing. i really wish they didn t feel like they had to change the straight  white  male  into anything. but at least they didn t make frodo trans....
don t give them ideas  man. they ll make spawn white too. lmfao
ryan gosling black panther

@norman readdis  figures
not your generation but unfortunately many younger people are all in.
whoever runs magic the gathering is a massive.. massive.... massive   assmeal deluxe with cheese.
who s the black dude with the sword
cant wait for the remake of friday with a white cast!
wb an asian legolas  lol
why can t we have more original stories with original characters now  instead of sloppy seconds  what about stories based on african mythology  we need more good storytelling and passion for it as well. because these people doing race swaps are the furthest thing from passionate.
if they were so desperate for more  diverse  cards in the set  why didn t they just use baranor from shadow of war  that was an already-black character who not only had his own dlc adventure all to himself  but did the entire thing without any supernatural powers whatsoever. why does  more representation  always require taking away white characters
should have been  lort of da rangz  returnt of da kang
tolkien created lotr to be a mythology for britain.
yo the vid thumbnail
aragorn is the first black white man ever it is so amazing...so brave.....finally people who only thinks about color all their lives will feel better about this hero....he wasn t a real hero yet...now that he is black he is a real hero...the savior of the woke world.
so stunning much brave
i m not purchasing anything from this set bc of this stupid bullshit
they bastardised this franchise.  sighs  i miss christopher.aside of the books  this are the other medias that we should only take care about . the lord of the rings  the fellowship of the ring. the lord of the rings  the two towers. the lord of the rings  the return of the king. m4 s the hobbit book edit. the lord of the rings  the two towers  game . the lord of the rings  the return of the king  game . the lord of the rings  the third age. the lord of the rings  conquestman  i somehow miss that era where games tried to look realistic  but they didn t and still have charm. idk how to explain it.
beyond ridiculous i m seriously fed up of this woke nonsense. no respect for other cultures .lotr is based on england . the creatures are from germanic norse  old english folklore.
if tolkien were around today id assume hed be a left winger apologizing for his past work and rewriting it this way anyway.
love the top!
i wish someone does like a white version of blade or smh  to see what these woke people has to say then xd
not every character can be morgan freeman as god. make new characters not giving them hand-me-downs.
the lead actor in lord of the rings is jewish. so they race sealed him. clearly these guys can t be racist as they say we are right let that sarcasm sink in a moment for the truth to surface.
okay folks the response is incredibly simple  throw out all your mtg cards. don t ever buy so much as a post card from wizards of the coast.
why do you think that
@hello  idk just a hunch.
counterfeit aragorn looks as tired and bored of wizards of the woke as the rest of us.
is that wesley snipes
its like in modern movies production they just read the first few pages or a leaflet. they see a random character and think  oh yes  this has gotta be aragorn  this is gimli and there is this elf  or something . just like star wars. what does sw need- ah obviously lightsabers!
where did this weak video come from
nice calling out the mid creepers melma. az from hvb was also calling the soy cuckery of one o the lotr proffessors on his channel. dont let predatory mediocrity slide. also love the grey flag shirt on your happy daddys still with us day. my close calls with rgps alone im always releived my spaztard self managed to survive. if i didnt though i can say however u celebrate  do it because u can and dont let anyone pull u down for it.
i still have my extended edition blu ray box set of the original trilogy and there s nothing amazon or magic can do about it.
that shirt is wicked.... oh yeah  and eff the swap. wtf. i m an artist  i paint landscape and wildlife. i have an level of integrity. i would never take a commission that i didnt believe in. whoever did this needs to take a look in the mirror.
what really kills me  is that he s the only character they race-swapped. if you re going to change something for literally no reason  and that also blatantly betrays tolkien s whole purpose for his works  creating an anglo-saxon mythos for the creation of the english language    why stop at only one race swap  it boggles the mind.
dunedain  dune-eh-dine
i had an argument the other day about whether race swapping fictional characters for live action adaptation  like movies  was bad in of itself. yes it would mess the books up. they probably weren t thinking of black when they said  fair and beautiful  or whatever. yet race shouldn t matter that much. generally i don t think it s a good thing to do  because it subverts the readers  expectations
wait until laura is reimagined as a black urban youth with an insatiable thirst for obscure polynesian lore and relics.
this is the guy who has to work in customer service to pay his bills and constantly tries to get ordinary people fired !!!
why not race swap him with a dwarf  or an orc  they need representation too
big fan of lord of the rings.  i was going to buy tons of these cards but now i am done with all mtg.  so sick of the woke agendas trying to change things.
lets drum up controversy so at least people are talking about us.   seems like a good signifier of a brand in decline.
is that jimi hendrix
wotc had a card released a few months back where aragorn is black on it and got rightfully roasted. mtg hasn t been the great tcg it once was for a very long time and just a mess of whatever ips they can cram in it as they make the cards more and more needlessly complex  gearing everything now towards commander  not real magic but can be a fun diversion   and having the characters look like some rando doing generic high fantasy cosplay. remember when mtg was put in the same category as marilyn manson  doom  mortal kombat  etc as corrupting the youth of the nation  i remember and so does pepperidge farm
intro was hillarious
@11 14  all jokes aside   no  the northern rangers are not half elves  but if he has children with his elf wife he gets in the last movie  they will have a large chunk of elf in their dna  along with the beings all the wizards are part of  wizards are not human even if they look like it  they are the equivalent of angels in lotr.idk if tolken was involved with the og animated movie  but aragorn was sorta depicted being  indian american  like.   theirs muitlpile different kind of rangers  i am guessing in the animated movie  maybe they felt it wouldn t confuse viewers if they made people that are  norther rangers  be based on indians in america.
lara
funny  that is melonie s entire brand!
we wuz kangs of numenor!
kang afragorn of the wangs of powah!
them   race shouldn t matter  you racists me   then why did you race swap him
when i get rich  i m making black donald trump  the movie.
the world is going mad... we are going under ppl!
11 51 the painting doesn t look like it has any of them. no black hair or gray eyes.
it was the same withe the reveal of the  aragorn and arwen  wed  card
melanie  you missed a golden opportunity.  and he s got the rainbow  because he s into  butt stuff.
ngl i couldn t even see the guy for a hot second
the american flag has never looked so good
we now need a 6 foot 6 inch tall gimli.
this looks like that awful ai art.
the same company that send the pinkertons after a mtg youtuber
mel- it s pronounced  doon uh d n  and they talk about it in the films lol.
aragorn the fresh vs. saruman the blackest  naz gul renamed to hay durs.
this is fanfic. it doesn t count.
disparu is said dis pour roo
wotc has been tiptoeing down this road for a while now
if i were a mtg fan  i no longer would after this...
another thing i don t have to spend money on.
it s just absolutely trashi would have 100  bought this set to have all of the cool lands and character cards but nvm nowin the card  aragorn and arwen  wedof course they didn t change arwens color because they need to have their interracial couple on displayalso i cant tell but it looks like on  reprieve  they made eowyn black or mixed as well
didn t snl do this
smoke show.
i m not going to boycott magic the gathering. cause i can t. they have never gotta penny off me my entire life. d d won t get any money either. i m pretty sure they went woke to but i don t care to look. i would buy those fancy d20 dice though. but that has little to do with board games. i m just a math nerd.
and of course they left arwen as a young white woman.
legolas should be gay now.
hasbro has been going broke for a while. the faster the better.
is that the flag from ft. mchenry
yeah... they did this a few months ago.
i got blocked by wotc today for commenting about his color. i took screenshots of my comments before i was blocked as proof of what i posted. no insults  bad words  threats or racist remarks were made. i just got silenced because they didn t agree with what i said and because i pulled the uno reverse card on them.
love that shirt on you melonie  e
i don t know about you brother and sisters but we need a movie of the white zulu warrior kings triumph over the black tyrannical suppressors. no longer will they blackwash non existent films. also documentary dramas of john henry and george washington carver.
i m like you   did this happenings before    there could have been a  fan  who did something like this as some kind of submission.  maybe there was another company that did something similar.  but what is obvious is magic the gathering has fallen off for sometime now  for this is a horrible cash grab.
well someone had too much fun with this video. good. remember to drink water.everyone have a wonderful day.
in the lotr  books aragorn is described as having pale skin not brown or black.
commenting to feed the algorithm
you would think the companies would learn by now
the wotc business plan 1. piss off fans. 2.    3.    4. lose their shirt.
black aragorn marries black cleopatra and their baby is baby yoda!
magic the what
aragorn to the store for cigarettes and never comin back
where is aragorn seriously
still waiting for the all white wakanda remake.
that s not aragorn. looks nothing like the description tolkien made of him  in a origin mythology story he made of the uk! people need to stop race swapping! fictional or not  it hurts. i m surprised tolkien isn t haunting the people who came up with this idea.
inb4 lara croft is black.
not lotr cannon  cannot be considered as such under any circumstances. they can t claim that some african ended up in gondor and behold! black aragorn! can you image if a game or show came pout with a white blade the half human vampire  i d feel the exact same way  it s not racism like these intersectionalist idiots claim about everything! ! !
i know nothing of mtg but i heard they got in early on all the wokeness.
his sword has what looks like an ineffective handguard.
hey  melonie happy memorial day to you too. also i love your red   white and blue tank shirt and your curly hair looks beautiful and lovely too. anyway i have to say that i don t think it is not right and it is not okay to have a black person for the lord of the rings television show series and movie series too bc i don t even know how many characters in the tv show series that was black and that was great for the movie series too. anyway i just want to say that it is not right thing and good thing to have a black person for the television show series role for lord of the rings series and the movie series when there was no one who was black in the lord of the rings movie series and tv series  ok melonie. anyway that s all i can say about this video for today and i just want to say that i really enjoyed your videos that you make for everyday and i just want to tell you that keep up with good work   i hope you enjoy of doing it too. anyway hope you had a great weekend with your family and i hope you had a great day today and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite and have a great week too melonie. also god bless you too melonie.
show me that artwork  and i wouldn t know what i was looking at unless you told me. just generic black dude in fantasy setting. cool  i guess  oh it s meant to be aragorn
afrogorn took some ambien before his instagram filter pic.
that s 7 months ago
pretty sure that s just a lord of the rings porn parody and not part of tolkien s universe. lol
well of course he is  why wouldn t he go back in time and off the original. you go magic the gathering  way to boost those sales
no matter what tolkien said.my grandma told me aragorn was black.
i was so excited for this set tell i herd their not even staying faithful to the movies  i was pist
my mother told me  no matter what the book says  aragorn was black
the return of the kang funny thing is kang in marvel is black too and he has alot of legal problems right now lol
why do you buy the rights to a character   then remake a brand new character and just cool he the name.  just make the new character.
comment for the algorithm
tolkien must be rolling in his grave
praise the holy black boom
kwasade against the algorithm !!!
i d be willing to bet real money that in magic the gathering... arwen remains white.
and his sword sucks. it looks like she-ra s from the 80 s princes of power cartoon. he-man goons kick his ass for stealing from his sister
hey  he is following me and liked some of my past tweets. video comes home
i think i dropped out of mtg in time.
black numenorean n sheeit
i m jewish... what about it
so you ve heard of the black unicorn ... now hear me out...
no he is not  that s not aragorn.
at least they didnt do frodawg
but he wasn t even a ginger
he ll yeah
you d think that they d leave lord of the rings alone. but nope.
wizard of oz have black verison
it did happen before.
i saw the  lord of the rangs  in the thumbnail. . . . . return of the kang  !  i hear that and it screams to me . . . . .  .mortal kombat. . . . . except liu kang is noticeably absent. . . .
when are these people going to woke-up  color me a bigot.
it is all a conspiracy...
what is next  black lara croft  black tifa  black sailor moon
magic of the woke ! they need to change their name
miles morales aragorn! swag of a middle earth teenager!
maybe we had it all wrong. lotr was filmed in a hood near you dawg
i thought aragorn was a spider.
cant they just create their own stories. do they need to replace all the main characters its kinda rachist. they need a black lady afro gollum hes not very representative.. or even better a drag queen gollum. or they could just take a day off posturing go sit in a dark room write themselves some myths and legends i mean  or theres many centuries of history and stories right. why they really need to hijack everything just because its popular and classic . hollywood on fire theyre just doubling down trying harvest the modern woke creeps with skinsuit mockery. oh its star wars its star trek its lor it must be good right its halo its ninja turtles lol. trying keep the cashcow ips active and relevant to modern sensitive petals. by crapping on problematic relics of their time apparently. single mothers women and children mostly just tend to follow the herd. biggest cashcow they got their eye on the ball. matrix battery farm
oooh lawd dem rangz..also...dem small hats
d  aragorn
rascists  may be my favourite people to read about right now.
4 30 the names makes me think of roots 1977.
it s the double standard that is maddening. take a movie like book of eli or i am legend and remake it with a white protagonist. what s the result  looting  protest  marching the streets! the entitlement is the saddest part.
still no chair melonie
not  dundin  rather  dun - e i  - dain .
honestly that sword is more incorrect than the race lolz.
three black aragorn cards
good for you for bringing this up  but this is kind of old news. that image is probably new  but they did this a month or two ago in a card which paired him with a still white arwen undomniel. a ridiculous combination of  we wuz numenorian kangz!  and  where all da white wimmin elvez at !
where did you get the american tank top
did this happen before  mfw
lawd uv duh rang  reetern uv duh pimp
i m using a standing desk soooooo lol
@melonie mac go boom very fancy
aragorn is even more powerful now because he can call orcs the n word..
kangz of dem rangz
idc  i dislike the race choice for this character. reminds me that of re netflix bs
they are actual cards
i stopped playing this awhile ago  because when they added fortnite as a set  it made me want to play anymore  but after this i will probably never play again.
doon uh dane
does hollywood etc even notice anything from their fans  the  outside world  or do they live in an enclosed bubble inside an alternate reality. i mean the question is  do they even have internet
stunning and brave
man are now bro.the holy bro-kin of middleearth  descendend of the ancient kangz
we was n men reans
why even use the license if you re just going to shit all over it
this is the same guy who harassed that target employee about the price of a electric toothbrush when it was a clear mistake.
well  we know that blacks are well represented in european mythology...insert eye roll here.  i m all for a white kunta kintae in a remake of roots.

not sure when aragorn had rasta hair. the sword looks like something from a budget toy store.
omg he looks cool!
why
yikes . yeah race bending characters is so unnecessary and unneeded.
i liked the part where frodo was chinese and gandalf was a lesbian in a magic wheelchair.
let s all go to target and buy magic cards and go home to play and drink some bud light  any takers
rich people rely and the general population not being able to distinguish the difference between nationality   religion  and if that spell breaks they loose a lot of free money.
dunedain. say it with me  duna-ah-dine.
we wuz d nedain and sheeeeeeeeit
couldn t they at least have him carry an iklwa assegai instead of a boring european... well it s not a long- and it s not a b-st-rd- sword... sword  couldn t his tunic have been leopardskin instead of that moldy greenish jacket
boycott
i dont mind.  since we makin shit up im now a black woman.  now were my reparations
i don t imagine a lot of black people play magic the gathering or like lord of the rings so who is this for
funny it can happen to white characters  but imagine the backlash if black panther was cast as a white man tomorrow .. now i m all for diversity of people playing parts  it s called acting  however when they only make it about one side then it becomes something completely different if you can do it to one character then all are fair game.  seems like it s only diversity if it s not a white person playing the part.  i m portuguese and my kids are half black half portuguese and we laugh about the stupidity of diversity constantly
i thought everybody would be excited. i mean  this is the role idris elba was born to play  right  lotr character who sounds like a tooth-sucking cockney footballer   oi  where s all me magic stuff  then  sometimes a bloke can t keep up wif nuffink.
this is old news. heard about this months ago
magic sucks anyway
love that top!
you don t have to have read the books  pretty sure they say d nedain in the movies. sounded somethin like  d -ne-dyne  if i recall.
turf nation home girl.
it s the fresh prince of beleriand.
you remembered correctly. it was revealed previously. it s now about to launch.i say  who cares. just speak with your wallet.
thanks for the vid you have a blessed soul melonie have a blessed day and blessed life doing what you love and thanks for all you do for us melonie 1 12
...we wuz aragorn
most echoed clip ever.
he was always black  dont forget the 3rd movie   return of the kings   bernie mac was aragorn!!!  how could you make such a mistake     ps i miss bernie mac......
that was for the announcement. it is released now. that s why you hear it again.
is it really diverse if it s always  white to black  they could also just leave it be...
and legolas is a lego now
yeah i remember this so i wasn t surprised.
oh gawds! they better not race swap laura croft..
what s next  gandalf the prismatic jouncing hobbits on his lap with a merry twinkle in his eye
africa is a massive continent with almost countless cultures...can we get some of their stories please   why blackwash european stories when sooooooo much new content  literally a continents worth  is untapped ! !
brave
they are not basing it on the movie and they are not basing it on the book  who are they targeting other then hard-core mtg gamer and reseller  their no wider audience for this product.
i just found out about this from jeremy from the quartering what s next amber heard s going to be storm in the new x-men movie lol
didn t know there s a continuation of lotr in wakanda
return of the kank  finally
respectfully he was originally meant to be black
did they not learn from last time and which fandom they are messing with happy memorial day
i saw this coming
honestly i am shocked that this is even true.. i don t understand why ppl continue playing mtg... like every month there is something degenerate they do....
im excited for the new movie biopic about lizzo  starring peter dinklege.
also isn t aragorn supposed to look young and not like a middle to elder looking man which this bastardization looks
weh waz kangs and shiot...got im tired of these people lol.
south park is the reason i know what mtg is
i want donnie yen as blade. stop asian hate.
@adam  i want pedro pascal as black panther!
because you can t divide people that way.
@lee peck  i m not sure what that means.  they are currently divided from us culturally  the west .  i want that to end  so we can experience their stories and learn more about their cultures.  it might offend some folks  but at least it s new!
just like i saw a post with  0 coming
ben stiller and vince vaughn did a mock pitch meeting of a lotr with an all black cast years ago.
happy memorial day melonie mac
lmaooo so brave!
you know many yrs ago madtv did a skit called lord of the bling. it was hilarious
couldn t care less about this. you re falling for the obvious distraction. when are you going to talk about crowder
