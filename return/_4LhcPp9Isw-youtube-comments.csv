t need a transformer to look like me to enjoy the transformers. really good Bible verse melonie. I share that one as a reply to one of your tweets not to long ago. we need to rise together. love the video melonie. still praying for your mother,

just stumbled on your video because the thumbnail reminded me of disparu s  and pulling up Bible gateway got me to sub  haha. looking forward to checking out your previous videos now and I hope your mom is doing well,

I like you your take on the Bible verse. when you first read it  I immediatly thought   damn  the Bible is big on gains  talking about the need for a workout buddy,

I loved the Bible verse at the end,

nice applicable Bible verse insert,

the truly virtuous do not seek recognition or glory  as like the true followers of God will never gloat about their religion. God recognizes your deeds without fanfare as people will acknowledge what you do without the narcissism trumpeting your actions,

I liked the scripture you picked. Im new to your channel and Im watching all your videos. enjoying your work. God bless you
