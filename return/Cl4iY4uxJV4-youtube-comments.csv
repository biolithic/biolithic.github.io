thank you for sharing your faith openly and honestly. as followers of Christ  it is our fate to be persecuted and carry on regardless. prayers for continued strength in your journey. your hair looks fantastic  by the way.

keep going mel! you may be judged by some but you are creating a strong and loyal following on this channel. you helped me return to my faith after many years of forgetfulness. but God never forgot about me. he led me to your channel and now Im building a stronger relationship with him than I ever had before. I  as a fellow Christian cannot thank you enough. never stop booming!

and its nice that you openly declare your faith.

you got this melonie! I cant imagine how hard it would be to have people come after you for religion  nonetheless what your thoughts and feeling are  on different topics. I really enjoy your content  and enjoy and agree with a ton of your thoughts and feelings on character designs  female and male! its really nice and refreshing to actually hear someone talking about the details of characters that make them who they are. Im bit of a stickler for accuracy to there originals  and just good taste I d say myself  so yeah. once again I really enjoy and appreciate your content  thoughts on things  feelings on different topics  and youreading Bible verses  the more we hear the Bible the more things jump out to you and you learn. anyway  praying for you and looking forward to more content. have a great day and night - . go boom!

I love your hair  I love your energy  I love your attitude about your beliefs  I love your faith in God to have your back  but mostly  I love that you are authentic. I saw you with the critical drinker and decided to check out your channel. now I cant get enough.

Im not sure why the algorithm originally suggested your videos to me.  I was shocked when youread a Bible verse at the end of that first video.  so I watched a few more and eventually subscribed.  I really appreciate the openness with your faith.  please keep it up.  as a Christian I wouldn t say Ive strayed from the path necessarily but I definitely sat down and stopped going down that path some time ago.  Ive had this feeling nagging at me for the last couple of years that I have to get back into the Bible and have to get back to church.

Im glad you were able to move on and grow in your faith. youre an inspiration to me. I will keep you in my prayers. God is using you to encourage so many others like me. and dont lose hope!

thank you also for sharing a bit of your faith  its always uplifting.

I backslid know my faith as well and Im know going back to church and getting back to reading my Bible and it feels so great

thank you for putting your faith front and center and being unapologetic about it. God bless!

I love your channel just wanted to say that  love your talks about lara croft and I love that you talk about your faith too  recently Ive been getting back to my faith and actually reading through the Bible.
