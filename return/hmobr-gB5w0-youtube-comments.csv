thanks for the Bible verses to be honest  Im collecting these everyday  really appreciate sharing your faith.

God s promise is true. it never affects us in the way we think  but it is always there.  you just have to put faith in him.

great video. the honesty of admitting your part in dudes not wanting to play video games with girls speaks to your Christian character. God bless you and your loved ones.  

melonie  youre the most awesome person on youtube  as far as Im concerned. your takes on the culture are passionate and yet so levelheaded  and your Bible verse segments are uplifting and so often you give the gospel clearly  which takes a lot of guts!! Im proud of the work youre doing on here  you ve been a huge encouragement to me 

just wanted to say hi! I am not a Christian  but I enjoy your verse of the day. learning a word of God cannot be a bad thing in this world. keep up the great videos and go boom!
