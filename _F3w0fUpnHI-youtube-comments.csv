there s nothing sweeter than seeing power-hungry bullies discovering that people are not as afraid of them as they thought.
you are spot on with  this is becoming a  control  tactic rather than an  awareness  tactic on twitter. keep pushing forward. love is for all humans  always. this behaviour does not come out of love  compassion or kindness  cancelation  calling people names  hate raids etc.
melanie this is the first time in my life i have ever responded to anything online.i spent 17 years as a newspaper reporter  largely socom or u.s. special operations command in tampa  florida.i spent another 9 years as an emt.some of my best friends were green berets or delta.what i have witnessed you do over the past several months is as impressive as anything i covered in my existence.i applaud you for your persistence and guts  which i liken to franklin d. miller  a medal of honor recipient who was my friend.thank you  melanie  for your honor and courage. my prayers will be with you.thank you.george coryell
i don t think it will but i hope this wins so many goty awards.
i was never into harry potter but watching all of you play makes me want to buy it. looks like so much fun
can i just say winning looks good on you  you are simply glowing in this video.i agree with what you said about holding the line. it is one thing to enter their  safe space  and be aggressive. that is their way. it is entirely different to stand your ground when someone goes out of their way to affect you. since they like to say words are violence  the difference between their way and yours is the difference between assault and self-defense.
they just won t let up. keep up the good fight. they ll probably keep attacking on your stream tonight. can t wait to see it. also i love your shirt. looks amazing on you!
hope you have a blast streaming hogwarts legacy again today  and remember  never let any clowns who can t even tell you what a woman is  tell you what games you can or can t play...
there s a difference between seeking revenge and standing your ground. don t let anyone try to conflate the two to take advantage of you.
sounds like the haters need to reparo butthurto.
a modern example of  turn the other cheek  -  just roll with it and dunk on them with memes
i m laughing throughout the whole video but when melonie couldn t say ima biggot without cracking up  i just about fell out of my chair. lol
never stand down and keep silent for what these people do or say  cause in the end they would effect us all and they don t even play video games or love what we love in the first place  good job and keep strong
i just found your channel. i m so pleased to see someone so bold and willing to state their beliefs. this is great. i m a subscriber now.!!!!
love it when you bring in scripture to your videos. and you re right. christians shouldn t be pushovers. jesus commanded us to sell our cloaks and buy swords  after all.  luke 22 36
i ve never been on twitch before  not really my thing - but i created an account just to support you streaming this and pushing back against the haters.  keep doing what you do  and you ll keep getting support from people like me  who are fed up with woke cancel culture and censorship.
tuned into a lot of your stream yesterday and it was a blast! also  enjoying the game myself  too! i hope the wokies stay mad and cry harder. we re just going to keep having a good time!
hi melonie i ve following you for a bit  but this one  helped me out. since ive been struggleing with my faith as a chirstian  and trying to understand the   turn the other cheek ... thanks for bible references. keep it up  your channel is becoming one of my favorits
that was the most fun i had watching a stream  looking forward to your stream right after the nintendo direct.
i can t wait to play the game. i ll start this weekend  once i ve got some free time. and melonie  blue suits you so much. you look gorgeous!
well said
chica!
for real. the amount of women ive seen get attacked for simply being excited for a game is just gross. people should be able to consume and enjoy whatever content they want
those people that claim the game spreads hatred while simultaneously projecting their hatred onto everyone else... i m so glad more rational people have come together and refuse to let them get away with cancelling any little thing they disagree with. entitled brats.
wokeness is all about bullying and power  and it always has been. the mistake is to ever indicate that you care what they think in any way whatever  when they call you names  don t deny it - embrace it and mock them.
sry to inform u but it was always about power tripping for them it didnt just become about control... but yeah i agree on the premise.
it s not even you guys own fanbases doing it  it s people who never  watch you and have no stake in it. from what i ve seen the bubblies are very supportive if you.
even if i enjoy another game better  i wouldn t be mad if this won just for how much it will annoy these people.
i m enjoying the game. it s well made.
depends on this year s release class  my prediction is starfield  but it s definitely reviewed high enough to be nominated for something
it will definitely win the fans goty award
i m not holding my breath on that one.  i could see nominations  but no way a woke awards show is going to even consider giving it goty.
the game uses characters from lore such as phineas nigellus black  sirius  great  great grandfather who was the headteacher. they actually respect the lore whilst also doing their own thing. they could have been lazy  velma show  but they put a lot in it. no bugs or glitches as far as i can see. a  lot of hyped up games have bugs and stuff at the beginning. this game has stuff that most fans wanted since the beginning such as choosing houses  flying freely etc. i would be surprised if it did not get the top awards. they also delayed the game instead of rushing out an inferior game.
it s great! i love the exploration aspect of the game.
the combat reminds me a bit of dragon s dogma and force awakens.  the woke see enemies everywhere  they should be more tolerant of others.
not that i dont agree..but its the monitor light cast lol
they say words are violence  then terrorise any woman who says no....sounds like they gaslight to me. who does that again  oh yeah  narcissists.
hey man  i like your profile pic - keep up the grind!
they are unimportant lol
this comment was just to praise her shirt
have fun playing your game about trans poc wizards and children practicing black magic. this is reverse psychology 101.
@auto1nfanticid3  it s a game dude  unlike the star wars drag nonsense. that s called grooming. pretty sure that s more damaging.
@batman0  and drag is just dancing. you think this is an actual argument  try again.
@batman0  im not deleting anything  that is youtube censorship. when did i come out in support of star wars drag shows  my point was that you arent making a point  you cited one bad thing and sad hogwart s legacy isnt as bad. that doesnt counter anything i said  and in fact you are the one cherry picking.
@auto1nfanticid3  i thought the reason people were pissed is because they didn t include trans characters  and that jk rolling refused to say  trans women are women  good for her because they aren t.
@batman0  ok  so would you use the same defense if the game was ru paul s drag race  the videogame  for children 8 and up  its just a game right  nothing harmful can come of it. saying something is just a game is a non argument  entertainment is how they indoctrinate
@mcmahonhater  the game does include gay and trans characters. the outrage is about her tweets. thehp franchise is still part of the alphabet mafia.
bahahaha yes!
@meloniemacgoboom  judging by the numbers twitch made there s a lot of that going around.
zing hahah
seethus dilatus!
instead they ve cast meatus deletus.
@auto1nfanticid3  i don t care.
@mcmahonhater   you dont care that you are incorrect  ignorance is bliss i guess.
@auto1nfanticid3  if you don t like the game don t buy the game  don t tell other people how to spend their money. i opposed thor love and thunder because it featured a scene that mocked male victims of sexual assault. all i said was  i m boyotting this film because...  and people attacked me. if you don t agree with the games politics then spend your money on something else.
@mcmahonhater  i havent told anyone how to spend their money. i m merely pointing out that if they are purchasing the game as an anti-woke statement that they are misinformed and misled.
@auto1nfanticid3  i don t think so  i think you re a troll trying to pull a reverse psychology deal.
yes!
the sound of meme canons firing will never cease
i would love to see more companies take a shot at background story telling similar to how fromsoft does it
it is a really well made game to. really brings to life the world and plays really smooth to. i have only played a little of it so far but i am very impressed by it so far. it is going to be very hard for other games to beat this for game of the year this year.
had a great time watching your stream yesterday. chat was crazy   also  wow  you look gorgeous today.
don t let the weirdos control what you can play  enjoy games you love and don t let anyone stop you  period
i love this game so far.  the attention to detail is a dream come true after playing chamber of secrets on ps2. i named my character will triggerwokes in their honor.
i watched a hardcore hp fan stream it on youtube to 6k  people for a couple hours with chat enabled and never saw any cry bullies.  i was a little bit surprised.  i m not a huge hp fan  but i ve seen the movies and read the first book  which i liked .  what i saw from the stream convinced me to buy the game.  i thought it looked great.
ima biggit  really messed me up .stream was fun and the people in chat were cool.  trolls couldn t survive there because no one really cared about them  lol.you said in this video that you lost 90  of your circle back when they first started canceling you.  have any of those people ever tried to reach out and say they were sorry if so  would they be willing to talk with you about things interview style on camera  or anonymously keeping themselves hidden  with a voice changer   could be really interesting if they were willing to talk.  it always boggles my mind how that mindset works or doesn t work  i guess  i don t know  haha .
keep saying the truth. just found your channel and i love it
i think my favourite part of that stream was the occasional person singing in just to call everyone a bigot  and someone else would donate them a sub. that never got old.also probably the longest time i ve spent watching a stream for a game i m planning on playing  instead of just watching to see if it s worth playing.
even vtubers are being harassed. pikamee ended her stream early cause of the bullying
rash with the gift subscription moment was among the funniest things i ve seen  lol.
there is nothing that hurts a cause more then people telling you what you have to say  what you have to think  and what you can play. melonie mac go boom!
never been a fan of anything harry potter  but after playing this game on early access  i can say that it s pretty good. goty material for sure.
it was a fun stream  just watched until you reached the part in the game i had gotten to earlier    i m in slytherin and i m gonna be the nicest slytherin ever  but i might use avada kedavra when i find the spell  here and there for fun  d
played 5 hrs. the conversations  voice acting  overall detail of the world feels so detailed. well not on rdr2 level but still very good.
been a fan  been watching mac for about 10 years. never back down. never let then tell you what you can not say.
10 points to hufflepuff for the glorious name.
they act like 5yr olds callling people names thinking you re gonna get offended lmao little they know in the 90 s bullying was hardcore bro
i love the character name. that was so funny. such a fun time yesterday melonie. looking forward to the next. stay cool my friend.
watched your stream from beginning to end yesterday  can t wait for more!
thanks! appreciate how much everyone enjoyed my jab!
dude seriously lol. bullying got soft after the 90 s.
also bring back the british scottish accents
always spamming comments
hope your chat was not too bad on twitch. i spent the better part of a stream having to ban the loonies from a chat i moderate. after the crazies were purged it was smooth sailing. but got around 150 bot accounts banned
it was a beautiful thing to behold.  and i d watch you stream  but i ve playing it myself.  and to think i would have passed on it if it weren t for their constant harping about it...  some serious irony in that...
we need more of this  throw it back in their faces.  laugh at them  shrug off every insult or label they try to place on you  make them irrelevant.
that s awesome! i was watching some people on twitch  wish i knew you were with how much fun you had. i ll have to check you out sometime.
we out here having fun. i streamed yesterday and we had a blast. i m loving all of this. they can t handle it and every time they tried to come in and post spoilers on my posts i would just make fun of them and block them xd
gamer w moment.  drinking tears are almost as fun as drinking their milkshakes.   if you have a milkshake  and i have a milkshake  and i have a straw. there it is  it s a straw  you see  watch it. now my straw reaches across the room and starts to drink your milkshake. i... drink... your... milkshake. i drink it up!
i d like to join  in with the stream  i ve heard so many amazing things of hogwarts legacy.
we all knew this was going to happen.  ..i m still believing that they did this on purpose
there you are playing your harry potter game  and all of a sudden  you re a slytherin. you didn t ask for this  you didn t choose this  but there it is  and it s treated no differently than playing a griffindor.
this is a win for all of us mel  but don t let it go to your head.we still need to win this war. stay vigilant   remain focused  savvy
the quality of this game has just exposed all of access media  once again  for being pathetically cowardly in refusing to review and fairly score this game!
melanie you make my heart go boom!
they kinda deserve the outcome though  not sure why these folks think that people will bend the knee and not play a video game...   it s good the game is huge  the devs deserve it.
hogwarts legacy wins!i m playing the game now. great to see the twitch record.
the best thumbnail ever lol well done  melonie!! haha
hey girl keep up the good work these people have no life s and to boycott a video is just crap. you do what you do and screw those people. also you look very beautiful today.
i love that this is happening!! especially when i see their meltdowns when i post the receipt for my preorder
wow melonie i absolutely  your outfit tonight.it s always fantastic seeing you getting hyping up of joy explaining yourprogets u discovered i really enjoyed the game.takecare melonie
the  go boom  era is quickly becoming my favourite! i ve been here for a long while.
many players have chosen to boycott the game  who is dexerto kidding   players   the real players are having fun playing the game  not crying and screaming like deranged idiots. i ve only seen you and az play on stream and both seem to be having a brilliant time with the game. looks quite fun and a nice breath of fresh air so to speak. anyone saying christians are passive have probably gained that idea from watching the flanders family on the simpsons  just ignorant! but they can never stop the biggit army. their cries only make the army bigger and stronger
i mean  if you re a pureblood you better choose slytherin.
how is it a win  we re been tricked into endorsing a game that promotes gay and trans wizards  and black magic for children.
@rahldraconis708  yeah its just a videogame  it isnt a multigenerational war on western values. do you think this is just a gaming channel and not one that attempts to focus on the culture war
@auto1nfanticid3  they used the uno reverse card xd.
@navigator590  yeah its pretty insane how easily people are duped.
haha thank you!
@tmacgamer  who is coping  im merely pointing out that you and a bunch of other people got tricked into supporting wokeness and still dont even realize it.
you are an inspiration. twitter sucks right now
i just want you to know  you look super cute in this video! you have yourself a beautiful day and keep promoting that love   spread that info!! much love folks!! fun fact  wife and i just got our ps5 this past weekend and those are the single two games we have installed  cyberpunk 2077 and hogwarts legacy.  yes m  it is just the deluxe and collectors edition folks who have it in their hands at this point.
your character name rocks! lol   this whole situation is so darn funny !
you re great  melonie!
i remember the story of how jesus passively went into the temple and started passively flipping tables
looking forward to see what ima does next!
this should send a message to all gaming devs and twitch streamers that these woke loons don t have the power or the majority that they would like everyone to believe. there is much greater success in ignoring them than catering to them. there is no way that these record-breaking numbers would have been hit if that wasn t the case.sadly  it seems likely that few will listen.
i nearly passed away when i saw ima pop up on my twatter feed! she is glorious!!!!!!! oh dear  i assumed her gender....oops!!!!!!!!!!! my copy is now in the post and i am hyped to play as my wizard....need to think of a good name for him!!! i love story and good game play so i think i will avoid the morons!!!! i refuse to let these brainless tools stop me from playing a game  i need to roll with the  punches
the people refusing to stream it might consider what s happening to gaming journalists and why. i mean  if it s not some streamer s preferred kind of game  that s fine. but if they re going to boycott it and other games for politics they might end up in the same boat as kotaku.
lol  ima biggit should be the name of all future characters! and you are right  wearing the labels they give us in defiance of them  gives them no power.
love it well played
you re great  melanie!
2 39 we are all fans of this character.
happy wednesday melonie mac! enjoyed you on the mario kart stream this past monday with dan vasc  rippa  lady rippa and g g! please return to mario kart again with g g  dan vasc  rippa and lady rippa pls!
reality is definitely the word.
i bet some of them yelled at their friends not to play it... but are probably playing it themselves
i absolutely love this game! honestly as a gay man i think the whole thing is ridiculous. yes i m not trans but being in this community  it really angers me that people will tell me i m a gay man who is transphobic and i m like no i m just a guy who likes to game. honesty i looked up what jk rowling said and i didn t find it to be transphobic honestly. why can t we all just enjoy a game without this bs. it s entertainment  plain and simple. love your videos btw.
meme on them until they cry  then make memes of them crying.
i have to wait till friday to get the game but cant wait to play it looks really good from what i have seen so far
funny how  when bad people make up slurs for good people  good people take the name as a point of pride.
can t wait until it releases in 2 more days.
this whole thing is just funny.  so funny.
one thing the internet did was connect the psychopaths to everybody on social media.  we are going through a cultural revolution of how to deal with people in this way.
i remember a long time ago on twitter out of the blue one day this group of people just started to hate on me for no reason  i had barely even put anything on twitter like maybe 2 and they kept calling me the c 4 letter word  now that words does not bother me  never has  never will   but they thought it would and i m like why do you keep calling me a human body part  did you know you popped out of one of them.a word only has power if you let it  and i think people need to stop letting words like that have power  women get annoyed and upset about being all it and i m like at the end of the day your the person letting that word have power over you
ah  you should ve named her  imma . would ve been funnier great joke  otherwise  i ll have to wait till month-end afore i can afford the game   but fear not  i shall soon join the  biggit  army  too  i love your top  btw
i said it in chat yesterday and ill say it again  i absolutly love your characters name.
there is this all powerful sentence i learn as i kid that my sister taught me to say when someone called me something i wasn t.  i know you are  but what am i   and if thay repeat themselves say  then we are the same dare brother!
had to leave a discord cuz i can t stand terms like terfs and the pointless jk disrespect i am not a fan of her current work. but she is the architect of almost all our childhoods. tweets won t erase that
ima biggit  is a name that would make the phoenix wright localization team blush  i love it.
now they have found a new thing. they spam on the hogwarts legacy reddit with end spoilers . it s so sad.
yesterdays stream was pretty awesome.
the nicest biggit terf i ve ever met. seriously  love your content. just getting out the popcorn and watching how the woke went from loving harry potter  telling us christians that chose not to read the books bigots and haters  to now telling people that anyone who like the game haters and bigots.
xqc  oh no it would be a terrible if i stream hogwarts during a streaming boycott which would result in huge viewership   start stream
i had the normal pre order from early pre ordering and not knowing about the early access. i refunded it and got the deluxe just so i could play early. the game is great. its going to be on the goty lists not sure what else is coming out this year that can beat it. not sure ff16 can do anything and bethesda is trash now  dont trust them to put out anything good.
love the content lady.
waaahtavists  was worth a sub on it s own merit.
i just wanna play me wizard game in peace. i m losing my shit with how beautiful the world and hogwarts is i keep stopping every 2 seconds to take screen captures. exploring makes the game worth it alone.
biggit army reporting for duty!
exactly right  satan wants the children of god to be passive because they are the greatest threat to him. if we stand strong in the lord  evil cannot prevail.
my one homegirl is super inlove with harrypotter and its universe and some people were tryna tell her she has internalized hatred for herself all for being excited for a game she really wants to play. its ridiculous and makes me angry. she always buys me things that im into even when she doesnt like the source material or whatever. she respects it cuz i like it. and yet people cant treat her the same  it makes me angry. she just wants a cool wizard game i dont see how that makes her a hateful person.
standing at attention salute
in the words of a twisted sister song   we re not going to take it  no  we re not gonna take it anymore
the original definition of  meek  was closer to strong but restrained  or capable yet reserved.
when they seek to control you  be uncontrollable.
i don t pre order games anymore  but i m looking forward to playing on friday
pretty ironic one of the first people to get cancelled is making a come back in showing theses people s true colors and she  hasnt even done anything.
i heard once that  turn the other cheek  is greatly misunderstood.  i was told it is kind of like saying   no big deal  try again.   as in you are offering your other cheek to them and challenging them.  so in a way  what you have done is exactly that.i don t think the old testament wanted people to be pushovers.
damn  this is a good look for you melonie
heck no kirrahe  i hope you get that refence..  hold the line and be brave and powerful forces will come to your aid
ima biggit    lmao!  that is glorious!  trolling and laughing at them is the best answer.
it was so fun watching you drink some hater tears lol. hope to see some more of that. have a great day!
how would they know any spoilers   that means they watched streamers play the game which goes against their own boycott  lol
hasan s take on the jkr haters was so fucking dumb. he says these people have no power whatsoever  yet he and his friends are too scared to play the game  if they have no power why is it  not worth it   why does he pander to these exact same psychopaths on a regular basis if they are so useless  if this boycott was working even a little bit he would be all about it. but since it s a massive fail he has to distance himself from it  while still toeing the line as best he can.
this is really about being anti-cancel culture.
what i love about this whole thing is i heard these people have been so aggressive with harassing people that stream these games that they actually made someone fucking cry because of how vitriolic they were being. and we re supposed to see these people as having the moral high ground  like that s a straight up mask off moment imo.
damn ms. go boom was trying to break some hearts this video. teasing shoulderveg and touching elbows together. good lord have mercy. d nomin  p dr   et vel   y  spir to s nt ......
the woke mob sounds angry. maybe a gifted sun to their hogwart s streamer of choice will sooth the oowie to their bum
great and all and this is unrelated but will the day one patch release on the 10th  i can t be the only one who noticed some problems with glitches also what do they think about the trans character in game
they can t take the l and move on with their lives.
the marketing worked  as i got the game just to     t on the woke in the forums.however  i look forward to a mod which turns the trans character into just a normal looking man.idk how to do it myself  but ripping the face model and replacing it with a mans body   hair is all that needs to be done.kind of like what dying light 2 characters did when replacing the celebrity cast with a better model.
ahhhhh thats sweet music 2 my ears  keep up the amazing work melonie!
become ungovernable.
regardless of what some book says  i will always strongly defend myself. it s fun watching weak antagonizers crumple under my much stronger will.
why do they hate hogwarts legacy    it does not allow you to hide your wand.
the best part of waking   up  is woke tears in mah cuuup
you re really enjoying your broken clock being right moment. enjoy it.
as christians  we humble ourselves before god  but not be weak or cowardice before men. we are to stand up  defend ourselves  families  and our fellow brethren. we are also supposed to judge according to scripture  but not hypocritically.i love when ppl who dont know scripture try to use it against me.. or really the opportunity it gives me to turn it into a lesson for others to see.
there s zero point in boycotting anything  we ve seen this before  whenever people call for a boycott all they do is give it attention   make it more popular then it would ve been had they done nothing
the mob are posting spoilers for hogwarts legacy  so they re actively playing the game they re boycotting....i believe the mob must have given their single brain cell to the wrong person.
just found my new character name for every game in the future  thanks!
i don t know how i stumbled upon you  but happy i did.
cant wait to stream harry potter on twitch when i get home.
i can t wait to pick my copy up friday
if airbnb is doing that then it should be easy to get anyone banned cause most people are closely linked to someone who isn t allowed to do something or is considered bad. that s insane for airbnb to do. they are just asking to go out of business anymore.
i didnt choose to be slytherineslytherine chose me! lmaoevery fetch quest where i have to father items for someone  i keep em lol
i really wanna play this awesome game   other chosen badass ps4 games with potential   no political poison being injected into them  mel.but first i need to re-buy  re-collect   reconstruct my ps3 collection
it is actually a pretty good game all drama aside and i was not a harry potter fan tbh but been enjoying the game a lot. there is a transgender character in the game which i thought was a bug as the voice did not match the character lol... but even then these weirdos are not happy but it seems most people don t care
ima biggit
tough chaotic hufflepuffs should be called scufflepuffs
12 10 for the name! i want to be part of the biggit army!
they spoiled the ending for me today. i waited 5 years to play this game.. and they took the experience away for no reason.
the bible tells us to hate evil. i also believe in the righteous fury of god too. thank you  melonie  for shining a light on how christians are supposed to be pussified and passive believers.
i can t wait to read the harry potter books to my daughter when she is older
amen!
they should sue air bnb.
welcome!
sorry buddy that s sucks
please still play it. i can tell you  as a wise friend of mine once said  knowing what happens in something and experiencing something are actually quite different. i ve actually spoiled myself on things i wanted to do  and yet when i still do it  and get to the spoiled stuff  if it s good  it ll still be worth doing it  even without the surprise. stick it to those haters  and show that you still like what you like  even if they ruined the surprise.
the game is great  and the salt from the left is the icing on the cake.
i adore your character name! brilliant!
that one troll was a hoot.
10 10 thumbnail lol. your character is cute. i m so psyched to play this weekend.
gamerssss!! assemble!
hell yea been having blast playing the game. those petty people calling us phobes idk idk
and the game ain t even out yet and it s breaking records! can t wait too see the seething and sobbing lol
melonie happy  then me happy  what normies hate i don t have to suffer.
flawless victory!!
let s go  hufflepuff gang!
great video as always  mel.  are you doing another stream today  the biggit army are waiting lol
i m glad to be a fellow big-gut
fairly certain youtube is also shadowbanning hl letsplays   streams. subbed  commentated   watched quite a few new creators but  not a single one is showing in my feed.also when i search for new letsplays and streams  all i get are the videos of how  controversial  the game is  with petty dislike  s.
the salt must flow!
if you get called a biggot  you answer  no  i m a  insert hogwarts house
breaks record amidst boycott  breaking a record  and  boycott  are antonyms.
i am so happy to see that the hate filled mob has lost and freedom of choice prevailed. i have been playing for 2 days now and i love this game. even though i dont understand the facination with watching someone else play  i stand with the twitch streamers who have the balls to take a stand.  unitedwestand  wethepeople
early access ends tomorrow on the 9 so if you want get in on the game i you have to act tonight or you have wait till friday even if you brought the deluxe just heads up
i had no interest in the game and had never even heard of it - until the nutbags tried to boycott it and they got my attention. now i ve ordered it.
someone should call their character tiffany terf
no words needed to express my feelings about the name.
did melonie do some designer cuts on her shirt  it definitely suits her.
they see us all as voldemort lmao xd
i mean  if you were calling other people bigots  the name woulda been  ura biggit i ve not played a potter game since the first one on ps1  so it has been a day or three.  but i m tempted to pick up a copy of this  and a system to play it on  someday just for the fun of it.it s funny how so many people who don t seem to know the bible like trying to  mis quote it to the faithful.  that said  i know that to most people the  passive turn the other cheek christians  is supposedly dictated by jesus in the nt  but this is the same jesus who thrashed and tossed out the moneylenders and sacrifice salespeople in the temple.  wrongdoing cannot be rewarded  not even by being ignored.job is my favorite book  but i get why you love joshua.  for me  in the hardest parts of my damaged life  job was what kept me  generally  hopeful for better days ahead.
woke cult  reeeeeeeeeeeee the rest of us   hahaha haha.
i am bi-gender got the deluxe just to play early and love the game. thing is they just paid for the rights to use hogwarts and the world but jk her self had nothing to do with the game. anything they are doing is punishing the developers who did create a trans option in character creation. i plan to buy it on the pc not just the ps5.
this is the female empowerment i fully support.
boom waaactivists ...haven t seen that one before. like it
great video.  love that top on you melonie.
watching the bigots that call everyone bigots get put in their place... there s nothing sweeter.
the hates show up and add a viewer count to everyone s stream. thank you haters for adding ad revenue. too funny.
over 1.3 million people streamed the game on twich. add the many many more who stream elsewhere and who dont stream at all and the amount of people playing are easily doubled if not tripled. id call that an epic fail for the wackjobs. the rest of us just won the quidditch world cup.
good bless you  boom girl
can t really boycott something you weren t gonna buy in the first place  tbh. legacy lost zero money not selling copies to people who don t buy games. this situation was best summed up for me by one twitterite who posted that girlfriendreviews received  literally hundreds  of warnings to not stream the game  meaning that less than a thousand of her current  1.5m viewerbase wants her to not stream legacy. that s how irrelevant this extremely loud and extremely violent cult are in real terms. despite how commonplace the lunacy may seem due to its prevalence across the various media channels  everyone should take comfort from the fact that the  party line  does not actually reflect or represent the common person. most people are just normal people keeping their heads down  cowardly  to be sure  and a reckless behaviour  but normal.
you just got another sub. never back down.
love how you as a person doesn t care what people say or think and if you have an opinion you make known to the community and if they have a problem they must just get over it and move on and you are a true example on who to be.
its really something about being a hacktivist. i got 2 trans friends and i can see them play hogwart legacy on my steam list lol. these white women on twitter really fighting a fight that isnt theirs
wait a minute they spoil it which means they either watch it or play it. the hypocrisy!!!!
hey melonie. that blue top looks really good on you. hope you re well.
i wanted to stream it  but do i need a camera  growing up i was told i had a smile only belle  animated beauty and the beast  yes i m showing my age  could love.
i can also say im trans and playing this game. it s an effing game. the woke mob hurts trans people more than helps us.
biggitarmy love it and wambulance
in the words of the great eric july  monetize your haters
those must the tears from yesterday. still delicious lol
outstanding character named i love it
so someone posted a clip that had a character riding a broom like it was grand theft auto  tossing fireballs all over lol. is that from the game or were they just trolling the haters  either way  i m here for it. lol
melonie glad your having fun with the game nintendo about to eradicate the internet in 1hr n 36 mins
your outfits are so stylish   i wish i had style lol
miss melonie  that was a neat mug! where did you obtain it
honestly  wish more people would stand up to this insane ideology. the world needs to show these crazy s they don t really have any power  no matter how much they scream.
hey  melonie just want to tell you that sorry for missing the streaming show last night as you play hogwarts video game melonie. anyway also i just want to tell you that i am so happy that hogwarts game broke the twitch record. anyway i just want to tell you that and tell you that i am sorry for missing your streaming show last night and i hope i can make it for today streaming show for today  ok melonie. anyway also i just want to tell you that you look beautiful and lovely in this video for today. anyway hope you have had a great blessed day today and hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too if i don t chat with you later today on twitch  ok melonie. anyway have a great day and evening melonie. god bless you and your hard work that you do for your fans like me and everyone else who is following you on twitter and on twitch. anyway god bless you melonie.
i will name my character social justice
hasan parker!!parker!!!! amazing. great video  great troll  can wait to get it and record my game with my character  biggus dickus
let s remember that the woke mob is not the majority of the population. this game and its success is proof. money and numbers speak the truth. this is a battle won however the war isn t over  it has just begun. keep it up mel.
they can have our wands when they pry them from our cold dead fingers.
spoilers - maybe  i haven t played it yet so this is only what i ve heard the only thing i don t like about the plot is that it looks like they re pushing for the goblins to team up with dark wizards to have an uprising  which makes no sense because goblins are very resistant to working with wizards. it seems like it was the writers  really lazy way of getting our character to oppose the uprising  which i don t like because in the books they say that goblins are treated terribly by wizards. i would have preferred a storyline closer to what hermione does in the books with s.p.e.w.  where we help the goblins  maybe the dark wizard stole something from them and we help them get it back  .
did they actually think it wud work  ...what kind of sugar powder were they on
while i don t think this will break wokeness by itself  a humiliating  large  and very public defeat for the wokists might be what s needed to discredit the movement in the eyes of most people. the woktivists said this game would kill people. that s not something to say lightly. it would kill people. buying it was  in their minds  akin to murder. and it s selling like there s no tomorrow.
can t add much to this  so.. i need that top of yours  for my gal toons in eso.... man i hate exposing myself like this  but i need that top you have  in mithril... hear that eso  yeah  i have guy toons  but my gals toons  are the best-dressed in the game- period. so.. you know  deal. oh  and melonie  whoever s telling you to  turn the other cheek   doesn t understand the passage. who s the only man  ever  to walk this earth without sin  yeah. and what did he do to the moneychangers in his father s temple  uh  yeah. sure didn t see him  turning the other cheek  there now  did we  allowing evil to flourish  in order to avoid confrontation  i believe  is a sin of its own. that s why i never stop fighting back. been cancelled  banned  censored  more than most. so be it. i m still here  right
love the character name lol
they are realizing they are the minority.  absolutely glorious.
do their tears taste better than butterbeer
walmart haha
for a crowd  he supposedly hates fascism  they sure want to compel speech from people! that is literally fascism!
that top looks great on you. ya got nice shoulders kid!  keep fighting the good fight
imagine if they put as much effort into getting a job.
the devs literally added a trans npc into the game but they are still mad lol
the name alone is worth a like.
why harrass or cancel streamers or regular people for wanting to play a videogame  why not boycott every platform that shows the game or better yet  the companies that released the game on their platforms  if you are truly upset about the game and what it is associated with then stop playing on consoles  and pc s. then go and stop using twitch  youtube and any other platform that advertises or shows the game. truth is they will not do this because they are too scared to attack a giant and feel better bullying those that are susceptible to it.
trans fact comments more like lol.  printed some  jesus plays hogwarts legacy  t-shirts  for mates   i. went out on launch night to some pubs and a launch party.   not a potter fan myself  but i m loving the lefty salt atm.  got some copies as gifts too.
ah the good old respect me even tho i m harassing people to the point of crying love the hogwarts name
perfection
i think i want to name my character mr bigotsworth or tran s phob
i was never a harry potter fan. younger me just never got into the series.i pre ordered hogwarts legacy and want to support the game becuase i despise people who try to ruin other peoples enjoyment of the game.
i m just waiting for the mod to be released that fix the trans character tbh.
they don t have no power over everyone   everything
not wearing that hoodie like a weirdo anymore........its a great game though  more fun than i thought it would be. ravenclaw all the way.
many players  have chosen to boycott... doubtful.
ignoring the games controversy...the game is really mid
melonie  this is not just a victory. this is the biggest woke-fail of all time. i can t think of anything that trumps this  can you
mac going boom!
love how these  activists  are seething over this game   not because the game itself or the devs did anything wrong  but because it ll basically support rowling. what a pathetic and insecure group of people. also funny how they  have a problem with this game  but not the countless other things that give rowling kickbacks  like lego sets  theme parks  merch  etc.
dang melonie the game is at 701k views right now
thank you!
she probably earns more on social media talking for 1 hour a day.
@auto1nfanticid3  there is 3 dark magic spells practiced by 17-18 year olds and 1 trans character is in the game  what are you on about
melonie is so cute. wish there were more women like her out there.
gameplay will always be a first priority  good story is a  good to have  quality. plus  it s an openworld ish game  the build your own adventure is kind of implied.
deuteronomy 33 29	 blessed are you  o israel  who is like you  a people saved by the lord  who is the shield of your help and the sword of your majesty! so your enemies will cringe before you  and you will tread upon their high places. ...not sure where god says we are to hide from people...good on you for defending yourself
problem is this game is woke af and it was the biggest and most succesful bait and switch tactic the wokies have ever pulledgame takes place in england of 1800 and the game is full of black charactersseveral trans characters are in the game while the game is in the 1800your character is referred to as  they  which it alone is woke afyou cant  choose a genderthe ugandan family is awesome and za best eva with the black school of magic of course being the best because wakaaaanda forevaaaaaaaaaaaa kek
i m gonna create a character named  tara enzfobe.
i feel the woke are losing. every movie i ve seen so far this year has had little to no woke. velma  something that the woke should love  they don t. i know it s still early  but this feels like woke s dying breath.
melanie....  you have to understand jewish customs to understand that  turn the other cheek  has nothing to do with revenge.what happens is  in 1st century jewish custom  to strike someone with the left hand  it is a sign of superiority.  because the left hand is the hand you used to wipe your bottom after you use the restroom.  when you turn the other cheek  it is an insult to the person who intends to strike you  because an equal uses the right hand  and turning your head to receive the right hand  you are lesser than me  now we are equals. moreover  to insult someone by striking and who is not a slave  is an insult.  it was a fine of 200 silver to strike someone with the right hand.  400 silver to strike with the left hand.  it also was 400 silver  to strike with the back of either hand.  spitting on someone also incurred a fine.thus  if someone strikes you  punish them by forcing them to pay fines.  that is as far as revenge as it goes.here is an article that explains better  what i am talking about...from the article  in jesus s culture  people were considered all to be right handed. there was no other option  because the left hand was unclean. imagine  then  that you are facing a right-handed person  and he slaps you on your right cheek. how does he do that  he backhands you.a slap was a great insult  but a backhanded slap was far more demeaning. in the bava kamma mishnah  the traditional jewish interpretation of the law   a slap incurred a fine of 200 silver coins   but a backhanded slap required a payment of 400  the same amount as for spitting on someone. it was more than violence. it was degrading. it was what you gave to an inferior or a slave. https   www.redletterchristians.org on-turning-the-other-cheek-and-how-it-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means
you know how to slay
turn the other check doesn t mean revenge.  it means to allow them to continue cause christians will suffer.  also joshua was in the old testament  turn the other check is the new testament where the former things had passed.  this is why we no longer make daily sacrifices
waahctivists is pretty good.i been calling them diddletarians but i like that.
the lesson here is we don t entertain the tantrums of the mentally ill. abuse and harm against the mentally impaired is not right  but we do not change our culture or society to the want of the mentally impaired such as gender dysphoria. we are giving to the whims wants of mentally impaired people.
congratulations! the diverse and inclusive community of  hogwarts legacy  gamers has transformed the sale of game into a flaming rainbow of democratic victory.
waaactivits
i support trans people and good games.can t wait to play hogwarts.
yeah these people are absolutely ridiculous. if they don t want to play the game  fine. knock yourself out. but don t tell me what to do or what to believe. good grief.
bahahahahahaha this is hilarious  i absolutely love seeing this game doing so well  it s just so great seeing all these loooooosers crying.
modernists think christianity are pacifists that cannot defend ourselves. jesus wasn t a peacenic hippy  he would get out the whip and smack money changers around.
that name cracked me up.
melonie is only dunks like tacko fall
i truly love you. side note. you look exactly like sage from valorant
unironically  i would like to have a religious discussion with you.  either in private or publicly.  doesn t matter to me.and i agree.  the idea that followers of yeshuah  jesus  should be passive is due to a reinterpretation of the word  meek .  the original 16th  and 17th  century definition of the word is as a man with a sword but having restraint.  meaning  capable of violence  but restraint and calm to avoid wanton acts of violence.   be the wolf  you have a bite force of 1500 psi  but you use the same jaws to gently pick up a puppy without harm. .
it s all about weak people wanting control and power. give a weak person power and they will always abuse it wanting more and more.
wow i m fucking dumb it took me exactly 10 seconds to understand your character name at 2 58. but with that being said. hilarious!
blue outfit looks fantastic on you!
6.41   texas flag joke c 1835...in time with the game era..lol
they re even triggered that the woman with a dudes voice isn t the right kind of trans.
your video is running hogwarts legacy ads  btw.
waaaahhhctivism is great for commentary channels. we all get to watch the mental meltdowns backfire.
i bet those tears we a bit sal-tea. yes i know bad dad joke.
i got awesome creative character ideas in hogwarts legacy
lets call them what they are. the  wokegestapo
that s a pretty funny character name lolwhat a fucking move to gift that person a sub.
best  5 i ever spent.
i named my toon joura  dumas  you re a dumbass  i barely stream but hell thought it d be fun hah
ima   justa biggit   waaactivism
calling you a terf  ! did they assume that you are a feminist   for people who bemoan others assuming things  they sure do a lot of assuming.
ima biggit....priceless!!!
yeahus!   it s the world we wanted    . hogwarts legacy goty
subscribed to your channel just to piss off the perverts.
aaah yes  the very definition of being passive - in a religion where for half of history the god wasn t nice  the army of god - all angels - are strapped with swords  son of god couldn t be stopped until he let them kill him... yes. passive af...
just ignore them. geez. if we all ignored them they would go away. people love arguing. even them so they just use what you say as fuel somehow someway.
facts!
no  when we ignore them they gain social control and start getting people fired for wrong think. that s why we are in this situation now. we have to stand up and hold the line to put an end to this insanity.
sub gifting them sounds great
mel..your somthin else
ima biggot xd that s amazing
ima lovin it.
melonie mac  my favourite book is joshua  especially the part where he hung the king!woke person  melonie mac encourages the lynching of trans people in latest video
huffle tuff
when i can play  my names gonna be...hactavist crymore.
i m salty because hogwarts legacy isn t available on geforce now. stupid publishers...
i ain t in no ways passive.  that s not my calling.i ll add that i ve had people including other christians try to berate me and that doesn t play with me either.
nice top! cool sleeves! are you making a statement  with your cold shoulder sleeves  about the  wackaaactivist  lol
sjw hp fans still staying in the fandom is the biggest paradox ever recorded in history. also holy smokes nice hair.
great name lmao !
i could be way of base here but i think possibly.. just possibly the only people not playing the game and kicking up a stink were not gonna buy the game anyway.
rate my character name    first name  they .   last name  them .    har har har har har har har har
biggit army leeeeetsss gooooooooooo
lookin extra cute mel
waaactivists lol
i don t know. i m over hearing about this personally.
i ve got a better name for anybody who wants to use it  trans-am
i named my character dreidel bothways
i m playing as ivy nightshade for hufflepuff. thanks chatgpt for the name suggestion!
proverbs 14 17  a quick-tempered man acts foolishly  and a man of evil devices is hated.

4.16   i like the cat...
thanks!
silly gurl lol
u are so cute in spirit and face...love it.. get m
being forced not to do or do something is an invasion of human rights therefore i have a right to buy and play this game.
nice
ima of house biggit the third.
i been flying around on a broom like a nerd loving life . they woke cry babies lost big time . they can t steal our joy this time .
you look lovely here
what did j.k say     i still dont know
hey pretty melonie so and the victory still for gamers meanwhile  haters crying because they suck.
many  players have chosen to boycott the game...  you keep using this word.  i do not think it means what you think it means.
hahahahaha  roflmao
crusades time
love you
the triggered activists were posting spoilers  lol what sad and spiteful lives these hateful people lead  and yes  it s nothing to do with compassion and everything to do with control.
ima biggit ok lol that s a good one great name.
me no twitch.
don t back down
you do not negotiate with evil
.
is she french
you want to check out a really metal bible book  check out the book of esther.
if you play this game you re a horrible awful person! they say........so they are just now figuring out i m a horrible awful person
drink away
doesn t this clarify that you just waste to much time and energy on issues that have no impact and just for a small group of people  we all knew it was going to be successful but a small group of weirdos on the internet want to make big issues about nothing.
boom
yeah  being a follower of christ does not equate being a doormat. too many modern wishy washy christians seem to believe that we re just supposed to be passive! we re not! we are the hands and feet of god! we are called to fight.  do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth  i have not come to bring peace  but a sword. for i have come to set a man against his father  and a daughter against her mother  and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law  and one s foes will be members of one s own household   matthew 10 34-36 .
whatever
i m gonna play this game and love it.  you re destroying trans people s lives!!! .... i don t really give a fuck.
1st
first
@auto1nfanticid3  i was talking about her quoting what joshua did to the enemy king in the bible  but cool story bro
@auto1nfanticid3  sir  this is a wendy s.
@grimmmetals5290  thats really funny to imply that what i m saying is inappropriate  but melonie who claims to be christian and antiwoke is promoting a game that is not only woke  but also satanic. so what i m saying is entirely appropriate for the venue. if you disagree i d love to hear an intelligent counter argument  but you ll probably just continue with childish one liners.
bro chill out @autoainfanticide.if you feel it is wrong then don t play it  but you whining in all the comments isn t helping anyone. read about the bible telling people about eating food sacrificed to idols and apply it here. there s a bigger battle to fight than picking petty things among brothers and sisters such as this.
@meloniemacgoboom  have a great day melonie  keep up the great work keeping me entertained as i pour bars of metal for people
12 00 passivity is effeminate nonsense  and is absolutely not at all what jesus preached. he d be a false prophet just as the jews claimed he was if he did  but he did not!
why do you care so much  the fact that you even had to make this instead of ignoring it and playing the game  shows you must have a thing against trans people. i had no problem ignoring this issue completely
