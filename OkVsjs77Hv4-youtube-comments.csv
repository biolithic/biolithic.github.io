the gina carano situation really kicked this off but once they started focusing on baby yoda instead of mando i knew the show was in trouble.
i think firing gina carano also forced them to re-write the storyline of season 3  and there s a good chance she is the reason the plot changed mid season in the book of fett.  so i think her being out was part of the reason for the long delay between season 2 and 3.  i don t think they intended for a 2.5 year interval.  pretty sure fans lost interest and moved on in that time.  so firing gina caused a long delay  and we are getting their sloppy  plan b  version of the storyline  rather than the original which would have included cara dune and been much better.
i cancelled disney plus after the gina situation.  there are only two ways disney can entertain me at this point. they can apologize to gina and beg her forgiveness or they can go bankrupt
even beyond the gina carano injustice  there s another factor that disney is incapable of comprehending  the story was over. season two wasn t perfect  but it was a good wrap-up on grogu and mando s story. it was a heck of a finale  and  in my very selective mind canon  that was the end.
the whole notion of letting a show movie end and letting the audience imagine what comes next is gone. hollywood always has to tell us what happens next  even if it s like 20 years later and doesn t lineup with what s been established.
so long as disney has its hands in the dough  i will avoid putting my hands in their cookie jar.  gina was the last straw from me.  here s hoping disney sells to someone who will take care of the property.  god bless you today  girl  and thanks for sharing!
i am left very conflicted about this  on the one hand  i used to love the mandalorian and hate what it become  on the other hand it is nice to see gina carano get some form of justice  even if it is a little indirect .thanks for another fantastic video melanie  and god bless everyone
the rumor is that pablo hidalgo was responsible for her wrongful termination  and that others at lucasfilm not associated with the mandalorian had been gunning for her for months  deliberately  misleading people at disney and social media about her social media posts. to be honest  the new season has been struggling out of the gate but i attribute this to the loss of gina and her character cara dune. looks like she was a really important part not only of the mandalorian but the wider mandoverse as well. thanks to the loss of rangers of the new republic eight episodes of exposition that would have better demonstrated the sorry state of the new republic  what is really going on in the outer rim and the impending return of moff gideon than what was done in season 3  and stripped it of opportunities for powerful storytelling. i suspect gina s firing was a possible act of deliberate sabotage against favreau and the mandoverse.
i mean besides firing carano  i was already predicting season 3 to be terrible because of how they were already undoing the end of season 2  so it was obvious that we were going to get the typical kk meddling.
i ve been afraid of season 3. firing gina for nothing was such a terrible move. i m not even excited to watch.
i figure that the main reason why people just aren t tuning in is for two reasons. the first one is because a lot of people  including myself  felt that gina carano wasn t treated right. the second is that people don t want to watch something where they are constantly being lectured to and scolded about how bad they are and how they need to change everything about themselves. that s basically the reason why i think that these hellfire and brimstone preachers drive more people away from christ than towards him.
they definitely experienced some  writer s block  after s2 of mando. the most exciting parts of bobf was the mando s2.5 episodes and those basically left mando s3 with virtually nowhere to go. i would love to credit the loss of gina but their lead has still been  phoning it in  because he s been focused on his hbo show which seems to have a lot more of the hype.  by all accounts  mando s3 feels like  the book of bo katan  with a sprinkling of grogu to keep it cute.
i loved that live stream on vr  valliant renegade  show. you did great and it was funny with all the voices. i haven t heard any good news about the new mandalorian season. lately i just tune into anime. you look beautiful melonie. have a good day.
when i first saw the mandalorian  i had no idea who gina was  but fell in love with her character. then find out she s almost like the character irl. amazing person. they done fugged up.
season 2 ended with the fan base rejoicing and then they angered fans with the gina debacle. followed that up with the book of beta fett and obiwan  a reva story  dumping on legacy characters. actual fans aren t even angry anymore  they re apathetic  which is way worse.
i got the impression the actual mandalorian production team didn t want to fire gina carano. it was the @     @ big wigs at disney and lucasfilm behind it  and the mandalorian team were forced to go along with it. the fact that cara dune wasn t killed off screen  but instead  redeployed  elsewhere in the show makes me think the mando team are still hoping the fence can be mended.
that initial part where you used that expression to describe the situation was so hilarious. and refreshing  as it has been a long time since i saw anyone doing that  so it s good to see people still remember the good things from cartoons.
let s not pretend that mando tanking because of gina but she is one of the reasons but not the only one
i loved the character of cara dune a badass yet good-hearted female ex shock trooper with an alderaan-sized chip on her shoulder. the role was made  literally  i hear  for gina carano  and i was really looking forward to seeing her get her own spinoff series  rangers of the new republic . carano s unjust  politically-motivated firing was the last straw for me  even though i really liked the first two seasons of mando.i m done.
once gina was dropped  i dropped disney
they made the same mistake with the ghostbusters cartoon back in the day....too much slimer was a bad thing and the adults cut out.  disney just won t listen to the fans
you haven t watched this season then
@insertlastname6784 yes we did. it s bad.
@kevin burke   if anything they are focusing on bo katon more than mando this season... i know we have reasons and ideas but if you watched the first 2 seasons maybe boycotting out of guilt isn t the best option
@pierrewillful  it s just stupid how bo katan  a female  saves the mandalorian  a male several times. it s like she s all of a sudden way more powerful than him. it doesn t make sense.
they haven t started focusing on grogu  you dolt. he s getting far less screen time that in s1.
@kevin burke  i get that... and as seasoned as din is those two moments were quite out of character for him.. but thankfully that was the only instance and din is somewhat back to his normal self
yet  noone knows who the tittle is about. the mandalorian  can easily be referring to grogu  because he is a mandalorian foundling.
you get all of that from a dip in ratings  the impending doom of disney
or they were filming the last of us.
yeah they admitted that. they was hoping people would have forgotten about the firing of gina carano. the only way to save it is bring back gina carano.
lol you are giving to much credit for her side character.
@davii  apparently not just look at the ratings.
@dutch fury  lol but it ahs little to do with gina and more to do with people not wanting to watch boba feth show and rebels to understand the history.
@davii  i don t think so but you have the right to your opinion.
thats literally the reason why . bo katan is heavily in season 3she was written in to replace cara. dave filoni said that.   cara was suppose to get her own spin off which i imagine season 3 was gonna be the jumping off like fett was in season 2. if they made a bo katan series it would be crazy to have 3 different mando shows and we only got one jedi show wirh kenobi which is the focal point of starwars.
now it s the bo kataan show  just like book of boba and fennec  or obi wan- a reeva story. they simply don t want these female characters to have their own shows  since the viewership numbers would be dismal  so they basically high jack better known sw characters  and completely emasculate them to the point of their characters becoming unrecognizable. it s criminal
@aisha alamoudi  there are many more complaining then you obviously know.
i was kinda indifferent to her firing  felt like it was inevitable but feel like there are bigger problems than just her not being there. star wars as a whole has gone downhill and i d be a fool to say all of this is because gina s not there anymore. seems shortsighted.
yup  yup.  bang on.  now they have a fucking bush as a pirate captain.
where have you been  the show always focused on baby yoda.
@dave davidson  not to this extent.
wtf are you talking about  the show was always focused on  baby yoda   grogu  from the beginning when he was discovered by din djarin in the first episode of the show. you really aren t paying attention bro
@insert last name  are you blind  they tie by to order66 and make a deal out of it  it s only been a few episodes anyways
@crazy ralph  i thought fennec was a cool cyberpunk waifu but i never watched season 2 if there is one.
@kevin burke  sorry but bo katan is way more skilled than mando is  she was a fighter in the clone wars  she fought for mandalore and survived the purge all of which was against people equally as powerful  whereas din mando was just a bounty hunter going after weaker targets than himself  even boba fett in reality should be a little more skilled than mando
@the aces  uhhhh  what  din has way more skills than bo katan. they totally nerfed him in season 3. saying that she is stronger than din is total cap.
@theaces3697  last time i checked  it was called the mandalorian show  not the bo katan show.
@kevin burke  you just seem mad. it s great because she is a true badass. if you even knew anything about the character. so a man saves a woman. yay! a woman saves a man  ohhhh nooooo
@marty mck  uhh yes to this extent. also baby yoda is a still a d was always going to be set up as a big character
@kevin burke  it s so clear you don t know anything g about her character . she is far more skilled than mando a d always a badass
@raf  kevin has a point.  mando is the title character and he did get relegated to a damsel in distress in his own show to promote bo in episode 2.  this is behaviour has come be predicatable and boring from disney tv shows and movies  we saw it happen with loki and hawkeye in their own shows off the top of my head.that said  i thought episode 2 was still a strong episode  episode 3 spent way too long stretching out a plot point with some painfully boring  poorly written and frankly embarrassing to watch scenes.  a far cry from traditional star wars high adventure fantasy.then we got the monster bird and pirates of the caribbean.  i m done with it personally  it feels stale.
@raf   -----found the disney simp.
@kevin burke  nah i am just a fan of mandolorian the show. come back to me when you have a better comeback. still shows you don t know jack shit about bo katan based off your reply.
@kevin burke  btw i hate many many disney shit right now. but nice try on the  simp  part. try harder next time
@raf686  i do know. bo katan is hardly a great character. i watched the clone wars and she didn t do much of anything.
@raf   -----
@raf686  in fact  i watched the majority of all star wars and she doesn t make many appearances or makes any indication that she s stronger than din djarin. even in the mobile game  din is stronger than bo katan.
@raf686  if you like the mandalorian then you are a disney simp. thanks for proving my point.
@raf686  also  what about the episode with the scientist  he literally has 0 tie in with the mandalorian so far but they did a full episode on him for some reason. the story writing is garbage.
this is the best season of the show. i was a carano fan  the show doesn t need her. if you don t want to watch because of her your opinion of the show is null and void. especially from someone who isn t really a sw fan. this is a weak opinion. and you don t like the last of us  weird.
@kareem montes  no it s not the best season of the show. season 1 was the best season.
@kevin burke  my dude you do realize bo katan is in more things than just this show right    wow how dense  can you be  bo katan has existed for years and years in star wars lore. read up a bit more bud because this show is not the  only thing she has been on. which is fine. you seem to have issues with females anyways. if they save a man. nope big issues.
@raf686  i didn t say she didn t appear in other shows  just that her appearances were generally short and didn t show much of her abilities. she was generally seen fighting along side general kenobi  so we never really saw her actually fight by herself.
@raf686  women saving men is how disney became woke to begin with and it is terrible writing. again  it was more than just that episode.
@raf686  after reading all about bo katan  she lost to maul and savage opress  she tried to save her sister and failed  she let her leader die  and basically only succeeded in rescuing kenobi from captivity along with several other members. she failed a lot more times than she succeeded and doesn t come off as a powerful person to begin with. she s definitely not as strong as s1 and s2 din djarin.
@kevin burke  and she has conqured so many others. is that all you gave to name  also i bet you hated gina s characters too. you can keep acting like your points are making sense but they are not. also the fact that you use  simp  as your defense mechanism word is hilarious. you can carry on all you want but you dont phase me. you are a random person on the internet. like me and the rest here. but you very well need some help  since mando hurt you somewhere so deep. maybe physically and emotionally who knows. but that s none of my buisness lol.
@raf686  not only that  but in s3 of mandalorian  she is literally the last surviving member of her group and after sitting on her throne and doing nothing for so long and just all of a sudden become op and beat a creature that din djarin couldn t beat  din has consistently been in combat  doesn t make sense.
@raf686  nope  gina was awesome. i like gina because she is a true powerhouse conservative unlike the other wimpy characters.
@raf686  i see you are just a troll who knows nothing though. you can t even name an example of what made bo katan great.
@kevin burke  so wait you think she is goi g to forget her training just like that and boom she is op  wtf are smoking. yeah i have to conserve my brain cells with you.
@raf686  uh  yeah. if you don t use it you lose it. not practicing makes people forget their skills. this is common sense.
@raf  and you still provided 0 examples of how bo katan is stronger than din djarin. she literally failed everyone and everything based on her bio.
@kevin burke  oh i have. you just don t like female hero like characters that are actually good like bo katan.  can t do much when talking to a wall also the lore is more than shows. i am not here to hold your hand. it s all out there bud. don t be lazy.
@raf686  i already looked. there were 0 accomplishments from her that made her stronger than din djarin. in season 1 and season 2 of the mandalorian  din djarin took out gigantic beasts in one hit and in s3  he struggles to wield the sword that he wielded so proficiently in s2  that makes a lot of sense  not.
@raf686  they totally nerfed him to the point where he does nothing now and they spent a whole episode on a scientist and not din djarin. the whole thing is stupid. they should have just ended it at s2.
@kevin burke  cool story man. btw i did jot even read your new comment.
@raf686  your comments have only shown that you have 0 defense and no actual arguments because you never came up with any examples and then you said you don t read my comments. keep going. you just outed yourself.
@kevin burke  nice. cool.
season 3 just isn t the same. there are no stakes. moff gideon is in prison so there is no threat. he turned down a good job to join the cult again but the writers seem to forget that he broke his oath for a good reason. boba fett show should have been the end of it
@david-qi2ck  exactly! it seems there s still disney simps on here though that defend season 3 s garbage.
it always was about the child and bo-katan. djin is a secondery character.
@ariel shpitzer  no he isn t.
@arielshpitzer  the mandalorian is literally about din djarin. bo katan didn t even appear until the final episode of season 2.
@kevin burke  grougu has straight connection between his blood and to cloning of palpatine. djin isbirrelevant.if it wasnt about the child he woudnt have appeared episode 1.
@arielshpitzer  i know that grogu was important  but din djarin is not irrelevant. if he is  then that s even more bad writing from disney. hence why disney is going out of business and the firing purge is happening. bob iger is already stepping down again and s3 of the mandalorian has the lowest ratings yet.
to all you mandalorian disney defenders  the mandalorian is canceled after s3
@kevin burke  you have no idea what you re talking about. you re just mad trump is getting indicted or something.
@kareemmontes  i do know what i am talking about. the mandalorian is being canceled after s3 and disney is going broke.
@kareemmontes  and trump is not indicted.
@kareem montes   ----found the john balnis bot.
@kevin burke  lol i could tell by your replies in here you would be upset about trump.
@kareem montes  nope  trump is going to go whabam on braggs because braggs never had a case to begin with.
@kevin burke  i bet you were shure ned stark is the main character of game on thrones in season 1....
@arielshpitzer  i didn t watch game of thrones so lol at you.
@arielshpitzer  i read one book of game of thrones and it had the stupidest story known to man. they kept arguing with each other and there were 0 combat in the first book. it was just  we are going to get you   no we are going to get you   over and over again. i was like   i am done
@vernon  do you think most people are on social media 24 7  do you think they know who gina is even when she was on mandalorian let alone 3 years afterwards  you think the people who watch streaming know all the scoop and dirt behind the scenes
no  what  kicked this off  was acts 3 and 4 of return of the jedi. lucas sold out with those  ucking ewoks. star wars has been dog  ever since
same here  i personally just wanna see disney fail at this moment.
same.
they need to apologize to george too. for the sequels. until they acknowledge the mistakes made in those films  i won t be invested.
gina....is that you  hahaha
i agree. i haven t spent  1 on disney since they fired her.
i never subscribed to their streaming service and the last disney product i bought was 9 years ago
lol disney runs the movie business  do you really think they will go bankrupt over a person that doesn t even matter
your mind canon doesn t actually matter  since they are connecting different shows towards thrawn  the story wasn t over.
boba fett followed up on that story.
well said.
@agherosh  of course his  mind canon  doesn t matter  but i m sure he doesn t feel compelled to watch anymore and is content with where he stopped at.
same
have to agree there
@agherosh   that s not the point he was making.  he s basically saying he s fine ending it at season 2. everything else is white noise for viewership.
definitely should have been over at the end of season 2..... but you have to understand disney  grogu was a huge money maker for disney and the only thing that actually worked in a long time so obviously that s like crack to disney  execs and they re not going to let that go if there s any more money to be squeezed out of it
agreed! i am hoping disney   marvel etc.  all burn to the ground!
the whole notion of having plans for a show to link with other shows and have a bigger storyline doesn t seem to be well understood for people who just want things to end whenever they please.
@agherosh  well you know if people were content with things ending where they end lucas would ve never made the prequels but his merchandising rights were gonna end and he needed a new movie to keep them and that s where he made all his money was through toys and clothing
you can thank things like the mcu for that basically. single unified universes are the rage with many companies. i ve been hearing even the mario movie may setup a nintendo cinematic universe.  i m trying to avoid spoilers about this  which as a longtime nintendo fan sounds great but in some ways sounds bad honestly. like let things just stand alone already. let us have real endings and peace.
@chris carlos  it doesn t sound great...you excited for a trans  link  to battle ganon with quips  it would be horrible and i d lose all respect and hope for movies going forward...moreso than i have with endless needless sequels and prequels.
one of the problems with streaming  it doesn t have the market share that broadcast television had  and now we see short seasons  and the actors and artists have to make each episode count  the streaming shows are looking more like the professionalism of motion pictures.  motion pictures  the big movie studios  puts everything onto single movies  and because of this  they have the highest quality artists in the entertainment business.  when disney went toxic to actress gina carano for bizarre reasons  this only hurt the show  it is not like you have twenty five episodes per season to recover  that broadcast television did.
...hasn t really worked though has it  boycotting disney  for 2 years  it gained 100 million subs and won the streaming wars in record time.... you guys were even pitting gina against pedro cause he s woke  he s bigger than god right now  gina is....i ve no idea.
i agree   who was really offended by   what gina said anyway  and pablo is nothing  but  an untalented scumbag.   season 2 ending  of mandalorian garnered a lot of support and favreau and filoni  probably got a lot of praise.   instead of striking while iron was hot they chose to be  petty and pathetic and sabotage john and dave in the worst way possible while affecting the entire company
@sandrock  people who s ideologies claim to be as far as possible from nazism  yet are all but indistinguishable from it.
agreed. cara dune was one of the best things about the series. what was done was not only an injustice to gina carano  but to the show as well.
@sandrock  yes!! this is what i m saying!!
@rambleon07  yes!!
@christopher davis  absolutely!!!!
her character wasn t even in all the episodes !!  and her acting was criticized and mocked by even you guys. you wanna make it about that for redemption when there s none. the show is still a hit and is till greenlit for season 4. it just seems old news at this point.
@aisha alamoudi  i will freely admit that gina carano is not the world s best actress  but she brought a physicality and authenticity to the role of cara dune that many of us liked. she was fired for political reasons  and that s soured a lot of people  including myself  on the show going forward. it may be  old news  to you  but it still bears repeating particularly in light of season three s diminished viewer count.
@aisha alamoudi  mocked by us! !  are you mad !  we supported her then just as much  if not more so than we do now!!
i dunno ms. carano has never been good at acting not as bad as mk11 s sonya blade  but she s pretty awful lets be honest.
@star rain  ok then....how about no!
@azurewyrm 66  wasnt she in that one movie where they had a different actor record her voiced lines because she was so bad at speaking   ok i looked it up  haywire.
@azurewyrm 66  ...i thought you guys were always  leave politics out of entertainment . i guess you support politics in entertainment if they re your politics. when an actress says the birth scenes in house of the dragon are about abortion laws  did you hurry to champion her freedom of speech  nope  you were the ones attacking. there s a movie in the box office right now with christian propaganda  it s trying to shove christianity down our throats  will you guys join me in protest     nope  you want more of it...   this would bother me if liberals didn t always run culture  so this always goes their way. it was only yesterday when you threw a tantrum over brokeback mountain trying to ban it from theaters. look now we have gays in every show and film.
@azurewyrm 66  mocked for her acting yes. remember she used to be with disney and you didn t know much about her  so you guys lumped her with evil disney and woke pedro pascal...she won you over after the controversies.
@aisha alamoudi  who are you talking about  you make a lot of assumptions about someone you ve never met.
@aisha alamoudi  i never mocked gina s acting and i ve always supported her. again  you make a lot of assumptions based on a deplorable lack of facts.
but they are actually needed  the hellfire and brimstone preachers   because they still reach people.we actually need both kinds.
@jack levitt  i became a star wars fan in 1995. i m now completely apathetic towards it. i ve heard that andor was actually good  but i can t summon the willingness to watch it. and yet i still love the old republic  mostly because disney hasn t poisoned it yet.
yup  don t give a fuck anymore  since 1999 at 5 years old i ve loved this franchise  now i m just waiting for the video games
it s tanking because of kk and pedro... not gina. everyone voices their opinions but gina isn t allowed to have one.
@tubeamerica  i know it sucks
@tubeamerica  while kk and pedro had an influence on why my family and friends stopped watching mandalorian  gina was the main reason.
couldn t agree more. i was a huge fan of the mandalorian  and love cara dune. when they fired her  that was the last straw for me as well  and  have had nothing to do with sw or disney since.
the show is a snooze fest anyway  terrible lore aside lol. you look happy lately  it s so great to see that. like i said before  take your time and don t worry about the vids. we re always here whenever you drop some bangers like this! have an amazing day and keep being strong!
the news isn t surprising.  the book of boba fett and obi wan turned many more fans off.  i didn t mind andor and i found it intriguing.  i ve been watching season 3 even though i told myself i wouldn t because of gina.  the writing seems kind of messy at times.  the last chapter that came out wednesday is when the season really started coming together.  any way time to go boom.
well they changed the concept from a space western vibe and the bounty hunting.should have followed concept of detective shows  where each episode can stand alone and keep the season to season larger story development to 5-10  of screen time.
tbh the reason i think people dropped off the show is also the story backsliding and going back to low stakes random af stuff  when s1 s2 had a buildup to a war to retake the mando homeworld that whole plot is dropped for more messing around.
it ended the story of grogu but then they brought him back in book of boba fett and ruined it. it did have good ideas of making the mandalorian alone by himself ostracized from his clan for removing his helmet and hated by bo-katan for taking the darksaber. grogu is just there to sell toys and is a distraction. what they have is really interesting for season 3 but they re isn t enough focus. i think people are turned off after book of boba fett sucking and kenobi being underwhelming.
i think disney is burning people out. honestly this season has been great so far. maybe we will gina at some point again and i hope we do. dave filoni is bringing in the star wars rebels story and excited to see the continuations with ahsoka. and to those complaining there arn t good female main characters look no more one of my favorite star wars character.  i do hope for more mandalorian too. i have my theory on who the armorer is and even more confident in it after the current episode...house wren
the problem with that situation is that it will give levage to kk to fire favro and put the blame on him and save her own ass. she managed to get a part of the praise with the first 2 seasons  cause hollywood   and now she will have something against favro and feloni.
i m just here to watch melonie make funny noises.
i loved the character of mando. since he s become known as din djarin  i think the story has strayed into the clone wars. some say that is a good thing and yes  i loved the clone wars and some say it s just fan service. it s a tough balance having to try and get the audience that the sequel movies have pushed away and for at least season 1 and parts of season 2  they were doing that.....might be that favreau filoni got a bit to big in their britches and thought they could head where they are with no loss in viewership.
what s confusing me is that there s a weird time jump from season 2 to season 3  i don t like that i have to watch a different show to be up to date
i hate waiting for the next week to get another episode. i m sure i m not the only one that will wait til the whole season is over before watching the entire season.
another great take  i planned to review the mandalorian. but just did not feel like giving it more attention  no matter how meager my channel is . anyway this was great.
this could possibly be the final season. good things come to an end at some point.
ep 1 of season 2 got me into the mandalorian  i reckon it fulfilled and honored lucas s vision  and it became even more popular  but i haven t suffered season 3  bobf  kenobi the depeche mode song got my attention but i haven t watched other tlou after that.
gina carano and her fans have been validated.
i also liked seasons 1 2 for the most part.  i wanted to watch a tv series about din djarin a fallen mandalorian seeking redemption and traveling the galaxy on bounties maybe with added humor  like the firefly tv series  being apart of a bigger story introducing good supporting characters  like they did with gina carano and timothy olyphant .  where is it going now  well what disney does best dividing people  they call it diversity uniting inclusive .  now it feels din mando is a side character and everyone else is front in center.  the women are smarter  stronger and need to rescue this poor highly skilled male bounty hunter.  inclusive       that creates divide.  i am tired of  the modern hollywood telling a story about another character or the universe at the expensive of the main character  male  in their own self titled movie or series  cough obi-wan kenobi and dr strange  the witcher .  the plot is just meander around. disney will drive it agenda into the ground loose     and just raise the price on their parks.  it not about us the fans but a bunch of bad writing rooms on their agenda of supposed inclusiveness diversity at the expense of the stupid male. it s like a bad marriage where it went heavy on one side to the other.  not being on the same page and having the common goal of balance.at least in the fast and furious movies  love or hate them  everyone was welcome at the dinner table. just mind the house rules  reference to saying grace at dinner
grogu s story should have ended at the end of season 2 for us and mando should have moved on to the next chapter of his life in season 3.
hoping she gets hired back. i know filoni and favraeu want her back. hopefully they can bring her back for season 4 and we get her rangers show eventually. a special ops new republic show would be sick!
the mandals in season 3 episode 2 gave me terrible call backs to the hyperactive fruicakes in covenant who trip over themselves n randomly panic misfire their weapons not bothering to use proper cqb team coordination when in confined areas and end up killing emselves off without any help from the xenomorphs.
i ve never loved watching the mandalorian  but carono brought credibility to the fight scenes. from what i ve seen so far  s03 feels like it was written by a really talented 15yo. it s not  horrible   but the story is one dimensional and the fight scenes are terrible.i still have no earthly idea why the mandalorians would not post guards in front of their entrance if they re accustomed to dragons and sea creatures taking off with their kin on a regular basis.
retaking the homeworld has literally been the whole plot to s3 so far  says a lot about the attention you pay when you watch stuff.
@agherosh yeah i m honestly confused as to why people are complaining about season 3... i ve greatly enjoyed watching this season.  also  your right. this entire season is building up to the mandalorians taking back thier home world.... as for the gina situation.... i simply don t know what happened and i honestly don t care... i don t concern myself with bs social media drama. that and i don t see that her role was as insanely important as people are saying....
underwhelming   well that is a strange way to spell shit.
they should have kept him off screen until the last episode of season 3.    totally ruined opportunity for disney.

i find it funny that ncis reruns are doing better than a lot of the newer shows. it just goes to show ya  how bad most of this newer  turd slinging  business model is working.
the way i see it  the mandalorian is  or maybe now just was  keeping the star wars franchise on life support.
melanie  it probably should ve been a miniseries. they clearly didn t have a plan going forward but they didn t have another star wars series with its numbers.
glad to see those who said they would boycott the show because of gina s firing actually followed through.
i notice at 11 40 that you described the strategy as interesting - i note  to quote a certain anime character  you said  interesting  not  good thanks for this video  melonie mac! go boom! and god bless  d
imagine if disney came out  apologized for firing gina carano  by saying at times of heightened emotions  people can make the wrong decision  and then announce a cara dune series. that s all they d need to do for many to give them one more chance. then all they d need to do is produce a quality product. producing something better than they ve been doing doesn t seem like much of a challenge. but a public apology is something they ll never do  not even to save the company.
i am 100  not surprised at the numbers tanked for season 3  i feel that way because i actually watched the 1st episode... and i said well that s stunk but i ll give it a few more episodes to see what happens  then haven t had the desire to actually sit down and watch another episode of it
totally agree on the disney boycott and that season 2 was a solid endpoint.  add to that  disney sw destroyed two high  high potential shows in obi wan and book of boba fett.  why would anyone have hope for more star wars tv shows   and when we got back to mando  i just assumed that it would be dave filoni s mental self pleasuring over all things mandalorian.  the mandalorian season 1 worked because  for the most part  we only spent time with 1 mandalorian.  we want the man with no name.  we want a western in space  a lone gunman making his way through a rough universe.
i do think the people are making a bigger deal about gina getting fired than the show does. what i mean is that the people that hate gina are taking every new character or story point to be anti gina or created because gina was fired. were in reality cara was getting hew own spinoff and the new plot points are things more hardcore fans have been looking for for a while. i actually am enjoying this season  i do miss cara dune but i think the new focus on mandalorians in general to be cool  i think that is something more hardcore fans will enjoy more than casual fans so if people dont wanna watch for whatever reason for me that is ok.
everybody is just waiting for the season to be released in its entirety so we can renew our membership for one month and binge it  bad batch season 2  and any marvel movies we didn t want to pay full price to see in theaters. then we ll bounce. disney will not get regular members again until they start treating fans and their respective fandoms with respect. correcting course hard and releasing the various popular series they ve held hostage on their streaming platform as physical media is the only way to recoup from their revenue hemorrhaging.
i would love season 3 if they had just left baby yoda with luke skywalker and only focused on mando bringing his people together and possibly even him fighting the empire while digging further into the empires cloning plan for palpatine snoke
i feel like they had to come up with any kind of reason to let her go mainly because her character would have eventually eclipsed the main characters. i don t think they were banking on her character being really big.
her movie terror on the praires with daily wire is awesome
it s like disney isn t even trying to make money anymore. maybe they made a deal with the  you will own nothing and be happy  crowd.
firing gina corano was their biggest mistake. she didn t deserve the hate she got. great video melonie! hope you re doing well. praying for you everyday and god bless!
people hated the sequel movies  and they are clearly getting rid of the independence of the mandalorian  and just making it a prequel to those movies. people want a bad ass luke  but they want us to see him become pathetic so rey will look better.and gina s firing is just one of the symptoms of the hollywokeness.
great to see a new video  melonie. love the hair today
i m a gina fan  yet i m not spiteful that the ratings are crap.  if they even are...  why the gloating   i find it sad that a few people at the company and that  woman  has killed story telling of the star wars universe.
mandalorian series without gina carano is not mandalorian series anymore  sadge
season 3 is kicking ass without gina but that s just my opinion... that being said i thought ginas character was really badass  she did a wonderful job in the series and also i wish they would ve never fired her ...she should really come back....  another thing i really don t think she carried the show at all...also my opinion.
only reason grogu is back is because kathleen had him added back in in the book of boba to sabotage the mandalorian s story. shes been gunning to sideline it ever since it blew all the garbage she made out of the water.
holy moly  thank youuu!
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
you ve been boycotting disney  for 2 years over gina  in that time  it gained 100 million subs  and won the streaming war in record time and is about to overtake netflix. but you ignore all of that and zero in on a dip in ratings for a single show on disney  to project utter doom    do you really not see how silly that is    i didn t even mention gina s career since or how you pitted her against the woke pedro pascal  i think they speak for themselves.
honestly same here. it seems people are praying on the shows downfall.. very weird activity
as a pre-disney faloni fan i m laughing.
i admit  when they pulled that shit with gina was the last straw. then they lost me for good.
i m starting to think that hollywood needs to go to relationships counseling cause they re losing a lot when dumping their best actors
the fired gina  took two years to bring out season 3 and lost some hype with the delay  but its now the bo-katan show. don t get me wrong  i ll watch a bo-katan show  but this should be the din djarin show.
melanie maybe also talk about the restrict act bill. if you could  please
season 3  brought to you by the marketing department of disney.   i hate it for those working on the show who need the checks for paying their bills  but for some of the jackwagons in management and some of the adult pretenders i hope they lose jobs over this.i agree that season two had the perfect series ending.  if nothing else  it was ending the story on a high point for luke  which we all loved to see.  i didn t need more either  but i can understand other fans wanting more  and disney marketing wanting to push push push more grogu as its only marketable character.i would have watched rangers of the new republic starring gina as cara dune  even if it had a rotating cast of rangers including people like cobb vance.  but with their firing decision  nope.  not interested.  especially considering how they crapped on fan favorites like obi-wan and boba fett.
you explanation about why you are not watching it - i think this sums up so many shows now.  people are burned out on the time investment into a good thing and then them ruining it.
it is obvious they crammed 2 mandalorian episodes into book of boba fett.so then they repurposed and incorporated 2 episodes from the scrapped  rangers of the new republic  into their plans for season 3 of mando.causing everything to be a jumbled mess.something tells me they are going to do some huge luke nostalgia bait to close out the season and finish it strong....but i think the damage has been done.
honestly  i ve just been waiting for all of the season to be available before i watch.
baby yoda might as well been wearing a leather jacket and water skis when he jumped over that mando
at fan comic conventions and online in t-shirts and cosplay it seems like the most popular cosplay remains to be classic luke  classic han  classic leia  and chewbecca. perhaps they could work off those characters somehow    i liked mandalorian season 1 but i have yet to get caught up with 2 and 3 yet.
every time you say tomb raider  bartoli s hideout from tomb raider 2 pops in my head lol  thanks melonie
here u go   i think u earned this hope ur having a great weekend god bless u and stay safe fam don t ever let the haters get to u ur an amazing woman
i also loved the first 2 seasons but by bringing grogu back for the 3rd really does crap all over that heart breaking ending of season 2....
i totally agree. you also made me giggle
i am definitely laughing. gina did not deserve to get fired
the only reason i m watching this season at all is because they didn t kill off ranger dune off-screen  so there s still a slim chance she could come back in a post kathleen kennedy era.
for sure.  season 2 finale was the end of the entire show.
gina is not the biggest reason why s3 is failing  it s the poor to average writing and directing
i loved the first two seasons of the mandalorian too.  i haven t watched the third season but it sounds like i m not missing much.  star wars is seeming like a dead franchise.  disney just keeps making bad decisions.
thank you so much  it means a lot
in other news  picard season 3 has been amazing. basically next gen season 10.
it s alright  you all can have your convictions but the show is still good and enjoyable
reading these comments tells me a lot. i think most of you haven t seen season 3 nor do you care about the gina situation most of y all just wants to agree with mel. i don t think the numbers have anything to do with gina it s more of the delay between season 2 and 3. and in between those we got a sub par boba fett show and a bad obi wan show they wanted to put out first hence the 2 and half year delay. season 3 hasn t been bad at all.
season 1 of the mandalorian was the only not bad disney star wars  well no good thing lasts forever i suppose
granted  s2 was dope as hell with gina  ming  katee  and bill burr. it s the best star wars besides andor  imo. s3 isn t as strong  but i m really enjoying bo katan s arc.
the first two seasons were amazing and i m liking season 3  however it just doesn t have the same feel the first two did.  i like bo katan as a strong female character but disney totally screwed up when they fired the best female character that they could hope to have.
get woke go broke  this was especially ridiculous because gina is one of the biggest sweethearts of all time.
i don t think gina is the reason it s failing. she was a side character. there s a few reasons it s failed. 1. groku was just back and they didn t bother to recap why he was back. i had to look up what happened. it seems they are forcing you to watch all of the star wars tv shows. in which all of the other star wars tv shows have been horrible. 2. the other star wars shows are garbage. i wouldn t be surprised if people got tired of shity star wars shows or just star wars in general on disney plus.3. the writing was all over the place. he needed that specific robot  but then ditched him pretty quick as well as a few other issues.4. episode 3 was poorly done. it s the lowest viewed episode  iirc. they just abruptly switch the story to a bigger story. it should have been intercut with the past episodes. surprise surprise  i watch the mandalorian  to watch the mandalorian... not scientist. i don t mind them focusing on secondary characters  but we spent 40 minutes and i completely different story. with that said  i am still enjoying this season. however  i want to be mad if it didn t end on the previous season  since it wrapped up that story very nicely.
outer banks beating out the mandalorian is awesome. star wars being beat by a high-school  coming of age  treasure hunt show should make lucasfilm reevaluate their streaming g strategy.
agree 100  the end of season was a good way to finish. but for me baby yoda is the very worst thing in the show  and i cant face watching more if he is starring in it as it were
the good thing about coming home after a busy trip is having 2 go boom videos queued up for me for lunch
as i see it  kennedy is still creeping around meddling in things. i honestly believe if the bobs would have fired her ass. the franchise could have recovered. her weird politics has wormed into everything.  i m still of the mind that gina did nothing wrong  that s the problem with the platforms. everything can be taken a million different ways. i had hoped jon could ve gotten gina back at least for season 3 if not for rangers. kennedy even started messing with this season until jon finally put his foot down. she will destroy the franchise  if she doesn t the woke hollywood will
yes i would love to have her back but she is not the lead character so i still watch it and like it.
i think that firing gina carano was a big mistake and they should apologize to her for firing her from the disney show. anyway this is a great video melonie   you did a great job with making this video for us to watch and make a comment about your video melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today   hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great weekend too.
thanks for the shoutout melonie!
love gina! true hero
you know i hadn t even thought of that. for some reason i just lost interest. obi wan was incredible.
gina fans   we have spoken
we need gina back !!
yeah it was bad up to this latest episode.. finally got better
and they are renewed for season 4. either way disney is still laughing all the way to the bank.
pretty sure they did but she had already committed to being an executive producer at the daily wire  you don t give up a position like that to go back to work for disney after getting fired for no reason.
three new videos this week ! yes!! thank you  melonie! i know you re dealing with a bunch of stuff behind the scenes that you have to stay quiet about  but i m praying that god will move powerfully in your life. i m praying that he would move in such a way that you will see his hand at work and that you will sense his presence beside you. i m praying he will help you to walk fully in his blessings and his goodness. that he would open the right doors for you  and that he would close the wrong doors. i pray that he would establish and bless the work that you do  and give you a heart full of wisdom  discernment and strength. and ultimately  i m praying that you would come away from all this more refined and more of the woman god has called you to be. sometimes  just like joseph  we have to go through trials in order to get us to where god wants us to be.because real talk... melonie  you have the voice and messages that people need to hear. this world is crumbling and getting nuttier by the hour  and people need to know about how salvation can only be found in jesus. the gospel is so vital at this hour of history. and anyone who may try to cancel you for talking about jesus is actually giving you a backhanded compliment. the enemy wouldn t get this agitated over you if you weren t a threat to his depraved kingdom. so just know that your efforts to continue making content  even with all that you re going through  is very much appreciated   but just for the record  you could spend 18 minutes talking about the stitching pattern on the cloth used for lara s shorts and i d listen just because of how passionate you can get about tomb raider  but my favorite videos are when you get biblical and talk about god. i think that s when you shine the brightest
major problems with it right now  imo. grogu is pointless now. they can t really do anything with him. something as small as him attempting combat is cringe af to watch. literally looked like they just tossed a toy through the air  in a way they did. and cute little baby cooing isn t the hook it was the first two seasons. they should have had him force choke the mando kid  lol. and they ve also made some odd choices this season of that have pushed din out of the spotlight and what replaced him wasn t that interesting. it s cool seeing more mandalorians but there presence alone is also starting to take the shine of din because it makes you realize he s not a super mandalorian warrior  he s just another mandalorian fighter. bad batch has been much better this year than the mandalorian  andor was better as well.
in 2020 when s2 came out i was still working from home. in fact for all of s2 i was working from home. i back at work now and i am not current on most shows.
season 3 episode 5 is  so i could careless for the views count
no gina no mandalorian !is as simple as that !edit  cutest first 7 sec of a video ever
the gina carano firing is precisely why i cancelled my disney subscription to this very day. me and my gf. i know i m not alone in this.also  season 2 ending was perfect. easy to stop right there and pretend nothing else exists.
aside from the one bad episode mandalorian season 3 has been great especially the last episode.
haha the thing that got stuck from the whole video was your  blrlrbrb  sound when you expressed how disney tanked and the face that went with ut.
i like how the movement was like we need more strong female characters and then proceed to kick off and fire the best one
gina carano and katee sackoff should do charity oil wrestling. that would be entertainment.
the mandalorian viewership tanked like the executor plummeting into death star 2. and that s good because admiral ackbar is gina fan too.
i spent most of my life as a star wars fanboy. what disney has done to star wars broke my heart. i m done with star wars.
i m not sure this has anything to do with gina carano  i thing people just don t trust disney to make a star wars show anymore.there was sequel trilogy who sucked  we lost hope then mandalorian came up  we got hyped again  then we had the book of boba feat and kenobi... it s just too inconsistent to get hyped again  if is good we ll watch again eventually when we bored or have nothing to do  but follow the show  i don t think so.
i ve enjoyed season three  but i hate that they fired gina carano. the good news is that they didn t kill her off. they said she was off serving the republic somewhere thus leaving room to bring her back. hopefully that will happen.
have a great weekend melonie mac
we have kathleen kennedy to thank for most  if not all  of season 3 s problems.  she fired gina  forced the cameo by jack black and his on-screen wife and have insisted on more  but felloni and favreau have managed to make sure that there ll be no more in the mando. kk has caused lots of other problems. favreau wanted to spend more time on season 3 apparently   but that would have moved that back by a year.kk and her friends are causing so many problems. i don t mind gay or powerful female characters  but only rarely... and certainly not forced down our throats the whole time.btw  expect more cameos in kk s two projects   acolyte and skeleton crew  both of which have had problems  particularly with things that she tried to change.asoka and future series of mando will be much better... and gina will be back  despite kk s wishes.
disney execs   we re doing well with this star wars thing that all the nerds love.  how can we ruin that     take out the badass character that they all love because of woke nonsense that they don t agree with anyway     brilliant!
there were multiple reason why is mandalorian in state it is.. firing gina carano was maybe first one  and for me another was when they bring grogu back in bobf. whole bobf was stupid and leading to nothing... urgh.. maybe last straw  strow   was kenobi which killed all interest for sw in my case. i really liked andor  it was good thing  but too little too late. i have some curiosity for ahsoka  but i have no hypesw is han luke leia and vader. end of story
the end of season 2 was a natural break... even if it were in the middle of the story  it would be a time skip to grogu coming back as a trained jedi
gina! stop laughing!
thank you  _  can t wait to upload more videos  like 5-7 a week again. will be back to that after i finish up some stuff that s keeping me busy right now lol
@melonie mac go boom i can t wait for 5  videos to return  d but whether your videos are few or plenty  i m here to support ya through the ups and downs. and plenty of others are here to support you too
@otterloopb  faaacts!!!   sorry i m on my pre-workout
@lvthor ascending make those gains  bats!  d
@otterloopb  oh i have been!
if we view the mandalorian as a video game  the main story  s1   2  were great  the dlcs sucked ass   boba fett   kenobi   season 3 just kinda feels like we re in post-ending free roam now...
the third series is all in on the stupid. that alone is enough to cause the rating to power-dive of a cliff. shocking stuff  regardless of all other reasons for failure.
i agree about season 2. i think it was a perfect ending to the story. bobf was just boring to me. i didn t watch mando season 3 because i canceled disney plus. after what they did with their blatant racist writing in the proud family series  i decided i was done with disney  and i will not resub ever again.
one of the biggest turn offs for me about mandogina did a great job as cara dune and i really enjoyed her in the 1st 2 seasons  and the show is worse off without herjust one of many reasons that my boycott of disney keeps getting reaffirmed all the time
they had to change the story and bring grogu back because kathleen kennedy couldn t keep her gubby little hands off of it.
yeah   gina was awesome.  this season of mandalorian is boring as heck so far.  there s time for them to ramp it up  but so far it s kind of a snoozefest.
melonie  i love mando 1 and 2mauler  i disagree
with disney  the customer is always wrong.  that s why they re losing their customers.
one thing i don t hear talked about online but i have heard amongst friends is they are waiting to till it s all out to then watch. they felt burned by book of boba fett and kenobi and so the hype just died for most things star wars. it s the same reason they didn t watch andor.
gina is the reason why i loved the mandalorian.
the most recent episode was good in my opinion
for me  it s not actually due to gina carano s firing that drew me away from the show s return. it s the simple fact that it took forever to return and when it finally did  only one episode aired.  i simply lost interest. the firing of carano  didn t help much either. i think i m actually spent on star wars stuff now.  i need something with more substance. something with quality writing.
you might want to contact star wars meg. the mandalorian  is gaining viewers  overseas  on other platforms.
she should not have been fired but these poor numbers have very little to do with her.
i don t know why the viewership is tanking season 3 isn t too bad
firing carano hurt a lot more than they thought it would. mandalaorian was the one show i liked. i think kenobi and the other shows they ve released have sucked so bad a lot of fans have just checked out. another thing that i think always made star wars so special is it was extremely rare when you got a new movie. now they re coming out with all this woke crap that isn t star wars and fans have no desire to watch that crap.
or maybe because it took 2 years  and people  lose interest when you take that long for the next season i know i did still like it but not like i did after season  two final
disney s priority for the mandalorian is to sell baby yoda merchandise and provide filler content for d .
i quickly dropped disney  after they fired gina carano. i won t be sad if they go bankrupt.
i mean i enjoyed the most recent episode of the mandalorin the other 4 were ok but episode 5 was better and bad batch season finnaly was great
yeah she cant even act  like seriously
the number of fans that quit watching a series over a supporting character being fired i imagine equates to a rounding error statistically speaking. i would guess that the decline in viewership has more to do with the baby yoda hype dying down and the storyline moving in a direction that is unfamiliar to casual fans and amazing for people that watched rebels and the clone wars series. there s a lot of background in those cartoons that is 100  relavent to season 3. with that being said  no one knows the actual numbers  streaming viewership tends to be a hockey stick since a lot of people want to watch shows in chunks not a single episode a week and its still in the top 10 of all streaming shows...
i just read that gina s daily wire movie made all of  840. so there s a lot of laughing to go around.
not trying to be a bummer  but the new season is still awesome. i m not a fan at all of what they pulled on gina carano  but the show is still really cool. it is made by real star wars fans for star wars fans. check out the youtube channel of that  overlord dvd  doomcock guy. all of the lucasfilm whistleblowers have been going to him for years  he s like disney s project veritas  and they talk about how faverau and filoni have been trying hard to get her to come back behind kathleen kennedy s back. they re waiting out trying to get her back in until kathleen kennedy s contract is up. they didn t insult or kill off cara dune. i think she ll be back
they ended the show with the season 2 finale. it was great. now  any direction they go will be wrong.  the rescue  was the end. close the book. i m not interested in knowing what happens after. i don t want to know.
i like gina carano  but also i just don t feel interested or invested in the mandalorian anymore.i mean the first two seasons are  the mandalorian tries to reunite grogu with someone who can help him.  he then does this at the end of season  two.then they say  no no  we can t have them separate. we have to have grogu reunite with mando again.  completely nullifying the main goal of the entire series.
grogoo should have stayed with luke and they should have made mando a solo act again i mean they gave him a single person fighter that should have been it but kk didnt want it to retcon her awful sequels.
justice for gina!
never could get into gina caranos acting  didn t agree with her being fired but i didn t think she was integral to the story.
100  agree with your point of view here
spoiler warning  mando isnt even the main character anymore. in the latest episode  he only speaks to kreef carga  idk spelling  once in the entire episode. it s crazy that a mission to save his friend only has a single interaction with them and bo kotan makes the battle plan because of course.3 episodes left and this season has no real plot. has din djannin really accomplished anything  he doesn t have any goals.
loved two seasons  when they fired gina  i fired disney
it s because a lot like me waited until i only need to get 1 month service for the whole season. d  sucks beyond mando
all that struggle to bring grogu to jedi  and in the first episode of season 3  they said    sorry  we mocked you for two years   and mando take back baby yoda. than start the nonsense  the religious-like plot  with mando trying to rebuild a cult  cheap and boring monsters like in a sci-fi movie from 50 s  and the feeling that not even the screenplayers know where tho show is going. i quit at the second episode  and i m not a fan of gina carano  but she was one of the best part of the series
lmao thpuuuuuu i don t know why i did that. i laughed so hard   love ya melony you re amazing!
i don t know why i did that truer words have never been spoken...  prbbrpbprptptptrpbtprpb
i actually bought the first two seasons on dvd because i don t want to support disney wokeifying everything by having disney . but i do still want to support gina carano.
we don t forget. we don t forgive. pic related
to me season 1 and 2 are far from perfect  but so good they almost fit into the eu. that of course with a few fixes  since filoni is such a hack.
even worse  gina has never been as good as she was in mandalorian ever b4.her acting was always very limited before  in mandalorian she was acting more  than ever.going way past the other non-trained  actress    the one playing ahsoka in the mandalorian she was just herself  i couldnt see the character s traits https   www.youtube.com watch v ezcpv20l9ri anywhere .
i haven t given disney a single penny since they fired gina  callously and without justification.  walt would be rolling over in his grave  if he wasn t in a cryo tank somewhere.
well thats called a twist!
couldn t believe they canned corano. season 2 ending kinda wrapped up the grogo mando connection. at that point  they needed a new character for mando to connect with. bringing back grogo just seemed weird to me. haven t really had a desire to watch season 3. also  why the heck is a season premiere  for a company like disney star wars  only 38 minutes  stupid.
i like the third season the story round the tribe an bo katan is cool
you look extra beautiful today  melonie.
i think your the bomb ms. mack ! and disney has their hat in hand begging peeps to watch their crap. i get disney plus for free from my cellphone service so why i watch it still. it s meh
the real person that needed to be let go is pedro. keeping the helmet on helps!
tbh i ve not been enjoying season 3 as much because the show is called the mandalorian .and yet this season he s a literal side character more than ever before.
gina rules!
i enjoyed the 3rd season  katee sackhoff is awesome  that being said  shes no gina carano. however i am enjoying the mandalorian.
disney told us how they feel about us the employees said how they feel about us   so why would i want to give them my money knowing they hate me. plus they fired gina and put grogu back with mando
i think the problem is that they think the people who don t like their woke garbage are a minority. the reality is that the people screaming for the woke garbage to be in everything are a minority and probably don t even watch it either. it s become more entertaining to watch them burn  rather than to watch their shows.
i dont think mando season 3 is bad at all. episode 2 was meh but the other 3 so far have been great
losing gina was a huge mistake    not focusing on mando was the other    they needed all 3 to really make the story work but disney is full of idiots  wasting money that isn t theirs  but if disney doesn t see aproblem then they deserve to lose ratings.
so far season 3 is better than season 2 but i admit it would be better with gina carano. the reason for low ratings that is being ignored here is that it s been 2 years or more since the last season. people have short attention spans and lose interest.
a show about about toy stuffed animal can only go so far.
whatever was the magic or  the force  behind star wars  pixar and the mcu  disney really made sure to kill it all.
loved the first 2 seasons as well  season 3 has been meh so far
i have no complaints over season 3. she needs to get over it. move on gina. does anyone really think less people are watching because of her
i also enjoyed the first two seasons. it was boba fet that made me lose interest in season 3.
gina is a goddess. what where they thinking
i liked the first two seasons  and i like the bo katan character. i miss gina and i m not supporting s.3.
well  they did have a big hit with winnie the pooh last century. star wars is just like that  right
they should rename it to the shedalorian. ginger spice is clearly the one in charge.
as soon as disney fired gina carano  that was it for me.no  thanks.
the thpthpthpthtpppppp in the beginning set me off. i was laughing during the entirety of the video.thank you for making my evening
its not called womandalorian ! outrageous!
every episode reviewer keeps saying how what gina said was such a terrible thing  but every single one of them decide not to tell their viewers that their precious little pedro pascal also compared something innocuous to the holocaust on twitter. i m so tired of these hypocritical people singing pedro s praises  while shitting on a woman who was fired for doing exactly what he did. i m not a pedro hater  and i don t believe he needs to be fired too. i m just super into equal treatment regardless of the color of your skin  or other immutable characteristics.
they killed off a lot of goodwill that came with the cameo at the end of mando s2 with book of boba and kenobi.  plus forcing people to watch another show to get the necessary plot for the primary show is tiresome.  especially when it s a bad show like boba.
ooof. the viewership numbers for the third season were lower than for obi-wan kenobi. that s saying much.
it was doomed from the start when they used baby yoda to get cute points.
don t be mean. they worked really really hard to tank it  and they did it!
i m just saying  season 3 so far seems more like season 1 of the bo katan show instead of the mandalorian.i get it  bo katan was big in the clone wars but now  i don t care about her.  mando is becoming more and more of a side character in his own show.anyway .  my advice for disney  just rename the show to bo katan or return of the mandalorians.
if disney completely failed we would be better off. forcing a terrible values on others does not equal talent or entertainment. disney has lost it s way and there are a majority of more talented and interesting writers  actors and producers that are waiting to fill the void.
i feel the same  i have no interest watching season 3 too.
can star wars even be considered a great franchise anymore  it s become like the terminator franchise where the bad is far outweighing the great at this point. i m surprised that star war fans haven t just given up by now
season lll has been inconsistent  to say the least. at times  this show comes off looking like a nikelodeon production.
kathleen kennedy is likely leaving lucasfilm soon. at that point it might be possible to bring gina carano back. favreau will push for it. in any case  i can t wait for post kk star wars stuff  with or without gina. favreau is amazing. and what has happened with grogu is not favreau s doing. the people working on boba fett did that. grogu was supposed to stay with luke  and not favreau and feloni need to pivot.
after seeing how hopeless mando was in the first two episodes and how he kept being saved by the alpha female character... i checked out. thankfully i torrented it to begin with.
it would still suck if she was on the show or not
i wish mando was a bounty hunter again and not a babysitter. i m watching 3 as a sw fan but not on d
i dont get it does melanie think that gina carano carried the show
0 07  the best part of the video!
it sure sounds like that
i don t get it  did you comment before watching
@melonie mac go boom  with or without gina the show would be still tanking. get it now
as much as ronda rousey is carrying mk11.
they admitted they had to rewrite season 3 after they fired gina  that s why it s crap.i wanna see the superior earth-2 version of the season where she remained in the cast.
i stopped watching after season 2. and not even remotely had anything to do with gina. nothing against her  i m just not a fan. but the show was done. it was a great finale. and then they shit out book of fett and ruined it.they ve seriously had two f cking chances to create an awesome  bounty of the week  type show with two great characters and couldn t do it. just...amazing.
season 3 is big on pushing girlboss agenda.  din mando is basically a side character now.
with all this talk about cloning in both mando and bb  if anything gives me sequel vibes or sets up anything for those garbage films  im dropping both shows entirely!! they are walking on a very fine line here.
they basically said they have no  end story  line and all the episodes now are from the directors  perspective  that s why the whole story is such a mess they have no clue what to do about the story lol
tbh even from season 1 the mandalorian has always been a bit meh but ppl liked it because it was the best thing star wars had and even then it was bargin basement levels of good.
in my opinion the whiny actor should ve kept the helmet on throughout the series to keep with the feel of the mystery  only for a face reveal to happen like in season 2 finale.
i completely cut disney off after they abused gina  even though i liked a fair amount of disney s stuff.
the audience latches onto characters.  where would star wars  han solo be without the actor harrison ford   look at scooby doo s velma  radically changed for hbo max  and it isn t scooby any more.  you can change a popular character  but you have to be smart about it  and we don t see smart often enough.
is the show even about din djarrin
ooh  melonie s ethical content crisis emerges for a moment here...peaking out from mahogany curls...
for me  i stopped watching after they fired gina carano. i had absolutely no interest in watching anything lucasfilm after all that went down. then with disney going hardcore with their woke garbage  i completely cut them off. i will not watch anything disney related. and as it turns out  i haven t missed out on anything. but with the firing of gina carano  this is where it all started  for me.
well  i fired disney plus after they fired gina  so that s why i didn t watch season 3.
firing gina carano was definitely f @ked  and showed their true colors  but i  like many others  also felt mandalorian was over at the end of season 2. now with all the shit i m seeing about season 3  i m glad i haven t watched a minute of it. don t even have a subscription anymore. disney must be taught lessons about making content to appease their esg overlords.
personally i m just done with disney as a whole. i now actively look not to buy anything disney.
please  god clone this woman for all of eternity. amazing in so many ways and oh so gorgeous...
mandelorian was always a not so great series. with the terrible state of star wars  it was the starving man in the desert phenomena. the plot was a meandering video game quest logic  guy goes to npc  gets next step in quest to do a thing get a thing kill a thing in order to get the thing he wants needs  rinse wash and repeat . grogu was never appealing because he was clearly merch material. mando was budget boba fett  grogu was budget yoda. it really never did anything new for the franchise  never added to it  or anything of value. it came when lucas films was desperate for a win while flailing at the box office and at the cusp of covid shutdowns and disney . it has never really known what it intended to be and its continued meandering proves that.
season 3 has been a disaster on top of not having any gina in it. terrible writing  terrible directing  etc. they have made the mandalorians into absolute idiots. it s not been that good.
the 3rd season is the best season yet of any live action star-wars. and i ve seen it all....it just proves that high quality is never common for the masses.what numbers do you count   it s a streaming service. when people stop paying they ain t stop watching....
disney is just too distracted right now  what with their politics  fighting the state of florida with some really shady behaviour  whatever your politics  corporations never tell the people what to do  esp ones that celebrate the ccp  the demise of their parks  the overspend on the fox purchase  the list goes on and on.they need to get back to telling stories with well written  rounded characters if they want to make money.
book of boba fett was enough for me to not be excited about season 3 of the mandalorian
i mean  it s even more fundamental than that  there is like 5 or 6 new star wars stuff each year  people kinda get tired
i only watched the first episode of the new season and just by that not being anywhere close to the first episode of season 1 2 i think i m over it. and it just didn t look good like they got that kenobi budget
i loved this show but when they treated gina with absolute disrespect i will never watch it again until she is rehired  apologized to and kathleen kennedy is removed along with the rest of the individuals pushing  within  disney  for gina s firing.
i haven t had any desire to watch season 3 either. i didn t even finish kenobi. that show was terrible and killed whatever little interest i still has in sw.
i loved star wars because it was fast paced  with lots of action  but star wars now is very slow...a lot of talking about nothing.
i have a love hate relationship with this show. i feel it s the same for just about everyone. you want to love it  and half of it you do love. but the other half fills like over done filler for a low episode count show. you subject us to an incredibly boring boba fett show. it was so bad they had to include an episode for baby yoda and luke and include some mando. it felt like a glorified filler series. we finally get s3 and you do episodes like leaving mando s story for an entire episode to focus on former empire employees in some prison-lite camp story line that seems to exist to tie the sw universe to the sequels and the first order build up so that we in fact understand and are informed that those things will never go away. they will always be part of the sw legacy. forever. alot of content seems to make mando look like a clumsy idiot who constantly needs rescuing and can t seem to catch a break. baby yoda has turned into a chore more than anything. he s kind of just in the way. the scene with him doing battle with another foundling was comical. he s a baby of 50 years who can t speak yet but can understand direction perfectly fine. he s a functional being for all intent and purposes but still can t speak. at the rate he s going he ll be 500 years old before he s an adult. i guess tough luck to that race of beings. you hit adulthood and you re already having a mid life crisis and buying your first space sport ship that can reach 0 to hyperspace in 1.5 seconds. there s alot wrong with s3. i can honestly say 50  i like  50  i don t care for because it s meaningless to me or is pretty stupid. things that you expect from a fan production  not a major hollywood studio production  and star wars lucasfilm of all studios doing it. s3 feels like someone else s hands are all over it.
i love gina but i still love s3!!
i know you re dealing with a lot you can t talk about right now. i m praying for you  and i know you ll get through it and be stronger than ever. and you know i can t leave a comment without saying you are very beautiful
gina carano is one of the only woman in hollywood that looks like she give a punch and take a punch. other women look ridiculous fighting.
tbh i liked her character but i m not missing her that much in the show. this season has been awesome so far  so i m not really hurt she s gone
the absence of gina carano has nothing to do with the mandalorian going down hill. it has everything to do with the bad writing of john favreau. and to the people who say the story was over after season 2  you are blind as a bat. the story is over whenever the mandalorian culture is rebuilt. that s what the whole show is about  it was never about din.
would gina caranohave been a bettersupport actress..
i m not against a show continuing.  i m not against it as long as it doesn t suck like nearly everything does these days.  i ve said in other places i don t suffer from marvel dc fatigue.  i suffer from bad corporate ownership that wouldn t know a good writer if one offered to pay them to do a story.i wonder if that s part of the problem with mandolorian.  it s almost like they re throwing darts at a board with names on it of writers where 75  of them care nothing about the legacy  lore and respect for the ip where 25  of them do.  and then the writers throw a dart at board with story ideas on it where only 25  of them are remotely good.  it s like disney is laughing at fans begging to make things better while torching the magic kingdom.
gina carano s 6 fans are rejoicing. however the ratings are down because subscribers left after the absolutely horrible she hulk and m she u shows on disney plus.
i canceled my disney . i liked the first two season. hey melonie. you look great. hey everyone use code mac on gfuel.
i still enjoy season 3 but theres alot of issues with it  gina carno not being in it is defs a big one  budget seems to be another  the whole town gets evacuated because of pirates attacking and its only like 20 people....
i unsubscribed to disney plus after wakanda  forever. she hulk and thor love and thunder were almost the breaking point  which i only watching in total time between the 2 1hour. the new mandalorian season is ok  the story needs some work.
it s turning into the womandolorian. surprisingly enough they stuffed all the women they could find into the ahsoka trailer. is that white hair woman suppose to take the spot of mara
hi melonie you look great in goth gear and  thanks for liking my tweet
thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom
i see a reply and think maybe melonie is weighing in on what i said.  nope.  scammer.  when are you people going to figure out we re on to you.i was on to things like this even before the creators had to make announcement vids telling us to beware.  i m sure a lot of people were.  sigh    block and report.
don t blame ya lol  glad i never gave them a penny.
for me  the mandalorian season 3 is definitely the best season. it is at last the real first true star wars movie since g. lucas movies. it has everything. a good story  real star wars backgrounds and references  and apparently the right budget that goes with it.
im surprised because season 3 is actually really good
show became an add to sell baby yoda toys.
external politics aside   gina carano was not a significant presence within the show  so her leaving isn t a big deal from a story perspective. what is a big deal is the 180 u-turn on separating grogu from mando. easy to assume this is due to cynical studio interference to keep merchandise numbers high etc.  the moment they did that   the story became irreparably compromised and the whole show just exists now for merchandising and key jangling.edit  what s with all the simps here  sort yourselves out!
the masses dropping disney. good.
of course the numbers are tanking about watching the mandalorian without gina carano is still a bittersweet taste or a lot of us! and disney and lucasfilm thought we would just forget about what they did to her
gina s character wasn t even that important  they issue is not that she was kicked from the show  it s that they focus too much on side characters sometimes.
i don t know.  i want to watch new star wars stuff.  i keep wanting to cancel my disney   subscription tho.  i find it harder and harder to even rationalize where star wars might be going...
that s what happens when they don t bring gina back. 0 07 and that was cute.
has nothing to do with gina... well not directly. bounding into comics  you couldnt find an article that isnt ragebait season 3 is still strong. its still good star wars  still good story telling.... but its been 2 years from the end of season 2 to the start of season 3 and d  numbers have tanked. its not that the show s viewership has  tanked   overall has and its actually directly in line with that. however  the high seas viewship has gone up. according to piratebay s stats  and 3 other sites   its as high as it ever was.
literally 0 wokeness  and john favreau in control. the premier was pretty boring i will admit  but the last episode for the week of 3 29 was really good and pretty much every episode after the first one this season was good in my opinion. honestly i kind of had the same mentality of  where does the show go from here   seeing now it s about rebuilding mandalore is really giving me goosebumps  i love it. i give the season a b  so far.
too bad cause season 3 is the best anything star wars has put out in 20 years. i dont think the gina carano situation is playing too much into anything.
i stopped watching when the cringe monologues started rolling in this season. i am not stupid  i don t need to be told every mundane thing that is going on. show don t tell is an important rule of story telling.
can anyone explain why i was banned from the discord and the friends i made blocked me all because i asked for help  that s pretty screwed up it s not like i did anything bad i just simply asked for help. someone for goodness sakes say something so i can understand and let it in the past. watching the videos  it just doesn t feel the same knowing i ve been banned for something as simple as asking for help with a psn card. is that such a crime
disney has burnt the bridge to me. don t care what they do with the show.
disney did gina wrong  and that killed sw the rest of the way for me. i still have all my old sw books  if i get an urge to get some good star wars  i ll read them instead.
for me they should have just made the original trilogy and left it at that rather than put everybody through all this. it would have been good if lucasfilm had come up with an original idea for another sci-fi movie series for a new generation. my apologies melonie  a belated congratulations on becoming an auntie.
if you could be like martial artsfemalethere s  well kinda the new laura cruzmad azz tomb raiderlara croft
they should publicly apologize to gina .... and she should forgive them and come back.
i tried to watch it but when they mention her character got taken away by special forces i was like nah forget you guys and haven t watched since. it might be petty but as a customer i m allowed to be petty and vote with what i watch or don t watch. what i don t do is tell everyone else to boycott with me. that s a decision you make yourself. just saying think for yourself.
i feel like mando season 3 is failing because its premier was terrible - if season 3 started with the boba fett mando episodes  then it would a massive hit  everyone freaked out about the reappearance of luke in boba fett . if people saw the awesome opening episodes like that  they could handle episodes 3 4  which were kinda filler episodes . favreau is not to blame here though  kathleen kennedy forced the mando episodes to appear in boba fett - and favreau is actively fighting kennedy about her interference.
or not come back.
nah let it suffer
no don t ever forgive struggle snugglers
they ahould issue an apology and she should tell them to go fudge themselves you never forgive abusers
hahahhahahhaa. oh you are serious......hahahahahhaha
disney s ultimate goal is to change society. therefore it doesn t matter how much money is lost. they will ultimately affect the change they want.
bo katan  katee sackoff is the saving grace of the series. the rest is kind of meh.
there is alot of casual who love tlou show  like my cousin and his wife
the last of us is incredibly overrated.it could be that not enough people know how good the story in the 1st game was or that there isn t much competition   anything that isn t horrible seems like a masterpiece.probably both.it s just like the new d d movie is mediocre at best  but people are so starved for quality that it seems better than it is.
ive been watching it and i dont know gina carano firing had an effect  its just not that good  its ok  but thats it.
i loved the mandalorian in the first 2 seasons! cara dune was my favorite character and when disney s bigoted intolerance fired gina  i cancelled disney .  and without gina  i had zero interest in season 3.  if they d apologized and brought her back  i would have signed back up to disney  and watched the show.i think the season 3 ratings being light and day shows a lot of fans felt the same way.  i ve always been a big star wars fan and the only thing disney did with star wars that didn t suck was the mandalorian. but they found a way to make the failure 100 .  they can make an excuse that the ratings drop was because of the 2 year gap  but star wars fans aren t bothered by that.  there was more than a 2-year gap between the original trilogy and the prequels and they did pretty good.  and we re starved for something good from star wars!  it s about disney s wokeness and intolerance killing any franchise they take over.
honestly  i have no idea why people do not like the 3rd season  there is no difference to the 1st and 2nd season imo. also  i don t get it why episode 3 is almost hated. are people just din djarin fans and don t wanna know what happens in the sw universe  if so  these people shouldn t call themself sw fans but just djarin simps....
gina is so fine
the mythology is just stupid as hell  the mandos are incompetent warriors and who in their right mind thinks grogu is capable of becoming a warrior bounty hunter !it should have stayed a gritty self contained bounty hunter western. who cares about the og trilogy or the disney sequels just tell stories in universe  then cash the checks.but kk and team are incompetent  and mando became a kids abc after school special.it s kind of glorious watching disney burn  it s well deserved.
season 1 and 2 was watchable. not a fan but still  it wasn t that bad  until he took the bloody helmet off.not had any interest in s3 at all. its downloaded but meh. they finished it in sason2.
i really could care less i mean honestly i feel for gina carano and i m kind of glad that you know people disappointment and season 2 is being vocalized but so far i ve really enjoyed season 3 i feel like this is the direction the series needs to go in and. it s only going to pick up once word of mouth comes back around.
unpopular opinion  disney as a company is complete garbage. that being said  this season is good. it s about rebuilding the mandalorian society. i absolutely agree about gina  and maybe they are getting what they deserve  but objectively it continues to be the best live action star wars in a long time.  is it perfect  absolutely not. but it s pretty damn good. besides  star wars was never really top tier sci fi to begin with imo. edit- i watch it on the high seas  i would never fiscally support that degenerate pos company.
at this point  disney can burn. sorry walt
0 08 um  because you re a goof  loli m not big on the mandalorian but i enjoyed the first two seasons on their own merit for the most part and gina did a good job in her role  she didn t deserve what happened to her. disney star wars has reaped what they ve sown. i ve got plenty of star wars material to keep me entertained from the classic movies  games  comics  etc so i don t need any of the new stuff
that first episode did not grab me so i haven t gone back since.
some of the same ppl laughing at how ridiculous ppl are acting for boycotting a game over the author are using the same energy over a whole show.. as a man of principle i have to speak on it... no sides taken
i actually prefer the story this season around. i feel like the story actually has a direction now. they were kind of feeling skeptical if this would actually get popular. and then the woke disney issues  including the gina fiasco  got people to cancel subscriptions.
gina  flip flopping story  and kathleen meddling.
only far right trump extremists are this upset at gina being fired. i liked her character  but she was way out of pocket and bringing negative attention to the show. it was her choice to change into some political activist as soon as her fan base started growing. you really turned against a whole show because she supported your political beliefs  how lame.
i quit watching when they fired gina carano  now we know why they are trying to bring her back.
the first game was super generic.
no we re not. you don t see me telling people to boycott  or calling anyone who watches is a bad person.
@melonie mac go boom  this is more so based on some of the comments down below.. i definitely cite your statement of not checking for it at least for now and i respect that   but some of these commentators are smearing the whole show moving forward and the comparison to hogwarts is a great comparison.
love your hypocrisy of boycotting the mandalorian but mocking people who boycotted hogwarts legacy
sins of children are from parents -- understanding your parents helps you understand others. woke is needed or 2030-2060 hell even worse.
the show is still great people just love whining but i do wish they would bring back gina i mean the story of star wars is redemption and forgiveness maybe we follow suit
i refuse to watch it after they kicked gina to the curb
after they fired gina carano  i canceled disney plus. that was it for me. i did not want to give them anymore money or support their crappy products. i have no desire to watch anymore disney star wars.
iliked session3...
i cancelled my subscription after they fired gina carano  and never looked back.screw disney.
at this point i m just waiting for that evil empire that is disney dies.
i still watched it though
mandalorian season 31 weak2 ok3 weird  weak4 ok
death cert for disney  cause was brain dead
yay melonie !
mac attack!
laughs in never equating my  suffering through covid  to - checks notes - the holocaust
2 issues  there are less people watching it  those that are watching it only watch it once.  when i viewed season 1 and 2 i rewatch them.  season 3 i have no needed to rewatch.  ep 3  was long and bad or very boring.

i just tried to choke down season 3 last night  made it to 3rd episode then i turned it off
i am so glad i never bought disney stock ! not buying anything from them until the mouse is caught and the place is rodent free
forcing  easter eggs  in every episode instead of quality content story-line doesn t help.
kwasade for the algorithm.
i mocked people who told others to boycott    not hard to know the difference
now to top it off they returning rey palpatine. star wars is dead  and now they are staring to dig their graves.
what you like to use your imagination  good for you. hahaha  and remember to drink water.
i watched mandalorian because of gina. after they fired her i canceled everything disney.
everyone told me to watch this show  but i been star war fatigued at this point and don t care much about it.
you ve been boycotting disney  for 2 years over gina  in that time disney gained 100 million subs  its bundle overtook netflix  analysts project d  alone will overtake netflix in a few years  they won the streaming war in record time. but you ignore all of that and zero in on a dip in ratings for a show on disney     are we coping again
her career is still in the crapper though. lol
should have kept gina carano
the black girl was a villain. that complaint was ridiculous.
hahahahahahahahaha!
there s only one way to save disney...fire kk .now!!! ...not tommorow....righy now !! ....
i probably would have like the gina carano seasons  but the last three star wars mo is left me just not really that interested in star wars.
using  the imagination  is too much for current audience.
yarr matey  join me on the high seas to stick it to those dirty disney scallywags
thank god she can t ruin it anymore!
all i could think when i was watching was   did they even try   there were cell phone quality scene transitions  youtube quality special effects  even worse acting than previous seasons  just absolute garbage you can tell by watching season 3 that disney is bleeding money like an open carotid artery
amen to that
i canceled my disney   subscription when the misogynistic marvel ceo fired gina carano.  disney is like an abusive husband that slaps the living hell out of his wife if she dares to think for herself.  disney was a sadistic abuser towards gina carano   there is no excuse for the savage bullying disney attacked carano with simply because carano dared to have an opinion as a woman.
i was only interested in cara dune with her gone i just don t care anymore.
lol why would you make the fans happy when twitter is so good for us.
i mean im a supporter of gina s situtation with mando but idk where ur getting ur facts from saying that mandos season 3 is dieing its been a really great season so far. disneys murdering anything they touch yes but mandos still killin it. the only reason for the success it does have i give credit to john favreau  but do not get me wrong. i do not support disney and they will get not my moneys till they knock it off. there are other ways to watch mando that some may consider to be unnatural  p
i m all about baby yoda anyway the rest doesn t matter
i miss america i miss the days when you d hear people say it s a free country nobody gonna say that in the future
dinsey hates everybody
please do not hate watch anything disney!please  just avoid their garbage.
when gina was fired  i cancelled my disney   subscription  and have never looked back.this from a guy who owned over a hundred star wars novels and all of the movie dvd s  other than  rise of skywalker   which was so bad i did not buy the dvd .bye bye  star wars.  i cared about you a lot more than disney does  sadly.
ya love to see it!
commenting to feed the algorithm
the last of us was so mid. i only finished watching it because my wife and i were watching it together. i won t watch season 2.
dang.
i watched it  and s.3 is not good. this season is the epitome of mid
go woke go broke
how much money did her last movie make again
it s funny  the sole reason i m not watching season 3 is purely due to the way they treated gina and the fact that padro tweeted some horrible stuff. oh and i agree the last of us is over-rated. i found it just boring.
hey pretty melonie  i never saw mandalorian to be honest im not interest in star wars spin off like andor etc so sure it seems last season of mandalorian  suck also yoda clon  has a crapy  name remind me the name of avenger tree guy.
gina aside  that s too bad i m actually enjoying the season but as usual everything kk touches turns to shit
her part was cringe af too  as if she could go hand to hand with a man lol. nobody watched the mandalorian because of her.
no gina carano no disney plus subscription
starwars is dead if i want to watch starwars ill go back and watch the original.
bring back bill burr
i m not bothering to watch season 3 because i m done with the  baby yoda  bullshit.... it s a storyline that should be over and done with for now but they keep dragging it on.....
throoop flooort phwaaarbpt i just purchased another crystal og xbox modchipped. old one quit but easy repair apparently. omg im so happy. new one 2tb origins mod holy heck.. golden age back when things mattered . emulates amiga n64 etc wow... glorious beautiful masterpiece. much better than my og mod when lcd flat screens were just taking off.my og crystal modchip was 160gb. 20 years ago lol. had to hire from video store games to copy. this will be so beautiful treasure. come play monopoly wit me lets snuggle under the blanket partydoll. burnout 3 etc daaang
i stopped watching after they fired gina. disney is just flopping so hard
i ve been hating disliking all thing disney  sadly  mandolorian has. been only good hit for me. i wanted to skip due to carano firing and fill guilty watching this season
just like cnn  disney  etc etc.... oh wait... budweiser s about to see the same...
can you spell   summarize
yep  i stopped watching when they pushed gina out.
whenever i see some ladies they looks like a rat trapped in the corner just trying to fake smiles and afraid being caught out its really weird not natural at all. just sayin. goodnight nevermind
season 3 woke writing speaks for itself.  its rubbish.
star wars and marvel died when disney acquired them.
the average person couldn t care less what happened with gina carano. it s just a boring show
this show would have gone downhill with or without her.
...grrl  you all 9s today  huh!!
the first last of us game is also overrated not just the show.
season 3 just feels like all fluff filler with zero substance and no direction whats so ever. there is no comparison between season 1 vs season 3  its like a totally different show now. all watered and dumbed down from an adult-ish show it started as to something now that looks like its geared for 7 year olds.. this show has been m-she-u d  and wrecked..
thanks!
wow head hypertrophy  serious
go bing bong
well gina s character is officially dead  y all can thank k.k. who fired gina and gina pissed off jon and jon killed her character off in the pirate episode  prison transport  and k.k. is officially gone star wars 2023 in uk is k.k. vikings funeral and allllllllll of the bs she has caused especially killing off indiana jones and replace ford by erasing indy s character by the female assistant who was to replace the main character and turn him into a her and that indiana jones disney  show has been completely trashed by bob and bob gave jon full car blanch to fix the star wars franchise and he will be introducing grand admiral thrawn into the mix and it should be seen in the next few episodes of mandalorian season 3if you look at the very beginning of the title with the helmets from season 1 and 2 you ll see the same helmet if you get season 3 there s a few missing - meaning that jon is removing the last 3 star wars shit show that i grew up with! i m 50 born in  74 so i was there for all the openings for those long lines back in the day! so jon is again killing off the last 3 film s 7-8-9 are going to scrubbed and in 24 there will be no star wars celebration but there will be one 25! this swc23 is kathleen kennedy s n sync bye bye bye don t let the door hit her flat ass on the way out!!! she does have a twin sister who is in the unreal gaming company so there s still one kennedy out there!  volume stage  so the rangers are officially back and timothy will be apart of that and acolytes is dead - not officially yet but will be soon! disney doesn t want anyone who helped and worked for harvey weinstein s personal assistant who walked all the female victims to harvey himself in his offices at miramax! so everyone on the production side is going to be fired and permanently be blackballed!!! so be patient and wait!!!! if you don t believe me i don t care!!! but i am telling y all the truth! go back and look at title helmet s intro from season 1 2 and go watch seasons 3 opening helmet shot there is no kylo ren!!!! for all my rebels and remaining hidden jedi there is hope coming do not be easily swayed to the darkness of the dark side by k.k. and all her bs! never give up never surrender!!! galaxy quest!!!admiral thrawn is coming very soon to a galaxy near you all!!!
i really dont think gina carano is the reason  most people  except her fans  didnt even like the character  she added nothing  no chemistry no interesting story she should of been an odd  character who shows up every now and again like bill burr s mayfield  the reason the shows numbers have gone down  only a little not tanked as your clickbait tilte would suggest  is because people are bored now of grogu and are a little annoyed how the whol training thing ended so quicklyfor those wondering the numbers are just under 1.5 million households in the us only. this is comparable to 2.08 million who tuned into the season 2 premiere us only  or the 2.14 million that watched ewan mcgregor s premiere so yes  tanked  is full on lies and the lower viewership has zero to do with crap actress gina
everything sucks but andor was amazing
if you watch tlou you are cringe. just watch the first game and leave it be. the sequel just ruins everything good about the original.
the last of us show is extremely over rated and yes it is woke as hell. that  what is woke@ video i m sorry but it revealed the grifter s  on this calling out the car left  political woke garbage. i noticed immediately who was the person who sounds like he d have voted biden. melonie done be pressured please a lot of people i know hated the show especially after episode 3. no one not even chicks want to see two pasty old dudes making out and the whole premise was absurd. oh man the apocalypse and the rarest of rare sexual identity is wandering in my gay backyard yay!! like wth okay me and my bro groaned and changed it because we saw it coming. no zombies in the show just gay crap  human drama  and neil cuckman thinking he should take credit for last of us 1 when he had very little to nothing to do with it. his work was last of us part 2.
bloook of blooobla  poisoned the well and season 3 started with terrible borring episodes that are so stupid  .......
@meloniemacgoboom
i ditched d  over gina  but even if i hadn t  i ve heard about all the rotten star wars content since.  no  thank you.
just give up on disney   i have  there not worth it moved over to manga   bye bye hollywood
stopped watching when they fired her
i m not watching because i unsubscribed and i m not resubscribung for mando  which got retconned by having luke hand grogu right back to mando in another show. what a stupid move that was  so many people were happy to see luke  only for them to go   ah  you know what  nevermind.  what a joke.
mando season 3 is garbage and tlou tv show is severely overrated... not good!
not a fan of gina so i can t say i cared about her getting fired
when gina carano was fired for no reason that was it for me.  nobody cares.  star wars is dead.
it had last jedi shit in it  i m done
i ve lost literally all interest in star wars. it s just soulless content now.
no more gina  no more mando.
i canceled my d  right after they treated gina horribly and i haven t looked back. everything that has come out since is horrible lore breaking trash.
yeah hey chicky babe. first two seasons were average at best 3rd season only watch 3 apps didn t make sense. the last of us episode 3 two gay guys episode 4 all about a death kid episode 5 interracial marriage and communism. episode 6 evil religion blah blah blah but the story was good gotta get that bulshit in. cheers from oz
has zero to do with gina lol
yes it has nothing to do with gina. the break they took to run bobf hurt season 3 imo. but i just watch all 5 between yesterday and today and it s not bad at all.
and the obi-wan kenobi show didn t help either.
the season is so crap.
i wish i had taken your path and avoided this season. it has been awful. pointless  moronic  uninteresting. and the ultimate insult i save for last  thru 5 episodes  i don t want to rewatch any of them. one and done!
pathetic constant push of baby yoda to attract fans ..not me..
but shes just a side character.  an npc   makes no sense why they get excited.  i mean she desirves to be fired lol.
gina carano fans inconsequential character  crappy acting. am i missing some  is this a wrestling thing
this video is incredibly disingenuous  unfactual  and flat out biased. there a million factors and variables that aren t being talked about in this video  and it s pure propaganda bs - people with an audience need to do better.
you know right wingers hate gina carano  because shes a woman right lmao
the kenobi series killed star wars for me   they took a flagship and made it into a trash collector. star wars needs to be buried and forgotten  it will never be good again.

dude season 3 suckssssssssssss. its so freaking bad!
havent watched a single episode. not going to. they mistreated gina. book of boba ended up being bullshit lame and ruined the whole luke thing. i m done with live action star wars
the last of us is severely overrated. subpar show. just hyped up to all hell because of the actors and the lgbt stuff.
i will not watch it solely because communists kicked out gina carano  for pointing out the obvious. a shame as it was one of our favourite shows with my wife.
i do not feel sorry for gina carano firing it was her fault. melonie just mad the the over rated show the last of us is doing fantastic numbers woman grow up and stop complaining like a whining child.
gina carano looks like very nice and genuine warmhearted person. she was fired  because she state some objective facts in post on social media site.  beiing fired for telling the truth  is her fault  how many people acctualy read her post not only juicy headlines
@kara   oh well the must go on. this is the way . by disney
