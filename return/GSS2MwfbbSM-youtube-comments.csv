this might sound a bit weird  especially since it is off topic for this video  but Im glad I found this channel on a spiritual level. for the past several years Ive been struggling with my faith  not my beliefs necessarily  but facing down and coming to grips with my own lack of conviction. Ive had to own up to my failings and face my  demons  on a deep personal level and honestly felt that I wasn t really worthy of the title of Christian. recently a very close friend started asking me at the end of each week to come to church with him and I finally ran out of excuses  between he and his wife s gentle insistence and seeing more of the commentators I watch or listen to  like your channel and a few others  find or profess their faith openly I was finally motivated to take him up on the offer. I still feel a bit out of place to a degree  like a stray dog that just happened to wander in  but reconnecting with my faith has brought me a level of peace and calm that I haven t felt in many years. sorry for being long winded  I just wanted to thank you for being one of the positive influences in this space.

@melonie mac go boomÂ   youre welcome and thank you. seeing someone my own age with the level of faith and energy that I used to have really drove it home. keep spreading the good word  it really helps .

I used to be an athiest  before I decided to become Christian. I still have to be baptized so I am not quite Christian yet  but I am working towards it. thank you for sharing  God bless!
