hey mel  hope you and your pup and kitty are doing well.  its thanks to you and the quartering among others that help keep my faith in a brighter tomorrow.

Im not very religious but hearing your interpretations and scripture bits... idk it probably isn t everyone s thing but as the only one in my circle with some faith  its nice to hear you talk about it. its nice to see someone else who likes what I like and also thinks what I think. its probably not for everyone but I sincerely hope this channel never stops growing. its so nice that you ve built this little community of like minded ppl. with the way the world has been  its so great to have your based channel as it makes ppl like me feel heard

keep watering your new channel with fresh prayers and it continue to growing. you will also see a big yeald! your friend and prayer warrior out here in the great county of lancater  pa. better known as amish country.

hello  just subscribed.  it was a wonderful surprise to find a Christian behind the mic covering topics of interest to me.  Ive been on kind of a youtube anti-woke content binge since the release of a wheel of time on that....one...woke streaming service I wont mention.Im sure other creators are Christians as more and more people get red pilled and I see things like a.j. making an appearance on nerdorotic and hear him mentioned in places like the knights watch streamers.  a.j. has thatshow i.w. that you can only view on his website.  you have a large community surfing the internet looking for this exact content. so congratulations!  I will secretly classify you as my favorite since you are an open follower of Jesus.

you are even more of an inspiration now! keep the good fight going and rocking the word of God!as for those gizmodo media people on strike  I know not all of them are bad but  with their reputation it just looks like a bunch of  self-important  useless people asking for more money for just existing.I am interested in the carnivore diet. right now I still take in way to many carbohydrates  white rice is my kryptonite . I hope to work up the courage and discipline to take that first step and keep it going. I feel I optimistic with you and Jesus helping. stay safe and God bless!

as a fellow Christian and a transgirl  I get so much crap for doing the same thing of keeping up on my Bible study  etc. but it does the same for me. it helps with all the stress and keeping me centered.

I love that Bible verse!  its so wonderful to know that God cares about whether or not we get a good good night s rest.  it makes me happy.

@melonie mac go boomÂ  also  thanks for being polite in your response. most people in the comments have forgotten that art.
