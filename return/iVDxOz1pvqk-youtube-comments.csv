tbh I really enjoy the verse at the end. Im pretty lost spiritually at this moment in my life and idk but I definitely look forward to hearing them every day. please keep it up  its a very nice touch

some melonie mac before bed is always a good thing  I cant help it you are visually aesthetic. keep going and dont let the woke mob ruin your walk with Christ  never take the easy way out.

melonie I happened across your channel by accident and I think its awesome that you do a Bible verse of the day. Im an old fart and you give me hope that the wokies aren t going to win.  stay true to your faith.

being a Christian  more center politically  and a causal gamer. your channel is a good watch.

Im a newer subscriber  but thank you so much for being one of the few sane voices on the internet in a flood of hypocritical  woke  bullies. I know its easy to be discouraged when you get attacked on a daily basis  but you are making a difference. stay feisty  stay outspoken  and continue to push back against all the insanity. thank you melonie!

thank you for creating this space melonie and sharing your thoughts.
