daphne  had intuition empathy velma  had intelligence fred  had leadership shaggy scooby  had comedy
our daphne is different because we gave her trauma  lesbian parents  and possibly made her part of the lgbtqia  community because no one can be interesting or have character without one of these!  honestly daphne was such a great character for me growing up. she showed me that it was okay to be feminine because it didn t demote me in any way.  she was empathetic but knew when to stand up for her and her friends. she was a great role model for little kids.
Im so tired of my childhood faves being ruined. I related to velma and daphne equally because I loved books and girly things. Im saying this as a woman of color who was born to immigrant parents. a pup named scooby doo and 13 ghosts are my favorites. velma was bookish but daphne was wise and worldly. also I dont need the race swapping to make me feel good about myself. Imight be insane  but I grew up relating to people for more reasons than their skin tone. yes of course I love my culture and cultural foods and loving sharing that with others  but that is not the only reason to relate to another person. scooby has never been problematic  I wont be watching this and the og characters will always define my childhood.
uh  did they forget daphne came from a very wealthy family  who is a karate champion and badass with family members all around the globe and whose roots go to scotland and the fact thatshe has many incredible connections with people all over the world
daphne was the character who made me appreciate being a girl when I was young. she was pretty  well dressed  socially smart and had street smarts. she was also open-minded to everyone. she came from wealthy parents who were supportive despite her choosing different interests than they wished. why must they ruin everyone !
Ive been rewatching the original scooby doo show. it had been many years and  of course  I expected to see daphne as simply a pretty damzel in distress. and  although she does get captured a lot  she is also solving parts of the mystery and will even insult the bad guys. when she is captured  it isn t typically for very long. and if she is  she often notices something about the one s  who captured her. I have been learning thatshe was actually quite smart and witty in the old show. but somehow  everyone only remembers her as needing to be rescued and wearing purple.
I seem to remember daphne having a wide array of knowledge that helped keep the group from imploding. everything from replacement clothes to lock picking skills. and wasn t she a rich and privileged girl who could literally have everything she wanted but chose to go full hippie and live a life of adventure  she successfully combined controversial elements and carved her own path. she was unafraid and smart. she was more level headed than freddie and had the social smarts that velma lacked. the group wouldn t be able to function the way they did if it wasn t for daphne - she s the only reason they weren t chased off with brooms everywhere they went and she was naturally curious  hard working  and could put two and two together.
she was a rich socialite that reached beyond her gilded cage she could have languished in being given everything she ever wanted and went on the road with her friends and solved mysteries.  she was brave and consistent.  this is super sad.
y all probably dont remember this  but daphne was nicknamed  danger-prone daphne  in the original series  all of the crew had their own strengths and flaws. scooby and shaggy were complete cowards until they ate scooby snacks. velma was the brains of the operation but she d occasionally get caught or otherwise get herself into trouble. fred was the leader and man of action  but his complex plans to trap the ghost monster whatever often went awry  particularly because daphne tripped  knocked something over  etc. daphne  fred  and scoob found the clues and velma figured them out. no need to  fix  or change any of the characters  they were just fine as they were.
they cant even  woke  right.  thatstatement made me laugh harder than itshould.
my memory of the og version of daphne  she had access to information that the rest of the gang didn t have. she had some lock picking skills with bobby pins  fashionista   she had various knowledge of highly priced items even if they re obscure  she could tell high quality items from low  i.e. gold  gems  etc . she had a lot to offer if you bothered to get creative enough - too bad they couldn t be bothered.
the part where velma shouts  I am the storm that is apprroooochhhhinnngg!!!  gave goosebumps and caused me to velma ed all over my tv screen for 69 days. truly one of the shows of all time
this pisses me off because daphne did have a lot of lore in the old scooby doo. her mom and dad were rich and wanted her to live the high class life and go to school  she wanted to be a model but liked mystery solving and her dad helped them get mystery inc off the ground. these woke people have never watched or liked any of the old scooby doo incarnations.
daphne is the brave one. she is curious and goes looking for clues in the face of danger. hears a thud alone in an empty library  what was that  let me go investigate.
daphne actually has a lot of depth thats why she s a favorite. she let fred act like the leader  but it was really her.  and velma may be the nerdy girl but she was cute. they totally took her cuteness away
the thing is  daphne has depth  it has been explored more recently with scooby-doo mystery incorporated. she s learned self defense. I believe there was a whole movie or episode based on her going to a judo or karate tournament based on her skill level. she can be very resourceful and with mystery incorporated  she showed girls you dont have to stay in a relationship with someone just to spare their feelings. she broke up with fred in thatseries and maintained that boundary until she felt they could have a better relationship . she isnt velma smart  but she has value as she was  she has depth as she was with rich entitled parents who tried to keep her away from people they considered undesirable. and each time she fought their influence and forged her own path.
scooby doo is my number 1 childhood cartoon. hell  its pretty much the reason I wanted to learn english because there was a time when cartoon network was entirely in english in my country for some reason. I didn t understand a thing but many cartoons caught my interest and especially scooby doo. the spooky locations  the ridiculous mysteries with monsters that always turned out to be not real - and the gang. shaggy and scooby  two scaredy cats with bottomless stomachs  velma thatseemingly knew everything  fred with his traps and daphne who often happened to have  or stumble onto something useful. they have a special place in my heart and I would never sully it with these  modern  takes. thanks but no thanks. I d gladly rewatch the old shows instead.
this is so sad. especially since daphne went through the most character development throughout the years.in the original  she was the danger prone damsel in distress  but that concept hasn t been used in years.in 13 ghosts and new scooby doo mysteries  daphne was the leader of the gang in fred s absence.she was basically mcguyver in what s new scooby doo. being able to pick locks and create devices with random everyday items.in sdmI  daphne lived with 4 overarching sisters. making her seem like the black sheep of her family in my opinion.and I personally loved her silly random personality in be cool scooby doo  where she would do something random every episode. and finally she s a black belt in the live action movies and some video games.long story short  hbo had so much potential with daphne but made her seem so inaccurately one dimensional.
they dont understand scooby-doo characters. shaggy needs scooby-doo. daphne is more than a face  she is the heart of the group. she is there for everyone. fred is the leader  the trap guy  and the one willing to put himself on the line for the gang when in danger. velma was smart  calculating  but also emotional. she was far from than just a nerd  and developed into a real character with really motivations and real depth was amazing. and shaggy needs scooby-doo because scooby-doo is the person that keeps him going. if scooby got kidnapped  shaggy didn t care how terrifying the situation was  he would go after him. shaggy would tell his fears to fuck off if scooby or the gang were in danger. this is terrible. they really dont know shit about scooby-doo
I think you are totally right about that artwork. one looks like really in depth art and the others look a bit more plain. like two different artists drew them and I have a theory on that. maybe one artist team made the normal looking characters but the show runners changed and then they hired someone to make new versions of 3 of the 4  new more diverse versions . I have a strong feeling based on just how different the art is that this is what happened. of course just a wild theory but I would not be surprised.
exactly  and thats why we loved them!
and heart.they all have heart.
exactly they are more than the sum of ther parts. why spinoffs with only shaggy  scooby-doo  and scrappy weren t as great
exactly  they were a mishmash of personalities and they worked together to solve mysteries.  each with their own strength.  but then everything changed when the hbo attacked.  I think it kinda funny in a sad tragic way that  to make daphne more relatable  got rid of her empathetic and intuitive personality... I suppose they had to do itso they could make her like the people who wanted that change.
youre insanely coping if you thought daphne had a character especially  intuition empathy
@c i  well scooby and shaggy are an iconic duo regardless. even some shows or episodes where they re left to their own devices can be fun  but its just the best with everyone.
dont forget  traps expert too.
shaggy  hadn t fallen asleep on the beach
@c i  but even the spin-offs with scrappy are better than this.
@quipsilvervr  I like how you said  the hbo attacked  I found that hilarious.... and absolutely right
it is saddening how so many new female characters from hollywood or big corporations view femininity as wrong or demoting. daphne was my favorite because she was feminine and strong. I hope there will be more good feminine role models for all kids without telling them that its wrong or degrading to be feminine.
the writers must be projecting their own life struggles into daphne.
I read this comment before watching the video and I legitimately thought this was a joke.
those all make her  diverse .
yes  she was feminine and a black belt.
dang. if you got all that from a predictable cartoon then where were the parental figures
lmfao
lol every time I see lgbt pop up it keeps getting more letters wtf.when will they stop
shaggy and scooby actually  accidentally  solved most of the mystery. the stoner and his dog!
@ichangednametoamorecringyone  I find it hilariously ironic that their idea of empowering women is making them more masculine
@gh0st  what is the correlation  between what was said and your replylmaooo  its quite obvious  that you do not know much about animation  about how writers use clever writing to include things only teens and adults can seeits just like tom and jerry  to a kid it may just be a dumb show  but as you grow older there are alot of life lessons you could learn  number one being  how people from different  backgrounds  can actually  become friends  we all know cats eat mouses. its sutter  unrealistic  and clever  but has great messaging.also all the suttle adult rated jokes that would fly over kids heads.people that do not understand  animation always make me laugh  and these are the people taking over the shows.also scooby-doo had various iterations and was not just a dumb cartoon  which also had  various life lessons.lmao  same thing with cinderella  loin king and a whole host of shows
the  fix her  type of mindset is destroying women. turning them into bitter misandrist feminists that men dont find attractive. these women are the ones who end up middle aged and alone in a house or apartment full of cats. I see women complaining all the time on social asking questions like  what happened to the good men   or  where are the men that hold open doors  pull out chairs and bring flowers   we are being chased away by what society is doing to women.  daphne is an example of what is now looked down upon. femineity  need for a man  and sex appeal have all been demonized nowadays.
what s the qia stand for
@brian smith  its the same shit with she-hulk as well...
@vasI pescu  . thats why they put the plus sign     at the end. to include whatever nonsense that they keep cranking out.
@that guy with the face
@gh0st  there s more than four shows my guy and like more than 30 movies.
@jacksixterror  the I is for intersex  q for queer  short for genderqueer nonbinary   and a is asexual. I think.
the sad joke is that daphne s femininity is only a  problem  because she is a woman. fred and shaggy would be celebrated if they were to dress  act  identify  and present exactly the way daphne does.
what do the I and a do
@legate rikke   a  is for asexual  which means they dont experience sexual attraction   while the  I  stands for intersex.
thats why some refer to them as alphabet people  cause they re going to have the whole damn thing soon. ironic as the   is supposed to be a catch all for any missed category. God forbid the narcissists dont get their own letter though.
ia
yes- skin color is waay overblown. I loved levar burton of reading rainbow because of our mutual passion for books. also because he was a sweet star trek character who overcame his handicap.  not because he physically looked like me
op I loved pup named scooby-doo and I even have the plush my sister let me pick out for a birthday gift
Im an asian gypsy  who grew up surrounded by white people in eastern europe. the only asian I knew and saw irl that is not me was my dad and thats it. I was surrounded by whiteness from everywhere and Ive never in my life thought that there s something wrong with me. I used to  and still do  relate to characters no matter what colour of skin they had  because kids just dont care about that! I dont need characters that weren t asian to be swapped to being asian  that is just insulting. Ive never picked asian characters to be my favorites just because they re asian  it would be just stupid. my favorites were my favorites because of their traits  skills  personalities. because this is actually important. this should be the most important things in a person. not the colour of their skin or the shape of their eyes. judge them based on what kind of people they are  not based on their race! people used to fight for not being identified by their race  and look at us now...
true true and true!!
I love my culture and sharing it with others too. thats the joy of living on a planet so full of diversity  with so much to learn  and see  and experience..a homogeneous world would be boring and ignorant. the way things are going its going to reach a point where you can only play beethoven if youre german  mozart if youre austrian  hang van gogh prints if youre dutch  wear tartan if youre scottish..but  more to the point  daphne sends a really strong message  that a book should not be judged by its cover. there s still a societal notion that pretty   dumb or stupid  which is a message that is universal to girls all around the world  so to make it offensive to be something genetics created  to actually play into a stereotype by positively reinforcing it  which seems to be what s happened here  is not enlightened  its bizarre.
@condor crow  one little thing you were surrounded by caucasians  not whites. and people differ  country to country  ethnicity to ethnicity. so growing up in eastern europe would be foreign to an outsider  regardless. but  you dont refer to yourself as a yellow  in fact  thats a type of generic racism that I thought was long gone. you are asian  I am caucasian. what I am really is the living  breathing surviving end result of millenia of wars  famines  plagues  invasions  persecution  power struggles  the rise and fall of civilisations  poverty  immigration  emigration  and the sheer tenacity of the human race to survive. all of which contrived to send my gene pool off to the antipodes some centuries ago  and makes me a little bit of everything. the fact that any of us are here it all amazes me.
@virginia viola  well  youre right  its just that we dont call white people caucasians here. for us  people who grew up in eastern europe  caucasians are the people from the caucasus region - armenians  georgians  azerbaijanI  southern russians  etc. and the people that you call caucasians  we call europeoids. and thats how they re called scientifically in our country. its just a cultural difference  there s nothing more to it  honestly.it feels weird for me to call white people caucasians for the reason I just explained  but people wouldn t understand me if I said europeoids. so I decided to say  white people  without thinking too much about it. maybe it was a mistake  I dont know. but Im sorry if I said something wrong.and youre absolutely right about how amazing it is that we re all existing now  after that long of a journey. I generally dont like to think about it because I feel a lot of pressure because of it. I keep thinking that it could ve been someone better and more deserving in my place instead of... well  me.
omg yes  thank you! very well said! yes  you can find elements and characteristics about a character that make them relatable to you. whether its a struggle they re going through  a character strength or flaw  skin colour is just a surface-level thing. just goes to show how these types of people think  their understanding of  representation  is very superficial and not meaningful.

I especially loved seeing her get taken held captive.
@princess marlena  what
@condor crow   what
even the 2002 live action movie where daphne fought that big guy and said she s not a damsel in distress wasn t as cringeworthy
@c i  yes it was......
@princess marlena  xd
@c i  because it was part satire and part truth. try being daphne who has plenty of social and to a point street smarts and beautiful and always 8 out of ten times being tricked or kidnap to a point a normal person will be tired of thatso it made sense she would spend her time away from her friends improving herself aka martial arts lol Imiss normal stories like that
its like a new hollywood rule now that if something is popular and a fan favorite-  change everything about it and trash the fans if they complain.
amen! like I know I relate to people through food  and southern food regardless of race. I was taught to relate to people on who they were on the inside! I hate it when they change people for no reason in these things. laugh  love  make friends  hang out around a campfire  watch cartoons  go mudding  go fishing have deep philosophical conversations and help each other out. if I got to be really good friends with someone I would want to learn more about them and their culture  but share from mine. I dont understand this swapping everything that was okay to begin with. they were never racist either. I remember  and have  the episodes were scooby and the gang hang out with don knotts  the harlem globetrotters  and batman! I loved them. I was reading hardy boys and nancy drew when I was really young and then watching these. the world and its shift has changed so much it doesnt make sense anymore.
you are not insane.... perfect take... I do not know why ppl wanna mess these classics up
@labulldog5  I still love levar burton to this day because as a fellow book lover  he was the man back in the day. he knew just how to reach children and inspire a passion for reading and learning. I think we thought less about race and skin color wayyy less in the 90 s. and I used to run around with plastic headbands over my eyes and pretend to be gordy from next gen. I am an aspiring writer that works with disabled people now as an adult. he actually really inspired me and so did mr. rogers and that lady with the puppet lamb chop lol. skin color means nothing  its all about character and learning from each other.
@condor crow  your culture is deeply fascinating and beautiful from all Ive read. just had to say that. I totally agree with everything you said. I think surface level if you turn on a tv show or movie  you instinctively relate to the person that looks like you in some way  the asian person  the blonde  the one tall person whatever else   but if you have a crumb of intelligence  that fades quickly and you wind up relating to the person based on everything you said  traits  skills  personality. we are too surface level as a society nowadays. everything is a mess and we dont relate to each other how we used to.
@uniquorn91  so well said! the most thought I give skin color irl is I throw high spf sunblock at my friends and family who burn easily in the sun. representation is great when its done correctly and not just to prove a point or push an agenda. I come from one of the most mixed countries and cultures on the planet and we all consider ourselves one  aside from a few idiots  so I never look solely at a persons skin color to determine relatability.
@erick white  I love that you said this. my brother in law is irish american from the deep south and coming from a non american family we asked about thatsouthern cooking. he admitted that he found certain dishes were made best by black american women  he will point out that most food coming from an american from the south are enjoyed by everyone and made perfectly. his rant on fried chicken and watermelon was actually so refreshing. he pointed out that a racist stereotype should actually just be a southern stereotype because all southerners eat the same food and to downplay it and make itsound less than because its ascribed to black americans in the the south is ludicrous. he even called out the use of chicory in coffee just this morning. food and culture are so closely linked and such a beautiful thing. as far as scooby goes  I still love those celeb crossover episodes and remember them fondly.
@the boss wolf  thank you! you sounded like a really close friend in this comment. I appreciate you for making me feel kinda normal in this crazy world
@diyahdreams  youre right about surface level. there was and still is a need for representation. and thats absolutely okay  I understand that completely. but I think we all want a normal kind of representation  a good quality one. not hand-me-downs  not leftovers. and thats all hollywood has been giving us - a surface level representation. when you think about it  it might even be worse than no representation at all. at least  it was more honest.
@diyahdreams  I wish we could all feel totally normal my dear. thank you for your kind words. I dunno if you ever watch the witcher  lotr .she hulk... the woke fungus has ruined alot of great tv!!I still have the books but I used to like watching them every now and then
@condor crow  thank you! this is how I have felt for so long! your average person isn t mad at seeing different people and cultures on screen  just give the characters depth and a personality. race swapping is just so cheap and belittling to people of color and  I hate to be the one to say it  but feeds into this idea of erasing white people. we can have everyone represented without the constant guilt being foisted onto white people  men in particular. there is so much to be said about this topic and how it belittles minorities and erases white people  but at the end of the day  it makes me see people of different skin colors  cultures and ethnicities embrace their own  others and actually have some sense.
@diyahdreams  exactly. besides  I haven t seen anyone who was mad at a great character in a great show  even if their race was swapped. in  anne with an e  they had a gay boy and a native girl who weren t in the original and everyone loved them because they were amazing and not one dimensional. in  the series of unfortunate events  they swapped races of three characters and the actors were so great that now I cant imagine those characters played by anyone else but those actors  especially the one that played the banker  God  he s so good  I instantly became his fan .this shows that even race swapping can be done right and done great  but most dont even try. they just swap it and - boom! - done. this is not the right way.people teach kids that their identity and heritage is important. and I agree  it is important. but its not as important as who you are as a person. people are gonna remember what kind of person you were - kind  generous  understanding  supportive or all the opposites - not your skin colour or eye shape. your character and personality comes first  thats what they need to teach kids. and that could be done without belittling any group of people at all.
@diyahdreams  additionally  the fact that he was a black man did not even register at all in my mind until later in life when educators told me I needed to treat him differently than everyone else.  lol  the irony!!
not to mention in one of scooby doo movie its confirmed she taught herself to ride a motorcycle when she was little!!
dont forget martial arts since  cyperchase  and  what s new scooby-doo  in the main verse.
they were a team of friends that kept meeting chanlleges.
in the early 2000 s version she was mc giver. like she made an electric battery to power the car with a bottle of water  a hair pin and 2 aa batteries.
spot on and its a shame they erased it all to push their agenda.
well said about the character
daphne was also the brawler. she kicked ass and looked good doing it. ffs they cant handle hot confident girls
yes they destroyed her power made her powerless thats crazy
these people aren t scooby-doo fans so they dont have knowledge of the lore  and they haven t bothered to do any research. their scooby-doo knowledge is probably based on memes.
@titan blade  exactly right
@younger544yeah its clear they never understood scooby-doo and the gang.this comes off as  oh its just that dumb kids  show we watched one time  so who cares...
agreed!
daphne was the boss.
being rich is useful  you have contacts and resources that most wont  also they need money for fuel  food  and mobile internet. thats without considering intelligence and other factors!
for a while there  the gang was only her  shaggy  and the dogs. she s legitimately the most fleshed-out character in the gang besides arguably shaggy  although as the series went on  he was flanderized into just being dopey  easily scared  and hungry.
how I see it  in rewriting a black guy to be shaggy  who is a former army stoner  who lives in a van  how is this progressive   remember  shaggy was created during the vietnam conflict era.  in addition  the mystery machine team are detectives  and the modern year 2022 view  from the darker side from george floyd  is that calling the police is evil and racist  so how is this connecting to the target audience   velma is doing background checks and calling the sheriff.  the entire thing is flawed and missed the mark.
daphne wasn t some dumb valley girl either. she was extremely resourceful and socially smart  just not book-smart like velma.  daphne used her environments and while she was known to be dangerprone  she always found a means to help out.  she was fred s right hand man in plotting out traps as well.  in later seasons  daphne would adopt the smarts that fred would lose when it came to plots and traps.  fred being the leader but a bit dopey . every member of the scooby doo cast offered something to the group.fred is the leader and driver of the crew  getting everyone organized and plot out where they need to go and do.daphne is the socialite who was able to charismatically ease and pry information from people.  able to keep a strong reputation for the mystery inc.velma is the investigator  being able to spot evidence and make quick connections on what they mean  often the brains of the operation.shaggy is the underdog and inspiration.  while he isn t the strongest  smartest  or brightest tool in the shed. shaggy overcomes impossible odds and protects his friends. often acting as the bait for the various monsters.scooby is the mascot  a reminder of life in all the grim corruption these kids uncover. and shaggy s best friend.
I honestly didn t even know these scooby-doo doo characters had last names and Ive watched them since I was a kid lol.
but daphne is also beautifulthese activist cant stand perfectionthey need someone broken to represent them
I quite recall her also being able to pilot drive several vehicles that nobody else can. vehicles that would require a couple of years just to get the qualifications to pilot drive that one vehicle. she can fly planes  spaceships  drive pilot cruise ships  drive vans  and various other things
shaggy was also rich. his uncle shagsworth is even a skin in multiversus.
I dont understand why hollyweird would berate your experience in order to keep daphne original.guess they them want to fail upwards.
@travis gibbons  you sir put it perfectly. they are a team of friends who complement eachother and if you change things the whole thing falls apart
barz
sorry your not listening your supposed to forget all of that to let them brainwash you. thank you for standing up for the character and generally not letting negativity embrace this and enlightening others the value of the og character.
hmmmm   in retrospect   youre absolutely correct.
the  problem  she had that twitter doesnt like is thatshe s a. rich and b. white
preach the truth.
she s used her wealth in many movies to either save the group  start the journey and even fund it all the way through.and both in the movies and the show she had these very unique abilities stemming from knowledge regarding clothes  brands  the entire beauty space that includes nail  eye etc products and many times she came up with very creative ways to solve issues  whether that was mirrors  powders and the like.she straight up had the most unique input. shaggy and scooby were the goofball characters that always  almost supernaturally  made it through by just running like hell or perfectly dodging stuff  freddie had a real affinity for traps  velma was the smart  dot connecting link of the group and daphne had this going for her  which is something she shares with very few fictional characters as far as I remember.its so bizarre seeing this go down. how have we ended up here
gotta love when the writers know less about the characters then the fans
@speedy  no  that is shaggy.
@lopro  give more respect to shaggy.
@anecro  give more respect to shaggy.
same with fred
engage woke activist mode   how dare you  it was blatantly obvious that daphne was just for the male fans to gaze upon. the fact thatshe also did clever things and was a valuable member of the team is totally irrelevant.    woke activist mode rest of the world   are you even listening to what comes out of your mouth  you ve managed to contradict your own  point  within the same sentence.
she also had a wide array of martial arts skill
she was pretty much the socialite of the group. she was always my favorite character next to scooby-doo and shaggy. how dare they just insult her and say she was worthless. I remember in one of the irl scooby-doo movies she knew martial arts and was kicking everyones azz. lol
@rich rd duska  is that actually possible  o.o
@power700  and in the live action movie
she also has contacts all over the world  can fly a plane and has combat skills.
@bree  absolutly not. which is why its mc giver.
shes literally a locksmith. she can make a key and pick a lock from anything in her purse   shes so fucking skilled the bad guys have to kidnap her to give themselves a chance to win   like daphne was the powerhouse man and she looked great doing it
they all had their own sets of skills even shaggy and scoobz. and together they loved their friendship and solving mysterious problems.
very succinct. that was a perfect dissection of her character
this right here is the reason why daphne is my favorite character!
in scooby-doo! and the samuraI sword she s a black belt
is this the new groomy doo
didn t she also buy the iconic mystery machine also
yep all true.
well freddie was a good character too .
wasn t daphne also litterally the muscle of the team through the entire 2000s
daphne also seems to be in sports like surfing for example
@lopro  with how shaggy is always eating and looking like skeletor jr  I think he might have a tapeworm. a big one.
yes  almost like every member of the group had skills and a role in the team.I think even some of the plots are helped by the fact that daphne does have fashion knowledge  so she recognizes materials and whatnot.
2003 daphne was hands down the best version. she had laser lipstick. she could make certain potion with mixes of make up and perfume. they really flushed her out
100
@matt mcdougle  or stereotypes.
@g vnhtsm  and Im pretty sure because she was rich they were able to travel to alot of high class places that had  ghost . you think they would have let a stoner like shaggy into those places if not for daphne
and most importantly  she was an original character. not a knock-off of something else.
@rich rd duska  oh damn lol that would ve been cool if it was though. cant people make a baked potato into a clock or something
@khI clark  either her or shaggy. I could have sworn it was shaggy who got the van but I could be mistaken.
@mistress9 you nailed it! daphne had a backstory built up over the past 40 or so years  there was nothing broken with her.
@matt mcdougle  sad but true....
exactly Im so glad Im not the only one who remembers!!!!!
thank you for this! finally  someone was able to look through daphne  her worth and significance to the team. not a lot of people can do that because they only look at the surface of things. I really hate it when fans pegged her as just the  pretty girl . yes  she was the  damsel in distress   but she was more than that in the original source material  and the live-action films made her more by saving the day with her resourcefulness and fighting abilities.
she wasn t the smart one. her name is daphne for a reason. she just had intuition nobody else had.
she was also a great athlete. like when she competed in surfing  skiing  martial arts  etc. daphnis is such a bada
thats going to take more than 0 seconds to forget
wouldn t say she s a hippie at all but the rest of what you said makes sense
only true fans now this. people looking in who are knee-jerking to shit they dont know about think otherwise
she was an accomplished journalist and made her friends her crew. literally draked them and brought them all with her to the top. she was the best

she s the best!!!
plus her martial arts skills in some adaptation. she s really perceptive too  there were times when she picked up on stuff before velma did because velma was too trapped in her tunnel vision.
like honestly Im just mad that they made her the adopted daughter of police officers. I haven t seen that many episodes of the old scooby-doo but I have watched all of the mystery inc. they really want to give her character conflict  what about using what mystery inc. did  from what I remember  and making her parents not really there for her. I thought that gave her conflict enough.
okay wait I just remembered something. in mystery inc.  once again the only show I watched all the way through  wasn t fred the adopted one that was curious about his parents  like I vividly remember that being a huge plot point.
and she was good at cricket!
not to mention she was funny like in the original scooby doo she d be danger prone daphne and do something a little bit dumb that people could make fun of and keep entertained Imean it was pretty funny
yeah man  she was smart as hell.
nah bro  I agree with you and all  but one time daphne literally turned a closet into a hotel room in mere seconds.
basically the two girls of the group has opposing intellect types  one practical and one technical so she s definitely integral to the group  fred just has traps  shaggy just has that za so  everyone has their uses
this right here! right on the money my good fellow! I honestly love daphne s character so much  because of this reason! she s knowledgable  kind  and is great at figuring out peoples intentions. Im like also 90  sure she knows some sort of martial art  if not she s great at fighting never the less. she has taking on demons and ghosts! she also drives motorcycles extremely well! she is so underrated in the stuff she does  I love thatshe could totally be like a vigilante and no one would bat an eye. she s so fun! it really sucks that they erased all the parts of her that were of substance  she really is great.
only reason they didn t notice this is because they were probably kids when they watched.
sad cause she also knew a lot about makeup and she could have been retcon as a forensic specialist since she also knew were many ingredients for makeup comes from and yeah she love to take care of her hair so she would have bobby pins that are good with all kind of locks except tumblers lol
this! she was also clever and very much able to social engineer several situations to her advantage without using her looks to get by. the chars were all stereotypes  to be sure  but they also all had personality beyond that.
yeh not to mention she had skills  she could fly planes as just one example.  I get the feeling these guys were just watching the original series and not the newer stuff.  my son loved scooby doo so he watch alllllllll of it.
@jomsnoms  exactly! my daughter and I have watched each incarnation of scooby doo several times. daphne was really talented. she could pick locks  she got really good at trap making with fred. there s such a good dynamic between her and her dad and how he disapproved of fred because he was  low class  but fred worked to prove to her dad he was a good guy and that daphne was talented and didn t need to be high class to be awesome. daphne had no confidence behind her facade. there were many layers to her. this is such a horrible take on her character.
easier to overwrite her if you pretend there was nothing there. would that be the screenwriting equivalent of a strawman argument
@  kyu  literally what they did here. zero research  saw a character they could use to bait viewers in and push their woke agenda. completely disrespecting the existing lore and writing and its dishonest.
didn t she help fred get the car
let me point out all the sins right away  rich white -  privileged white kid  inequality  model -  sexist  male centric  dad helped the company -  nepotism  why couldn t they do what huntie does - the big one knows nothing about huntie s business. and huntie can sell expensive arts  too. pay the reparation fee  white daphne!
@thedeepfriar  yes her dad lent them the money when he realized that it was something daphne was good at and wanted to pursue.
wasn t she also a reporter and had martial arts skills
agreed.
daphne got an upgrade in the 2000 films by giving her martial arts and macguvyer skills
I agree. she is truly more than just a pretty face. thats why I loved her designs so much. so seeing the new one hurts   cause the whole point of her was while she was goregous   she had more to her character.
like most of these  reboots   revisions  today  the creators know next to nothing about the source material  despite claiming they do. its most obvious in the rings of power  today  but its apparent in everything from scooby to heman to ghostbusters  to major franchises like lotr  marvel  star trek  and star wars. its completely politically motivated and mirrors revisionist history in pop-culture a la 1984.
@ransom baggins  spot on assessment.
@bill myers  right  the creators never meant for velma to be a lesbian  it was just a dumb fan theory that they finally caved into  just like when they made harley quinn and poison ivy an actual couple
exactly! they just vaguely remember something about the fandom they want to destroy!
I agree with everything u said but Im so tired of people saying  woke . its so over used now..
yeah but her backstory sounds  too white  probably  cant have that.
and first ep stated she and shaggy were friends first as she notes how hes the grooviest acrobatic she knows but  they treat it like all she is is beauty. watch they sexualize this daphne yet diss the true daph
it was blatant in the dialogue  Im much more three dimensional than that! the arrogance in thatstatement.
@hendrixxx  yeah along with the terms  selfie    binge-watch    reboot    twerking   etc.  etc.  etc.
@jomsnoms  most likely these people just took the typical superficial jokes about scooby doo seriously and never really thought much of it.
I never really watched sd but my younger brother was obsessed and it was always on. just from background noise I thought that paragraph was off. I remember her kinda being the only badass in the group in a way  and the one who tried to hold everyone together.
dont let it get to you. everything you like is going to be updated and modified and destroyed. we have the financiers  the tech  but the creatives in this generation suck. until you stop giving them money  it wont end.
her mom was in the pyramid club
@doug d  agreed
ok so they probably may be only watch the old scooby doo s but in the newer iterations she literally picks locks and stuff and like her parents were rich but she didn t want to just do thatshe wanted a model and I believe just be in the solve mysteries because she loves doing that now apparently she s going to be raised by two lesbians cops to make her sound cool like that is the most clich  shit Ive ever seen
she also successfully runs a talk show in the zombie movie
they dont like anything  even themselves
@austin parsley  actually harley and ivy been a couple before in the comics with good development leading up to it
you do bring up a point with that last sentence. its like the people who remake this stuff just randomly grab a show  any show regardless if they know anything about it or not then just create a bastrddied version of said show. we got to stop praising people based on skin color and their sex and start looking at the bigger picture because in the end  this content will leave a legacy for future generations to ignore.
you expect them to do research into the ip they were handed... hahahahahahahahhahahathat is a good joke!
facts
yeah its been a long time but I remember the old ones from when I was a little kid.   and yeah they made velma look like meg from family guy.
only reading the first message I agree that most likely out of the five live action movies the scooby-doo franchise has under its belt the hbo scooby-doo production gang probably unanimously voted a velma and daphne as their favorite because of hollywood casting sarah jeffery of descendants fame a latina as the sassy redheaded model daphne blake and needlessly made her mom a black woman to explain away how a white man has a latina daughter especially after they casted the actor who played erwin in the suite life as mr blake
@d s beats  yeah these people probably didn t do any research at all  there is more than four cartoon shows more than 30 cartoon movies  more than two live action movies and some comic books.
I dont think these woke people even had a tv  especially a life.
I am dutch and I grew up with cartoon network. everything on cartoon network in my time was in english with dutch subs. thats how I learned english. and from games ofc.
@metal videos  lucky you. I had no subs  had to guess the meaning for a while till I finally got the russian dub xd
its called fan fiction I wouldn t be surprised if shaggy and fred have a  love  scene in the shower and they make scooby in to shaggy s furry persona.
these guys are willing to anger 90  people for 10   others
@r jinxx    honestly dont know who youre referring to for others but as an asian I really dont care daphne is asian. like the whole thing is kind of wack. we could get new representation and new characters but they do this instead. hopefully the writing is good but if not  like  great we got another shit written show with bastardized characters  and Imean that their characterization is bastardized  not that the race part does it  that are race swapped which just furthers backlash when we actually do get good  well written and fresh representation on screen. or contributes to another barrier for people who do want to give us that fresh content. Im willing to wait instead of making shit always about race and using it to cover up bad writing or some agenda
yeah  man shaggy without scoob is like the sea without the salt.........
@flying monkey death squadron commander  underrated comment
its like they only watched where are you and nothing else
daphne s character is specifically to show that pretty girls also have talents and virtues in addition to being a pretty face... the sole purpose of daphne s existence is so as not to underestimate girls for their appearance which is in itself a feminist message in fact so in conclusion  they just hate pretty girls
I think the best adaptations of scooby doo for all characters were what s new  scooby doo and the movies that really flushed out their personalities while keeping true to who they are and why they might be in a group. this just rewrites them to be how the creators want them to be  like them and not who they are
the fact that the mystery inc gang lasted about 50 years without being butchered by twitter is impressive
velma  she s the brains of the group who can be a bit emotional. thanks to her problem solving skill she always figure out who the monster is.daphne  she s the pretty girl and often becomes the damsel in distress. her well of knowledge about beutI products and latest trends often help make sense of clues. daphne is a bit of a dare devil but have a problem keeping an eye out for trouble. thanks to itshe often gets kidnapped.fred  a jock who often is a bit naive. he s the man whit the plan that doesnt work. he likes to make complicated traps that usually traps shaggy  scooby and somehow the monster two by accident.shaggy and scooby  they are the comidic duo who often defies logic.probable the most easily scared guys you can find but will always do anything to save their food or friends.
a body falls out of a locker  missing a brain. for once I like the writers self inserting on this one.
daphne was my favorite character because she showed you can be girly and be knowledgeable about things.
I never really watched scooby-doo doo  but I always loved daphne for being sweet  smart  kind  competent... and feminine.
the sad thing is  the art style is so freaking cool. I actually would have watched this if not for the wokeness
when did having a good story have to be replaced by woke trash .I grew up with the original series.  even had imaginary friends of the group.  I remember  imagining the group in the back seat of my parents car when we went on trips.  making an adventure with the team.daphne  was great in many ways.  I believe her father footed the bill for the team so they could travel and solve mysteries.
did they forget that daphne knew karate  literally went on a arc to find herself
as I recall  daphne was the one who typically found the secret doors and passageways  usually by accident and in a comedic way  the same sort of running gag as velma losing her glasses .  she was also the one that had the most useful items on her.  normally female centric items like a bobby pin  a compact  make-up  etc.  the bobby pin could unlock doors  the compact s mirror could be used to reflect light into the villain s eyes or trigger a light-sensitive trap  blush could be used to dust for fingerprints  and so on.  she almost always discovered at least one key clue to solving the mystery and usually took part in the end of episode explanation of the clues  meaning she was on par with the rest of them in terms of deductive reasoning.  the idea thatshe was the damsel and mostly just there to get rescued doesnt hold up in the og series  thatstarted to slide in later.  either because writer s weren t sure how to write her  or as a criticism of her character.
besides daphne was their moral compass she always question things in a moral light  are you sure   does this make sense  sorta dialogue
I remember daphne as one of the reasons that the gang was stable  seeing as she was more level headed than most. I remember her as fred s control  in the sense thatshe stops him from doing absolute bonker shit  I remember her mostly from mystery inc.   seeing as he was someone who was kinda careless at times
I love the part where velma says  I demand trial by combat!  and then made out with cersie. brave and bold!
archetypes  stereotypes  are why people can connect with most any media  really. if you cant grok what a character is  its not always fascinating. thats what made  pacific rim  work  for me  even though you were thrown into the middle of a situation  the characters had recognizable archetypes they adhered to that helped yourelate to them and get to like them. raleigh beckett was the grizzled veteran who d been through a lot and endured personal loss and trauma  and thats what made yourelate to him  for example. this  however  is another story  this is the ugly kind of stereotyping that makes the characters unlikable and non-relatable. couple that with the customary bad writing and mediocre acting  and this is why these modernized adaptations will always fail. in their efforts at making characters  relatable  the woke crew are rendering them the exact opposite with heavy handed execution and a total lack of knowledge of respect for the characters.
my knowledge of og daphnie. smart  confident  pretty  excellent leader  master of influence  she bribed shaggy and scobby so many times   rich  multitalented. she knows how to ride a motorcycle  she is an entrepreneur  she has a black belt and can pick locks. I think that at some point she might have just decided to let herself get kidnapped just to find more information because there is no way anyone gets abducted that many times without learning how to look out for potential dangerzones.
I always liked daphne because she was pretty but not sexual. she was a refined respectable woman. balanced out  the gang  well  she was the heart of the group. that is a crucial archetype for a group dynamic in stories. their is the heart  the leader  the smarts  and the every man. their are many archetypes  but those 4 are the ones thatscooby doo ran with and it worked well.daphne had social awareness  fred was the leader  shaggy was the everyman  and velma was the smart one. that made for a good group dynamic. than scooby was freaking scooby doo! why on earth did they remove him. he was the random chaos in the show that made it work. shaggy was kind of our conduit  and scooby was our best friend. its their random actions that led to solving the mystery and catching the bad guys.
the original daphne always been number one in my heart.
here is what I remember about og daphne  she was responsible for the disguises the team sometimes wore and seemed to be good at that and also always had all the tools and costumes needed for that around. and for some reason I remember her checking out how dusty a place is  just for determining if a place was used frequently. freddy was obviously into her  but itseemed that for some reason she never gave him a go - that didn t mean she was a lesbian.so  thatstatement that there was nothing to know about her is just ignorant and disrespectful to the original work in my opinion. even if it is not much itshould not just be erased but instead used and expanded upon. maybe  if it really doesnt make sense  change it a little bit. also having a lesbian couple as parents and then  not understanding  her own sexuality is a weird take anyway.scooby doo is a kids show anyways and new iterations are not created for those adults who grew up with the old scooby doo characters after all. but I dont feel like you need to force all ideas of diversity into every single modern remake.
daphne was a great character. she was optimistic  beautiful and a clutz. she had that flaw. she was slightly awkward in spite of her beauty. she tended to be clumsy and she tended not to even notice when guys were interested in her because like fred she was more interested in solving mysteries. she doesnt need fixing.
to be fair   twitter didn t exist until around 16 years ago.
baaah
oh snap!!!!!
......
buuuuurrrrrrrn!!!!
brad carver  thats a good one!
ok that deserves a thumbs up.
hollywood in general right now
savage lmfaoooo
hi-yooooooohhhhhhhh!
krillin   senzu bean!

@rex lumontad  cell  ha! perfect!
I just made a Godawful squawking sound that made my husband look over at me in concern. thank you
this is why I still stick to this day a pup named scooby-doo 13 ghosts of scooby-doo so they can f    with those cuz they know better so stick with the original and dont bother with woke trash

I found daphne to be very underestimated. she was almost like the characters who had all the gadgets to get them out of sticky situations. she s always prepared for shit to hit the fan. that purse she carries has gotten the gang out of more trouble than fred s traps actually working. not only that  but she took up martial arts even when she was portrayed as the damsel in destress. she s charming but also doesnt allow herself to be pushed around. she sticks up for her friends and I have rarely seen her super worried about her appearance because  as I stated before  she is always prepared to take care of it. she s probably the only person who thinks 5 steps ahead in the gang she is poorly underestimated.
daphne was the most competent one of the group. everyone else was knuckleheads including velma although she was smart she was also clumsy. but daphne was written to be smart  and adept  and pretty. she was literally the full package.
its characters like daphne that idiots always criticize because they never understand what a  jack of all trades  is. I will admit at times it feels like there is no good reason why she would know have the random item knowledge  but I rather have it and not need to than to find myself needing it and not having it.
@envix  dont say stupid things.
@envix  thats not true. daphne was actually the clumsy one. someone  usually velma or fred would say   daphne did it again!  or something to that effect. but it didn t matter because she always managed to find some clue with her clumsiness. she definitely wasn t stupid.
@8rr725  yea I guess they were all clumsy in their own way now that I think about it. I think brittany from the show daria might ve been based off daphne somewhat  being the stereotypical ditzy cheerleader type but she s actually really smart when it comes to certain things you wouldn t expect.
@8rr725  I think it depends on which scooby-doo you grew up on. almost every statement on daphne is true in the comment section . the characters and their personalities changed as the years went on.
@just a crab  a jack of all trades is a master of none  but oftentimes better than a master of one.
they axed scooby but cause they couldn t change him to fix there messed up show that they know is going to flop and then they will blames for not watching sporting it
wait they removed the title character  wow the show sucks just on that point alone
none of the characters are supposed to be sexual because its a kids show.  not sexualizing young ppls shows used to be a thing  remember  maybe one of them was gay  maybe they weren t .we would never know.
daphne was sexualized the entire time in the scooby doo movie lol. all the women were honestly.
@josh cramer  firstly  Im talking about the cartoon. as far as the movie is concerned  they did decently well at portraying the characters. I also wouldn t say she was overly sexualized especially considering it was a hollywood production.disney channel actresses on kids shows were more sexualized than she was in the movie.the movie wasn t perfect with the characterizations however it was clear they respected the characters and didn t go crazy with their play room.I think a generally people have a 10-20  play room when recreating canonical characters. than they have a 30-40  play room for parodies  than a 50-65  play room for inspired characterization.scooby-doo movie gets a pass for having clear respect for the characters and franchise.
@mrsirfluffy  I liked the movies because they embraced the campiness and the tropes of the characters. they were self aware like with the  dorky chicks like you turn me on too  line said by fred
Im pretty sure they started the archetypes that got into every other show. they were the originals.
@josh cramer  what  even velma
@josh cramer  yup  the movie had plenty of wiggle room to have fun with the characters. they also were focused on making a good movie and there wasn t a blatant agenda behind it.thatsaid  daphne from the cartoons is iconic and daphne from the movie is just beloved. I like the movie version  but I have another level of respect for the original.also  I love the campiness as well. you cantell when trope poking was done by people who loved the show. their characterization was also still kept mostly intact. which is likely why they went more of the campy route  which was a great choice by the directors.
well her skirt was a little high above her knees lol smh
yeh its a show scooby doo without scooby. and Imean shag does like to hang out with scooby more doesnt mean he doesnt like velma . sorry I hadn t watch the whole series of old scooby doo . only some episodes and I do like them.
I thought scooby was the heart of the show
are you saying shaggy is the everyman   um...I cant agree lol
shaggy is great.
@josh cramer  I do believe that movie was meant to be a  corn  flick. there are so many innuendos its unbelievable.
@doug d  in the live actions move sorta. in the cartoons  she had this dorky smart girl vibe
@adam  yeah like I said  james gunn was poking fun at all the tropes and stereotypes that those characters represented since the 1960s.. he wanted to make changes but the studio wouldn t let him. things were not as progressive back 20 years ago as they are now.
because it was a live action movie. live action movies sucks and dont count.
daphne blake had overbearing rich parents that did not approve of the way she spent her life. often times while fred might have come up with the traps and velma might have been the detective daphne was more outgoing and willing to speak with people. she asked the hard questions when they went after people thats why she got targeted so much by the bad guys.
not only were characters beyond their stereotypes  in original scooby doo  but mystery inc. actually expanded them.not only was velma the smart guy of the group  she had a dry and sassy personality and handled heartbreak with layers of snark along with still trying her best to fit in despite often coming off rudedaphne was not just a bimbo. she was also social and was very good with stuff like getting information from people by talking to them and even had swish army knife of skills like lock picking and even karate.fred while being a great leader also had fascination of creating traps and plans and actually had a brain behind brawn  but was very oblivious to emotional things and was not always the best with words which daphne contrast him with.shaggy wad the comic relief  but he and scooby also were a good distraction and often even got the group together by their antics and brought levity in darker situations. I would say stereotyping the stoner stereotype as black and the one who knows karate as asian is not a good look.even that aside itseems they are gonna character assasinate like hell after  the development  they were given in mystery.inc show.
translation  she was too hot and confident  which is unfair to women who are not hot and confident
I love how they have to describe the character to you instead of seeing the character develop naturally with good writing. you know  like a writer should lmfao
I would even argue the two live action movies  not counting the 2 straight to dvd  made her the muscle of the team. in the first one she beats the wrestler and in the second one she goes toe-to-toe with the black knight  and then she s the one who comes up with the idea to beat both the knight and the electric ghost. and she also beat thatsamuraI  warrior freddy could not in  the cyber chase  during the  hello cyberdream  montage.
I recently watched 1969 s what s new scooby doo  and she really is utilized much. however Ive moved to 1976 s the scooby doo show  and she contributes more to the group which is only expounded upon in later series. this velma series seems to be a genuine bastardization wearing the skin of my favorite childhood show.
yet despite her loving home  daphne still struggles with abandonment issues why
the worst part about this to me is that they chose to piss everyone off.  cause like  since they clearly didn t want to use the actual mystery inc. gang but wanted to cash in on the ip they could ve just done their own thing. mystery inc. is a legitimate gig thanks to daphne s support  remember thatshe s a blank slate though  so they could ve just done a different squad. hey we re here to solve the mystery!  huh ! youre not mystery inc.!  yeah we are  we re-  mystery inc. homicide squad . or something  I dunno. point being they had this very obvious way to both use the ip and not piss everyone off when they made new characters. and instead they choose to replace the old characters and piss everyone off while saying they suck for getting mad. super disappointing in almost every respect both on the screen and behind the scenes.
remember when scooby doo was about solving mysteries  good times.....
daphne was her own character throughout the many different shows and movies of this franchise. they are making a mountain out of a molehill
I think this might be another scrappy doo phase. you use the same character designs in something  more  like  zombie island  I think fans would be on board with it and support it. some fans will miss her catchphrases and unique velma way of talking. as long as the character has passion for mystery solving  people will embrace the new version of the character.
the age question of the group is a little mixed. some of the modern iterations like mystery inc did the high school thing  but more of the interpretations  including where are you   13 ghosts  and most of the movies  have the characters as college-aged or older because of the autonomy it gave the characters.
dont make me cry. as a small child daphne was my favorite. she was awesome in scooby! Im 54 and youre going to make me cry.
I remember daphne learned karate also had her own talk show was very clever in her own way
classic daphne was a kind  cool  confident  outgoing  charismatic  fashionista  whose unorthodox and hidden skills manage to help solve many mysteries and even saved the gang multiple times... and oh yeah  she s also a freaking martial artist! she s also an adept detective on her own. and even displayed an efficient amount of intelligence when she took on both roles as the leader and brains during her run on  the 13 ghosts of scooby-doo .  she was a rich girl who could ve stayed at home and lived in luxury and comfort but instead she chose a life full of danger and adventure  solving mysteries  helping people and carving her own legacy along the way. any fan of scooby-doo or at the very least  someone who watched a fair amount of episodes  would know this about daphne. yeah  its clear the folks running this s-show aren t fans. and Im convince the only scooby-doo content they had ever interacted with  is that creepy  perverted  james gunn script  wb scrapped.
velma was a simple character  perfect the way she was. they dont have to add any details to her.
they didn t just do  something  right with the original scooby-doo  they did everything right
bro bro bro daphne s whole point was thatshe s someone with rich parents  but instead of leading a life of luxury she goes around with her friends on adventures to solve these mysteries   plus she  at multiple points  has saved the team using her wits she already is a loved and balanced character
and Im guessing these new writers didn t look at the scooby and the 13 ghost series where she was the defacto leader because fred and velma left and she still managed to solve things with a hippy  a thief  and a dog.
whoever thought it was a good idea to change such a beloved franchise in such a drastic way  effectively lost their mind. hbo should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to happen.
can only be hot and insecure  pretending to be confident  or ugly and confident.
its daphne s fault that they aren t daphne!
lol!
feminism  all men comments are just about sexism.
I need to be validated reeeeeee  - feminists probably
I only watched the adult version of scooby doo  and I agree velma was so hot in it.
@andy st  that version probably still has a daphne in it with a deeper character and more thought put into it that this abomination will be.it also had other things put into daphne  which is probably a plus for that particular movie  p

advertising in 2032 by ryan long.
they could just say we re changing characters and their traits to be more aligned with the stories we want to tell  this is a reimaginition in a totally different tone and theme. they dont have to shit on the ogs and create problems that are non existent with ogs. I dont have problems with changing and reimagining characters but why attack the ogs. why cant they just exist and be successful and get recognitions without stepping all over the originals  especially when the originals aren t problematic in the first place. its just like the whole twitter s  I fix the art  which is just so condescending and disrespectful.
@lo straniero  kill two birds with one stone.
@lo straniero  their reasons are not thatsophisticated. they simply want to take what people like and change it if not destroy it. they do so because they cannot come up with original characters anyone would want to see  e.g.  the movie  bros  .  they ve changed 3 of the 4 characters in a cartoon  and the 4th still looks nothing like the original character  and the main character  the dog  also shaggy s companion  is gone. the mysteries they are investigating seem to be gruesome.  if your classmate is stuffed in a locker room after having her brain sucked out  imagine the horror a normal girl would have for the rest of her life. every parent would withdraw his daughter from the school.  it wouldn t be a fun mystery for teens to look into  interfering with police and destroying evidence. not to mention itshows no empathy for the murdered girl.       its not  velma.  its not  scooby doo.  its a new cartoon that they know no one will want to watch  except to keep the ratings up and see if they bash men each week .
you cantell sarah michelle gellar knock it out the park as daphne this is not her she had nothing to do with this this my fail one season only not jinxing it hopefully it is a good outcome but they may velma embarrassment to the original and oh yeah and no original movies the two of them right she liked it him she actually bought clothes from this girl to impress seth green character leather tight suit
a loooooong time ago now..ancient even. this shit ain t scooby no mo
Im grateful I grew up in a time where scooby doo was fun and about mysteries and the supernatural
now its about solving who you are
mystery inc is still my favorite show
remember when scooby doo was in scooby doo  also good times
remember when it was about scooby doo and his pet human shaggy
@areion316  it went hard for no reason
@gon d
4 years is ancient .... oh God... its been 4 years already
and nowthey re solving genders
quite.
scooby doo and thirteen ghost was my favourite
well  sorta
look at the 8 other renditions of the show if you want that.
@keyki  wtf is scooby the doggy really not in his own show  what the hell is even the point
@max master j  apparently the writers think scooby is for kids and couldn t find a way to include him in their story .allegedly xd
now the mystery is the woke show lol
@gator nuggets  the hell are you talking about  did you skip every tv show release after 2003 mystery incorporated  was on tv and was pretty well recieved by critics and the fans. and that came out on 2010 and lasted for 52 episodes.and honestly. keep it cool scooby doo was funny. everyone just skiped over it because of the  arguably questionable  artstyle. 2015.scooby-doo and guess who  was another tv show that cameout in 2019. and that wasn t badly recieved either.heck. what s new scooby doo lasted from 2002 until 2006. and shaggy   scooby-doo get a clue! came out in 2008. it wasn t good. like at all. but it aired on tv.
@gator nuggets  like hoenstly it just sounds like you somehow ignored the sooby doo franchise for 19 years. and just came back after you heard about this new train wreck of a show.
@gator nuggets  yes  its sad when you dont know you are living in the good times until they are over. I specifically watch movies and shows from the 90s and back. nothing new makes me as happy as that era.
@james gabriel  it was an underrated classic not enough people knew about it
@andrenitro x1000    he was brendan fraser living in a bunker under a city unaware of the events on the surface yes this is a movie reference.
@keyki  the writing team were not smart enough to make scooby a virtual aI on their smartphones or something instead of a real life talking dog and they get paid big bucks to create the story for the show for all those episodes that its going to get green lit for. itshouldn t have been approved to be aired.
@ed v8 zr1  agreed
@keyki  thank you
@ed v8 zr1  blast from the past
this is why I dont like changing a character that already exists. changing a character s gender  ethnicity  and or sexual preference doesnt improve the character  it just makes people dislike the character and the people who made the decision. its incredibly difficult to change a character when they already have years or decades worth of content with them. most of these projects fail  and this one just adds to the pile.this is not my velma or daphne  and I hope others agree this is a separate entity from the characters we already know.
the problem with daphne is in the early cartoons  she just wasn t consistent.  she varied between being the one to find all the hidden doors and pick locks and make quips and the one who just got kidnapped mid-episode.  there was characterization there but it wasn t consistent.
doesnt anyone remember that daphne was the klutz of the group  she d somehow screw something up but it would somehow help them in the long run. they always called her  danger-prone daphne
just came across this channel. love your laid back but insightful delivery.
scooby doo already had a perfect reboot. its called mystery incorporated. it was borderline perfect. the characters were great.
I dont remember having all this backstory on the characters in the original.  all I remember is it being a group of kids solving mysteries. its so different they might as well have just made a different show all together.  seems like all they would have had to do was change the names of the characters and the name of the show
daphne was an actual kidnapped victim most episode she was cute but she would contribute in every episode because it was a team always helped solve mysteries and I believe shes from a rich family
why deconstruct daphne  she was already awesome in the original series. she started off as an absolute clutz only to then become a strong leader of mystery inc.  or scooby-doo detective agency  when fred and velma left. then became a tv reporter show and learned how to do karate.
I watched scooby as a little girl in the early 70 s. why mess with a successful show. I loved all they characters and there differences and  how they created a cohesive unit. what a shame  another memory ruined.
all of this with daphne is absolutely necessary!Imean its a remake of a hanna-barbera show  and we know how much they all used focus on social issues and identity politics.you all remember how the herculoids protested the vietnam war  and how the smurfs were always trying to save the whales  back in the day.ohhh yes  this is absolutely needed for a show about a group of teens and their talking dog who solve mysteries and unmask fake ghosts!!
not everyone needs an expansive  emotionally-scarring backstory. relatively simple  one-note characters can be fun  too.
you ever notice how they tend to do this with female cartoon characters  they did this with harley quinn  they claimed she was  too sexualized  when she wore completely modest clothing in btas  then they make her wear next to nothing and have sex with poison ivy and kiss batgirl claiming she s freely expressing her feminine side. they did it with the powerpuff girls  taking them from little girls into angsty women who have sex with anything with a pulse. now they re doing it with daphne blake  claiming she s  too sexualized  and are changing her to be brought up by lesbians  wants to have sex with velma  and her big promotional debut is her wearing nothing but soap suds in certain areas.  she ll discover why she has red hair.  maybe because she has scottish heritage  which we learned in the loch ness monster movie  the daphne I remember from the classic series was smart and inquisitive  asking questions that helped solve the mystery. she was the caring and nurturing member of the team  always concerned with the others  safety. and whenever she got in trouble  she d figure a way out. these writers are basically inserting their own fap material with the usual  woke  blend crap poured in.
good breakdown and really well spoke. subbed!
daphne was always resourceful. she constantly used her connects and knowledge that comes with being wealthy to aid the gang.
daphne had her own mystery solving show in zombie island. she was even famous  wealthy and adventurous because of her success. why cant they just go back to this
wow  daphne being a vain socialite in the popular clique. what an original take on her character. how can you say thatshe s nothing like every other interpretation of the character when she s .every other interpretation of the character
she had no personality  um yeah she did. she was the popular girl archetype. the pretty girl with good fashion sense. she was also  danger prone daphne  as the others often called her because she had a propencentiy to get herself in danger. either by being kidnapped or being somewhat clumsy. also the original was a bit before my time but Im also pretty sure she was the rich princess too with wealthy parents. she was also shown to be incredibly resourceful often being able to take mundane objects and combine them into something useful .was she the most original character ever  no. but they act like the rest of the scooby gang wasn t a high-school stereotype. fred is clearly the  all american-boy   velma is the nerd  shaggy is the burnout stoner. each of them was a stereotype with one or 2 extra features added on. frend had his trap making  shaggy was a coward and glutton  velma was an unflinching skeptic. the only character from the gang that was truly original was scooby himself as a lisping dog with cowardice and gluttony added on but also random bursts of immense courage.these people dont know shit about the thing they are claiming to fix.plus new versions of the show have gone to great lengths to already expand on the characters daphne included. zombie island had her persuing a career as a reporter  the mystery inc remake fleshed out all of her original qualities and add in a talent for singing and a hawty streak  etc.these clowns need to piss off. they aren t fixing anything.
all the characters had their roles. shaggy and scooby were like the scouts. they d always find the killer or whatever first and then report back. velma and dphne were like the generals and planned the shit out bringing the brains. then freddy boy come over and beat they ass with a random ass trap he built real quick.
this is maybe the most  screw the fans  series yet honestly. velma has had belligerent crushes on multiple male characters  johnny bravo and sam winchester come to mind first   daphne had a series where it was just her  shaggy  and scooby and she had a ton of character  and shaggy is straight up just actually stereotyping. how are we even at this point
well said
what annoys me the most is they fail to see the flaws in their logic. if changing the detail about the character shouldn t matter to original fans  then why is it important to make the change in the first place the only answer that makes sense is they didn t care to begin with and only wanted to do what our society has been doing for over a decade now. using a familiar ip because it ll sell rather then risking a new ip  ubisoft and how all their games are the same at this point .
honestly the sexuality one can work take harley quinn  but that works because it was a progression in her story and one that made sense however just flipping a switch and making changes like that rarely are well received
@will challoner  harley and ivy where already a thing in the comics but I agree with you it also doesnt feel shoehorned and doesnt directly insult the audience
@luluachoo  sorry I should have prefaced I was talking about the comics not the show
@will challoner  oh lol my bad
@will challoner  though to be fair. even in her comic debut  the animated series ones  harley and ivy were already implied to at least be fooling around.so technically they were aleays sorta of a thing from the get go. the main line comics just took longer to get to that point
@alexia hoardwing  exaaactly!!!
I agree
the only series I remember actually doing it well are the boys and rise of the tmnt
100  if you want to make a show about an asian girl solving mysteries then make it an original show  and you can do whatever you want...if its good people would watch...but dont try to sale me scooby-doo with no scooby-doo.
thatshow gave the characters so much depth it was insane.and the movies have been continuing the canon.but 20 years of building this universe is now problematic
@leohan rush  its 2022 everything is problematic because everyone is obsessed with representation and being woke and what not.
I actually really enjoyed thatseries.
nope  they ruined velma. that was the beginning of the downfall. velma and shaggy date. she spends the whole time trying to change shaggy and make him someone else. and she was jealous of scooby. jealous of the dog dude. then they break up and she wont let it go. it was a decent show but I hated that version of velma.
@not sure   that was the storyline you described adding on to velma and marcI having crushes on each other  which would of turned into a romantic relationship if the show did not get cancelled.the showrunner stated this was going to happen.
@derrick daniels   its 2022 everything is problematic because everyone is obsessed with representation  -  hollywood isn t everyone.  most of us were just fine with how scooby and the gang were portrayed.  why do they keep trying to fix what wasn t broken and then wonder why everyone get s upset
its like the overly sympathetic villain used in media.after being exposed to it for so long  having a villain do evil just for evils sake is surprisingly refreshing compared to all the mediocre to bad sympathetic villains who dont even hold a candle to the good ones that came before.
even if the original daphne didn t have much  she has been given more over the years. saying the  until now  line feels wrong to me.
scooby doo and the 13 ghost. she also awesome in thatseries.
what I hate the most is what they did to shaggy he was a gymnast not a stoner. it was only developed into that later when there was a big hippie movement.
@red j  honestly I think he just burns a lot of calories with all the running is why he has the appetite he does
nuff said
Jesus loves you
mystery inc. was a great show in all fairness. it was modern enough for technology but still classic in the stories for the most part
in d d terms  she is the party rouge  has a wide skillset knowlege  finds secret doors  picks locks  even serves as the heart of the group. velma is like a wizard  being smart and having a fantastic but niche set of problem solving tools. fred is the face of the party and the engineer when it comes to trap setting  a real artificer type. scooby shaggy act as the ranger   bard of the party with an impressive skillset that fills shat is lacking  handle animal situations  food prep and raise group morale and even serve as master performers on a regular basis.  on the surface they may look shallow  but underneath  they are a well balanced and well oiled machine of a team. although scooby   shaggy are they life of the show  there are no weak links. they all play important roles.
while you can make a fair argument that daphne didn t really have a character in the original show in the 60 s and 70 s  daphne has been extremely strongly characterized in all scooby doo media since a pup named scooby doo and that came out in the 80 s.and since the 1980 s scooby doo has had like 5 or 6 different shows and countless movies and daphne has been been strongly characterized in each one while being pivotal to their plots.  she s arguably the most important character in scooby doo zombie island  you know the film that made scooby doo relevant again the character description saying this about daphne isn t just illogical  why would a show want to tear down the reputation of a franchise when said reputation is the only reason people will watch this show  its blatantly untrue and demonstrates that the writers either haven t seen any scooby doo media in the last 30 years or they dont care.  this they honestly believe that character description  they dont know anything about daphne.
daphne was scottish nobility  and liked karate  also used her knowledge of fashion frequently to help velma build traps and fine clues
what you said about the original being a way to escape from the politics of the world hit me. like thats so true for me as a fan of the og...
the more I see about this show the more I feel like it was actually going to be an entirely different show  but hbo wb whoever wouldn t green light it unless it was a familiar property  which Ive seen someone else say  as well .
I feel like all of mindy whatever her faces writing is based in the fact thatshe s almost good looking and is just really jealous of everyone else hahahha. thats how her writing and comedy comes off.
at least with the tomb raider reboot trilogy they were telling a story from before lara had ever killed another person  so there was something to go off of from there.  its not perfect  but I enjoyed the fresh take in that instance.  I didn t feel like they went out of their way to try to not make her hot or pretend otherwise  just thatshe wasn t as confident as we know her to be from back in the og games where she s well-established and experienced by the start.
I just realized. mandy was saying she felt like velma basically...so why are the other characters being changed as if no one felt like them  even in the trailer  velma does not sound or act like velma to me. there s one thing about making the show more comedic  then there is just...dumbing a character down for chuckles and giggles. its the same thing they did in team titans go! and Im still surprised its lasted longer than itshould ve.also  dafuq is poortown  I thought they lived in coolsville.
velma writers  daphne is now raised by two moms. me  wow  how very stunning and brave of you.
hmm.  let s just recap a little bit oh  a trail of paint leading to a secret room where forged art is created   good eye  daphne.oh  you found a key to unlock the door to the secret magic shop  revealing the phantom to be just a magician   good find  daphne.oh  the cigar store indian is hollow and could hold something important   like a map   good observation  daphne.what s that   you spotted movement on scooby s tracker as he speeds helplessly toward a train   good save  daphne.oh  youremembered the ghost clown s hypnosis involved a coin despite being in a trance   solid memory  daphne.
Ive been saying this forever.  they see feminity as weak and masculinity as toxic.  their goal is to blend us into some weird mashup of the two and make us all the same.
daphne was actually pretty smart in the original cartoons  yeah she s pretty but she had a personality.
the scooby gang were based on the cast of the classic sit-com  the many loves of dobie gillis . daphne was based on tuesday weld s character thalia menninger  who was the rich and beautiful popular girl. velma was based on brilliant but nerdy zelda gilroy. fred was based on dobie gillis  and shaggy on wacky beatnik maynard krebs    played by   gilligan s island  star bob denver.  the series was a homage to the 1950s   beat  culture.
at this point they should just make a video game called  woke it up  where you get a title of a movie or a book and you just make all these random changes and get points for it!
this show is the definition of self-insert  mindy wanted a new show  knew no network would approve itso instead she came up with the idea to hijack an ip and disguise her new show in it.
these writiers should have really watched all of movies for scooby doo  cause if they think she didn t have a personality other than pretty girl then there just flat out wrong  wont say she didn t start as just cute girl in the 60 s  but like pretty much the whole gang her personality has now been fleshed out and defined
my God... so they are not gonna bring up she was extremely crafty with tools and make up  her great family connections or thatshe was is a literal world class martial artists that kick everyones ass...
so  because they have neither the intelligence  the imagination  the talent  or the creativity to create new characters and new vehicles  they have to hitch their wagons to popular and long lasting shows and characters..ones that owe their longevity to the fact that they have resonated with generations of people  young people in particular  for a very good reason and rewoke them into something unrecognisable. young people like you  who are able to reason and think for themselves  give this old gal hope for my grandkids  future.
@argus floyddaphne is scottish  that explains the red hair  and feistiness.
wow  Im not surprised anymore.
ironicly I relate to daphne more now because I was raised by 4 moms. when before all these changes I related to velma because she was the nerd of the group
@noah gooder  thats good.
@noah gooder  Im asian so I couldn t relate to any of these characters  but I still enjoyed the characters  especially scooby doo.
beginning to think that most of the woke creatives have a lesbian fetish because it is almost always swapping in that direction.
I have never given a moments consideration of a cartoon characters parental situation
@francis hoang  dont have to be the same race to identify with them.  Im a black dude but I relate more to old school velma more than the others minus the smarts xd
they raceswapped shaggy and he goes by his government name now  scooby is totally nuked off the show as not existing  velma s now a self insert for her new voice south asian lesbian   daphne is east asian
didn t they did that in a military ad
its crazy how these people think that a character has to look like you in order to relate to them  but racists gonna be racist or whatever
@tatteredshield  ong
@francis hoang  Im indian  I could relate to all the characters as a child. character is what s important  connecting with their personality.
2 in the stunning and 1 in the brave
@noah gooder  say what now
@minniemin  yep 4 polyamourous lesbian mothers 3 boomers and a silent gen. each with differing levels of masculinity and femininity.
@doug d  you have imagination and empathy. good signs you aren t a sociopath or narcissist.
@minniemin  best part the most masculine one is the 81 year old silent gen
getting rid of peoples fathers is hip and cool
@doug d  youre right of course  however  I was using the definition of  relate  based on the previous posts definition of  relate   which seemed to be skin colour  ethnicity  lgbtq sexual orientation  etc... I like movies from any country as long as its good  because the human condition is universal.
@francis hoang  I agree completely. I really hope that the show will be able to elevate universal notions about the human condition.... but I am skeptical that they will given the track record for hollywood these past 4 years. everything seems to be about tearing down existing characters and worlds.
@eisenzwerg  oh they definitely have a lesbian fetish  if them suddenly changing velma to a lesbian proves anything.
@noah gooder   I was raised by 8 moms. can we get much higher  - not-whitebeard probably
@billy the butcher  well technically 2 were aunts but they also said to call them mom
when the statement was made about daphne having two moms it all started to click.
@noah gooder  if yourelate to daphne just cause she has 2 moms  then that just says a lot more about you. how sad.
@tatteredshield  I dont think they re racist  just ignorant. its clueless people thinking they re helping.
@noah gooder  actually  having a poly character and doing it well would be brave. poly is still a controversial taboo.
@keyki  nobody cares. its cuz of y all this is happening
@noah gooder  family does what family does. but even with 2 mothers in a relationship  I am surprised they supported anyone other then themselves telling you to call them mom.
@bruce  true
@chauvin took a knee 4blm  you cared enough to comment to me  you cared enough click on a video with similar views to me. apparently people care and no its not cause of me or people like me this happens. its cause folks who dont have the talent or ability to make something good themselves have to steal viewership or a existing fandom to  try  to make themselves and their crappy ideas I thing. you can like thatstuff and I honestly say more power to you and Im happy when one of the sjws get their own stuff  owl house  steven universe etc  so just continue making your own stuff and dont steal fanbases for your ideals or continue to be a troll  have a nice day friend
@keyki  aww did I hurt your feelings. isn t it funny how you immediately played victim! is that all your kind can do are you ever going to realize that these ppl are legit just copying you
@chauvin took a knee 4blm  I ll bite  how and when did I ever play victim here
@noah gooder  I related to the character a lot despite having a mom and dad and them not being like me  but let s ignore that.
they stole emma s moms! omg!
@keyki  absolutely agree about the lack of talent and how entertainment is hijacked by those with no talent or creative vision . remember when shows were about kids fun. now its about  positive  eugenics. canadian govt. did this back in the 60s w trudeau govt.
@j b  Imean there are folks that want thatshit  I just cant understand why these project keep getting greenlit  like who in the higher ups hasn t noticed the trend with this stuff. is it case of bad publicity is still publicity  these shows get ratio d  canceled  memed but some how they never pick up on the criticism.
@keyki  I agree with that. how does it get greenlight. imo as soon as the idea of  changing  a character comes up   in this climate  any objection might and could lead to the ostrisizing of the objection. maybe the industry figures no one will notice or care. or its a sleezy   positive eugenics ploy. in a generation all people will remember is the latest newest reiteration of an old story. 1st step of eugenics. next generation its solidified as the norm. marketing 101 on a civic scale.
@keyki  exactly lol. you got folded
@chauvin took a knee 4blm  you are not making sense  when did I play victim or are you trolling
yeah she was great
wow  never knew that.  thanks for the info.  I cantotally imagine bob denver as shaggy!
how do people not know these things about scooby-doo    maynard g. krebs!sigh  one more childhood cartoon ruined by  well-meaning  people that have no clue.
gee  hana-babera recycled other people s ideas to make a cartoon...who would ve guessed.  p
@peter janssen  not really the point he was trying to make  lol!
@mike b.  they must not have visited velma s and daphne s fan websites. velma s also mentioned I love a mystery as an inspiration from  radio.
they hate pretty girls  red head girls  and pretty much anything thats not their woke flavor of the month.and after all this is done they whine about why no one watched their shows.  boycottvelma  boycottmindy
they attempted to  fix  daphne when she already had a glow up as a character already. in the early beginning of scooby doo  she used to be a damsel in distress  but later on in years  she s been turned into her own person  and pretty much is an all star player in the mystery gang when it came to facing monsteryly costumed criminals. and better yet  as an asian girl  I favored her out of the gang for her whole character. I dont see the need to race-swap her if it was intended to be represented for us asians.
as far as I know. daphne was 18 velma was 15 she was the youngest. an she grew over the seasons an when she became 16 she ran her own store.
for anyone that wanted to watch a modern scooby doo show  just watch what s new scooby doo and mystery incorporate  not only they re more faithful to the og source material but  they re also worth more everyone s time.
if it weren t for double standards  they d have none.   a perfect summary for hollywood.
she was the stylin girl and the brave one. why do they get surprised when something gets canceled after one season when its garbage
what would womanhood do without hollywood writers....
these characters were young adults..... that has a job of solving mysteries. they worked together to get paid. fred someone with a plan of catching the bad guy. velma the one who figure out the clues. dathane someone who is girly but keeps the group together. shaggy hangs out his best bud scooby. how canthey screw that up
honestly  why dont they just make their own new show  they could literally be pen pals to the original scooby crew if they want to tie it into the scooby universe. its pretty flipping easy to do  they d in actuality have to change very little to what they re currently doing  probably just the names  and mission accomplished.
daphne was always the one in need of saving. she was always there to play the helpless victim.
daphne can fight  she can also sing and rich parents  but her parents wouldn t approve of fred. she has amazing personality empathy same goes for shaggy scooby is comedic velma is smart fred is leader with trap plan mindy definitely did no research she probably didnt watch mystery incorporated  my favourite
Im just stunned they blacked the brunette and not the redhead.also daphne was the curious go-getter of the group. which is what usually landed her into trouble cause she was the first to pick up a cursed idol or go nosing around a haunted place. in addition to thatshe s adept at picking locks and martial arts. why do I know about a character on a show I haven t watched in 20 years and why did everyone before them treat her with more respect than the vandals in charge of  velma
last I checked daphne had her own arc throughout the entire series where she changed from  damsel in distress  to a  boss girl  while still being likeable lol having many skills shown throughout the series and proving herself as a valuable member of the group each character has their own qualities that make the mystery gang what it is and it is the reason why they are timeless and can still be appreciated by kids today.
listening to your voice  you sound like you d make a great velma voice actress.
the best part about daphne was thatshe was a pretty popular girl  but instead of just being a ditzy snob  she was actually pretty clever at times throughout scooby-doo. she actually cared about each of her friends on the team. she didn t need to be changed  she was already a pretty good character. I hate this woke garbage that keeps getting by shoved down our throats. it always fails. this whole thing will fail  and then we ll all get blamed for the shows failure  meanwhile  nobody asked for it.
daphne s new backstory sounds like fred s story in scooby-doo mystery incorporated
daphne was a top-tier martial artist an ace reporter and a diamond dozen entrepreneur thats kind of weird why they would change this
this saddens me.  I loved all of those characters as a kid.
did no one at hbo watch scooby-doo on zombie island  the best animated scooby-doo movie of all time. she was a well established reporter and was the forefront for mystery inc after the gang went their separate ways. also  the live action movies  sarah michelle gellar  she was the only one that could defend herself. y all remove all the traits fans love about the characters
essentially that interview quote was tell me you ve never watched scooby doo without telling me you ve never watched scooby doo. cause daphne was always smart and extremely good at many skills the other members of the gang weren t well versed in. also why is it that the people creating this show are stating things that just aren t true like velma being under appreciated and or  unsung  velma is literally the fucking brains of the operation and solves a lot of the mysteries explaining it in a way for others to understand.
see  its jealousy
Im surprised they didn t race swap her.. being red head and what not.
@managuabrother  they did. apparently she s asian now.
whats wrong with red hair its a minority group
their pc flavor of the month. woke is a far right buzzword. it has no meaning.
its really surprising they blackwashed velma instead of her  since pedowood always does that to gingers.
@clean  which is actually slightly against the meme because usually they race swap white red heads to black
@cellmate  nope the blackwashed one is shaggy... velma s indian from india
@ladywizard  oh my mistake.
@ladywizard  indian isn t a race.
@lex ruptor  there s this thing called  english language  that you should look into.
@shadowman  perhaps she should have said whatever the race is that makes up that part of the world....crossbred asian and middle eastern    or is it that race doesnt exist  are do you mean that indian citizens can be of any race
@lex ruptor  I thought wokeism came from the left. they re the ones who call themselves that. sjw was also originally a term that came from tumblr.
flourish and grow in depth and complexity rather than being stereotyped or forcefully steered into a singleminded direction  much like men in the current cultural zeitgeist . sorry  that was rhetorical wasn t it  lol.
@patrick quick  no way. without hollywood women would be lost!
a lot.
another good question  what would friendship do without hollywood writers  notice how in the article itseems like the show is going for a daphne x velma thing. why cant two people just be friends  why does everything always have to be about trying to have sex with someone
exist
@brandonheat243  dean   they do know we re brothers  right  sam   doesnt seem to matter. supernatural s4e18
be better human beings. maybe even contribute to society s true growth as a species.
survive.
@thatharvguy  great reference. I love the episodes that put them in contact with their stories fans. lets not forget they went into a scooby doo episode too. dean trying to hit on daphne was always too funny that episode.
for some reason I read this in the drinker s voice
exist unadulterated.
exist
honestly idk
@brandonheat243  these weirdos   omg men dont know how to be affectionate with each other!! toxic masculinity!!these same weirdos when men are being good friends and showing affection   omg they showed they care about each other!!! they must be gay!!! see also  the supernatural fandom  be cautious if searching for sam and dean winchester or dean winchester and castiel
@patrick quick  it really depends on what that women believes cause this girl has a pretty good idea of what scooby-doo should be
thrive and be happier
@bryce spencer  awsome .. I want hes review or it now
velma isn t black. she s south east asian...
technically she pulls out marshall arts in the scooby-doo and the cyber chase. its a blink and you ll miss it moment  but its there. not to mention tricking the creeper in that movie several times.Im pretty sure they did self defense with her in some other animated properties too  and Im not even all that well researched on scooby doo.more proof that people dont really care about writing a story that imitates what went before  only about making trash that appeals to their ego.
worse than that  20 movies came out after zombie island  each showing daphne having macgyver skills and martial arts as well as being quite competent.
smg s fight against the mexican wrestler guy was iconic
there is so much different interpretations of scooby-doo. the reason why those work is because there was little to no change. Im genuinely afraid of what they ll do to scooby-doo. just look at what they done to animaniacs.
that was such a good movie.
that movie honestly wasn t my favorite at all I really didn t like the voice cast
sex sells is never a main focus when it comes to scooby-doo. like yeah daphne is canonically the prettier of the girls but most fans preferred velma. they never sexualized them to make them marketable because this gang of kids and their dog were just always amazing. we need them to get better which they did.daphne was no longer the damsel in distress. she became a martial artist  lock picker  macgyver in purple and high heels  her fashion knowledge has helped them not only solve cases but also provide the team with necessary clothing.the only scooby-doo show in recent years that didn t do the team justice is that last one where itseems everyone lost some braincells
most versions of the characters from scooby-doo were 17 to  early 20. but wb kinds try to record how the old the characters are example being zombie island 2
I would like to see what the person who changed  improved  velma looks like. did they do a self-insert like many other  woke  people do  eg. like the artists writers who did  I am starfire   and the she-ra reboot   or are they the very out-of-shape type who just hate athletic healthy people. these people shouldn t be handling these characters  they are only interested in pushing their own messages.
yeah definitely was a good character and one of my favorite scooby-doo shows is mystery incorporated
I come from a time growing up where I never needed a character to look like me to  feel represented.  I just needed a well written or otherwise fun character to be able to like them. Ive never complained that there aren t enough gingers in the shows I watch  or ever wanted to change an established character into a ginger  so I really dont get why these people making these new reboots felt the need to do it. also  yes thats exactly what I picture when I think of norville rogers. besides  velma was born in germany. she s german-american. this is literally just a different character they slapped her name on and dressed her up as. fred is apparently non-binary now as well  so yeah. as you can see  they dont care about the characters at all  they just care about representation and the shield they think it gives them from critism.
Im younger than most here  so I didn t really grew up with this show  I barely even watched cartoons  da vincI learning was your cartoon network   but wb s newer series still get that og vibe  keeping the lore and basics the same.Im really enjoying the show now  because you have stereotypical people with a weird  rather hobby  helping  understanding and complimenting each other. and you have the icon of course scooby. reincarnation of me as a dog. literally. its so refreshing and funny.no offense  I support gay people  but please. make your own spin-off and dont ruin what you watched as kids. have they even watched it  I bet no.
to make matters worse  apparently they re saying thatshe is not attracted to fred when Im pretty sure thats been consistent through most of scooby-doo history
this show is so different there is literally no reason for them to use the scooby ip. they could ve made the characters all original and said it was loosely inspired by the old hanna barbera mystery show. at this point I think they did it just to get people mad for publicity.
in scooby   scrappy daphne was the main detective because fred   velma were not on that team for a bit.
good vid.true fans and people who want true diversity. will demand new original characters. Im sure these creators would say they would be worried about copying or being a knockoff  but if they would make good stories with engaging characters then all kinds of people would watch and become fans. I would be interested in watching a group like the scooby gang  with maybe a middle eastern tough guy leader  an indian pretty girl  an asian philosophical dude and black smart girl. super diverse  but if done right could be really cool too. hay maybe meet the original scooby gang   no race swapping and complicated childhood . why they cant see how doing this is better than  lazily race swapping and story telling and how it would check all boxes and bring people together  I truly dont know.
all I can say is Im grateful for all the years and movies of scooby doo that came out before this bs started happening. still had a great childhood
no wonder why scooby doesnt want be there. I feel you dawg.
yo mells ! kudos to you girl   love what your doing and I love your face too ! all the best to you !
they cant stand each other but they re just all riding in the same car
I remember running home from school just to watch scooby doo now they ve brought it to ruins
Im kinda getting major  daphne is obviously asian because she did martial arts and her family had ties to asia  vibes
hbo max   I didn t learn a thing from santa inc. Im going make a mockery of something else that people really like. the fans   how many times do we have to teach you this lesson  old man !
hbo easily could have expanded on characters backstories and maybe played with adding a   woke   episode or something like that but tbh seems like a limited license since they can  t use scooby.
in my opinion best dafney was from the zombie island movie saga were she had her own mystery solving show and new self defence. now Im not saying that was the greatest because all incarnation  bar the new one  were competent and had skills hell mystery inc is my second favourite but in honesty I like all the old ones.
I always thought daphne was cool. I thought she was strong  smart and pretty. she wasn t running around getting high  losing their glasses  and generally screwing everything up like the rest of the gang.
noo  did you say fred is non binary   omggg  this shit never ends!!
I feel bad for the kids growing up with this garbage
@keyki  yes  I will be showing my kids just the good stuff
yes!!! lol
hbo max  I love the young people
there s a lot of changes. I wonder if this was originally going to be a show that was in a similar vein of scooby-doo  but not an official sd show. I could see wb just giving them approval to make it legit. just a thought. I liked the trailer btw.
your awesome girl. keep spitting the truth on these sickening people.
this whole show honestly feels like a slap in the face to og fans of scooby doo and when fans gave mindy kaling criticism over the show and her version of velma basically being a self insert character she responded in a very unprofessional way by basically saying  this is my show so deal with it . also some other things that fans dont like is how they cut out scooby doo who is the face of the franchise and the team behind the velma series said that a talking dog wouldn t work in this adult series they re doing and if you look at the description for fred they made him into a joke essentially cuz they said that he s 16 and hasn t hit puberty yet and daphne is getting tired of him and also that he takes credit for others work while in other versions of scooby doo he didn t take credit for others work and would essentially be thrilled and boast about his traps when they worked.
have these guys ever watched the 13 ghosts of scooby doo  for crying outloud  fred and velma were nowhere to be found in thatseries  but daphne was right there in the mix  taking on the most dangerous villains scooby doo had faced up to that point  except maybe joker and penguin .
there was nothing to daphne  she had an amazing character arc. she went from a ditzy damsel in distress to a knowledgeable certified badass. how is that nothing
they made her a nervous wreck because they are too and cant tell the difference between confident and sociopathic.
daphne will always look so damn fine    my fav character
the 2015 series   be cool  scooby-doo   had a lot of problems  trying to hard to be goofy  with family guy art. but thatseries at least only made everyone a parody of their original selves. they didn t go out of their way to make any one character particularly idiotic  or humiliated. this one just wants to spit on scooby-doo and make yellow-face velma wonderful.
Ive studied enough of cartoons to know that the more abstract the character remains  the more appealing they are to a universal audience.  they are drawn simply and have some simple definable traits.  charlie brown is drawn simply  he is a melancholic child.  if he deviates from this  or is suddenly drawn different and swaps his gender and suddenly has a complicated back story  it ruins charlie brown.
mindy k has been trying to get her hands on playing velma for years  her instagram post showed this and the caption was this is my story!!! told my way!!! Im surprised this survived the chopping block.
I could have sworn daphne had a dad and a mom in  a pup named scooby-doo
haha let s be real  velma lost her figure cos they re trying to portray a  real  woman s figure. I also feel already like velma s actual personality has been swapped with a dumber woke version. she was always the brains as far as I remember.
itsounds like these  creators  have a vague memory of a few episodes from the original series  if that.  there have been several other iterations of the series since the original  each adding their own little spin  but never messing with the basic formula  because it wasn t necessary.  I watched mystery incorporated with my kids a few years back.  they loved it  and I got a kick out it.  all the characters had backstory and arcs that fit well with the characters we ve known for years.  I can understand the race swap  change for the times  attract a new audience and all that.  but dont forget about the audience that is the reason this show is popular and memorable enough to still be around.  this assertion that these characters were just hollow vessels until this point  waiting to be  fixed   is baseless.
I never understood the term popular for a certain group. like she said the popular kids hang out together  the nerds do  etc. so what makes the  popular  people popular if they only have friends in their group. the nerds are just as popular in their own group. never understood that.
they really cant stop coming after everything we love.
melonie is like the cool big sister I wish I had
so daphne has trouble being raised by two mothers  imagine the irony of that
velma looks like the sad emotion from that pixar movie
I couldn t find any art for scooby  if he is even part of the series  but I was curious to ask anyone who reads this  if they had race swapped or gender swapped scooby  made him a chihuahua or rhodesian ridgeback for example  would you be as upset or more upset as you are about the other race changes   not sure how I would feel but curious of other people s opinions.
this will be one of those shows you want to watch simply to see how bad it will be
they described fred as  defined by his whiteness . if thats not blatantly racist I dont know what is.
@silver scorpio  they re more than likely making him the joke character given his description and what they said about him and I find it ironic that the only white character in mystery inc. has a description that essentially bashes him and makes him seem like a winey person.
well its made my idpol ideologues. of course they re gonna demean and bash the straight white guy. if they could  they d turn him into the true villain by the end of the series.in the meantime I wouldn t be surprised if he wont be the one that makes everything fail and the group would be better off without him.
I had a look at the  new fred  I think they deliberately made him look dumb   an imbecile.that is probably a racial attack.
the reason it feels like a slap to the face is because it is. every time an ip gets a  modern  update is a slap to the face.
fred was always kinda boring to me but even I know he was a good leader whever shaggy velma or daphne did something cool or helpful he was the first to say  great job  he was never selfish never
@keung wan  I had the exact same feeling when I first saw his poster and also I dont know why it looks like he s in a different art style compared to daphne and norville  shaggy
so they went from himbo fred to cliche white teen stereotype fred  how hip and cool
no no  I want to hear more about his family trauma.
charlie is every kid that had a bad day  who got let down  or did not understand something. he was every kid.
@orlokk noxx show  in other words  the phrase that every creator needs to hear as a reminder when they go too far on things keepitsimplestupid
oh no  now they re going to go after charlie brown!
cultural vandalism
hollywood magic
scooby was a boy and his dog story.  fred and daphne were basically eye candy  velma was the brain  but the main characters with the most background were scoob and shaggy.
my grandparents would be sad if they were alive today. they watched these as kids.
daphne was the type ppl wanted to hate but couldn t because she didn t fit the mold anybody assumed for her. in thier constant attempts to appear righteous they continually perpetuate the very things they claim to stand against.
when laziness is a  feature   you just know its gonna be  good .
mystery inc was the breakfast club. the jock  fred   the prep  daphne   the basket case  shaggy   the nerd  velma   and the criminal  scooby doo .
ty @ mistress9 thats what I remember about the gang that each one of their characters used their knowledge at the end to solve the mystery and catch the bad person. each and everyone of them had qualities and were good friends .they could have added new characters even they wanted to add more diversity.  I can see why they can not have scooby but I did not know it was for adults .
I have noticed this too  increasingly in movies the women are plump  plain  short etc.  its like they have a real specific person in mind for every role  eliminating classically beautiful women.
I love how melanie always brings things back to lara craft. you cantell how much them ruining the character irks her
I loved be school daphne and fraphne as a couple. I wont let any stupid show to destroy that.
when they say  forget everything you know  about x character  it just makes me ask why not make another character.
hold up  its a scooby-doo show without scooby  what
you have over 50 versions of scooby-doo let hbomax have this God damn one
yup saw this coming  there s no way fred and daphne were gonna also make it in without getting changed. let us just consider ourselves blessed thatscooby got saved from being in this mess of a show.
lol.  they weren t happy enough to  I ll say establish  because we never thought about a high schoolers sexual preference before  establish velma s sexual preference  but they have to -  of course - have daphne have two moms.  are fred and shaggy going to get into a relationship  or are we going to normalize bestiality with scoob instead
scooby doo is my favorite childhood cartoon of all time. I loved each and every one of the gang and they each brought something unique to their group  none of them were boring. this is our reality now with movies  television and video games all going to shit because people who want to be  woke   inclusive  politically correct etc while those very same people couldn t care less about what they preach. its all     we know it  they ever know it  but no one can dare say a thing about it because they ll be crucified as a villain. when I saw this trailer is absolutely crushed me
finally a based female figure on youtube  I love your views keep up the good fight
remember when daphne learned karate and kicked the butt of a pro wrestler twice her size all because she was sick of being a damsel and wanted to be taken seriously.
she already was fixed way before this but they just dont want to acknowledge the improvements.
same old story  we re fresh out of ideas  so we re going to take something you like and turn it into something we like ...  then berate you when you dont watch it.
scooby now associates as a cat.
fred and daphne were fairly simple characters  but what matters is that they worked  they functioned just fine  same as shaggy and scooby.
@pinkceo  for years  fans were sure that fred was gay and velma was asexual.
@chad reynolds  only people who have no idea of how society was portrayed in the 50 s and 60 s would think that  i.e. millennials and younger.
everyone has their favorites. nothing wrong with that. its part of her charm.
what was wrong with lara
@themitsinga  og lara or the new one  the og lara was a confident wisecracking superhero like a hybrid of indiana jones   the detective plutocrat aspects of batman. nu lara is an over emotional mess who comes off like a damsel in distress yet she somehow kills everybody anyway.  the writing for new lara is just random.
@max master j  nu lara is also gay now  stunning and brave
I was wondering was she taking about the series from 2013 or is there a new lara croft game thatshe is talking about
@max master j  Ive played all tomb raider games and the only one thatslightly annoyed me was legend  because you had two dudes constantly yapping in lara s ear. that was before the 2013 reboot  btw. non-sociopathic lara felt strange to me in the new games but I got used to it. it doesnt erase the previous games and there s room in my brain for both. shadow of the tomb raider was too  social  at times for my taste  casually walking through a crowd of people in mexico felt like the anti-tomb raider experience  and also a bit overly long  but it wasn t bad.
dont jinx it fool! now they might add scooby-doo as a female chihuahua!
@flaming bearded dragon  a female chihauhau that likes female st. bernards.
@fred gilbert  obviously
happens every time
so.... ubisoft at this point.
exactly!!!
I always saw fred and daphne as the prom king and queen  velma was the cute nerd  shaggy was the stoner  and scooby was a big ass dog. they made shaggy black with dreadlocks. I wonder if he sounds like jar jar binks  that could be problematic.. lol
I find it interesting that the one character they didn t race-swap was the popular  jock group leader.
in honor of the original and halloween  I ll go watch the original shows and the early movies of scooby doo.
this scooby doo remake is getting more attention than the recently heightened threat of literal nuclear armageddon and thatscares me.
daphne had  no character  like all the characters apparently have  no character . is being a stoner a character  is being a nerd a character  is beingja leader a character as far as I remember  daphne had confidence and sarcasm about her  for example. and was someone bringing common sense. and a lot of knowledge that comes from her being who she is.
didn t they try giving daphne a more complex back story in the 90 s and early 2000 s where the team splits up in the live action and after a 5-ish year skip she knows martial arts and kicks a mexican pro wrestlers ass and in the animated movies she s seen branching off into news reporting
I think its very disgusting that they re taking such a family friend loved ip and turning it into butchered woke adult filth.
the only problem I had with daphne was they tell us she is a black belt in martial arts yet always gets kidnapped
there s a fan made scooby doo called mystery inc. on youtube. you canthat they really love the series as they kept true to the characters. they are doing by crowdfunded to help develop future episodes.
I guess hbo max never saw scooby doo on zombie island which each character were given more fullness as a character. specially daphne that turns into a reporter and velma which got a book store
I love how you brought up how they dont respect the ip and the source material bc they cant make anything original so they shit on an already successful franchise and it just disappoints me bc Ive loved this franchise since I was a child
loved the part when velma yelled   its velma time!   and proceeded to german suplex the masked villain through a table. truly awe inspiring. sent chills down my spine.
hasn t anyone ever heard of  if it ain t broke dont fix it   so sad we live in a time where people feel it necessary to change everything from the past that people cherish so much only to destroy it.
funny that they say  there was nothing to know  ... then follow by explaining things that doesnt ever factor in most scoobydoo episodes.  the 1  would prove them wrong  so they choose to ignore it
thinking about it...daphne had the more developed backstory of all the characters in all scooby media...I d argue even more than shaggy!
mindy kaling made velma look like her  maybe the  abandonment issues  are probably her issues. instead of making real characters or using the characters that are already established  they just write themselves into each role  cuz they do not have actual writing skills.
hbo scooby-doo production crew   forget everything you know about daphne blake me   so you want me to forget that in scooby-doo and the cyber chase daphne was a strong-willed sassy reporter with a supermodel body like april o neal from the tmnt and in the original cartoon in the first couple of episodes before they started focusing on her character daphne was really just kind of a bland characterless piece of eye candy sure done now let s see what you got hbo sd crew  post a picture on twitter of daphne naked and covering herselfme   ... what the fuck hbo   !!!
now  modern audiences  will love her!will they
love it thank you for saying it as it is
in mystery inc. daphne was given a much smarter story arc and actually solved several of the mysteries over the 2 seasons thatshow ran. she was already epic. http   popcornunhinged.blogspot.com 2013 08 scooby-doo-mystery-incorporated-season.html
that was prob my only problem with daphne too being  danger prone  kidnapped besides thatshe was great
about as much as a day spent in the bathroom  barfing up a lung because they ve got the flu......
as a fan of scooby-doo myself Im actually going to say I dont really mind the whole race swapping thing especially since shaggy s character actually looks like he could have been a member of the original scooby-doo gang with just the way he was designed he has the same kind of facial structure as the original shaggy so I really dont mind though the big blaring question in the room is where the hell is scooby-doo that is what we need where is scooby-doo
I remember that daphne is a martial artist who takes on masters and luchachdors
my favorite version was the live action scooby-doo movies where she just kicked ass cause she was tired of the save me trope. notice then there wasn t a whole rah rah we re making a strong woman motive behind it or promoting the movie. it was just that version of her character and it worked. Ive said it before and I ll say it again  if you want a lasting impactful proper representation that anyone can enjoy write a good character first. if your first intention is appealing to a demo or to seem progressive your character is paper thin.
well it could be worse  they could have scooby and shaggy in a physical relationship and they could use the  song puppy love as a theme
this velma show is going to be nothing but ass. raised by two female officers and no one s surprised
og crew vs the velma fire  fred makes a plan  velma provides information  daphne keeps them from getting thrown out immediately despite shaggy eating the entire pantry.  which he then trips over something and discovers a hidden stair case.   scoob does what he can. velma apparently has an issue with people getting killed. the older series side stepped the murder issue to a degree simply because we all kind of understood thatscooby is a great dane. as much as he was a coward it was understood that was only to a degree. find his threshhold and cowardly dog could turn into an assault horse. thus the villains kept to jump scares mostly with a sideline in occasional kidnapping. cause murder carries heavier prison time and a much higher risk of dog bites.
at this point they might as well have just created a brand new franchise with completely different characters. oh but that wouldn t sell as well as something with the scooby-doo label.
this reminds me of when people try to  fix  others art.
the writer be like   the old daphne was a daredevil girl and the bravest of the team  she always got imformation from others and was a martial artist  at least in more modern shows... but thats not a personality. now our daphne is diverse  now thats personality.the entire scooby doo community   bruh...
love your content soooo much!!
when I first saw the characters I only noticed velma being different. I noticed fred was the same and thought daphne was too since I focused on shaggy which said norville and thought he was a new character as he doesnt look like shaggy at all. so with daphne I only noticed she was there with red hair and purple shirt. my thoughts was why did they change velma  I also heard she was gonna be lesbian to which I thought she had moments in the show where it was hinted she and shaggy was a pair so wouldn t it make more sense for her to be bisexual instead  introducing same sex relationships while not breaking the established relationships. later I noticed norville was shaggy and I was utterly confused as hell. he doesnt even have the same hairstyle nor give off the same vibe. then I noticed daphne had more of a yellow skin tone than the others and slanted eyes and I was like why  if they re gonna make a more inclusive mystery gang why not just have the old gang retire and bring in new characters that take over. or maybe just a new gang that doesnt take over  but works as sort of a friendly rival team to the og. this is just saying we want to be inclusive  but we dont want to put in any effort.
they changed so much that they could have literally made an entirely new ip with different character names and whatnot.
in ruby and spears  original series Bible  fred and shaggy are each 17 years old  daphne is 16  and velma is 15.
other iterations made her smart she had character she really didn t need all this
I grew up watching scooby doo.you know hollywood   not every character needs a ton of  depth    trauma   everything!even though she does have some depth  when I was young  I didn t care about any of it!  same for all the other characters!I understood who they were  what they were like   was entertained by watching them have zany adventures!  full stop.that was all that was needed.  so  knock it off!
the dude who said daphne was there to be sexy was probably some dude whose only prior interaction with the scooby doo franchise was to be too much intibdrooling over sarah michelle gellar and linda cardenellI while watching scooby doo movie to get the plot .
daphne has a mother and father. their names are elizabeth and nedley blake.
fun fact  in case no one said already  scooby doo does not appear in this new scooby doo spinoff.
Im actually not upset at  velma  the show.  I do like the premise of solving an actual murder of a high schooler kid with their brain missing.  scooby doo has so many remakes  individual movies  and art styles that there really is no such thing as scooby doo canon at this point.  you can really just treat this show as part of a scooby doo multiverse   like they are in a different dimension of scooby doo.   Im actually looking forward to  velma.   it probably wont last more than 1 season  but I do like the premise of solving a murder instead of guys with monster masks.
I think they ve never seen scooby doo and have only ever seen robot chicken skits
you can literally smell it from afar
now it would be avant-garde if a character was the biological child of a happily married husband and wife.
also has complicated feelings for velma.
@james goodman   surely it cant be done!
@strenuousspider  of course she does. why wouldn t she in modern woke media. wouldn t be surprised I by the end she ends up with velma  shaggy comes out as trans or something  or at the least a complete simp  and fred is actually the real villain  jealous of the new power couples relationship or something oh so very clever.
@james goodman  she was kidnapped by lesbians who demanded the  right  to have a kid
@eisenzwerg  soon bugs bunny and other childhood shows are gonna be gay  trans  sjws and maybe all of the above
yeah idk why they made velma lesbian her being bImade more sense
forget everything you know about  character . translation  we re going to get this character completely wrong and expect you to be okay with that.
I guess they never watched the crystal cove series cause she did have a fleshed out personality in that
they ve finally gotten to a franchise that I hold near and dear. my outrage was big enough already with other stories I didn t even have much of a foot in. now I feel the sadness of those before me. I genuinely do not know when this crusade of theirs will end.
7 05 thats based af. shout-out to hollywood for at least keeping it real there
now would be a good time to start watching stuff outside of hollywood
2 40 thatsounds like every dnd backstory.
melonie is one of two women that are so bomb I just cant help but simp for. the other being june aka shoeonhead.
what I heard is that velma is not black  but south asian  or something. which is because she s a stand in for one of the persons writing the show  who just so happens to also be the same person voicing the character. so  not a self insert  guys  trust me. lol
scooby-doo came on when I was 8.  by the time I was 10 I thought velma was an amazing nerd and I had a crush on daphne who was not  merely  there to look hot as she solved many mysteries as the show continued on.  in the film scooby-doo on zombie island  daphne had a very successful investigative tv series called  coast to coast with daphne blake  on a fictional channel called  americana.
the entire franchise is being attacked.and the daphne in  be cool scooby-doo  had a lot of personality.
I dont think there was anything wrong with the original scooby cast. but if guess when they screw up the new series I ll still have the original episodes to go back to
reimagined for modern audiences  nearly always translates to  will not be remembered by future audiences.
velma creators   our daphne is asian  so now asians can be represented! their daphne  has red hair when actual asians have black hairvelma creators   shaggy is now black  and we used his real name! their shaggy  looks like a racist stereotype of black peoplevelma creators   we made velma black and made her chubby! their velma  looks like a black version of meg griffon
just goes to show that this show may not turn out great  especially considering that  as seen in the trailer that came out recently  the producers will make fun of our complaints in the show because  haha cope.
complicated feelings for velma. here we go again.
its like d d characters... everyone has to have a tragic  broken background story. people never come to the table and say  my character grew up in a loving family who were happy to see me go off adventuring and are totally normal    ... and then they were murdered by orcs     no  they re happily retired. Im going back next month for a happy family reunion    ... where everyone is going to be murdered by orcs  right     ummmm... nope. no orcs. uncle joe might drink too much if that helps
tbh daphne was pretty much a type of peak female empower. marital arts  many social links and having rich parents allows her to assist the gang with traveling resources and vacations.  has many survival talents. so your telling me girls want that to change
when I found out she was asian and you started it talking about her new character I thought she think she was going to be like a crazy rich asian because her dad is rich as f     her dad is the reason they have the mystery machine I remember seeing thatsomewhere in one of their information things
hbo is  so stunning and brave.
even the live action daphne learned martial arts because she grew tired of being the damsel . come on
instead of making another great show like mystery inc that improve upon the characters strengths and personalities  they have to crap out more poor excuses of scooby doo knockoffs.
welcome to the club  I so far lost disney animation canon  pepe le pew and many dc characters. not everyone is gay. what is their obsession with gay people.
yes I never thought of daphne as an airhead  instead she seemed to be quite confident with her macgyver skill set
she was also the leader of the group after they reunited too. love that movie its always gonna be my favorite scooby doo movie
daphne in general had a lot of personality.
be cool scooby doo I didn t even bother watching that garbage show
@espn luver  honestly  daphne was the only good thing about it.
good to see someone else catch that
forget everything you know about daphne   .....me    why ...you gave me no reason to
preach it boo! love the commentary
a friend of mine actually looks like the og shaggy.. even his voice is very similar to the original character.. and I find this utterly ridiculous to put it nicely.. since scooby doo was basically  my childhood
6 59 why is that phrasing so funny to me  lmao
everyone who thought the treatment of scrappy doo was an abomination had no idea what was coming in 20 years.
oh man they are turning her into victoria winters from dark shadows
look at how they massacred my girl daphnee chat!  the reason why she was designed to be hot   mystery incorporated is my favourite version  was to showcase that even though she is hot  she is more than that. she is ambitious   smart  charming  cunning and caring. she always wanted to be more than just a pretty face and would do her best to solve the mysteries with the gang. she wants to be seen as an equal when decoding the mystery. loved daphnee. seeing this new design kinda hurts that charm.
it really looks like they combined scooby and shaggy  shaggy s body scooby s color.
phil lamarr voiced samuraI jack  brilliantly.
lmao Im surprised they didn t turn scooby into rodwiller or a pitbull
once you change something about an established character then automatically its a whole different character. these people dont really care about these ips  I never once watched scooby-doo and thought  this shoe I d good but it d be better if youremoved scooby  make shaggy and velma black  make daphne asian and fred a they them
I dont remember scooby doo and the gang solving murders  they solved mysteries and that was it. the mysteries were because the criminal drove away people to steal treasure  land or businesses
I ll stick to my daphne. the original and true one. I ll also stick to my velma.edit  I ll just stick with the original scooby doo. God I didn t know it was that bad.
I never had trouble relating to any character s plights because of their race or gender.if I couldn t relate it was because of the decisions they were making.I dont understand what s going on with people.
nail on the head. the entertainment industry doesnt seem to want to stay true to the original source material that is loved by the fans. they use it as a vehicle infest with thier agendas. i.e. the wheel of time  halo  the witcher  sandman  I still thought this was a good show   just to name a few. im worried about the last of us show.
always thought daphne was a rich daddies girl
velma is shaped like mindy. awesome.
its no surprise that they wait until the original creator dies before mutilating their works. over and over again without remorse. the love of money is the root of all evil.
I remember daphne being the secret badass in like everything. why would they get rid of that and give her abandonment issues
the sheer arrogance of taking well-established characters and rewriting them to fit the new narrative when they have decades upon decades of lore about them is one of the worst things we keep seeing over and over again. the same problem I have with woke video games. I also find it offensive that they take issue with the color of a character s skin or the shape of their eyes. Ive seen several of the scooby doo movies and of course the various tv series over the years  and I remember that despite the mysteries of the show being goofy that it was always a delight to watch the dynamic between these characters  daphne pulling out a stick to challenge monsters and making them run away in scooby-doo and the cyberchase   a very funny scene.edit  also  its quite possible for asian people to have red hair. Im not sure how common it actually is  but it does exist.
yeah  just ignore the facts thatshe became a successful journalist with her own talk show and her family bankrolled mystery inc in the first place.
daphne had macgyver skills in later movies and the mystery incorporated show. and I always thought of her as a badass
so well said
like...they literally could ve just made original characters and tangentially related them to the og crew. why didn t they do that
its a scooby doo spinoff show. except we dont have scooby-doo. daphne isn t anything like daphne anymore. velma isn t anything like velma anymore. shaggy at least doesnt look like shaggy anymore and probably also doesnt behave like shaggy anymore. yeah really seems like this is a scooby doo related show...
daphne is pretty  velma is smart. but daphne is not stupid  and velma is not ugly. fred is strong and shaggy has personality. but fred isn t a stiff and shaggy has charm. it was all just about perfect.... until now
when I heard about this my first question was  who asked for this   I still haven t gotten an answer.
I d say  what s new scooby doo   is the one I ll pass down. the animation wasn t my favorite but the characters had depth and I loved that they added an overarching plot versus a million random goons coincidentally dressing in monster costumes for  insert reason here .
couldn t agree more  really. I loved daphne in the early 2000s  she was super resourceful...look at how they massacred my girl. idk what s more cringe  the fact that they tried to pull a uno reverse on us with the trailer or the fact that they expected this to be received positively.
I like the way the new lara looks but I never played the old one s so I dont have anything to compare it to.
million woke points    1   small coffee
daphne has no character and has always been sexualized. proceeds to give her a character thats never been hers while sexualizing her in promo
yes ! they made velma frumpy  the brainiac was always best one !
what I find truly comical is the absence of scooby. I love the original cast  but scooby was the one who made the show. without scooby  you are taking the heart and soul out of the show.
poor fictional daphne lol
its sad that the writers of this show seem like they never watched the other versions of the gang because they dont seem to understand any of the characters. even this velma acts really out of character acting condescending and immature. I ll still give the show a try  but for me itseems more like an alternative universe of the characters. I hope it wont be one of those shows that focus just on nudity  gore  and cameos. I also hope the writing wont be bad because at this point I have low expectations.
this is what happened when you let tumblr self-insert fanfic writers handle the script.
they re ruining everything you love and unless you stop giving them your money  they will continue to do it.
lol I just had to laugh at that character bio they made up for the  new daphne   like these people have to be on some sh t because that is the goofiest and fanficition-esque sh t Ive ever heard.
daphne was also a rich kid and she and her family helped with the funding  the mystery incorporated. she was also smart  kind  and skilled in many ways out side of the stereotype. she also was my favorite since she knew martial arts.
velma s supposed to be a sexy nerd. daphne is cunning  shaggy a cowardly lucky stoner - yes  he s clearly smoking those greens - and fred the fearlness leader. you could change things if those changes were improvements on the base of the character. not... this. whatever it is. why couldn t velma just be a sexy shy ginger nerd  why cant fred just be the fearless jock  why cant daphne be the cunning blonde  why cant shaggy be... shaggy  and why does it bother you that they re all white
they race-swapped everyone except fred then made him anime probably . and removed scoob to make it less childish. what could possibly go wrong
this made me miss the original lara croft. grew up playing the first three games on pc..
ikr daphne was great in what s new scooby doo
apparently this version should be called  scooby who
@lucy hardman   that was good!
dog lives matter!
appropriate  considering they dont seem to care about making the show worthwhile  in any shape or form.
everytime I see this happen. I understand this is not scooby doo  its just a ripoff.
without scooby you are taking the heart and soul out of the show  writers  exactly! finally somebody gets it. we intend to rip the heart and soul out of everything we can get our filthy hands on
I feel wokeism can be defeated in the same way the giant mascots in the simpsons treehouse of horrors episode were  just dont look. they crave attention and if we starved it if attention it might die.
wait... there is no scooby-doo in this scooby-doo show
they re missing the point of the show  which was that these characters who have nothing in common where able to work together and be friends. these people that have to change everything are the ones who only care about looks.
at what point does hollywood realize they are just out parodying themselves with who can make the most diverse wokest story background
dahne has 50 years of canon and different interpretations. saying she has no character is such an insult to the many writers and artists who have worked on this franchise. its telling that kaling and her crew have to tear down past incarnations in order to build up their own. if their show was good  it could stand on its own without crapping on the original incarnations  which  by and large  were made for children .this thing is so removed from scooby-doo and velma that itshould have been an original ip. but they re leeching off an established franchise because nobody would care about kaling s self-insert if she didn t attach it to a beloved legacy character
they tumblr cartoon art styled velma  daphne  and shaggy  they anime styled fred.
the only scooby-doo recreation I liked was dc comics scooby apocalypse. daphne in the series was portrayed as a short-tempered  controlling news reporter  with fred as her cameraman  whom she rejects his advances. velma was a whistle-blowing scientist who set up the meeting with daphne. shaggy was just a worker who tends to the lab animals  namely the dogs  one being scooby-doo. subsequently  velma and shaggy became an item  and velma not being portrayed as a lesbian.
maybe daphne is originally from a different world like the main character in the 12 kingdom anime
8 14 thank you finally someone compared velma to meg from family guy  they literally made velma the fat joke of the show  just look at the belly! wtf self insert for mindy
I dont get how in the world hollywood is so full of itself that they re literally ruining every franchise for woke points  losing massive massive revenue in the process  and still making the same mistake over and over again. I see absolutely nothing similar to the source material at all other than the names and fred s appearance. also them suddenly making daphne and velma a thing is wildly weird  like ffs daphne and fred were always the couple.
these people hate scooby doo and feel they have to put it in a re-education camp to be acceptable for them. anyone who loves something wouldn t change it drastically.
its wild to me that they literally undercut strong female characters saying they have no personality and then them make overly strong female characters with no personality  captain marvel  she hulk
the thing about scooby doo is that its already flawlessly inclusive without even trying. the gang themselves  while yes they re all white  are all different personalities  and they ve literally seen half the world. I cant think of a person or culture they haven t included in a wholesome non problematic way. scooby doo has been ahead of its time for a long time. if they wanted to be more inclusive they could have done a show season sending them to different countries or something  but changing the gang themselves is lazy and going for shock points. scooby doo is  and has always been  perfect just the way it was.
the animation totally looks like its from total drama island
the wokeness motto  if it ain t broke  fix it.
all the cosplayers are going to be mad about velma.
what do you mean no memorabke characteristics  there s a reason everyone remembers  dangerprone daphne .because mocking the fans worked so well for he-man...
this is harley quinn  birds of prey all over again.
yet another case of  take a well-known character  totally change them but keep the name  aka brand recognition  .
I wouldn t even know daphne was asian except for it being stated lol
I dont remember much about daphne as a character from the og 60 s hannah barbera era she just usually was the damsel type from all I could remember. so much so  that it became a meme that grew self-aware over times where later iterations of scooby-doo played off that trope and were like  hey  I dont need to be the damsel I know karate now!  I think that was from the 2000 s live-action scooby-doo movies. the zombie island movie made her a reporter with fred as the cameraman. one of the more recent  but also now cancelled  iterations made daphne a goofball calI girl of sorts. and the sadly cancelled mystery incorporated added a lot of lore to each character  the best and most hilarious change making fred absolutely obsessed with booby traps that he was possibly beating his meat to them . I guess this long-ass comment is just me saying that  fixing  daphne isn t something new  but itsure is hilarious  and sad  when someone thinks that it is. she has two moms now  good for her I guess  I doubt they ll have anything to do with the plot . but I guess the fart-smelling types always gotta  fix  things with already-existing ips to make them reflect today s society because fetishizing people s identities for internet updoots can never go wrong!
this is what what happens when years of tumblr headcanon gets put into a writers room and given creative control.
I recently watched an episode of the old series last night  the one where they deal with the ghost of hyde  I think that was his name .  I recently bought the original series on dvd from an antique mall  lots of fun.  thats what the original cartoon was  fun  and so was everything that followed in its footsteps.this new one though...yeah  I wont even watch the trailer.  I definitely wont watch this show!!!
jinkies! daphne needs some clothes or at least a towel. she probably came out of the shower but still  xd
I love the personality of kelly from the office and now she s a part of this  why is she a part of this
cant believe fanfiction has gone mainstream
wait  wasn t daphne basically the level-headed  social expert of the group  not to mention I feel like I remember her being an adept lockpicker and an expert in fashion. you know  I wish we could have a rule that  to make a movie  you need to know about the lore of the franchise.
I dont mind a naked daphne. what I get upset about is that literally no one is like the original characters at all.
I wish they d just make new characters. Im part of the writing community on twitter and Ive seen some freaking amazing diverse characters  but in the creatively bankrupt hollywood  anything that takes actual passion and creativity is a no go. easy cash grabs or nothing
what about daphne in that awesome live action movie scooby doo 2 with michelle geller. daphne was a boss and smoking hot.
this is my first video I have seen of yours!! glad I found you!!
so  she goes from being from a well-to-do family with four sisters  to being a  foundling  picked up by a couple of cops.
ah yes  the diversed  self-aware  very smart and funny remake of my favourite series once again. incredible
question  what software and microphone do you use
they do these things to all characters that are curvy  smart and strong women itseems like for years now.
wait a sec they actually made saggy black so he s a black stoner and Im betting they couldn t afford to pay snoop dogg okay wow or key   peele or anyone that would actually wanted to voice a black stoner.but I already know they wanted to attach their names to this project.
gosh  I was just asking myself  you know what daphne s character was really missing to give her more depth gay parents  childhood trauma and closeted homosexual tension. now she s brave and stunning!
I swear the reason why this show is being made is because of discovery aka the cartoon killer
daphne wasn t just a pretty face. she was smart just in different ways than velma. she could macgyver herself out of all sorts of situations  something no one else could do except mystery inc fred. starting in the late 90s she was actually tough and knew some martial arts. they clearly dont understand her
oh yeah this s    s bombing tough!!. I dont think they understand or they re underestimating how much of a staple the original characters are and just about everyday life !!! hell matthew lillard became a meme about shaggy and having only 2  of his power to being a character using dragon ball z like powers on a video game!!! . everybody of all ages loved scooby-doo and still does the original characters because they re so diverse and personality already
shame that needs to be a rule  thought that would be common knowledge  how do you make a movie about a franchise without knowing anything about the franchise
3 32 zoinks! like  this is some dark shit  scoob! I ll be glad to sit this one out.
so  I take it brenda is a writer for this
scooby isn t in this because they couldn t race-swap him.
they made her smart and dependable in what s new scooby doo. have these people actually watched any scooby doo
yeah. Ive noted this with a lot of modern characters. for example in nutrek  no starfleet officer got into starfleet simply because they wanted to and it was a passion of theirs and they had  relatively normal lives growing up. they had to make them all fit for therapy  and that they had all of these issues and thus why they joined starfleet...they need to make their characters so overly complicated for no reason and call that character development.
the  shaggy  swap is the best and what every show that changes people should do. its a different character  norville  in the stoner spot.
bro! how could you insult daphne like that ! Im not saying every iteration of daphne is fantastic  but there is a lot of good iterations of her with a lot of great qualities. probably the best iteration of her all around would maybe be mystery incorporated. she s not at velma levels of intelligence  but she has really good problem solving skills and more street smarts and social skills than the others and she genuinely loves solving mysteries and stands up to her parents about her hobbies and her interests and her and fred have a nice relationship. maybe they moved a bit fast in their relationship  but it does have a bit of old generation high school sweethearts vibes and its still pretty cute. and other versions of daphne show these qualities  too. a lot of different daphne s know martial arts and can kick ass  probably after the first live action movie    in some movies she rides motorcycles and other vehicles  she has a lot of connections with family members and associates in towns they visit and handles a lot of the arrangements and planning side of the operations for all the traveling they do  usually handles the finances as well  and she kind of has an elle woods from legally blonde quality to her character. its very clear she s not just pretty  she s very intelligent and charismatic  too. and her beauty knowledge comes in handy  too  like in the second live action movie where she unlocks the thumb print scanner to a trap their stuck in by tricking the system with blush and a pore strip or in night of the vampire when she realizes the vampires tomb had been opened cause the vampire s clothes were made of newer  more recent fabrics and that they weren t their authentic robes. it kind of feels like maybe they only seen the original series and didn t look into any of the more recent adaptations  cause I will admit  the original daphne didn t have a lot of depth to her  but she was still likeable and appealing and it was a simple mystery show for younger kids with episodes that were 15 to 20 minutes long. most of the focus was on the actual mysteries  which works because thats the whole point of scooby doo and its basic plot structure! the mysteries and catching the villains every episode is literally the entire point of the show! and Im not saying you cant also have overarching plots with the main characters as well. mystery incorporated did and did it pretty well. but the overarching plots also fit with the tone of the show and doesnt seem like a tangled mess right out of the gate. I haven t seen this series and I probably wont  but the impression Im getting is that this particular series is targeted more towards a teen and young adult audience. which is perfectly fine  but the way they re doing it is giving me ptsd to the leaked power puff girls live-action script. itsounds like its just gonna be another riverdale! and trust me everyone has had enough riverdale and cw type shows! we dont need anymore! and they re trying to riverdale-ify a franchise thats normally targeted for a lot younger audiences  and while kids are smarter than we normally give them credit for  there is a limit and kids are gonna be turned off when they watch for simple scoody doo shenanigans and get hit with confusing teen drama backstories. kids aren t gonna care  and older audiences will probably just ignore it cause the creators make all these drastic changes to a show they grew up with to some capacity some time in their childhood  and instead of calmly explaining their changes and being respectful  they defensively trash talk the original series they loved growing up and try to say the audience is wrong for not liking the new show.  media companies in general  stop doing this every time someone disagrees with your creative decisions! it only makes things worse for you and opens yourself up for more criticism cause actual fans are gonna call you out on your bullshit takes and make you look dumb as hell.
its like they wanted to make such a unique scooby doo that they didn t even make scooby-doo  they just made a ip that insults the original and anything that came before it like its problematic.
I dont know what it is about the eraser of   bomb shell characters..    then proceeds to remove herself from view.
we gotta put an end to this tyranny
love how they always have to shit on the original to justify why theirs is  better . while I agree that daphne didn t have have that much to begin with  they would later it improve it in new iterations by having her be a girly girl fashionista who posseses a sharp wit and charisma  and a karate prodigy in some instances.  who uses her wealth and connections to help the gang out because she s of a high status. but alas  who cares about because we have to push our victim narrative.btw not a scooby doo so take my words with a grain of salt but fuck hollywood
Im so glad that they got rid of the old stereotype and replaced her with a new stereotype. lol!
so they are murdering daphne  and replacing her with a new character  but applying daphne s name
these  creators  clearly haven t actually watched scooby doo
actually  if what the snippet in that tweet about her being a freshman is true  then daphne would be 13-14 years old here  15 at the oldest.
that wht makes pe love scooby doo philosophy  they re different but they sticks together!
Imiss seeing fun in cartoons for kids.doesnt these cartoons make anyone else just feel depressed I rewatched some older cartoons like dexters laboratory and disney s recess and honestly had so much more fun compared to today s cartoons.this new stuff is just sad and I feel so bad for kids today
did the creators of the tomb raider reboot really pull the stuff the hbo max velma crew is pulling  I ll be honest  I never got a chance to play the original games since I never had a play station growing up  but I got the reboot games for pc and really liked them. I thought the story was really exciting and the characters neat. I still like the games today  though it makes me disappointed that the creators were mean to the fan base. do anyone have any links to any articles or interviews about the game s creators
I ll just stick with mystery incorporated a show that respects the source material but still put a fresh spin on the franchise
no scooby doo  but no scrapy doo either
norville is literally shaggys real name
yeah thats what often gets. if you want to make a different interpretation then just do it and shut up about the original being crap. thats like ea asking fifa team to make a new bf and bf team to make a new fifa - even though both series are successful you just need to hand them to people who say the originals are problematic a.k.a. crap.
oof
all you can do is show them the old stuff only  especially not to corrupt their innocence
spider-verse is an exception.
I still rewatch old scooby doo episodes along with the mystery inc show and ialways have a large smile on my face.
someone once said    feminism was created to give unattractive women access to mainstream society .  the more they try to erase   rewrite traditionally  attractive  characters  the more this statement seems to ring true.
you know  you look like a non-red hair daphne haha!
this is a masterclass in how not to make a show  and how not to promote said show. this will no doubt go down in flames immediately  santa inc. style.
mel mac! I gm d a gamestop for 2 years! you were my girl the whole time! keep doin what youre doin! love you!
even if all that daphne had going for her was her looks  which is not the case  what is wrong with having a  pretty girl  in a leading role  what about fred  hes a  pretty boy  in a leading role  are they going to change him
I remember that in scooby-doo! and the samuraI sword daphne is black belt
if anything  the new daphne is blander than the old one. I wasn t much of a fan of the older daphne but at least she brought something to the show  she was like the middle ground between fred and velma  where fred is a natural leader but impulsive daphne was level headed  acting as a foil to fred s impulsiveness and getting him to remain calm  and where velma is the genius who is aloof when it comes to street smarts social wits  daphne balances it out with her quick wits and social savviness. the new daphne on the other hand is just  inclusion . like they could have introduced a new character instead of just race-swapping preexisting ones but nooooooooo  go for the lazy route why dont cha and just   and your inclusive   and your inclusive   youre  white male anything the sjw hates at that moment  so you get kicked to the curb   and your inclusive .tbh this is why most people are gravitating away from regular television and are going down different avenues for entertainment  there s nothing innovative about new shows  its just a competition of who can collect the most woke brownie points.
lmao wtf daphne was dating fred Im so confused the only thing worse then disney is this why do they try to change the past
you can never please everyone but studios really need to embrace the bold strategy of trying to please as many as possible...
at the season finale shaggy will adopt scooby... and he ll be a pitbull.
forget everything you know about daphne... because no one at hbo watched the show nor could even be bothered to read a wiki
even dean winchester would kill them for doing that to her
the outcasts of society just keep getting more and more power.
be cool scooby doo has my favourite version of daphne
its like here we go again. love it when you add lara croft. they re going to make fred dumb and shaggy not the the fun goofy guy. what!!!!  no scooby-doo  they are completely ruining scooby-doo  Im mean not scooby-doo . this is one big face palm slap. they dont care about the fans. yup youre right  they will attack the fans when this booms. thank you melonie for the video. I didn t know all this. you look amazing. cant wait for the next video. take care melonie.
all of the characters weren t meant to have some huge backstory with tons of baggage. they were meant to have simple personalities that just meshed well for a very formulaic but lovable weekly show.they didn t  transform  this ip  they took the very superficial concept of  kids solving mysteries  and injected that into some woke diversity propaganda show  and then used the copyrights to tie it to an already existing audience.you cantell this because they spent less than 1 sentence tying daphne s back story to anything even remotely about mystery solving  while you can read what the rest has to do with lol
I dont get it why they make this decisions. ripley in alien is a strong and cool woman and suprisingly nobody complain.
honestly daphne is looks the weirdest after that change
I feel like none of the companies that make reboot wants to create a reboot that everyone would somewhat like  Im guessing they just have too much money and they needed to spend it on somewhere otherwise they pay more taxes.
God damnit I actually saw that post somewhere and didnt even notice daphne was total naked wtf hbo like I was so sure she was wearing something at least give her a towel come on
they gave fred  they them  pronouns and also he hasn t gone through puberty yet.
og daphne has more characters then what they could ever make
alright gang  here s the plan-   be quiet fred! we dont need a hwite man to tell us what to do! now someone come up with a plan!  but Ive got a-  ohmyGod fred! stop trying to oppress us!  Im not  you asked for a plan and i-  zoinks! like  stop speaking over minorities you white devil!  I expect this dialogue to be in there somewhere.
mystery inc. was the best version of scooby doo.
wait what  ! no scooby  what in the hell is going on ! this thing is ridiculous!
better to watch mystery incorporated  though only the pilot episode is out
canthis new daphne open doors with makeup and clothes  I dont think so
well  I guess they ll actually be able to pull off the impossible. I think they ll finally make a new scooby doo show thats completely ass  which is something everyone thought would ve been impossible lmao
I wonder how matthew lillard feels about the new shaggy
idc about velma and shaggy being race swapped but fred needs to be blonde  like that is a key trait you cant drop so its so far so good. but with daphne I think her being a red head and being defended from scottish nobility was a part of her character
no scooby doo in a scooby doo remake
Imean euphoria is based in highschool. there are drugs and sex throughout every single episode. idk how people dont feel uncomfortable with it.
I hate the hypocresy of taking a character and  fixing  it. if you dont like daphne thats ok. create another character  maybe she is more liked than daphne maybe she is not  but what they want is to project their self insertion fanfic using a stablished character fame has a plataform. in other word they want to  fix  something that worked replacing it with something they dont know if it works.
every time something like this is released I always get a good laugh when I see the audience score.
as a black man that didnt watch the original scooby doo im not necessarily the target audience nor interested in this but I think it would be cool if they did kind of a scooby doo multiverse I guess. they did crossovers before with supernatural and other franchises like justice league. above anything if the writing is bad then bad show but I think race swapping is the least of the shows problems. it might end up being a one season show or a multI season show but either way it is what it is
the thing I like daphne the most is thatshe knows to fight this new daphne is a big no no for me...this new show is a big no no for me
since when was romance the main focus of scooby doo
coming from someone who loves the original daphne out of everyone in the scooby gang  its just terrible how hollywood had to change her entire character in recent years  first in  scoob!  and now this  there s no need to change these classic characters like this into something they aren t  velma and daphne in this are not the same characters  leave these characters and shows alone if you cant be bothered to bring them back the right way
velma is shaped like mindy kaling  a box
have you heard of that new scooby-doo show...without scooby-doo
thats the modern way. instead to tell people  stay strong  or  get better  now we tell anyone that  it is okay to be not okay . but... thats doesn  lead anywhere.
they have come close before but this time they learned their lesson and were able to make it total ass.  the key was removing scooby doo.
notice they wait until the two original creators of daphne have passed away just a couple of years ago. we need to begin calling these new  re-invented  characters by their real name  in this case fraud daphne.
daphne and velma needed no updates.
not gonna lie  racist scooby in an adult cartoon version would be funny af  specially if everyone just hear dog barks while he is saying some of nastiest things imaginable.
the fact that they think wearing purple and being pretty are daphne s only characteristics are proof they dont know jack shit about scooby doo.
turn her in to an emotional basket-case...  hahaha  you are spot the fuck on
I think its always important to remember that this is corporate america s idea of what people want. thats why its so weird and seemingly out of nowhere. this isn t real to real people  just weird in general  so dont associate these decisions with people you meet in real life.
at this point they ll leave not one single pretty character for melonie to identify with  sexy people need representation too.
the got rid of scooby cause they couldn t race swap him lol
forget everything you know about-  instant journalism red flag
I really appreciate your opinions. this is a pretty damn good channel. you might like youngrippa59  similar opinions
if I had to be honest  probably the best version of daphne was the mystery incorporated version of her.
honestly I didn t dislike daphne at all but I would ve definitely  checked the bedrooms  with velma because you know the freak runs deep in the quiet ones  and then of course they go and make her lesbian because we cant have anything and everything hass to be changed
I cant wait for them to do a race swap for harry potter or the fresh prince of belair. black harry potter with a glock or white fresh prince with no money living in a cardboard box mansion. yup  its going to be fire.
hopefully hollywood doesnt try to remake the breakfast club lol they d change those characters too
in the spirit of yellowbeard  the pirate  hbo writers should have their feet nailed to the deck.
watch them add scooby doo and he s a cat.
she said they cant even woke right. I thought that was cute and funny
hbo used to be a great company. I loved boardwalk empire. not sure why they are messing up now.
I find tv and movie culture to be a chore to watch nowadays  I grew up watching over a thousand dvds of 1950s - mid 2000s television. I had my fun
Im pretty sure this show which is filled with one dimensional characters or maybe half dimensional because a lot of them just acted and made some jokes about it
yes  also she is great in zombie island. not to mention she became the leader in a few series
if you want to beat this just go buy consume the old stuff in numbers and avoid watching the new ones. once the numbers come in this stuff will go by the wayside and they will be forced to actually show effort and support for those communities by making original characters.
I love scooby doo. the best reimagined was pup named scooby doo
why canthey never seem to write their own stories  if they re so compelling and of the moment then why cant they stand on their own
I know I wont be watching any more of scooby-doo! Im glad Im on the downhill side of my life because I really dont like seeing how they keep ruining everything.
sad part is with the internet there are so many comic knowledgeably people that they cantap into and yet they dont care.
sounds like ppl irl are projecting their own insecurities onto daphne.
forget everything you know about x! then why didn t they make a new character
didn t they completely remove scooby from the show
thatscreen cap looks more like drawn together than scooby doo.  daphne really reminding of clara there.  and I guess velma s a combo of foxxy and toot.
the creator hates scooby doo. if she loved itshe wouldn t try to find what s wrong with well loved characters. these people only care about their agendas. thats why they dont understand what made these shows special
the only ppl I wanted to get the ip to scooby-doo is dead by day light.having the 4 humans as survivors. maybe some killer scooby-doo like rabid dog killer. or a unique dog survivor for scooby-doo. might be neat.
Imay be wrong here but I dont think they were high school age  at least not in the hanna barbera cartoon. I always thought they were supposed to be in their late teens  like college age. I cant remember now as its been so long since Ive watched an episode. they definitely sexualized velma in the 2002 movie. that is not the velma of the cartoon. in that movie  she was hotter than daphne  sarah michelle gellar  but this is just how it is with the entertainment industry. put simply  people enjoy watching attractive people.
after seeing what they did to fred it proves these people never watched the original series.
I hate when velma self-inserters demonize daphne and fred.
they seem to forget that daphne was the group badass and didn t need changing when we ve had daphne being a badass since forever lol
its all about their esg score  economic  social  and governance . everything nowadays is about esg. its like how the gas company puts out an ad making themselves appear so caring and responsible for putting a chemical in their product thatsmells like rotten eggs so you can detect a leak. they make themselves seem like such heroes when in fact they do it because its the law!the ad is to attract investors.
projecting their problems onto a fictional character to  fix  her screams woke.
these look like animated scooby-doo cosplayers
I am tired of them acting like older shows that were the pioneers of diversity had issues because they featured a variety of people of color and pretty diverse characters  not just in terms of race  but also including rockers  artists  real monsters  and even aliens. therefore  they never watched scooby doo in their lives. I have always enjoyed daphne.
the scooby gang hath been turned into the burger king kids club.
drawn together was actually funny
@james h u r l e y  yeah  but Im taking more about the art style.  daphne just really reminded me of clara in that image
I wouldn t mind if they made a series inspired by scooby doo. where instead of people dressing up as monsters to commit insurance scams or try to commit theft. they are now murderers that a group of friends have to investigate and capture. yet they have this.
ahh damn  childhood ruins. thank you to any bastard who creates that monstrosity
she was attractive but now she s diverse!   okaaaaay but why cant she be attractive and diverse   this isn t just shaming girls women traditionally deemed  attractive  by saying they cant be diverse  this is also shaming girls women of a more diverse background from being seen as  attractive  ..this is the opposite of inclusion
this has to be some kind of social experiment
two female police officers in a relationship those battles must be legendary
the real question is since when is dinkley a south asian name
sounds like this new daphne is troubled because she grew up in a fatherless home and is lacking the father figure she desperately yearns for that two moms cant provide.
a series that did diversity well is the rugrats series  as in the 1991 series.
I feel with lara croft it wasn t butchered nearly as bad as this. as someone who has been playing tr since the very first one was released in 1996 I felt the reboot and origin trilogy were really good. they weren t perfect but I loved all 3 and I never felt like it was constantly injected with woke nonsense. I agree looking back to the family trauma thing wasn t needed but it didn t impact the story of the games too much. I like the more rugged croft just because it fits into the story better than a croft who always looks perfect while hunting through tombs  I also think she is still super hot so yeah...this  however  is absurd.
next up  the flintstones reboot.
loool daphne in the original sd looks more buttoned down than velma. velma shows some skin!
daphne is a foundling  so she s a mandolrion
daphne was a rich valley girl who resented her parents for never being around and not living up to her 6 very crazy successful sisters...
plot twist! the writers are attempting to show how two women who raise a child end up failing where a mother and a father would not.
anytime a reboot says something along the lines of   forget everything you know about.......   Im out. the things that I  know  about the things I like are why I like those things.
but now some people are trying to ruin that by importing thatstuff to classic cartoon characters and even modern character yeah Im getting really sick of that too. I was finishing what you were going to saw at the end.
@9 50 ya gotta take out the part saying hbo max seriously @melonia mac go boomits gonna be hard to get the video monetize so long as thats still in there plus youtuck wont tell ya where the infection was but yes always use edit technics when sharing info form msm especially when its controversial cuz these wokesters tend to target all   any creators that have legit criticism towards their reimaginesthou Im sure you are aware of that much
thank you for calling this stuff out
they obviously didn t want to tell a scooby doo story. they wanted to tell a similar story that wasn t good enough to get made on its own merits  so they had to cash in on the love people have for these characters while taking little to nothing from the pre-established characters  other than their names.
5  is an adaptation anymore alteration. where is scooby
who the hell is norville   I know its shaggy s real name  but he s known as shaggy.  why change that    if that wasn t bad enough  they get rid of the character the show was named after.
Imean  technically they did fix her.  just in the veterinary sense of the word.
your hair is gorgeous btw
Im just waiting for these big hollywood companies to finally run out of money and be forced to change. I never give them my money anymore
melonie mac here just a little over a week ago was behind vara dark in subscribers and now she s 4 000 ahead of her. I think its because of her being with nerdrotic or is it geeks and gamers on some of their episodes with other guests. it really has given malonie a boost. Ive always wondered why vara dark is never seen with geeks and gamers  and nerdotic. she would fit in perfectly as a guest as does malonie here.
the og daphne had no character and was just there to be hot  unlike our version.   then we see daphne naked ...pick a lane and stay in the damn lane. dont flip-flop because it makes it look stupid.
this is too gentle please do a podcast with critical drinker to add violence
she alredy called fans of scooby and the gang racists they said  the only people that dont like this show are racists and hipocrits  like she wasent one herself
it is funny when you think about it  scooby-doo has always been diverse but that doesnt matter because they weren t gay or brown.
they didn t even try with shaggy...
I have an idea... how about   instead of us forgetting everything we know about characters  they could just create their own characters.
nooooooo!  I loved daphne the way she was!  I especially enjoyed seeing her being taken held captive all the time!   mmph!  mmph!   stupid cultural vandals!
hollywood is just staying true to their ideology. you cant play a character that doesnt match you in real life. that means mindy cant play as velma... unless you race swap velma. youre not a talking dog then you cant play scoob  so... no more scoob.
why are they doing this  this is a completelly new character  they could have new tv show or something.
what the af has happened to hbo ! I used to love their programming so much. subscription was a must! now you couldn t pay me to watch their shows. just awful.  longing for the days of sopranos  the wire  true detective  big love  game of thrones  six feet under  etc.
daphne played a huge role in all of the scooby doos... this makes no sense at all
cant wait for scooby-doo to be a golden retriever.
they should make scooby a pitbull.
logically   why dont they create new shows and characters instead of rehashing and changing what s been done already  thatshould be obvious  isn t it the truth is  because nobody would feel drawn to it and no one would care to watch it .so then  what would be the conclusion
frankly  they are putting together a show that isn t worth watching and will be unmatched.
you have to understand melonie had a big following before making this channel. a lot of her former following are still finding out about this channel and are pumping in here.
@c j  where is she known from
@grzegorz mj  https   youtube.com c meloniemac from here
honestly its more the youtube algorithm suddenly promoting this channel more.
@alexia hoardwing  plus I think that it could be that vara dark is more edgy and up front in how she expresses herself.
@grosbeak  thing is I had youtube recommend both recently and subscribed  even though I have watched nerdotic and g g  for  a long time now.
they fixed nothing. best adaptation was the scooby-doo with sarah michelle as daphne
they use the name because they know itsells   they cant make an original conceptto save their lives
they literally gave daphne yellow skin and slanted eyes.
they should  fix  the  fat albert and the cosby kids  and remake it with all non-poc kids. even though I am a white redhead  I never even thought about the black or white issue when I was a kid watching this series. I watched it because I liked the characters and it made me laugh.
they put this daphne atop a pedestal as a strong  complex and realistic female character  yet they shamelessly sexualize her like she s from a cringy ecchI anime.  and I bet many of these shows have better written female characters  even if wildly sexualized
did somebody say scooby scooby woke
1 58  our daphne is diverse  if the very first word you use to describe your character is  diverse  I already know the character sucks.  diverse  is a word that tells a lot about the author and exactly the type of character they write. it is like people that unironically use the word  proletariat   from that word alone you already can deduce a lot about the person.
I always thought that velma was japanese
they know this show is gonna bomb hard. they went the fanbait route.
if you want to insult the scooby doo where are you daphne the worst thing you can say is thatshe was a plot device because without her capture you never find the bad guys layer to get the clues to lead you to the driving down of the property value to be purchased up by said ghost
just do new generation of mystery inc for new generation of viewers with old crew being their mentors and providing additional help or something
didn t mystery inc go over her back story
why cant we have more stuff like scooby-doo and guess who instead of this  either that or  a pup named scooby-doo  scooby dooby doo  scooby-doo  scooby-doo where are you  scooby-doo . God I love thatshow. everybody sing it.  there s a mystery in town  call the coolest pup around  its scooby  a pup named scooby-doo
fixing daphne means making her capable.  nothing to do wit her looks.
they should call it   scooby-doo woooooooooooke
I am so confused  if the character of velma is actually writing that text email about the  judy jetson  show then the main character of this woke show  is actually just the exact type of person they are making fun of  so attack the fans  and then have your already completely different main character be the exact thing you hate  I dont get it. and if she is just like that for the teaser to bash people that happen to actually enjoy this ip  then what is actually the point of this show
as an asian Ive never seen a character race swapped as an asian before and now that its here as expected I dont like it and daphne is my favourite character but for reason I felt more distant with her in this potrayal
all this revising these people are doing are the biggest cases of projection Ive ever seen in my life. just projecting all their insecurities and perspectives onto everyone else. they dont bother polling people to check or anything  they just revise revise revise  I believe daphne was nothing but an object  therefore you must believe that too and go along with all of my delusions  projections and beliefs because I say so and because the current culture and period of revision we live in reinforces that for me! anyway  its time to write off anything in the sphere of visual entertainment  its pretty much all garbage.
y all have a badass day
og daphne has no character  what a bold statement  I guess they never watch the og s or the other literation of scooby-doo  she is smart but not bookworm type like velma  she is charismatic and bold sometime  actually she is the one who take care of the gangother than that  she has quick wits and lots of usefull and handy skills like lock picking  wide arrange of knowledge  diplomatic skill  etc thatsometime help the gang or even save the day  thats why in zombie island she become a reporter
I was looking to see if anyone else noticed posted about this. its... so bad...
fan baiting is a tactical nuke  not a red flag.
daphne was the pretty girl that was good at everything and rich.
did they ever watch what s new scooby doo  daphne was straight up a female macguyver in thatseries. that alone goes against what they said.
there s three different tomb raider series  the original series  tomb raider anniversary second series   first reboot  tomb raider uncharted clone third series second reboot. I agree lara croft is the first two series is lara croft at her best.
I never sexualized when I was watching scooby-doo shows  I just liked the comedy and the plot. she was never to be eye candy  thats an opinion and she s no longer wealthy and her parents are cops !
this is what happens when you force woke-ness down peoples throats  now they have to answer to the mess they started.I grew up watching the og scooby doo and I never once thought of race in the characters  only that we had a frat boy  rich hottie  a stoner and his big funny dog and the nerd girl  and I am of a mix race.people today just needs a sense of history when it comes to reviving old shows. this  diversifying  something that works and was never a problem to begin with is out of control and simply cringe imo.oh and how is it a scooby doo without the title character  that makes zero sense. why not just make a whole new show with all they ve changed  sorry hbo but this is a sure way to not win people back over to your channel. hbo is trash lately.
scooby will probably be a cat.
so its been a while I dont remember every character trait the cast of scooby-doo had but I know its way more then hot and purple  especially in the movies . it really shows the disrespect towards what came before I really wish they just called itsomething else but we know why they hijacked scooby-doo and the gang cause there project would fail without the name recognition.
I think it looks absolutely terrible. God bless you and your family. duane.
the ministry of truth is in full swing.
they probably kept fred white so they can make shaggy bI and they can get their tumblr fanfic dream on tv lmao
everyone and his brother knew  even as a child  that daphne and freddie were a couple.what s wrong with that
original problematic  how dare they  they are calling our childhood problematic. yikes
daphne was my favorite character  she was pretty much the leader. she took care of everyone and was the one to figure everything out.also  love the shirt.
scooby doo debuted in 1969  I was a kdI in the 90 s watching reruns...the concept of  updating  is not needed and never speaks to updated quality
we want to be inclusive but also exclude attractive people because it makes us feel insecure about ourselves.
wouldn t be an hbo show without a depiction of naked high schoolers
I dont know  once they started making catwoman black in the 2010 s  they kept it that way. lego batman  harley quinn  the new batman movie  I cant remember other examples I had  dont think white catwoman exists anymore. yes I know they made her black at some point in the 60 s  though thatshould have just been a new catwoman  not selena kyle  race swapping mid-series is just... . point is  black catwoman seems to be the new permanent.
is nothing sacred anymore  powerpuff girls having an abusive professor and now scooby doo with no scooby doo
remember that one movie thatshowed how in touch she was with her scottish roots.
really great to see women speaking up. necessary.
@andrenitro x1000  thats interesting my memory isn t great but even in the cartoon live action movies she was more then just a pretty face. all of them were architects but unique in the first cartoon movie  I think it was the first one was zombie island  . after going there separate ways shaggy worked for airport security with scooby  and they  were quite successful and they were good at finding things   velma owned a bookstore  I want to say she also wrote horror books but not sure been to long    and fred who in the movie he was dating daphne and was helpings her and supporting her from behind the scenes. I dont want to assume malice where incompetence is more likely but it just feel deliberate at this point.
@blackdragoonv7  your right. also zombie island was the first scooby doo movie thatsuccessfully updated the characters without  destroying their likeable nature.
if they removed scooby race swap characters why dont they just create a new series  oh right  its creative bankrupt hollywood.
and scoby-doo now is a chihuahua
I think tomb raider had at least some of the original game devs that made the first games work on it  and the square grid outlay of the original could not be remade  and replaying the original you get attacked by dinosaurs and freeky exploding aliens or flash zombies  yeah some parts of tomb raider were crazy and honestly if remade the exact same way.... I dont think it would have done well. I think the remade games are great  I prefer them to the grid design challenge of the original romp. the new movie was not necessary and idk why that was made I think maybe that is what youreference  older movie with angelina jolie  vs new one with a  forgettable cast  and plot   itsaying the original movies were great but they definitely had a bigger impact. as for scooby getting ruined... I agree 100  with you!!!
they didn t put scooby in a scooby-doo spin off my mans how do you mess up that basic shit
I appreciate that you often compare with what happened to lara. to me  itseems like it all started with her. and I was never able to like the new one...
clearly these guys know their stuff! daphne was too pretty  velma was too straight  shaggy was too white and fred  who cares about fred really  and let s get rid of the dog he adds nothing to the group this is scooby doo !
Ive never enjoyed scooby doo in the first place  but the lack of understanding on the property or self-awareness on display with this show is incredible to me.mindy kaling   I really identify with velma s character  but Im indian  so it would help me actually identify with her character if we could make her be me. just make her a self-insert of me. thank you. also  velma will be gay  so we ll need to ruin another character as an extension of that. daphne works. then  for bonus points  they go after shaggy. even people who dont like the series tend to like shaggy exactly the way he is. since they re going for a complete wokeness homerun here  is scooby a chihuahua now
they fixing stuff that ain t broken. it is the definition of a bad idea.
I did think it was funny that they act like they re being progressive by making them different races  but they just played into stereotypes  the smart one being made indian and the one who s high all the time being made black.
thats funny. wow!
Im asian. daphne should be a white redhead. she didn t need fixing.
I really hate the idea of shaggy being black  Im black  because its looks like a very vapid way to try to create interest in the show. the race swap thing just not a story-teller by itself  so idk why people are thinking it makes their show interesting.. it doesnt. especially when its a character that already has an established backstory. just make your original characters whatever race you want them to be  whatever story you want them to have  but to take a character that is already established and tried to box them into the narrative that youre trying to tell is just getting really tiresome and in a way lazy to me.literally  the more I learn about this show the -ier it looks.
the sad truth is that daphne s soft femininity is only a  problem  because she is a woman. fred and shaggy would be celebrated if they were to dress  act  identify  and present in the exact same manner and style.
but now scooby is gender neutral but identifies as a cat.
I d rather forget you and your entire woke existence and culture and those that follow than forgetting everything about daphnie or any of my favorite characters because you want me to.
fans   why you changing and ruining scooby doo  hbo   reasons  why wont you subscribe to hbo max  fans   reasons
velma s body shape is because thats mindy kaling s body shape. velma is literally just a self insert of kaling.this is probably another case where an kaling came along with an idea for an original show and studio executives decided it had to be tied to an existing property.
Im hoping this is just a spinoff alternative universe  if itsticks to that its fine. itseems like its more for adults then kids
thats why they could portray a tribe like the dahomey tribe  as a tribe that opposed slavery where the true story is the complete opposite.
the creators insulting daphnedr.evil and thats  how you like to live your life  is it
what even happened with lara  I dont get it. whats the problem with lara croft we have now  lara croft in the new trilogy is just the younger version before tomb raider 1. that was it.
@metal videos    no she s not. she s not even a pale comparaison of what she used to be. plus  we already had the beginning of her story. she s just lame now.
common company mandate  why risk money on an unknown ip that might not have marketing power  when you could use a familiar ip that people already know the name of subconsciously.look at the first sonic movie or any ubisoft game nowadays. the sonic movie was just a generic duo travel movie  emperor s new groove  blues brothers  midnight run  dumb   dumber  etc.  with peppering of the sonic ip in.go to any ubisoft game and its exactly like every ubisoft game that released for the past couple of years in one way of another.
@alexia hoardwing  following a formula is one thing. sonic doesnt exactly have a mountain of consistent lore from game to game  so they had to come up with something that would work with their blended actor   cg approach. I would have been fine with complete cg animated set on the original world  but thats beside the point.ubisoft is formulaic  but not remotely what Im referring to nor the connection youre trying to make. if ubisoft were to make a first person shooter  but slap  assassin s creed  on it  thats leveraging an existing ip for something new.what s continuously confounding to me is this approach of1. taking a new ip idea2. jam it into an existing ip it doesnt fit3. think thats going to be a success with the built in fan baseif youre using a recognizable ip  a marketing approach of completely alienating said ip s long standing fan base seems counter intuitive  and has consistently failed countless times already.why immediately scorch the baked in audience  particularly in an era of nostalgia  where hooking the now adult fans means they bring their kids to experience the thing they grew up with.  I loved this thing  I want my child to experience the thing too  is a powerful marketing tool  but  I loved this thing and they ve butchered it beyond recognition  so let me get my child the original thing  doesnt seem like a good strategy for profits.its wildly confusing to me.
they ve never tried to say this was replacing the original series. I dont understand why people are acting like this show means they re dropping production on every form of scooby doo media. they re still releasing movies every damn year  there s even been talking about another season for mystery inc.
hell what s new scooby-doo  mystery incorporated  and even all of the movies  both live action and animated  did a better job at fleshing out the gangs personality. so that excuse doesnt work.
.yeah .zaslav s going to axe this sooner rather than later.
I heard a rumor that mindy kaling wanted to make an original show about teens solving mysteries  but the executives wouldn t greenlight it unless it was attached to an established ip. is there any truth to this rumor
velma and shaggy being race swapped like that pisses me more than daphne thats not shaggywhats next  make scoob a poodle
wow I never realized how the scooby doo gang are all typical highschool stereotypes that work together despite their differences  the new velma show sounds so cynical of the source material its ugly
scooby doo just got pooped on by the left.
they were all fixed....... they probably will make fred weak and everyone will make fun of him......... at least dapne still has red hair......
they must really hate melonie mac then  3.
karens being insecure because a fictional character looks better than them so they gotta  fix  them.
I said kinda the same thing on another comment  I just thought the greater comment section would like my thoughts.I honestly love daphne s character so much  because of this reason! she s knowledgable  kind  and is great at figuring out peoples intentions. Im like also 90  sure she knows some sort of martial art  if not she s great at fighting never the less. she has taking on demons and ghosts! she also drives motorcycles extremely well! she is so underrated in the stuff she does  I love thatshe could totally be like a vigilante and no one would bat an eye. she s so fun! it really sucks that they erased all the parts of her that were of substance  she really is great.this is more an artistic nitpick but daphne really doesnt look right  like I know what east asian people look like. and her eyes are too pointy  it makes her look like she s wearing a mask  and not her actual face. it really feels not quite right. if they rounded the pointy bits a bit no problem  but she really sticks out as her art-style is drastically different from the rest of the cast.also calling the town they live in poor town    like what   they could have totes called it crystal cove like the other scooby doo show  but I guess they went the make fun of poor people route   like huh  oh and the sexualisation! of the teen characters!!!! its really fucking weird they usually make the teen characters they sexualise 18-19 and sometimes 17 going on 18  but I really do think they are going to be like 16-17 years old in this show. which really freaks me out  since Im that old! friggen perv s..hope you all have a swell day! good morrow!
now  in and of itself  a character with a mysterious past is not a bad thing  per se  see wolverine for example  however this trope can be beaten to death  this is what we are seeing with lara croft and now daphne blake. oh  and one other thing  if they wanted an asian  daphne   they could ve named her something else. Im not going to tackle the shit pile that is shaggy.
a student named brenda is not the only one missing a brain
daphne is pretty  have common sense  fashionist  dont show skin like a of  model   femenine  likes to eat right and exercise so she loves being in shape  she is a redhead  of course they would go after her
worrying about the age of consent for cartoons.... hI karen!!
u are my new favorite video to watch every day. ...keep up the great work
there s a reason why they re bending these characters  if they created original characters like this  no one would watch it!
could easily have given her some kind of past that lends to abandonment issues  which leans into her  damsel in distress  trope  and how she could struggle against something when she gets separated from the group. coulda done all of this without writing a hit piece on the original character  given her a little depth. if they took the age old adage of show dont tell  and didn t spew this gross rhetoric  people wouldn t even be upset. the race thing is completely for marketing as we know by now  and its just absurd. these people dont know how to write  let alone rewrite.
nice work
imagine gaining control of a beloved ip just to get rid of the main character  pick your favorite supporting character and insert yourself as that character.mindy out here tryna take amy schumers crown for most hated female  comedian .
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.
aw shucks
@melonie mac go boom
the best thing is there is an easy button to all this. just dont tune in. I see all this disruption about horrible stuff hollywood is putting out popping up on youtube but I dont watch it. she halk  didn t watch rings of whatever didn t watch hellraiser well that one I wanted to watch and did and it was ok. simple as.hollywood being bad isn t anything new just this whole  woke  thing is both a big copout and tool for them. they love that they are getting more people s attention. scooby doo was corny in 2000s and 90s before it only the original was great. so its not surprising.love from japan!
honestly I looove scooby-doo and daphne is one of the longest members of the scooby gang and even led the team during two different series!! she s a smart and badass investigator who is a black belt and always there for her friends!!! I love velma but do not ruin both their characters for some lame series that will never gain true fans and be a waste of money to create
its like they dont even read the history of these characters and just assume they were written by sexist or some shit
I dont fully understand everything about  woke  and personally hate the term... but this new spin-off  can youreally call it a spin-off when the characters are so drastically altered that its only related by name   is literally like if  woke  was a form of nuclear liquid all the characters fell into that mutated them and this was the result.
at the 8 50 mark there is a tweet at the bottom that has me crying
Im guessing if they ever remake captain caveman  the teen angels will be the trans teen angels.
you wanna change velma and daphne  ok whatever but canthey atleast explain how drawing pictures of nude highschoolers isn t pedophilia ..like someone literally had to sit im the office thinking of a highschool daphne and start drawing her then somewhere in their screwed up brain they star5 imagining her naked in a shower and commence to drawing it and then someone else had to come through look over all these pictures and greenlight it..who was that too ...I think that needs an explanation
look at the state of the people they are pandering to. there s your answer...
I just think of this crap as one-shot elseworlds that bombs and never sees again  but only triggers more and more all-new all-different reboots until they end up going back to the original.  why daphne has red hair ... wut
producers  just make your own ip that ticks all of your boxes.  yeah  there s a strategy in riding coattails. if you cant work outside the box  youre in the wrong box.
1. in the scooby-doo I watched daphne was never  just eye candy  she always had some idea  or special skill that helped the group...velma was obviously the brains but daphne was far from just a pretty face.2. if you want a show about a smart asian girl solving mysteries  just make an original show about a smart asian girl solving mysteries.3. its a fckn scooby-doo show with no scooby-doo!!!
race swapping  in itself  is just stupid because it neither adds or detracts anything from the narrative unless the focus of the narrative is the race of the character. so what does it do to make velma black or whatever background without the regional and cultural factors taking hold of the character  whenever there is a decision to do something in story telling and make it known  itshould effect every part of the story or its lazy. so they will have to do the work to answer why shaggy is black  why velma is black and why daphne is now asian. if its not answered then they would have done it for no reason and whatever writing they chose to conspire this story with is starting from a place of bad ethics.  they re just treating the audience as fools. this isn t a new thing  its what you ve seen before but with even less ethical writing.  never treat the audience as stupid  even children.
honestly they should just make a new type of tv show not apart of scooby do franchise
was just there to be hot  the very first image we ever saw of her was that exact one shown over a year ago and she was fully nude. what is wb smoking   same with disney
1 59   I hate this modern trend of referring to a single person as  diverse   a word that by definition  refers to a group  to mean that person is a minority. one person cant be  diverse .and if you think what they re doing to daphne is bad. read the profile they wrote up for their fred. they are openly admitting they are going to make him an arrogant  dimwitted  white  male dude bro who s going to sh t all over his teammates  which is part of the reason they race-swapped everyone else  but kept him white.
its a shame that nowadays these people are more activists than writers  they use classic characters and franchises that people love  to express their political view instead of tell a good story  and they force diversity to draw attention away from bad writing and bad characterization  they just talk about this  not the plot  or characters  traits and motivations.just create a new ip and use diversity on it. but if they were going to create a new franchise  to draw people s attention itshould have to be good  with good writing and good characters  so it is easier for them to use an established franchise  and mock fans who dont agree with their bulshit.
I liked sarah michelle gellar as daphne.
is this a kids show or not anymore  cant say I remember there being corpses and open head gore with brains missing in the og.
aauummm... eeemmm  fred is not a jock. he is just a guy who like runs the school newspaper. he was not a tough guy at all. daphne was always self conscientious about everything. she had problems making decisions. that what her thing. she lacked confidence. an was working on it. shaggy was a pacifist who hated to resort to violence. he preferred to take it easy at all times. because if he ever became aggressive he would loose control. velma was just shaggies friend. an she was very smart. that was it. but everyone trust her to put together clues.
I often wonder why they keep changing establish characters instead creating new diverse one.... and then I understand that thay have no idea how to make anything interesting and any  woke  show that is made is fliooping  so they have only the option to steal other works and say  there we fixed it  by destroying it
its weird how these people are simultaneously deviantly hyper sexual  while also being so prudish they re almost victorian. everything they do and say is cognitively dissonant.
@andrenitro x1000
it took everything in me not to bust out laughing from the memes while recording this
woke character development is basically writing about your own insecurities and mental issues
they know there will be dissent and backlash and decide the message is more important than sales. nothing to see there.
made a couple of jokes about the show and how a lot of things are problematic because of stereotypes and what not. a friend I hadn t heard from for years threw the whole  the original still exists just watch that  things shouldn t always stay the same.  and I was just so frustrated because no things cant stay the same  but that doesnt mean taking the name of something popular and using it to sell a show that probably got denied until it had the popular name to it. just make new stuff  with new characters and leave the old things how they are  cause guess what people like how it was.
maybe scoob will be a pit bull
my spouse is a huge scooby-doo fan. this velma show is not going over well in our household. non-white household  by the way.
well this is the first heard of this hbo max scooby-doo and itsounds like something that Im not going to bother to watch
the only thing in scooby-doo that required fixing was scrappyn the least favorite character.
more importantly  why is there a guy with half his skull and his brain missing  I dont think would have been in any scooby doo. its supposed to be all fake.
to me whats even more offensive than the woke shit  is the self inserts. completely getting rid off old characters and ruining it for everyone else to fill their own egos.
how come that episode sounded like it came from buffy the vampire slayer
I cant believe you uploaded this during the steelers game! Im trying to watch both now
the only scooby doo my kid watches are the original episodes. the only actually great ones
maybe the developers writers are projecting their insecurities  emotions and feelings of inadequacies on these characters. sorry they had such miserable teen years that they feel the need to screw it up for everyone else. the characters look horrible at best  what a crock of crap. nice job mel.
velma is 15 ! what!
well all the voice actors are of the same ethnicity so Im sure there was some creative decision  from the producers  higher up suits or casting  to model the new characters after the voice actors ethnicity because God forbid an actor is forced to actually act these days rather than represent a fictional version of themselves. its so dumb. I cant wait to go to my local sushI restaurant later and demand they get the mexican person making my cut rolls out of the kitchen because their skin color doesnt reflect their work.
well if they want to complain about people voicing animated characters when they arent of the race nationality presented.. then I suppose they would have to race swap to do this for themselves.  we just want new stories and ip   not for them to reboot old products over and over.
the show failsthe writers   and we would have gotten away with it too if it weren t for those hateful bigots!
Imay not agree with the art style changes but the scooby gang has always stayed the same characters they ve always been. who thought doing that was a good idea  0 0
wdym  this is very creative and brave! instead of turning a red head black they turned her asian! give kaling a trophy! however  I now rescind said trophy because of the great offense committed here  daphne wanting to know her past. is kaling implying there is something wrong with two women adopting a child  thatsaid child will still feel incomplete without knowing where she came from  the nerve.
ok... I get it.. sorry for spamming your channel but there is a purpose to this. there is a purpose to making this cartoon in this way. what they are doing is taking a beloved and cherished childhood memory and trashing it. they are demonstrating their control and power. not only canthey do this to these characters from our past they can do it to our kids. they can do it to anyone. this is monstrous.
but to be fair mindy khaling does have a convincing velma voice
you know  all these changes feel like they could make a pretty awesome show.if only they didn t butcher and twist an already existing one because they dont care about its original audience anymore.too bad  its guaranteed to fail now. so much for empowerment.
forget everything you know about good media- modern day hollywood
my headcanon is shaggy is a vietnam vet with ptsd with his service dog scooby who needs to get high all the time to deal with it  and he hates conflict cuz ptsd and war.
hbo   crap  there is already a black shaggy...Ive got it. norville  that is the perfect black stoner name... win!!!
didn t dafne use her make-up kit to unlock a finger print lock in the second film  she did. Ive seen her doing more than just being a damsel in distress. but I haven t watched scooby doo - the original  not this current trash - in ages.
they never learn
ah yes. they made velma a black lesbian  and daphne the stereotype thatshe never was.I remember watching the various series over the years  and daphne always had some skill or trick up her sleeve that none of the rest of the gang did. I remember she turned dental floss into climbing cord  and knew which way hawaiI s primary wind direction was to find north in mid day or some other bear grills type shit.
dappy doo was not in the orignal scooby doo
these people dont operate in the real world
they should ve just made a new show with new characters if they was going to change every single thing about it to piss off fans. seems like thats the point.
by saying there was no character to begin with isn t only a insult to the character but thats also kind of a punch in the face to the original creators if you think about it what they had in the old cartoons was enough and thats said for all the characters   and its interesting that they always give these  better versions  trauma or a race change or make them lgbtq   and the fact they are changing everything and removing the character the show was named after is actually insane this just seems like a desperate cash grab gone wrong. I dont know what the hell they were thinking when they changed the designs of classic characters and such loved ones at that  and not the mention they are sexualizing the characters  and the fact they are also mocking the fans is a bad move on their part. I would of loved a mature scooby doo but this isn t even scooby doo anymore its just some sad adult fanfic at this point. and to be clear not every character needs to be relatable why cant we have are wacky and fun characters from time to time cartoons are supposed to be a somewhat escape from that a time unwind and destress and have a few laughs what happen to the shows I know and love.
mindy is a 4 and is taking it out on daphne
what s both depressing and aggravating is that the wokers demand changes to a show that they wont watch and the end result will be that they ll drive away the fans who ve been watching. their ratings will sink quicker than the titanic and wb will blame the fans for changing something that didn t need to be changed in the first place. Im a middle of the road in politics but enough of this bs. ffs  dont change the characters. just add a couple of new ones.
I think velma had become a bit more to sexy in recent scooby-doo cartoon even her could get the hot guy to flirt with her  .  the woke mob dont like it when young men look at women with envy
here s how you make the perfect movie according to an sjw place a set of cardboard boxes on the ground  record vo of people declaring pronouns and orientations  then burn an image of anything that was popular before the year 2000.
the attempted own of the fans through that velma letter about judy jetson was laughable. just shows they know they are guilty and what they are doing is wrong. it used to be that people would defend woke bs by saying the creators dont know any better or that they mean well. its ignorance  its well intentioned! no. its malevolence. and even when they feel guilty  they still do it. so fuck them. hold them accountable. destroy them.
lets hope that it ends with season 1 and on a cliffhanger.another show I wont watch.btw isn t mindy one of writers of the office
the same people are making the new malcom x starting ryan gosling!
if fred is father in group  daphne is mother  velma is nerdy aunty and shaggy is baby while scooby is dog. they are like family. if you destroy that   you destroy soul of scooby foo. woke content is just too depressing and not worth of anyone s time.
if it wasn t for the hotd and got... I dont think we would even have hbo... hell  most shows you can get around paying for anyways.
actually makes perfect sense
that is a pretty epic headcanon
thats deep man  I dig it
well instead of mindy maybe key   peele should have directed this and wrote it they could have done shagging and scooby as black characters that would actually been funny if we re joking about hbo s butcher job they did on a classic showbut damn why cant they just leave velma dinkley alone she was a nice girl with a normal body classic figure she wasn t skinny she was fine how she was they body shame velmamaybe instead of scooby being a bloodhound he ll be a big white poodle Im kidding of course and Im definitely not watching hbo max to watch this its not worth the money for a scription for shows that they are ruiningIm done
norville is shaggy s actual canonical name.
@paige arnold  humor  didn t get that I was making a joke
@ed v8 zr1  oh sorry  thats my bad.
that would imply that they have the ability to create.
the daphne design is literally a copy and paste of poison ivy from the harley quinn animated show
when it tanks  we will all be labeled a bunch of  ists  and  phobics . when has their woke taint ever worked  disney tries...tanks.netflix tries...tanks.hollywood tries ...tanks.comics....... again tanks.yet  somehow its everyone elses fault it tanks. the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again  expecting a different result.
making every character you can fat  gay  trans  black or whatever is not the solution  but since thats the road we re headed down Im looking forward to asian sanford and son and seeing tom hanks play martin luther king.
if I have double standards  that means I have twice as many standards as you and am thus a better person.
its funny how its a problem for shaggy to be a white stoner  while making a race swap and possibly making him the same stoner.just wait to here the people complain.
not a fan of this person tbh but I remember this one person who said  everything that turns woke turns to sh t .
8 10 actually  velma is apparently indian now  because thats the race of her voice actor. all of the voice actors are the same race as the characters in this show  because we all know that it would be  problematic  and  racist  for non-white actors to voice a bunch of white characters... or was it the other way around  hmmmm...
so tired of this crap  first my favorite video game character  then my favorite disney princess  and now beloved scooby doo  this is the second time they fucked up with the scooby doo franchise.now  Im afraid buffy may suffer then same fate  just as charmed did awhile ago.
physically attractive people have a right to exist!
any one wanna bet that they will have a scooby  but he s a furry
where I disagree is that the tomb raider games before the reboot were so convoluted that they had to make a change  so I get why they rebooted it. but this does look unnecessary.
you d think if they kept shitting on things the flies would become unbearable after a while..
what s the point of this representation bullshit...so if I was indian  I d only have to care for velma  because she looks like me. screw other characters  because I dont see myself in them
so they want a racially diverse team of bI sexual detectives who are in a love rectangle dont know any talking dogs  dont drive a van called the mystery machine  solve violent murder mysteries that dont include the murder dressing up as a local scary legend  but they want the gang from scooby doo  thats like saying they want a show about doctors from every country  only one of them is american  who live in a modern city and wanting no  army or helicopters in the show  but wanting the show to be mash. with this manny changes and personality redesigns they have no business calling it velma or anything scooby doo related
they dont want any conventionally attractive characters because they themselves are usually not conventionally attractive and therefore dont see  at the very least  utility of it.beauty has toppled empires and inspired new ones to rise. kinda poetic imoalso  why are they all gay now  suddenly everyone s gay wtf lmao
the problem is that we need fans at the top  and  the top  doesnt care about the product or fans  and fans do care  ergo fans wont be allowed to get to the top to help the products....
what bugs me about shaggy ain t even he s black. its his design looks so damn lazy. nothing about it connects with the original character  it just looks like a college bro who had to put together a last minute halloween costume for the party. so found some old khakI pants and a musty green shirt and called it a day. meanwhile artists online have made way better reimaginings of the design  and actually can see shaggy in it.
rings of power the original books and content that came before was problematic too!
black shaggy! ! !  loool wait isnt itstereotypical to make the black character be a stonerwhat is happening
when you take an established character and change them  then its no longer that character. why not just make something new and original  oh  then you wouldn t have the instant popularity already garnered by the work of previous artists that actually created these characters. lol
they made the nerd indian  the stoner black  the karate athletic girl asian.
@c j  this is beyond satire at this point
I heard that they kept fred white because his character is going to be stupid and the type of person who tries to take credit for everything.
@lark88  I cantotally see this happening
@lark88  fred might be working with the villains by the end lol.
I d rather see the more mature scooby series called mystery incorporated here on youtube than watch this messed idea of a show.
is this a family guy skit  I feel like Im living in a family guy skit...
silly me  when I heard they were making the show about velma and racebent her to be southeast asian  I assumed that meant she would be with a whole new cast of characters. how naive I was. the most offensive thing about this reveal was that they made shaggy  the hippie pot smoking-looking dude ghetto black.I dont have time to lend to people who are driven by spite and fueled by ignorance.
wtf I thought it was a meme when I heard about this. they re really doubling down on the bs
wow just wow.  they made shaggy...a literal black guy with dreads.  wokewood stereotype much  this is how wokewood think of blacks.
the vast majority of people throughout history were raised by a mother and father. let s be sure to get as far from that ideal as possible. everyone needs to be as effed up as the modern writer.
what would happen to the social world if hbo decided to remake fat albert with a white skinny guy  a russian girl in there  and a vietnamese mushmouth
subjugation or an attempt at it anyway.. we ve been doing this for thousands of years like with the roman empire grafting  all saints day  over the celtic holiday we came to know as halloween
if they have a problem with the characters  . why not create a brand new show with brand new characters instead of ruining it for the og fanbase. Im only 23 but a lot of my childhood favorites have been ruined by being remade reimagined gotta love left wing media. tomb raider  daffney  power puff girls  etc
let s remake the a-team with tom hanks as mr t
I hate how petty spiteful people have taken up positions of leadership and put their toxic ideologies in beloved childhood animations.
Im going to assume fred is an absolute jon arbuckle and will be the comedy relief while velma takes the lead. norville  totally not shaggy  will be our token black guy because why not  and scooby  who the fuck is scooby  I heard he does not exist at all in this thing.the mystery machine will probably be some eco friendly electric clown car.
iam sticking with the original  scooby-doo  hbo  can have this reboot.
forget watching any of the new scooby doo projects.  I was always more of velma man myself. I always thought mindy kaling was the hottest woman on the office. yet I would only watch this if you paid me double my usual wage..
that judy jetson rant just reeks of fan baiting
it is too bad they spent the so much time trying to convince everyone it is a good thing to change a well established character to a very different race or acting a specific sexual orientation. they would probably be more successful just creating something completely new instead. unfortunately  no one in the entertainment industry aeems to be creative enough for that.
funny  the ones  fixing  the pretty  nice girl characters  are ugly  bitter and combative trolls. jealousy seems to be the prime motivator.
this will bomb
the part where they tried saying nothing about velma is defined by her  whiteness   jinkies usually comes to mind. imagine taking boondocks and recasting them with other races other than black. rufus would be much more racist than ever and tons of people would hate the idea. dont ruin classics  make your own hbo. this is why you guys couldn t get scooby-doo. this was a bad idea and warner bros. knew it.
I was successful for decades  something must have been wrong!!!!. also no scooby-doo  that makes no sense
yeah lets make content that no one will watch. genius
9 01 new daphne doesnt even look asian.  only the stereotypical eyes  but her features are all wrong.  I watch lots of chinese historical dramas  k-dramas and japanese stuff like terrace house along with all the anime.  its true  they cant even woke right.  if they were going to make her asian she should at least be identifiably asian.  she has large occidental features
why not just create your own show instead of dumping on beloved characters   why does every character need baggage    you have a very good points on hollyweird  fixing  franchises that everyone has loved over generations.more to point  they aren t just working together  they are friends.  the original show would have the gang at the malt shop just enjoying not having homework and being teens when the adventure would fall into their lap.  they were never hired to solve any of the cases  they literally never asked for any of the messes they got into.no scooby   ok...this has nothing to do with scooby doo  the are just using the names and clothes at best to rant about the patriarchy or somthing or other  which makes me want to avoid this like the plague.
2 40 they projecting much  lol
its like they re on an unending quest to either race swap beloved characters or literally turn them all ugly as you can see with velma .... velma is a lot of people s cartoon crush and I wouldn t put it past these ideologues to be jealous of a fucking cartoon
literally this is an example of what a right-wing would write-up as being woke as they see it.  normally crappy scripts would be left behind.  seems like executives dont really understand society today - they just are placating assumptions.
@4 01 damn. this freeze-frame looks like rule 34 content is gonna follow next.
its not preemptive  there was backlash the second they announced they were making a series about a race swapped lesbian velma. it is telling though that in their 1st trailer they d rather shit on the fanbase of the series they re appropriating instead of actually showing anything about the show.
hey just asking where d u get thatshirt   love ur video
what bothers me the most is the new creator is carelessly wiping their ass with the original source  which no one would watch their dumpster fire of a show without. no respect for a legacy ip that has been around for 50 years almost
I think this might ve been a better plot had it not been a scooby doo ip.should ve called it mindy s mysteries or something.. then she could tell literally whatever story she wants and as long as the writing and plot are good  you ve got yourself a new  successful ip instead of creating a rip off of what you know is already popular.lame and unimaginative.
why do they feel the need to make all of these cartoons that are supposed to make viewers feel good about life  or more so  forget about life problems for a little bit. why do they have to make itstressful for us now     so Im supposed to get rid of stress by watching more stress!!!!
its all in line with the great replacement  so it doesnt surprise me.  if youre still concerned with the trajectory and desecration of pop culture icons and truly believe your critique will change anything  you ll find out that its not about profits anymore  its about social engineering.
we are living in harrison bergeron novel
typical hollyweirdo these days  take something they claim to be fan of  then change everything about it. I give it half a season  one season at best before its cancelled  and then  creators  will go on full tantrum on their twitter screaming its somehow audiences fault  for not liking pretty much everything being changed about the show .
I love it when non-fans swoop in to remake something  fundamentally change characters  change what we love about it. then they call you racist  sexist  transphobic and homophobic because they dont like it.the problem is these people have 0 creativity and couldn t make an original character if their lives depended on itso they have to butcher media that already exists. better yet companies continue to listen to and cater to people like this even though it loses them money all the time. why people cant see its a loud minority spewing woke nonsense is beyond me. just ignore their screeching and eventually they ll go away when they stop getting their way.
rigga . scooby doo
for how much money these industries make  spend  and are overall responsible for  you would think they would have smarter people making decisions. pragmatism always beats idealism when it comes to capitalism.
the media companies are pandering to a group of people who wont care to see these cartoons
by the time these clowns are done  every character I grew up watching will become some mentally unstable stodgey woke-ified diverse shadow of its former self.  why cant they just make new characters and then they can do what they want with them.  if a new character shows up  they are diverse etc  people might actually warm to them  but when hbo etc take beloved characters and trash them to please some sjw that used search replace to change  I  into  we all  when they complain about characters that aren t carbon copies of them  it tarnishes memories that a lot of us grew up with and remember fondly.I remember getting called shaggy because he resembled young me.  now thats not the case.  they made the stereotype drug-user of the group into a dark skinned guy  I cannot wait till this blows up in their face.
thank you!  I got it a couple years ago so I cant remember for sure  but I think maybe walmart lol
what I do not get is... who is this for  adults that grew up with it and still want new teenage scooby-doo content with an adult lean  because kids do not subscribe to hbo max. just confused on so many levels. not surprised though  everything seems to be burning around us in terms of media so it is just the norm at the point.
how canthey do this to daphne blake since 1969 of scooby doo where are you till now she has build so much character to be a loveable female and they took daphne and turned her to a joke. they did the scooby doo gang dirty
I dont see how the original cartoon are seen as teenagers.  it was always clear that they were in their early 20s.  they drove around in a van as a bunch of 20 some thing baby boomers having hardy boy adventures.
why is hocus pocus 2 not being talked about
shaggy doesnt even look like shaggy anymore. I seen black redesigns that keep shaggy s.... shaggyness intact.thisbpeople didn t even fucking try. they just drew a black guy  gave him a green shirt and called it a fucking day.
I dont get it.they know they will get backlash.they do it anyway.supposedly they want to please the audience so we will like the show and they will make money.instead  the displease us to the point that there is backlash.how is that profitable what s the business model as far as I cantell  its  let s spend a ton of many  please a few thousand sjws on twitter  piss off millions of fans  and lose nearly all of that money we spent on a low-rated and unwatched failure of a tv show. that cant be the actual business model  can it can it but  in any case  I cannot see the path to profitability for doing this.and these studios do it over and over and over and over and over.as if they are incapable of learning.
they ruined my childhood man fr
if they are gonna race swap they should have made fred black and velma chinese.  jeez  keep the stereotypes going at least.  at this rate they should have made scooby a whole different type of dog.  if he was originally a white colored dog they probably would have done that too.
brenda who is missing her brain.must be one of the writers.  d
idc about the race swaps. I care about them removing the 2 most popular characters in the show!! Imean the show is called scooby doo. they literally removed scooby and shaggy and replaced it with some dude. if they wanted that guy in the story just make him a separate character. I swear they just love to ruin our childhood. also this ain t the first franchise thats doing this in fact its the same thing. Im talking about the little mermaid. tho I have to admit it ain t as bad as scooby doo. its the fact that they cant bother just making a new character instead of changing what s already perfect.
how miserable and unhappy do you have to be to go out of your way to create a whole show to  stick it  to a strawman of your own making.....and the people youre trying to  own  wont watch it anyway   pitch meeting  I know  let s take something that people like  change a bunch of stuff because we think it will piss them off  and then make fun of them for being upset!!!   and they wonder why these studios are laying off people by the hundreds.
as a biracial man I gotta say  there s only one black shaggy and that..... wasn t him
given what they did to ariel and daphne  I have come to the conclusion that hollywood is racist towards gingers
awesome video new subb
velma  creators  crap on the og daphne blake for having  no character aside from being a  pretty girl also  velma  creators  heavily sexualize daphne blake in hbo max s  velma   by depicting her completely naked in one promotional image  something which even her original counterpart wouldn t go that far  sure  the og daphne blake can be the franchise s  eye candy   but the most they did was put daphne blake in a bikinI at a beach scenes hypocrisy at its finest here   and whoever who craps on og daphne blake like that obviously never seen any of the scooby-doo original cartoons.
our daphne is diverse...  umm  how can a person be diverse  a group can be diverse  but an individual  does it mean she s mixed race  thatsounds like a slur. Im confused.
imagine being so arrogant that you think youre version of the character  fixed  the character
after all these years...and someone was basically   you know what we need  woke scooby doo.  xdjust why was this necessary  I get adding creativity to characters that ve been around for a long time...but this is taken some creativity and making a bus drive down the sidewalk claiming its a bike  then wondering why people are mad they ran over those still on the sidewalk.
wow!  thatsounds very complicated.
not that they didn t go about it in a kinda off putting way but can I genuinely ask what s stopping y all from rewatching original scoob  cause there s so much content and everyone s acting like they just wiped its existence. calm down  no one ruined your shit.
exactly  they literally release a new damn scooby doo movie every year. just dont watch this one
any fandom is gonna have opinions on new content  period lol
the real daphne  not the imposter  was the pure motivation of the team. shaggy and scoob are the cowards of the group and daphne was always there to pick them up on the feet. nothing to know about the problematic white original  there s literally nothing to know about this new character other than a pathetic sob story. heard it all before.
what site is she on that has all those memes and stuff  if it is twitter  what is the url could someone tell me  I dont have a twitter but would not mind seeing those memes.
omg  wth is this woke version of scooby  that just killed the franchise for me. I used to be a huge fan. even the lego version is better than this. thank you melonie  I had no idea this happened to the franchise. subbed because of this video
I hate this day and age !!! and the people in control who are destroying everything that was good from the past...itsuck !! if you add all the changes they have made for about 10 years now  it makes me scared to see my two young kids  8 and 5   grow up in this jungle wokeness !!
there is no concept of  too black there is no concept of  too asian there is no concept of  too latino there is only the concept of  too white and here is another established well-known franchise consisting of whites in great need of  diversity
it is technically natural for an asian to have red hair  it is just rare.calling it now  fred will he the butt of the jokes  likely a conservative straight guy until we learn man s in the closet.
hollywood  looook intooo my eeeyes... on the snap of my fingers  you ll forget everything.... what the heck s goin  on!
thatsame hypocrisy existed when netflix she-ra was out. supporters and creators of the show railed against fans of the original show and would say the following  sorry you cant fap to this she-ra... the original she-ra was problematic... she-ra is suppose to be 16. meanwhile fans of the netflix show were very quick to get on tumblr and deviantart and create their own homoerotic art of their she-ra and catra. the netflix she-ra fans also failed to know the age of the original she-ra and how she was not a minor. as for being problematic the notion that fictitious characters can be portrayed as idealized versions of men and women is what many people nowadays cant handle. how dare these characters look more fit or attractive than the average person. somehow people have forgotten thatshows  comics  movies are escapism. that they re meant to be a place to turn to to get away from reality and even ourselves. I dont consume comics  shows and movies to sit and stare at the average wal-mart shopper from arkansas. I want to see idealized persons. now here s a novel idea. if people  a new creator under 35  wants something that represents them and particular demographics then make something new. create something to truly call your own  something that wont be sitting under a cloud of it predecessor. something that now and in the future those that feel disenfranchised will hold up and call their own. its lazy to bank on the name of some legacy property or stand on the top of the pyramid adding your own house of cards and think your contribution will stand the test of time.
wasn t this a cartoon character for meant for  7yr olds
its interesting to characterize original daphne as being a nobody with no discernable character.  essentially what thats saying is that unless you are somehow  special  you are a nobody and have no value.  no wonder every young person has to race out to find some oppressed identity to be a victim of.  isn t it weird that in 30 years we ve gone from a legacy history of everybody aspiring to fit in and be  normal   whatever defines that in that place and time  to everybody aspiring to be a special outcast and be anything but normal.
man they re ruining so many of these og cartoons and shows and movies to make everything  not problematic  to nowadays standards. winx  scooby doo  monster high  and a few more but those are the most recent ones I remember. what is so wrong with just having different styles and writing choices depending on the ages  why does everything from the past have to be suddenly rewritten. if they were truly a problem they wouldn t have such huge fanbases behind them in the first place.like if you want all this woke bs  just idk make new shows! stop replacing old amazing art and just covering it up with woke agendas and selling it to idk  erase the originals
first he-man now this
daphne was fine the way she was. Im so sick of these sjws trying to  fix  what isn t broken.
subbed
I dont know why woke culture doesnt like beautiful  straight females.
funny how the race swapping always erases the white characters and everyone on the left is just ok with it. imagine  if you will  the outrage that would erupt if this type of erasure occurred in a remake of any madea film. anyone remember the race swapped honeymooners movie
hail friday night tights
pretty privilege is just a fact of life. no reason to get annoyed by it  or be resentful about it. some of us were made to sweat and bleed for our living. others not so much. it is what it is. think of it this way  if the pretty people had to actually rely on hard work and skill to eat  instead of coasting by on their looks and charm  they would starve in very short order. physical beauty is an evolutionary survival strategy and it does work. to a point..anyway  they can butcher our childhood heroes and hotties all they want. it wont change how we feel about them.
hollywood just insists on ruining everyone s childhood these days not just the childhood of those that grew up with the classics but the current childhoods of many a child  tisk tisk hohoho
race swapping fictional characters has never bothered me. what does bother me is when the advertising and talking points become about the race swap. as long as the characters are still interesting  the stories are coherent  and respect is paid to the original source material  who cares what color the made up characters are. they could turn them into one-eyed one-horned flying purple people eaters  and I wouldn t care. just so long as the focus isn t on the race  who cares  Imean  you dont hear that much complaining over Jesus being race swapped to a white dude.
because they hate beauty in general.
lol that they made the guy who is thought of as the stoner into a black guy. wokeness cant help but become clich s and stereotypes.
yea I gonna change an og character and everyone should love it
making black characters white would be offensive  but making white characters black is fine. society s logic.as you said  everything thats old and good is being ruined now. good characters are becoming boring and generic and the whole lore is getting rewritten. and yeah... these are hollywood writers  so they should be talented...
daph was perfectly fine. leave her alone
if they wanted diversity  it would of been perfectly fine if the just had new black asian brown lesbian characters introduced and join the original team. I dont get why these writers always insist on changing existing characters. surely they know by now that this is the absolute worst way to introduce diversity.
Im tired of weirdos  yes weirdos thinking altering drastic things people have known for half a century not only matters  if you feel scooby doo has any impact on society get a hobby  signifigant other  a life  but makes something better has actual mental issues. I could care less about race sex identifying as a giraffe  or just wanting attention  but Ive seen the scooby gang as the same thing since I was like 5 and thats just a dumb cartoon with goofy catch phrases and solvin  them mysteries. whatever this is...eh
daphne blake was biracial in daphne and velma
how is having daphne be raised by two women fixing her  what s wrong with her having a mother and father  I think the version of daphne we got in mystery incorporated is the best. daphne doesnt need to be turned into a man hating feminist. she was fine the way she was.
this version of the gang has nothing to do with scooby-doo or the original characters. they basically came up with their own characters and slapped the same names onto them to try and make money.
2 moms  check.  lesbian yearnings for velma  check.  the only surprise is that her lesbian parents are cops  and she had a loving home  so that implies all cops aren t evil.  thats a big mistake on their part that their woke overLords will surely punish them for.
I  for one  look forward to this show. and the parade of articles still calling it racist  because they made the black guy a cowardly stoner.
im a prophet  it will flop and they ll blame the fans
let s note here that they got rid of shaggy and scooby. by far the most popular characters of the whole cartoon. beyond ruining the rest of it and totally stereotyping characters while trying to be  woke   total hypocrisy  goes against the whole purpose being  woke    they go ahead and get rid of the core characters of the show. they got rid of what everyone liked. the show was 80  shaggy and scooby. leave it to the wokies to screw up yet another thing. they have no creativity. thats why everything made  woke  sucks. they couldn t even make something new. they have to continue jacking up everything they touch. we evidently are supposed to ignore that they are sexualizing a teenager that wasn t sexualized before. and treating daphne as a sex object. that doesnt sound very progressive to me.
just watch what s new scooby doo and the movies associated with thatseries and mystery incorporated and of course the original series and the thirteen ghosts of scooby doo
to bad kingdom hearts is japanese n they dont pander to this wokeness cuz I would ve loved to see minority versions of sora  riku   kairI toonaw same idea new pitch  instead they should introduce a new world to kh like wakonda or even the harsh ends of the ghett0s then they could just have minority character model for thous world  ggall demographics covered jk  who really gives 2 duces
even putting aside the ridiculous and transparent  woke  pandering that is growing so tiresome  the creators once again miss the point that this is a cartoon meant for children.  kids dont expect or want  abandonment issues  or  insatiable needs  in their characters.  its enough that they were four friends solving mysteries.  no they weren t complex characters  they weren t supposed to be and shouldn t be!  so called adults today need to realize that everything isn t for them to spew their personal agendas through.  some things just always are  and always were for kids and they should respect that.  its just so deflating to hear the almost daily news of yet another childhood icon hijacked so the  creators  can live out their personal grievances with the world through characters that once were timeless and iconic.
the mob doesnt like anyone prettier than them.
its about time the entire cast of scooby doo were changed into different characters and scooby doo was fired. Christ  I love 2022. so stunning and brave. I was fed up of people creating new material  characters and stories. cant wait until they remake ferris beuller with a lass and her best mate is a blue haired feminist with a nose ring.
why are they attacking redheads all of a sudden
not even 10 seconds in and this video is already preachy as hell. daphne was easily the worst mystery inc member for such a long time since all she did was get into traps and that was it. it wasn t until the 2000 s especially with jamesgunn scooby doo thatshe actually become useful since she learnt self defence. from there she s been portrayed in so many different ways. mystery incorporated had her be the girly girl who took on the more social leader of the group. whilst also keeping her confidence from the movie. be cool turned daphen into a weirdo who has a million hobbies. all we ve seen about this daphne is thatshe s asian. thats it. if you want to go back to the boring danger prone daphne go ahead.
this is what happens when we let the land whale feminists into anything.  they take something beautiful and fun and make it ugly and a chore to get through.  have to reflect the real world they say.  bullpucky.  I dont watch scooby-doo because of its realism.  its entertainment meant to escape reality.  the whole point is to not make me think of my real world issues and the ugliness involved.  I want my heroes and protagonists to transcend normalcy not represent it.  hot heroes for the win!
daphne had to be asian   because anyone else cant know martial arts or its cultural appropriation.  at least thats what they said about snake eyes.
another woke remake that will undoubtly flop. they are just going to keep shoving this stuff down our throats until it becomes the norm.
ffs they completely change the character and yell at the fans for liking the character instead of the 1 note  diverse reinvention
I dont really care about the changes they make. Imean  its scooby... the lore isn t ever consistant with itself  another series will come along in no time and change it again. fine... its the open distain they have for who the characters are and what the show is. they think they re so much better than scooby-doo because they re making  generic modern edgy cartoon  342 . Imean  I get it  you wanted to make your own original show but couldn t get the green light unless you had branding... dont blame scooby for that  blame hbo!
the for the trailer is hilarious. this is literally the most hated scooby doo movie in its history
its not wrong they just dont check if the character is good as it is... they just give a little lookalso I think that fred is trans or something...
I am against race-swaps....I dont want an asian shaftI dont want an indian black pantherI dont want a white she-blade I dont want an eskimo play malcolm xthe original characters did well  thank you.its like putting tomatoes into ice-creambecause tomatoes are underrepresented in the sweets department.put the tomatoes in a masterclass bolognese  and finish off with icecream  it is so easy game of thrones very white  valerians  and nordic people.mexican hispanic  dornish.darker skinned  all of the other continent.races done right.dont just put itsomewhere and defend yourself with racism  thats dumb.look at the biggest failed experiment  dr.who.perfect example of killing a  decades-long  series by gender and raceswaps.
im offended scooby doo has black spots lol
omg this is more stereotypical then when hbo got involved  great job unracifying it by adding more races to stereotype I guess
without daphne and her father mystery inc wouldn t have even gotten off the ground  she did have lore  daphne is a core member of the scooby doo franchise and they say she had no role!  thats like saying fred s only role in the show was to be a fuckboy  what
daphne had no character  what
ignoring the horribly bad decisions to race swap and degrade the characters  what is with the brainless dead body and naked daphne  what is this show rated  scooby doo never had anyone actually die let alone be mutilated afterward. even if it turns out to be fake in the show  thats a bit gorey.who would watch this  its clearly not marketing to little kids who haven t seen scooby doo yet. adults have probably seen it as kids and are going to be pissed about the changes. Imean why else watch it again besides nostalgia and an appreciation for the original material  who is the intended audience  how do these people even get funding
even the woke are turning on this show because since velma was gay in the other movie they think she is gay in every depiction of velma but in this show velma has a crush on fred so this show is prob doomed to fail
romans 10 9-10that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead  you will be saved. for with the heart one believes unto righteousness  and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.mark 1 15 the time is fulfilled  and the kingdom of God is at hand. repent  and believe in the gospel.
the gaming community didn t care that lara croft was updated for 2013  it was actually the bestselling game of the entire franchise  so Im not sure why you keep mentioning it  I dunno  are fringe groups making a big deal about it now even though the trilogy did extremely well  I also dont know why youre going on about it affecting gaming as a whole  I think in the last year we ve mostly seen an uproar over saints row  which seemed pretty overblown to me. a lot of ppl have pointed out the game isn t that bad  but saying the game is just okay doesnt get as many views  you know what does  though  riling ppl up over nonexistent wokeness lol. I actually played the game btw  and didn t have any bugs. it was a typical saints row game  if you wanna run around with big titties out killing everyone no one is stopping you. maybe I could see character models updated to be less risque in other games  but I haven t seen anything that dramatic.I do wish traditional media would come up with new stuff instead of using anti-sjws for free marketing  though. y all just keep playing yourselves and look funny getting angry about it lol.
not a fan of scooby-doo but I bet scooby-doo is york shire terrier and not a great dane.
they talk about toxic masculinity and white male privilege but fred is literally the least liked character.  daphne isnt even that popular either.also daphne as a red head gorgeous girl is odd.  red heads never fit that vibe. they are always alt.  no  daphne should ve been blond. they just didnt want to make it look weird with fred being blond too.
our daphne is diverse and a foundling raised by two female police officers  its really the most pathetic statement put to paper. these people are not well.
if they did a parody of scooby doo  ala venture bros  I d be cool with it. this just seems off
Imade an entire video about this called  tomb raider needs another reboot or it will fail.  thatshould help you understand a lot more  Im gonna assume youre not that clued in on tomb raider or the community  but that video will help lol
1 more reason to cancel my hbo max
where s scooby
why even claim this as a scooby-doo series. seriously  they changed 100  of every character and are just using the names from scooby doo. had they just claimed it as a new adult mystery cartoon they wouldn t be getting as much hate.
they honestly think they can sell anything mystery inc without hippie shaggy and scooby-doo.....pfffffhahahahaha
they hate pretty girls cuz they aren t pretty girls
Im glad yourealized before you tatted your face
daphne was rich  white and beautiful.  this they cannot accept.
dont forget they made velma gay and shaggy  black
did they made her look asian daphne Im mean. I have a strange feeling these people never grew up with scooby doo at all. also at this point I think they are being more racist now by saying we need more represented characters to be on the show and then make it worst cause thats not how we actually are. everyone is different in their own way I feel bad for kids who are being taught this way that everyone needs to be the same and like the same.
same thing they did to black widow
in the end  its just a shameless self-insert. they want to be or at least they think they are the likable characters but when their personality and woke ideology infests those beloved likable characters they become utterly unlikable.
dude  did they actually make the black guy the stoner  as in shaggy.
wait is velma black now
the frame!
at the writers meeting in hollywood  ...alright everyone we are making a new scooby-doo remake! who has some ideas to pitch  ...  silence ...  asexual multI gendered girl with blue hair raises hand  yes  okay so what if... we make one of the characters black and gay  ... silence ... omg thats so genius! how creative and revolutionary! unbelievable! wow! we are so woke! look at us protecting gays and blacks! lets all pat each other on the back! cringe
I almost prefer the redhead genocide to... this.
those things are not mysteries ink. not at all  nuff said!
so why is hollywood trying to exterminate or destroy redheads and redheaded characters  I dont get it.
daphne is was  foundling  wtf do they think she is  a mandalorian
this I why I dont have hbo
Im not even worried about badmouthing the show or complaining. just like when I dont like a company  I ll show my distaste with my currency. in this case  Im not going to bother watching thatshyte. it just looked bad from the trailer.
so like being normal  heterosexual and attractive are problematic scoob!  zoinks!
um what these people watch  daphne was capable of martial arts and she always had some glam strategy to use in order to keep herself safe did we forget the 13ghost or the old scooby doo movies  lol
hatersgo melscooby-doo characters shouldn t b judged. it was a cartoon about detective issues  always unmasking the bad guy. thats it. poor daphnedamn haters...
they are dumb for cr claiming content creator s.  its free advertising no matter good or bad people will watch to see if they are right.
sad and very predicable at this point.  stop the insanity!
how are two police officers somehow rich  unless  she was an orphan without any knowledge of her past who was also somehow secretly rich...
the very different characters stood for inclusivity for 5 decades. time to change it for inclusivity...
regarding age the scooby do series have from the childhood to full grown adult but this particular new scooby doo seem as they are high scooler or university students so yeah nudity not apropiate  also old scooby doo had no real murders except that one hollowing special with the catwomans  as it a show for kids.
harrison bergeron wasn t fiction  who knew
so I guess brenda was the self inserted comic writer in this case brainless
you would make a wonderful poison ivy
it wasn t even broke why did it need fixing
well as long as they are changing every characters race I suggest scooby become a rotweiler cause it doesnt matter what race he is !!!
I have the biggest crush rn
I hear the description of daphne an wanted to
just boycott and dont even hate watch. its the only way for these people to get the message.
they hate pretty girls why you have a problem with that  you are not in that demographic
they are really out to do away with red headed women aren t they
hbo doing this is worse then when they added scrappy doo to the cartoon
prob abd but I take my shoot at the joke anyways
my God the memes ultra instinct shaggy is unstoppable nowwh!te privilege was his only weakness
dave chappell was rightno one cares about daphneedit- still
thats apt with your profile picture
this cringe almost killed me... send... ambulance...
made the person who knows martial arts asian and the stoner black....Im sensing a pattern.
can get a writer of the good place
lol the moment they used the word  diverse  you know thats an immediate red flag.
the originals weren t in high school. they had their own company and they drove all over the us. I have all the old cartoons and movies. only later did they highschool them.. so sorry melonie  I like you  but I am a scooby aficionado!
daphne is asian now  why not make shaggy mexican while we are at it
when woke becomes full stereotyping but say its diversity
that whole inane blurb proves that they were never actually fans of the show  this is just self insert  fanfiction  written by people who only watched the original once in a blue moon.
she s hot af
scooby doo had an asian person in tbe gang flam flan.. aka the 13 ghosts of scooby doo.
the new writer s of scooby-doo are ruining the show. how sad that these writer s rather ruin a good show that many grew up with then come up with their own content.
let s just set this dumpster fire on the shelf of failures and forget it ever existed !
the asian daphne has orange hair because........
how much do you want to bet that fred is going to be a total buffoon.
winx club disney live action 2.0
hollywood hates redheads.
how about leaving established properties alone  and use your imagination and write your own stories and characters. then no one would have a problem with it.
why are they projecting themselves onto daphne  thats kind of pathetic.
why do these people have to ruin cartoons already made  though  why cant they make their own cartoon and let itspeak for itself   ie  fail I know an obvious reason is bc a new cartoon with these characteristics would not even stand in a 6 inch pool.
this woke  scooby doo  will flop and they will blames the og fans for their own flop.
there s a serious lack of originality and creativity in the major media outlets now ... has been for awhile. its easier  lazier  to plunder existing properties and squeeze them through a social filter to make them more palatable to the current consumer.
they just sick
forget everything you know about...  how about a new ip then
ppl make these shows and do this to piss ppl off theres no reason to make shaggy race swapped amd ashain dafney doesnt look right red heads usually have freckles like daffney had
empty people cant make deep characters. they are smart in their own opinion though.
honestly  reboot laura croft is superior. weird to hear anybody have a problem with current lc.
who is hiring these ppl  whet tf happened
lol and velma is now a lesbian. but I cant get angry about it. because it just means that velma like the same thing I do.
lmao who like daphne
do fans love some series  which  oh  next on the list to be destroyed!
this gen z trend of race swapping characters  and giving them internal struggles to come face to face with their  true self ...I cant even complete my sentence I feel like puking  its so cringe and disgusting
they fixed scooby doo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  poor dog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no they didn t. they changed it. we ll fix the changes by not caring or watching them.
are theses the book writers from lucasarts
I got this idea hollywood! make  something  original! and leave all the things that have nothing wrong with them alone.
rich creeps are just trying to offend us  we just need to ignore this stuff.
personality and character development 2022   sexual orientation and skin color
boycott any and all movies for the next 10 yrs.  you see the rapid change back to canon
like omg one show revolving around velma not the gang has changed the characters while the movies haven t. what is the world coming to  so she cant be attractive cause she is asian now
its mindy kalings fanfiction
hbo  we cant be having white characters thats atrocious
@1 32 they re right... there was nothing to know about daphne.. like fuckin zilch.. hell  I just learned her last name... not that anybody cared about character arcs in the show  or background knowledge  but to say she had some level of substance to be admired or acknowledged is fuckin absurd..
so they try to empower women by making a strong one week and has issues  crazy.
why is shaggy named norvile and where s scooby
ughhh I hate hollywoke!
why does every show like this always make something showing that they know people will hate it but just make fun of the people who are mad thatsomething they liked are getting changed for no reason and then act like the people they want to watch the show are the bad guys I feel like they are just trying to brain wash the new generation into consuming their trash as a gen z Im not impressed
did these people ever actually watch the show
this didnt just start off on the wrong foot  this started off and then fell flatter then a pancake. its to a point that its beyond pathetic
why even do that... its clear these people never watched any scooby-doo after like they original 60s cartoon. daphne has had a crapton of character development in recent years. now she s a  foundling  wtf even.... another complete skip. how did scoob 2 get canceled but this is still being made
mindy kaling just inserted herself as velma in her stupid fan fiction and hbo decided to make it a show. it looks like her and she does the voice. a bit on the nose....
what does woke mean
well thats going to make a lot of people on reddit to really mad that they mess with velma there s literally a cult on there but people that love velma the way she was well this is going to be fun for hbo wow and yes Im posting this.yeah a nerdy girl with red hair and freckles its just enjoyed reading books and hanging out with her friends they had to change it apparently it looks like the also changed their body proportions too from the photo in the video so they re also body shaming velma nice good job hbo.
holy shit  I just went to the wikipedia entry and daphne s lesbian moms will be played by jane lynch and wanda sykes. I already hate this more than I can possibly describe  and Im gay as fuck.
they made velma indian  from india   not black
I guess scooby doo is dead to me.
let s just continue to be lazy and race swap old characters because its far cheaper than actually investing money in brand new characters and story lines
I got one. make the boondocks white. lets see what happens then.
who wrote this show
so they are fixing velma by turning her black
alright  alright  alright
his given name was norville rogers  shaggy is what the gang called him.as for scooby-doo   they couldn t green light an american pit bull terrier.
lara croft is suppose to be a fearless  confident and badass! what is wrong with that  I dont know why they have to change everything  ugh woke hollywood sucks.
yeah I know this wont affect hbo max s subscriber count but I ll probably get canceled fast from their app just another bad choice of theirs.
asian daphne ate dog
these people have never actually watched the show have they. they re acting like they re reinventing the wheel here.  fixing  all these  problematic  things that didn t never exist.
wait what happened to lara croft  she was always a smart  british  white woman  right  did someone try and change her
redheads must go!!!
cant have the  not like the other girls velma  be upstaged by a pretty white girl
it takes zero seconds to know exactly what the rejects are trying to do again!!! it is nothing new at all!! this have been going on for centuries!!! not just decades  or years or month or weeks  even days  this is ancient reject behaviour!!!
I never understand if youre going too far from the source material just make something new  like mike  tyson mysteries or a ventor brothers
are you dating on the  right stuff  app
her whole fucking point is being pretty. velma is the smart and plain brain  but daphne is a more beauty-oriented typical girl that can be clever and resourceful when she wants to be despite looking like an airhead on the surface.
they are erasing pretty girls because they re  female writers  not pretty so they are bitter and jealous  of acartoon character. mmmmmmmmkay.
ever since the golden generation ended I haven t seen any creative writing or uniqueness in cartoons is just the same thing over n over again u could even predict how shit going to unfold.which was hard thing to do in the gold generation n mostly importantly there is no enjoyment anymore bc back than multiple cartoons where on the same time me n brother would had to fight  which one we re going to watch while the advertisements is going on for the main one or the fact that we had to get early to either catch up what we missed or watch morning cartoons but  now they just want to ruin everything bc they cant right for shit n r lacking in the creative department.
dang everyone s typing paragraphs and shit I just skim comments til I find one that gets to the point
some chicks are just pretty with no depth of character.and tbf  we dont really know anything about any of the characters.1. dumb jock2. pretty chick3. talking dog4. wimpy burn out5. super smart sciene nerd chick but not prettywe know more about number 5 than we know about all the rest combined.
how can an individual be  diverse   words dont really mean anything any more.
hana barbra  is dead. who is given them the permission to do this
daphne was was my first w@nk
calling basic drawing prettu
stop giving these streaming services your money.
haven t 0 of these woke remakes made money  I thought captain marvel did  but they quit using her immediately so maybe not.
so if a man was a woman beater in the past. should we  forget everything thing we know  about this person
no  Im not on any dating apps
warner brothers owns the rights to scooby-doo  they sold lent some of the rights to hbo max to make this new  show .
obvious self-insert  too   loving background and yet abandonment issues these privileged people have no character and cant imagine what its like
can we please stop getting these stunted growth 20-somethings taking classic ips and remaking them to use as a therapy session to work through their own personal issues
foundling!  what is this star wars
if they want to create characters  why dont they  why do they take old favorites and wreck them  do they not have the talent to create
fred is trans  daphne is asian  velma is lesbian  shaggy is black  I wonder what they do to scooby lol.
go woke go broke
wokiedoo
lmao who the hell who will watch thisthey got rid of shaggy and scooby
diverse
they are going to lose interest real fast people are going to give up Im so glad scooby is not in this nor is scrappy they see this trash get me on the first plane back to california they race swap her wtf goodness hbo keep it up its an old saying if its not broke dont fix it
they made shaggy black  they made the stoner black I cant believe they are so bigoted! such a stereotype.
now all characters fit into racist categories lol
I really dont understand them. if they dont like the original show  why they are making remake of it  Imean - I dont like star wars - and I would never make a star wars movie saying  look stupid fans Im fixing your stupid franchise that I hate .
I never thought she was pretty. in fact she was presented as plain or frumpy I thought.
velma goes from being a smart intelligence girl  to woke trash.  lol  Im not watching this.
wouldn t this be a form of cultural appropriation  taken from a culture that at least   sorta  had their shit together  no less.
what s wrong with having pretty girls  thats so upsetting
notmyshaggy
by removing the dog from the new version they re making the show less species diverse. how dare they
that is one damn tv show that I will not be watching how about they come up with new characters instead of screwing up the classics
the woke mob cant leave anything alone!
incredible! woke gang f kd-up another classic!get woke go broke
scooby dont
this new woke generation is the worst. Im so tired of it.
its leaving a black taste in everybody s mouth!
this will fail just like all the other woke reboots  and they ll blame the fans as they always do.
you are kool beanz yo
this is so ridiculous. scooby doo Im 51 and it came out in 69 so it been around for as long as Ive been around and Ive watch all of them but this one and this last 2 movie bothered me but they are getting stupid. these are kids show. why put sex in them are they grooming kids or something  and talk about stupid most of the common sense is gone smh talk about  dumping  down. smh sorry they runt my childhood
mindy is not only a horrible comedian and actor but a bad choice . at least in the trailer we didn t have to see mindys face.
erasure of red heads is real. check it  supernatural  the scooby doo episode showed velma likes sam. obviously she is a lesbian
haven t seen a scooby-doo since I was a little kid. yeah of course they ruined it with their woke nonsense. but wait there was a body missing a brain! someone is stealing brains! thatseems a bit gruesome.
wow. so daphne is now suppose to have a crush on velma. sounds like the creator wishing a hot female was into her. chip n dale rescue rangers movie said it best. these reboots   changing old characters to make what hollywood is calling woke is in reality trashy bootleg
they act like they re for women then they make comments like that. just terrible people.
can we please fix martin luther king and see what happens  maybe alI into a blonde dude  they need fixing too...
...this is not scooby doo
these are the people who think  black  and  gay  are personalities.
mj tanner are run by twin sisters
who gives a shit about scooby doo man we dying out here
democrats want to make amouranth the new daphne
they re  trying too hard to appeal to more people which sucks
they want to erased everything. but they forger its a cartoon not real. I just gave up the intertaiment  industry  as   I gave up on lara croft . .I just. stopped   I dont care no more ..I just. give up
scooby doo fans will have nothing to do with this. kids are not gonna care because the show will suck. they are making content for no one.
its gross that they are sexualizing a teenager
know wat I thought this was gonna be another racism rant about the new races but apparently its not still not meaning I also still really care tbh
I just wish they d stop ruining classic characters and create something new.
this is just gonna be another woke remake of a show movie that flops  and after it flips they ll blame it on people being homophobic.
some race swops are fine I dont really care for example cowboy be bop  jet was white in the anime and black in live action. no problem there because mastafa shakir was a great cast for the role but shaggy !  thats just trying to hard and pissing everyone off
I have an idea for shaggy he should be a transgender dog a
I am asian and I am very very sad and disappointed at this I liked the original daphine and now what the fuck did they do to her
I always love scooby-doo the way it is they dont need some identity politics its just a cartoon for kids. let me be honest as a dark skin person when we hear something knocking we never go look.. lol white people on the other hand they have to go get a flashlight and go check that out we dont do the whole nosy thing leave that for the white people besides it is named scooby-doo why they didn t reboot him. I think everyone should boycott hollywood until they fix this problem with identity politics and these dumb soulless movies and tv shows Imiss the days when movies used to be fun now everything have to reflect the message this is why we go watch anime rip hollywood....
and whats their reason for ditching scooby  what does the woke hate about dogs
do they even have the copyright to use I guess a knock off version of ghostface s voice lol doubtful
why dont these icon leeches  try just creating their own icons instead.
no scooby no view
even if you put aside velma s race swap  the color scheme for her is awful. purple-shaded hair  orange brown skin  yellow sweater and red skirt. its an eye sore. similarly  asian daphne with bright red hair just looks distracting. I wouldn t watch this nonsense to begin with  but if I was interested  it would be difficult to watch with those choices.
why wont they just come up with their own original characters and stories instead of screwing up the classics
why are they  tv show producers  so obsessed with lesbian moms so much lately
this sounds like some bad fan fiction. I guess good writers are getting too expensive  the deliberately poking the audience aspect is a marketing tactic though. they think free publicity and angry reviews still equals more money. dont hate watch it. ignore it.
Im gonna rewrite fat albert and make them all white any1 want to help
sex sells!  black widow being a hot sexy female superhero certainly added to marvels  box office.  guys will go to movies just to see hot sexy women in hero roles and women will go to movies just to see hot sexy females.  remember the scene in thor  love and thunder where thor gets all of his clothes ripped off   they even put thatscene in the trailer just to attract women.  unfortunately  there was no reason for a guy to go see that movie and it failed.
@shigermuleye  hope so
news flash as a black man n a real man. we dont stand behind this woke movement
they really butchered this kid s show
here s a million dollar idea  if they want characters that look and act a certain way they should create those characters.taking someone else characters and slapping some flat 1-dimensional political based story on them isn t creativity.fuck.
velma became overweight
wtf
lol  making shaggy black isn t anti-racist  its super racist
of course it wont stop with the character butchering. if they cant write for established characters  they wont be able to write mysteries or any other interesting characters either. pc garbage is always about concealing a vastly inferior product to begin with.
it is funny how the race swap really doesnt help the stereotypes. brainy one   indianstoner one   blackkarate one   asiandoes not really seem all that woke to me lol.but seriously  this show is going to be a complete dumpster fire and I refuse to watch it as a die hard scooby-doo fan since childhood. I ll be laughing as this show bombs horrifically.
I know what Im not watching
they do this because all attempts to make original diverse material has been fubar. they cant create so they desecrate beloved material . Im happy to watch a diverse cast if its good and not preaching at me .
companies are just lazy af now. they want to make money quick by remaking old shows woke instead of creating new shows.  what s next  black flintstones
what a disaster. if it wasn t for those pesky hbo execs...
they could have just gone with a continuation with new characters but nope got to change and race swap instead because they are activists who are creatively bankrupt.
Imean daphne was kind of a boring character but changing her race isn t gonna fix that.
you look like pokimane
just a thought  but have you seen what tattoos look like after 50 years  might want to check it out.
no scooby no watch. pretty simple. how can you literally remove the most beloved character in the show  my prediction for the new shows success  two ruh-rohs down
this is such a cliche to write daphne as
I wont be watching  I will stick with amphibia
so instead of being hot and wearing purple she is now a redhead asian lesbian
wtf
so the lessons for the video is again go woke go broke hbo max or classic scooby-doo is better even 13 ghosts of scooby-doo was good compared to this not actually kidding
woke is cringe I swear...
can we stop cha
dontcha know
ah yes  casual hollywood racism  things there have never changed
wait  they made the stoner-character black....I have yet to see the whole video but my guess is daphne was dan in the past because feminity is only accepted in trans-girls nowadays
aaaaand then they go and make velma gay to make things even worse. I grew up watching scooby doo and loved it  there was plenty of story going on without shoehorning sex into the storylines. this is just more attempts to sexualize kids. it is sick.
Imean they purposefully made her to look like poison ivy from the new harley cartoon show so... yeah another gay.
jinkes.
thats the modern-day left. make everything we like  1000x worse than the originals. making a product no one wants.
if youredo the origin story for superman he probably should be a minority farm worker blending with either black or mexican.  daredevil son of a tough boxer and a nun. definitely mexican. spiderman would be an obese kid. not skinny. plastic man was a janitor. when was the last time you saw a white man that is a janitor   its reasonable to update origin stories.  this isn t that. this is folks who wanted to do their own stories and couldn t get their stories approved. zilla is a decent movie. it has nothing to do with Godzilla.  other reboots may be decent stand alone but this has nothing to do with scooby doo.
Ive loved velma and many of her cartoon reincarnations until last one was abit bossy and less intellectual.but this one... this one...look how they ve massacre my girl.starting to feel more and more like their representation in film and shows are over 50 .their butchering existing ip s just to  pigy back off the already established fan base.like dude make your own show and  characters stop rewriting existing ones for your horrible fanfic that no one likes.Goddamn it!
we didn t need any backstory lol its a child s cartoon
scooby-doo without scooby is like food with no salt. bland and boring
as a blk man Im highly offended they changed shaggy into some stoner black dude with crappy twist. I dont like none of the changes. Ive been watching scooby coo since the 80s   I have never in my life heard a black person say    man I wish they would change the sexual orientation and race of the characters it would make a better show   lol. they have to stop with the nonsense
another show and set of characters destroyed ......
asian with orange hair  wut
Im cool with fleshing out or modernizing the origin story.  like the fact that they investigate mysteries makes sense that they should have parents or uncles or aunts or somebody that investigates for a living. child of cops  adopted  ok. two moms that are both cops is kinda shoehorned. cops being prone to domineering domestic violence. bad platform. adopted by cops child of a fallen cop solves mysteries I can see. the moms being roommates raising a friend s kid rather than lovers that randomly adopt makes sense. showing murder and mutilation for minors is bad. promoting sex with minors bad.
let s be serious here evenly straight to vhs and straight to dvd movies of scooby-doo franchise probably would have better production value than these episodes airing on hbo max.
more woke trash. ok Im kinda old  grew up in 80 s and 90 s. I loved scooby-doo when I was a kid. now Im a mom to teenagers. my boys grew up with mystery incorporated. I hated what they did to velma in mystery inc. they turned her into a conceted  b  word  that dates shaggy and tries to change him and is jealous of his relationship with scooby-doo. now they ve turned on daphne. why would anyone want to watch all this crap
when I heard they where making a bloody scooby-doo series I was so excited. than this shit dropped and its probably the most disappointing thing to happen to me show film wise. Im pretty open minded to new stuff but this is fucking trash.
at least judy is still white. lol.
I am tired of seeing frumpy girls in new games and movies.
I wont be watching this   neither will my kids.
seriously  the woke culture makes me wanna vomit out my own liver  stomach and intestines.... I wish it never existed in the 1st place  wokism. not scooby doo  lol
they are stupid  they should just make new cartoon with new characters.
why does everything mindy kaling touch turn to shit  smh
hbo preemptively coping before this trash releases... how delusional canthey be
cant wait for that flintstones remake where fred is a stay at home father and wilma goes to work  impregnates fred with a transgendered pebbles and barney with his race swapped wife betty adopts a mixed minority baby.
I do not have a problem with any characters  any strong characters from any denomination whatsoever the fact of race swapping a person just for the mere service to diversity and inclusion and ideology is flat out wrong. the point of the matter is like the scandinavian countries or the country so far north that people of color were never seen for thousands of years so their culture and ethos and folk-tail  would be about their ancestors of long ago who were the same as they are today  but no we have to have race swapping color changing gender changing all for the sake of making somebody feel better about themselves and destroying somebody else s culture other than people of colors culture because all of a sudden God forbid if ryan gosling would play the black panther in wakanda forever part 3 see the uproar of how many people would just start to protest all over the place but yet a mythological character such as king arthur to be played by a person of color from a culture that was predominantly white for thousands and thousands and thousands of years that come from a celtic druid folktale and ancient storytelling of their culture has to be destroyed so that people of color can feel special about themselves and feel included and for the namesake of diversity. this is where you get the push back from its not that people have any kind of problem with strong characters and people of color playing lead roles its lazy storytelling and stealing a built-in fan base that has been there for decades and decades and stealing a character that has been loved and cherished by many generations and youre too lazy to be original and come up with your own characters so you have to steal somebody else s hero and make them whatever gender whatever race and its lazy storytelling and lazy writing and classless and unintelligent storytelling the fact of the matter of having a black superman called clark kent and his adoptive earth parents martha and jonathan are all played by people of color just for the namesake of diversity  but at the same time nobody has a problem with a black superman because there are actually two black superman one of them is actually the president of the united states and the other was from krypton and defender of the universe black superman and yet you want to take clark kent after 75 years of him being a big old white boy from smallville with jonathan and martha kent as his parents changed and race swapped to be people of color ultimate diversity and inclusion a thing when its already been a thing  and also the woman king is another movie that needs to be banned outlawed because they are lying and bastardizing history for the mere fact of promoting strong independent women into a role where it was a slave nation that participated in the transatlantic slave trade and also the slave trade around the world with brazil argentina china india japan european slave trade and sold slaves all around the world and yet they re trying to say they were selling palm oil and they didn t sacrifice over 800 slaves when their king died and yet thatseems to be fine because youre promoting a woman king as a strong independent woman that can be a slave trader and sell her own people into slavery and kill her own people because she s a strong female woman king that really is a queen but anyway both are powerful I dont know why you have to call a woman a king when a man is a king and a woman is a queen but this political ideology needs to get out of our culture once and for all and people should be judged on the merit of their character and integrity and not by the color of their skin..just saying..
so a s s is a word that will delete comments after 20 sec and colo niza tion looks like it too
oh God......  they cant even woke right woke is literally stereotyping and trying to pawn it off to a crowd that couldn t collectively find two brain cells to rub together to create an independent thought. fred is probably been made some off brand of gay  obligatory daphne is asian nowstoner shaggy looks like a jamaican  racist much  and velma looks like a direct descendant of meg griffin and cleveland brown. Jesus. scooby     he s actually identifies as a horse and the gang s plug in electric ford transit van cant pull a trailer so he s left in the barn for the entirety of the series.
I guess I ll be  that guy  again. is no one going to mention the notorious druggy is now black  thatseems a little tone deaf.
I dont care about the velma series. velma doesnt deserve her own series.
I hope this fail hardcore
God those character designs are awful
not my show...how about just change to a new ip
I ll just watch the original hannah  barbera versions. I though scrappy doo was a mistake. this new stuff is horrendous. no wonder kids today are suicidal basket cases.
this is stupid I definitely wont be watching they love to ruin classics for no reason
daphne has red hair. she had to go...
this could ve been good if they didn t add their communist agenda in this  also if they had scooby doo in it as well!!!!
hate this new age trash cant just have a new movie with the old gang even the scooby doo meets courage the cowerly dog was good dont change it add new chapters for our childhood ip s
I hate daphne s outfit  just... what
no scooby doo...then its just four irritating teenagers. no thanks.
next be racing games!no more those expensive and pretty cars most people cant afford! thatso not realitic. racing game be llimited to car from thatsuper afforable shady second hand car shop.and instead of the cars performing well  i.e no personaloty  and looking pretty  the car would break down almost always and have denst and  cracks all over  making for more time for the car to show off its  personality .
why ruin a good show  my childhood just make a new show. these people are racist as hell lol
if I hadn t already unsubbedafter finishing harley quinn s3 btw awesome!!!!!! I d totally unsub again because of this unholy hot garbage fire they call a cartoon
I hate this in every way. just why though  why is everyone trying to push an agenda in remakes and movies
why the fuck did they make them live in a town called poortown
comments are getting deleted after 20 sec
they black washed velma lol  but then black people get mad when you white wash characters so much hypocrisy
I hate shaggy s redesign so much he looks weird no that chin I hate it like I hate itso much I dont know why but it annoys the crap out on me
I unironically love scooby-doo  so Im not watching this garbage.
daphne is a little to cis white for 2022.
democrats  not even once.
I do not like these changes they ve made - ruining my childhood nostalgia for woke politics!  not planning on watching this either.
dont care about these hollywood garbage remakes.  they ll make it  put in their political bs  insult the fans then accuse everyone of being a phobe ist when they dont like it.  yawn.  if it is really good  Imay watch it but let s be honest... it wont be.  why remake a show when you have contempt for the fans of it
stop crying. ohhh they changed my favorite show! thow shows been 80  the same for decades and geared for kids. this is a adult show and changed to fit what the creators and network wants. how you guys think you know a show is bad based on looks is baffling. btw the characters are now adults and even then only the original show were they like seniors in hs. here they re like adults mid 20s or a little older due to the sexual nature of the show. so dont like the makeup of the show dont watch.
I just noticed they made velma black as well. lol where s my asian gay mario  people keep pushing diversity  but my asian community keeps getting left out. I want my asian mario  asian master chief  and asian superman. if youre gonna race-swap for the sake of  diversity   maybe dont exclude it to one race.
I have cousins and buddies who are gays but we are not americans. they told me why do yanks always want to insert lgbtq everywhere  we are not a brand. why is is so important for them to have gay stuff  whats the agenda  why cant they just make there own gay or lesbian characters
I guess coolsville wasn t good enough
youtube filters comments sadly  even though I untick the box
this show is gonna be a dumpster fire. the original was more diverse than this shit.
removing the shape of people does make it easier to promote trans in place of it.
this is worse than skyfall. like if they wanted to make their own characters fine. but this is tacky.
the velma series looks ngl
why cant they just leave the classics alone and come up with some new character or show   and why does everything has to be woke or have to promote homosexuality
oh look another skin suit remake designed to  subvert  a pop culture classic.
not going to watch this. yuck. daphne was always my favorite character because she was badass. way to ruin her
I am so sick of this garbage why  fix  something when it was already working. like just stop trying to insert woke identity politics in the show. its so sickening. velma was never black its totally uncalled for.
I was the first generation of scooby doo viewers in the early 70s. I gave f all about fred  velma and daphne. the only scenes that mattered had a scooby and shaggy. I never cared about their lives. this show was for 7-9 year olds! no one cares what these characters think. go solve some hairbrained mysteries hatched by greedy old white guys in masks. isn t that woke though  ffs.
is thatsupposed to be good  to be without a father   lol .... no offense to anyone who grows up with two parents of the same gender  but we need both genders. we need fathers and mothers. and I hate the term  mothering  like     anyone can mother a child  no... you can be a parental figure  but to mother someone  is something only a woman can. thats why its not called mothering when talking about a father.  we each have our important impact on the child. me growing up with only a mother present  and a dad too focused on himself  was not good balance. I have always gravitated to a father figure in my life  because I never had it. thats not something two mothers could fix.    daphne isn t a deeper or better character because they  fixed  her--- lol    just leave cartoon as they are thanks.
this is just garbage. this whole woke crap. Im latino and not once in my life did I get sad because none of the scooby gang was brown  or anyone in Lord of the rings. they are fun characters in great stories. and thats what matters.
was velma black in that picture  how original blacken every character possible my as well change mystery inc. to hood incorporated  and make them all black in one go also make all black gay as you like to make so many black gay in all this new production  as if you wanna make all black gay and erase them from earth due to lack of reproduction.
daphne was my fav character....now she s some freakish copy...thnx for ruining her
just wait for the transexual version of baywatch
ah yes  dooby foo... the crappy version of utter crap.
this show will suck
are people really complaining about rewriting of fictional history of cartoon and video game characters who are a thing of fantasy  race swapping of cartoon and computer generated models. you people need to sit on a professional couch or get the hell off of the internet.
its gonna be shit
another programme I ll never watch - and no doubt be labelled a bigot for not subjecting myself to it.  guess what - I dont care.
horrible !!
terrible art and concept  why would anyone watch that trash  and true  people who continue ip s this way it exudes laziness at best  which is not a good look and should not be taken seriously at all.
just create an original product. really lazy writing as always. eric july has found phenomenal early success with his comic book because its an original creation. he created a black hero and somehow ppl are gobbling it up  I thought we were racist
I advice to boycott all the cartoons who are inappropriate for children  I would certainly let my kids watch this brainwashing crap teaching kids about sexualization and lgbt. there is a limit to everything.
wow  this sounds like total crap.
so I know this is an unpopular opinion but... what if everyone just.. stops watching tv. like all of us together just sold our tv and never looked back. we get our entertainment from our computers.let them keep their frumpy velma and token race fetishism and we just abandontv altogether.
this is lazy and dumb.
dont be selfish not everything is about you. it just a cartoon for kids
who cares   get a better hobby
