if anyone needs a history lesson on lara croft  melonie mac is your answer.
as a member of generation x  i remember the time when tomb raider was released. back then  the developers based her image on cindy crawford. they first wanted a guy but they didn t want to get sued as a rip off of indiana jones. that was the story then  my how things change.
saying   audiences weren t ready  is a cop out  because no one was polling audiences to ask them.  it s answering a question they never bothered to ask to begin with.  any statement such as this is an assumption based on nothing more than their own ideas about what they assume other people felt.  the kicker is that when you make massive assumptions  there is a large possibility that you re completely mistaken.
a character isn t  raceswaped   or any other swaped  before it s released.literally every single character in existence go trough a lot of changes in development  you can t just pick a random point of development and say  it was swaped to something else   the character couldn t be swaped  because the character literally didn t exist yet.
she wasn t. she was changed in development. different thing.
her concept art actually is spot on angelina jolie when she did the lara croft movies. more than i expected it to be actually.
i didn t grow up a lara croft player fan like you  but i thought from afar that it made sense that lara was smart about history and travel for hidden treasure because london has probably the best history museums and artifacts in the western world  if the back story was that she was educated in them as an upper class london aristocrat going to the museums but as an adult craving adventure  that story makes sense to me .
1  she can only be  race swapped  if there was a previous tomb raider before tr1 with another lara croft being of another race.2  why should we even care  seriously  there are people whose goal in life seems to be to create problems where there was none.
it s almost as if they were going through a creative process and went with something that would work better in the given context  like every other project in history.
plenty of characters go through phases in development  so i think the  race-swap  argument is debunked.thanks for the video  melanie and god bless everyone
i m at the point with tomb raider that unless i hear your perspective on matters related to tomb raider  i don t trust other outlets talking about the franchise...
i could ve sworn a couple years ago they were saying lara croft was problematic cause the creator based her off a rl crush they had on a fellow employee and so then made the model in her image. idk these stories keep getting retconned to fit whatever woke narrative of the day is.
even then the tanned skinned early days lara croft can be explained away by her being in the sun a lot and her skin tanned. i mean she is a archeologist
at this point nothing a naughty dog employee does or say holds any weight to me.
melonie sees some shit about lara and goes into professor-mode.
toby guard is the epitome of a man out for himself. i respect him immensely for creating lara. but he seems to find it easy to throw his old team under the bus to save himself.
lara croft is iconic and everyone actually love her.. the fact that they didn t think people would like her shows they ve never had a clue what people actually think
i guess after the april oneil debacle they re gonna make these claims about all characters now
why does nobody bring up a rhona mitra   she s the original model for lara  she was the model before they established the games or began production and was such an inspiration they kept her on as a live model  and she was the actual source  inspiration  and model that lara os made to resemble.  there s even pics of mitra dressed as lara from before the game came out  it was one of her first gigs in entertainment.
one of the first designs was originally a man not too different from von croy but he looked too close to indiana jones that they changed it for fear of a lawsuit.i believe one of the devs  exact words at the time was  where s his whip  are you serious
i m here to answer the call!
@melonie mac go boom  time to activate the tomb raider bat-signal.
@nick napoli  is it crossed browning hp  the signal design.
i heard somewhere that she may indeed be a fan of the character yes.
as some wise person had said  if you didn t learn from history  nothing can save you .also if the take cames from a neutered dog person  stay away. the virtue signaling is gonna be hard.
excellent boom
this is the second time i ve seen someone saying something something with a double meaning and it gets a positive reaction from her. last time it was a double negative. is this a trend in his channel  lol
@melonie mac go boom  so are you saying that no money man can win lara croft s love  and it s sweetness that she s thinking of  she always hangs in a buffalo stance  and does the dive every time they dancce! she give s you love baby not romance  she makes the leaving nothing to chance. so don t you get fresh with her!
@melonie mac go boom  i mjust starting this but please tell me you addressed the elephant on the room that is rhona mitra   she is literally who lara is modeled after and it s a very open fact
i was saying the same thing there is no way in hell game devs made a game based off of one hit wonder that nobody outside of the 90s remembers. give me a break. next they re going to say that buffalo stance was the original theme song to the game too  .
waste of energy waste of time there s no way in hell people would look at her differently in the way they look at angelina jolie i was just watching the first tomb raider movie everything from beginning down pack cannot be touch
trust me  i m gen y and know they always said she was based off of her. not some latina singer.
they based her off of a british model actress named rhona mitra originally
@geoffrey chauvin  the same actress from the lycans underworld 3 and doomsday yeah i remember that movie the skyline trilogy i have part 3 so i can understand that. but you gotta understand something she wasn t ready and angelina jolie is all they had at first they said it wasn t going to work but after watching her do her own stunts taking risks like that success the first female game adoption to movie
@zero todona  no i wouldn t work first and foremost can she do her own stunts and second can she act singing latina music is good and all. but that don t add up to what angelina did in our first try knocked it out of the park it s like when i play underworld .do i see rita a little you know but i see mostly angelina and that s why i m glad tomb raider under world was the closing chapter of her series
no swear words.  no crazy talk.  just stating facts.  and my comment before this is censored into not even being shown.   yt is a joke
this was of course before the game was actually published but the character had been established visually
it s funny cause in 95 the devs did a tv interview and claimed angelina jolie was the base model since day one
@ipasandsunshine  lara croft was not modeled after rhona mitra. rona was just a model who represented lara at conventions  and isn t even the first one
@melonie mac go boom  yes. and if i may add some info into that  in brazil hellen roche representes her in conventions too and she s the hottest hands down
@melonie mac go boom  melonie. look up lara jones comics.
@melonie mac go boom  well  your answer is not correct. neneh cherry is not even latina. she s from sweden.mother is from sweden and father is from west africa.
@ceceli  for someone who seems to be a grammar-nazi  you might want to check your sentences before posting them.
and then uncharted happened with a guy lol.
same here. no one talking about the gender swap  since the main character of tr was originally a man. as a huge tr fan since the original launched i m glad it was changed to a woman. i could careless what nationality she was  but now that she is british let s keep her that way.
i remember her being called lara cruz in gamefan magazine back in the 90s but she was still a  white redhead  presumably spaniard. i never heard of her being based off of an afro latina rapper that nobody ever heard of even back in the 90s.
@geoffrey chauvin  i very much doubt that  considering miss mithra was  if memory serves  the third model asked to represent lara at the various conventions.they d have asked her from the word go  if lara had been based on her.miss mithra was the model who most matched the in-game lara at the time though.so that might be the cause of your confusion.
lol yep
i never saw anything about the character s image based on cindy crawford.   you would think the character would have had a mole at least.
@geoffrey chauvin  no they did not  rhona mitra was hired by eidos as a promotional live action model for tomb raider ii in 1997 which helped to jump start her movie career. she was barely known in 1996 when original tomb raider was realesed. lara was created as a mix between indiana jones and tank girl  with her female parts exaggerated to create an action icon that would speak to younger generation. which they did succeed.
just false virtue signaling
@geoffrey chauvin  rhona mitra as tr came later as tr s  face . not before tr was designed
@lucion volkhvy   to be fair i d say they probably named every possible top game woman at that time hoping to be associated with her hahah
same here iv read and still have magazines from the late 1990s and not once was she mentioned  based like that description  unless it was some concept that never made the first cuts...
well said! i doubt this was thought of during a time when we had stars like michael jackson  michael jordan  shakira  selena  george lopez  salma hayek  etc..... audiences weren t ready.  bs!
i constantly heard devs back in the 90 s saying gamers don t want to play as women. nobody buys those games. but yet we had tomb raider which proved they were all wrong! and what man or woman doesn t want to play as a character like lara croft ....
this is some progressive arrogance that makes your skin crawl.
@w1llki11edsnake07  people who aren t fans of lara croft  tomb raider  or just playing as a woman in general.who are you to give names based on someone s preference or bias
yup  we re talking about a time where media had the most freedom. lots of  offensive  movies for example compared to now. they didn t give a shit about what audience was virtue signaling back then. xd
yeah. if there s a singer that s an activist but didn t succeeded  or didn t want to succeed  at virtue signaling  that singer is neneh cherry. she is very much engaged in all sort of causes and was popular in the early 90s but she deliberately changed her sound because she wanted and disappeared from mainstream.if they had based lara on a mix of neneh   tank girl  teenage me would ve thought it was pretty cool. the generation from the 2000s absolutely ignores how much race wasn t the main focus of 90s entertainment or at least it wouldn t make people feeling guilty about it. but the developers of tomb raider surely grew up before the 2000s  bunch of weasels.
@uchiha sasuke i grew up with the belief that comprehending sarcasm  historical context was a sign of better mental capacity than just understanding the literal meaning of something  at least among people who were interested in more alternative culture...nowadays it seems people can t detect nuance anymore. that s why so much  canceled  buiicrap.
not to mention there was no  audience  at the time. gaming wasn t mainstream  it was for kids and dedicated nerds of all walks of life. and core design was just a small semi-unknown developer for derby  england. tomb raider became a worldwide success almost by chance. and yes it did contribute massively to the popularity of gaming  bringing it to the mainstream  as did the original playstation on the hardware front.
@flupetepak  its still considered niche...on most major channels in uk and europe there are no game news shows..they used to be but they are all gone...also its on the decline overall  after hitting its peak ....
they didn t think people would buy games with non white male main characters. this is something people have told me for years. it s one of the reasons they didn t go forward with black kratos  even though they won t admit to it. they made him light brown and then covered him with white ash  even though they kept his voice actors black.  were they wrong  i think so.
@shamanwinterheart  honest question  are you trolling  isn t kratos greek
@flupetepak  not trolling. yeah kratos is greek. but his original concept was an african warrior  he was black. they eventually went with making him spartan though which is the version we have now. i m sure they had their reasons but a source did tell me that they didn t think anyone would buy a game with a black lead on the cover unless it was sports related. who knows. if you watch his origin in the first game you ll see that he was light brown before the ash covered him. so they either made him mixed race or just a tan white dude with a black man s voice i guess.
lol yup
that s the most bs argument ever you can get race swapped if it wasn t even out yet
exactly.spongebob could have been a disabled lesbian chick in early development and john wick could have been a trans furry. that s obviously not what he ended up getting.
@booming bob  nope
@amador cortinas  wot
@booming bob  she was always going to be british they were throwing around ideas for her race but when they got to her back story they decided to keep her british!
@amador cortinas  that s wot i was trying to   probably badly   is that it can t be raced swapped of it was never released and it wasn t planned anything else than one race
i agree.
yeah this is dumb  whitewashed  argument for characters before they even existed has been coming up a lot lately. april o neil was going to be asian at first. i even heard someone try to argue that neo from the matrix was originally black because will smith turned down the role in most cases it s a complete lie to excuse blackwashing white characters like the lie about kingpin was going to originally be black in the comics which is a total lie made up to excuse the michael clarke duncan version of kingpin
@booming bob  but you know what they ll change her again in a few years anyway so it really doesn t matter all the current audience care s about is being represented they don t even care about the characters so i ll stick to the original first 2 movies and the animated show and even the nickelodeon show is better they have always were the best versions!
@amador cortinas  tru they can t watch it play a character without relating to yer race because goodness they play something that doesn t look exactly the same i can watch an asian drama and relate and last o checked i m not bloody asian
@booming bob  same i relate to anime characters and most of jackie chan s characters  even females and i m a straight latino male!
very much this. before doom went into full production in the early 90 s  doomguy was originally conceived as four separate characters  two of them female.
@amador cortinas  i m a straight christian white man   the blueprint og everything hollywood hates   and i relate much more to anime and asian dramas than i do any other piece of media because well the west isn t that good and after you watch something from the east everything becomes a downgrade
@booming bob  that s probably why i m not easily entertained especially with today s entertainment in the west!
@thatyellowspiderguy  oh  so they didn t even go back to the original race in the new movie. wow  asian-phobic much oh wait  right  it s because anime is doing so much better than western entertainment ...
@amador cortinas  same i either watch old stuff or torture myself with the shite we have now but if i do its either animation or asian drama one hour of attack on titan made me more entertained than anything disney has made
@booming bob  this is true  thanks for reminding me that i currently have the first half of the fourth season on blu-ray i still haven t watched!
@amador cortinas  it rlly iz   attack on titan i had to read to prevent getting spoiled again shd now watching it get animated had a new feeling altogether especially that 1 hour long event  even cw shows are more entertaining   even tho most are cringe or bad except king fu   than most but it s funny how sone of their chi is better than disney but yea asian media just makes the standard go way up
@booming bob if its just in concept stage and the character goes through different designs how is it race swapping  race swapping is a negative connotation. its a character design a concept presented many are rejected many are accepted but then replaced its how every project works.
@thatyellowspiderguy ironically will smith is technically a blackwashing actor since he played agent j who was white in the comic books.
@booming bob hollywood doesn t hate you it just prefers to market to a weird culture that sort of does hate you for profit because capitalism i guess.
@booming bob dreamworks is doing better than disney anyways.
@chandller burse  exactly and universal
@chandller burse  race swapping didn t bad per say but they way they do it s bad because there s a definite reason why they do it
@booming bob  everything does have a problem.humanity itself is a problem lol.
@booming bob  i hardly even watch live action films anymore because of this!
@booming bob  that s not how the creative process works. people consider different takes on characters before deciding what they will be in the final versionor did your comment mean   cant  rather than can
@chandller burse  i think who will smith played in wild wild west was also a blackwash
@leon evelake  i meant to say can t
@amador cortinas  same if i do it s either old or actually good
@booming bob  actually good is the important thing.
@amador cortinas  that s the important as but it has to good in quality and story
for real man. i agree
@internet mouse  agreed as well
that being said  i would have liked latina lara croft. we all know latinas are hot af.
so they are crying cause the idea started as a mix    then the game started a white brit    that s not changing the character  it s the concept and concept change
exactly. the final product determines what s official  not the unreleased concepts.
exactly. you can t race-swap a scrapped design.
totally agree
@eddard greybeard  well then  better not let them hear about how she actually was first conceptualized as a guy until the creators were afraid of being sued for indiana jones copyright infringement  haha!
boom.
i was thinking that too. i was like angelina jolie was literally lara croft personified.
and it just sounds exciting
well that  and there s the period of time where so many archeological discoveries were made by british archeologists  so it would be incredibly fitting given her age and the time she broke into popularity that her father  or grandfather  most likely  would ve been such a bloke.
british doesn t mean white. she could be mixed.
@yaron elalouf  yes  we all know  nationality  has  evolved  to mean  whatever plot of dirt her mother shoved her out on. prior to the current year meaning of nationality  it did very much mean  white.
@eddard greybeard  it seems like you didn t enjoy nationality being evolved.
@yaron elalouf  native british does mean white and mixed is a tiny  very tiny percentage of britain.
looking back at it now it does seem that the direction it went was for the best...im a fan of ancient relics and tomb raiding but ... a  faster pace was needed with more action....
these people are the ones to yell  fire  in a theater  just to claim they saved the theater people from a fire.
haha good!
i get a tan from walking around the annual heritage festival  watching cultural dancing and eating food that long weekend. but according to  those people   i m race swapped. it s 50  joke and 50   yeah  they would think that way. .
@thatharvguy   you re right
when i used to work outdoor i got so tan i was mistaken for a mexican once. i still get a chuckle out of that.
he definitely used some very misleading words  context in his tweet  no doubt
not surprising there  probably ship her a lesbian as well like what they did with  chlodine  in their offices. lol
what does naughty dog have to do with tomb raider
this is from an naughty dog employee but they never worked on tomb raider why is a nd employee talking about a games concepts from a different company despite how close some sony companies were back in the day i doubt someone who ask a insomniac employee about the making of jak and daxter.
@norman readdis hose chlodine is nadine and chloe lesbian now i never saw this from any of things i heard and watched of the lost legacy.
@chandller burse sorry  i m being shadowbanned. but i know you can still see it.
i was actually happy that toys for bob took on the crash bandicoot property  because i don t trust current-day naughty dog to do that ip justice.
@the isaiahnator tawna bandicoot got the intersectional treatment still but if it was neutered dog  tawna and coco will be the couple. lol
amy hennig was part of crystal dynamics in 2005. when cd aquired tomb raider  she asked if she could work on it. eidos  the publisher  told her  no! get back to work on legacy of kain sequels  like they killed core design by forcing them to make a tr game each year. she then left to naughty dog  were she created the 3 first uncharted... by 2014  she was working on u4 with a smaller team because the majority of the staff was on the last of us  so when it became a success  neil drunckman became the cool kid for naughty dog  do the studio  nicely  fired her over  creative differences  to put him at her place on u4...
it is my duty! lol!
they re trying to tomb raid her history. lol
straight up i m the same way about this character
@norman readdis  for lara that s a no no  haven t you seen enough
@amador cortinas if they made lara a tomb protector in the reboot. they ll ruin her more in the future. i m not holding my hopes up for amazon.
@norman readdis  amazon who made rings of shit hell nah
i wouldn t doubt it!
yeah. i mean they do it with history too. saw a guy claiming the vikings were really originally black
well she was hired to portrayed the promotional model of lara in 1997 for the second game. she still looks like real life lara to me though.
was she the original lara  i thought there was someone before her.
one model did a promo before her on 1995  was a very short thing and she was promptly replaced with rohna mitra who better do the image through concept.  the original model did literally one event.  as of the second game they completely revamped lara to resemble her  and even in the new games she again was modeled further after rohna. many don t know but rohna is not fully white she s part bengali hence the exotic facial features.  since 1996 i was always under the impression from the staff that made the game rhona was in fact the image used to make lara croft.  that s also one of the things that makes the argument she was supposed to be a brown person more hilarious  she s half bengali  that s india.  she is a brown person and lara at least from the second game forward was so he image of this woman  further making the argument hollow
never knew this. when i first played the game it was lara croft. i cared more about the gameplay overall. when the game first came out nobody cared of her ancestry  it was how fun of a game it was to play.
i love how  over 10 years ago  if someone had just said   hey  lara croft s name   race used to be different   literally no one would care. because it does not matter. her character matters. and lara will always be a badass!!
i also remember many years ago that the reason why she had certain extenuating features was because in the game environment it would be difficult to see certain details or features on character design. not all game environments just certain ones
the amazing thing is that people who weren t alive at the time won t understand that literally no one cared.  everyone loved the game  everyone loved the character.  if it was laura cruz written as an interesting character  everyone would have loved that as well.
i m not just saying this because i m an english woman. lara was a brilliant character because she was so different and unusual. back in the late 90 s  sassy latinas were ten a penny. a posh english lady who could also shoot uzis mid back flip was so original and unusual. her englishness and poshness made her stand out even more than other video game protagonists.
last minute suggests that somehow in the 11th hour they just reskinned remodeled her entire character because ... whatever.in a day when we were playing as bandicoots  geckos  earthworms in spacesuits  a bear with a bird that pops out of his backpack  etc.
i love that there are people on youtube that are actual experts on characters between you and rippa on april this is a crazy time we live in when we have subject matter experts in these cultural aspects.
according to toby gard her image was based on tank girl and his younger sister you can read his interview in the independent from sunday 18 april 2004 and for the dudes saying neneh cherry was a one hit wonder she was kind of big in the 80 s
breaks my heart to see what the woksters did to lara
here comes the professor of tomb raider and lauracrift herself to reveal the real history behind it
hey melonie  i love your passion for og tomb raider  because i love lara croft tooalso if you watch the bonus features in the tomb raider 2001 film with angelina jolie  they literally explain her original designs and really changed her name from laura to lara to make it more pronouncable!
well  i guess every character needs a history lesson now just in case anyone gets confused when their favorite character gets the chubby black make over. great video. i will definitely be doing back ground checks on all my favorite characters from now on.
anytime anyone creates a character a decision has to be made on whether they ll be x race and x gender. changing something in development isn t changing  or race-swapping  the character. the character really doesn t exist yet. post initial appearance is completely different which makes me wonder. why don t these people have an issue with ariel  leon  mary jane  etc.  who have been altered recently despite having already appeared on screen
would love to see a stream of you playing the original lara croft
hi melonie  i am in germany and i really love your clear view on issues nowadays. please go on with this. in former times i was an enthusiatic movie watcher. i couldn t wait until new movies and even i enjoyed the disney cartoon even they are made for kids. but now the number of movies i can watch and enjoy is really low. especially in times when the real world seems broken it is so important to buy 2 hours from reality and just enjoy. they have taken away this from me. so please go on as it make me feels i am not alone with this feeling
it s quite simple. if i enjoy a franchise  i want the character to be how i remembered them.
agreed  even in the legend series she was pretty tanned  though. i remember vividly in my childhood  i was secretly jealous of her golden-brown skin  in the new games she is definitely a lot paler  and pales in comparison to the bombastic  buxon beauty she was in her previous incarnation. maybe the company will go back to the original concepts one day  here s to hoping.
chronicles of narnia  bruce wayne  lara croft -- seems like similar backstories now that i think about it. thanks for teaching us
personally tomb raider was a whole package thing  which is why i loved the character just as much as i loved playing the game. she wouldn t be the same without her sultry posh accent and very british mansion butler. given how she would often fight as dirty as she gets crawling around in tombs  having the balance of what seems like would be an uptight english woman is what makes her a strong but feminine character. i think if they d stuck with a latina concept it would ve made her too sexy and too made for men for me to have really loved her character. but i m also talking about personality and i think we all know by now all that matters to these people is how much melotan someone is injecting and not actually their personality.
i think there have been some movie and tv characters that were at least somewhat based on lara croft. the one that immediately comes into my mind is the character hillard in  alien resurrection.  she wasn t a lead character but i did at the time and still do get sort of a lara croft vibe from her.
that s because she was always lara croft in the final product. while the character was in development the creators came up with new ideas  and i m glad they did. sassy latinas were ten a penny in the late 90s. lara croft was original and ground breaking
not really. goofy british characters were all over the media back then. i think it really doesn t matter when it comes to lara croft laura cruz  though. in the end she was always designed as a white-skinned brunette.
@jean bethencourt  she never said goofy british characters.
how many sassy latinas were there i don t recall any in gaming and not many in films.
@gambit771  i said that. because that s what they are.
she had a few hits and was stunningly everywhere.prefer her brother s music.
yeah  teachers can be wrong also.
me too. hi there!
there s an endless amount of excellent films from the history of world cinema waiting for you. you don t need to wait for new movies.
a lot of people feel the same as you  it s just the psychos are the ones who are heard.
i ve always thought the claim that there weren t a lot of female gaming protagonists kind of strange. i started gaming in 1990 and i remember there being quite a few back in the day like alis - the main character in phantasy star and one of the best rpgs of the 80 ssamus aran - you mentioned her in the video but super metroid was one of the very best video games of the 90 sprincess peach - in super mario bros. 2  her floating ability gave her more aerial control during jumpschun-li - this girl was so popular even with male players of street fighter ii that we started seeing her everywhere. toys  posters  t-shirts  you name it.sonya blade - probably the most op character in the original mortal kombat. that leg grab was almost impossible to avoid! she s still extremely popular.kitana - the best character in mortal kombat ii. this princess led a rebellion against her evil father s rule in outworld and those razor fans... wow!black orchid - she was on the freaking side of the arcade game! can t get more  leading lady  than that.terra branford - final fantasy vi s main protagonist. still one of the best in the series. alisia dragoon - one of the all time best and most underrated sega genesis gamesdixie kong - since she debuted in dkc2  she s been one of the most popular characters. and that guitar solo...nina williams - this femme fatale assassin was always one of the most popular characters in tekken.lara croft - you already know all about her. joanna dark - the original perfect dark is still one of my all time favorite shooterscate archer - from no one lives forever. like joana dark was also the star of a popular fps seriesi m sure there are plenty of others but that s just off the top of my head. gaming was filled with great female protagonists in the 90 s but i rarely saw many girls playing games back then. maybe it s cause girls prefer less fighting and shooting and more role playing and adventure  but this revisionist history needs to stop. there were plenty of female protagonists.
wasn t lara also inspired by comic book heroines of the day   besides tank girl  i also remember hearing that penelope cruz was an inspiration at one point  but i m not sure how true that is. i can t speak much on tomb raider  but as a mortal kombat fan i am very familiar with ppl taking creator quotes or concept notes ideas out of context and using it to construct false narratives.
being latin has nothing to with race or ethnicity. for crying out argentina soccer player alexis mac allister is scotish.as lara croft  adrian heath-smith said intially the character was named laura cruz but they changed the character name to lara croft to make the character name sound british out of the fact britons have a hard time saying spanish names.for the record i have the g4 old g4  tomb raider documentary.
love this channel   respecting the original source  explaining and giving attention to lara like she deserves and yes people just because a character isn t pale doesn t mean she he its afro....there are other races thanks melonie
i know if i ever want to know anything about lara croft  melonie is my go to. have a good day melonie
lara croft is a beloved character. we will love her no matter what race she is. i just wish they would stop ruining her story. great video melonie!
interesting. i never knew the true backstory of lara croft and the inspiration that conceived her.
larry bundy jr did a video on lara croft ages ago  toby gard made lara croft in the image of his sister frances gard. google shows info about it online from 2004 from a quick look.for why he left id bet internal work politics  that s what happens most the time. maybe some thing as simple as not getting the pay he wanted or the position he wanted.ps from the uk it s more likely to be spanish than latino.
tomb raider misinformation - melonie mac activated!  seriously though  i thought this was widely known  with an article shortly after the 2001 film came out asking what would have happened if they used the original character with jennifer lopez playing her instead of angelina jolie.
as a child of the 80 s i have to say you could do a lot worse than being based on neneh cherry. she had some solid hits.
another lead female character around that timeframe  you could make the case that terra is the lead in final fantasy vi.  1991  even if you split the lead role in that game  the narrative is told from the perspective of terra  celes  and the figaro twins.  when driving the story  you are required to have at least one of those four characters in your party.
yoo melonie i love when u talk about tomb raider
i think people get to caught up in peoples opinion. she wasn t made sexy but her character is something men would find attractive. that s cool about the story part of it. i think i remember playing the slide spike pit part when i was like 7. i ve never beat the game. my favorite games are ps1.
idk how or what a singer rapper would do too inspire a video game character that explores ruins for lost treasures and stays fit by training constantly for the fighting  parkour she does. not to mention the stamina she s been building up over the years of her explorations.
they should go back to the older design respect for pyramid boobs.
i think all the reasons for that change were explained in this video and the massive success that followed those changes proved it was the right call.  nuff said..  drops mic
i don t really care about race swaps. i just care about the intention behind it  which nowadays is out of racism from what i know   i just mainly care about the actual personality of the character. it s sad that lara went from a tough yet charming adventurer to a weak and always scared survivor.
that was a great recap  mel. very informative. i do have two points to raise though. 1  didn t any of the creators watch a pam grier movie  regarding dark skinned female leads. 2  being a londoner myself  i can say it s we who have a problem pronouncing words with r s in them  as it sometimes sounds like w s. i presume most of these creators are toffs and from a privileged part of the uk
i grew up in the late 70s  and my family watched little house on the prairie every wednesday night. we watched melissa gilbert grow up over the next 10 years playing a character named laura ingalls. why on earth would they think americans didn t know the name laura  or how to pronounce it  laura was a fairly common name in america for a long time. weird
melanie mac throwing out facts as always  hope she dont get cancelled one day
no. it was rumored she was considered for angelina s role in the movie  but ofc that s just speculation no one really knows. could have easily just been a penelope cruz fan with some wishful thinking. lara croft as a character was definitely not based on penelope cruz at all.
thank you andrew!  d
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
that and not change her personality either but the british accent and background will always work the best for a number of reasons most are discussed in this video.
yeah  it is weird to hear a brit say latina and not spanish.i think he s been hanging out with too many yanks offer the years.
that s tr3 one of the india levels. tr2 is still my fave but tr3 was good.
the look and attitude  not their profession.
yeah that s correct she wasn t changed for that it was just normal changes throughout development they probably threw around ideas but she was probably always going to be british!
i learnt a few things too  well  that explains some of her latino like features and why there was a slight tint to her model in the game.also  i did think it was meant to be laura and not lara  sorry for us brits stereotyping usa people back in the day. it came from  the image  presented on tv versus what we can see of each other these days with youtube .i thought they were trying to give her a  pinnacle of feminine body   and the assumption of  sexualization   to represent more a  powerful but petite woman  as a show of  strong women in gaming  so to speak  aka true feminism in gaming done properly and in a relatable way  unlike post-2010 neo-feminism alt-feminism .still laracroft as far as i m concerned is still a good representation of females in games for the time  given the biases of the time .
there s no one who knows more about that character than melonie mac.
i m not saying it was aliens.. but it was aliens.
i d think  they  would be more upset that lara was an endangered and extinct species mass murderer! where s peta  lol great history lesson   i remember making the demo discs for her first few games.  back in my day
another point is that the lighter complexion has more to do with the character being played by angelina jolie in the movie. they frequently change a characters appearances to more closely resemble the movie version.
her legal name is lauryn hill croft she ll be headlining a new british rap group called wokees
hey melonie! glad to see you re doing better. you look amazing and your hair is very pretty today.  hope you have a fantastic day.
people complaining about development changes now  kratos went through several versions. claire redfield used to be elza walker. hell  everything about resident evil 4 changed so much in development it became devil may cry. canon only exist after the game is released to the public
i couldn t understand why gard had to come out and say that he was against lara becoming a sex symbol  that he opposed to that  that he argued with people from marketing  that he left the studio because he has less saying and creative over his creation and bla bla bla  but instead he was involved in tr legend and that game was a lot cinematic and showed a lot of femme fatale lara. this don t make much sense to me. the game even stimulates players to achieve unlockables like costumes and even a bikini as the hardest trophy to achieve in completing 100
the majority of players for the first tomb raider was teenage boys which i was at release. i could sexualise a pack of playing cards as a young teenager. lara being a strong  beautiful woman with large assets was easy to be sexualised by any teenage boy  but as an adult i can say she definitely wasn t a sexualised character by design.
i read the title and i was like  oh boy mac gonna go hard on this one
what matters is when the character is published. any changes before that is obviously in the brainstorming phase
have you ever thought about writing a tomb raider boss fight book
just like han solo was initially a giant green alien resembling something like swamp thing.
i haven t seen the movie yet  but the situation can t be good if melonie looks like she is checking her pulse in the thumbnail lol. i am sorry about lara  i know how you feel.  master chief in silver continuity was both naked and now dead and possessed in the end.  hes my fav game character ever.
i think that s why they got angelina jolie to play lara croft.  she did have full lips and spoke with a good british accent
my grandfather worked landscaping for years in landscaping  he looks mexican so much that in arizona they would try to speak spanish while sneaking over the border. he has a permanent tan that looks  mexican  and yet is 100  dutch.
of course the person virtue signaling is from neutered dog.
i remember reading an article waay back in the day that laura s name was taken from someone on the design team who actually was named lara croft or something like that. i could be wrong. but i m so tired of all the raceswaps. if you change lara s nationality  majority of the fanbase will walk out.
hopefully her name doesn t change in any newer games or anything  because the name lara croft stands out better to me. but that may be because that s what she s been known as for so many years. also why do some people think only certain ethnicities of people have big lips  i have a big lip and i m white.
i was all about that meme for years
peta is busy going after games workshop over their overpriced plastic figures having plastic fur on plastic armor  and  rescuing  animals to be sent to slaughter shelters. you know  trying to beat lara at mass murdering animals.
like what insomniac did when they recently remastered their spider-man game.
but but but april o niel but but but laura cruz... this people are trying to find a hole to virtue signal.
elza walker looked basically just like claire though lol.barely a difference i guess capcom liked her design and just rewrote her character.kind of weird how they scrapped the entire original concept of the game because it was not scary enough and too action oriented but kept leon the same mostly but for some reason felt elza needed to be changed.
they alien-swapped him!!!! how evil!!!
this. he hasn t been the same since bungie abandoned him.   the logical thing would have been to get steve downes to voice act him and not face reveal but what do us fans know...
rewriting history in front of our faces...
lara cruz could still make for an awesome rival turned ally made to be lara s match in almost every way. that would be a cool new plot.
thanks for continuing to fight for tr and lara croft  i hate what they have done to her
i think that angelina jolie did a fine job in the two lara croft movies  not only looking the part  but in voice and character as well...
don t worry del from naughtydog. raceswaps happens all the time nowadays as well  difference being they are already established characters and not concepts of course  like  lara cruz
i can t believe people grew so stupid with internet that they can t comprehend the concept of  characters change as they are in the concept desing phase i just wish for this world to end
i m pretty sure she was based off of cindy crawford. i do remember there being a small controversy at the time about the size of laura crofts breasts as depicted in the game though. tia carrere starred in a show heavily influenced by tomb raider called  relic hunter  that was in the early 2000s.
i really wish they wouldn t backtrack so damn hard just to fit in  i mean nina cherry  she had a few memorable annoying songs but yea c mon they are trying to re-write history now   paleaassseeee spare me  and i really wish they wouldn t mess with lara s original looks she was perfect until they started trying to tweak her  the continuity is so bad.  ty for your great vids melonie loving the lara croft history stuff!
anything anyone from naughtydog says is grounds for immediate dismissal.
you know  i can see it.  i always thought she looked darker than her family and had assumed it was an adoption thing.  i kind of wish that was made more clear.
just because the ethnicity was changed during creation  doesn t mean the character had their race swapped. before publication it is only an idea.
it s better that she is british because they have great museums and are stereotyped as being archeologist  and a little odd. she exists on a spectrum ranging from nena cheri to a butch tank girl hanging out with a mutant kangaroo sidekick  to angelina joli.
why not just add the character. maybe laura cruz could be the inspirational mother figure in lara croft s life that no one really knew about.        _ o
also it does not count as a race swap during the dev cycle for an og character. it only counts if they do it after they released her. she was released as british and white.
i only learnedly about this  although not too recently  through the likes of larry bundy jr  and that probably also explains why she didn t look too caucasian british until square enix s reboot series.
i wonder if the new lara croft will  reflect the world we live in ...
this coming from a naughty dog dev is quite troubling... look into the back story of some of their own characters and how they looked early in development.game development back when tomb raider was first being made you created a concept character and proved you could do the gameplay end of things  then you sorted out a story. the story was always a bit of an after thought late into development so damn near every character in games made in the 90s started off as completely different.
melonie is a lara croft fan  i had no idea lol
... but still no games that revolved completely around a heroine.  some games that revolved completely around a heroine prior to tomb raider  1996  that i really enjoyed playing as a kid  and still remember to this day   all of which were franchises popular for their time ms. pacman  ms. pacman  - 1982metroid  samus  - 1986phantasy star  alis  - 1988king s quest iv  rosella  - 1988golden axe  tyris  - 1989metroid ii  return of samus  samus  - 1991golden axe ii  tyris  - 1992king s quest vii  rosella valanice  - 1994super metroid  samus  - 1994whether or not this would be considered cherry picking with regards to disproving the statement  i do know that there were more that i did not play  and most likely even more in other countries that did not receive localization for the us. the gaming market was actually quite diverse throughout its growth in the 80s  with regards to the types of games you could play and the characters that were in them  if any  especially in japan . lack of knowledge regarding that is mostly due to the fact that access to games and gaming  especially as a hobby  was not widespread. personal computers were not common  popular household products yet  i was lucky in that i had a relative who worked for ibm at the time who would constantly bring over the latest and greatest hardware . gaming systems did not have the huge market outreach that they do now. things really didn t start to take off until the 90s with regards to hardware access and popularity.then there s the advent of the internet  and the various muds that spawned as a result. while those aren t traditional single player games with main characters  it could be said that if you created a female character in gemstone  1988  or gemstone iii  1991   you would technically be the heroine of your own story in that multi user domain  as would every other female character created by someone else since they were role playing games.
there aren t many british game characters anyway especially lead characters. concept art changes all the time and has variations of most characters.besides they could add this character design as a playable character who could get her own spin off game.
lara croft was never seen with her family in game though except the short intro in chronicles in which can see her parents visiting to her  grave .
i don t think it is necessary at all. no need to apologize for anything or make anything right when nothing wrong happened at all. this is all normal character creation development  so there s nothing they should change or do to explain it
@melonie mac go boom  you got me there
don t forget alys from phantasy star iv  1995. she was one of my favorite heroines from my childhood. technically she was a deuteragonist  since you start the game with both her and chaz in your party  but she was a strong force in the story and a tough lady in her own right.
there actually has been a latina lara croft in live action  sofia vergara played her in a 2003 visa commercial.
those were just concept designs duringdevelopment. don t really mean much if it didn t make it to final product.  lots of characters in games  movies etc can be completely different during development and draft stages.
the father of rhona mitra  the british actress who modeled for the original laura croft  is of indian descent interestingly enough
not sure how much of their statements i can even believe going off their own wiki  neneh cherry  the famous singer  also said to have inspired certain aspects of lara s character  also said to have  - this means they have zero proof of their claim. she looks nothing like lara croft. going of their thought process  he was inspired by any woman with big lips in his field of view. more culture vultures taking things out of context and exaggerating to steal what they can t create.
oh  the name part comes because it s actually said  l-ah-ura   not  lowra   that was the argument that settled the name as lara in the end
as i watch this one of my first thoughts was - i need to go watch the buffalo stance video by neneh cherry
neenah cherry was awesome. the music was produced by the wild bunch.... before massive attack.
oh man! tank girl is such a good movie  i think i ll watch that tonight. i love remembering old good random movies. especially since all hollywood is pumping out now is shit.
when the character is in development  it s not called race-swapping because the game isn t released yet. it would have been race-swapping if she was latina in the first game and then changed to white in the second game. during the concept stage  characters go through a lot of changes.
i always imagined her skin being so tanned since she travels a lot xd
no true lara croft fan  my self  is missing any sleep because she was race swapped  the lara cross is still an amazing character and well beloved series
was it your first appearance on a nerdrotic or drinker stream where it was said you ve forgotten more lara croft facts than we know
everyone likes to mention metroid.here are some othersphantasy starultimakings questgolden axeevliraaliensdaedalus encounter  not technically true  as you play casey  but it stars tia carrere super mario brothers 2  usa zelda  the wand of gamelonall of these came out before tomb raider.some are even series.
i like lara croft just the way she was created and don t care about any early design version of her.
i have no clue how the developing of a characters design can constitute a race swap lmao
so people discovered character concepts goes through different iterations in it s creation cycle. why do people like to act brand new to everything
the fact that people are getting mad over a concept art aka an early version that didn t last long is absurd and it just shows you that people are getting mad if a character is caucasian and not from some type of colored background or look white which lara croft wasn t in the classic 5 games and legend cuz she had a bit of a tan to her in those games while in the survivor trilogy she was a pale white despite all of her time in the sun.
he  still  thinks about it   this is the first time i d ever heard about it.  most of the time  they talk about how it was originally going to be a male protagonist.
then make laura cruz and lara croft team up. i d be down for that.  as long as it isn t ridiculous  but we all know it would be at this time
wow  i hadn t known this. it s rather interesting to learn of a character s early concepts.  a  topic!
it would be like calling aragorn a race-swap because he was originally a hobbit in the early drafts.
r34 would be down for that
it s interesting to see this presented in the original posts as seemingly negative   changed at the last minute    audience wan t ready    isn t this what the diversity crowd demands  for reference  a few years ago a book called  american dirt  was the subject of  controversy  because it s a book about a mexican immigant to the us  written by a woman that is neither mexican nor an immigrant. if that is objectionable  surely a british studio is only entitled to make games with british main characters  yes
also  there s a difference between race  ethnicity and nationality.   i am latino  born and raise in the caribbean  unlike most us latinos that have never been outside the us or even speak spanish   or portuguese  my parents and grand parents also  mostly. but i am tall  thin  very pale  the kinda that veins are easily spotted and get like a tomato with little sun light. that plus my long straight hair and facial features.  make me look  white  to everyone  in the us some people won t even believe i m latino.  turned out that some of my great great grandparents are from various places in europe. but genetics are weird and not only skipped gens but don t always activate.  between by siblings and first cousins we cover all shade  from light hair and eyes to darker than will smith.so lara croft ethnicity could have mixed roots  but that doesn t make her any lest british  specially since her parents are aristocrats nobles now days those titles are inherited by old times.  and you must be direct to inherit them.  and i know this cause i have nobility on my family tree  yet no one in my close family is.the name is bs  cause people in us have no problem saying laura  nor would they have any issues with cruz.  in addition  so angelina julie is afro latina   cause she is the vision of lara  lips and all. and last i checked she was american from american parents.  they do know that not everyone in a country looks the same do they   or race for that matter.  natalie imbruglia  white asutralian singer  look at her  torn  video. quite the lips on her.  the woke mind virus make people dumber.
i think the afro-latina part is due to ppl bringing up neneh cherry. would love to c mabel dressed up as lara doe! make things come full circle!
race swapped before the game was released  i don t know how that makes any sense. it s one thing to race swap an established character in an already existing and established franchise  but saying lara got  race swapped  before we ever even seen her is reaching a bit  i think. that would be like saying that faith from mirror s edge got race swapped  to asian  just because there are concept images of her being also a white and a black young woman. devs just experimented and went with what felt  right  for the story and atmosphere they wanted to create.
great coverage melonie. i was waiting for some tomb raider news. i think this is just a brain storming phase and regional issue. name one british character that stands out  i think developers knew to many american characters saturated in the market. i don t like the rebel gangster lara concept it just doesn t fit the character considering she collects artifacts.
i just found your channel and like and agree about lora croft
even if its corrected i am too far deep into believing the lara croft i know. i dont think my mind wants to erase the glorious performance of angelina jolie. she has left an imprint in my history with that banging.... cough  physical performance respectfully
so she never existed as anything else as lara croft  from the uk. they just didn t go with the other characters. that s not a race swap  that just the other participants not being chosen.
i think it really doesn t matter when it comes to lara croft laura cruz. in the end she was always designed as a white-skinned  suntanned brunette. the name change doesn t really affect anything.
this used to happen all the time back in the day  in the original re 2 we didn t have claire redfield as a playable character until later in the development.also as latino i don t think this would be beneficial to the dev team back in the day because in those times we didn t have internet like now and we may never got the franchise that it is now days. i never play games because of the race of a character blade is an awesome character but i m not black  geralt is awesome too.lara croft   regina from dino crisis  eve is a cool villain on the original parasite eve this are part of my favorite female characters but i m not a woman.maybe they can just add her as a new character on newer tittles she can be a rival and later a friend of croft if they want to experiment with it.
heeeey  i didn t know laura croft was based off of neneh cherry.  buffalo stance  was huge back in late 80 s. haha. she s british so i can see how it fits.
in a world where selena was already a bona fide worldwide sensation  a latina video game character was just too much for that same world to handle... s i could only buy the excuse if they just came right out and said  hey  none of us knew spanish  so that s why we kept her a white chick. they always come out with the more complicated lie.
was she technically race swapped if she never made it to the screen as cruz
yeah i knew that  it was because they theorised a game like that would do best in the uk market and it worked
if melonie retires from content creation she could teach an entire course on tomb raider lol
incoming black afro lara the second amazon gets wind of these perpetual whiners.
to play devil s advocate  if the game designers did change her race because  audience s weren t ready  it says absolutely nothing about audiences  it only says what the executives think of audiences which may or may not indicate racism on their part but at the very least shows a disrespect of the audience by those in charge making the decisions.  how can people lose sight of something so obvious
it don t matter who she was inspired by  the point is the british chick is the established character.
the concept for tomb raider originated in 1994 at core design  a british game development studio. one of the people involved in its creation was toby gard  who was mostly responsible for creating the character of lara croft. gard originally envisioned the character as a man  company co-founder jeremy heath-smith was worried the character would be seen as derivative of indiana jones  so gard changed the character s gender. her design underwent multiple revisions and redrafts during early development. is 100  cherry picking the woke agenda
me   sees title me   let me grab my popcorn and 3d glasses for this one.
i m actually replying some of the older tomb raider games right now  ledgend   underworld   anniversary before i tackle the new updated trilogy . i ve owned them for a very long time just worked to much to play video games and i never got to finish them  well now i m going for platinum trophies runs on all of them. tomb raider is still my favorite franchise to date  not to sure about the upcoming tomb raider game though
funny cause a tv interview in 95 they all said laura croft was based since day 1 on angelina jolie
if they kept it the original way. neneh cherry would sue the living s  t out of the tomb raider developers.
just seems like the story keeps changing.
people spreading lies about lara croft melonie  hold my g-fuel
lara was never sexualized in any tomb raider game.she was sexualized in goons raid her  lmao
2 me lara is great the way she is my favorite version is her survival timeline version of the 2013 reboot
i heard another version - in order to avoid copyright infringement they had to make the character a woman because the character as a male was coming off like an indiana jones knock off.
there were games with women as the main character like alisia dragoon  el viento  and yoko in vail games.before tomb raider.
rhona mitra as  lara croft  the best there is the best there was the best there ever will be !!! . her father is of bengali indian descent  her mother is irish.
hey melonie. you look fantastic
miss mac may be the foremost expert on lara croft in the world.
we can just look at super metroid on snes released 1994. super metroid you are with samus aran  and you know she s a woman start to finish it  finish in 3 hours and you can see her suit and helmetless. super metroid is a masterpiece  it s one of the best 1p games of 90s.
why not put her in the games as a playable character and rival that d be badass
i m sorry but the  red head  concept art doesn t look latina in the slightest
the way this design looks is really good. honestly  they could repurpose it to create an entirely new tomb raider character.
really which game or piece of media was she lara cruz in  before she was laura croft
i m sure latina lara croft would never let them take away her curves. as a latino myself  i m not salty at all and still thing angel of darkness was the best she ever looked. bring that back as a skin please!
surely the creators of the character had the option to make their character anyway that they saw fit  who is to say if they made her the way they originally conceived of which was during the initial design phase which is open to changes that the character and game would have been as successful and as well received  that is not to say that it wouldnt have been successful another way but we will never know and seeing as we are stil talking about the character and the game some 27 years later they probably made the right choice at the time  tbh though yeah the character is great and appealing  but for me it was the gameplay and puzzles in the game that had me hooked  something either is what it is or it s something else.
they going to turn her into something that looks like an unrecognizable human that could be confused as a non gendered ninja turtle kind of like daphne in scooby doo and april o neil from nina turtles. damn we are getting dumber each generation.
that would be like a bizarro type rivalry.  o
they didn t even change the design  that is literally tomb raider 1 s lara croft lol!
that s kinda what happens when you buy games that are more movie than game. i still think alucard from sotn  not netflix  was an awesome design. and an awesome game
they  nehneh cherry  picked the data. hahahaha.okay  i m going to go now.
a dedicated lara video  but we can t get a lara tangent that way  lol.love that they wanted to make the protag british but then made her such an anti-hero  self-interest motivated type anyway
i just bought an old psp off my housemate so i can play some classic tomb raider!
there were many famous latina actresses in action movies when tomb raider came out  so everyone was kinda ready.
abraham reyes- i shall dedicate this victory to laura!john marston- it was luisa...
i just thought she was just tanned because she was going to exotic hot countries but was actually white but just tanned.
well rescuing princesses is a no go now  mostly
buffalo stance! good song from back when life was fun   thanks melonie!
all this information was stated on the tomb raider annyversary book.
if she wasn t lara cruz when the game released it s not a race swap. btw the only reason to truly change it was to make her more acceptable in japan and east asia at the time. the u.s. would have given zero fucks. saying lara was race swapped is like saying god of war is responsible for k-9 erasure from gaming. for those unaware  at one point kratos was designed to have a k-9 companion. these weirdos are really reaching with this nonsense.
core design made rick dangerous which could a blue print for lara croft.
if this happened during development  then she was not  changed . because this is how characters evolve. from concept to final product. not a single character that exist today has started in the way he ended up being. they all go thru numerous changes and adjustments  just look at concept art for any character. they all ahve different  often completely unrecognizable  variations and models. from their personalities to their looks.also during lara croft creation nobody gave a shit about audiences being  ready . because they had no way to know. it is just another one of those modern leftist takes  based on nothing.
i m of the mind that prefers core eidos s uk s final preferrence to lara croft being brittsh rather than laura cruz - and not because the initial design for the titular tomb raider was south american.  it s jus something i already grew up with before some people started bitching about lara was originally supposed to be mixed-race.   core eidos was footing the bill for the creation  so they had the final word in how the character was created.    as a matter of fact  laura cruz lara croft wasn t even supposed to be originally female.   toby gard created an indiana jones derivative  but then was asked to change it due to possible copyright reasons to avoid being sued for aping indiana jones - thus the next iteration gard made was laura cruz.  again  the studio had final say  so they turned laura cruz into lara croft.   so  to make this really complete - you could say that lara croft wasn t orginally a raceswapped character  but also a gender-swapped one.   the  raceswap  only came after the studio rejected the male indiana jones derivative and redesigned the tomb raider to be female.
i ll give you one guess what she will look like in the new tv series...
if nintendo owned her nobody would be doing this. you should tell nintendo to buy the rights to her  and turn her back to the way she was.
i wouldn t mind rosa salazar taking over the role.
the change in development was a smart move if this story is true. when you think of archaeologists or experts on history wild life - you think of professors with a british accent or david attenborough  not an someone with an afro-latina accent.
tbh  i was never a fan of lara croft  but at least it is an original character. it s not like they made a female version of indiana jones by gender-swapping  they had a specific origin and name  that is how new characters should be introduced in today age as well  i am talking about you disney  lol .
you know never once thought about her race. just her abilities  i guess i was wrong
when i was growing up  canadian sesame street had french language segments and usa sesame street had spanish language segments. laura cruz would not have been an issue.
originally she was a guy  too.
so now that this is out there  it just means rule 34 will be busy.
everytime they find a excuse to do raceswapping
jill of the jungle was a game with a female lead that came out in 1992 and had sequels but sure there was no female leads in video games before tomb raider....
that is news to me. i never knew this info before  and i don t really care. i still like og games
and now 9 out of 10 games have a heroine  it s gone the other way.
nene cherry was huge... everyone would totally have played a character that looked like nene.i doubt the inspirational sources both nene and tankgirl were about only  looks  both are tough take no bullshit archetypes
lara croft is british  that s what ended up in the video game itself. yes  early on in development she was latina  but this changed later on. so the hell what ! why is this so damned important
unreal has a female protagonist and that s one of the original boomer shooters. if you stretch the definition just a little bit
yes back in the backwards times of 1996  we all attended klan meetings on the reg. we weren t ready for a female hispanic video game character. when chun li showed up in 1991  several american cities were burnt to the ground during the ensuing riots. they wanted to avoid a repeat.
there was nothing out in the world to show the swap. it was a pre-design vs a finished product.
i can t believe they are going after this historic game classic from 1996...  i don t think anybody cares about laura being latino british  gamers would accept her regardless
sooo lara was the original dora the explorer..
who cares what particular physical characteristics were used for lara s final design. she is what she is now  and to find an excuse to make it into a   race issue   is just clear evidence of certain people wanting to pick a fight to fill the empty void that is their existence.
i never understood this  gamers don t like to play female characters  sentiment. sure in certain genres  like fps games  probably not  but you don t see the character anyways. but in third person  i think for most male gamers it was always rang true that  if i see the character for hours through the entire game  it rather be a female . altho tomb raider was the first big tps game  so before that it s probably not a true statement. but ever since then it is.
they always got to make it about race don t they...
if it was during concept stage  before it ever became a game  then who cares race swaps these days happens when the character has already been established  and already had a movie game series comic book.
naughty dog employees try not to randomly cause controversy challenge!
so sorry to hear this  she was different enough from her original character and then this.    at least you keep to the originals!
according to toby gard her image was based on tank girl and his younger sister you can read his interview in the independent from sunday 18 april 2004 and for dudes saying neneh cherry was a one hit wonder she was kind of big in the 80 s
actually   most people don t realize that ian fleming originally intended for james bond to be a korean    chemsu bondu .
give dora guns and she becomes a more accurate lara then the current one right now. xp
tomb raider 1 lara was perfect  i m happy with how they changed her in the development stage. just not with what happened after when crystal took over lol. and thank you!  d
@melonie mac go boom
never heard this before  ever.
just because a character went through changes during development doesn t scream  race swapped  to me.  it would be like saying that the character was gender swapped during development because they wanted to distance themselves from the indiana jones films  so they made the character a female.  but ultimately  what happens during development can be interesting to hear about  but it isn t canon.
just google search who is lara croft based on. its a british model.
very loose on the term race swapped. how many characters were different before release  they weren t swapped because there was nothing there before.  well  i was thinking dumbledore should be persian   tonight at 7  dumbledore was race swapped before publication
thanks for the video melonie mac.
concept art doesn t supersede original product.
a lot of yts aren t mixed and i am opposed to changing croft s race to poc
of course lara was race swapped. what a surprise.......what i hate now is that they re starting to making excuses by saying the concept art is the real source and not the final product.
it would be better if they. used the old designs and made a new character another vault hunter that competes with lara.shit they can even go the half-sister route.
there s quite a bit of cherry picking  in situations like these  when don t these idiots cherry pick
you think current reboot lara looks more white  the first reboot lara looks more like a younger version of the original lara  in her face at least  while her new look is leaning more middle-eastern and she looks like she s 40 with 3 kids. her hair is also getting progressively worse with these weird side-fringe layers that look highly impractical. i always viewed original lara as english with a bit of italian greek in her blood  she doesn t look racially ambiguous to me.
never understood developers who think guys don t want female main characters.  when given the choice in games i usually play the female character.  no deep reason to it. sometimes it s because the female character has a better voice actor mass effect for example  but the main reasons if i m gonna spend dozens of hours playing a game i would rather look at a pretty woman than a guy.
2nd comment.. i just want to point out.. back when this game came out we had rosie perez who was popular  and tv shows like in living colour which had latina s on it etc etc so to say  we werent  ready  is a lie lol signed someone  who remembers the 90 s well.
as i watched the video i couldn t help thinking of how pointless the whole thing seemed  not the video of course but the post the guy made on twitter.  what was his purpose  to throw shade at the customers for  not being ready  as he put it   was he trying to insult the development team or make us think ill of them   if that s the case then all i can say is   well darn  let s get a time machine and fix the thing that made you unhappy.  oh yeah  we can t do that  sorry .  that s the problem with stuff like this  it presents a meaningless problem for the here and now  and by attempting to throw into a wrench in our idea of past events it simply starts a fire that burns for no reason other than the destruction of foundations that are otherwise really strong.sorry  i think i got off topic there  i ll just sum it up by saying   lara croft is lara croft  she s been around since the 90s  get over it .  i still need to play the old games actually  most of what i know about the character is from the old top cow comics and the movies  i saw an old playstation at an antique mall recently but sadly someone else bought it before i could.  oh well  maybe next time!!!
i found out from guru larry on fact hunt! shameless plug haha
i get a little annoyed with the  we didn t think the audience could handle it  statements. translation  someone in the decision tree couldn t handle it and blames the fans. a hot spanish lara would have done just as good. it s all these one dimensional   garbage written  ugly characters that we reject  that they hold up as proof the players are racists sexist whateverist.
this is due to the fact that stories like these help gather funds for organizations to lobby for reparations for slavery period in the usa. blm made incredible money and founders defrauded lots of funds from it and obviously  everything is racist you just need to point people to it  is a commodity. at least in usa and likely uk too as obviously post colonial ountries are on target for getting reparation funds  like germany recently paid to one country from africa. so if someone wonders why anyone outrages about it it is because -money.
i don t even care what race she is  i just miss the long braid  the booba  the shorts  the dual pistols  and the quick witted attitude she used to have.
big lips are not generally associated with british aristocracy.  some germans are characterized in ww2 propaganda films as having the big lips.  see the nazis of american ww2 era cartoons.  brits are animated with a stiff upper lip and non existent bottom lip.  we did our family trees during an olympic year.  lara croft fits the german physique of one region where they re pretty much light skinned west african which is similar around the mediterranean sea.  weird but east africa is more like northern german physique of thin and efficient build that goes clear to ireland.  lara croft sounds german to me. that doesn t sound like an english originated name.  the gutteral oughfff in the middle screams germany or possibly japan.  which would open up more ancestral story arcs. kroft lara kroft in ww1 works.
you should play tomb raider custom levels.
imagine a world where you as an artist can t even create ideas for different versions of your character without people picking out one of your designs and trains of thought  trying to call out that they used to be this race.no  the character had a chance to be that race like any other idea the artist had. this wasn t finalised and the original creators has every right to change their characters.its like if someone pointed out that black panther used to be a british hero who was white during the concept art phase for the character. do you know how ridiculous that sounds lol
as soon as she said naughty dog i was done. there s something going on there i d rather avoid.for anyone gaming in 1999  they might remember another eidos title - urban chaos featuring a black female cop . . . .
lara does not need to be anything but pixelated  i m okay it shes reduced to a cube
murtaugh from leathal weapon was originally conceived as a white dude.. then they went with danny glover. that original ideal would not be a reason to change murtaugh to a white guy.same with lara. no reason to change her or even incorporate elements from the early phases before they solidified the character
i love ur lara croft tattoo dude
in the first stages of development a lot changesi would pay more attention if this had made it to lore or even graphicsno doubt this will destroy yet another character now as the left really don t need an excuse to destroy great workhow long before she is a  strong gay woman of colour  now beyond predictable at this pointno she wasn t  race swapped she went through development like every other character in gaming but i m sure our rainbow overlords will get round to itafter editing the children s books!she was ground-breaking at the timeas someone old enough to see it all in real time she was tough like batman went on adventures like indiana jonesand was also driven and still feminineyou know what was best thoughshe wasn t recycled!!!!!!she was a new character for a new agehollyweird and the woke could learn much from herand we are all different as a  white  guy that has spent my life being asked  where are you from we need to stop it with the boxes!!and bother to notice the human pressed into that boxnote the quality of the person and not profile on the groupbest wishes and much love to all
well the reason for samus not getting credit is because companies lovveeee to look at money. metroid didn t sell anywhere even close to what tomb raider made. before tomb raider  female lead games like metroid could only make around 1-3 million units sold  tomb raider came out and fucking broke all kinds of records proving that female lead games can sell. but it would seem even though a lot of games have female leads  none of them will be able to reach tomb raider status. tomb raider has been the best selling video game franchise with a female lead since the 90 s. she s held the record for well over like 23  years lol.
bowser king of the koopas was originally designed to be an ox. he still an ox
white people aren t allowed write characters of other races! meanwhile people of other races are allowed write white characters.  those characters are often gross and racist.being a member of the x generation  this what we were told was bad and wrong and not to be bigoted and racist in this way.  and yet  here we are.  how did racism and bigotry get so popular on our watch when we were specifically told not to do this
well then... make a character creator     of a new croft family member... something
what  race  is the name  cruz   it s a spanish surname. that is  it s a white name. ted cruz is a white guy  in case anyone is unclear on that point.that aside  it s annoying that the left gets its panties twisted so badly about  race swapping  in the  very rare  instances where a white character is cast in a non-white role  but thinks that it is just absolutely marvelous to race-swap non-whites into white roles. the rules they want for themselves are basically the opposite of the rules they want for other people.
i m surprised they care considering 97  of latinos in america hate woke ideology.melonie  you should get an ancestry dna mapping. my family has been saying we had native ancestors my whole life which i always questioned. sure enough  we are 80  german  20  polish.
so funny that some people lose their little minds over characters being redesigned during development on twitter lol! example resident evil 2 elza walker was redesigned into claire redfield  this happens all the time in game development but these idiots have a very low resolution view of the world.
there are millions of white south americans. also  there are millions of white europeans with dark tans because they spend their summers at the beach  especially in southern europe where it s sunny for most of the year. americans don t seem to know much about the world.
you guys remember the controversy around the game sifu  a martial arts game with asian characters made by a french studio that was accused of  cultural appropriation .yeah...
not upset by this   it is interesting.  kinda wish they could do something with it  just a different thing.  they re is a shortage of latina and latino video game player characters  i could be wrong  if the  woke folks  want good diversity and representation   a new original character within the video game instead of changing things tho  a british latina could be interesting too english explorer falls in love with latin american guide on an expedition   could be interesting
some latinos do have black ancestry  puerto ricans  cubans and dominicans are an example of how a mix race can look nothing like their ancestors yet the only way they know of their ancestry is via their culture. puerto rican spanish has african and native american words in it  their music  dances and cooking is also mixed by all 3 cultures. so saying that a latina isn t afro is not quite correct as many latinos don t even look like they had black great grandparents or a black father. hell when people see my father they are like wtf  but how   my father is black but i m not as my mother is light brown skinned  yet her grandfather was black. anyways some latinos can come out with all sorts of features due to the mixing of races but yes she can be afro latina  not in a sense that she has black parents or grandparents but in a sense that it is possible for a latina to have african ancestry  thus latina or afro latina is all the same  but it all depends what kind of latina she is from because one from mexico and other parts of south america don t have african ancestry.
this is coming up cause of the april o neil talk.
why do americans think latinos s aren t white argentina are latino. they re also hispanic.  they re also 90  italian immigrants. brazilians are latino but not hispanic.  latino is an ethnicity  not a race.latins derived from the dominant tribe that gave rise to the roman empire which later became italy. hispanic derives from hispania  now known as spain . latina today derives from cultures that were influenced from them.  they could ve made her latina but could ve been white  black or mixed.
great presentation meloniemac
plus   not a fan of the 2013 tomb raider games  reminds me of jennifer lawrence in hunger games....not interesting at all
the creator sounds like a massive progressive beta---anyone can make a woman a heroine it was the woman who actualized the character
off topic  i used to follow you on every platform you were on. youtube  twitter  twitch. i enjoyed your speaking out against cancel culture  and just about every topic you brought up i supported. i really enjoyed your scriptures because they were uplifting. but then  something felt different. i m a sinner  we re all sinners to some extent. some much more serious than others. i guess it just got to a point where it felt less like you were all about encouragement and doing right by others to more of a lambasting and judging. what prompted me to say this now. today s quote tweet about going to hell. it bothers me deeply. i was once told this by a complete stranger where i used to work. it s a very personal thing to tell someone. does that guy know me  do you  i ve made plenty of mistakes. but we can t say that god forgives us but in the next breath that we re going to hell anyway. it s been a long time since i read the bible  but i am a christian. i pray for others  i pray that i learn from my mistakes  and i ask for forgiveness. i suppose i wanted to clear the air. i m sure a few will have something to say. i don t care. i do respect you for your thoughts on matters  i m a fellow christian  albeit very flawed   and you re a breath of fresh air in a world where we can t say anything that goes against the grain of group-think. i guess i just feel like with that tweet that i feel like suddenly i ll be a human torch regardless  and i m not sure what to think if that s how you feel. i could be misunderstanding the context of it. .
great video tomb raider
she may still be latina... she was just born in britain. her ethnicity would not change. if she was born in britain that would explain her accent. anyway  this could open the door for a lot more mystery about her background if anything.
tobey tobey tobey guard...  left because lara was  sexualised   and came back to give her the skimpy nightdress and a bunch of bikini for the first time! yeeeaah!
in my opinion  whiteness is just not suiting lara croft. i do think she can stay british though but mixed with latina or other non white group  maybe her rich father or mother married brown idk.it could be the excuse for her toughness and for the fact that she hated the life her parents wanted for her  cause she always felt different from the others.  which is the story of so much children these days it could be so much better if she was a brown woman fighting white men. it could give so much more depths to her.i am not appreciate the fact that tr community is fighting so hard from preventing lara from being less white.seems like core knew what they are doing when they changed her to be british  they knew their audience racist.and the funny thing is they are always saying  she is white cause she is british  while there are a lot of non white people in england - british doesn t mean white and you are just ignorant or racist.@melonie mac go boomso why is it so important to you that lara will be white
audiences weren t ready  salma hayek anyone  i can tell you as a young impressionable dorky teenager  audiences were more than ready for her.
wow i never knew that. i learned something new today
likely mentally preconditioning us to accept a future race swap in a movie or game.
who s looking good today   who s looking good in every way   no style  rookie!  best watch you don t mess with me!
she was inspired by neneh cherry  a danish woman
collared   very british way of saying  caught
but also if she was a sexy latina then we would never hear the end of  they re fetishizing our women!!!
i always wondered why her skin was so tanned.
oh my god when will it end
odd how source material is so important all of a sudden. and i thought it was a fictional character so anything goes. right
this will be the excuse if she get race swap on the amazon show or whatever they are doing.
that was just a concept  what is released is cannon.
and that s your lecture for croft studies 304. quiz on friday.
.... now i wanna listen to  buffalo stance   lol
i understand where you re coming from. i m in the same boat myself a bit in regards to having stepped away from my beliefs some several years back  but i don t think i ever truly stopped believing. this year  i decided i wanted to read the bible in earnest  mostly to have context for all the bible quotes i would see and hear while perusing the internet. fun fact  did you know that moses wasn t much of a public speaker  god directed him to get his brother  aaron to speak for him  just as god asked moses to be his speaker.     the reason i mention that is simply because we all have something we fall short at in some way  whether it be anger  or drugs  or a simple inability to communicate well with others. god meets us on his terms as much as our own  in the hopes that we can better bridge the gap in our relationship with him. i don t focus on any particular denomination or their teachings. the only thing that one really needs to understand is to read the bible and know history to have a more contextualized understanding of what is written.     i hope that whatever you may be going through  no matter the struggle or circumstance  you ll find time to sit and read the bible again. it may shine light on what bothers you  it may not  but if nothing else  it will help to understand where others are coming from when they speak of the hellfire and damnation approach to spreading the messages and teachings of the bible.     p.s. sorry this was so long. i don t normally comment  but i read yours and felt that i might be able to share something helpful. i hope this finds you in good tidings.
@the detailed devil  thanks. i appreciate the insight and the input. i went to a lutheran school as a kid. i m a pretty rusty on stuff  and like i said  i ve made my share of mistakes  but i m inclined to say that i m not hell material. whoever it was she retweeted really should check himself and ask himself if he s worthy of judging others.thank you again!
@mike c  no problem. we all got to figure out our own path in the end  but it never hurts to help each other out when we might be able to. stay well.
the constand background changing is annoying though.
@blackcroft666lp  totally agree
i thought she was swedish but i could be wrong.
lara croft is british....not latino! otherwise she s just another character with lara crofts name and not the actual character
i like neneh cherry but she s not part latina. she s sierra leonean and swedish
she was not african in the og dev cycle. she was spanish.
i m not entirely sure why this post even exists. it s just another example of someone on twitter cherry picking information for people to misconstrue into an issue bigger than it needs to be.
i m suspicious of anyone who s into german shepherds.
neneh cherry 7 seconds.
the world  finally  some good thing. modern  western  not anymore.
gotta make it about race lol.
tank girl is wild lol
they find a reason for anything melanie
nehney cherry picking or lori petty picking
they changed her last minute..... so she wasn t race swapped  if the character never appeared as  afro latina  then that s not a race swap
that s cool actually i m all for a lara cruz that s hot hahaha
she looks puerto rican in those cartoons
not buying a word of this. seriously americans can t figure out the name laura   or lara   that s just a fail right there.  second yes nenah cherry was quite popular and all over mtv for a while in the late 80s but i m quite sure if i recall lara was supposed to be somewhat based on a super model from the era. i m sure someone recalls who. it does help to have been alive through this time and that guy doesn t look old enough to me.
5 16 __ i know some white people wit some huge lips  needs to be a song or rap ...somebody anybody pleeeease
didn t they try to make lara asian  i believe it was an update for the first rebooted tomb raider game.
these people are desperate  anything done in preproduction is just conceptual until final approval.then it s becomes the official version.
i think this was made up as there is no real documentation about it  so they can say pretty much what they want
soooooo.  lara croft  was never mexican.
who doesn t know lara cruz with her wipe.
lara is so fine
i m pretty sure there s this actress that s white and has really big lips what s her name again.....oh angelina jolie that s it and didn t she play a character from a video game damn who was it.....oh it was lara croft man that s weird huh
south african and i think this is plain insane ot them to do that. in fact we south african gamers know that lara croft as always been white. we loved lara because she was an amazing well written  gal.  this is just plain pathetic of these developers.
so glad they changed the name lara croft sounds way cooler
first game i played she was british and full figured red hair reddish brown maybe
i heard lara was supposed to laura cruz
hey  melonie i just wanted to say that if any of my friends wants to know bout lara croft and tomb raider video games series that i will tell them to follow you on your twitter account   instagram account and your melonie mac go boom channel account to see what you can tell them about lara croft and tomb raider video games series  ok melonie. anyway also we as gamers should not care about what race lara croft is or was that we should still love   respect   admire and support lara croft as what she is to us and what she is to us is our favorite classic video game character ever  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to make a comment on this video for today and i just wanted to let you know that i do appreciate your hard work that you do to make these videos for us to watch and make a comment to you on what we think bout this videos that you make for us everyday  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great day and great evening at home and have a good nite too at home melonie. god bless you and god bless your hard work that you do to make these great videos for us your fans melonie. anyway have a great day and enjoy your evening melonie.
i m not surprised that she wasn t originally designed as british. i ve always assumed that she was mixed race of some sort  mostly because of her skin tone  to be honest.
to call it a swap  i d say the character would have needed to be established and out in the public eye and recognizable.changing names  color pallets and origins pre release is just standard development.this is just pandering.nothing to see here.
these weren t an issue back in the days  and i just hope that this history won t make us feel guilty and accept race swapping characters in the future.
beautiful video
she ll soon be played by moses ingram. yeahhhhhh.
melonie i am sorry that angry joe went after you he isn t that bright
their argument about her race in development makes no sense what so ever. neneh cherry was born in sweden. and moved to england she wasn t latina
neo from the matrix supposed to be played by will smith. i quess neo is also white washed.
how was she race swapped if she was always a white british woman ever since the first game was released  if this is the new location of the goal post  then that means there s a crapload of stuff that s been race swapped from white to something else.
even if they started with laura cruz sp    what hit store shelves was lara croft. that is what the public first saw and what we ve had for about 25 years. that s not how a race-swap works. lara croft is a white british woman and that s that.
well  what do you expect from somone who s currently working at naughty dog right
they race swapped the hulk from a black guy to a green guy...
haha all good  he was wrong and i m not gonna give him the attention he wants over it
dang. i thought he was cool.
audiences weren t ready for what  it s like saying the world wasn t ready for actors like samuel l. jackson  denzel washington  morgan freeman or wesley snipes. and they want to tell me that  the audience wasn t ready   this is one major league bs right here. some people will do anything just to have their  5 minutes  of  fame .
guess this how there going to change her forever your probably not going the original one for a long time
did my comment about recommending a fanedit of lara croft here got erased   i thought you re against censorship.
2001  angelina jolie british... the conversation is over. they hand picked her for the job. it doesn t matter what anyone else was thinking on release day. this is what happened and the end result of lara croft s character. race swapping her now is wokism.
.i. modern gaming!!!!here s proof again!!
they did this to hermoinie in harry potter  too. people should just want good products. who cares if their race swapped.
does anyone know what the outro music is called
naughty dog lol. of course.
why is this even a big thing she always looked spanish or italian to me so her being latina doesnt really matter its why i thought it was a no brainer as to why they got angelina jolie and then alicia vikander because they had the tanned skin she has. contray to what people actually think about us brits we actually are not all pale white ghost there are brits with tanned  there are irish  scottish  english and cornish with tanned skin and has been since the ye ol days of the bronze age most likely to do with the italian mix and gauls having spanish in them. so her having tanned skin isnt a big deal just keep her the way she was in the original games before the shitty reboot series and why make not just make a brand new character that is black or brown and be creative and have a brand new character with brand new stories instead of race swapping an already established character. tomb raider is pretty much a dead series at this point anyway the last good games were was underworld and legends the series died with the reboots. the new games other than her using a bow which is always good to see more in games because they are much better stealthier killing weapons than guns are because guns even with silencers make far too much noise contray to what movies and games like metal gear liked to portray and having some cool crafting mechanics and the best thing in the game was the hunting stuff i spent more time on that because i had no interest in the story it was just lara looking for daddy again and uncovering what daddy was researching before he vanished again we have seen that in the old games and the angelina jolie movies. the games and story sucked especially how they changed lara from the most bad ass female game character ever who back flips over dinosaurs and shoots them from above dual wielding deseart eagles and does cartwheels over spiked traps and kills aliens  gods and what not to a boring card board cut out character who spends more time crying and whining and falling off things than she actually does fighting and doing actual acrobatics and i completed the new tomb raider wasnt a fan of it and i paid no attention to the story i was bored to death and rise of tomb raider i got through 1 hour and was bored so i just put in tomb raider legends and played that and played as the real lara croft if they just gave real lara croft a crossbow or a compound bow in a game and had her facing off against dinosaurs  aliens and monsters i would be happy. the whole this is a realistic down to earth take on tomb raider was pointless and boring and not what anyone wanted and didnt work if you ask me and even in the new tomb raider she had quite tanned skin for a british woman so who cares. quite frankly lara croft is lara croft no matter what you make her look like because the colour of her skin isnt what makes her who she is  its her personality  her bad ass skills and acrobats and archeology so as long as you keep  that who cares.
when will they stop with this nonsense it s ridiculous. if they want to go there  what about nick fury from marvel comics
she was going to be a man at first  and they were thinking of copyright and changed him to her. they changed her to be more british.
she s supposed to be half spanish british  not new world  latino .
i don t get how they don t see their own racism when it comes to race swapping but no they celebrate it and forget about originality.
according to the woke mob  no character was ever white lol
wait  lara was a man at one point in development! she can be a trans icon now!
people are also saying april o neal was originally black...no she wasn t.
lara croft is english and descended from aristocracy which is how she can afford all her trips. so what do you think  white or based on a one hit wonder 80 s faux rap artist from the 80 s
same as the bs claims that april o neil was originally black in the comics.
neat!
shhhh! you ll offend the...shit i know this...
kwasade for the algorithm.
he physical appearance is the same.she looks like latina but with slightly lighter skin. not all spanish people have darker skin especially we puerto ricans and mexicans.people be crazy.
i thought they changed her to a woman because there were too many similarities to indiana jones
happy women s day to you beautiful and attractive and gorgeous woman
as a youngster i had inappropriate thoughts about natla .
they re crying about a scrapped concept now ...
lara croft has been rebooted and changed so much it doesn t matter anymore. og lara is dead.
why not just say her mother was latina.
what if she was latin british
but in the 90 s this was never a problem... back then gameplay and story was what matter. in fact that models who been hired as a face of lara in many ocasions like e3 and others was rarely a white chicks. but this comment from naughty dog don t shock me a bit
we getting at changes in the conept stage now  smh. well how about this. mortal kombat was originally going to have seven male characters. an executive producer wanted a woman to be featured in the game. they did not have enough power in the tech to simply add her to the roster  so they took out black male character jax briggs and replaced him with white woman sonya blade
woke mob outraged by this but also want james bond race swapped and every other character going.
so much for the  race skin color doesn t matter  shit

this is kinda pointless news since croft is what was introduced to us..
she can t be latina anymore  i knew that she was laura cruz at some point and that s also one of the reasons my spaniard friends liked her a lot.
i like how woke twitter will say  make her what her original concept was!  but then go  nick fury  kang  joel s daughter in last of us  corlys velaryon in house of the dragon  were originally white characters  but f it  leave them how they are now!
if the opinion comes from someone at naughty dog  chances are it s a really stupid one.
fine  make her black  or brown  or whatever. would that help though in making a good game or movie again
that twitter post was just some sjw bullshit. they re just trying to stir shit up. i know with your history and love of tomb raider you had to set the record straight.
starring lars croft then. the first concept was a white man.
@blackcroft666lp  i m good  we got indiana jones already
croft rolls off the tongue better. this coming from a puerto rican.
who cares  make her latina  make her black  make her asian  i don t care.just give me an open world map filled with caves and tombs to explore and solve puzzles  secret treasures  good story and of course dual pistols to shoot enemies.how hard is that
lora cruz  amigos
woke w@nker on karin energy
leave it to someone at naughty dog to be a disingenuous gonk
sorry  but stuff that was left on the cutting room floor or scrapped during pre-production isn t canon. you ll be hearing more about the  whitewashing  of lara croft when new tomb raider projects are in the works in an attempt to influence the creative direction. video game publishers and movie studio executives are rubbing their hands together at the thought of race swapping lara croft to receive woke points.
i honestly hate naughty dog more and more as time goes on
whites arys are not mixed and the english lara croft is a like a brand new series.
a strong latina lara croft will be better than alicia vikander lol
have the squawkers ever seen people from venezuela or for that matter parts of spain some are white as rice.  although more in venezuela can get like that if the sun bleached their bones. okay back to britain. some citizens there happen to be mixed ancestry from africa  the middle east  india oh heck let s just say most of the tropics around the world. oh anyone remember british honduras  just saying.
lara craft was never lara cruz  the body model was white  the game charecture has always white. what a charectures name was before the game was made is meaningless. luke skywalker is not starkiller his first name. in the draft.
ok the race swap thing has gone too far it needs to stop
wait until the wokenet finds out laura croft was supposed to be a man. and based on indiana jones. i bet the  trans community  will love that.  yes this is sarcasm
i didn t know that
angry joe thinks hes fat joe. needs to just pull up his pants and do the rock away and lean back
it was changed before the release so who cares.
we was kangzzzz!!!!!!
melonie raider
if people are triggered by this...they really need to get a life.
see greek and italian women.
why  we know the raider was british.
she was race swapped. cool with it and it is old news   like 25yrs ago
the willful ignorance of people today
so darken her skin and make her curvy like a latina without actually making her a latina  nah  not cool. leave her as is. basically you re saying it s cool to raceswap her body but not her origin. super tone deaf given the history around that one.
love you
melonieits the april o new race swap is like if hollywood made a red dead redemption movie and john marston  was played by a fat black comedian who is funny cedric the entertainer you don t do that
and the white brit was a better choice and has been proven by it s success. a latina isn t exactly orginal  michelle rodriguez is good playing those parts though
until the character is released there is no race swap. if she was latina in the first game  then yes i d call it a race swap  but this  cherrypicking and grasping at straws sorry
nice try melonie mac  but your encyclopedic knowledge of tomb raider is no match for my desire for other people to be racist!
sounds like doctor who. sydney newman didn t create anything. verity lambert  a woman launched the show.
no dude that white woke guy can write black characters because he has a black friend.a dark black friend  no
she was originally a man !!!but they changed the game bc it was too close to indiana jones.
looks like a red head latina. aka she is a mix of white and some kind of latin.why not make her white and latina now  she would literally look the same.
race swap is so stupid  as a black guy i promise you we don t care if we aren t in a video game its literally fine  unless it has character creation with no dark skin and we don t care if we aren t in movies or tv shows  all we care if its good or notan already established character cant change race or gender  its stupid and don t make any sense a character should be what they are already officially established
first world problems
they should reboot the series and gender swap to a man.   larrycroft
afro-latina     neneh cherry is from swedenmother from sweden father from west africatalking about  cherry-picking ..........pick the appropriate information.
i call it bullshit. no one had problems with carmen sandiego games back in the 90s
people know latinas can still be white right
god just imagine that. lara cruz. we didn t need a rosie parez game hero. i m glad they changed her.  that s all they do nowadays to all pretty white characters. so good. let them cry.
she will be black next
wait  she s a gamer girl and she s religious  omegealulz
sooo basically the official first time release of lara croft was a white britsh woman. so yeah she s officially white. that latina thing was only during development. so it mean absolutely nothing. if she was latina in the first game and then changed to a white woman  then this would be race swap. the character could have been a man in dev and then a woman at release but this character is define when the game is officially released not before.
melonie talking lara croft again ! girl this   topic is boring.

white and latino are the same by race and dna makeup but for black latinos.there are only 4 racial groups caucasion negro asian and aboriginal
this is a comment.
no  lara croft is a black trans man. these people are so wrong.
not much difference genetically and aesthetically between a latin and a spaniard so not sure their would be racism. unless you are saying americans are racism against spaniards.
another woke writer trying to create a narrative and rewrite the past just to virtue signal.
maybe a lot of white people are mixed in murica but in europe we aren t and lara is english.when tomb raider came out there wasn t this murican rubbish of cultural appropriation  especially in england.it is weird that an english studio would talk about latinos when making a game and not real spanish.
i m first!
only a problem when whitey does it lol.
i am done with this crap. race-swapped shit. just let them suffer the consequences like the rings of power. as a tomb raider fan black person  just let them do whatever they want.
all of this is just extremely stupid. nobody cared about this before  and nobody will after. shes lara croft  british tomb raider. her race is set in stone and bringing this all up is just to get clicks off naive black people. sadly it worked..
back then  i thought she was a black woman because of the skin tone they gave her in the early games. i also didn t care at all about the skin tone as it was the damn tank controls that used to annoy me.
do you want tongo out with me
this video is interesting. however i don t particularly care about this at this point in time. sorry. i m over most of this woke racial overemphasis by now.
not in the mind of a twitter user lol
people forget the root word is  latin  which covers so much of europe.
false.
almost!
awful. another race swap for a terrible version.
we wuz vidyagaem characterz n shiet
alicia vikander looks more latina than white british. it was never an issue  other than angelina jolie fit the video game profile better yet she doesn t look british at all.
boooo!
ur channel is great but i hate the phrase  british laura croft . there s really no such thing as british.  england scotland and wales are very different.  she s the london laura croft. americans think london represents the whole of  the island of the uk
omfg who cares  lara was originally a man at the start of the project. are we to start bitching about how she was gender swapped from a man
no we don t. who said that it does
clearly you didn t watch my video before throwing your tantrum there
@melonie mac go boom  no melonie  i watched the whole damned thing. i always watch the whole video. i m more than a little annoy at you for boxing me in without considering that possibility. you make soem great insights and points. every character goes through evolutionary changes. you should check out the designs for kratos before they settled on our favorite bald tattood spartan. you could even do an enitre video on a lot of that stuff. it s fascinating.now tell me i m wrong though  what does it matter that she was race swapped at any point during early developent. it s not relevant.  so my  tantrum  which was more towards the first 34s of your video and conclude at the 49s mark. she is what she is now.
