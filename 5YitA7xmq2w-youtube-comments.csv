i think velma has done the impossible   it has brought americans on the right and the left together in a mutual hatred.
velma would never laugh at someone confessing their love. velma is someone you would copy the math homework of  not someone who would copy your math homework.this is not a spinoff  this is a tumblr fanfic wearing the skinsuit of a beloved cultural property  and even the skinsuit is race-swapped.
velma speaks a lot about what type of person mindy kaling is.
from the dude that came up with the plans and made the traps  to a guy that can t even use a knife...they did fred so dirty man.
scooby-do was one on my favorite cartoons when i was a child. sad to hear the characters were changed for a  modern audience  .
isn t the court scene where velma for no reason humiliates fred after wrongly accusing him for murder literally the same shit she-hulk pulled  the humiliating part i mean
i took the kids to see puss and boots it was good. and what was  funny and great is that dogs dream is to be a service dog and comfort people even dow he had a horrible life and is still filled with love and positivity. when he saw his friend was in distress he grew instantly worried not sure what to do stoped for a second then did what a service dog does. it was a great scene and portrayed the service dog image perfectly.
if they wanted to make an adult comedy spin off of scooby doo  they could ve done a better job. they could ve made a separate  hopeless team that competes against mystery inc for business  but they just suck at it. instead they took wholesome characters who were good people and made them into horrible people. what they did to fred was unforgivable. fred was supposed to be the epitome of a man that every woman wanted and every man wanted to be.
this is such a perversion of a beloved franchies and one of my favorit childhood shows it makes me so sad and angry at the same time.jrr tolkien was so right  evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin good forces have invented or made
they actually made velma a psychopath. shaggy confesses his love for her while she is having a panic attack  and she laughs and mocks him   -  wow.
i can t get past the panic attack bit. puss in boots def did it so accurately. i talked my sister into going to see it with my nieces btw because of you saying it was so good.
even my girlfriend  who always keeps an open mind decided to take a chance at this show  couldn t even sit through all of the first episode. i would ve stopped at the first 5 min  needless to say  to forget about the whole thing  we decided to watch scooby doo meets courage the cowardly dog afterwards and we had a much better time lol.
i love how melonie s cat saw that she was about to go on a rant and got the heck out of there.
one of  the worst things about this is how did daphne feel comfortable having any sexaul relationship with velma when she litterly hit her in the head with a stick. she was litterly assaulted by this girl in the locker room with a weapon. why is it when they want to write characters as lesbiens there always  abusive it happened in korra and now here.
the creepiest part of this show is the fact that they all are in fact teenagers in highschool minors and yet there are several moments where they sexualized them and put them in questionable conversatons  situations. like who was this for  even if the show was not a total fuck you to the fans of the original series or to our childhoods that shit is still creepy af
i know i ve heard people mention before over the years but i ve never understood it  why did so many people start claiming velma was gay again  especially gay for daphne  i never got why that was a thing. at first i was under the impression she was into fred too but over the years it seemed like she started looking into dating other people and in one of the more recent shows she seemed to have a thing for shaggy. tbh velma s love life has always been a bit of a mess imo but that was never the thing that stood out about her. the most notable thing about her is that she s always been the smartest person in her friend group however she has her own weaknesses too  she was smart but she wasn t a know it all. everyone in her friend group has their place  as mentioned velma was the smart one who figured out the mysteries  fred was the leader of the group and the trap guy  daphne was at one point useless but over the years she grew as a character and gained her own agency and shaggy and scooby were both the comic relief and the heart of the group. they all have their own flaws and they cover for each other because they re friends and care about each other. in the expensive fanfiction that they created  velma  the group are not only incredibly unlikable but they re also a bunch of jerks to each other  so why in the hell would these people ever become friends and solve mysteries together  they d sooner kill each other before the crazy costume wearing lunatics get a chance to.
2 40   scooby doo was about  uncovering who monster was  and in this case  the monster was hbo max... . that s some good script writing and would love to see that meme.
i ve been saying the same thing about puss in boots the last wish. that movie naild it so well  i watched it twice already. compared to the piles of feces that came out the past year  puss in boots is one of the best movies ever. this velma show  not even pirated sites get it uploaded  big shoutout to the directors of puss in boots and the recently released the last of us!
networks are willing to spend so much money to troll people. if that s not proof of an agenda  producing content that almost surely won t turn a profit   i don t know what is.
i haven t seen scooby-doo in a long while. but when i was a kid in the early 90s i would always watch it when i was sick or when i wasn t in school at my grandparents house. good times.
an alliance forged in hatred is a fragile thing at best.
last time i remember that level of unity was when osama decided to f around and find out.
even more. scrappy doo is no longer the most hated character in the franchise. velma is. now that is achieving the impossible!
not only americans but jamaicans      also
@davidwcooney  i  actually never had a problem with scrappy.
i agree
i recommend binge watching scooby doo mystery inc  with some of the hbo version of herge s tintin thrown in.
you re doing the lords work velma
more like the skinsuit of a bad cosplayer.
just wanted to comment the same  i mean the last line....
stop making stuff up
@smurfie8412  making what up
velma wasnt laughing at his feelings  she already friendzone him and she thought that he already knew  so for her  it was a simple joke
they essentially took the skinsuit  threw it in the trash and then stole the clothes to masquerade around in.
@redscul129  the fact she frinedzoned him doesnt make him stop loving her that instant. if she knew he was into her and still is  it was not a simple joke. it was garbage human being behaviour.
@burgermeistermeisterburgrr
i agree.  i m a leftist  but when i watch reviews of this trash fire on right wing channels  i largely agree with them.  the race swapping doesn t bother me as much as other aspects of the show  however  although i still view it as tokenism and political correctness gone haywire.  the clumsy attempts at metanarrative and subversion of characters are far worse than any race swapping could ever be.   such things can be done right  but in contemporary popular culture  they seldom are.   if i had an hbo max subscription  i might be tempted to watch this out of morbid curiosity  but the clips i ve seen are sufficient to show me that this series takes badness to a new level.  this show might turn out to be an anti-masterpiece that will be remembered for a long time as one of the worst tv shows ever made.  i suppose it might be so bad that it is funny  but it looks to me like it is too bad even for that  which is impressive.  i think they should top it off by adding scrappy doo to the cast and making him even more annoying than the original version.  i ll follow the reviews as more episodes drop.  this will be an entertaining situation to observe.  it would be nice if hollywood finally learns something from this  but i m not holding my breath.  only bad writers are welcome in hollywood these days  and no new ideas are allowed.
i thought the flash was the impossible
@davidwcooney  do you mean fake-velma  cause velma is still very liked  still  liked  by rule-34 and still shipped with johnny bravo and the new girl  sometimes the three are shipped together and sometimes the three are shipped together in rule 34  but you get what i meant
@davidwcooney  i wanna go back to when scrappy was the worst character  those were good times
@davidwcooney  velma the shit show not the character
@redman836   to be united by hatred is a fragile alliance at best  - kreia.
so they have a black woman portraying the dog   is that what i understand  isn t that degrading toward black woman
@davidwcooney  i never understood the dislike that scrappy got as a child i was pretty much just confused that there was a mini scoob xd
not just america... it brought the internet together!
it brought the intier internet together  the internet that gets mad at people for no reason.
@redman836  i see you.
don t know why  this is a personification of the left wing
actually now the left is blaming the right for this monstrosity
@technologycansuchit8156  ahh  the hope of some unity once again fades.  back to praying for revival.
@technologycansuchit8156  some of them  but the way mindy kaling has stood by it kind of debunks that theory
i see a nobel peace prize..... no wait kaling hasn t ordered any drone strikes.
i think not only american but the whole world
@technologycansuchit8156  are they sped  when does the right ever talk about kids aside from what goes on in the virgin islands that the left ignores but goes nuts on tate which i think the media is a little too crazy about
yep  it did the rarest thing possible  unite the critics and the audience to turn on this show entirely! that s just very rare for woke media critics and audiences to be on the same page finally for once!
@user-wm9wk9oe5i  i remember that day  i was in des moines iowa at the time passing through visiting a friend and they re literally people partying in the streets with american flags and everybody was hugging everybody. it was a really beautiful moment seeing people inunity.
@themagus9860  i know a lot of people enjoyed scrappy-doo  i personally kind of got annoyed with him after a while he was nice and like small doses  but having them in the show for too long just felt like a chore. mind you that s only my opinion versus millions of people out there who watch a show.
@davidwcooney  what s even more crazy is a couple years ago they did like a pole or they asked fans who they felt their favorite character was and to everybody surprise velma was number one. which is downright sad because this new velma show is just shiting on velma as well as everything that scooby-doo stood for. it was meant to be for kids as well as for everybody so it was meant to be something that was fun for everyone and not just a joke and a parody of what it used to be. and for those saying that this was meant for adults  they could have gone about it and done it right and made it for adults without embarrassing what made scooby-doo great. perfect example that new wednesday show that came out was a darker version of the addams family and it did well. i personally didn t watch it but i believe sabrina the teenage witch did the same thing. so the fact is it can be done if it s done right  the sad thing is is velma was done by a bunch of woke people who don t care about good characters  and good storylines.
true words!
@redman836  is that a quote from a book or movie
this whole situation reminds me of the end of watchmen.
what if it was meant to
@haterator  but she didnt
@haterator  a woman cant just not know
we wuz dogs n shieet mang
da you re alive !
@haterator  now that i read your name  i know you just wanna fight  velma just didnt know  but there are other things to hate  i dont hate the series  but theres so many negatives that im not oging to defend it
velma would never do these things  but mindy kaling would. this is kaling cosplaying as velma in order to  act out  her personal frustrations. this also explains the major changes to all other characters  because this is how she  kaling  sees the world or wants the world to be  all men are pathetic beta cucks  all women are amazeballs  even if they are teen drugdealers.
@cwcpants140  well  velma accepted that she is always judging people and by that seeing the worst every time  so  yeah you are right
@tjroelsma5906  well.. velma always had one personality  a researcher  but  with how the world is today  she would be a little bit judgy  but not such an a..hole  like in this series
it s so bad they body shamed fred s genitals when guys have committed suicide in the past over their sexual anxieties and self worth   these writers seem pure evil
@redscul129  why did you people watch this
@charlieberry7562  lol is fred 15 too
yeah it s not scooby-doo
@charlieberry7562  well  i cant make people try to understand or defend stuff from this series  theres many angles to hate it since we are living in a soft culture so... im out
@dennisthemenace567  is just 2 chapters and i dont hate the series  but i wont keep watching
except that sometimes tumblr fanfics are objectively good. this thing is bad always
@dennisthemenace567  yes. he s 15 or 16 which makes the whole  fred s body hasn t fully matured yet  jokes  make no sense considering the fact that s actually normal at that age
looks like mindy cosplaying velma in animated form.  i ve seen media produced in a vat of narcissism before but she s taken it to a whole new level.
heck i ve seen tribute of velma on fanfic that not come even close to this mindy kaling abomination.
@redram6080  it makes them not jokes
@dennisthemenace567  exactly
666 likes
@ariwhitepaw3738  fixed it!
i know right  am i the only one who imagines this velma as mindy kaling animated in a velma costume
i completely forgot she was even the one behind this.  shows just how great she is.
facts
bingo  biggest self insert ever
she just wrote it as herself in a velma costume
@batman0  wut
she s intent on becoming the new face of narcissism
kaling was raised in the rich part of cambridge  massachusetts  graduated dartmouth  ivy league college   and went straight to work in a coveted job in hollywood. hasn t had a day of deprivation or struggle in her life  but she s this bitter   did she think she deserves more   to quote will munny    deserve s got nothin  to do with it.
can t have competent man in today s world
apparently fred s character has a lot of fans  so who s this show even for
@megaknight2012  insanity
bro shaggy is the one who s actually rich. funny how they couldn t even get that right
who is this  modern audience   where is it  like seriously who are these people trying to appeal to
same here  manny silva and crimzon nova
sad to hear they did that just for most of the modern audience response is to say  aaaaahhhhhh turn it back
don t worry even the  modern audience  hates these versions of the characters as much as us og fans so we can all come together in our collective hate of the monstrosity of a show.
t h e  m e s s a g e
keep coping!
@smurfie8412  i think we found the one velma fan. what s your pronouns
@smurfie8412  who are you and who let you back in the house
@crimzonnova5368  anybody but the og fans. cuz they know if they try this s    back in the day lynch mob and beatdown for not staying true to the character but disrespectful to the fans
not worthy of wasting time on
i think she wrote them as raving lunatics like the characters in the mindy project.then some of her co-writers by some inexplicable stupidity thought they were like normal people and made the show use them to represent normal society.the plot is still over the top  the show not just thinks this is normal teenager stuff somehow.
let s get one thing clear if the scoobi  thing happens you think the backlash is bad right now just wait if this happens you ll see a social media shit storm the likes of which we ve not seen in years !
@falconlibrary  facts
hell no this isn t from fans of scooby-doo!! the mystery inc toon was from genuine scooby-doo fans. the youtube live-action series is from scooby-doo fans... this is an abomination.
@charlieberry7562  while i agree with you charlie  do you have any other thoughts or are you just going to paste the same thing in every thread cheers
that was the first red flag for me... when i heard her name being part of the show sometime last year  i was welppp this show is gonna bomb.
a disgusting one  yes
@deanfirnatine7814  after i am not starfire and gotham high

@taiyggdrasil648  even the first live action movies paid homage to the spirit of the show and the characters.
@death8724  its a weird trend man.
@justmehere6094  facts.
@themagus9860 a
@crimzonnova5368  according to rotten tomatoes  6  of people gave this show a 3.5 5 or above  so i d say they are the  modern audience  they ruined this i.p. and so many more for.
same my dude.the desecration is intentional and malicious.
@crimzonnova5368  maybe the 200 million supposedly on the moon are the modern audience they speak of
don t accept any ruining of any characters or franchises when they don t line up with the original. the fact kaling wasted time  money  and labor on this including the many who signed on for it is not a good thing.
they will destroy everything you hold dear.....
@lastlime3792  no they won t. countless people like myself know the true og material and have physical versions. if they try that gestapo nazi stuff see how it turns out for them.if you submit then that is subjectively your fault.
@lastlime3792  that s what i have been saying  for a long ass time.
@crimzonnova5368   he meant to say a  moronic audience.  once you see it from that perspective  then you will understand who the target audience is.
thisisnotmyvelma
@cuckertarlson3037  it s just funny when someone s tries to troll with a keep comping and everything laughs at them and responds with something much better lol
every time they use  modern audience ... remember... they really mean  minority audience .
its okay just keep watching the old scooby doo  and cancel hbo max
@smurfie8412  keep reeee!
@user-ze8te2jk2w  well said.
@seankeller1560  its the button meme of perfection
won t forgive
changed for a woke audience
@omgojira  no you reeee! bigot!
@smurfie8412  wow that s the best you got  your insults really do suck  just like the velmainfact they suck so bad  even johnny sins doesn t want it anymore
@smurfie8412  it s made for you 1  of the population hahhaa
@smurfie8412  also bud  my mom is a great woman and a great mother  i doubt she would waist her life with a child like you  harry potter will never go away andhogwarts legacy is gonna be badass and amazing  but you aren t ready to hear that
@smurfie8412  you don t even know what bigotry actually means human
@crimzonnova5368    like seriously who are these people trying to appeal to   -  i m not convinced they attempted to appeal to anyone.  it feels more like this is all about mindy and what she wanted to make  not what fans or anyone wanted them to do.
@smurfie8412  get lost troll.
you mean   garbage audience   right
@uller1967  making a fan fiction is one thing. but expecting others to like it is insane!
@smurfie8412  troll
@crimzonnova5368  the radical left and sjws crowd is what they mean by that.
@smurfie8412  yep the velma fan has been discovered  what re your pronouns bud
suprised they haven t made pop eye black
yes
it s mindy taking out her anger on all the hot white guys who ignored her in high school. the whole show is just pure bitterness and spite. just like she-hulk.
that movie is a thousand times more mature than this show even though it was meant for kids and this is meant for adults
i ve been saying this about  redos  for so long  people can never be original and create fresh faces and build a new world  it s always transforming what s already there and ruining what was.
well  dont you know  fred is whiteso go figure
not to mention that body positivity is preached by them 24 7 except when it comes to making fun of a man s penis size.
shaggy was really loveable and many female characters were attracted to shaggy through various versions. shaggy was never someone who would simp for anyone. he would only simp for food and he would put his dog the best character who isn t even in this show  before any love interest. they did him dirty. velma was smart  clumsy  cute  kind in all the versions of scooby doo so i refuse to call the character here velma. this is mindy trying to cosplay velma.
exactly! what they did to fred was just plain mean-spirited. melonie said they made him look like his previous self  but they make him have these really awful facial expressions  to show us how  rich and spoiled  he is. horrid.
@charlieberry7562  mindy would totally be that girl that would shame a man for his one eyed yougurt slinger
honestly that sounds like a good idea. a group of anti-mystery inc  the really negative side of the stereotypes. i m thinking the new fred is a self proclaimed alpha male kinda guy  and they run into the gang all the time. mystery inc is really just that wholesome and nice and the new gang tries to beat them or corrupt them and it never works. could be some fun humor there.
holy crap-you are a genius. i would watch the bleep out of that show! honestly  if they had done that  i would likely have watched it  as it would have completely changed the...perception  i guess...of the show. but  of course  making them incompetent because they are mean and don t have the synergy of the scooby gang wouldn t have fir the narrative.
robot chicken already did that years ago
that would have been a better idea and call the show mindy adventures inc instead of sexual identity   race   religious swapping which is racists and sexist by the way.
yeah. now there s a fun idea!
this should never be a show about adults. everyone remembers the line    i would have gotten away with it. if it weren t for those meddling kids.  which means that the show is supposed to be for kids.
you know  with how many scooby doo clones that they own  this could have been a hilarious opportunity to do exactly that. have the scooby gang out  being wholesome and marketable and solving mysteries while the adult comedy show follows like... clue club or speed buggy or something. there s plenty of scooby clones to choose from that have been totally dead for eons -- brands that won t risk the core property s marketability.velma not only is a bad show  not only does it spit on the work from which it was derived  but more importantly than all of that  it makes scooby doo less valuable as a brand. this was a bad play  especially when the company isn t doing very well right now.
@justinroux1610  it s very important to her that a man s goo blaster be xxl -- but he can t be xxl  he has to be very handsome and very white.
chandler burse  it does! great show
@sujanaryal833  more like skinwalkering velma. at least cosplayers have some respect for the original character even if they can t match the same ethnic group the character is from.
indeed  to quote the tale of despereaux by kate dicamillo   stories are light. light is precious in a world so dark.
the actual quote from tolkien is  the shadow that bred them can only mock  it cannot make  not real new things of its own.  the one you gave is from tvtropes describing tolkien s idea.
puss and boots 2 was so good.
i took my son to watch it knowing nothing about it. it s just a damn good flic! not just a good kids movie but a good movie in its own right.
@buddingqueen  i  as some random goofball on the internet  recommend it.
i watched the new puss in boots and it was fantastic. well executed and it actually dove pretty deep into our fear of death and trauma but man was it freaking good. i was genuinely surprised.
@travisbishop782  you definitely avoided disaster sir by going to see puss in boots 2 i know it is velma is on hbo max but i m not going to bother with it it s already getting destroyed some woman on youtube she said hopefully people will stop watching it the smart ones s an old saying being dead that s not a problem but forgotten that s when the real b   kicks in don t worry i trust antonio banderas ever since desperado
booga-booga!
omg i never saw that cross over it sounds amazing im going to find where i can watch it asap courage the cowardly dog was such special show for me as a kid and a crossover between the two just sound so pleasant i cant wait to watch it
its a reflection of reality.
yeah it s a truly nasty show  it s so bizarre how these shows make their characters so nasty inadvertently. they simply don t see it because their amoral. just don t kill people seems to be their only rule now  besides woke offenses
@teopalafox  based on medical calls i have been on as a emt-firefighter  you are correct
why can t you spell literally right when spell check is built into keyboards now  also  i m sure everyone hating this show  loved euphoria and it was teenagers screwing the entire series
@vexx506  have you ever watched euphoria on hbo
@emperorstarscream  both this show and euphoria is hot garbage.
@scorpion6328  teenagers love euphoria  my daughter s entire high school was obsessed with it
she suffered brain damage from the assault. also how come velma wasn t arrested for assaulting her to begin with  in the show  according to the reviews i seen of it   daphne mums are cops. they should have done something.
there has been this obsession  even before the woke trend  of relationships having a semblance of abuse at their core. not always physical. it can be constant bickering  estrangement  manipulation  etc. i ve seen a like of shows and movies of people who are  meant for each other  or are the absolute definition of best friends... but they spend most of the time at each other s throats are even ignoring each other.
probably since sadly lesbian relationships have a higher statistic for abuse so people wanna make fun of that. since this show makes fun of everything it does and its fans
@tkdboy1889  that s called passion
@emperorstarscream  so treating each other horribly is  passion   disagreeing and arguing is one thing  actively working against each other and hurting each other is another.also i never even heard of euphoria until you mentioned it  not sure why you assumed everything that is dunking on velma loves euphoria. i quickly looked it up and the summary alone made me nope right out.
at least korra took more than 2 episodes to develop korrasami. they literally go from 0 to 100 in two episodes  what is this writing
@tkdboy1889  literally just went right to see what was this about euphoria and what i found was euphoria follows a group of high school students as they navigate love and friendships in a world of drugs  sex  trauma and social media. no  nope  never  not gonna watch it thank you  sir madam for giving me the warning. i truly appreciate it and now will avoid  this  like the plague. god bless you
the same people wrote this show came from the same hole as the people who wrote finn being hit by a stick from rei for no reason and he ended up being a simp screaming her name 24 7 for the rest of the trilogy.
korra was in abusive lesbian relationship
@tkdboy1889  the first season of euphoria is interesting actually  i didn t think i d like it either  it s definitely not woke or focused on the diversity  the characters are diverse  but that isn t what defines them
@emperorstarscream  obvious troll is obviously a troll
@mrmistah1588  i haven t watched velma  but euphoria is a pretty good show  how s that trolling  it s another hbo show about high school kids  played by 30 year olds
interesting fact  domestic battery is higher among lesbians than it is for any other demographic.
@quran112083  does that make you feel superior or something  a way to minimize your insecure feelings about them snatching your women
@emperorstarscream  luckily no
@vexx506  it s pretty good  if you enjoy entertainment  it s not harry potter tho
look up cyraxx. that s who this is for.
excellent point! they re suppose to be minors  yet they re over sexualized. i mean at this point you might as well a character that resembles r kelly for crying out loud.
and shows like this are protected under our 1st amendment due to them not being indistinguishable from a real child or based on a real child. which is the right call because all policing fictional content does it takes time and valuable resources from helping actual victims of csa
fr
i know people write fanfics and put the characters in sexual situations but they age them up and actually give a good storyline.
anime says hello senpai....
@cuckertarlson3037  although i hate this version of scooby doo cartoon tv show and wb needs to retire the scooby franchise of awhile lol.yes i was looking for your comment anime does do that i was looking for this comment when i said the same thing
@angryfrancis87  at least anime creates original characters... and outside of that  can tend to actually be a good show with quite a lot to give when it comes to themes and character depth.velma stands on it s own in a circle of hell and shouldn t even be compared to anime
yeah  i m sure you didn t even glance at anyone in that way  when you were their age
@batman0  i dread and will regret to ask....but who is cyraxx is  and how bad the damage with cyraxx
@batman0   infected junk pics  ! you jest.....
@sentientguillotine   thank you!!
@mrquadro83  these are grown as people drawing underage women naked. i am not the age of the writers by far and i find it absolutely disgusting and if you defend if well let s just say you had better watch out for the fbi
@mrquadro83  ...please tell me you are fucking joking.
@asto6965  about what
@cep088  okay and  if you gotta live in fear of what others say for being in the right then that speaks more about you than anything else. besides kinda hard for a trans to be transphobic lmao
@batman0  who is that cyraxx
like when mindy said daphne was around just to be sexy... like did she forget about scooby doo and the 13 ghost. thats literally shaggy  daphne and scooby. no fred or velma. daphne actually makes herself useful in that series.
i think it s because the people wanting velma to be gay are the same people who wanted their popular characters they grew up with being mostly straight and white into them  because they are jealous and can t  see themselves  in the white characters. don t you find it weird that these people never bring up the original minority characters as if they aren t good enough for them they never cheer or celebrate static shock  vixen  john stewart  green lantern  or blade it s actually sad because they are left on the back shelves.
@kumikoloh9190  it s sad indeed. i m latino but static shock was my childhood show along with gargoyles  justice league   dragon ball and samurai x  shame about the author through . over the years i have grown to truly appreciate how good they were. they weren t just cool cartoons animes were the good guys girls were fighting cool fights  those series had usually moral lessons. something now lost on today s cartoons.and if i can not only be empathic to a person of a different color but also identify with him  why not them  it s a sad life i wish not for myself. and mayhaps i m a fool but i pray for them to find some form of peace cause that mentality would a hell for me
they ve shown involved  or at least interested in several men over the years. there was windsor from  scooby doo! legend of the phantosaur   but he turned out to be one of the bad guys. johnny bravo  and sam winchester in the  scoobynatural  episode. possibly others  but those 3 are the ones i know off the top of my head.
the argument for velma being gay is that the entire original scooby gang characters are based on the characters of the sitcom  the many loves of dobie gillis . velma is based on the character of zelda gilroy who is played by actress sheila kuehl who is in fact a lesbian. however the character zelda has a crush on dobie  the basis of fred  and forever plans to marry him someday  though he is smitten by the beautiful but money-grubbing thalia  daphne . ergo if velma is supposed to be zelda  then she should canonically be straight.
velma was bisexual. she was into both fred and daphne. they just never focused on the characters sexualities in the cartoon.
@kumikoloh9190   to be completely fair  the jl animated series used john stewart instead of hal jordan  and hawkgirl instead of hawkman  to make their main cast more diverse  and people were cheering on miles morales in the spiderverse movie.  vixen did have a brief stint with the cw  though i never really paid attention to that.  when i was a kid  there was also jackie chan adventures  american dragon jake long  the life and times of juniper lee  nowadays  disney channel has owl house and amphibia.other than that  the take on velma is spot on.  a lot of people who are unpopular and  think  they are smart feel they can relate more with the nerdy velma instead of the confident fred or the pretty daphne.  because velma does not fit the typical standard of feminine beauty  modern adaptations feel free to play with the idea of velma being gay or bi as a way of being more inclusive.  the problem is that the character of velma is not suited to being a leader or being popular.  it s like how people with phds are usually not multi-billionaire ceos simply because they are involved more with research than taking the initiative with risky business ideas or leading a group.  even scooby himself cannot carry a series by himself  he needs at least his best friend shaggy  for there to be a proper dynamic.  velma  esp. this iteration  is simply too toxic a person for her popularity to be believable  which takes people out of the experience.
that would be a she-hulk ending for this series.
if you want some good shows to give you nostalgia  what s new scooby-doo and mystery inc. are good choices.
mystery inc. is a must for scooby doo fans. still the best iteration in many ways.
the most egregious  they re minors!!  moment was that shower scene.
mindy kaling s c.v. father is a well-known architect  mother was a successful doctorgrew up in the rich area of cambridge  massachusettsgraduate darmouth college  ivy league  with a degree in playwriting  they have degrees in that  immediately went to work in show business--never waitressed  never did housekeeping  never did an honest day s work in her life  just went from a rich suburb to a rich kids  school to a rich kids  idea of a jobshe has all that  and she s this bitter and hateful mindy kaling isn t velma--she s fred.
i ve been waiting for you to make a video about this. i wasn t disappointed.i ll admit i ve never seen it   i don t want to. the one thing that annoys me is that they took a well established character that everyone knows   they not only ruined her but they literally ran her through the local pay  n  spray and changed her skin color   race.if you want to have a black character in a show that s fine but don t take well established characters that everyone knows and make them completely different from who they were   say they are the same or similar characters when they are not.this was clearly made by   for the woke people. i m glad i don t have hbo max if i did i would ve cancelled my subscription instantly after seeing this.
the worst part is  i believe it s already been approved for a season 2
during halloween it s melonie mac go boo.
idk why  grown  has to be naked  disabled or an alphabet person these days. it can t just be mature storylines anymore
i once heard someone say that you can learn as much how to write by observing bad writing over good writing. seems like there are a lot of examples of bad writing to learn from now in days anyway.
the saddest thing is that had mindy and company cared about making a good scooby doo show  or better yet  an original work influenced by scooby doo they could have made this work.picture it  a group of college kids from different walks of life  who constantly clash w each other  have to learn to work together to solve a murder mystery- someone is murdering popular girls at the university in the same manner as the infamous black dhalia murders of the late 1940s  and these young adults take it upon themselves to solve the mystery - and protect themselves from the killer. you basically take a mix of scooby doo  heathers  the breakfast club  and cold case  and create a hbo special. you get to have dark  edgy  and at times profane immature humor  while not being overly creepy about it.
i have this or that disorder  as an excuse to act like a jerk is exactly on point  in fact i suspect a lot of these newly  discovered  so-called disorders were actually invented by therapists to validate their patients  behavior and thus keep their income stream flowing  and also make a lot of revenue for the pharmaceutical industry with their prescriptions.
6 10 hold up  isn t velma supposed to be super smart  why would she want shaggy of all people to give her homework answers
the worst you can do here is hatewatch  don t give them numbers they are so desperate for.
i feel like this happened allot before and also in different circumstances on movies or shows but for some reason this is where people wanna draw the line
when are these companies going to realize that the vast majority of people don t want woke remakes reimaginings  if you want to make woke content  i have no problem with that. people who want that kind of content are free to make it and consume it all they want. that is their right. but nobody asked them to completely change beloved characters to fit an agenda. just start with something new.
they could have just said they hate scooby doo and everything about it and saved everyone a lot of time and money
it really should be called mindy s animated mystery project making it the follow up to the mindy project show she did that i heard wasn t bad but was forgettable. she just slightly reskinned her own idea for her latest self-indulgence project with an existing warner ip to give it some appeal to the clapping seals in charge of project approval. the problem is that she has no idea what she is doing. i mean  in the mindy project i m told she played an ob gyn  and one of her parents was an ob gyn so she had some sort of background and stories she d heard of her parent s job to build on. boom. a path to some success i guess  but  obviously  neither of her parents were detectives so there s nothing for her to build on except vague remembrances of this ip she s stealing borrowing from. i mean  let s face it  wealthy family  private schools  then ivy league  then hollywood.  according to imdb that seems to have been the life of mindy.  which means that mindy has no idea what real life is like. she s been privileged enough to make fred look average. it s just not a recipe for success. the original had a group of unlikely but very good friends who had nothing in common apparently and yet they all came together and worked together to help others with their mysteries. diversity of backgrounds forming a unit. this one has diversity of races and backgrounds and they all hate each other and want to destroy each other. um  okay  the appeal meter is reading zero.
i have been diagnosed with asperger syndrome for many years and i have never once used any foreign excuse to cry for attention. if anything people tell me that i am more admirable because i don t use that disability as a crutch  so much i have learned was more or less on my own if i do have an education of some kind like a mediatech institute then i m sharpening what i already know to be better.  not to mention getting my foot in the door to get paid for something i love doing anyway.
i think we should just ignore shows like this. like  don t care . this would be the hardest slap in the face of those people. then they can t say that people are this and that because nobody would even talk to them. i mean  we have our originals and nobody will take them away  and we have mods for old games.
i watched your she hulk videos and a few witcher ones. was damn excited to see you did this. makes me wanna keep watching your channel also the screenshot at 11 43 velma and norville better be careful before daphne goes kissing her too since shes a cheater in this series
i was talking to a friend of mine via text on discord this morning about how hbo wb cancelled woke justice for this show. i clarified after by saying that young justice was really good in its 1st and 2nd seasons  before the wokeness hit it. following with stating how when the d i wasn t at the forefront  the show was still interesting  far more than velma  anyway.the whole point that i m making with this is the fact that young justice didn t need diversity  certainly not after we got the 2nd season. a world full on aliens  clones  and genetically modified teenagers with superpowers  does the current political climate really need to be a point of contention within its universe  and so brazenly vapid at that velma  the last two seasons of young justice  the witcher blood origin  rings of power  and most of marvel s recent lineup. these are all examples of what happens when the equivalent to cringe-inducing deviantartists and wattpad fanfic creators get to hold the reigns for ips now  where being engaged to these franchises led to fans and so-called  fans  to make the very same cringe headcanons when it wasn t official in the actual aforementioned franchises and the like back then.
having a girl name scooby is like a middle finger to us
you miss the part where they aren t real people it s a drawing... haven t seen the show and ain t gonna watch it but can we please separate fantasy from reality! they aren t real  same as the 3d pixels that many of us have killed in video games they re not real.i think we should crusade more against things like that abomination known as cuties those are real kids! that s a problem  these are drawings and i don t think they re having real underage children voice these characters.
@kaosapprentice nah bro  you draw underage kids in a sexualized way then your messed up in the head. shows like big mouth should be outlawed since it depicts kids as willing adventurous participants that just want to  explore  themselves . makes the maps think they aren t doing anything wrong...
@kaosapprentice  nope  it s still children being portrayed in a adult  suggestive  sexual1zed manner. the people that made big mouth need to be put on a list  as does anyone who actually enjoys that trash. they re trying to normalize this crud and it is disturbing. next your going to try and tell me there s nothing wrong with watching lolita henta1
@kaosapprentice  english-language term defining a young girl as  precociously seductive.  it originates from vladimir nabokov s 1955 novel lolita  which portrays the narrator humbert s sexual obsession with and victimization of a 12-year-old girl whom he privately calls  lolita   the spanish nickname for dolores
@cuckertarlson3037  heard of that story never read it... i ask for the definition of loli because you put it next to henta1 and in anime it mean  petite body type  it doesn t mean child there are no real life loli just fyi.
@cuckertarlson3037  one extra like
closed case. its the way she goes boys  the f ckin  way she goes...
based on what i ve seen from velma  mindy kaling seems to have hang-ups about not being popular in her formative years and is constantly bringing her personal baggage into every media project she s involved in.  however  what she wants  a world where she can be popular and the smartest person in the room while putting minimal efforts of self-improvement  is simply not good for appealing to an outside audience.  she is remarkably similar to fred  or rather  dennis from  it s always sunny in philadelphia.  like dennis  she acts like a entitled narcissist who puts people down and is willingly blind to her own faults to avoid accountability for her actions.  the difference is that dennis is just a character who is at least entertaining and gets his comeuppance  whereas the audience is expected to root for velma and her success without earning that right.
i m not surprised if the writers and artists have a hidden stash of child pornography in their desks. does anyone remember a popular manga artist who got arrested for child porn or dan schnider creator of drake and josh and icarly  abusing teen girls
@kumikoloh9190  schneider seemingly had a fetish involving feet. to make matters worse  these were feet from some of the then underaged actresses.
@cuckertarlson3037  what is big mouth  i d google it but i m afraid of what horrors i might find
@trueblue2363  it s a adult animated show on netflix about kids going through puberty and who want to shag anything and everything. it s really disgusting. one of the scenes has a little girl playing with herself for the first time and it literally shows everything   and i mean everything    it even gets worse then that but i can t even describe it because my comment will get removed.
@kumikoloh9190  don t forget the allegations against john kricfalusi  the creator of ren and stimpy.
@hakimshaberdashery  thanks
@kaosapprentice  it s pedophilia  even if it is a cartoon
@manoz6194  okay fine with that logic it s murder if you kill people in a video game and you should go to jail for it.
@kaosapprentice  umm no  sexualising children is wrong  whichever way you do it
@manoz6194   okay not that i m defending velma  but still  at the end of the day  these drawn fictional characters aren t comparable to the real thing..... and there really isn t any scientific evidence of this content making people become actual p-files to real life.... plus velma and big mouth are far from being the first adult american cartoons that did this crap  beavis and butthead  family guy and south park does this crap a lot.... especially how the main cast in south park are freakin elementary students....but those shows are somehow forgiven....
my guess is that was supposed to be an original show but they just slapped the scooby doo ip to get people talking about it
@geekbro6265  that s usually how disasters like this happen.
best comment  pay n spray  just made me lol!
@psibug565  thank you!
i have a different theory. maybe they fully knew how controversial this show would be and intentionally wrote it that way. so while wokes and anti-wokes clash  one end of the spectrum  hate-watches  the show just to subsequently create mass awareness by complaining about it  hence creating a hate-watching stampede  the other end indeed watches  just because  and writes blogs and articles about how it s a courageous piece of art in criticising american culture and what not. both ends of the spectrum are  in my view  full of shit but what they have in common is that they get played like a fiddle by the powers that be who use one of the oldest tricks in the book to rule over them  divide and conquer. so why not go ahead and monetize their weakness  so yeah  thanks for not watching this show. the next step would be to simply ignore it but that would cost some youtubers their livelihood if we really took this to heart on a grander scale  i imagine.
ran her through the local pay n  spray . i m using that line.
i ride on my sisters hbo.
@ancogaming  is not controversial just because people are talking about it. this is the version of people talking about it in a non controversial way. it s that lame that it s where entropy goes to die. the separation you speak of is done already. this show is post wokotrash.
shows you that hollywood has no creativity.
let s not forget that it has a rating of 1.3 10 on imdb.
say sike right now.
no way thats possible and even if it has hbo will find a way to cancel it  the mere fact its so bad we have woke idiots on the internet claiming the show was created by secret conservatives to psy-op the country into hating woke just shows how bad this show actually is
@burntlithium9437  it s crazy! a second season planned despite the negative reviews from fans.
it was but clearly they had a contract for a season 2 irregardless of how well season 1 did so it was preemptive
pretty sure season 2 was greenlit before anyone outside of wb even saw it.
you know what s weird about the woke creators  they always target the straight  white popular characters to race swap but they never make the original gay or black characters popular. where is iceman  where is vixen  where is cyborg and static shock  where is blade it would be insulting to minorities when the creators don t expand enough on the original left over characters but swap out the white straight characters into gay and black as a  hand-me-down .
@geekbro6265  basically. i feel like this was supposed to be a show based on mindy kaling being a teenager  but they saw how badly it sucked ass  and then had to repackage it.
they always have to piggy back off the achievements of others. taking well established characters and race swapping them or making them female. just make original characters make them whatever race or gender you want. problem is people won t flock to a woke show  their only hope is drawing people in using characters they already know and hope they like it.
great idea  but you ll never get a job in hollywood because your parents aren t rich--are they
it is a great idea. but it requires talent  intelligence  and creativity to pull it off. things hollywood doesn t value anymore. just propaganda.
i saw the mindy project and it was unfunny as hell
@trueblue2363  i ll take your word for it as i never saw it.  i will say that my friend who i asked about it and said it wasn t bad but forgettable seemed to not remember it well  so she probably blocked out the worst bits from her memory.
i don t think that s enough. i think we need to freeze out everyone involved with them as well  writers  actors  directors  animators  musicians  the uber eats guy who delivers their lunch. order 66 all of them. a complete social media blackout  the digital equivalent of dropping them down a well to be forgotten by the rest of the world. the studio heads aren t listening so the only way to get the message across is to make the talent suffer for getting on board in the first place.
i clarified after by saying that young justice was really good in its 1st and 2nd seasons  before the wokeness hit it.  that s not an accident. esg programming follows success and latches on to it like a tick on a dog s happy sack. this is why if the first season of any show is a hit  you can almost guarantee that by the second or third  it will be an absolute dumpster fire. if you doubt me  just wait for  wednesday  season 2.
i was one of those people who wanted young justice back when it was cancelled. but the climate of the time when i wished for that was very different from the times now  and when the show returned  i was briefly excited until i actually sat down to watch it. i only got halfway through the 3rd  season. it was so unbearably bad that i wished the show hadn t come back.i m 100  pinning blame on cringe-worthy dumblr politics and their abominable  culture.  the entertainment industry is chock-full of people who sympathize with those sentiments  and the whole debacle really marked a turning point for me in further opening my eyes to this garbage. i ve learned to no longer expect anything of quality from screenwriters unless proven otherwise  and i don t give them a single cent until i m absolutely sure. edit  i meant 3rd  not 4th.
hopefully it angers the social justice folks and they shut this show down  feels weird to be rooting for censorship
so far that s just a rumor and i hope it s just that
@trueblue2363  i can t believe they are even considering a season 2 it s such a sh   show
yes! i watched puss in boots the last wish last weekend and it was great  wholesome  and actually made me laugh out loud. aka the antithesis of velma!
you can t even woke right  is my new favourite sentence
seriously puss in boots was a home run! took my son knowing nothing about it. but i d go watch it with the bros or a serious date with a girl. movie production companies should take notes.
mindy is the definition of privilege. she grew up upper class  went to an ivy league college   never had to struggle to get where where she is. she made velma herself insert but this version of fred is actually her.
i use videos like yours to review content before my kiddos can watch it. thank you for providing context into this show. i have seen it on hbo-max and i am very glad i didnt sit down with my girls to watch this as a family.
i agree with a suggestion clownfish made. specifically  that is not going to be the scooby-do character. that is going to be the character the shag...err  norvile will end up naming scooby after. probably with something along the lines of  what would scoobi do   after which the dog will bark and presto  he s got his name.
jumped in here for just a velma bash... which is what happened.... and totally deserve! keep it going!
the bright spot with this velma controversy is that it s getting me in the mood to try out a bunch of scooby-doo media that looks like fun instead of watching this current trash. me and my dad just watched this direct-to-video movie called  frankencreepy   and not only does it feel a bit more modern while also being faithful to the original characters  but the humor is so much better too.
hey melonie. velma is horrible. and they sexualize 15yr olds. hope you re doing well melonie. you look good. take care
i literally had no clue how sacred the original scooby-doo s were two people on both sides of the aisle. this is definitely an interesting scenario to see playing out
hollywood isn t changing  there just getting comfortable showing us who they truly are.
they could easily have made the main characters into legal adults  but they went out of their way to make them underaged and then put them in sexual situations. this is even worse than the de-aging in nu she-ra.
my theory is that they are setting a new low bar for the shows so that anything that comes after this one will look like an apotheosis of the senses
it s like when a spiteful ex comes by your place after you ve left for work and smashes all of your belongings to pieces just to get back at you. that s what these woke reboots feel like.
i am just waiting for scooby and the gang to remove her mask and find out it was a just a terrible person posing as velma all along.
i appreciate what you do in pointing out the garbage  ms. mac  and have no issue watching any content you or others in this sphere put out regarding it. i ve been at the point for a while where i refuse to even hate watch any of these shows as the suits that give the green light to them as well as renewing them for another season don t care if you or i drag the show and or hate watch  just that we engage with it. if this is so stop we need to point it out  mock it  if you want   then ignore it
i am so dying for a character in a movie to give them a raging tongue lashing for once  what comes next be damned
i grew up with scooby-doo this just makes me so sad and disappointed with what they ve done
dude! you can t even woke right!  that was hilarious
i m glad you didn t make the joke  they changed scooby from a dog to a female!  bword  . taking the high road is a good thing
i recommend watching all the original scooby-doo movies they were always higher budget then the show and done extremely well almost every movie is great and absolutely every single one is family friendly
ikr it s sickening
it s disgusting
the true horror of the show is the show creators and mindy
south park and family guy. simpsons movie.
@charlieberry7562  they have nei morality
the scooby doo franchise is a relic of the hippie era and the longest lasting of all the hanna-barbera cartoons  being revived in the 90s  and seeing multiple iterations across several generations.  most adults know what scooby doo is and the general formula for its episodes  no matter what episode of whatever series you watch  one can expect to see the mystery gang solve family-friendly mysteries involving monsters and ghosts.  it s not really meant to be controversial  deep or political  just something to view with the family.bringing scooby doo into the modern culture wars with all its divisiveness is therefore a bad idea.  there is too much violent and sexual content to be family friendly  and it s too meta and subversive for scooby doo fans to enjoy.  the show portrays diversity in such a needless and toxic manner that even leftists can t tolerate it  they want good representation like steven universe  not bad representation   so its a real question as to who the show was meant for.  there are many iterations of scooby doo over the decades with their own creative quirks - some good  some not so good - so it s not like you can t make changes.  however  none of them are as mean-spirited and spiteful as  velma.  the show goes out of its way to hate on established characters and to hate  adults who watch cartoons    so the backlash is warranted.  in this day and age where everyone is pessimistic and political after co-vid  no one wants to be preached to and demeaned by an  edgy  scooby doo cartoon  esp. by a privileged hollywood insider.
they turned scooby from a dog to a knitter
they took scooby doodipped it in cyanidethis happened
why must every show i loved watching as a child be remade and corrupted. another great review and analysis! the question is...can i justify watching puss in boots by myself as a single 36 year old man
the teaser trailer for velma literally mocked the fans by having velma send a letter to hbo max about judy jetson s origin story not having her be  boy crazy . jinkies.  i also agree that puss in boots  the last wish did a better job!  it was the closest thing i could get to a good animated movie for 2022  along with the bad guys and sonic the hedgehog 2
after oceans 8 you couldn t imagine another failure of that magnitude for mindy and  wokeness .   well  someone in hollywood  said   hold my beer .
someone needs to call a priest asap to exorcise the entire cast and everyone involved with this intere  show  especially mindy  groomer and destroyer of childhoods   kailing
modern audience  just means  people who refuse to be happy
i can t think of show so universally hate to this level all sides hate it it s something that unites us together
it s incredible how lately we have witnessed one of the best animated movies  puss in boots  and one of the worst  if not the absolute worst  animated series of all time lol. what a time to be alive.
i think the next tomb raider will take the same route like velma if the leak is anything to go by. the info we have on the anime already sounds like scooby doo  lara road-tripping with friends to save the world   then the leak wants to arbitrarily make her lesbian  like with velma  and insert random pocs here and there  like with velma . add to this the entire writer s room consisting of they them woke women  and you ve got the perfect recipe for disaster. i honestly can t wait for it crash and burn. i want the franchise taken from crystal.
i was so surprised that a friend of mine say why all the hate for the show and she liked it. i am like did we watch the same thing  she literally said the only positive thing she saw about it was hers on twitter. good she spreading positivity but not for velma please
puss in boots  antonio banderas   cute kitty  funny  good animation  good writing
that courtroom scene reminds me of the same one in she hulk where jen just rags on the white male because she can  in this case it helps him but of couse the whole purpose was to emasculate him.
and they said they weren t coming for the kids ...
even the supernatural cross over was more wholesome.
these people are so obsessed with shipping because they ve never had a real healthy relationship themselves.
fred was one of the nicest and sweetest characters in the whole of scooby doo he was smart and level headed too they ve butchered this ip
hi melonie you should never suffer through  velma at least the first episode of the last of us was decent and sit throuable but it might be a bait and switch
they sure don t make it easy too support these streaming companies
thanks for the coverage. hard to believe how far we ve fallen
i m beginning to feel like this was made because i once said jenifer walters was a lot like velma. they made this show to match mcu jenifer walters!
contact me for your reward
you can t exorcise that. just excise it with an accountant.
you re onto something
how does velma end up asking black shaggy for math homework  that does not make sense.
its mindy kaling we talking about  its completely what we should expected from her
3 00 the last time i ever thought about relationships in old school scooby-doo  before mystery incorporated which had their relationships as part of the story  was as a young teen watching 13th ghost of scooby-doo and wondering for a bit if shaggy and daphne were a thing given they were the only original crew after scooby-doo left.
they changed...the dawg !  lmao
hmm  what you said about people with anxiety not acting like that  has given me an idea for my sailor moon v.m. sequel fanfic. you see  in my story  there s a new character  who happens to be a mysterious long-lost twin of princess serenity   sailor moon  who happens to be a vampire  set she s also a devout christian  called yuzuki kagehoshi  aka vampire moon  though she is a superhero  usually friendly  generally sweet-natured and incapable of feeling hate  she s also very shy and quite timid of people  she s also quite smart intellectually but also very nieve . anyway  as you might have guessed  although i am unsure if it s been mentioned yet  but it s pretty obvious that she s supposed to have  genuine  anxiety problems and panic attacks  particularly with her phobia of drawing because she can t swim and worry of not being good enough for her new friends  the first friends she s ever had  partly because she was a vampire and even though she s actually a good vampire  on top of because she fears that she had done something really terrible long-ago in her forgotten past  etc.  and that she s secretly evil  though she s anything but  . anyway  i m unsure how this will go yet  but the idea i just had is that i could put in a scene where we have another character  a villain or side-character  who does this over-exaggerated fake panic-attack thing to get attention to the point of mockery... this understandably starts to upset poor yuzuki  who is beginning to have fewer panic attacks and less anxiety as the story and hero s journey progresses thanks to her perhaps over-protective friend support  although sailor moon s over-protectiveness is starting to be a major problem in itself .
they not only made scoobi a person  but then made her a love interest for shaggy. that is so fucked up
hbo exec says-  mindy your show is looking terrible  i m sorry.   mindy responds-  terrible   i was going for abhorrent and completely unwatchable  hold my beer
comes off as a show that started out as something else but they didnt think it could make it on its own so it was reformatted to connect to scooby doo
now what you and everybody seem to be forgetting is that this is an origin story. they are eventually going to be working together to solve mystery for a common purpose. i don t think that would with this story nor will it feel natural.
they latch on to existing properties rather than make up their own because they know this is going to fail so they figure why not drag the stuff people like down with it.
wb greenlit velma season 2 and is keeping ezra miller for flash  yeah someone needs to clean house at that company.
as i said on another thread  putting a  male  character in a green t-shirt and calling him by a vague name attributed to shaggy does not make said character shaggy.
it s wild that this is one of the few things to ever unite the different demographics on the internet
good thing they still have all those old scooby doo episodes lingering about
just to point out  wb cancelled the scoob 2 movie release but decided to still green light this. it shows how much they care about the franchise.
every streaming service is competing to have the worst show.
hey melonie. great to see a new video. you look hecking gorgeous today. hope the rest of your day is fantastic.
i blame modern psychology for a lot of the problems with people using their diagnosis as a crutch to continue with their negative behavior. i started noticing it 15 years ago. i dated a girl with bpd  and she would continuously use it as an excuse to be an insufferable pain in the neck. had she not been diagnosed that way  she could have instead been taught coping mechanisms with her life. a diagnosis  it has been my experience  tends to be used more as an excuse to continue with their bad behavior than a disease to be overcome.
and the worst part about this show  is that you know the directors are going to pull a she-hulk and turn the entire situation on its head to say  a-ha! this whole show was meant to troll the trolls! and it was a success!  what a horrible excuse that was  considering the  trolls  berating these shows and movies are literally the fans of the original ip s demanding their favorite properties not be so slandered.
it s something this show is rumored to get a season 2.
nobody asked
@ross354  i 2nd that.
what in the wall of text is this
velma doesnt have panic attacks. looks like schizophrenia but whatever. youd figure the show would be self aware enough to know that. considering how overtly 4th wally everyone is. velma would be the type to point it out every 3 seconds.
shout out and respect for shout now puss in boots new movie. the first one was great and this one did well too. and i wouldn t say it s completely only for kids because anything shrek related as always had some adult humor but it s so hidden that it ll go over children s heads that way both the child and the adult can enjoy the film. i only know this because i went and rewatch shrek the first movie recently after almost a decade plus and noticed a lot of things i didn t notice when i was younger.
i can t upset about fictional  minors  in  inappropriate  situations. not like it s that netflix movie that had real child actresses being sexualized.
i said it once and i ll say it again - hollywood is filled with a lot of people writing really bad fan fiction you used to only find on tumblr.
thanks for the video!  i didn t hear  zoinks!  once in those clips so i m gonna have to pass on this new version. time to get in the mystery machine and solve the whodunnit of who stole melonie s wrinkles and blemishes. cmon gang!
mel! i m a grown ass man and i went to see  puss in boots  just to kill time and i actually  really  enjoyed  the  movie!
at this point i m just going to watch the original classic shows.
i think this show was probably supposed to be an entirely different show  but just to get the views they slapped familiar characters all over it  otherwise it would ve gained less than zero traction.
abomination  is being nice.
i dont know what everyone is talking about velma is a great show. it s straight fire. fire story  fire characters  fire plot twist. it s so fire we can see it burning to ashes right before our eyes
the only good line was when the crowd was hating fred and a random guy said they make everyone they dislike out to be hitler. also the one bit where she admits that she realised that she prejudged somoen cause she didn t like them.
3 17 as somebody who suffered from panic attacks so bad it derailed my life for at least a decade.  i would actively avoid any kind of negativity as it just made things worse including schadenfreude or laughing at somebody else misfortune.
and then velma tries to use someone else s mental health issues in order to publicly embarrass them and receive public riticul.....course it completely backfires when the crowd is  like  not cool. mental health is a serious thing  dinkly!     but then after that  the incident is brushed under the rug the show moves on to the next train wreck scenario.   it is almost as if the writers decided to create the show with stream of concious brainstorming  and kept everything that came up .
what if they did make there own characters but the studio didn t trust it was going to do well  and said use scooby-doo to tell there story.  just a thought
so can i just say that i thought friday s video was one of your best     for real  it was.i know you ve mentioned you feel that your god-focused content doesn t score the same number of views as your entertainment-focused vids  but think about this  what kind of comments do you often receive the most more often than not  you get all sorts of comments from people thanking you for the help you ve given them. for the impact you ve left on their lives. you see all sorts of people thanking you for being a bold witness for god! that s because the work you do for god has eternal worth and value. regardless of what the views are  what ultimately matters is that you are positively impacting people s lives by standing boldly for jesus  and god s word never returns void. long after the pink-haired hollywood locust horde has eaten itself alive  your god-focused content will be one of the most celebrated things people will remember about you because it s been so helpful  sound and edifying. you re not trying to tickle anyone s ears  you re trying to give people real  solid truth. just as well  you re also trying to show everyone the dangers of woke ideology-- an ideology that seeks to undermine god  destroy children  and eradicate authentic biblical womanhood. you re pointing people to the truth and hope that s found only in jesus. tv shows come and go  but the things of god have eternal relevancy.think about what it says in proverbs    charm is deceptive  and beauty is fleeting  but a woman who fears the lord is to be praised. honor her for all that her hands have done  and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.  proverbs 31 30-31you fear the lord by boldly proclaiming him. and you proclaim him in a real  doctrinally solid  incredibly down-to-earth and winsome way. and back on friday  you uploaded one of your finest videos to date
saw both episodes and thought it was hilarious and great.
subscribers for hbo max might be like    they canceled all the shows i liked  but kept this. we have only seen the first few small mounts of snow at the top of the mountain start to crumble. we have yet to see what the full avalanche of this mess is going to look like.
to quote stan marsh   that s some fucked up shit right there.
if you just look up the voice actor and the producer mindy kaling you can see how the character vilma is literally her in a cartoon form. also seems as basically the same character in the office. even there she was barely bearable  but this is just horrid.
this is so brave and important and the creators are literal saints for breaking walls and creating diversity with this landmark achievement.  it s bad.  don t take it so seriously
thank you for being reasonable. cuties and what that weird fashion company did was disgusting and in my opinion if it has real child actors in it  then it should be illegal but drawings and books where no one was harmed in making it should be allowed to exist. imagine if we took that logic to the logical extreme we could see classics  such as romeo and juliet  outlawed  comstock laws were re-introduced
exactly  all adult animation does this like family guy  american dad  south park and hell do you remember clone high  it just a troupe the scene is still bad because of the  meta commentary joke
not only did they  race swap  characters  but they have also  species swapped  a dog into a back women. we now have  species-ism .  keep up the great content  melonie!
i like how  heck  is the universal profanity cover regardless of context
i love this series so far velma saying bitch is goals makes you feel a certain way   it s hilarious  i never thought she would say bitch but she did
if you have to watch it remember that you can always pirate.this way you don t contribute to streaming statistics ratings rankings.
apparently hbo max wanted to compete with netflix and disney on having a movie that can destroy a reputation so they decided to make something to rival netflix with cuties and to rival disney by making a worse she hulk.
tried watching and velma the character makes me think this is some massive delusion of grandeur that comes just before she would start shooting up the school because the illusion broke.  hell  at the end of that softcore child porn scene  she comes in and bashes daphne s head with a field hockey stick while covering her face.  if that doesn t scream psycho  nothing does.
the bad guys also a hidden gem as well dreamworks has been knocking it out the park lately
the last of us has a certain bit of the dufus male  but it works  and it is balanced out with a certain hard edge in joel that makes him believable.  why can t this velma yhing just be good
i loved puss in boots.   that was a great movie.   the villains were fun
this show does truly reflect how badly woke culture has affected the media and all the things that have been cherished before and nobody has ever had a problem with
scooby might be a girl that shaggy dates lmaooo
just when i thought things couldn t get anymore insane!
making scooby a black chick that not-shaggy dates is.... i literally have no word accurate enough to describe it. like what the honest to god fck !
the sad part is that it s getting a season 2...
0 08 a wild coletrain has appeared! thank you so much for covering this! scooby doo where are you  was my 2nd fav non-anime cartoon growing up and it is still my 2nd fav non-anime cartoon. my dad grew up on it and got me into it. this show just makes me sick and so angry! it is an abomination! the biggest abomination for television yet! even the wokies don t like it. i can t believe they are going to do a 2nd season for this garbage dump on fire of a show. my dad would be upset about this show  he must be rolling in his grave. william hanna and joseph barbera are for sure rolling in their graves. how many more of my fav franchises are going to be ruined by woke s  t ! i m sick and tired of the wokies and their s  t!
velma truly looks like peak hatefiction
now fred explains the implication to velma.
ladies and gentlemen  this is why i switched to anime and manga years ago. if wokeness ruins that  then volunteering to go to mars.
they made fred insufferable. one of my favorites of the gang. guy always had stoic leadership and very friendly. in this show he gets bashed for nothing and reduced to a trash character
well  one good thing came of this- it reminded me to check out mystery incorporated- i somehow missed out on it  but i ve heard it was really good!
bahaha yup
which is funny because it has a 1.3 10 rating on imdb. people are really upset about it. i m gonna pass on it because it looks nothing like the actual cartoons and the trailers i saw were an insult to the cartoons. or who knows  maybe i ll watch the first episode to see what it s like  but i m predicting it to not have a good look.
contact me for your reward
i don t think even she-hulk  the show  not just the character  has as much hate as velma  again the show  not just the character  does. the amount of hate they throw on fred and on each other is just so low. i don t think i ve seen a show with much hatred between characters as this  and there had been bad shows last year. this however totally destroys scooby doo  even more so than disney could have ever done with star wars and marvel or netlfix did with tolkien. on the other hand though  at least this has made people appreciate mystery inc. even more and even made many people aware of it.
so i found out some info that may get hbo and everyone involved in this series in a lot of trouble regarding this.warner brothers owns the rights to the entire scooby doo franchise. and they also have a sub company called warner media which owns hbo and hbo max. the fact that this series which does not have the warner brothers studio log on it means that this was done independently from warner brothers. in my experience as a cartoon watcher. every cartoon owned by some other studio always has this  in association with  disclaimer during the title sequence to let everyone know that this was done in conjunction with other company s. netflix does it with anime all the time by saying  based on the ____ manga by _____  none of that is there in this entire show and that could get everyone including hbo in serious trouble with this show.
remember the supernatural episode where sam and dean go into the scooby doo world and they stick to the lore  the gang acted just as they always did and it was a fun episode with nostalgia. i grew up watching scooby doo and always wanted a stuffed animal of scooby  didn t get one lol  so yeah i m gonna pass on this velma show.
velma is mindy kaling s self-insert however her real self is channeled trough fred s character!
mel  they re just subverting expectations  unfortunately for them damn near everyone expected this to be garbage.
as someone who grew up watching the original scooby-doo. velma is an insult to my intelligence.
who would ve thought that the one thing the left and right can agree on is scooby-doo
literally watching scooby squat in a random backyard would be more enjoyable than anything this show offers...
me waiting to see if doomcock is going to be the main villain again.
i heard that it was so woke that it was actually making fun of the woke and that s  why they hate it to. i watched the first 2 episodes with this in mind and i actually got a laugh. it s like watching south park or family guy time s 2. just my opinion.
thank you for your sacrifice of watching these terrible shows so i don t have to.
...could you imagine...just...imagine... velma...and scrappy...
i watched the first one for lulz. mindy clearly had a bad high school experience and this is like revenge corn for her
velma casually body shaming fred but you know
when 99  of the budget goes into inclusiveness and wokeness.
melonie mac and critical drinker would be such a youtube power couple
and in this case the monster is hbo max that got me.
the velma show is blasphemy and a disgrace to the scooby doo franchise!!! btw  i love your tattoos melonie
i really hope the worst time in mankind comes to an end soon. because everything just gets worse.
i think the entire writing and animation staff of that show need to end up the victims of a  hit and run  perpetrated by  the mystery machine  of the old cartoons.i hate to say it  and it may sound cruel  but sickos like that don t deserve to exist.
you left out the part where velma threw herself at sam and daphne turned psychotic once she realized monsters were real.   kill it with fire!!
it s still bad lol but whatever
then who is the show for  clearly  nobody.
corn
p
revenge corn  sounds perfectly good to me.  i can t think of anything else that this could possibly be.  it s certainly corny  but if i want something corny  i would rather drink cheap corn whisky than watch this.
first it was disney  with she-hulk  then rings of power by amazon prime  then later netflix with the witcher blood origin  i thought one after the other was the worst show  but by god.... it feels like hbo max with velma is trying really hard to one up those shows and their streaming competitors to be  the worst .
i follow you for a good while now and i was hoping you would talk about this. glad you discussed this woke trash
the best example of bringing back an old ip is cobra kai.it grew up with the audience  but kept the heart and soul
killin  it mama!
they come for optimus prime and we riot.
i suffer from anxiety and depression  i apparently have ptsd.  when you have an anxiety panic attack  you most definitely do not just lay there asking people to make you laugh.  these attacks temporarily upend your entire existence.
if that scoobi thing is true image the backlash that s coming
seems like mindy is under the delusion that s she s a  catch  --- as if guys want her
bigmouth is halarius and has awesome shock value where it is more cartoony and i mean doesnt try to be like real life or made for modern audiences
at this point  i think they realized that they are making way more money from rage baiting than from quality products... look how much trending potential they have  how much short videos  trailers and other material gets views. i think viewership doesn t matter anymore because they are banking on ad revenue.
it makes me mad because i watched the show and movies with my young children. they just want to crap on those memories.
velma is a tasteless modern take on satire.
i ran into my old high school church youth  group leader on sunday. haven t seen the guy since 2007. he works at playstation on game cinematics. he told me he worked on the horizon zero dawn as well as the dlc. i didn t ask if he d worked on forbidden west  but i would like to think he did. he apparently is also working on a few very-early-in-development projects for playstation. don t ask me what those are because i didn t ask my friend  so i have no idea.
we have all been saying it since this started....they want to normalize these things.
what s new scooby doo and scooby doo mystery incorporated are by far the best scooby doo series cuz the characters were likable  they retained the feel of the original 1969 series  and they were overall good shows. while velma on the other hand is just a slap in the face to not only the original series but all series that came before it due to how much they twist an warp the characters into unlikable jerks and making both norville  shaggy  and fred aka the only main male characters in the cast into punching bags for the rest of the cast especially fred.
i ve been trying for a week to hate watch velma but i can t make myself even do that.!.! it just feels like i m giving in to mindy if i watch
as far as shaggy goes  he is a veteran of the u.s. army  and during the vietnam conflict  and during the hippy 1960s  the green shirt is the sign  and not highlighted during the scooby doo shows .  he has the image of being a drug addict who lives in a van  shaggy was designed for saturday morning cartoons  so hanna-barbera substituted food for the thing  this made the dog scooby and shaggy best pals  in the food twist to make it watchable for children  in all entertainment  we see euphemisms and double entendre  because it isn t what you say  where world reality didn t go away  it is how you say it for your target audience.  what hbo max did to shaggy is a shame  he isn t stupid  he just has to deal with his food addiction  he has the mystery machine team friends  who look out for him  who are true friends and didn t shove him aside.
this was the creators of the show giving fans of the original series the middle finger. it s so extreme that it s not serious but intentionality trying to set off half decent people. how did the property holders of scooby-doo allowed this to happen  at this point  we re seeing the powerful in media not care if they sink their properties. they are as passionate or even more passionate about their cause than many christians. and that s a big problem.
they have to take beloved ips because their stories and characters cannot stand on their own merit.
maybe a update video on the stalker guy  that sht was wild
how so  they re the ones creating the ads and paying for them to be aired. the only one gaining from all the criticism  assuming it doesn t earn hbo more subscribers  is youtube.
@user-gy1yk7fo6x  well... look at the trailers for exemple  it s on their channel... so the millions of views are on their channel...i mean  i m speculating for sure  but this doesn t add up... no one would keep pumping content with abysmal views  abysmal reviews  if there wasn t a payoff somewhere. we ve been bombarded with crap for several years now. someone  somewhere would be tired of paying for it if there wasn t a payday
i hereby propose we refer to this sort of ip sabotage as  spitewashing  make it happen everybody
shaggy was really loveable and many female characters were attracted to shaggy through various versions. shaggy was never someone who would simp for anyone. he would only simp for food and he would put his dog the best character who isn t even in this show  before any love interest. they did him dirty. velma was nerdy  smart  clumsy  cute  kind in all the versions of scooby doo so i refuse to call the character here velma. this is mindy trying to cosplay velma. fred was a chad who loved traps actual traps  not cultural traps  and he came with the plans  he has never been a stupid incompetent racist jerk. daphne is a hot and kind girl who in some versions is a badass martial artist  and though she may not be as intelligent as velma she is still a really smart character. she was also a lock picker but she definitely never was a cheater. she would never cheat on fred  if she weren t happy with the relationship she was strong enough to end it instead of cheating. they even insult the mystery machine.
i said it when it was first revealed. they removed scooby-doo...no one is safe
failure is a bend in the road  not the end of the road. learn from failure and keep moving forward.
this abortion has inspired me to produce a mindy kaling biopic with ron jeremy in the title role.
you know  something i noticed with velma is something i ve noticed with she-hulk as well...if you showed the show to people  and you told them the writer s  was a shut-in incel nerd -- how many people would believe it  before they saw that the show s  were written by women like  if i described to you a show that paints all women as petty  vindictive  shallow  and easy while also painting just about all men as equally shallow  stupid  and thuggish  what image is conjured of the writer  to my mind  i picture the angry incel. a furious man-child who can t get laid  and has been made the fool of by more well adjusted men.it s so strange to see these shows and say  this is exactly what r incel and r mgtow look like  this is their views  verbatim  being televised to me... only to discover these arent written by men at all. they re written almost entirely and exclusively  by women.i m not a woman  i wouldn t know  but i would like to know how many women genuinely hate women  as much as these female showrunners hate women  because  believe me  these characters are written with the same brush as the one used by women-haters to disparage women.
the difference is that big mouth has decent writing and it s actually funny in parts.
i thought hanna barbera explicitly did not give them permission to use scooby-doo.
i ve completely stopped watching modern day content  it s so bad i now ignore 95  of everything   just watch old stuff now. and even though the content is 20-30 years old it most definitely stands out against the rubbish we have now.
that cat definitely wanted to be in the video lol
this show is like if the writers of drawn together suddenly got woke and decided to remake scooby doo.
back in my day this would ve never been even greenlit.
my brother has had a bad case of hateallhumanitis all his life.
does anyone remember when the scooby gang  renamed the groovy gang for copyright purposes  appeared on  the venture brothers    that s how you do an  adult  version of scooby-doo.
long story short  hbo spent millions of dollars animating and advertising a self insert fan fic. it s twilight all over again
reminds me of howard stern  his rating were driven up by people hate listening to him which fuelled his success.
listens to the what s new scooby doo  theme song to wash the taste out of my mouth
velma   omg i hate ur daughter and her friends also velma thumbnailwhat a dumb trope  what a dumb show
i did my part and watched the first episodes  painfully  after telling someone it was getting horrible reviews and they loved it. omg! this show was so bad. i think i half chuckled at one part but watched the whole episode and i was quiet the whole time. what s worse is that i kept checking how much time was left  and it would have so much more to go which meant it was so unwatchable it made the episode pass slowly. usually something that is entertaining will seem short when it s good. i went back to the person who liked it and found out they were high on weed when they watched it.
maybe if we put them in the same outfits we can get fans to tune in so we can trash them
damn that show was so good
@acolyteofdagon8670  it was good at being controversial and pushing the limits of taste  but i wouldn t say it was good overall. the premise was unique though.
@mkygod  i enjoyed it
i have never seen a video from this channel  but that cat and i are in love with each other  even if though we haven t met.
venture brothers did a better mature and dark scooby doo crew for one episode and that was enough. it didn t overstay it s welcome. and it was done in 2006. and puss and boots the last wish had no right being as good as it was or making death such a badass villain.
scooby doo loved it in the 60s when i was a kid i also had a crush on velma   good grief these people r crazy dudes
you know why nobody was complaining about race swapping comissioner gordon in the new batman movie because it was good.
oh yeah btw  shaggy s dad in here looks more like shaggy than this shaggy ever will
it doesn t even deserve to be called velma. it should be called mindy because it s just a self insert series stomping on the legacy of more talented writers and characters
god bless you for being able to stomach watching this heresy   my gut told me not to watch  and it never leads me astray lol
her name isnt scoobi y  but it appears she will be taking the place scooby
i m convinced that mindy kaling just hates scooby doo with a passion.
yes  i did watched this just to see how bad it was going be. wanted to form my own opinion on this before watching anyone else talk about how horrible this was.
this and avatar have shown hollywood s weird  odd obsession with 15 year olds in their birthday suits. so odd.
so  an extra-dark nubian queen is the replacement for the giant brown dog. interesting decision.
supposedly there is a new character called scoobi  with an i   in the 2ed season if rumors are true.... shes a girl who is supposedly scooby doos namesake
brace yourselves...   velma   is the precursor to phase 5 of the mcu.
we thought scooby-doo would die a hero. unfortunatlely it lived long enough to become the villian.
gen x weighing in  i was in the original audience on saturday mornings. none of this stuff would ve registered with me  like the shaggy stoner thing. we never thought about stuff like this  or sexuality other than getting that daphne was supposed to be hot. btw velma was the smart one not shaggy.
the body shaming of fred was disgusting
looks at thumbnail oh  this is gonna be good.
all i can say is  rotten tomatoes at this time velma 6 puss in boots the last wish 93 total  99 i m pretty sure puss will pickup that 1  undecided by tomorrow.
i had to watch scooby-natural to cleans the stink of velma off of me.
or nick fury. because the character was written well  and samuel l is a great actor.
@ladyamalthea0615  also an excellent example.
how so
well  scooby-doo probably died a hero...it s just that his owner and his owner s friends... uh... were not so lucky.
do people keep forgetting total drama island also showed underage nudity  the context of them censoring it was clever for them being on television but the general thought  still stands they got away with it and nobody seem to complain about it back then.
hi melonie i hope your doing well.i ve haven t been anyinterested on seeing the newvelma. your awesome bringing these topics out with most others won t .takecare melonie
you are right on the money! thank you !
i feel like making a deadpool joke out of this show.  imagine deadpool going on a rampage asking for scooby  the dog instead of francis.
i am simple man. i see cat in background  i hit subscribe for more
in the original show the town they came from was  coolsville   in this show isn t it  poortown    i m not watching this show either and i m wondering  does velma say  jinkies  at all
velma needs to switch to carnivore urgently
how do you not have a million subscribers
imagine  creating  an entire show where 100  of the content demonstrates the creator is guilty of all the things they are saying are bad habits etc it s basically velma but whatever a female version of an incel is.
just watch mystery inc if you need some eye bleach to forget this show exists. its an example of an actual scooby doo show
the narcissism of mindy kaling  having to be the lead role in everything she produces writes  is insanity. how does she keep getting these gigs..it s awful.
when mischievous people of immoral background get into places of institution  education and power  we didn t see the results of their works as everything turns to shit because there was always a hidden agenda behind what they were working on to begin with!these are people with an ax to grind and hate and resentment in their heart..
damn it big companies  stop f ing up our childhoods!
i ve given up on any major studio tv and movies. i go to the early 2000s and later to watch the good stuff. and a lot of newer b movies are superb to tv and movies made for the  modern audience .
so i have a question about the show. aren t these people supposed to be friends
don t ever compare this to the new puss   boots is a future classic velma is just an insight of how woman really think
the monster is hbo max  had me dying omg
i guess that isn t scooby but some character from daphne s group names gigi or something. with that that said  this is easily one of the worst button shows i have seen in such a long time. i almost feel like warner brothers discovery didn t cancel it  so they can tout this off as  look how bad animation is  we re not going to focus on it anymore.i watched one episode  and that. the first line you here is   and it starts with a mystery  bitch ! and the first thing you see are cockroaches humping each other. i d be impressed if anybody made it over the 2 minute mark.
how come people only accept cartoon nudity on screen if it s a male  but if it s cartoon nudity on a female people feel like they have to complain   i don t understand why both were never treated equally on criticism of nudity!do people keep forgetting about total drama island from 2007  everyone remembers the heather scene. yet nobody never complained about it i m just beyond confused
that show was aimed for teens mostly. this show is aimed for adults. bit of a difference
@jayharv285  underage nudity is underage nudity
@delix787  again target audience is a bit different. one is worse than the other.
@jayharv285  you can have underage nudity in both audience perspectives   you can have nudity in an adult cartoon  and a child cartoon. shows like family guy get away with this stuff all the time so i don t really understand your argument  chris is like 15 yet he s been naked many times in the show and he s a minor in an adult cartoon  and a show like 6teen with teenagers that were under age and naked all the time  and that cartoon was targeted for kids. so no!! underage nudity has been in both kids cartoons and adult cartoons and it s still the same minor logic
that show was aimed for teens  don t care what people say it was for teens  this is a show aimed for adults. bit of a difference
so... i ve read a cbr article stating that the velma show has the best version of shaggy... yeah...
i m glad will and joe didn t live to see the abomination the scooby doo ip has become.
i tried pronouncing dinkley with an indian accent.
og shaggy use 0000.4  of his powers to see into the future. he saw the bs  than he took his old pay scooby with him and left.
he has a green shirt  he s shaggy!
it s clear that mindy kaling does not really know or care who velma is as a character beyond  the smart chick . and that s just what she thinks of herself as  despite being a mediocre writer and profoundly unfunny  so that s why she wrote literally herself as velma.
the lady in charge is just a really concerning person and would not allow her near my children.
scoobi isn t the dog turned girl.scoobi will be a murder victim and norville will name a dog after her.it s gonna be an unearned sentimental statement in a show where all the characters treat each other like shit
i m wondering if they meant for this show to be bad on purpose.
i decided to look up a video from like three years ago on gamespot tv because i had never seen a clip  so i hadn t seen melonie besides on this channel...it s so weird  she looks so different. like a different person. like she has straight hair  but that s not it  her face is like different. melonie  explain...are you a shapeshifter or something
i m really creeped out about artists and showrunners creating cartoons about teenagers doing sexual acts and talking about how great orgies are. these people seem to love sexualizing minors. it s weird that nobody has investigated them. does anyone remember nickelodeon s dan schnider who abused teen girls from zoey 101 to icarly
wait  the re told of a series is to fix the  problems  of old    didnt know that.
shaggy was always a beta  but he wasn t a simp.
will the destruction of our childhood ever end
the amount of hate towards fred make me believe the creator has a personal issue with a specific white male person in real life
fred  and the real culprit is pulls off hbo max s maskeveryone  george soros ! george soros  yeah  and i would have gotten away with it too  if it weren t for you meddling kids.
i would never watch the show to begin with but now i might check it out so i can make fun of it
scooby doo is an ip that should have never been taken in that direction. at its core its been a family show. they have done more serious takes but it s still a family show. the only thing that would save the show is at the end ashton kutcher comes and a says you just got punked.
here s a theory. hollywood makes a horrible spin off of beloved shows like scooby-doo so when they make another reboot with a race swap people praise it for saying see this is how you do it right unlike velma.
for casey kasem is rolling in his grave  but i doubt they even know who he is.
yes  they did. right now the only thing hollywood does is recycle ips. you make a good show that last five years  that s only one ip relicensing. you make five shitty shows that last one year each  that s five relicensings.
it was a change in diet! she was vegan  but that diet did her no good. she s 36 now  but at most looks mid 20s.
@rey lopez  ah  i see...i suppose that could do it lol now she s straight nomin  dem animalz and gettin  gainz with that  carnivore  diet  since i ve heard her mention that a few times. she s stickin  it to the  vegan man  or the  soy boy   to be scientifically accurate.
having love interests in stories that primarily feature minors is fine. back when it was displayed in a more innocent  puppy love  manner  it was relatable to kids and even teenagers  still kids  without going too far.the problem with this is that it  as mentioned  oversexualizes characters who aren t even old enough to drink. hell  they re barely old enough to drive a motor vehicle.  while this is  sadly  is still relatable to today s kids  namely teens  it s sending the wrong message  seemingly trying to reinforce normalizing kids behaving in sexual ways.
it s like they crap on your plate and tell you it s chocolate
i can t exactly criticize on this matter  with the sheer amount of japanese manga  anime  and games i enjoy that  sexualize minors . thing is  though  the people who make and defend crap like this are also usually the ones who constantly throw flak at japan for doing the same thing  to the point of racism.it s the typical  rules for thee  but not for me  behavior that this out-of-touch new aristocracy constantly upholds.
i don t get how shows like this get greenlit... really  hollywood s full of perverts  that we know  but nowadays it s full of slow people because there s no way in hell a show like this would be successful!
just gonna put this out there.scooby doo  mystery incorporated was a more faithful  respectful and mature show than hbo s velma...
i actually like the 2 vids you showed. do we need more shaggy and scooby     really. flesh out velma and shaggy. i think that is a good idea. so velma is playing hard to get as a teen. don t teen girls form group anyways to bond and make distance. seriously   youth males are at peak testosterone with no support money. teen girls need the protection.
this just proves the show makers shouldnt have been allowed to make the show  let alone to even be near minors  cause yikes
i heard that mindy wanted to make a separate project  but hbo wouldn t pick it up unless it was tied to some previous brand.  so they picked scooby-doo doo and ended up with this trash.  don t get me wrong  it would have been trash either way.
it s basically like painted faces that isn t allowed on entertainment now.
best chick youtuber ever!
to create new character s would require them to be more  than   uninspired  untalented  unimaginative  hack s
these characters broke into the homes of the scooby gang and stole their clothes.
hollywood has always supported the sexualization of high schoolers. actors are in their late 20s and 30s playing 16yo and they re performing suggestible acts. and it has only gotten more blatant the last decade and animation has given them a huge gateway to more debauchery.
you know  you could just not acknowledge that it exists. like what i m doing
jeez not to brag but i m glad i m genx and when i was a teen they hadn t yet devised wokeism.. maybe this is good in a way being knowing there s now an evidently crappy version it makes the original show perhaps even more appreciated!
the writers naming a woman  scoobi is bad but i bet they will have her with a 4-year-old son named scrappy dew!
the message  dies hard...
this show is for adults! proceeds to write jokes that adults dont find funny
the more i hear about this show the more i think they made this show horrible on purpose for the publicity. the main reason i think that is because it doesnt even really appeal to the  woke  audience in some cases either. or i could be totally wrong and the writing in hollywood could just be this bad now... i guess thats what we get for our horrible school systems.
as a dog lover i m offended most by the exclusion of scooby.
every seems to over look that soon people will call velma cosplays racist since they race swapped her in this show. it s a never ending cycle
i ve always wanted an adult scooby-do kinda show but this is just disgusting!
better off watching the original 1969 tv show as well as the scooby-doo movies and the scooby and scrappy doo show. at least fred and daphne are still the same color and race.
and the dumb people who hate watch things instead of ignoring it and watching something good is why it s gotten a season 2 cause all these companies care about is views and not bad reviews.
these are the same people who call the f b freaking i over people liking japanese animations but they ll plunge their heads in their back ends to defend this  don t get me started on them bringing in a sistah for norvells love interest by the name of scoobi.no freaking shot  it s no joke like they re calling a bl ack woman a dog
watch scooby doo mystery incorporated if you want a modern  self aware scooby doo show that is actually quality
just remember this  the only thing worse than being racist is pretending not to be. this whole show is such a tell!
i disagree with you when you say this isn t even woke done right  it s woke done so poorly that it s absurd  divisive   its incredibly prejudice  spiteful nature is laid bare for all to see. they wear the things you love like a skinsuit.in that sense i m glad it s getting the attention it is   mindy will soon learn why people come to regret pursuing negative pr
don t watch the show. it s so simple. i don t doubt they made it terrible on purpose just to have people  hate watch  it.
i think chewing glass world be less painful than watching this. who is this for  what s next  a simpsons reboot where bart is gender-identified as a toaster strudel with unicorn sprinkles
does melonie has a gaming channel  been on the search for a female gaming channel that is based like melonie since there is a lot of woke female gaming channels.
preach sister!
i could do nothing but laugh upon finding out they made scoob a black woman. i hope that meteor actually hits us.
what else would you expect from woke
only positive is that scooby is not part of this that was a close call it will be an insult to dogs and for them to say he was just for kids these people never watched it are baggage hunters
shaggy needs to say zoinks!velma needs to jay jinkies making scooby a black woman  now that s an all time low.
first off yeah the velma show sucks so bad it s as bad as she hulk and high guardian spice or worse. but to me i find it funny when people say they re minor been teenagers and all when if u watch anime like 60  of all the characters are teens and there s fan service and not a lot of people say anything about that.i m sure it s only like that cus anime hasn t been huge before until the past 10-20 years where it s now a main stream here in the us and with someone like me who s been watching anime for 20  years  fan service is basically like whatever. however if it s someone who doesn t watch anime then i can completely understand why they re calling that out. i m not just saying this for this one show but for the rest of the adult american cartoons that has stuff like that.oh and as for  scoobi  the latest news is that she isn t  scoobi  and someone else  but we won t know until the next episode
when i saw it   i felt like that matrix woman  not like this  not like this
the problem i have with this is the fact that these are underage children. my daughter is 14  and in high school  and all she thinks about is getting good grades and healthy friendships. even though in her school 74  of kids identify with something other than but this show set a presence of what they are pushing for kids to do. drug dealing  same-sex and multiple-sex partners  bullying  glorifying mental illness  etc  etc. it s sick  it s pedophilia  and it s truly sad and disgusting. why the kids    i just can t anymore
she has a twitch  but hasn t streamed a ton lately. she was planning to do more again  soon.
another case of taking a beloved show that didn t needed to be changed and making a show that didn t need to be made and changing it for a modern audience. i watched the 2 episodes  and i cannot believe how they butchered the characters and if we are talking about not comparing the characters to their other versions in media the show is not funny there were two instances where i chuckled then they ruined it.
they literally made scooby-doo into a bitch.
for some reason this video came up in a section for  bloodborne  in my feed. it was just there in a row of soulsborne videos. this series must be that punishing to watch that youtube put it in inbetween videos bloodborne and dark souls
i bet the  girls  is going to have a  m nage   trois
this is very  very bad for warner! why can t they just focus on making something good like the new season of night court on nbc instead! the season premiere got the best premiere ratings for a sitcom on nbc in nearly five years  breaking a huge record there and the best premiere ratings for sitcom since the conners roseanne spinoff dropped in 2018 on abc. that s incredible  and it seems as if that show is doing far better than this show velma on hbo max in terms of ratings right now!
venture bros. did a 20x better job portraying the mystery gang  hell even family guy did a better job regardless it being a quick segment but i digress.
i kinda like the new show .you just have to watch it without thinking about the scooby doo show
just because the boys or rick and morty are successful doesn t mean that everything has to be edgy mature hardcore destruction mockery of archetypes and established characters.
it s so bad they body shamed fred s genitals when guys have committed suicide in the past over their sexual anxieties and self worth   these writers seem pure evil.
aside from uniting the world in hating the show itself  the only good thing that will come out of this show is the pitch meeting.
this is nothing but a big steaming pile of woke scooby doo-doo.
2 20-2 33 basically rwby after monty passed away
velma is getting math answers from shaggy  so they made her stupider than shaggy  oh and a cheater who laughs at other people s pain. hope to god nobody ever says the word  flintstones  around the creators. i don t want to see fred and barney make their bed rock!
how have i never found this account. happy to subscribe now!
you know  this abominable show is basically the controversial photo of kathy griffin holding up trump s decapitated head moment in a nutshell  only it s mindy kaling holding the severed craniums of each respective member of mystery inc with a smug grin on her face. what. the. actual. hell.
personally i refuse to watch this not just to not give hbo the wrong impression that is successful but for what they ve done to the mystery inc is just insulting. from the clips you showed  velma asking shaggy for answers for her homework would like jimmy newton asking sheen for answers for science class  and from what i heard they do to fred it just comes off as people who have nothing but hate contempt for scooby-doo ip. i wonder why this got the greenlight did mindy have such a good contract that not showing it would cost them more then showing it
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin good forces have invented or made
i would ve been happy to see another adaptation of the classic scooby doo  all the while respecting the source material! i will happily pass on this bastardizing dumpster fire of a show!
disney  i have made the most woke and unwatchable trash ever!amazon  no  i have made the worst ever!hbo  hold my beer
happy tuesday melonie! melonie you should compete for miss universe
mari is getting a lot of abuse over her tweets people really suck.
i am never going to watch velma because i don t want them to get the satisfactory that they had this many views so they can get paid. i don t want that and when you said puss in boots the last wish how great it is. it is fantastic definitely watch it if you guys haven t watched it yet.
how can you possibly make every character in a show unlikeable that s what i don t get lmao. like people literally got paid to make a show where all the characters are garbage xd.
who seriously wanted this show edit  hold on. so  scooby  is in this show
it is still beyond comprehension how norville is attracted to velma in this series. she literally has no redeeming traits  neither in looks  nor personality  nor actions  like nothing.it is so ironic how mindy kaling wants us to identify with velma and see her as a progressive anti-racist woman  when she is literally racist against every kind of white character in the show and doesn t stop there. she bullies every single character in the show and acts extremely entitled. this is not velma dinkley bro.this show is literally a fanfic. i swear. if someone wrote this on wattpad or ao3 or any fanfic site i swear it will look like an original ip to people who don t know about this show.
when your show makes she-hulk look better call saul good by comparison  you should probably fire the executives on the project  and cancel mindy kaling for her self-insert disaster
they just want to anger the fan s its pretty simple
there ain t enough everclear in the world to make me sit down and watch this crap.
i just don t get it  it s why i m still a virgin
velma show is without a doubt worse than she-hulk.wow! that s an amazing accomplishment .
the only credit i ll give mindy kailing is a long  enduring congratulations for doing what was seemingly unachievable  she made a show that rates even worse than that garbage movie  dragonball evolution . say what you want about that terrible movie  at least their was a semblance of familiarity to the show even if it was completely bastardized. velma however  can t even get that much right.
cuties just in cartoon form. they forgot to put the latex suited gimp teddy bears in those shower scenes.
hollywood hijacking established and well liked ip and adapting them for the modern audience is the ultimate click bait.  they know no one will watch their original shows with unoriginal ideas so they leverage nostalgia for shows like he-man  scooby doo  lord of the rings  she-hulk to create their modern shows that like our good friends the rinos  are the original ip in name only.  gives new meaning to the term hollybroke  and not just financially broke  but spiritually and morally.
the scoobi things is a rumor that s going around. hoping it s just that
instead of ruining everything  why don t the big wigs just allow them to make a new daria cartoon. they can have daria. we can have stuff intended to make money by being good.
i m okay with shipping characters and fanfiction  but to a certain extent. this just f  ked up! also  the whole thing with velma liking daphne was most just a really dumb joke among scooby-doo fans  these people not only took too seriously but way too far to the point of the disturbing!!!
they re not minors. they re cartoons. but i get what you re saying.
cartoons of minors doing things of this nature -  believe it or not is not against the law.  scotus already said cartoons can not be cp.  even though its gross  its not illegal.  if it were illegal the entire japanese anime contruct would be shut down in the usa.
agreed sister
this show is actually just freds backstory. fred is the only character from the scoobi doo movies and shows and all the other characters are barely similar or not at all. so later in life after school fred will finally meet up with the scoobi gang that we know and love and this show is just what horrible crap happened to him before that.
i ve heard about cuties and the controversy surrounding it. it sounds gross if you ask me.
just like every crap show in the last couple of years  you can see the main  female  character is actually the villain of the show  every action they make is related to what a villain would do  not a hero  then  when we point it out  of course the show creator lashes out  and blame the fans...ugh...
well luckily you can get scooby-doo on dvd and just avoid this show all together
can t wait for your last of us video
shame you can t even let your kids watch scooby doo anymore. xd
ya know  i get it.shipping together is fun and all but  if stories are worse because of it whats the point of shipping...also they are underage!this is not appropriate...also  velma feels like such a horrible person  meanwhile norville is like  i like you. then her response is  nah you dont like me  thats funny  your like my bro do you know how terrible norville would feel if he was a real guy  he would be devestated.i just hate how most new shows are about insufferable characters  with no emotions that function correctly.i thought velma was the silent shy nerd  and her friend group mad her feel confident because they knew she knew her stuff.now shes just an insufferable woman  and i dont understand why shes such a terrible person.
i think the comparisons the show itself makes to riverdale are rather fitting. both are hideous perversions of the relatively innocent and innocuous source material that make liberal use of the californian stereotype that the only things teens think about are sex  drugs  alcohol  and partying. all made by writers seeming to get off on grown adults acting like this...i hate hollywood.
if it is a self-portrait of themselves and a projection of what we are to them. these people are totally psychically damaged.
whats truly ironic is that mindy kaling is the definition of a privileged upbringing...
can t believe this is the same network that brought us the last of us.
to be fair  shaggy was always a beta male.  but this new  shaggy  is still an injustice.
she hulk is worse because the original content is so good.  rings of power is 1000 times worse because the source material is literally legendary. i enjoyed scooby do as a kid but i never heard of a rabid scooby do fan base in my life. but ya overall how they have to put this stuff in everything is insane.
why does she need  shaggy  to email math answers to velma  isn t velma smarter than shaggy  as a female  isn t it insulting for her to be automatically bad at math  is  shaggy  mansplaning math to velma who the hell writes this !
i gotta admit it is a complete dumpster fire i wouldn t call it.   woke.  i d call it trash ... it s as if they had an idea for a show but got distracted and slaped the name   velma   on it . oddly enough    laughing at peoples emotions   that is something that i find akin to the right and far right   etc
someone should check mindys basement for children
woke writers don t create new characters because their goal is the replacement and or destruction of existing characters and storylines.
hollywood stopped making films and series for the audiences and fans of these franchises  and instead only makes films and series for themselves  the calarts  silicon valley  narcissistic hollywood gender bender weirdos  that is what it means for shows to be  reimagined for  modern audiences .
until the day i die i shall refuse to acknowledge that this show  this sacrilege has anything to do with scooby doo
wokeness is not about acceptance  it s about hating the right people
actually! her name might not be scoobiits potentially actually gigi
can we all stop clutching our pearls about the  zomg they re minors!  thing  not only is it a massive virtue signal  but it detracts from the million-and-one other things we can justifiably rip into the show for. face facts  high schoolers date  kiss and occasionally screw in real life. nobody ever seemed to have a problem with fictional depictions of that fact whenever it was live action high schoolers  buffy et al.   so i don t know why it s suddenly a problem now that it s animated. either be consistent or pipe down about it.
riverdale  is so bad it s laughable. velma  is so bad it s offensive.
in the interest of equality and inclusion  if you were to reverse the gender roles here and have the guys trying to pressure girls into having sex or men making fun of how loose her vagina is - would that be tolerated and acceptable if not why are the female characters in this cartoon allowed to do that to the males
i never knew there were south asian gingers.
this is what morally bankrupt looks like  being so obsessed with politics that the writers of this show have actually surpassed the cartoon villains in utter malevolence
makes you wonder about the scooby snacks
bigmouth is good tho!
shaggy and rule 34  female scoobi  should be kept as creepy pr0n fanart or an internet joke  not an actual pairing in any iteration of the scooby-doo franchise. frickin  weirdos.
at least the last of us show is off to a good start
they are trying to make themselves look better by putting men down through fred. and the funny thing is any observer can tell that the writers are awful human beings.  fred is useless  he can t even cook. he is a man but looks like a child...  zzz. they really saw an opportunity to bash men and advance their agenda with  velma   didn t they  you have to be a self-absorbed femi-na zi to appreciate this. while just about anyone could appreciate the original scooby doo.
how are they minors  surely they re about 70 now.
thanks for keeping crap like this to light melonie!  you know it s bad when it beats out dragonball evolution for the worst rating ever.
i finally realized why i won t want this show. this is not scooby doo this is mindy s show. this is mindy having herself play scooby doo characters. it s bad when jay and silent bob has a better scooby doo satire.
good grief its like watching hellraiser dudes this show is creepy
we need a conservative hollywood. not in hollywood. a place that can create movies and shows that aren t crap. that aren t woke af. that are focused not on politics but story telling and entertainment.
grtz melonie on 105k
judging from the clips you showed  i don t think this was ever supposed to be a  reboot . looks more like an edgy ridiculous shock value show made to generate this type of controversy. mindy kaling did write for the office  so maybe in that vain of  shock  humor
it s almost as if this show is an anti-woke parody of what a scooby doo spinoff would be. all the tropes are so on-the-nose.
velma is mindy s hatefic.
at least fan-fiction writers call their works fan-fiction and don t claim to be official new canon  these woke tv movie writers are audacious to put mildly...
what kind of mindset is mindy operating on
never was a fan of the original  the movies based on the original  or the reboots. however  hearing how terrible this is makes me want to support everything prior to this garbage.
if your cat 0 07 isn t pregnant  you need to take it to the gym with you.
is it just me or has anyone else made a bitch joke about scooby and making the great dane dog a human is wack
3 57  no one likes me!  could it be because you treat everyone around you like garbage
wait so let me get this strait. the show velma is calling a black woman a dog  wow. thats so horrible. i feel sorry for any content creator and thankful at the same time  that watched this show so i didnt have to. the ones who watched velma so i didnt have to are the real heros here. so thank you.
i ve never seen an episode of velma and thankfully i m not going to from what i ve seen of it  i d rather remember the vintage scooby and gang  not this freakish trash. and yes i loved puss in boots the last wish
a lot of hbo is garage.... velma actually fits into the agenda to make the whole company fail.
changing scooby doo into a person for this poor excuse of a show really is cruelty to animals.
evil will not stop itself and talk does nothing
who said velma was trying to  fix  anything  how can you review a show that you haven t seen does this mean all raunchy teen comedies are  abominations   is it just the lesbian angle you re angry about  does that mean rowling is  gross  because she shipped ron and hermione  what are you even trying to say at this point
literally this show feels like a bunch of progressive writers got together to throw a bunch of lefty talking points in a bowl and threw darts at a bunch of different ips and landed on scooby-doo as the method of delivery. the characters have nothing to do with the source material past the most superfluous traits
i haven t watched it. wasn t even interested in the show. if i wanted to watch scooby-doo  i would watch the original show. but from what i hear  this show makes scooby-doo and scrabby show look like a master piece.
now i ve got nothing wrong with pedo jokes but there s a way of writing them that makes them clearly a funny joke and  not at all suspicious  but this show literally feels like it s been written by idiots with pedophilic fantasies who try so hard to be antifacist that they end up being incredibly racist. part of me hopes that they do carry this on for a second season just to see how deep of a hole they can dig for themselves.
and yet it somehow got a second season. uh...sure
these people should be ashamed of desecrating a poor innocent ip like scooby doo. is nothing safe anymore  whats next  what kind of horror show could they do with the smurfs
i just realized that this norville character disrespecting shaggy being a beta male simp where shaggy rodgers is a chad. he gets the most women and don t even need to chase them.
yeah as a black guy  imma just say everything this girl said was a 100  true! i could understand a few straight white guy jokes but when it s happening every single second  it just sounds stupid! i just wanna see what would happen if this show made black men the butt of the joke too. twitter would go fkn mad! tbh this sad writer just made a show about her sad sad life and decided to use velma as a way smh!
1. the star wars xmas special has a higher audience score2. scooby should be a twelve yr old in a dog mask because he identifies as a dog.3. star wars xmas special4. no one anywhere in the history of time has ever wanted an origin story of a pair of glasses. ever. it s such a stupid idea. how about making her poor eyesight part of her ignorance  nah. she knows everything  errrr  she is wrong about everything.5. star wars xmas special.
they cancelled scoob 2 for this
my lecturer used to say  there is no racism against white people but xenophobia . i totally disagree. velma proves there is.
thanks for the video. i have no interest in this trash show and the ruining of these iconic characters. the whole shower scene you brought up is nothing new in r-rated films or shows centered around teens. the  sexualizing minors  is something i find laughable whenever they have their clinch the pearls over hand-drawn characters. we have teen shows with sexualized elements like the original gossip girl  riverdale  and the more adult show sex education on netflix. anime does a lot of fanservice with their female characters and some of their male characters depending on the age range of the show. i am not against anyone that feels uncomfortable with these scenarios and at the same  i won t tolerate anyone who shames someone who doesn t have a problem with these kinds of scenes either.
there is a video about this by uper echelon. really worth a watch
soeaking of shagy being a beta simp. aperently theought the films and old content. he was the one gals fell for for the shier comady of him only caring about food and being oblivius.it was a funny gag
scooby .with an i
you flustered goobers are so dramatic. i love it. stay outraged
still better than wednesday  change my mind
thinly-veiled  favourers of the playground  animation is becoming more and more commonplace nowadays. i would have said i m sadden by this before but now i m just downright pissed
so we ve gone from virtue signalling to allowing just straight-out racism and call it whatever they are calling it now yet it s exactly the same thing and do we really think it s getting better. do a 360 and switch it right on around and tell me what the hell is the difference. so hypocritical is just ridiculous  if it wasn t so sad it would be funny  because in anybody s heart of hearts i don t care who it is  unless they re so wicked hearted that they re that far gone  they know it s the truth. it s a damn cartoon for goodness sakes it s supposed to be light-hearted and fun while they have to ruin every damn thing for their political and or personal agendas just really f     sucks you just can t watch anything anymore without them ruining it. the powers-that-be of high in the media entertainment and everywhere are just so scared that some little snowflakes are going to melt that they re single-handedly destroying entertainment as an art form altogether. it s just going to all together disappear if all they re ever going to worry about is the 1  and then basically just censor the other ninety-nine  they are going to go downhill really fast as we re seeing right now if we are paying attention and it s obvious a whole lot of people aren t   it s just really f     ridiculous...... end quote!!
the only good thing about this show  is the fact that it s 100  going to get canceled by the end of season 1
well  not only is velma an abomination  sin in general is an abomination. and this show is clearly embracing the devil s things. but as much as i hate all of these woke products  i have to keep in mind  that these are man made things. things made by man will eventually fall apart or fade away. what is important is what god made. the eternal and pure. imo  as long as we have faith  worship and love the lord  as long as we can still read the bible then there is still hope. without the lord  what would life be  i know that those who aren t christian aren t going to agree with me  but this is what i will stick with. and i don t want to turn my back on this. jesus is the way  the truth  and the life.
bwahahaha.   in your quest to hate the show and issue  you helped make it the most watched.  negative views vs millions of haters taking time out of their lives to watch a program you don t like.   i think hbo and  velma  thanks you and others.  in being against the show you all have  whether it s a minute or the whole show  gave it streaming views.focused on hating  instead of ignoring the show. velma premiere is hbo max s most-watched animated original show by lukas shayo published 2 minutes ago despite the backlash  the velma premiere made the scooby doo spin-off hbo max s most-watched animated original show in the history of the platform.
remember the outcry over anime girls because it was sexualizing girls that were supposedly underage which they weren t.  where is the outcry here.
it s truly trash  and i only saw 90 seconds of it.  my wife made the mistake of assuming that a  scooby  show would be appropriate for our 6 1 2 and 2 1 2 year old daughters. she walked out of the room  and thankfully i stayed with the girls long enough to see the naked locker room violence  at which point i switched it to original episodes of  scooby-doo  where are you  .this is literally bordering on child pornography  and anyone who was associated with it s creation  or its  actually being greenlit  should be straight up ashamed.  like  do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth kinda  shame..!hbo has long pushed the pc   woke envelope further than most  bit even by their standards this is low.   what s worse  is pulling this with an ip that so many of us really enjoyed as kids  i was born in 1979  like me watching re-runs.  i just hope when they go after the goonies  or back to the future  or sixteen candles  that ya ll get up out your seats and go raise some hell.  eventually  the holly-wierdo s are gonna  have to respond to 10 s of millions of fans they have alienated from literally every  universe  they could get their greasy-social-warrior gaunlets on...this utter garbage is just the latest in a long line of actual  cultural appropriation  that lib-tards like kahling   co. just can t see for the 111  hypocrisy that it is.  dontvelmamychildhood.
thats a chonky cat in the background xd
this isn t shocking. woke hollywood is racist. one prime example is finn is the disney star wars. the main black lead is a comedic joke of a character  and his job as a stormtrooper was janitorial duties. really  that couldn t be more stereotypical. what was lando in the ot  a colony leader and a rebel general  not to mention the main hero in the battle of endor . and that was back in the 80 s.
we like stifler but we know he s an a  hole. and neither does the movie portray him as someone we should be rooting for. are we supposed to care about velma getting her comeuppance against whatever she s pissed about  definitely a personal hang-up of the writer and not within character of the original ip. the fact no one would ve cared for this if you didn t stoke nostalgia is blatant disrespect and hubris that breaks the very fabric of space time. from the needless race swapping to kindergarten puppet show level humor. it will be cathartic to see this fail miserably
rip scooby doo
remember when melonie mac used to talk about gaming and nerd culture in a positive light  pepperidge farm remembers. remember when melanie mac lied about her stalker  pepperidge farm remembers. remember how intelligent melanie mac was  pepperidge fram doesn t remember.
shipping culture is so weird to me.they do it with real people too in kpop which is even weirder..this world is going down in flames
nah  you can t be for real on she-hulk. as much as nerds like to praise john byrne s run while the show was running i read as many she-hulk comics as i could and the show was better than most of the stuff i read including a good portion of the john byrne run. the circus thing was weird and bad and while dwayne mcduffie will always be an icon his she-hulk was bland and forgettable. parts of the dan slott run weren t that good either. overall  great but not all of it was. the show was better than a lot of what i read.
japanese anime manga put children in questionable situations all the time  key differences  it is always individual intellectual property   properly rated for mature age groups  always pushes male female to inspire the creation of the next generation while showing proper shame  humilty  respect in such situations of  accidental fan service  85   of the time-- unless it was created for the express purpose of being horrifying and our lack of ethics is even negatively effecting japanese content as it has started to slide down the ethical scale in the past 10 years of global cultural interaction.as for velma... no. this exists so that brain sick madness ridden men   women can perpetuate the most destructive methodology possible  to break down civilization and rebuild it on more marxist foundations. those questionable scenes were 100  from dopamine addicts whose neurological decay has breeched into sociopathic behavior to continue their chemical dependency. it has nothing to do with art.
everyone is raving about puss and boots.i ll have to check it out.even drinker s chat is recommending it to him like crazy
i can t imagine being an animator on this show. what kind of person draws this stuff and who writes about a 15-year old kid having a tiny peen it s projection.
evil cannot create. it can only corrupt and destroy.
more hate fiction. the opposite of fan fiction. you see a lot of that  in this contemporary dystopia. i miss that time where such a dystopia was a mere futuristic nightmare. exotic science fiction  for your entertainment. it is not so entertaining when they actually do it!
sorry that its off topic but what is that song in your outro  sounds good! xd
hey do you remember santa inc   lmao that s velma in a year.
puss in boots was pretty badass.  animation kinda like what they did with hotel transylvania the fourth one.  the only thing i didn t like
they did the same thing with the archie s tv show cartoon
your service is appealing.
what s next  speed racer
may i ask wtf a  ship  is
weren t they always the stereotype of the worst kind of wasp  white-yuppy
it s a  fan fiction  written by people who aren t fans  who actually hate the source material.
mindy would ve gotten away with it  too! if it weren t for you meddling youtubers!
feels like this is a cheep way to try and top helluva boss or hazbin hotel
cute cat at beginning of video!
not just to hbo max  but an abomination to animation as a whole!
are these studios ever going to learn
everything mindy kaling has doe since the office has been damn awful. this is the worst  and that s saying something. i had a thing for her  so i gave her too many chances. that will not be a problem from now on.
i only seen the teaser like everyone else a month ago.but if you are saying you don t like she hulk what did you not like about it that was the first year i don t judge angell there is more but kast year i watched the first one and i liked it like the song i kissed a girl and i liked it but i said to myself that the she hulk was not that great looking but that is fine it s like a video game they don t do all the kick ass stuff to it unwell they now it s going to do good.
it is so good!
zoinks  mindy. you look and act just like velma!
i have lots of videos on she hulk if you re genuinely curious about my opinions
@meloniemacgoboom  sure are they on the same site.
in the grimdark of the far future  there s only w...woke!
vemla got season 2 as well
luv  it s okay to eat food. i m worried.
i am so done with all that shit all together.you have done it wokenes  you have done it  i am going to go to the gym!
i m starting to think south park and family guy were a mistake. because everyone and their dog is trying to be the successor.
mindy whatever her name is one of many who need to be banned from ever working on an existing ip ever again. ffs
they can do all what they want with that show  heck make velma sleep with scooby for all i care. i was not planning to watch it to begin with.
i didn t even watch this show
just put this on and the ad that youtube has on it is for vegan bacon... wow.
i wouldn t be caught dead watching either of those shows i prefer watching so if i can actually remember cough cough robotech cough cough remake of macgyver cough cough ncis new orleans cough cough there s no way in hell i m going to watch velma
self inserted characters have to be creative to fit the story and avoid the op self importanti plot
this one lady in this gym here in this void that doesn t even exist is all like yes here we worked out together... but guess whos in that 24 hour gas station buying big ass fountain drinks  not across the street where they have those  1.25 pizza slices  there s no crosswalk!
too many people want to be youtube critics  post a video about how bad velma is and rake in the views  enough of them that now velma has a season 2 and symbionic titan never finished its first season  what a world.
i know hate is a strong word  but i am starting to really hate this modern audience support. it seems like hollywood really wants to file for chapter 11  and i as an audience member celebrate their destruction!
sadly i watch it and i know who they are targeting audience is it s the same audience from she hulk. like in this weird show they are trying to tell kids gay people can have kids but never fully explained how just a side backstory. and also killing any straight men tha5s what this is about. like poor fred the things they did to him and one of the person who actually did the crime scene the legs are dark brown. also they do have straight people in it but gets destroyed when the guy likes the girl but for some reason every girl likes another girl.
scooby-done.
also the last of us was badass
its just so odd that the girl who plays velma is a black east indian woman vs scoobi a black woman who was a dog on the previous interactions of the tv series.
canceled the hbo sub years ago. this sure isn t going to bring me back.
they are 15  !  oh boy !!! the booze gag feel more out of place.
please don t poison your mind with this   thing
hbo max  velmaamazon  rings of powerdisney   she-hulk   willownetflix  resident evilwhat else is coming  the worst tv shows of all time have been released all within a short period of each other.
0 08 got a little glimpse of
is this the first case of a species swap  jfc
velma is so bad even melonie s cat quietly slinks away at the mere mention.
this is crazy
i hate this place but i love life. crazy.
tumblr fanfic again
it s basically porn.
this is just a scooby-doo fan-fic
it they would have called this story any other name  i might have gave it a chance.  to name it velma  though  and use the mystery gang........a gang we all know and love...  it just makes me sick.
ayo melonie!let me chop down some wood for you!
friendly hydration check.
the last time i saw the left and right unite in america before velma  was 9 11
it should be called mindy.
tell me again how they aren t groomers
dante aligheri wrote a better self-insert crack fic  and that was back in the 14th century.
1 22 you would get the sick people saying it s just a cartoon it s not real kids
this show is velma as mindy kaling
wtf is that  why can t they just make a new show
wokeness got to a point like it s woke to the wokes  it s like cancer
she s a mary scoo
no even the she hulk series is an abomination as this velma series its woke insanity!
i watched maybe about 10-15 min of the first episode and that was it  loli said .. nope i m not watching this  lol
did she saw the chapters o she is hating from what she saw in twitter
hate-baiting  the series
they re minors  well darn there goes my evening alone...
in a world where shitty fanfic gets greenlit... velma.
jinkies  melonie!
i m straight  white and a man and proud to be the wokes big bad!
you have a meower
how was this show even allowed to make air
the show is made for gay adult children with adhd  bless their heart.
this is the new programming.
but these same people rag on fans of  dead or alive  games
they turned shaggy in a fa-----y lmao
i watched 2 15 and almost cancelled my hbo max. literally the only thing that stopped me is the godzilla movies.
i think the black girl scooby was false  i m not sure
making mountains out of mole hills
this is not scooby-doo. it is a different show that uses scooby-doo names to gain attention.
the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil  is for good men to do nothing.
i hate all these videos about it  but i can t watching these videos lol every new video by someone always exposes something new and terrible about the show
so shaggy is a zoophile now
commenting to feed the algorithm
what i want to know is  what is going through these companies heads when they release this trash. is reality really so far gone that we have to put up with cartoons like this.
i could not agree more!  what a woke disaster!
it s called grooming. a spade is a spade.
if it ain t broke don t fix it
i don t think i ve seen anything so blatantly racist. and it s allowed to be shown.
.... two episodes and they beat you ove the head with the lesbian stick.
unrelated to the video but. but damn do all youtubers are cat lovers    saw one in the background walking by in this video .
this is what happens when you let a no talent hack  who has never worked a day in her life  do whatever she wants.
desecration was the point.
scooby doo  where are you
i m not going to lie i would take four seasons of she-hulk and 10 seasons of rings of power over any more of this velma show it is taking something that is near and dear to my heart and made a disgusting vulgar unnecessarily violent hateful gross and all-around unpleasant mockery of a thing i love and something i know has brought joy to countless hellions the show is not as insulting too human intelligence as something like mortal kombat 2021 the worst movie ever created objectively but it is damn close and it s definitely trying hard to be as insulting to longtime fans and fans of the characters
awww kitty walked by..
hey good morning melonie. i just want to tell you that sorry for this comment from your video from yesterday being late but i just wanted to tell you that i didn t like this new show series on hbo max and i think that they just destroy velma character on the new show and i really like the old classic cartoon show of scooby doo bc he eats scooby snacks and helps solving clues and catch the robbers who dressed up in monster outfits. anyway i just wanted to tell you that i don t like this new hbo max television show series and i didn t like how they destroyed velma s character on the show. anyway i just wanted to make a comment about that and i just wanted to tell you that i am so sorry for this being late from yesterday  ok melonie. anyway keep it up and keep doing a great job with making videos like this every day. anyway have a great day melonie.
weird and gross crowd indeed. that s just putting it mildly. you would think with all the backlash with this show hbomax would get a clue and remove this sorry excuse for a show.
this is utterly disgusting how they made the velma series wrong and deranged basically this show is giving us the middle finger.i m going to avoid the show this velma series messed up the scooby doo franchise and ruined our childhoods.
of course your on twitter
they made scooby into a girl  wtf
ngl i really like the show. i don t see it as a spin off of scooby doo. it s it own show and i quite enjoy it also it s funny . it s supposed to be adult comedy and ofc it s not kid friendly by any means! but it also actually shows how today is at some schools and some of there experiences with sexuality. it wasn t okay bacc then but now kids a saying there gay or bi at like 11 lol so it s showing us that s how today is. ik most of u don t keep in touch with school and friends bc you re probably out of it . now go ask anyone that s 15 lol. they ll tell u the same thing. this show is not for kids and have inappropriate scenes and highly allergic comedy for adults  i can t get enough lmao!!
abomination is exactly the word for velma!
soon there will be nothing left
this is a fan canon show. it s made for fans who wanted to see an lgbtq velma. the scooby reference was just rumor but they don t even have him in the show. i m going to watch it but that s just to see how far off it is.
wtf ! really ! the dog  did they really change the dog  is she really supposed to be scooby  like she has his role in the series  wtf ! how ! that s not just bad and far more boring  it s ridiculous and pathetic. so she is a dog... ok. the worst is  probably there is a reason why she has to be human. what s a thing they love to include in their shows  but what humans usually do with other humans
great video beautiful melonie!!! velma is the worst scooby-doo show of all time. i don t want to watch the show because i don t like self torture.
better then rick and morty
this is made for kiddo lover and rainbow mafia
tbh  i don t mind watching a little bit of girl girl action but not these two  lol
i love your hair!
hbo max on his dark materials just had to male angels from heaven kiss  i m done with that show.
doesn t look like i m missing anything... lol... so gross
if you tell a fuxked up joke but it s not funny... then all you ve done is said something fuxked up..
if they bring scooby into this terrible show then it s gonna be a gender neutral dog that identifies as a cat
they ruined scooby doo for us... i m so done with the wokies...
child porn hbo is trying to get out start with cartoons then to real life.
its  a cartoon- stop taking it seriously  meanwhile  everything is sexist racist and you have to point it all out  didn t they read the memo
dude they had literal 11 year olds getting freaky on camera in real life in that movie  cuties  . and the entertainment industry didn t see a problem  no one will bat an eye at 15 year old cartoons. well no one but level headed average americans
i saw a few minutes of this and wasn t very happy about this
i love shows like these and i honestly with there were more!! vox machina also coming out with a new season on january 20th!! go check it out lmao its a must!!
so uh  turns out that girl isn t called scoobi with an i  she has a different name.not trying to defend the show or anything  i ain t gonna touch it with a 40 foot pole.just wanted to let you know that was debunked.
diarrhea for the soul
poor fred. mindy kaling needs to just stop.
whenever a new popular anime comes out that has a pantie shot or a kid in a maybe suggestive pose the word  loli  gets trending on twitter do to the sheer about of bitching happening. where is the bitching from those same people  why isn t velma trending from those people bitching
0 40  update for a modern california
velma is worse than santa inc
i try to find good aspects in things most people consider terrible or bad  but my god  velma is absolute dogshit and irredeemable  they butchered velma and made her really dislikeable  i hate everything about her  i really hope some higher up at hbo realizes the mistake they made with this show and put it out of its misery  its a disgrace to scooby doo and i really feel bad for fans that love the franchise to death because they dont deserve what velma did to it.
btw i took my other comment down after you brought to my attention it was incorrect.  apologies and i already gave you a thumbs up like i do your other vids. keep up the good work. love your vids.
at least they didn t put scrappy in it.
and now scooby has been replace with a african american woman named scoobi.  lol omg lol
you left out santa inc.
that scooby is a woman now  is just a theory so far....
and velma as dethroned dragon ball evolution as the worst thing ever
chonky kitty!
my mom grew up with the original and she watch anything with this ip good or bad.  and she could stand to watch this garbage in it opening minutes. to me the only thing that wad good for scooby-doo for adults was the supernatural cross over episode.
they didn t race swap velma. they  black faced her!!
i thought glenn howerton was better than this. he s so damn funny on it s always sunny in philadelphia and a.p. bio. i guess in hollywood a check is a check.
scooby doo where are you  seriously where are you   lol
way to take something beloved since 1969 and destroy it in 20 minutes!!
what do you think of elden ring
and my boycott of hollywood shall continue.
rofl true
they made her south asian!
they should ve had velma and shaggy hook up  fred always wanted to bang daphne  and i think shaggy might have a thing for velma s glassesscooby-doo does not need alternate story arcs like it s a comic book...clearly another example of some woke idiot probably subconsciously pushing the woke example and trying to memory-hole good shows and movies like a forced mandela effectand now i m furious that they turned scooby from a dog to a black girl
i am asking where is the scooby-doo  were is the dog  omg.
i loved pinocchio the las netlflix movie. and i am 39
is this also for kids
another thing  daphne s lesbian parents are doing what one would call police brutality.lesbians doing police brutality on a white guy... as subtle as hammer strike.
the bid to add another  p  to the lgbt acronym is fighting hard.
people complaining because woke people get offended so easily and in the other hand you have this  11 41
i dont hate watch untill at least a month after the last episodes airs.but i m not even gonna do that to velma it s a waste of my time.i will see what they destroyed in the last of us show after the last episode airs to see what woke crap they did to make the adaptation for part 2 ready. they didnt want nobody involved to even play the first game which is the sorce material it s made from. and is the only really beloved game from the 2 of them. they dont want fans to really enjoy it. they want the normie population that has never even heard of the games to watch it and for the woke. that s thier target audience.
a female dog is known as a what
where can i get silicone castings of this young ladies feetasking for a friend
yeah this is the worst reboot to ever exist  oh my goodness is it horrible.  just when i think they can t do any worse than they ve already done they somehow find a way!!!
also theists when they see golden compass or literallyanythingthat doesn t adhere to their beliefs
0 08 -
wooooow you are absolutely gorgeous  subscribed!
shits just going too far now
who are these modern audiences  no one is watching these shows  they are literally making shows for no one! i don t get it.
i canceled our hbo max account.  i suggest everyone do the same.  vote with your wallet people.
thanks for the shout out to puss and boots.  i thought it was really really good  and compared to all this garbage  it was the godfather.
an insult to big mouth to compare this to big mouth
at 10seconds in  seen the kitty... the kitty s name is
what is golden compass
guys please stop saying mean things about velmai can t stop liking them fast enough.
this show was pathetic  cant believe they did them like that
and i thought she - hulk was bad. i guess there s always a bigger fish. at least most people actually don t like this show.
watch the left defend it like they have been with cuties...
the very first minute of this show is highly questionable..
thanks!
looks like the whole scoobi things is all made up. also  maybe it is intentional  but  you can t hear the video clips. the volume is way too low.
@melonie mac go boom 0 5-0 10 ooetetetetete beeby beeby yeseeiyuz! yeeyus!
we all used to laugh at how bad the trailer looked. well no one s laughing now
its a shame and disgrace its not for kids whoever made this should be ashamed of themselves wtf!
i cancelled hbo max. a nasty company that doesn t deserve anyone s money.
um...hollywood needs to be purified with fire.
if you ignore it  it will go away. there s probably more minutes spent of youtubers moaning about it than there are minutes of the actual show. just don t watch it. simple.
i m watching mike tyson mysteries. it s cooler.
i shortly saw something about this show. i saw that velma is black indian  i don t know- let s see.  it would be so hiralously weird but i never cared for scoobyy doo really  so
i think the solution is to cancel hbo max
creator comes up with bad original concept. streaming service says no.creator uses same bad concept but uses well-known ip. changing everything about ip except names.streaming service says ok. fans of ip cry for its destruction.
felony mac
abomination! hbo max! cancelled
sister.. this is like a bad fanfiction!! if you want to see what good people can do with this franchise and its characters.. like look this up on youtube..  matthew lillard does the shaggy voice for sarah
thank you so much!!!
i can hear them when i watch it  just very quiet lol. i have to be careful because they did a copyright claim last time i showed just a tiny snippet of the trailer   let alone the show itself
@meloniemacgoboom  that makes sense. i definitely wouldn t want your video to come down.
not my velma.
price increase   velma   cancelled hbo. join me! they made fun of a special needs kid. not cool
hebrew box office
shaggy is black on this show   oo
i m pretty sure the show is terrible  but i also think that melonie didn t bother to watch even one episode of it before making this video.  she is reviewing other people s tweets about the episode with zero unique insight.
oooo kitty  cat 0 29
thought the first 2 episodes where good tbh . look at it as a tv-ma spinoff
shaggy and velma are white. that is all.
well...better than big mouth at least.
ruh roh raggy
such a disappointment that they wasted time and money on this.
the fact hbo max approved to air this is just disgusting.... everything mindy does is insuferable... the only role she plays is her. its a joke.
1st red flag is race swapping cartoon characters lol.
i realized velma is litterally show about woke ideas that have nothing todo with actuall good ideas velma could been really awsome show about  velma  how she made and created scooby doo gang instead we got this.........why
if anyone wants to hate watch this remember to get out your peg leg and eye patch and pirate it.
i am so sick of this
velma   mindy kaling s wet dream fan fic where she is velma
i m so glad that the goal of everyone is to ruin shows i liked as a kid you could have wrote your own garbage ass show that doesn t use characters we used to like
i have to like watch 6 scooby doo movies to even get this trash out my head
why is velma orange
they made her have a south asian background in this series.
why people are so complaining  wednesday is not loyal either  also this is not a kids show  this is basically what people write on fanfics lol they always turn people into gay don t fool me you would do the same if you had the chance lolololololololol
this only says more about what a garbage human being mindy  kaling is   has nothing to do with scooby doo or velma.
don t watch this show  melonie.  you have better things to do with your life.
she-hulk rings of power witcher blood origin cuties resident evil and velma all of these shows are nothing but woke abominations
ain t no why that girl name scooby with an i that s so disturbing. pretty much saying he would f the dog. who is this show for!!!!
aside from the poor writing of the show  i absolutely abhor the blackwashing brownwashing yellowwashing of the characters except for fred. they really do hate the og designs.
this show has many issues  but by far  the biggest issue is the hypersexualization of teenagers. it s disgusting.
you think this is bad  watch bigmouth
shocking enough woke people are hating the show
this show is getting better is bout time they were work if all things homicide guess got family guy ep 2 too thank for r this n though they first time they parody was that viewers mail spoof of the little rascals back in  02 but i was wrong still nudity n not all wit dotted eyes side s i m learning if the the crime is based on murder the target screams big more for ted bundy then jeffrey dahmer get it this is ted         this is jeff         uh example women he well wasn t known dahmer had chick victims still this all bout the femicide it s up too the hot girls trio this show do not stink
this is disgusting show  they crapping on my childhood
the n w show is a pathetic display of narcissism and spite. it ll never ever replace the original scooby doo.
it is so bad  reviewers are gonna pirate because its not worth their money
i saw a chunky kitty
yeah ..i won t even watch out of curiosity.every view they get only helps them to continue this bs
in my opinion  tim roth played a decent abomination.    r.g.
that woke wave continues trying to swallow up children everywhere. i got my kids into scooby doo  because i loved it as a kid. they won t be watching this rubbish!

rule 43  fan  fiction writers have invaded the fandoms
it just makes no sense to me. how on earth does a guy who got rid of completed stuff that at least would have made a little bit including a couple scooby-doo content that would have at least felt like scooby-doo but then not only say this is fine but pick this over content that is actually like the ip. a pos work that is completely brand damaging level bad. like i literally don t understand. there must be some sort of beef someone has on zazlav or something. it s the only thing that makes sense. like  how crazy and stupid is it that the only thing that makes sense is that he was blackmailed to leave things be.  cause there is literally no logic behind it.
this is a deplorable show truly. makes she hulk look average
go woke go broke
had to pause at the scoobi part. they made him into a black girl. theyre setting the bar high for crap early in 2023
chunky cat
so mindy made the show to explicitly crap on everything and make scooby a black female furry
velma is absolutely a horrible show they make the characters unlikable even the 13 ghosts of scooby-doo and scooby-doo on zombie island original version were way better than this monstrosity and insanity. if they wanted to take scooby-doo in a new direction instead of people in costumes why not make them real monsters and add real paranormal activity like the 13 ghosts of scooby-doo for an older audience or if they wanted an adult version have it like futurerama or family guy along those lines.
yeah  i heard they were getting a second season     yippie i can t wait. i am not supporting trash or garbage sorry.
kitty!
algorithm
nice ink
they did something similar to thunder cats . they call it thunder cats roar it is so bad none of the characters look even close to the original . i mean the teen titans adaptation is a lot better . at least with teen titans go you can tell who the characters are .
wait.....velma is black now
holy crap stop shouting into the microphone.  i wanted to watch this  but my volume doesn t go low enough.
leave our childhoods alone. it s just the fact that they have no talent to make anything new. all movies are remakes all shows are remakes. they just destroyed everything with their no talent ways. this has been going on for waaay too long.  they just have to stop stealing old shows and movies. next they ll be making a new gumby on cartoon network lol.
i ll stick to the original cartoons
hollywood is sick
the same people who support this are the same people who lose their shit over chris pratt voicing mario.
all bad things are three
i will never never ever ever watch this abomination of a show. if mindy khaling wanted to do a self-insert  adult animated series where she solved crimes  i gladly would have watched that show as i think she is usually pretty funny. but this is absolute trash. the writers didn t have enough faith in the material so they needed established characters.  charlies angels  cough  cough
tax right off.
wait...what...scooby is black !
scooby is a wooman
it s glen howerton acting as dennis voicing fred.....it s lame.
lol
beta simp
dont forget the bios they did.fred was saposed be 16 and had not his puberty yet wtf
snake eating it s own tail. the show is so inclusive it wraps right back around to being racist. hbo got some very sus people working there
abomination nation on that channel
it might be the lighting  but your lips look chapped  try carmex!
wow! after watching this i had no idea straight white males had it so rough
this has to be deliberate.  mindy kaling cannot possibly be so clueless as to really believe this would be well received by virtually anyone.  is this just a less nuanced example of crapping on a popular ip
hate hate hate velma
just another franchise used as a  woke  platform. all because any new platform would get ignored  as it should.
on no. two teens kissed. that would never happen in real life  cuz it s not like teens fall in love with eachothers in school or go through puberty or have girlfriends or boyfriends. give me a break. this is virtue signaling for the sake of virtue signaling.
just don t watch it.. then they won t keep making garbage like this. it s soo simple.
shipping  has to be the cringiest gen z saying. i don t mind yeet and cap but jesus please kill shipping
i hate that glenn howerton  dennis reynolds  is involved with this dumpster fire.but then again kaling was on the two least funny episodes of always sunny.
men are getting pretty tired of this crap
imagine bastardizing a whole ip and trying to be  progressive  about it. jesus christ am i convinced this is absolutely the worst timeline lol
this is a prime example of trash show . the most sad thing is they try to make jokes
this just show s how sad they are  they are ripping off scooby doo  a show that has not been relevant for over a decade  they are clearly out of relevant and popular ip s. now they are attacking thing s no one cares about anymore. it just reeks desperation on their part  what s next  miami vice  god i hope so  the acting  music and cinematography where epic. good luck getting even one of those right  who am i trying to kid  it will be fubar all the way.
hey it melonie i remember u from like 10 years ago
they re doing what!!!!    scooby  or scoobi   into a black female character.  transforming scooby into any ethnic person is just  weird.  and why
the puss in boots looked cool. hbo will probably try to make hitler look cool next. nice channel.
what s the point of these asinine versions of shows from our childhood  they are so devoid of an original thought they ll do everything they can to tear down. no original thought and no ability to actually write something. pathetic.
not even  woke culture  is this bad. as someone who is more left leaning politically  this show is absolutely atrocious. it s meant to piss all of us off lmfao
literally nobody asked for this  it s all extremely forced. this will do even more damage to the kids of this generation who watch these new  modern  takes on entertainment.
its a cartoon. if u dont like it don t watch it. that will speak volumes.
i love how they cry racism and make the asian woman yellow
kitty.
the show isn t even woke.  it can t even get that right.  everything is treated as a joke  even the things that should be serious.  the only thing the show has going for it is a few interesting visuals.
velma thunberg
they could ve made shaggy and velma couple and it wouldn t be a problem but noooooooooooooooo. instead they made daphne  and velma a gay couple  do you really want to brainwash kids like that  okay byebye.
.
this is just a badly written  self insert fanction
shows based on a huge inferiority complex have to be good right
2 2 5
i seriously hope the planet killing asteroid hits soon..........................
never been a fan of blackface
all this show is  is just gotham high  and i m not starfire  all over again. it has all the same checkboxes  they re all about some rebellious outcast high school girl  who is the best one there  surrounded by horrific versions of existing characters.hollywood  we get it  you had a horrible time in high school! but  you re in your 40 s  get over it already!
this is scooby doo in an alternate universe. i refuse it is within our world and lifetime. this piece garbage needs to get wiped out from existence.
race swopping in a live action because you have a better actor for the roll is one thing. race swopping in a cartoon is just dumb. if this is  woke culture  i have questions. the first one is does it require that the writers be asleep when making the so called  woke  show. this show sounds like it was made by a.i that was feed 90 s sitcoms by accountants as it base information. really hope that every one involved in this horror of a show loses their shirt. not my scooby!
well you don t know how bad a show is unless you watch it yourself or check out some good reviews it helps anyway
i think this really poor excuse topic on show. will agreed show is bad but low excuse argument.show is bad but low excuse
meep
you ever hear about big mouth  where s the outcry  relax this is a bad show  there s plenty of them.
it is a trash show. but when the writers and producers are low-end  did we expect better
its sad to see the show suck so much but the woke stuff has to ruin everything we like i guess.
i watched it for a few min and i just turned it off
i still think big mouth is worse. don t get me wrong i am vehemently disgusted with velma.
my question is what was the point of making this show  no one asked for this. no one care about this character. tell me are they going to make a show for each of the mystery gang members  yeah i didn t think so. i d rather watch a shaggy show than this
2023 has a good start  ! another horrible series...this is just written out of spite and pure hate.
they re just cheap caricatures
this show is one of those horrible reboots where it ruins the original   this is so far off the mark it actually makes me feel embarrassed to have even liked it to begin with! my advice   avoid!.. avoid at all cost   just brain rotting trash    sorry mindy   hard miss here.
if i had an hbo max subscription  i would cancel it due to the blatant racism this show.
it is a cartoon. people  grow up.
then stop watching all the terrible show
i ve never watched this show  and from what little you showed us i never intend to watch this show. velma looks terrible and certainly doesn t make me want to pay for a hbo max subscription. try again  warner discovery.
remember its not racist if your harassing a white guy
even dragon ball evolution did better. that s how bad it is
proverbs not pronouns!!!
excuse me while i go watch 2002 scooby-doo instead of this trash.
i wont see the  show
i hate watched it for you.  it s not worth it at all
just when you think hollywood couldn t get any worse they surprise you. this is just more woke propaganda.
cultural appropriation 101
comment for you hun.....
scooby is a black woman  stop stealing netflix s moves!
how are are you doing cutie
another show placing  woke  virtue signaling over quality character development and stories.
it s just a trash show  hardly anyone likes it including the audience it s seemingly made for  the minors thing is the least of its issues. super common in teen dramas and anime and animation  since pretty much ever.
this show is problematic. i ve seen many adult swim shows that are nuts but this one is just something else.
horrible people made a horrible show and will soon blame us because we are horrible people for not supporting this garbage...... yep  that checks out
xd im glad its hated....ooooh im sooo gladvelma is one of my favorite characters ever im so glad no one likes this fanfic trashcan dumpster fire of a show.
first of all who cares if there minor s there cartoon characters and you didn t seem to have an issue with this lesbian overtones when it was in steven universe
seems that it s soft core fan fiction.
your not woke  you sure have adopted the look.
u rock but that velma crap needs to be flushed. do they own the scooby franchise now
mindy was the worst character on the office. she has always been insufferable.
when you think it couldn t get any lower.  it does.  total crap
this show deserves to burn don t get me wrong but honestly the sexualization of cartoon students is where you lose me considering family guy did this all the time with stewie  chris and meg yet nobody ever complained. it s the same argument sjws make on twitter when it comes to anime students. they re pixels on a screen voiced by grown sad and lonely adults that nobody should ever take seriously.
this show is so horrible
the show sucks they need to can it
some people might find it weird but i do know stuff like that isn t new i know south park has done worse but i get why people don t like it in the velma show.also when did she talk about steven universe is that an old video
@yulee3266  she didn t i speaking from the perspective of you as in of you people
@theclipman9283  alright then i definitely didn t pick up on that
@yulee3266  it s okay
my look is from 2003  not woke
you re  and what defines the woke look
what makes you say there voice actors are lonely sad adults
mindy kaling is transphobic!  she must be a conservative!everyone right of marx    no.
woke cartoons....fml
is your cat pregnant  that s all i care about.
is anyone also going to point out that beside ripping off scooby doo to make something that is no longer from the scooby doo universe... they lazy character illustrators designers ripped off harley quinn the animated show....  daphne is 100  a rip off poison ivy... same hair doo  green ish  skin  same facial features.  total lack of talent... i hope the harley quinn show folks go after them for plagiarism.
wtf      the dog is a black women
hey so pretty melonie first did i see a fat cat over there  second velma is the worst tv show for children for sure  velma should be cancelled once and for all.
ive never seen a show with such horrible writing.
who asked for this
cringe. this falls right in there with big mouth cartoon series. ick
this show is rasis
just terrible now you gotta watch what your kids watch they cant even watch scooby doo what the heck is wrong with this world
don t support this.
it s just a drawing bro by the definition it has no actual age. boy if you hate this subpar xual scenes then you must hate anime and manga because of the fan service
show seems full of anti-white misandry  and but also generally just mean-spirited
i don t think he is
@meloniemacgoboom  oh  you got a chonky boy.
toss them in the woodchipper and be done with it.
when this made the absolute garbage live action movies look good  there is no way i will would waste my time watching this. also calarts style animation is ugly
cartoon characters arent real.....so they arent minors. stop giving pixels real world rights. theres real kids out there being exploited and you complain about cartoons
the last of us show is way more better than this crap
for crying out loud. the old scooby do  and the a-pup named scooby do were so much better than this leftist crap.
make something better
you really upset about a cartoon get a life
