      <span>The purpose of this is not to influence Melonie Mac to make any different content than what she wants, or for myself to get any recognition or favors or brownie points from this. It is to preserve history through the comments written by real humans that a person Melonie Mac made some videos once and those videos influenced other people in a positive way and brought praise to Jesus. Watching this screensaver is simple way to be encouraged in your own life. I just want to make it easy for people to get into videos and be encouraged from them, so I conceived of and made this by myself. Click on a quote to go to that video it is pulled from. Thank you for watching and have a wonderful rest of your day :)</span>

I think their message is basically neo-mccarthyism with an even more dangerous reach. I put them in the same sad camp as scientologists and they attack their perceived enemies exactly the same way.     I was security at a bar and a bartender for a total of more than fifteen years. one of my major responsibilities was keeping an eye out for predatory males in both roles.  I laugh every time you talk about feeling safer around  toxic  masculinity than woke male feminists because you could not be more correct. I learned quickly who the real male predators were.  I even like your discussion of Bible passages. I find it more a genuine act of your belief system than an attack on mine.  please keep doing what you do in this channel cause it is so important and know that you have friends and allies in areas you might not think you do.   thanks for the videos"

Ive had to own up to my failings and face my  demons  on a deep personal level and honestly felt that I wasn t really worthy of the title of Christian. recently a very close friend started asking me at the end of each week to come to church with him and I finally ran out of excuses  between he and his wife s gentle insistence and seeing more of the commentators I watch or listen to  like your channel and a few others  find or profess their faith openly I was finally motivated to take him up on the offer. I still feel a bit out of place to a degree  like a stray dog that just happened to wander in  but reconnecting with my faith has brought me a level of peace and calm that I haven t felt in many years. sorry for being long winded  I just wanted to thank you for being one of the positive influences in this space."
