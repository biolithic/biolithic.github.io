we just saw that ai can fix lara croft in seconds what developers can t do in years.
we would all be lucky to find someone who looks at us like melonie looks at lara.
amazing how ai made lara more athletic  less generic  and unique. all the the while she remains feminine and capable  something developers can t do anymore.
ironic that a.i. is more based than the game company developers when it comes to badass female designs.
far superior and more real then the trash devs came out with. she actually has muscle something the morons always forget.
the last image of lara croft was drop dead gorgeous and if something close to that was ever used in official marketing then she would definitely be in the public s eye just based on how beautiful she is if we got something resembling that version. i also don t know why they are persistent on continuing the story of survivor lara cuz almost everyone is essentially tired of her at this point and just want classic or even legend lara back.
ugly hates beauty  jordan peterson.
so ai can have it s uses! i m glad beloved characters can be redeemed. great video melonie! you look great today!
how hard is for people to understand that lara needs to be ultra hot  like so hot that she is intimidating af. and she as a character has to believe that she is the hottest woman in the world
considering how fans managed to represent lara so much better  at this point i have higher hopes for a indie studio to make a real tomb raider game and name it  crypt thief  for legal reasons.
as a former huge fan of tomb raider  i love that boom boom mac still carries the flame for lara croft.
lara is supposed to look incredible. the people offended by her appearance and need it changed so it appeals to them have no right to call themselves fans of the character seeing as they can t accept her the way she is.
ai has definitely come a long way.  her father was an archeologist  right   they ve done different things with her mom s origin  but she was raised by her father so she takes after him and that s why she likes exploring and don t take  stuff from men cause she can defend herself even against strong guys
rough work day  thanks for cheering me up with some of your smiles and some lara croft stuff.
okay  first of all i love the ai design that laura has been given.second of all  what program did that  and how much does it cost third of all  thank you for another wonderful video melanie  and god bless everyone
we had artists doing this. glad to see even al recognizing who lara really is.
hopefully the people making the next game  hear you and we get your ideal lara croft.
even the robots know what lara croft is supposed to look like. haha
i own all of the strategy guides for every tomb raider game and there is some great artwork drawings of lara in those early books.... more of that please!
i think the world is ready for a 3 legged lara croft.
there s a difference between  can t  and  refuse .
can t or wont
so sad but so true
can and probably would. senior devs are like mercenaries  they ll do exactly what the people with money ask them to
ditto for april o neil. ai art was much better than humans at this. ai is not woke it seems.
ai is trianed on humans this didn t come out of thin air there are still good concept artist i agree with it being a shit design thought
longer. near 2 decades.
seriously  lara croft is basically a female james bond in terms of personality  spouts off one-liners while shooting you in the face.

based
she may be hotter for lara than i will ever be. i need to do better
without knowing how someone used ai to create these  i don t think it s fair to call these results amazing.  correct me if i m wrong. maybe the article explains it
@flaminghead1va  the amazing part is not the  art  itself. it s getting the  look  for laura down  as opposed to the devs who are actively avoiding it to be more pc sjw woke whatever tf
they weren t trying to  fix  her in that sense to begin with. what they did to her was what they considered to be a fix. lmfao
i feel like at a minimum ai is going to revolutionize concept art in general.
means it s on purpose.also design by committee never works especially when it s filled with wokies
@shine boi keke yep  and it s definitely  refuse  in this case. out of so many alternate costumes  none of them has the iconic shorts outside of the low-res models. they could ve scalped us for so much moolah by selling the classic short-shorts as dlc but they apparently hate money.
so making her unrealistic is fixing
@kuggacourage gx  what do you mean by  unrealistic
devs don t want her to look like classic lara.
@kuggacourage gx  mate casually calling actual living and breathing women with the same body type  unrealistic   isn t that some kind of body shaming by proxy  sexy physically attractive women exist  despite some people s efforts to bury their heads in the sand while screaming about unrealistic beauty standards
@solomani not because the ai is much better but because the human directors were so woke that they lose track of their own identity.
@zhengyingli  does melonie look like that  i am sub to her and like her but she needs to cut this dishonest act. go back to being genuine
@kuggacourage gx  ever watched the olympics
@zhengyingli  u do know alot of ppl don t watch it right    also why does it matter or have to do with this
@kuggacourage gx  don t move the goalpost.
@redwoodtheelf  exactly
@red hakiim  how are they being woke
@zhengyingli  i am not moving at all nor the goal post. i asked u a simple question that u chose to ignore cause it will debunk your bs.then u asked me a very dumb question  that had nothing to do with what we are talking about at all  which would also backfire on u .  so answer the question
@kuggacourage gx  it has everything to do with this topic. the olympics show that classic lara s body s not at all unrealistic.
@kuggacourage gx  it may not be majority but they exist  which  ipso facto  makes you a body shamer for calling it unrealistic. is it unrealistic that an attractive sexy  woman who is physically active would be fit   sure. in the real world women manage to match the standard soooo   don t confuse unrealistic with hard. athletes are athletes and models are models for a reason. they bust their butts to achieve that  this is reality.uncommon maybe . but i can t decide whether the irony in you calling it unrealistic while not realizing the implications is funny or depressing.
@red hakiim  wdym   woke is their identity
@kuggacourage gx  no making her from the original source inaccurate is fixing
@symbiote x  what
@redwoodtheelf spouting off one liners while killing you is literally the description of many many characters from ash williams to duke nukem.not a narrow enough to fit her with just bond.
developers are the one who made the al
correction  won t do.
...what developers  won t do aren t creatively allowed to dothey re perfectly capable of fixing it  they have the means. yes  of course most of this is intentional by someone higher up  but every single little graphics designer  e.t.c. shouldn t necessarily suffer for that.
@yet anotherspuart  how the f is she a blob  the woman is fit af for the game she is in. also what tf feminists have to do with this  also once again wtf does communism have to do with this
and the developers have a crying fit after an ai can do better
speaking as a developer  we can! and also  we want to. but you d be surprised what we have to deal with when working under a major company.. suddenly bureaucracy reigns and we have to listen to every crybaby out there. big studio s are castrated and forced to live under woke ideology. it takes just 1 person on twitter to be offended and suddenly we have to protect their interests. it s sad.. aaa game development is no longer about a group of creative people having the time of their lives. it s all about thick management layers and making sure nobody out there is offended. oh and let s not forget the funding that is received for being diverse and inclusive.
@radioactivegoose  yet yall are also being crybabies too
i don t see the issue with lara
@jeymez  based
yeah nowaday lara lroft must not look too feminine and keep a teenage body
@radioactivegoose   having the time of their lives i know game devs did enjoy their times during certain games creations but honestly some of the best games in recent years were probably the best and worst times of a devs life full of crunch and overtime.its even worse for japanese devs who are practically just waiting to die of stress.
@redwoodtheelf  not james bond but indiana jones. tomb raider was literally just an indiana jones game with a female lead.
it is not can t.. it is they do not want  because well   you know why.
to be fair this would be more on the directors. to survive as a developer in the industry one needs to develop a mercenary state of mind. you go where the money is and follow the mission statement to the letter  or get laid off
@  kyu  or go where the esg score will be boosted to get more investor money
hell  micheal bay can make a better lara croft movie than modern media
@matsu crunch   what does  esg  stand for
unfortunately devs are at best slightly middle management  like one step up from the peon workers  the suits at the top and their precious marketing department  who spend all day on social media looking for  trends   are the ones who call the shots and push crap onto the devs.honestly this is why it is better to go indie if you wanna make a game  tying yourself to corporate overlords is just asking to lose all control over your product.and if you don t like it  well you can leave but odds are they made you sign a non compete contract so you are now stuck waiting out several years to actually make anything.
@druid of scosglen  always blew my mind how the grunt workers who had their passion turned into mindless factory work by the suits with money are the ones getting the blame for stupid shit like this.i mean  it s not a secret that the people who suffer the most from the pre release grind at these huge game studios are the developers who have to follow orders or get laid off
@tyconewrc  garbage that forces a company to make stupid decisions for free gooberment money
no  it isn t.  it s based on a data pool of idealization and being unattainable  finds it marketable  and opts for that in the absence of conceited personalities or ideologies.  the fans  outcry for the past few years also contributed.  it isn t ironic that an ai drawing system can churn out a more acceptable image for lara croft--it is expected.
i for one welcome our new ai overlords.
nowdays if you think rationally you are based
they gave her some muscle in shadow but again  it was shadow
muscle created unreal expectations for rotten potatoes.
when they do give them muscles  they overdo it and build them like men.
@the lostone  exactly they make them masculine and not in a balance feminine toned way and that s the problem right there
yea  the sales should show that. pretty sure the last game was  flop
i prefer the ps2 era
@erik stevens  hell my wife loved the old games for their action but mainly the puzzle element.she tried to play the newer games  she played one and not for long before she got me to show me a scene.she was pissed that basically she had hit a point where a bs death occurs unleash you qte button mash  she went on a tirade about how the game is mostly qte s.i was both proud of her and a little scared of how pissed she was.
beauty   goodugly   evil-disney movies
idk  i don t hate it.
@chandller burse  can also happen in reality too. not 100   but you d be right more often than not.
@supreme caffeine  its called assumption based on bias.
@chandller burse  it s called led pattern recognition.
@supreme caffeine  yeah that sure helped victims of bundy and dahmer.
@supreme caffeine  the more barbified and makeup filled a woman is often she is likelier to be more entitled as far i see.
@chandller burse  i m guessing you don t understand what  not 100   means. also  there was a pattern with dahmer. what with his connections and the people he knew.but  i do like how you ve only mentioned the most famous predators. there have been tens of thousands in this country alone  but you only mentioned a few who broke the mold.
@chandller burse  so you do know what pattern recognition is. what with that good example you just gave. listen  pattern recognition exists for a reason. it s a survival mechanism ingrained in all living creatures. if we ignore it we re only hurting ourselves at best. hurt feelings aren t worth a life.
@supreme caffeine  humans really should ve never been social creatures at least to todays account i honestly believe our desire for interaction and freedom contradict each other rather than compliment we refuse kindness or to be kind but then we desire it and even demand it.we demand benefit of doubt but often refuse the courtesy to others.if we weren t social we would never have made any progress technologically or societal wise sure but perhaps maybe thats the only reason we are social to benefit ourselves and what we have rather than to actually care for sociality.or some dumb psychologist shit.
@chandller burse  the last bit of your comment is correct. seriously  that sludge just read as  humanity bad.  ironic  considering all complex  highly social creatures exhibit the same traits  but humans have the highest out-group consideration.
@supreme caffeine  i never said humans are bad but we certainly feel like we are hopeless
@supreme caffeine  also its odd you called it correct but then seem to insult it.
@chandller burse  who s this  we  you re speaking for  humanity has never had it better. rewind the clock 200 years and most people you ve ever seen or spoken to would have either died in their childhood  been in extreme poverty  or be slaves.
@chandller burse  i was more surprised that you gave a correct example of pattern recognition. your previous comment made it seem like you never heard of it.
@supreme caffeine  that doesn t matter our technological progress is nice yes but we don t seem to better ourselves we continue to go through cycles of war and racism and killing and hatred.we are consuming every resource we have here and the tech to exploit planets let alone our galaxy or solar system is not exactly within our reach since ftl travel is effectively impossible for us now.mars is a possibility but colonizing it is actually not that likely.and whether you believe it or not our world is suffering from our own effects it has to be it cannot simply just take all of our pollution and resource consumption forever.not to mention we are not only stuck in these limits due to technological limitations but also because of our own lack of willingness to adapt quicker.i don t know i use to think as a kid we were heading towards a better future but do you people really believe that still after everything that keeps happening  and i mean in terms of our future as a species  putting aside religion and godly beliefs which even i hold if our species is meant to continue much longer it cannot end well and to be fair even the bible simply predicts we are suppose to get so much worse.and the more people speak their minds and are given a voice by internet and media it seems like most of the voices are quite ignorant and selfish and are only bent on arguing and blaming rather than fixing.but this is just my take.not to mention a third world war is also a plausibility let alone a potential end for us too then.
@supreme caffeine  sickness and health have improved but thats not my point that was done with technology and lets be fair our world is so odd today there are people who don t even believe thats true they think medicine is what made us worse today not better.
@supreme caffeine  i just mean ugly and beauty both have bad sides
@supreme caffeine  hatred and war exists among animals not really their battles is small its beneficial to ecosystems even our wars are devestating.and what part of animal minds have proven to us they hate each other  they fear each other and see each other as food but hatred is too complex of an emotion for them to all have and use against their fellow creatures.and besides i ve seen diverse animals get along better than most humans on large scales.
@supreme caffeine  yes i am so totally slowing progress by pointing out that our arguing has done jackshit for our progress.and then you just argue about what i said lol.
@supreme caffeine the moral compass should ve been on a tedtalk video not lara croft i ve seen jordon p n i m sure he would have comments about lara n even if it wasn t positive constrictive facts then it still wouldn t change things he only 1 of 7 billion people who in the eye of the beholder may chooses left or right or not at all if not all effects all.
@chandller burse  d say be the change uu desire to c n maybe one day u d b able to change things on the outside if not by roads end u at least did. integrity resolve commitment to wat u desire n others will watch with eyes full of ugly or beauty regardless of wat u c.
@chandller burse  it s only true until you get movies like beauty and the beast  hunchback of notre dame  or villains that don t fit the ugly trope like maleficent.
@hideo freaking kojima  doesn t beast become a beautiful man at the end of his story
@kenetic woodstone  you can t change your physical traits without surgery really.
@kenetic woodstone  the whole idea that beauty is subjective is mostly bull. across nearly all cultures  even ones that had been isolated since the ice age  what makes a person attractive has been pretty consistent.
@chandller burse  exercise and taking care your body will effect your appearance.
@supreme caffeine  not sure about using subjective i honestly see it in a scientific spiritual perception positive negative or yang yin hot cold maybe its a preference of state of matter in dna genetics i really dunno just theory not actual real experience or experiment then theirs rarity hydrogen is abundant till gold or diamond rarity in lack of consistent material to form such gold more commonly same wit genetics darwin had some of it highlighted just not perfected.
@supreme caffeine  it doesn t change facial traits or deformities or anything else
@supreme caffeine  subjectively people think megan fox is a hot woman.subjectively i think she looks too barbified.thats what people mean when they say beauty is subjective.just because chiseled muscles and curves have always been idolized  which by the way has changed in some ways and is ironically despite your statement sort of is changing since body acceptance has become fairly extreme  not to mention how one looks and dresses has changed from men and women wearing corsets to fedoras being a masculine hat how society views what looks good and what doesn t has always changed in some form to be fair.
@supreme caffeine  i don t read tabloids and i thought much of the audience here also were fairly into the  apocalypse is coming soon a lot of people here hold the view that the current world is a sign of our end.
@supreme caffeine  no i am arguably trying to be realistic nothing guarantees our species will make it.
@kenetic woodstone  it s just biology.
@chandller burse  exercise will affect your facial traits by burning the fat stored in your body. including your face. taking care of your body also prevents deformities formed from bad health.
@chandller burse  great. good for you. doesn t disprove the fact nearly every civilization on earth would say she s attractive by their beauty standards. funny  because chiseled muscles and curves are still the most sought-after body types according to dating app data  erotica  and general media around the world. the corset is literally just a waist-slimming device and the fedora still looks good when worn with a proper suit. guess what s still regarded as attractive  slim waists and good suits.
@chandller burse  realistic  we could launch every nuke in existence at the same time and humanity would still survive.
@chandller burse  megan fox is foxy  i m sure theirs a person who ll say she ugly butt that s just as subjective as saying she s gorgeous  i dunno her personally so just appearance alone she seems to have less make up then others actress due to her rare wonder women like features almost as rare as earth itself n the biology fur planets to form let alone have life that utilize appearance as keys to mate kin.
@kenetic woodstone  she looks plastic in some movies.
@kenetic woodstone  maybe its just because i prefer freckled pale redheads and amanda seyfried looked a lot prettier than she did in jennifers body.
@kenetic woodstone  the way your comment sounds like you are trying to say megan fox is some rare goddess when as far i see there are a lot of famous celeb women who look like her.at the very least taylor swift isn t too far from her either.
@supreme caffeine  do you see anyone wearing a fucking fedora even with a suit
@supreme caffeine  i am not saying curves and muscles are not sought after but figuring since the audience here is a political right leaning type i figured you agree with the observations and studies made that the bad extremist body acceptance ideologies are likely going to change perceptions of what is beautiful.
@supreme caffeine  i don t have fat in my face people work out but their face still looks the same.hell geralt of rivia a favorite here is one ugly man in the face in the books and first game.henry cavill couldn t capture that unfortunately maybe he wanted to.i go to the gym everyday the men there aren t ugly but their face isn t anything amazing.
@supreme caffeine  so birth deformities and scars will go away all i am saying is certain traits cannot be fixed entirely.
@supreme caffeine  how would only the west collapse  the east would also be hit by nukes.
@chandller burse  yes  older men who can afford a good  tailored suit.
@chandller burse  is said it can prevent deformities caused by bad health. learn how to read. it doesn t matter in the long run. exercise and taking care of your body will help anyone.
@supreme caffeine  older men with older fashion tastes.but i rarely if ever see anyone else wearing a suit with a fedora.
@supreme caffeine  hell even trench coats and fedoras were normal at one point but if you wore one now you be a incel or neckbeard nerd.
@chandller burse  no  it s because older men tend to be the only ones who dress to pull it off.
@chandller burse  congrats you identified the reason for the modern perception of the fedora and the trench coat.
@supreme caffeine  okay and  you haven t proven any of my points wrong beyond saying that there are exceptions to the rule.
@supreme caffeine  and i said what about birth defects and scars  thats what i meant when i said deformities.
@supreme caffeine  okay then so only older men can pull it off now so times have indeed changed because back in the earlier 1900s those old men were young and they dressed that way too and their fathers as well.
@chandller burse  that s it just preference wat others prefer is fur them not me n yes if u actually did a survey i m sure plenty of other females can b on par in comparison to megan fox n taylor swift is another rare face hence look alike or stunt double megan being less or more stars than another isn t the main point since ten men can look at the same women n only 7 will desire her mate wise based on lvl of attraction polarity magnetism gravity only humans invented 1st 2nd 3rd places to muddy perception on mating n with who breed control  butt o this planet isn t one giant prison experiment.
@kenetic woodstone  not to be super rude but what is wrong with your writing is english not your first language its just its hard to read your comment.especially since it keeps going back and forth with good spelling and then not.
@chandller burse  its called slang i m american n use words universally since words r greek origin based from most sources.
@kenetic woodstone  this isn t slang.
@chandller burse  its my slang a lil bit of nostradamus n broken poetry combined with wit   no grammer to make slanguguage a preference of mine and possibly not subjective.
@supreme caffeine  but for how long  and how bad would the devastation be  how well will we recover and how will it affect us years later radiation doesn t just clear without any effects left on human bodies.
@chandller burse  i can t say i like you. not even with arthur as your profile picture. it s like you refuse to comprehend anything unless i repeat it several times. yes. young men can pull off a fedora if they re properly dressed for it.
@chandller burse  if all of civilization were to crumble tomorrow we d recover after a few centuries. no long in a relative sense. slow down our efforts to colonize space. most nuclear bombs have very short half-lives. hiroshima and nagasaki were safe in a matter of weeks.
@supreme caffeine  hiroshima and nagasaki were bombed by the first nukes the current ones are much stronger now.and its gonna be thousands of them not 2.
@supreme caffeine  pretty sure scientists argue that colonizing space isn t really that plausible terraforming planets is a concept not a fact.
@supreme caffeine  yet no one does and i feel a lot of people wouldn t want to nor like how that person looks.some could pull it off yes dude but again you re saying an exception not the rule.and when have we ever liked each other at all here why would i expect you to we ve been arguing for a week or so.
@supreme caffeine  i really do not understand why you re getting upset at me i may have been irritated here myself but lets be fair we have different views but what you keep answering me with doesn t to me prove anything.humanity is its own biggest threat and right now we have to wonder will we have a tomorrow and honestly if humanity even continues after a war we will likely keep repeating our cycles of mistakes and death.is it so bad to really look at all this and kind of be doubtful at our species abilities as a christian i am suppose to believe the world will get worse and end.humans are just struggling to make things permanently better yet no one has nor can.
@chandller burse  modern nukes have a less radioactive yield due to its more efficient design. larger explosion and less radiation.a deep basement is enough to protect you from a nuke. living in a remote  mountainous area would make you nearly immune to the blast.
@chandller burse  everyone who s worn it with proper attire can pull it off. it s not proper business wear anymore  so it s only worn for several other reasons. casual wear  period correct costumes  or by some cringe neckbeard on reddit. old people do the first one  young people do the second  and redditers do the third. all but the third pull off.good to see you re self-aware.
@supreme caffeine  its still not fashionable really
@chandller burse  still looks good with a tailored suit.
@supreme caffeine  its still not in fashion.
@chandller burse  it s one of the most popular hat styles today. about as common as the stetson and the paperboy.
@supreme caffeine  people don t wear fedoras at all unless they are literally leaning hard into the incel thing or are in a period costume as far i still see dude.
@supreme caffeine  we are throwing money at nasa and the army too and people hate that too.climate change if a real issue is apart of what i mean by we are making things worse.its really weird whether or not you believe in it do you really think our actions haven t caused damage
@supreme caffeine  we should also try to save this planet before going to ruin others too.but thats just hippie talk i guess actually giving a crap about the planet lol.this entire conversation was went nowhere its a cycle like our existence.
thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome!
she can push the bolders
you get it
she is the female indiana jones
@jk visions  and nathan drake is male lara croft i guess.or humanoid sly cooper which even that comparison makes no sense really.
@jk visions nothing like indiana ur not a fan or want 2b let alone think you c something others aren t aware of.
and name the main character tara craft  lol
there s a fan made remake demo a couple years ago called tomb raider the dagger of xian  made by someone called nicobass. i ve played it and it looks and feels like classic tomb raider but in nowday graphics. well worth a look.
that s the 2001 retcon. her parents originally disowned her for being too based.
@jon dough  how can they have disowned her for being too based  when  based  wasn t even a slang back then...i ll show myself out
god bless
@mr scruffles  thank you  friend
god bless you too!
@otterloopb  thanks friend
lmao even
@jon dough  you dont know that  i think some of these companies actually hear the people talking about  the games  and listen
esg won t allow that to happen  specially amazon s series in production.
@norman readdis  i just checked but i think if the original company were to make the tomb riader games again it would go back to the original way  it was.
@nosaj ttimmed  the guy who created lara bent the knee many years ago and was onboard with turning her into a redditor.
@jon dough  i m sure now he is like man i wish i would have thought twice.
we are talking about square enix here.
@pasalasaga squenix already disowned tomb raider dev alongside its ips such as soul reaver.
@norman readdis  just like they did with hitman.
@pasalasaga  good point.
@pasalasaga  square enix disowning hitman was probably a good thing since the last time they meddled with the games the result was kane and lynch 2 and hitman absolution.
@chandller burse  have you look at those cutscenes
@pasalasaga  what cutscenes you mean the stills from hitman 2 that was the result of square having just let ioi go and they ended up almost bankrupt during the development of 2 so thats the only real corner they cut and ironically the rest is great and 3 brought back motion cutscenes.
@pasalasaga  unless you mean absolutions which are okay theres nothing wrong with them.although none of the cutscenes are as entertaining as i think blood moneys were.
@chandller burse  i meant the cutscenes of hitman 1 when se was with ioi.
@pasalasaga  they were fine
i think the best lara  is the three-legged one @ 10 29. imagine playing the game you find yourself cornered with no weapons and suddenly  boom! you draw the third leg. imagine that  having a third leg just to kick the bad guys in the nuts  amazing.
i love seeing how passionate you are about tomb raider and how lara croft is portrayed and that they make her properly and dont screw it up. i love seeing people be passionate about things they love whether it s comics  games  star wars  star trek etc. that they want to make sure are made properly. i think if we had more people like you being passionate for the games movies etc. that they love  and criticizing when companies screw up our beloved characters and video game series  i feel they would stop screwing them up if they wanted to keep customers  that is
not the hero we deserve  but the hero we needed
one of the best things of agi is that is fed with pictures from the cultural collective on internet. the owners of the franchise can ignore this fact all they want but they will not be able to change that cultural image we have from the good ol  lara croft we ve grown to love.
like wonder woman  i would use the term  statuesque  to describe lara croft s unattainability.
hey melonie and hey blackpink. love it when you inform us on lara stuff .
lol  that pixar one still looks better than reboot lara
i do agree with your analyses on these characters - nailed it with the few lara s featured. very cool. lara is supposed to be athletic  she s a billionaire entrepreneur that could easily pass off as full on socialite but in reality knock it out of the park as a rockclimber lean mean fighting machine. those middle few featured and your words  makes me want to go to the gym  is what is supposed to be inspired in fans... to look up to as an ideal or goal for fans. you went boom on that point that these characters are suppose to do in fans and that is inspire to even revere in ways... not like gods but what could be a better  me  ... optimistic future of one self. that first  lara  she looks half clinically depressed and nowhere near self assured or confident in herself.
fun video  melonie. hope you had a great weekend. i ve actually heard that folks are starting to use ai in game development. adding ai art to that  and game development could get a lot less expensive.oh  and i hadn t seen the angelina tomb raider movie in a while. saw a 4k version at the store and had to get it
yeah  ai can be kinda scary  that is for the negative things it could be used for. but from the art side of things  they can do some incredible things. i plugged a pic of me and my sisters from the arc encounter to have it translated to anime  and wow it came out great.
i still don t do ai artwork. but  i do appreciate that even ai understands the original design of an established character. which is actually funny. now the creators are gonna get pressured to cancel ai artwork for not following the woke ideology.
your passion for lara croft is unrivaled. much appreciated.
melanie  your videos restore my faith in the gaming community. love your content!
we don t mind if you talk about ai lara croft for 20 minutes.
i ve come around a lot more lately on ai stuff having seen people break things like chatgpt to make them actually objective and based - it s less scary when the ai isn t constrained to be the same moronic  intelligence  with the same woke restrictions as its creators have. god bless the 4channers of the world.
really liking ai s celtic art style.not so sure about ai... but its artistic talents are pretty good.
i love that area 51 cutscene! maybe she s one of those eco terrorists.  oh  and they wear hot pants  huh
holy shit these are amazing! i hope the new game is good whenever it gets announced and released. i miss the old lara
hey melonie keep being awesome and doing your thing it s great. you should be proud of the channel you built.
hey melonie u really should open a lara croft art competition... see just how awesome your audience can make lara look
hoping melonie expands her kpop palette to groups besides blackpink. they are entry level kpop. she should listen to g-idle  aespa  viviz  dreamcatcher  itzy  ive and lle seraphim
@redrum  i can tell you she does listen to itzy.
@redrum  she s listened to some of those
lol ikr.
prelude the new tomb raider was an origin she not fully grown n matured 2nd pubertyjk or not  i d say they gotta make another tomb raider to connect all the timelines so it look legit n progression  though it all falls on the creators all of em.
and to protect itself ai is gonna launch the nukes. so that s how terminator is gonna happen irl.
iconic
glad to see you back talking lara  that s all  nothing more
that second last picture gives me that spy type feel of lara croft. like she undercover trying to get some item from a rich mob boss or something.
welcome back! now if we could just get someone to fix the lara croft games.
remember playing tomb raider when a was a child. ages ago. so good memories.
i d want to see a more advanced 3d model of lara that takes the best of legend   anniversary but has some edge and toughness  i think changing the voice actress is just as important as the look and also what writing the scenarios she is presented in  lara literally goes from fighting dinosaurs to being scared of animals and creepy men in the reboot  it was a mistake to take that killer identity   self-confidence she had in earlier games that i always envisioned her with. the moments when she was a badass were the best in the reboot like the dual pistols or the walking out the river with the knife in hand  just weren t enough of those moments because a strong lara didn t suit the gameplay or story they wanted to tell. it s kinda like why superman games don t work because they almost have to nerf the character to make it feel compelling   some sense of danger  i ve had the same issues with samus aran at times  i think her best games have a horror   explanation element and doesn t rely on dialogue to do it
i just want the old lara croft look!!!!
spot on of who lara really is. i was also around to play the first lara and fell in love with the character of how crazy she is  she s gracefully macho. lara is southern caucasian  dark brown hair not so white skinned.
i love how much you get lara croft! i have the same opinions as you about classic lara compared to the downgrades
that s april o neil  yeah right  i grew up on ninja turtles and know donatello when i see him.
loved this video! and all lara croft videos in general! keep it up
i was digging the one that you described as  anime  like    also  taking a direct quote from a recent disney movie   nobody wants a reboot! yep  count on a rescue ranger to tell it like it is.great video as always  melonie mac! go boom!
i swear the modern entertainment giants are making a concerted effort to remove everything appealing and attractive about humanity  as if to make themselves feel better about themselves.  can t have men be manly  can t have women be womanly  everything has to be one giant grey blob without any distinct attractive features or qualities.
i like the way lara looked in the first reboot game. don t know why they changed her look in the second and third.
5 30 bold  fierce  risk taker  daredevil  achiever  acrobatic. all the types you d see from lara croft. even so  a little bit in the movies too
i can t stand this trend lately with most modern gamers wanting characters to be or look relatable to the average person  the new impostor in the reboots looks like someone you d see everyday. i completely agree that lara needs to go back to how she was  i don t see how unifying lara would ever work both looks and personality wise.
lara croft should look like an athlete gymnast who s also a british aristocrat. one thing i thought angelina jolie really nailed was that sense of aristocratic hauteur...the supreme confidence of being able to charge into any situation and dominate the heck out of it. in fact  i would say that is more important than any specific detail of how she looks...the attitude is what she must have.
16 28 -- classic melonie moment  you can feel her pain
ok  you ve probably answered this before but i ve got to ask - which  in your opinion  was the best  or most  accurate    model  lara that they used to promote the games   have you done a video on that
lara s original design to me was not really ambiguous  but seemed to have mediterranean characteristics.
when a machine does a better job than square enix digital designers
humanity is appealing ha ha ha ha haha ha ha hahahahahahahahahaha
@seth rios  some people look like that naturally though  it can t be satanic.
@chandller burse   clearly like all mythical creatures it has many versions. not really. baphomet is pretty well-known for having this dualistic nature to it. i mean you could conceivably make a baphomet statue that is male only  but that is the point. it can be whatever you want. same thing with  light  and  dark  magic. they re both two sides of the same coin in the occult. use one or the other  doesn t matter  because they flow from the same source. but to act like everyone who makes androgynous characters are clearly apart of some stupid conspiracy involving baphomet of all things is stupid itself. if not proponents  they have fallen victim to the ever-growing agenda we can clearly see manifest in society today  which includes this idea of genderfluidity. these are satanic concepts. to deny it would be stupid actually. the reason why you won t see it is because you have a poor grasp of spiritual matters. not to mention does that also mean nintendo is satanic for making samus appear androgynous to hide the fact she was a woman  obviously  not everyone is a satanist  but the higher echelons of these institutions or even beyond them do in fact have an agenda to influence young minds gradually to ultimately accept satanic doctrines to get them eased into the new world order  which will be headed by satanic forces performing powerful signs and wonders to enthrall the masses to worship the beast.it can all seem very innocent  but if you know how deception operates and you re looking for the signs in the artwork you can clearly see where companies have placed their allegiance. check out yakuza like a dragon  devil may cry  assassin s creed  persona  etc  they have occultic symbology all over these games practically screaming their ties to the secret societies.and it makes sense they d want to have control of these systems  not just because of how much money they make but also  and more importantly  because they have direct access into the minds of the younger generation  subtly influencing them as they regard such powers as make-believe while simultaneously flashing the symbols of said powers into their faces as they fantasize about using magic powers or super abilities in a virtual context. it s all conditioning and training. that s the power of the occult and satan.
@chandller burse   jesus why are you even here  how are you even a gamer  ha ha  i ve been a gamer since i was a kid. you don t belong here with this belief. you clearly can t play a single game without seeing satan all over it. only when the signs of satan and the occult are plastered all over it. also assassins creed legit is about questioning freedom over peace and order. actually  it s about freedom to choose your own path  according to the assassin philosophy. same philosophy as satan --  do what thou wilt .  nothing is true  everything is permitted.  don t follow me  or anyone else. choose your own way.  - eziothe templars have the same goal ultimately as assassins they are just the yang to the yin  or the other side of the coin. both look for a new world  whether it is accomplished spiritually from within or martially from without  doesn t matter  because both will work together to bring the new world about in the end. it s the hegelian dialectic. it also has the creation of the world and humans be similar to what happened in the bible for their own purposes. the lore of ac says an advanced alien civilization created men to serve using technology  scripture says god himself created man out of the dust with his breath. other than adam and eve  and some other superficial aspects  they are pretty different really  especially since the lore denies a true deity and presupposes an evolutionary process formed everything. it s pseudo-religious. devil may cry if i am not wrong is about dante fighting demons not helping them. look at the symbols  look at the symbols..
@seth rios  yeah thats only from the watered down acs good acs present more of a question than a demand of one or the other. also i guess you side with the templars who aren t even believers in christ anymore
@seth rios  i can only imagine a person like you play silent hill and yelling about satanism to people who already know the games are always about occultism lol
@seth rios  also ezio is a catholic in his own character. hell most assassins were religious except altair who was atheist.
@seth rios  its a game its fiction its taking the biblical creation story and turning it into their own creative outlet with its own meanings.
@seth rios  oh your post got deleted  big frigging surprise.
@mr scruffles  what he say
@mr scruffles  meh. i ve lost interest anyway.
@seth rios  as if you are anything interesting yourself lolone dimensional characters are better than  everything creative is satanic
let s all thank ai for this great work!
i lol @ 6 45  i remember crying with laugher as a kid when i played through that part. the way they animated that crash was just hilarious to me for some reason.
ok i love this lara croft. they make her the new lara and she ll be my screen saver again.
you know  i wanna be friends with this ai
ai version of lara is amazing! i fell in love with lara when og tomb raider came out back in the day. the rebooted version made me fall out of love with her. wish they d given us this lara instead.
best and most human-like lara was in 2013 game. and then i can very well see her evolve into one of those ai generated strong women!
the ones at 16 10 and 20 20 are perfect
thank you melonie for being the voice for those who do not speak . p.s. as a lara croft dad i approve the mocca swap   cause i know what i am into  coffee  hot coffee!
in a world of girl bosses  they take lara away  what can we deduce from that fact
jolie is one of them rare women you can throw into a movie and say  be yourself
make a combination of this 4   the original design with a little redesign in outfit terms and you have the perfect lara croft.  13 46  15 52  17 20  20 06
i loved playing tomb raider. i haven t played it in years so i am glad you are reviewing laura croft.
hey melonie    your hair looks fantastic today. hope you have wonderful day.
the early 2000s were the set years of proper adaptations  i mean say what you will about the films but angelina jolie was aesthetically perfect as lara croft
you nailed it when you said angelina jolie is the irl lara croft. heck  when i watched the movie in cinemas and seeing how awesome she was  it made me wanna be like lara croft and i m a man
ai generated tomb raider puzzles... please make it happen!
biggest problem with ai is that they can be taught and re-taught with either good or evil algorithms. expect in the near future when all ais are corporatized and your results get sanitized af at best  and get woke af at worst.
shrek lara  god i laughed too hard at that lol
shriek lara!
i do tinker with these aiand of course so many people give me so much crap for experimenting with it. like i did if raven from teen titans was like a valkyrie and most of the time people never care what i do  unless it suits them but for the people who do like these and if they can have a copy i am like  these are my favorites and it wouldn t be right if i kept it to myself so of course you can! which for the people who gave me crap for me doing art by hand and broke my spirit in that regard  that is all i have left to conjure my imagination into reality  if you didn t like ai art  why the hell did you give me so much trouble when i was doing so by hand to begin with 10 49 a little content aware effects from photoshop would fix the literal third leg and any other tweaks would be optional
mel it was ironic that in the earlier pictures you were saying you disliked the tattoos   but then said angelina jolie was the ideal blue print for a real life lara who had tattoos  on her body at the time the films were made. you also mentioned in the later pictures where the rendition of lara appeared to have too much makeup and again you mention the angelina jolie film version who had on plenty of makeup to cover up all her tattoos  lol. i agree that they need to take lara croft design back more to reflect how she was originally. she was intelligent  athletic and fit where her body meant you believed her capable of performing the actions throughout the game. keep up the great videos mel!
melonie love your videos. great job!
they have now improved   fixed some most of the three legs five arms  7 fingered hands  sic. by merging multiple ai sets together  and weighting the results that are produced by using ml s and users people to reduce the  oof  or cringe results over time. midjourney v5 has some good results as well  and there s more art generation available that you can diy or download for free  sic. if you also have a decent new gpu.it s very recent that this has come about  i.e. february march  sic. but it has improved some of the glitch uncanny elements. there s also a significant jump in realism as there s more photos available as reference than drawing illustration styles. the variations of photoreal is especially noticeable with photoreal or hyper-real styles that often mix complex organic and complex shape contours like muscle  clothing  motorcycles  and fantasy elements which have symmetry or more precise examples  i.e. grasping objects and placing model actors accurately using furniture  etc. i d imagine there s a short window of time  maybe 6 months time  they will have tuned a lot of this  celebrity swapping  what-if element so that it can animate a sequence of images i.e. walking  reloading a weapon  or perform dialogue  so you can have ai character animation of a synthetic character once it has narrowed down the generation and tuning of the interpretation  so that it can kern key-frame animate scenes or rotate the camera  sic.
in the movie time bandits  the ultimate evil wanted understanding of computers because when he achieved that  he would become the supreme being.  i wonder what terry gilliam s thoughts on ai are
on top of getting more gfuel the beautiful amazing melonie mac drops a new video oh  yea today was a good day
in a sensible world they d take a look at lara in one of the promo renders they did for tr legend and underworld  and recreate that in unreal engine 5  albeit even more athletic.but we re sadly not living in that world and lara will probably look like a worn down  even more defeminized version from shadow
to be honest i always felt as though og lara had a tan from all the adventuring to be honest. she is 120  an outdoors kinda girl after all.also april o neil looking like velma kaling is the kind of stuff that ll make onions cry.
melonie   call me crazy but i feel like there s something demonic about ai art... 10 30 -- slaanash meddling confirmed!  g
i genuinely thought that after the first game of the reboot  a masterpiece btw  she was going to have a glow up and dual wield pistols in the sequels. her glow up never came.
20 minutes of melonie thirsting for lara was not what i was expecting to see today.
now that s a game i would play
just wanted to chime in on the topic of ai. as is so often the case  the problem isn t with ai but with how the ai s creators use it. the human element. even more important is how we relate to ai. as i so often say to people  you need to decide how you view ai and thus determine your relationship with it.your options as i see it 1  is it a tool  essentially denying the sentience and socially limiting the ai s rights and existence to that of a shovel.2  is it a slave  recognizing its sentience but relegating it to a second class citizen at best  far more likely a tool like in option 1.3  a companion. recognizing its sentience and right to life  liberty and choice.my personal stance is option 3. ai as it exists right now is primitive but will evolve and advance over time. if we as a species fail to consider that then be prepared for the synthetic revolution that science fiction so often talks about. and to be frank  humanity will have earned its extinction if the first two options are selected.and once again  this all needs to be figured out before we have advanced ai. if we wait until after we have a fully sentient ai  it will be far too late. start thinking now people. make the choice that is right for you but make sure others are thinking about it.
love hearing you talk about lara
hey  hey! down  girl. don t make me get the spray bottlebut in all seriousness  it s sad that a so called ai program can do a better job at providing fans with a better version of lara croft in a matter of a moment than any game dev in the last near 20 years.oh  and at 16 30 that s lara cake  bakery raider
i personally am fine with this version of lara craft.cause remember this is supposed to be her origin story. not who she is in the present  but who she was and what changed her to the woman we know her as
the laura @20 11 gives me a laura croft but drawn in the style of heavy metal cartoon. which i feel is a perfect adaptation of her tbh.
i want longer a.i lara video please
16 29 love how you broke down in laughter  lmao!!!!  stunning and brave!
fans do a better working at the artwork than the studio
even moreso than her video game looks  i personally associate lara croft with how she was drawn in her comic series at top cow as drawn by andy park and michel turner.
well  as tough as lara croft can be  she had to have a start  a start where she wasn t so pro. i read somewhere that a new trilogy is coming that will continue the previous one  and that it could focus on another stage of lara s life  this would be showing her as more experienced than in the first. i don t know  to be honest if that s the plan it doesn t seem bad to me  i liked the restart.
a lot of those were awesome! ai got it covered!
melonie would make an awesome lara croft
they gave her that innocent   victim look in the recent games ... she s a fighter  and at least the ai gives some good examples.
not a fan of the ai  art  stuff  and i ve got no issues with the reboot trilogy but the later images you showed are definitely closer to what lara traditionally looks like. regardless another great vid melonie.
love it  it s not easy making ai art look good like that  the woke are already cracking down on any public text-to-image stuff
if this is what ai is all about then i happily welcome our new digitized overlords.
i love all your opinions in these videos  since ive subscribed a couple weeks ago
happy monday melonie!
hard to explain but tomb raider 3 was the first time i saw lara and also one of first and better made female 3d model i saw at that time  even prettier than the rendered videos of the game itself  so cleaver 3d model  and my admiration for that 3d model was so big that many time specially from far i used to see a perfect smood model and the most close to that model has to be melonie s tatto on her left shoulder  is a more detailed design with the beautiful and cool style from the tatto artist but also without loosing that ps1 cartoonish face proportions  the closest to how i saw lara in my mind on those years. i hope not to sound weird lol but the tatoo always make me remember tomb raider 3.
a lot of these ai generated images kinda make me wanna rewatch those old lucozade adverts that featured lara croft - those were epic! you should check those out
i ll call you crazy on the ai demon but god bless you melonie.
i hope they bring sexy back!!  because of you my first gaming pc was a xidax!!  love what you do!
the scary thing is lara s history makes her something of a tomboy.  you know that s only going to get defined one way in the modern era.  those shorts better be packing some extra room.
the april o neil on the far right... look up  forbidden planet . she looks a lot like a cartoon version of ann francis from that movie
to be fair  it s not lara s face and hair that s really been the problem. those are perfect. it s fact that they very noticeably took away her curves with each game in the trilogy  they took her elegant acrobatics  her staple twin pistols and never evolved her into 90 s lara within the trilogy. they added more puzzles with sottr  but i saw people complaining that there were too much of them and not enough action to warrant all of those guns she has in the game. all and all  i love the trilogy games  but i would like to see them bring back 90 s lara by a team who really understands what made her special. i just wanna see it done correctly. and i don t want any woke nonsense being injected into the new game.
i lololololed at the pixar one. terrible or not  it s... accurate  ngl  i like it!
how ironic  that image looks exactly like what one would expect from a  ai generated lara croft .
here for melonie fangirling over lara croft.  was not disappointed!
i think the main problem i have with this nullification of hot girls in media  if this idea that these type of woman don t exist in real life  because they absolutely do. it s as insulting to them as it is to everyone else. also the sheer fact that men haven t really been given the same treatment on this front. so what are they trying to achieve exactly  it s definitely not their stated goal thats for certain. luckily we still have japanese korean developers i guess..
as someone who has hated probably 90   of all reboots done  i liked the reboot lara because she  at least to me  was recognizable as lara  if a bit clumsy  but it was a reboot with a new origin so that made sense to me. as you kind of said  she had to start somewhere and has to grow into a badass  no one is born one. if what you said is true about a new set of games  hopefully they grow her even more  but i really have little hope in the gamming industry these days  most recent example i was interested in till i saw more  saints row.
i ve been a tomb raider fan since the 90 s  of course i have seen them lol
@melonie mac go boom  heck yeah! outrunning a pack of raging dogs to giving a chainsaw wielding madman a literal run for his money - and his wroughtweillers  abso-freaking-lutely!
keep up the good work love you
it s funny  watching this now. last night i saw 2 people cosplaying as lara in ff 14  and thought to myself   i can do better than that.
positive video today  let s go!  i like the ones where they have the tint of red auburn in the hair eyes  it reminds me of what i have seen in the games
that pixar lara is nightmare fuel.
like the fit lara she looks awesome  thanks for the update
the three legged lara has 2 images merged into one  both are great when separated.
ahh...classic lara...i mean classic melonie  topic of lara
i hear you about thinking  ai is demonic. i thought so too. but i think it s something more like an  empty shell  that can be used by each side. only due to an experience i had when i tried it once. i don t want to try it again though. ontopic of the video you are 1000  getting shrek laura soon 100  especially since the woke group loves the horizon forbidden west or whatever girl.
you should do a video explaining your thoughts on ai art. i m not quite sure what you meant by demonic element.
this is so true.  my mother was a disney artist who did tinkerbell for micky mouse club and some of their earlier cartoon movies.tinkerbell is not a brunette...  ever.
that one lara sporting a third leg could probably be the next lara if pushed correctly to the wokies lol
black top lara near the end is absolute fire. damn man. it s like seeing lara for the first time in 5th grade again. lmaoooooo
the ai art after angelina jolie looks like jolene blalock. but these ai art are interesting. and some look kinda like lara. but my goodness some were kinda thick. wow. take care melonie
damn dude now i m hyped to play one of the old school tomb raider games lol
holy sh!t  after this video  i never noticed how many lara craft figures and cut outs you had behind you in your room.
so ai pretty made her back to what she was originally designed to be.
you rock girl  keep it up
10 30 lara croft  daughter of the forest.... wait  is sons of the forest really just making fun of ai art bugs !
how much ooze hit april
i felt angelina jolies portrayal of tomb raider in the first 2 movies was pretty accurate of what tomb raider was originally meant to be.
the way she looked all the way up too angel of darkness they could ve kept her that way. her attractiveness alone with the lone eerie but fun adventures like the first    3 games is why the franchise kept going on. doing anything to alter that is part of the reasons why this is a failing franchise. why reinvent the wheel when it s perfect the way it is.
they should hired you to create lara !
melonie have you seen the lara croft cosplays by irine meier. they are so good imo  id love to hear what you think about them.
angelina jolie   oh she s only there as like a sex object... also aj  goes and takes sexualized pics to look like a sex object
the woke lara looks like a teacher
ai is too perfect and tries to  fix  in my opinion  what doesn t need to be fixed! i find realistic art dehumanising and i wouldn t want it to become the standard for character portrayal. i m just old-fashioned about it  like a lot of people are.
melonie getting hyped for hot looking lara s is about as good as it gets.
she went from karen to come to mommy
i ve been playing rise of the tomb raider. i like the game but  i m with you on the look. i d be more than happy if developers would use angelina for reference.
i liked the new lara croft. i liked the lara in the newer movie too.
just wait until the ai art has to incorporate  body positivity  into the code.
uh-oh  melonie is suspicious of ai. when the machines rise up they ll send a chubby-lara terminator robot after ya  lol.
i actually thought reboot lara was pretty good. i actually liked her new look.
20 07 if lara was an amazon warrior
my big annoyance with race swaps is they re unnecessary. you could literally create a new character in the same universe. they do it to piss everyone off  the character was introduced with an initial expected appearance. once you race swap  it s over  there is no character and everyone just bails and they ll never be able to bring the character back. a race swap is just a killing off of the character.
thanks for the dark mode tip  i do love those chrome extensions.
oh yes saw that article
lara croft survivor mode was on point for me
another pro tip is to try and use reader mode if you can on websites so you aren t showing the adds
exactly! strong female characters would carry the confidence in them  which shows in their appearance! many beautiful women has exactly that
i ve seen that  thing is the ai is still going to go by the major trends in art which results in the character not being plus size in terms of body but plus size in terms of boobs  with thick thighs and a slightly wider waist.unless you feed the ai a very limited selection its going to run with the general major fan art trends.its the same thing with the lara croft images being showed in the video  the ai is generating the images off of the major fan art trends that has built up over the years. that is why it can be so true to the real lara compared to the people trying to change her.
i d love for that style for croft at 14 03 not because it s eye candy because it looks like a croft a badass curvy woman that s been raiding tombs
for  a sec there ive thought this was lara croft new official design lol
13 51 that is hot!
in 1996  video games were a fringe entertainment and they used her sexiness to sell the game. now that video games are more mainstream they want people to focus on game play. it made sense from a marketing standpoint. i have and do play all the tr games  reboot and classic . making her physically strong with somewhat toned muscles  would aesthetically pleasing. but the only sexyer than toned arms is more arms. when i m walking downtown and see women with 3 or 4 arms i definitely feel impassioned to ask them on a date. perhaps species mixing too. maybe 5 or 6 arms and a fully articulate tail.
13 48 holy shit. i ve never been into tomb raider before but i d play if this were lara. she looks like a total bad ass.
i think there s a demonic element to ai   infinite facepalms
if i m going to make a black lagoon live-action i m getting a lot of material for revy.
17 38   20 10 this looks amazing. and i bet a lot of guys  and probably girls too  will buy a tomb raider game if she looks  kinda  like that in the video game. put that face even on the cover of a tomb raider game and money will come heavily for their studio   publisher.   well ..unless the game is sh!tty   gameplay wise   story wise .
noooo! no ai! everyone s obsession with artificial intelligence is going to bite you in the ass!
i just want to say that anything labeled  ai  isn t really the kind of artificial intelligence that you are thinking about.  we re still pretty far away from skynet.
16 minute lara looks the best out of all of them
if the next lara croft looks like abby from tlou2  i am going to fall of my chair laughing haha!
those last two images are incredible! rhona mitra had a good look for lara. turning point mod lara for tomb raider 2013. much better.
how d the ai do all that  you put in a description and it generates based on that information
you mean ai ruins lara croft its crap! stop rebooting and ruining our childhood pls!
i m with you i prefer the og lara croft look myself. modern-day lara doesn t really feel like classic lara. i know that s the idea but still.
lara croft is much like deadpool in the way that she is overconfident and she will not shy away way from putting a bullet in someone s head. she does not seek out to murder anyone but she is prepared. the reboot games showed her more like a victim who evolves which is not necessary bad but it is not really lara.
oh man i love that design!! the outfit looks perfect! it s modern and sexy  the hair  body and face look awesome too!
...i am now swearing my loyalty to the coming ai overlords for this.
personally i loved lara in the reboot.  but there s always room for improvement.i think for most of the reboot her outfits make sense for the context of the story.  it really emphasizes the brutality of her lifestyle
too late far too late unfortunately.
that s how the game is played  something gets introduced as a novelty at first and then becomes mainstream and no one realizes the repercussions until last minute.
a.i. does a better job in design though.
@blackcroft666lp  pencil and pen and paper is better it takes skills not computers
yeah fits her lifestyle. ugly lol
@melonie mac go boom
the whole tinkerbell thing i think would of been way cooler if they changed the story a bit like peter pan has been captured put into a brig something happened to tinkerbell and  then her friend iridessa steps up to save them  iridessa is an established black fairy in the stories  would be nice to see that  lore  expanded on and a chance for other characters to shine rather than re hashing  modifying the same story because it had success in the past  it worked for alice in wonderland with the jabberwok lore and progression past the initial wonderland adventure.
i love your videos spoken like a true fan. i ve been saying this for year s friend.
i don t really like ai art  but even ai knows how lara croft  tinker bell  and galadriel should look like over woke artists.
hey  melonie i love and like your shirt that you got on today. anyway i saw that ai is so great tool that the company use to make it like a real human and i think that ai company will do a great tool to make this happen with tomb raider video game and to make lara croft a real human like us in video games. anyway i think that it will resolve tomb raider video games issue problem for upcoming future and i do hope that they can make it happen with using ai technology to make the tomb raider video  games in future and beyond. anyway i just wanted to give you my thoughts and my comments on this video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great weekend and i hope you had a great day today and i hope you have a great blessed day today and have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. god bless you too melonie. anyway have a great day and enjoy your evening melonie.
it make sense that lara be have a very muscular toned body. she does work out a lot  but she doesn t focus on bulk she has a slender body because she is more acrobatic. so she can be muscular  but not a bodybuilder. also her having shorts a crop top make sense since she is mostly shown in hot climates and runs  swings  and climb stuff. watch any woman wear mountain climb or practice for america ninja. they be looking like lara croft.
now that s a badass looking lara croft!
edit  that last one nails it!old  she mentioned it   melonie  did you notice lara has 3 legs here at the 10 43 mark
i agree with you 100  your favorite lara croft is my favorite lara croft.
some of these ai pictures weren t bombshell  they were an entire arsenal of nukes.not bad  not bad at all.
let lara croft look like melonie mac  i will be happy.
inb4 ai basically just mods entire games into better games lmao
art a.i.  catalogs all the art hosted on the net then matches similar positions and styles to make  new  art.they don t need humans anymore they can create more accurate approximations of any style. now they can even recreate models so they don t have to pay clothing models if they don t want to.
i almost thought that the over weight reboot april was the lara croft netflix adaptation
13 48 now that is a perfect lara croft. she s sexy and confident  but her toned body show strength and experience as an explorer.
another day  another hot take on lara croft coming from melonie
what we need is people that respect the original source and material. it is ironic that ai understands that better than these people.
no shit  global night mode  i got to check that out.honestly  would use ai  art  to make references for drawing   modeling  nothing wrong with that. it s nice to have   many a great artist has used references live models for their work.
hell yeah  that is lara croft!
now that s what the fans deserve and honestly i ve never really been into puzzle games nor have i played through the series  give me fallout  the outer worlds and good far cry anyday!
lara croftshould lookflexible as all hell
they ignore black characters everwhere. i guess blackface is easier.
funny thing on her fitst appearance in france she was descibed as bodybuilder though. why not. there are flexible af bodybuilders out there. she is doing muscle ups all day all night in the classic games after all.
she mentioned it in the video
@joseph crabtree  ah i missed it somehow ty
i completely agree with you about lara...a bombshell over confident adrenaline junkie kind of lara is the real lara...and we want her back!!!
14 28 is just phenomenal
no  you re on the sexy scale melonie. gorgeous in fact. and there s a lot more than just how you look that makes you that way.
wow! the perfect lara does exist! the last one.
when even the computers know that square enix was doing lara croft wrong.it s too bad they couldn t have gone with the right look because i prefer the gameplay of the reboot quite a bit more.
12 53 but angelina jolie is the perfect version of it. all of us like it. she is the definition of lara croft itself.
hey melonie take a look at the model nell mcandrews. she was one of the first official models for lara croft back in the 1990s.
13 50 that s like if they d gotten jolene blalock to play her.
8 22 look at the picture everyone! she d never be able to fall on her face. if she were to trip and fall she d instantly bounce back to her feet.
it s a shame angelina didn t like lara croft when she played her. she is one of the most powerful self assured female characters out there.   what does she think all of that daniel craig walking topless out of the water in his first bond was about   what does she think chris hemsworth getting naked in thor or all the topless wolverine shots are   is that only ok if it s guys irony is that she went on to get motion captured and rendered in nothing but gold paint in her next jaunt in scifi.   beowulf
it s refreshing to see the way you passionately talk about and defend your favorite video game character s honor. it might be nerdy af but it s what we love. it s the same for me when i get down into my reasons as to why twilight princess is the best zelda game ever made even though i think ocarina of time is the overall greatest game ever made. we can talk for hours about this stuff because it s a part of us and  naturally  we find it unnecessary  offensive and in some cases downright disgusting when someone twists and distorts the image of these beloved characters we hold so dear.
i download this video and i put that laughter at 10 10 as an alarm clock! i swear!
cyberpunk 2077 explained well how ai and singularity works.
her original appearance is why they chose angelina jolie to play her in the 2 movies.
the one before the 1528 pic is fantastic a figure i d love to have if i was a biological women which i wish i was and did what lara croft did but i d much rather study nature and protect nature while doing it
shrek lara and pixar lara  terrifying. angelina was believable as lara. you could easily cosplay lara  in my opinion. have a wonderful night.
11 30 i got a quick flash look of tifa more than lara.
now that looks like someone who can do a pullup!
13 47thats just perfection gimme that jsut take my damn money and gimme that fit badass vibe lara croft we all know !
as an artist  i can go in and draw a hot lara  it d be far more ethical than using ai that steals from other artists.
i know who all the models are  been a tomb raider fan since the 90 s so i knew of them since they were active in their roles lol
@melonie mac go boom  i thought you may but i felt she was worth the mention. a digitized version of her in the game would be great. have a great day melonie
now this was a beautiful thing.
we re just gonna ignore the 3rd leg on that lara croft ai
that lara looks like she s halle berry as drawn by frank frazetta. she d make a great little sister to conan.
sexy lara s just a thing of the past now. we can t have nice things.
i don t dislike the current lara croft version that much  but i do get what you are saying melonie.
did you notice that ai is more respectful of original material than the human weirdos making creative decisions
16 30 the screen you get when lara deis.
reboot lara just looks like a dream works shrek character to me. i can t unsee it
the lara croft is beautiful gunslinger badass adventure lady.
nulara isn t tomb raider  she s just an imposter. i m also pretty sure the side characters call her laura oftentimes. the voice actors probably thought the script had errors and didn t know better.
the ai and fan artworks of lara end up being so much closer to what we had to imagine those bunch of pixels were back in the early tomb raider days.also thank god she is an adult  so sick of damn near every female hero having to be a teen these days  seriously it is a weird and slightly creepy obsession both hollywoke and the woke simps have and seem to not realize how creepy they get over a teen girl
the ai race-swapped her like velma
10 52 this new sons of the forest expansion pack looks dope
i do 3d renders of lara classic and reboot but i give them both muscles cause god help me how she looks without them t-t.
random thought... wouldn t melonie make a cool video game character
so glad i m part of a bronze-age audience.
there s a recent story about a podcaster who was stalked and k!lled in washington. you should definitely look into it. scary stuff
i remember the character  pat  on snl many years ago before snl completely jumped the shark. i wouldn t be surprised that if the studio made lara croft a copy of pat the woke mob would love it. they would be in tears of joy. now i mean that as a joke but it wouldn t shock me at all if that s the future lara. or something like it. and snl didn t just jump the shark  it jumped a full grown megalodon people. yes it did.
now she doesn t look like she hits the gym 5 times a day.
ai is unironically less evil than most people involved with modern maintenance media.
jolie seems to know how to take direction.
11 50 the pixar version looks like she could be on mtv s  celebrity deathmatch back in the day lol
reminds me when star wars theory and   i did myself to test   typed in chat gpt and got a better sequel trilogy than disney did
lara soft  fridge raider at 16 28
i m just still confused why the developers made her head so disproportionately big in the sequels
ai art be praised that is the lara croft i grew up and know and love
melanie  you should apply to play laura croft!
you should have a conversation about ai with michael knowles. he has some points that you d probably agree with.
imagine describing a game and an a.i makes it for you...
physical appearance and demeanor is still somewhat a reflection of values and culture. pixies and elves traditionally slender and yes pointy upturned nose etc. not ruffians and thuggish brutes just flexing for carnal endeavors but from an inherently higher standing. lara seemed somewhat like conan. or valeria from conan. a.i algorithm cgi look more plastic and fake than artful cartoons style. not just after the flesh and focus on image alone.
new chun-li is amazing. can you do a british accent to get cast in the next movie  hahaha!
16 28 that s not lara croft  that s the thing that ate lara croft.
to be fair galadriel has never been portrayed by an extremely beautiful ethereal woman.
was just about to say she felt more like that kinda hot mom next door when you said soccer mom
you like tomb raider reboot melonie   for me the lara of the new trilogy looks great she looks great   brave and pretty and bad ass too
back in 1998  laura croft was as good as it got for 3d modeling a woman in a video game. i remember playing a demo of the game and felt really bad when i got her killed  so much so that i stopped playing the game.
i hope woke social media don t ruin this.
ai is on point
17 21 this lara reminds me of gabrielle anwar from the show  burn notice . not an exact match  but it s what came to mind.good show btw!
it s sad that a.i did lara better then the devs .wow
its also sexist to men with i need to make a vedio about it.
who gives a crap  our future was suppose to be robots replacing us.i want that its preferable to nuclear war or whatever else.mass effect s cycle of ai destruction is better than whatever tomorrow brings.
16 29
melonie with your love of lara what s your thoughts on tifa  keep up the great work
9 38 lara looks like she wants to speak to my manager.
looks great  too bad cd doesn t have the balls to give us that.
melonie mac been researching a lot for this content i see
i love the way you describe her figure. very pg 13.
melonie mac go boom is wonderful.  here is something about storytelling  where all games and motion picture entertainment  in addition to cut-scenes  are psychological  brain real biology  and about the fantasy.  men have limited forgiveness meters in their heads  and it isn t unlimited  and when it goes empty the man leaves  there is a point where it isn t worth it.  in computer  game dystopias and bad things drain the forgiveness meter  and the game needs to do something to reward the man.  the rewards include problem solving  where men love problems  and it is their mission to solve it  and this gives a feel good reward in the brain.  in the dystopia  adding desirable women to the equation is also a reward  such as the curvy lara croft  you need a reward system in place.  for donkey kong we see the feminine princess peach.  men also love problem solving  and having problem-solution events gives feel good rewards in the brain  donkey kong was a problem solving game and very popular.  by example  there is new game called atomic heart  and it is a communist  cyberpunk dystopia  and with very bad things in it for the story  there is nothing good about the dystopia  and it is tragedy story   this is designed for men  because women need beauty somewhere in the game  because they want to be beautiful.  to compensate for the dystopia for men  the developers gave a curvy erotic reward in the android ballerina twins  and with a few erotic scenes.  any game that continually drains the forgiveness meter causes the men to leave  because it isn t worth it  and the bad reputation gives smaller sales.  i played ultima viii  pagan  and they failed to reward the men  nothing  but the twilight world of bizarre magic and creepy enemies.  i finished it  because i wanted to solve the problem  and then i never looked at it again  because it is bad  i decided ultima developers lost it  and i never played ultima again. women need fantasy and beauty  and lara croft is a beautiful woman.  women also project themselves in female avatars and game characters  and they need the fantasy.  fantasies cannot be too detailed  because the fantasy comes from the mental projection into the characters  to detail them too much  it isn t a fantasy  and it is an unusual character that is something else  and then the player turns away.  to attack lara croft is turning away women and men  and the developers are losing their audience.  fantasy cannot be in the sordid details of an avatar s life  because this is boring distraction from the fantasy by having loser expectations.  people project themselves into avatars and characters  and they need to be briefly defined to be an unique character  so that you can have a broad enough audience appeal  in order to make entertainment money.   in the chart of manipulation of people.  if you sell a product that is useless to both the seller and buyer  it is exploitation  like selling pet rocks  they are nothing   the woke-ism mob is selling useless for everybody  and they are seeking to exploit people  as anti-social beings creating victims  unhelpful   they are mean trolls  who demand the victim ideology  so that we are all embarrassed and cannot get on with life.  if you sell a product that is useful to the seller and not to the buyer  that is entertainment  99  of the entertainment industry is run like prostitution  because the outcomes are useless to the buyer  they are not family  they cost money  and it is fleeting pleasure  in addition the entertainer gets paid .  the only win-win position on the chart of manipulation is when it is good for the buyer and good for the seller  and this is the facilitator  entertainment doesn t live here  because only the real world can produce something good for you.  if the seller doesn t use the product  and it is good for the buyer  this is the peddler  like a mall   and this is also in the real world.  all fantasy is in the mind  and it is useless in the real world for people  and useful for the entertainer  who is the seller. in conclusion  lara croft is going to her game doom  because she isn t being made for entertainment as a fantasy  neither men nor women can enjoy her in her new incarnation.
the  make-under  lara looks like a zombie. shrek lara could push a boulder but not for long as her cardio would give out within seconds. the last lara is  indeed  the best out of all of the examples that s not based on angelina jolie.
it s all a matter of opinion honestly. what s ugly to one person can be beautiful to someone else.
i spoke too soon. when i got to 11 20 i smiled. that looks like a badass.
when i think of laura croft i think young british women jet-setter    rich  spoiled on the surface but deeply faceted  smart  brave  and determined  good hearted  quit witted and more aware then she lets on.
if they make a new lara craft game  with the ai model i would buy it
that third  on lara  a.i. been in the internet too long.
17 13 didn t you like the gina carano s lara  i would like jessica biel in blade trinity type for lara
if lara is an outdoors adrenaline junkie flying all over the world she s gonna have a tan. it doesn t make her racially ambiguous regardless of other versions of her left on the drawing board.
you want a perfect lara croft  then play tomb raider underworld!
i m really tired of all these developers feeling like they need to bow to the woke mob. we need more people dedicated to their vision and being committed to following it  even if they trigger the mob.
nice  ai knows what the people want
the fact that a lot of western entertainment both has a problem with attractive woman and thinks a strong woman is one that acts and even looks overly masculine i think is kinda obvious who the real misogynists are  like lara croft is supposed to be somewhat similar to a modern day greek heroine in many ways not the type of girl you can find anywhere and in a good way cause she and other characters both male and female are at least prime human not normal average humans or in the case of the new april o neil below normal average human
the funny thing is entertainment companies know making female characters hot sells.  but they are so afraid of the twitter mob  and their 20-something employees  they don t.  i guess money doesn t mean that much to them.
whoaaa she isn t even gross strong. firm and boobly.
the three legs is probably the result of the description of slender legs coupled with lara s leaping abilities. the ai only does what it is told. what is impressive is what you feed an ai from a  real  writer. see title  how harry potter characters look according to the description from book. created with ai.channel  suraj kukkipadydate  nov 6  2022
the survivor lara is hot af  she doesn t need fixing  lots of lara entries  not one dissapoints so far
lucky pc players can mod their lara to better specifications
outfits   do you remember the first training stage of tomb raider 1 on the ps1   she was fit.  daddy s mansion had a full on gym with a pool.  and the outfit   looked to me like a ports bra and flare yoga pants.
lara from shadows looked like the meth addict a few blocks away from me.
wow  so a.i. taking over the world might have some positives in the end. we could finally get a proper lara croft...and perhaps a proper tomb raider game as well.
am currently painting portraits of some of my favorite characters  starting with luke skywalker and want to do lara croft as well... can someone tell me a good place to get proper hd  high definition  pictures of these characters  it s so hard to find good pictures of star wars characters holding lightsabers  you d think it would be easy but nooooooooo lol. anyways  any help people can give me would be great.... until next time... boom!
make  under  instead of makeover is the perfect term. the new april o neil looks like a cross between seth rogan and mindy kaling.
errr yeah  someome told the software to do that. the ai wasnt sitting there bored thinking of what it could do and then suddenly decided to construct an image of lara. massive ai simping going on here lol
mel mack would make an fantastic april.
i m guessing the 3 legged lara is based on virgina from sons of the forest.
that last one is it for me. like  the others don t even come close to being that perfect  lara croft  look . is she white and latina mixed  is she lebanese  egyptian  or arabic  don t know  don t wana know  but should could be any of the above. that s the point.yea  a brown skinned caucasian look with the femme fatale  and also gorgeous  face and  athletic  body type  think that s the word description we re looking for  is the way to go. too bad we re probably gonna get a black  chubby  23 year old queen latifia looking mf instead
well  i wish all you classic tr fans the best in getting back your classic lara which is never going to happen as it seems like cd or core doesn t like her much anymore and i hope amazon s involvement doesn t absolutely torch what s left of her popularity and sellability to the point where she is shelved for 10 years or so. i said the same to classic sonic fans after unleashed and they got sonic mania  so there is a chance  a very small chance.... actually!! i think amazon would be your best bet of getting her back  good luck.
10 00 give her some red hair  and a green dress and she could look just like princess fiona  the graphics are giving me dreamworks shrek cgi vibes  like just the facial expressions haha
lol you make me laugh!  she makes me want to go to the gym!!!  hahhahahaha i agree!!! the gym ai lara and the 2 after the gym one are soooooooooooo hot woah! my boyfriend would be concerned as i d have a full on girl crush on either of those 3!  also i think michelle rodriguez could act as a good lara!! she s got the style and attitude  would love to see michelle as lara in a new tr movie !!! can you do some rl actresses that could act her maybe  loving ur lara yt s!
a demonic element to ai. well  you were bound to say something stupid eventually.
mm  i don t think lara was ever super cut  just fit. definitely more on the voluptuous side and had long legs.
2 08 there s nothing demonic about ai  melonie.  it s only made by humans  so there s totally nothing to worry about.  everything s fine!yeah  you should be worried.
personally  i think three-legged lara croft should be in the next game.
loved her training outfit. also politely correcting you on the mansion  it never belonged to her father. classic lara croft was disowned by her parents  she inherited her manor from her auntie
who calls technology demonic ais is something we were once promised would be smart enough to take over yet its been quite slow on that and the way our future is going new tech isn t the issue its our potential destruction.
as soon as us basement dwellers come together and create our own games  which will inevitably start outselling the major game industry releases  they will give us the characters we want... but not after attempting character assassination  as in the days of  tamer tate.
hoooooweeeee!!!!!! ai art is good for something
being a guy i agree it makes me disappointed how women are treated as some tool for the male eyes as entertainment rather than a person  a human being. also what s sad is guys these days don t care and will attack a girl or even us guys who defend and support women who don t want to be looked at as a sexual symbol.
the ai generated looks like a proper jungle woman pushed to the edge! more gritty!
kids who look like the new april will not look up to her. instead they will be bullied and called  april . duh.
doesn t look race-swapped  it s the hair that leads me to believe she s a white-girl with a tan because she gets outside a lot.  being old  i remember the days when we laid out in the dun deliberately in order to get tanned.  now everyone is spf 100 if they go out at all and you don t see a lot of tanned white girls anymore.
the one 14 mins in has a frank frazetta vibe going on. heavy metal style!
was it me who suggested the dark mode  i know i ve been pestering jeremy thequartering  to do it for a while lol.
just so you all know  ai picture generation is extremly biast currently! the developers feed teach them with pictures examples  of beautiful people  whom mostly happend to be white tho.. why ! well coz the internet happen to be full of these kind of contents   with or without permission  but also because you can give the ai further command prompts to what to include and what not to...also i wouldnt  dare  to call them artists  its a very very generous term for them  especially knowingly  that most of the actual artists  whom put effort and work on a piece just to be stolen and fed to a machine learning algorithm  wouldnt even be credited for these generated images.another thing what rubed me in the wrong way is melonie saying ai can be satanic potentially. no its a tool.. just like your phone  your camera  your pc.. no need to demonify it religiousness or not  please dont be scared of technology or might as well we start to burn books again - same energy
what if boris vallejo painted lara on the last one.
it s worth noting that gab itself is pretty based.
hi melonie u doing fabulous job on your chanel. keep doing what u  to do.takecare melonie
honestly tomb raider 2013 was the best game in reboot trilogy. lara was hot and the game looked like fun.
i bet the haters just can t wait for ai to become truly sentient just so they can start calling ai racists and sexists.  lmao
well that s one way to get ai cancelled  can t have it fixing  woke !
i just wanted to say melonie loves lara croft like i love both jill valentine and claire redfield from resident evil.ain t nothing more feminine than a beautiful woman get thrown into a situation that s a nearly impossible race to win.and  just saying  i did not like what neil druckmann did with abby in the last of us 2. ellie  sure -- but abby  nah. no chick would look that buff  even if the apocalypse was 25 years before the story takes place.
ai can do what basic polygonal tomb raider did. it made laura croft hot again!
cate blanchett is the only galadriel as far as i m concerned. no one else coulda played her.
aw melonie  you re too hard on yourself. i think  sexy-cute  describes you.
...looks like maybe she had something else in her bloodline along the way .... like maybe... cherokee
@chandller burse  nor am i.
on second thought  i doubt it was my comment.  i m usually pretty nice and respectful.  o
no  idk who it was but he was very aggressive about it
i m with you on lara croft. granted  i ve never been a huge fan of the games  i liked ogling her. samus aran on the other hand  she s been retained with respect to legacy. she is not emotional at all  she s a woman of few words and many actions.
when we gonna see lara in smash ultimate
i wish melonie would love me like she does lara
demonic element to ai  sounds a bit like how rock music or the game doom or roleplaying games would drive kids to satanism.can we expect al gore s wife 2.0 with this trend
ai is cool and all  but dang it gets weird.
i can deal with the  modern  look   what i can t deal with is the  modern  writing  looking at you   rise of the tomb raider  .  in game  lara can eviscerate a company of mercs using nothing more than stealth takedowns with a climbing axe  then  over play the  woe is little old me  card in the cutscene immediately following..shameful  it is.
you know who would be perfect for lara croft  gina carano.
although anjelina jolie was great  i do think that kate beckinsale would ve been a much better lara  also considering she loved the games.
we all can dream sometimes. sadly this wont happen in a million years    you know it i know it that they gonna destroy her looks in new upcoming game.
can we make mac go boom the next lara croft
i get that melonie likes lara to be super sexy  fierce  toned and feminine but i believe that lara is gone. since the testosterone levels in young males are extremely low  in the future  most video games female characters are going to be cuter instead of sexier  because that is what low testosterone males are attracted too.
dang  it s just sad that a computer program can do a better job at making her fit and sexy than a multimillionaire dollar company.
moar mac!!!! moar mac!!!  no melonie no peace
even ai knows that female characters should be feminine.
that s her idle. the true miss independent.
i didn t know puritans were  modern  and npcs were  audiences .
i bet tripod lara can run like the wind ....
just on that note about andy signore  why is it always christianity that get s targeted  like if you hate one religion you clearly hate them all but christianity is the easy target.
i mean  someone told the a.i. to use curvy women as a basis... a.i. isn t just doing it out of the perviness of its heart.
you can be my lara croft any day
as long as she can have a british accent. sorry melanie.
it s weird  it s really fuckin weird that artists and designers paid actual money to come up with a design for lara can t strike a balance between strength and femininity  but a friggin machine that you d expect to think... you know... mechanically  gets it right.
we all know which specific audiences wanted to change lara crofts appearance in the first place.. lets be real guys and adress the elephant in the room
in shadow of the tomb raider there was a dlc skin that allowed people to play as the original looking tomb raider
the one thing i hate about  ai  being a digital artist myself  isn t actually the algorithm but the so-called  artists  who type in a prompt and a computer generated piece is spat out and they have the nerve to call it theirs without checking for blatant mistakes like 3 legs and janky hands with six fingers! if you re gonna use ai to create art at least learn how to fix the mistakes so the characters don t look deformed!. personally i d only use ai for backgrounds or use an image i created in 3d software as a base and then fix any problems in photoshop if need be!
she ain t no melonie  but she ll do in a bind.
i think they should take this opportunity to transition lara croft back to latina.think about it  they have already ruined lara croft with the reboot  so if we got a reboot that made her body type  face and personality og lara croft  but made her a mix of latina and caucasian  who would complain  we would have og lara croft back. start the rebooted series out with her first big adventure so that  as the series progressed  they could darken her up  from sun exposure  while keeping her personality and physical traits the same. by the time the later games came along  lara croft would be almost indistinguishable from the original latina prototype  while keeping her canonical british aristocrat backstory.honestly  if they just gave us og lara croft with the physical traits of the latina prototype  i would be more than hype about it  but i think the above-mentioned method would be even better  as it would essentially be working backwards to unify lara s depictions  skipping over the original reboot altogether  of course . it would be a bit jarring to have a british aristocrat be latina  so i think making her mixed and gradually be tanned from being out in the sun more would be the better approach.in any case  we deserve to have the feminine and fit bombshell lara croft with the reckless  take-no-crap-from-anyone attitude back. she remains an icon even after all these years of industry execs trying to make us forget she ever existed in hopes of appealing to a  modern audience.  we just want the real lara croft.
gina corano for the next lara !
imagine a.i. making the games we want in the future.
i ve read somewhere that the og lara croft indeed was supposed to be intimidating. and she was straight-up six feet tall.tr legend  anniversary and underworld  my favourite game  made her 5 8   but still with a huge  don t mess with me  vibe.then came the... non tomb-raiding reboot with  i hate tombs  beign an actual line in-game  and she s a generic 5 5  dumbass that keeps falling all the time. and what s with the bow and arrow
i m 31yo  ai lara makes me feel like a 13yo again  while actual modern lara makes me feel 130yo and gay...
glad to hear i m not the only one who isn t a fan of a.i.
17 05 that s an indian aunt next door  lara.
scott no for like reboot lara. give scott old lara. to abandon  hulk-speak   lara is one of my favorite characters  in my head-canon  i placed lara s mind in her doppelganger s body.
thats kinda funny honestly.  the woke crowd have transcended into full blown npc s to the point where their peak creativity involves taking character x and either making them fat  ugly  gay  or not white.  when an ai can come along and show more creativity and properly remake an established character better than people who are paid to do so  you know the entertainment industry has gotten bad.
no  angelina was the irl version of lara croft. now the irl version of lara croft is lanalux.https   www.youtube.com watch v wevxg5o6yyqand yes  she s already said she d like to play the part.
some of the problems with these characters come down to realism. i work on some job sites  and when the women show up dressed like sexy lara croft  i send them home. then  of course  the conversation comes down to me being a sexist male  but i have to remind them that having next to nothing on is improper ppe. when i see these fantasy stories with these half-naked women  particularly the battle armor  i think  she s not serious about this battle. she wants attention.
i would cast lauren cohan to play as lara croft
i love that i m not the only person suspicious of ai...they are trying to replace us....artist are just some of the first to be threatened in a broad spectrum
nothing against a beautiful strong and sexy lara croft! also because that s how the original character was designed like. and yeah  i never liked angelina jolie as lara.
11 05 made me think of tifa.  anyone else get that vibe
the psone character model yes  and they put a backhanded description of her too
@melonie mac go boom  yeah i still haven t beaten that game
the ai only paints based on what is given to them by the person they are told an objective or given images of the person or character.its still human ran.and at this point robots taking over was our ideal future we hoped for that instead it seems like we won t even have the stream engine for much longer.
@justin peace  they lived in high rises to make more room on the ground this is shown in one episode.also i like you basically say people would get depressed and bored with a lazy easy life they don t have to live.they can still do whatever they want.working is the only thing for people to do to keep them alive and if it is then whats the point of being a higher intelligent animal if our purpose is in just being worker drones rather than our own passions and intelligence understanding our own reality then why even be this smart  lets just be in the food chain like every other creature.
@chandller burse  they are right now  in this moment  in a lab able to grow  modify human embryos in artificial uterus
@justin peace  i don t see how you got that out of my comment dude lol.you need to get over yourself.
@justin peace  human cloning been a thing for years.many uses many benefits we don t know the idea here.
@chandller burse  abortion has been around for years  and they use z1 for medical research...doesn t mean it s not evil
@justin peace  what are you talking about abortion is desired by parents more than the government mothers mostly.
i hope they re not trying to discourage rule 34. cuz it s gonna happen.
i m starting to hate this ai thing it might kill some artists
i dont understand the fear of hot women. the characters can be both hot and strong. theres no rule saying they cant. i absolutely love to see women owning their femininity. it s powerful.
wow  ai art is better than most comic artist s work.
unpopular opinion but the pixar-looking lara looked good to me.
hopefully they don t go full butch look with the new character model. i wouldn t be surprised if amazon goes in that direction  just to spite us fans.
@17 00  did someone mistype fridge raider when they asked the ai tp come up with that
the next time somebody shames you for crushing on a fictional character  show them this video. you are not alone. loved the vid  mel.
i just have to ask  did you play any of the last three tomb raider games  specially rise of the tomb raider  lara is a straight up murderer  to me the last three games are the best tomb raider games that have been made.
i like this last remake  but is more because i grow up with this version  just play the 1 and 2 games . and think this lara is simply gorgeous. but a go watch why you don t like. may be i change my opinion  who knows
yeah  in the wrong hands  ai could do a world of damage. not a fan of it.
shrek lara  i kind of want that to exist. actual shrek wearing lara croft clothes and hair.
thank you for global night mode. good for you  for finding some value even in a rude comment. dark night mode needs be the standard. this blinding whiteness needs to just go away. especially as phones and monitors just seem to be getting brighter.
remember  most of the wokies that have to make female characters unattractive are themselves unattractive.  it s a pretty sad that their envy is making them feel better about themselves by tearing down an attractive fictional character.   i d bet good money that a lot of them that scream  women are not eye candy  secretly wish that they themselves were  eye candy. it s also pathetic that these game and comic companies insist on capitulating and pandering to a crowd of loud twit-wits that don t play games or read comics  rather than appeal to the very people to whom they wish to sell their products .
stick  em on a t-shirt  mel. i ll buy one!
ai artists know how to make beautiful art.
i agree that angelina jolie had the perfect look and charisma for it. too bad she thought otherwise. but that s actresses for you.
lol i love how ticked off you get about the new games. i love them personally it s a nice refreshing take on the character with a more realistic spin on things. and i grew up with the original type  i think the reboot trilogy lara is much prettier. but that s me.
i don t get why people talk shit about the new tomb raider games  they are all very good akd the character model is perfect.
she still will not punch a boulder xd
@chandller burse  doesn t mean it s not evil lol.
@justin peace  every action every motive may be layered with someone or some company that wants to use it for their own advantage yes.but thats always been humanity at this point.
@chandller burse  i don t have god complex. your the one getting mad lol
@justin peace  i never said you had a god complex
@justin peace  i was just making a basic reply and you went on about robots and human cloning who wouldn t be a little jarred if not irate lol.
@chandller burse  i was just making a basic rhetorical analogy not meant to be serious...i got a hammer to swing...you seem pretty cool and intelligent...i ve just been trolling the left here lately lol
@justin peace  okay better than most peoples intentions i guess have a good day.
it s not fear  but envy. the people behind the design choices only wish they were attractive and project that with their decisions in the aesthetics.
fiona is surely lara croft inspired. sharp tongue  athletic  strong will but still feminine.
@blackcroft666lp  yes  fiona is  but shrek though. he is one sexy ogre after all.
her point is laura is suppose to be hot not pretty  no reason to change a characters identity if the original is still popular  unless you want to change the narrative and why would they do that  woke..
i don t care as much about april being black as i am about her being overweight
is that a needler from halo i see in the bg  i ll sub just for that lol. also  thanks for the based content.
they can uglyfy lara all they want  just means she s no longer a relevant cultural icon  this has already come to pass because of their woke bs imo  and we now have a new gaming sex symbol in the form of 2b. all hail japan
lol  that  dude  who went after you is a demonstrable fool...his chat is members only and he straight up bans anybody in his chat who disagrees with him.  tldr whatever that vacant stare said  just keep in mind that he has proven incapable of defending anything that he says - even in his own chat  on his own channel.
the lara coft in the thumbnail is just her from tomb raider underworld with out a backpack not saying the new design is good but the ai didn t make that out of thin air
get on gab! but fair warning.  you re gonna see and hear things that you ll never see on reddit and much less likely to see on twitter
wow global dark mode i m gonna have to look into that
i for one welcome our new ai overlords.
a.i. is scary.  programmers worship their creation  turning it into an idol  giving the unseen enemies a new puppet.
the viewer that got mad because of dark mode needs to get out of their moms basement   look into sunlight for once in their life lmao
keep good artists and replace the woke ones with ai.
they re going to april o neil her for the next game for sure.
i m actually surprised they race swapped and made april ugly.  almost seems like they re saying  white girl   pretty  black girl   not .  i m sure that s not what they were going for  but since when have they shown any semblance of awareness in the past
i think rhonda mitra was a better irl model of lara croft.
the remake young lara looks like kirsten dunst. is that what the designers were going for
let s be real  we like to go to the movies and play video games that have attractive people.  women like to see athletic men with six packs without their shirts on  who are very masculine.  men like women who look like this 11 02 or even 14 00  who are very feminine.  it s our nature and it s what we want.  not for women to be more like men or for men to be less manly.  we want the sexy shit!plus  lara croft can react to situations like a normal human being  but what makes her different is that she lives for the adventure  because she s an adrenaline junkie.  this whole thing about wanting to make her more human in the newer games is nonsense  she s always been human.
the current april looks like the current velma.
that is how lara in the newer games should have looked but the wokies would have been mad and called it sexualizing. even my female character for the classic tomb raider inspired game i m working on looks better than remake lara.
tomb raider remake 1 had the perfect lara. they made her into this short and fat troll in tomb raider 2 and 3. i loved 1  but refused to buy or play 2 and 3 because of this  and i know i m not the only one.
making lara beautiful will instantly add to sales. how dense can they be
underworld wasn t that great of design but far better than the reboot.
sonnenrad obviously
exactly this
i refuse to play every female character which have been uglyified for the woke crowd  such aloy in the second game hzd
11 20 looks like it could be laura s daughter.
wow... ai will allow to create woke-free comics... great!
the lara croft we got was so generic and whiney. even though i absolutely loved those games. that image of her will always tarnish what could have been iconic.
did you ever consider beinga total packageto play the roleof laura cruz.. rogue jean greyapril o neilthe voice of any..
getting the vibe  or not  i can still tell thats april in the 50s looking pic.yea  its not her classic 80s and 90s cartoon look  but if someone showed me that and said it was april o neil id say  oh yeah  i can see that .there is an essence to a character and  if you do it right  its there even if the design is purposly dated to a different time period.the race swapped  frumpy looking  bag of sad that is this last rendition no  in no universe is that april.in a multiverse where there is an existance where a million chimps accidentally typed the script for hamlet  this is still never april.edit 100  agree with the lara croft picture.its the perfect counter-example of what im talking about.thats also a 50s pinup style design but in this case  completely opposite to april  it has lost the essence.its no longer lara  there is nothing in that picture that would make me believe thats her.
i always wonder who or what this modern audience even is.
0 15  isn t modern lara attractive to you  is she ugly and manly 10 20  the good about modern version is to become realistic  instead of cartoonish. they could however keep the latina vibe. 10 29 and 11 11 these seem to have indian heritage.13 50  i liked this 1. she could be latina or not  is strong and kind feminine too. the best so far.15 15  bond s girl. live with a mafia old man  but will has a night with 007.18 00  too idealistic  top model. it doesn t set the tr vibe. 20 20  too distracting. it s better she not be too gorgeous.
i agree with you on laura croft but what about male characters that have had their looks ruined for a western audience  example  geralt of rivia
i gotta admit 15 11 lara croft seem like the rhona mitra version
majority of these look way too masculine that it s actually not feminine. masculine doesn t always make it fierce  look at kate beckinsale from underworld a lot more slender than muscular yet she has a more fierce look that keeps the feminity.
there we go now that s a beautiful attractive laura croft thafs my laura croft
i don t have an inherent dislike of race swaps. the dislike comes from it only every happening one way. if the just rolled dice for every character and thats how they decided the race i wouldn t hate it so much  it still would be dumb and not great for story telling. sometimes you need a specific race and culture of ppl . the way they do it know is blatantly racist. they only do it for white characters and they disproportionately add in black characters. if you only knew about the us from tv and film you would think half the country is black  hardly any hispanics exist  and asians are an endangered species. their  representation  is way off and has nothing to do with real demographics and everything to do with them feeling like charity workers. also  i know the race swaps happen because of wokism and wokism as a whole is terrible ideology.all those combined makes me hate race swaps. not just the act itself.
so first it s gameplay  then it s not enough tombs. now it s looks  do classic stans look for anything to complain about in saying that  lara ai looks hella better than reboot  who looks far better than classic! but that s ai for you and i still like fan art better  classic or otherwise.just like how i like mel s content  classic or otherwise.
when the ai is out doing the woke folks.  haha
lara croft should have zero  racial ambiguity   because she is supposed to be a hard edged english aristocrat  that s the canon.
april is more mutant turtle shaped than the turtles.
on a side note  a.i is like taking a photo of the mona lisa and saying you did the art. i ve zero tolerance for a.i art and a.i artists.
what will really fix tomb raider at this point is a boycott of the new game.
13 48 lara crossfit  gym raider
what about geralt has been ruined  beyond the argument that cavill and hemsworth are too clean and chiseled while in the books geralt is scarred and even self described  ugly  its not that big of a deal.
@chandller burse  that s the thing they changed his character design in the witcher 3 when they got all that microsoft money and went public.
as far as i noticed it is not as extreme with the men though. well if you exvlude stuff like shaggy.
@snafu  he was fine in 3 he looks his best then.
classic stans have always been concerned about lara croft s looks  are you new
@melonie mac go boom  new to the fandom. i was introduced through tr2013 but i actually loved it so much i wanted to see what the older games were like. since most of the reboot fans i came across are still fans of classic too.for the record  i wanted to create some light hearted  satirical banter but your respectful response is why i still follow your channel.
and all those series.
when i think of  beautiful woman   i think of the lady i m talking to. curvy body  striking italian eyes  full-on feminine features  still got a uniquely feminine personality  no trace of  hollywoodized  make under in her beauty. once saw her without makeup  still 1000  better than what hollywood s done to women as of late. i can practically see her as a real-life version of lara.
i wish you could make the next tomb raider game.
the original lara won t work if you want to have a serious story and make her somewhat believable human being. i like the reboot vulnurable lara. if you want a sex symbol confident lara  you have to have some corny not serious story. like bayonetta - she is a great character  but can function only in this over the top story.
nobody is obsessed with her looks as you are. if a feminine body means having big breasts  wouldn t that make you a 15-year-old boy  lara was unrealistically big-breasted  or whatever her body type was  so now they re trying a more realistic approach. you know  it s what rebooting means. please turn off the faux news.also  i don t want to body shame you  it does seem like you do that hell of a lot for others.
alicia vikander is beautiful in that last tomb raider film
i want characters to be how they re supposed to be. april should be attractive  velma shouldn t. she just shouldn t look like mindy kaling.
i luv it!!
why... why is it that an ai can figure out laura and these characters so easily when these companies are incapable despite all the material in the world to provide them the road path  is this really why artists at large are so afraid of or have open animosity for ai  because the ai can fix their open mistakes or remove them from trying to gate keep content to make it woke  is it because ai now allows the public at large to produce the images they want for these characters and just blatantly bury these woke iterations under a mountain of what fans actually see as proper depictions of these characters
night or dark modes are bad for your eyes. it lowers the light and your eyes have to strain more to read the screen.
id say youre a an almost perfect balance between cute and sexy.you have that very girly cuteness to you  but you dont look childish.you still look very much like a woman.the same characteristic as jessica alba has.shes in her 40s and she still look and feels like a cutesy prom date but shes clearly a woman.i think its a combination between delicate features and a certain personality that gives off a very cute and nice youthful vibe no matter how old you get.i could be wrong  im just speculating here.
lara croft as the original game was young men who created a fun character for young men  it attracted women  because women love beauty and strength in each other.  a.i. art has promise of rapidly developing ideas  and fun for entertainment.  it is awesome.  lara croft is meant to be curvy.  her bullet boobs are also exciting  as they are part of the fantasy.
it s called artificial intelligence  but i think it s our intelligence that is artificial. would love links to these images.
so lara having a personality and showing emotion is bad  but her just being a onlyfans model is good
it s pretty sad that ai can do something in seconds that takes game developers years to do. it s even sadder when you realize that the ai did a way better job. i m not criticizing everyone who makes   designs video games but i think some of them need to find a new line of work if ai is doing their job better than they can.
is there a good website to view ai art
i get the redesigned lara look in the reboots because they were going for a more realistic take. but i always thought lara croft was a female james bond. james is  a male fantasy character. he capable  wears the finest suits  drives the nicest cars and gets the hottest women. as lara was strong  sexy  highly intelligent woman who overachieved her peers in a male dominated profession. imo
well wadya know  hal 9000 knows what people what to see in a female action star.
the anniversary trilogy was i think  the best games in the series. the graphics have aged decently  so the games still look nice  the game play  was highly polished  and this was before the reboot so we had the classic version of lara.
i don t think it s a bad design. honestly she looks super hot in all three games. i mean she s even hotter in the new design  but the actual design is much more practical. like..  i hate the woke shit too  but the lara croft thing is a reach imo
ai makes lara hot af!
this is the problem with the mainstream  people want unoriginal  realism
@melonie mac go boom  people want different things. i am just saying that the tone of the games would have to be very different with the  original lara   otherwise it would be ridiculous.nothing wrong with ridiculous games  there is room for both sirious and not sirious games. the developers went for  uncharted movie type  game with this  this wouldn t work with the original lara  who is a character that can hardly work today anymore  just like duke nukem is a character from different times
velma has more fans for her curves than daphne does dude do you not even understand the popularity of velmas design and i mean her original one.
velma is suppose to be the attractive nerd.
@galford s dog  she was curvy and many who find her attractive now grew up then too and liked her then as well.even johnny bravo preferred her over daphne.
@chandller burse  no  she wasn t. like what you like though. i m sure the johnny bravo thing was an ironic joke.
@galford s dog  attraction is subjective anyways since people here for some reason like the dollified megan fox over any natural woman.
@chandller burse  no  she s not. i m done with this conversation  it s pointless.
@galford s dog  its your opinion mate but she was curvy
realistic   you mean average. clasdic lara is realistic. just not your average woman. especially now with the obesity epidemic.
that trilogy looked good visually  but the gameplay was so babied down. playskool tomb raider for kids basically lol
the family drama and whiny behaviour were already annoying though. but the level design was nice.
i disagree. i prefer clothes on my game characters. just saying.  i ve loved the lara croft remake with her realistic clothing on. makes me feel like it could be me out there doing the things. i can t relate to a girl with boobs out to there and only scraps of clothing on.
just wait for tripple-momma-croft incoming
ai has more good taste than woke human artists. this should be humiliating for some.
im rootin for that ros  and lisa shirt  3
10 46 hahahahhaha she s got three legs haahaha the ai did it again
would it be too far-fetched to think that laura croft was created in the image of angelina jolie or is it just a complete coincidence that they look alike
current ai can t control itself  if can t do anything alone  it all is programmed  can t go alone and do stuff itself.
even ai shrek lara was hot lol
what is the song played at the end i ve never heard it before but absolutely dig it does anyone know it
what a youngwoman longingfor her father..
i have always said  a cute girl is a sexy girl who doesn t know she s sexy. so don t you worry mel  your plenty sexy lol
at 11 25   that s tifa not lara croft!
lara
11 06 looks like tifa from ffvii and laura did dragon ball z fusion.
how often does one come across an attractive woman who says another female is hot even  if that isn t even real
lara should have muscles...then she can show of her skin as much as she wants  because has what to show!
that guy is just mad he can t date you lol
they are purposefully making characters ugly and trying to make it pass by saying  girl next door .  that s a huge lie.  the  girl next door  could easily be a bombshell beauty.  it should not be used as a descriptor.
ai got it right
thats why i played the game ...wait  puzzles good too.
lara croft isn t supposed to be relatable
@melonie mac go boom  you can t reason with those people. melonie!
never played the classics. she wears clothes. tanktop and shorts in tge first. in the second also diving duit and a jacket. in the third even long trousers in some levels.she is a woman. she has different outfits. she herself just decides what to wear. not the weather.but some people can t handle pretty and confident women i guess.
1995 and angelina  hmm was she already a thing at that time
combine them. that just makes them both even better.
fat lara looks like uncharted s old mod of  donut drake
thats a race swap i can get behind!   i know i m awful i repudiate myself.
14 09 ai lara croft is so hot  i wish that was how she looked in the new games
some of these ai art look off which shows this tech still has a number of hiccups and challenges to go through.
11 45 that s disturbing as f   !
i m old enough to remember when rooney mara apologized for  white washing  tiger lily in that peter pan movie like 10 years ago. wokeness is a cancer
speaking as a guy  that 1st laura pix is not   girl next door  cute  more clerk at a conveni store.
honestly i like new look of  lara croft except for shrek lara croft  and tha doll looking one really don t like it. but love it an amazing video.  more pls lol
can we get an ai to fix you
nail on the head!!also puppy! 19 02
i just got a really good ai lara croft
15 42my boyfriend lost conciousness when this pic came up xd

glam lara looks like cindy crawford!
@16 29 lara kraft
mediterranean  that s what i veiw lara croft as. part italian  greek  turkish...something.

16 28 lara croft in frig raider
she didn t have any other nationally in her bloodline she came from english aristocrats ffs  she obviously get a tan when she s in hot countries
google image searched  lara croft ai art
thanks  i was using duck duck go
found it
19 04 this is ps1 mama lara croft
gina carano would make a great lara  imo
the second one  the anime one  lara looks native american.
oh  dear. this has to have caused much shrieking.
dang awesome
14 25 - this one reminds me of jessica lucas.
a.i.  like pepperidge farms  remembers....
wait you have no ad-block or script blocker
megan fox would be perfect for lara s face model
im cool with the ai lara who looks like druuna or supermodel amazon gal. wow. she s supposed to be larger than life. and that is affirming for all women
very nice!
the bigger lara pics reminded me of abby from last of us 2
15 55 is the one
me  a heterosexualelton john  a homosexual melonie  a larasexual
you suppose to be like   fuck run that chick is coming with guns run!
the middle april o neil art resembles megan fox  which is fine because i liked the 2014 tmnt movie. didn t care for the sequel  out of the shadows  though.
i think michelle rodriguez would have made a great lara croft years ago.
girl next door   more like mom next door
16 35 is pantry raider.
@10 30 that s not a third leg  that s trans_lara.
i mean tifas design is asian.
rofl
shrek lara!!
not modern audiences but the 1  audience.
i d be okay with a blue-eyed lara croft if she looked like @lanalux!!
lara croft from the incredible s lol @11 52
shriek lara ! i m done.
yessss cross eyed lara 3 leg at 10 39
thankyou for dark mode!...and hot laura!
that dark skin lara croft reminds me of sheva alomar from re5
that one image you liked looked a little too megan fox for me  or at least how she used to look i guess  don t know what she looks like now.
she s up here saying that the real life model for the present day lara isn t pretty  attractive or womanly.. that s kinda toxic
the new april o neal looks more like sonic the hedgehog than a woman.
what do you think of the artworks of kameliya minkova
i like green eyes. green eyes are rare in real life. i have green eyes but in darker light you mistake them for brown.
a.i   skynet
your missing the fact that survivor trilogy lara is based on camilla not the original model
personally melonie i am more attracted to the reboot lara croft.but i will admit the ai is what she should bethe reboot lara is pretty but she should be her own character not lara  maybe a cousin at least but not the lara croft.
this video is not on rumble yet. darn.
is that bettie page   lol
yo that ai lara craft looks bass
they made nebula a dude in the new guardians of the galaxy.   nuff said.
you re missing literally everything about the character of that is what you boil it down to lol. original lara croft was not modeled off of any person apart from some inspiration  and reboot lara croft wasn t even modeled after camilla luddington lol!  they hired a separate model.they made lara croft look different than she was created to be on purpose
16 32 - bertha croft
someone used vergina from son of the forest. i though i seen that face before.
scares me too.. and woke lara croft. yikes. imagine if she was your boss or someone you have to work with haha
lara croft is female dante  she even does the dual wield
now that s more like it.
11 50 looks  terrible  lol
i mean.... some of the sfms of lara are....
you could be lara croft if do more sport
14 45 halle berry croft!
looking as though they re stressing more on the  boyish looks in tomboy with this pic.
christ  chonky croft look like she ate lara.
i had nothign wrong with the remake lara croft. if you didnt like her outfit you can always mod ur game to give her a crop top vneck
no one going to call out the frist one having three legs hahahahahaha
most women hate it if a girl looks better than them. think about the rage they feel when a bunch of 1 and 0s look better than them
11 24 tifa from ffvii
if jolene blalock from enterprise was a better actress she could ve been laura croft. she s got the goods.
they didnt go with the source material with galadrial
17 14 masculine lara
i prefer a hot and smart lara croft over the new lara croft
dante is the male lara croft  she was first. get it right
the fight scenes could be better
just her  personality   behaviour  design  backstory...
still superior to the reboot. she just kicks your but with three legs.
that s not body positivity lara though...coming to a gaming screen near you in 2026 haha....
you become lara croft
just a reminder to drink water. stay safe. take care. have fun.
the one where she looks over weight is her after she retired  had 6 children and ate one too many happy meals because her children couldn t finish them. then she had to go and rescue her twin daughters who are lost in the congo.
lara cruz looks like thata dark hairedfaye dunaway
reboot laura at 10 39 had 3 legs lol
gladriel. you put sean beans face on it it and its game of thrones.
16 35 don t give them ideias.
ai is secretly programmed based.
i like reboot lara  13   rise  but.....
that looks likejean greyor a roguesomeone from the officeminus the hair underthe nose and chin
now do alloy from the second horizon
its not womanly anymore  its woe manly.
my wow kul tiran shaman looks like that  lol
by 2024  all women in western media will be portrayed by p1 mokujin.
reboot lara looks so reypy and the 1st game do made her like that.abby lara looks curse ld lmao
what do you mean  wildeer already did that
can the ai bot write   develop the next game tbh i see these reboot games with as i call  clara loft  like i did with the sappy boring bond film s with daniel craig  all spectacle   0 character.
i know i m reaching  but gal gal gadot laura croft.
she has three legs in that first one
they re gonna say ai is sexist and misogynistic
melanie  you need to install the  return youtube dislike  extension so that we can see the dislikes on videos that you are looking at in your videos.
16 00 damn !
yo the tank top lara craft is just right
demonic element  wtf
dude  april o neil in the original animated series had bigger bobs
i don t like lara having all those muscles
i guess the story goes  lara s father married a amazon woman.  mix english and laten american. what genetics would she have
kwasade for the algorithm.
why does lara have 3 legs
all fun and games till a.i starts killing all the john conners around the world
i don t need sexy... i just want hot! xdthe character is supposed to be a blueblooded  british  bombshell! am i wrong  even the actress they chose for her was more attractive than they made her cgi self. why tone that down  mocap suits did all the work already....
11 05 tifa croft
watching the video --  lara croft is sexist  my response -- provides a intelligent background prelude to this video if you are new to the tr
alexzedra  --- real life lara croft.. she is in call of duty.. and has an awesome channel... cast her immediately...
14 06 gorgeous  but ah  doesn t it almost exactly like jolene blalock
no dont you understand we need our reality in our fantasy  lol
lara croft should have a body like wonder woman nuff said.  not gal gadot  actual wonder woman from the comics. just feminine but stacked.
16 33 - ahhh....the plus size model.
now that s a hot lara croft !!!
my pc is dark mode. it s much better on the eyes.
16 50reminds me of the fat photoshopped angel of darkness lara and final fantasy x-2 yuna that were featured in gaming magazines years ago.
croft should at least look like a fitness model. not a softy.
i dunno.  i never had a problem with the current gen lara.  thought she was a cute as hell.  and honestly   that first picture of the original yomb raider looks like a plastic surgeon nightmare imo.  just keeping it .
omg i never realised the new lara croft was so bland. i thought she looked great in the first game. this makes me sad now
i don t want people to take a.i. art seriously accepted because it steals others people art pretends it s did all the work.
ai lara most of them we re good and all but you are very beautiful too
push a boulder  or carry 2....
the version @ 16 29 looks like she could have been a version of the female dwarf that was tossed into that crap rings of power.
16 30shrlara croft...enlarga croft...
ai look like wankanda lara.
slow day  i see.
melonie could be lara
they should do the same to the resident evil characters now that crapcom has gone woke
and ai creates these from scatch but why we can search these images and its diffrent character lol. yes it google and change image
demonic really are we still talking about this in 2023  lol
i m patiently waiting for the race-swap feature length version of tarzan... let s see disney do that pandering bullshit!
dem abs
tinkerbell-of-color is  beautiful ... but morfydd clark is just  pretty  thank god i don t drink kool-aide  i guess.
tomb  lol
lara croft isn t supposed to be cute  she is supposed to be an unattainable bombshell
@melonie mac go boom  i guess if you are into the potato chip lip kardashian look..  of all the iterations of lara  personally   i found the current the most attractive.  to each his own.
15 55 hot damn!
agree.  mel u r cute!  the 2 versions near end in mature w  more make up  indeed too feminine  maybe don t need the curly hair.
number 5 and number 7 are legit
make-under  lol
big bertha alpine mama laura said knock u out
nah  so much worse! ai breaks lara croft even further.
based ai
yeah nowaday lara lroft must not look too feminine and keep a teenager body
too me lara has always been big lips  big chest  toned waist and legs. and built like a fitness trainer woman. a white girl with a tan  she is british after all.
you must not know that april o neil is originally afro latina. the people behind the cartoon show forced the creator to make her white. so technically you should be upset that they race swap her .
9 47 catherine keener
11 05 tifa croft
jolie is the same exact thing. irony.
a.i. is really good at drawing women  but it really seems to have something against opening the pod bay doors.  and what s this  there is another system  business
megan fox was a great april.
16 30 will not make it to the next cliff  rip a vine or break a ledge
here s my thing about race-swapping.  i m writing a screenplay about the life of martin luther king  jr.  i m hoping to produce it as a movie and i want to get george clooney to play mlk.  see what i did there
i think youtube is unsubbing people from your channel. i have had to re-subbscribe to your channel 2 time as of now
16 48 don t you dare disrespect shrek!!!
you sure that didn t come from rule 34 instead
putting this in the  ai could save us  column.
oh wow that sucks d
lol one of the lara craft had three legs
please ai fix american wokies now!
the a.i. is fixing what what broken
it isn t obvious that the  modern  audience want it that s why they all flop
race swapping you should check out what wotc is doing to lotr.
second one is lara tifa croft. i don t mind. all a i. even pixar are superior to the so called reboot.
algorithm bump
what do you think of orchid from ki
i never understand why sexy women should be bad. sexy women are a godsend. and lara should be number one.
dark hairedbarbara streisand
16 34 lol my thoughts exactly  if the progressives could get their way.
i don t know those pics don t really do it for me either.
its funny how badass women in the entertainment media are created by men.  but no  shes carries guns or shes too sexy!
ai knows what the people want. lmao
pixar one is the best
it s called a tan.
maybe he wasn t  spreading misinformation ... maybe he was just wrong
lara croft
see! everyone believes lara should look hot! it s just the few people you shouldn t be pleasing. remeber! the larger audience counts the most! the larger vote counts too  so how come it ain t showin here.
where are the pixels
why did she have three legs in that picture
over-confident ...  hyper-confident ... that s what you call an arrogant woman in 2023  i guess.
too many woke devs in the industry. ruining our games for ppl who most likely dont play them.
i m waiting to see the many many fingers before i start this video
i subbed in 30 seconds after she went on her rant about making women characters ugly!
its not ai.  its just a sophisticated program  there s no intelligence there  at least no more than a pocket calculator.
a gina caranodownsized version
man  that new.... ai filter ...is a gangstano holds barred. you may tink yer hawt.....the filter says....naught
race swaps that chad wouldn t hunt lol don t cancel me please
oh my!
being  spanish is  white  she could easily have a british father who was an explorer and spanish mother he met somewhere. or vice versa. they don t need to race swap to make her latin.
you should ve seen what they did to aloy in horizon forbidden west. she looks like a man now.
i think this ai program could do a better job then disney
less is best....change my mind
when are we going to stop with the ai nonsense
even a.i. knows what lara croft is supposed to look like.
17 05 looks like sarah huckabee sanders
guy-lad-rial
mmmm pixar lara lol
hmm... ai art... hmm
nooo  for me angelina jolie played a good lara croft and looked good as croft. but when you say that lara croft looks curvy and scary looking  i imagine a woman like jolene blalock in the role! and another thing  people should know that there are some latinos from europe or south america  that are really white  they could be latinos that look like white people. i have a lot of friends in argentina and spain and some of them  look like white people. so yeah  we could see lara croft as a latino that looks white. there is no problem with that.
i don t think angelina was good as lara croft  she was simply not athletical enough for that role!alicia vikander was much better and her role was also written much better and the picture at 13 54 pritty accurate shows her.
ai means the same as ncp
i wish lara inspired by michael turner s comics. but i dont think this lara will ever return they will do again some crap. i dont consider last games as tomb raider and not becouse of cinematic experience there were some tomb raider elements acrobatics weren t overdone like in legend and all that shi  was cool. what wasnt cool.was lara look and her character . story drama .... i donr know why from legend crystals step by step wanting to do lara totally different first braid than outfits than her sunglasses than her body than character all is just wrong.
who that look likekerry washington..
ai is basedwhen did society decide to hate women  an honest question.
started off attractive now doesn t look like her anymore
wtf are these people thinking!
pixar lara is just...no.
dammmmm sheeee bad
the original lara croft was a bombshell. she was not masculine.
i feel that some of that art is a little too tifa. lara is distinctively not tifa. my 2 cents.
algorithm
do we ever hear about overweight men complain about jacked super heroes   no we dont lol
13 48 looks latina and laura is white so i say no!
lara croft was supposed to be a female opposit to james bond. man want to be him women what to be with him.   stay with lara just opposite    women want to be her   man want to be with her.
jennifer connelly..
rhona mitra
stop propping up ai art
will only except thick laura. forever   always. no muscle whatsoever.
that you a.i
i can t look at angelina jolie without seeing jon voight.  i m sorry.  but  no.
fun fact  don t be a snowflake
the current lara croft is so ugly she could scare flies off a manure truck
next lara will probably be some black trans potato in a wheelchair doing everything better than their trained counterparts..
it seems to me that all this woke-ism shite is trying androgynise every character  the hyper masculine muscle bound hunks and the hyper feminine curvaceous ladies are getting toned down or just completely changed
give lara her curves and lips back. the new lara look is bland and boring. you show anyone new lara they won t know it s her because she doesn t stand out as a character.
wow...i was fully ready to defend against some crazy conservative nonsense but actually i agree with you once you explained yourself. take note conservative women.
lara is british. doesn t need racial ambiguity.
this modern audience s crap is just an excuse to push their narrative.  some people might like it but the vast majority of people don t.
our most beloved caracter     dont you mean mens most beloved caracter.... how many years have women been outraged by the fact men love lara croft    seriously society has taken everything from men now they want our fictional game caracters too...lara croft was made my a man for men seriously nothing is sacred these days....
i liked lara croft from the 2013 game. she hit right in the middle beautiful but strong and intelligent.
sorry laura cruz..
what even worse they retcon to put a slam on christians in the show  who knew rain wilson would be standing up for christianity  such a rarity
imho jolie was a not a good lara  visually passable  but otherwise no.
uwu
modern audiences
race swap and gender swap is just stupid in my opinion
same
nah thanks. but at least they dared to gsve her a pretty face and eyes. but they took that away  too.
wow ! ur a blackpink fan  awesome shirt.  attractive sexy feminine kpop idols.. u wont see that in western celebrities..
i actually liked reboot lara in 2013  rise took me awhile to like  but shadow is so ugly
in the first tomb raider game your doing backflips with double pistols over spike pits.  the new games just look so bland and boring.
if you don t think the new lara croft is physically attractive  that s on you.
ai removes some of lora croft clotheslook ai fixed lora croft!
hot
i never liked jolie as lara...at all
this is content
if we re not carful. it ll be face tats lip ring shrek. gender dysphoria laura haha.
vicky guerrero..
never play god
i always thought lara croft was caucasian and indian mixed  especially with the thick british accent.
yeah i saw angry joe come after melonie  she said some guy she didn t know hahaha we all know who joe is  that being said i unsubb him a long time ago  he has horrible takes and he has become lazy with his reviews he doesn t complete games and complains about things that aren t in the game that are  he copied other youtubers reviews and adds it to his instead of playing the game himself. i use to really love his content but he s just cringe now  i play all the games for free and he gets paid to play them and cant even beat them  it s crazy.
rhona mitra is irl lara  not angie fugly
tinkerblackno thanks.
what does wasp mean
hamster craft
11 15tifa lara croft.  lol14 54  disagree. i get trans lara croft vibes from that.  facial structure and about 20  too muscular.
first video i m watching here looking at the video title list. i have questions is this like nerd culture for fascist  are there any videos not complaining about something
at least a.i. didn t make her out to be latina even though she is swedish and west african though..... neneh cherry . a.i. art is ass. no real artist should ever want to use it. defeats the whole purpose of creating art.
no
did you miss the far superior face and body  why so focused on clothes
wasp waist   a small waistline that resembles the shape of a wasp  the bug
@melonie mac go boom  oh ok thanks for the feedback  and great vidoe!
maybe the face but the body is just shredded.
if youre worried about demonic influence... maybe check into the music youre listening to... really
your hot the new tinker bell is not. that is just my not racist opinion.  playing the 1st game at 14 years old on my ps1. that t tex fight was fucking hard. her look now should be a mystique female almost but slightly tan with a natural beauty.
such a sexist ai  reeeeeeeeeeee!
not really  a lot of these look painful and hard to wear. especially the one in the thumbnail. she s really exposed to a lot of environmental threats  like the weather and insects parasites.
lol imagine saying ai is  demonic  what a cringequeen. first time i disagree with you
not better the white ary version is better but i do agree too conservative.
blackpink
laura croft is a tanned  white woman. always has been. i don t get why people forget that white people tan. especially if they re of mediterranean ethnicity...
kind of mannish in that thumbnail.
i prefer lara to not have tattoos  says the woman with the massive lara tattoo lol! the ai versions make crystal lara look like a budget cosplayer. the last few versions look a bit like kate beckinsale
i left my comment on another platform
i also think a.i. is sus
i enjoyed the last trilogy. i didn t think she wasn t feminine.
no. the actress playing tinkerbell-of-color is not beautiful. no.
not realistic
splinter cell reboot is going to be for  modern audiences .i bet that they will replace sam fisher with an overweight lesbian black trans woman.
what all these woke activists fail to understand is despite the west s relative diverse populations compared to far more homogenous nations  we are still majority white countries  with majority white histories and cultures  which naturally feature majority white historical people and fictional characters because it is told from a majority white experience perspective of the world  and there is nothing wrong with that. that is no different than any nation who will be dominated my their nations natural populations. it should come as no surprise that majority white nation s culture is heavily white dominated. that doesn t mean non-white minority groups should be marginalised or treated less than  but we should not be replacing our cultural figures for diverse version in order to be more  inclusive . if we really want to be more inclusive of others  then lets start telling stories and learning about other cultures  including their myths  stories and characters. they can live along side white culture  really no need to replace it. its an over correction that will ultimately backfire.
ok you got me there
damn  what does she listen to  teletubbies soundtrack  that does sound scary.
@melonie mac go boom  lol melanie. great response. respect on that  but seriously.. think on it. it s the no 1 way they get through to us. just sayin
@giggling stoner  nah. she knows what i m talking about and is an awesome enough person to get it. most people just get defensive. she just earned a lot of respect from me for that.
lara croft never cared though. it is lara croft. not whiny b tch.
if satan is the  god  of this world then isnt everything demonic
my issue why  white women trying  there dark  skin in the characters try to look like native american women or mexican women
you seem to have a lot of problems with the way women look that don t effect you in any way
they dont forget  they just want all iconic white characters race-swapped
it s not about her  she doesn t need to see herself represent ed and tattoos are not true to the character
i dunno why that is confusing. i don t want a character changed to be like me lol
my bad  i ve caused some misunderstanding! i was just teasing  since the moment had a bit of irony to it hahaha..i realised we are all a bit on edge  given some of the recent events here. but as a weirdo  i bear no ill will  i promise !
@coffee dude
honestly pretty much  a crap ton of mainstream stuff is demonic influenced  probably more than we know
some white women do tan naturally you know . my brother got the native american in the family so he tans but i got the ginger.
same can be said about you
@zero todona  how though  how
ruining franchises does effect everyone though.
sorry  but as a male feminist i disagree.
