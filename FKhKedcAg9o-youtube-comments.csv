i am with the egyptian lawyer. i am sooooo fricking tired of this bs!
cleopatra  is greek for  father s glory   and her full name  cleopatra thea philopator  means  the goddess cleopatra  the beloved of her father.  everything in the greek language has an explanation and meaning! she was the third daughter of the king ptolemy xii auletes  probably born to her father s sister  making her third in line to rule after her two other sisters died. cleopatra was a direct descendant of alexander s general  ptolemy i soter  son of arsinoe and lacus  both of macedon. a greek by language and culture  cleopatra is reputed to have been the first member of her family in their 300-year reign in egypt to learn the egyptian language. respect to both greek and egyptian history!!!!
this reminds me of when u.s. critics demanded that japanese anime creators stop offending them. their demands were rejected.  wokeism is a western creation that the rest of the world rejects.
well done to the egyptian lawyer! there are some people who haven t lost their sense of reason and put their professional skills to set things right! meanwhile  the greek ministry of culture is sleeping!
i totally support their lawsuit. tired of those fools rewriting history with impunity.
i m half masri  egyptian  from my mother side  and trust me when i say when it comes to heritage  egyptians don t mess around. the lawyer is well in his right to pursue legal action against netflix.
how many times have i ever said this for years now. they re not  representing  they re trying to compensate. so much for fighting against  colonialism  by becoming colonizers themselves.
the egyptians do not play when it comes to people trying to change their history in any way. they get big mad  especially when media try to make their country s most famous figures appear like middle and southern african s instead of mediterranean arab.
it s hilarious that jada didn t do any research about cleopatra. it s been common knowledge for a long time that  she was greek macedonian. just because egypt is apart of africa  doesn t mean everyone was black. if jada wants to promote african queens  i bet if she researched a little bit  she could find a lot of them.
hi i am egyptian  and i am finally glad that people standing up to support us  afrocentric people gone wild and trying to claim the ancient egyptian history  they say modern egyptians are invaders and black people were the true egyptians  keep in mind i am also coptic one of the oldest races in egypt  they used our language to decode the ancient egyptian civilization  ancient egyptians were reddish brown  pale to the north and get darker to the south
cleopatra was greek. this is very important in historical context. the roman and greek empires viewed egypt quite differently due to this fact. if cleopatra was black or middle eastern  the way rome or greece would interact with egypt would be quite different.
they can t call it a documentary when they are intentionally adding false information.
i have no respect for netflix or any other woke company. it s anyways great to see their virtue signaling backfire.
channel 5 in the uk race-swapped the historical figure queen anne for a black actress in their production  anne boleyn . there was little backlash  despite the historical inaccuracy and the cultural appropriation  because any or all objections were labelled  waayyysisst . for those unfamiliar with anne boleyn  she was the white second wife of king henry viii of england and was a key figure in the english reformation.
in this documentary  the actual story of cleopatra has been adapted for a modern audience. i bet she ll also be depicted as a warrior queen who can defeat any man in battle.
as someone of greek and italian ethnicity  i get exactly where this egyptian lawyer is coming from. my people rarely get good representation in media. and that includes some benny hill in a bowl cut playing a roman emperor.
i m looking forward to the scene where marc anthony slaps octavian and tells him to  keep my wife s name out your mouth.
it s always a pleasure to see you  melonie! you seem to be giving off more positive vibes than in recent past. netflix keeps giving reasons to reconsider whether to keep it or not. i hope lawyer suing them makes netflix squirm. i m fairly certain  that  with all the nonsense jada has pulled  i probably wouldn t watch it even if it was historically accurate. you are beautiful  melonie   and courageous. thank you for all that you do. may god continue to bless you and keep you safe and well.
i m kinda surprised that a greek didn t sue them as well since queen clepatra was a greek woman
what this lawsuit shows is that other people are tired of black actors and actresses appropriating characters and roles that were not originally written that way.  think of the black female viking queen from that netflix series  super cringe but most people are afraid to say something.don t be afraid to stand up for common sense and logic!
i m glad someone is standing up to this stuff
no one in egypt right now shares any blood line or dna history to anyone living in egypt back then so they dont have any right to feel angry about something that has nothing to do with them. lastly older pharaohs remains have already been tested to have black ancestry.  cleopathra sister has also been tested to have black ancestry.  you would think this would be a coming together moments of the black history in the region but it s sadly bigotry that always seems to win out.
what you don t like  we wuz kangz
lol ancient egypt was founded by black people  africans. ptolemy only came to egypt in the dying days. arabs currently days egyptians only conquered egypt in 625 ad  so cry more please.
@mahatma1989  lolo  no it wasn t. and that s entirely irrelevant  considering alexander the great invaded the country and installed his general as it s leader way before the arabs showed up. lol.
@mahatma1989  north-africa was sparsely inhabited  by bedouins  one of the very few to actually build something was the barbary states  and guess what the needed the ships for  massive slave trading  black and white slaves. roman empire was the first to make large cities and put it on the map using engineering  goths and visigoths and vandals also made empires there  alle uitu piggu.egyptians were never black. look at any copt not killed yet. lovely arabs.
@jame gumb  actually the original peoples of the area later called egypt were in fact  black . which isn t a direct term in this case but is being used as an umbrella term to explain skin tone. not genealogical origin. obviously as various peoples went through their offspring didn t look like their ancestors. the original people were  black   egyptians weren t at this point in time  and cleo wasn t egyptian or black. his tory is fun and easily confusing
@jame gumb  we don t really know what the old kingdom egyptians that built the giza  sphinx  and all the ridiculously impressive stuff looked like. they were as much ancient to romans and greeks as cleopatra to us. though given that skin color is defined by climate they were likely more brown than black.
@mahatma1989  no it wasn t. it was founded by north africans. people who resemble middle eastern people.  they were not sub saharan african.  that would be the nubian empire.  in fact modern egyptians have more sub-saharan dna than ancient egyptians did.
@vivian woods  genetically they were not black and physically they would have actually resembled native americans or middle eastern people. in fact modern egyptians have more sub-saharan dna than ancient egyptians did.
@mike carson  you were kangs and shat
make america great again   make entertainment great again
@mike carson  its been said time and time again cleopatra is greek  with sources saying she has traces of iranian heritage not african
i m a cypriot and my grandfather did his apprenticeship in cairo.
@mike carson  bs! she was greek so stop with the lies. subsierran africans we re not egyptian. nobody from ancient rome ever recorded her being black when she followed caesar there. no ancient historian claimed she was black.
@paul bentley  exactly egyptian were never black but they can tan so they are white as for cloepathra she greek. nextfix   better get it right they could of got some one closer to her skin like elizabeth taylor  who was perfect.
same
@mike carson  you have no idea what you are talking about.
@mahatma1989        !!!!!!
@mike carson  actually no  genetics tests on ancient mummies show modern egyptians have more links to southern africa than the ancient ones did. besides  the greeks invaded the country hundreds of years before the roman empire did  and cleopatra is descended from them. rewriting history to be the way you want isnt going to work.
@mike carson  people who spent a lot of time researching egypt and agree celo was greek she was not a black woman. you are claiming the opposite but you don t have proof or evidence other than making claims.
@mahatma1989  that s not true ancient egyptians were not black
@mike carson  so your for cultural appropriation. okay  got it.
@sasa gaming  coward
islamic reasons for a lawsuit  lol are you for real
you should be way more angy at the underlying reason they do it.
@mike carson  exactly! how can arab egyptians be so mad about the subject    how come none of these blogs or news outlets never ask egyptians  who do consider themselves black  their opinion on the subject
@they said i m asian  it s been said time   time again by whom ! lolz cleopatra is egyptian not greek. she was born in egypt maybe almost a century after her great great great grand father ptalomy was given egypt by alexander. this woman you call greek wasn t even considered greek to the actual greeks  so stop it. if she is 100  greek than obama is 100  irish  lolz. yes the woman had some greek blood running through her veins  but the only people who have  called her  greek   to make he white  through out the recent decades are the same ones who have you thinking hannibal was white or that queen of sheba was a pail  skinned woman etc etc. i want to know why these arab egyptians aren t mad at this woman calling the last documented egyptian pharaoh greek  you are all ok with giving here a different 100  nationality  but get freaked out when associating her with  an actual blood line to her native land. that fits the egyptology way so well  afraid of the politically made construct  black  not the political construct  white  but  black . in the last 100 years you ve some how made ancient kemetic people  other  some how are more related to whites than they are to  what you ve tagged as the   sub saharan   the real africa    hahaha! egyptology was created by white supremest to radically dissect egypt  kemet  from africa   over a few decades it s been taken over by arabs to continue that legacy.
@zenster  i like that. hahaha!
@talynstarburst  standing up to what
@bon bon  to sjws like you
@talynstarburst  i have know idea of what you are talking about. but i wish you well in your delusions
@mike carson how exactly did they determine that the remains were her sisters   you don t like it tell it to the egyptians.  only americans think their opinion not only matters but is correct.  also it isn t your fight not that you can scrap a lick.
@bon bon  if you want to talk about delusions  then you should know the difference between  no  and  know
@bon bon  besides  anyone can look at your history and tell that you are only here to validate your hurt feelings. so continue to make up a narrative about people you do not know to feel better about your life
tuesday april 25th 2023  1645hrscw 4days ago i am with the egyptian lawyer. l am soo000 fricking tired of this bs!  me too.i m soooo tired of arab egyptians culturally appropriating the real black african egyptians identity.
@mohamed adel  mohamed adel 1 day ago @mahatma1989that s not trueancient egyptians were not black  well present day egyptologists say otherwise. oh...and the original north africans were black also!!!look at the cave paintings in algeria. all of them...black african!!!
@talynstarburst  hahaha! what hurt feelings  spreading knowledge is having hurt feelings now  you say the sky is green   i correct you   say it s actually blue    because of this i have hurt feelings. you make no sense at all. lolz
@talynstarburst  no that s called texting in the wrong word. lolz delusional is when a person thinks something is orange when it s clearly purple. you feel me.
@bon bon  you are here to preach because you have hurt feelings. and you cannot speak on knowledge when you cant tell the difference between no and know
@bon bon  snowflakes are fun to watch though  you all are the same
@talynstarburst  actually i m here just like most people. to entertain myself. giving you truth while i m doing it is actually enjoyable.
@bon bon  you are just mad that i called you out before you can even get started here. take the l and preach to someone who cares
@bon bon  so you basically proved my point when i said you are here to create a narrative and preach to feel better about yourself.. that is the enjoyment you are getting
@bon bon  and not to mention.. that you simply just want attention here. it is really sad that out of all the things that you can do for enjoyment  you chose this as your outlet
@weaver quest  actually genetic studies say they would have likely looked fairly similar to native americans. or like a cross between native americans and middle eastern people.
@wonko the sane  i m not talking about modern eqyptians   so not sure why you d bring that up. also when you say  they  are you referring to the same group that i am talking about  the peoples that inhabited that land before it s name was changed to egypt  before various groups of people migrated through the area and procreated  because yes  genetically they were  black  as in people of melanated skin tone typically on the darker side of that scale. like someone saying the descend from vikings as compared to claiming they are currently a viking. a group that has mixed and changed geographical location over time. which has part in the blood of multiple countries and continents. right  gotta be specific when talking about genealogy and it s importance in history.
@vivian woods  i am talking about the people who founded the egyptian empire.  they were north african a different genetic group than sub-saharan african  what people know as  black  people   .  dna studies suggest their skin tone would have most likely resembled modern native americans though they aren t really related. just like aboriginal australians and sub-saharan people have a similar skin tone though they are about as genetically far apart as you can get.  the people you are thinking of would have been the people to found the nubian empire.
@wonko the sane  no  because you are assuming what i mean by the term  black . even as i ve explained who i m talking about. technically each group you listed is considered  black  as most people in the modern day use it to describe anyone person that is dark in completion. which you should also be aware that various native american tribes have openly talked about being  black  before colonization and migration from various other peoples. the aboriginals in this way are also considered to be a  black people .  while many people will say  everyone  originated from africa  they will still overlook how migration  and mixing of bloodlines  and changes overtime shaped the world.      essentially you re playing colorism. you re separating by shades and degrees of  black . it s all  black  genetically speaking. geneticists have broken it down to 3-4 originating bloodlines.  human    humanoid neanderthal   an unknown.  many have stated that those closest to the original  human  line are  black people    not visually but genetically. so that would include bipoc people who in all visual terms appear  white  .       the conversation is a confusion of genetics which are unseen to the naked eye and appearance which is all we see.     also as an aside are you suggesting that there aren t any modern day  black  who are descendants of northern africans  because i severely hope not.
@vivian woods  no native americans were not  black . they are largely descended from the same ethnic group as mongolians. btw east asian people are the only group that is mixed with disnovian dna.   most aboriginal people were not  black . that is a misconception based on  often intentional  mistranslations of ancient languages.  and north african people might have had some sub saharan dna much like many modern humans have some neanderthal dna but it dosent make them neanderthals.  and hominids are descended from africa the actual case for humans ethnic groups is a bit more sketchy. for example most european dna is mixed with neanderthal dna and east asian dna has a bit of disnovian dna and we know very little about disnovians. he k we have never even found a complete skeleton for one and the only place they have been found is in asia.  then again there have been hominid specie s that have only need found on a single island.  and we don t know what color the first humans were we only know they appeared in africa.  dark skin is an adaptation to living in a desert in case you didn t know. it s to prevent skin cancer just like light skin is an adaptation to lack of sunlight since it makes it easier for the body to produce vitamin d.   so the color of the first humans would have likely depended on what africa looked like 150 million years ago  something we are unsure of.  and for the record almost every modern humans is descend from a small group of around 10 000 people that survived some event we don t know what the event was just that it happened  that nearly wiped out the human race.  we know this by analyzing mitochondrial dna.
@wonko the sane  i m aware of all of that for the most part actually. we re we disagree is in labeling and the use of certain terminology. are you saying all native american tribes comes from mongolians  because that s highly debatable. and then tell me where the mongolians originate from        also you kind of repeat without saying it the 3-4 bloodline origins. and many would disagree on the part of people being wiped out at some point. so there that. the idea of skin color being an adaptation comes from what evidence  as  black   melanin  has always been. there are  shades  of  black . people with it and people without it.        we have not just the unseen but the seen history of civilizations stretching back. that physical evidence of written works  and art tell us that many of the peoples were actually dark skinned people. darker than what those groups appear to be now. even in recent history original inhabitants of an area being exhaled or moved and the yet the remaining people keep the title. technically the caribbean is full of irish descendants yet most people won t agree. even though prima nocta  probably misspelled  was the meticulous farming and removal of all those born resembling the previous inhabitants by skin color. even today they are preserved  black irishman  and women in the caribbean. speaking about their history. we have written accounts that confirm those people at that time were  black . dark skinned people. that were removed. dna doesn t tell you location. the caribbean descendants wouldn t match the current irish inhabitants. who are the descendants of those that took over the land from the original inhabitants.        we also know it only takes 3 generations to effectively breed out the  black  skin tone. which has been covered thousands of times just within america and it s history with race. it s called passing.  white  people who have lived life believing they were  white  only to discover they are direct children of blacks people and are black themselves. we have seen this happen perfectly just within american history and even in other countries where slavery took place. so are you going to suggest that those people aren t  black  as they appear white and have for 3-4 generations        like i said there s the seen and the unseen that makes it more complex.
@mahatma1989  the black civilization has no connection with the egyptian civilization except for the 25th dynasty-former egyptian antiquities minister zahi hawass. hawass pointed out that egyptian temples contain drawings of egyptian kings. these sketches are depictions of men striking their enemies.the enemies are depicted as either african  nubian  libyan or asian  and all of them look very different in nationality from the egyptian kings.- zahi hawass
@mahatma1989  have you ever been to egypt   been in any of the ancient sites   seen the murals for yourself   egyptians and nubians were very very different from eachother.. separated by well over 1000 miles and separated by a deadly desert and even deadlier river.. go to egypt yourself.. and then come out with your claims.. especially the walls of pharoah seti the 1st tomb..
can egyptians claim her thou  she is greek macedonian not egyptian.
@jm gonzales  her family rule egypt for 300 years  its safe to say that they can since the ptolomes are a big part of their history.
@gabrielgray  but they still are not egyptian
@jm gonzales  still part of the history
@talynstarburst  hahaha! why are you so mad   so judgmental on what i chose to do that gives me enjoyment.
@bon bon  if you say so bon bon
@mike carson  only the 25th dynasty  a foreign dynasty to egypt  alike the greek ptolemaic dynasty  was proven to be black  please provide a source where cleopatra s sister was  black
@paul bentley   subsaharan  is a modern term to denote inferiority. the nubians created kemet  egypt it was a cultural movement that started south.  you need to do research before typing.
@conduit of the gospel darrellbe  thank you.the peopling of kemet was from black africans moving northward from southern and possibly also eastern africa to populate the nile where kemet  aka egypt  is now situated. no way in hell was ancient kemet aka egypt white or middle eastern.
@conduit of the gospel darrellbe  nah did it just means the lower part of africa.
i think pretty much anyone that value authenticity and preserving history as accurately as we possibly can would agree 110
@valkyrie  wednesday april 26th 2023  1832hrsvalkyrie 2 days ago@paul bentley  exactly egyptian were never black  but they can tan so they are white as for cloepathra  she greek.  black paintings.black statues.black wood carvings.historical eye-witness accounts of egyptians being black.egyptians used afro-pics to comb their afros  not that comb that you use for your stringy hair  but you assert that egyptians were never black in a continent where black people came from.hahaha!!!!
@kronos camron  kronos cam...   2 days ago @mike carson youhave no idea what you are talking about.  he s one of the very few who actually knows what he s talking about.
not western. american.
actually it started in france
brazil also caught that disease around 2015. now it s worse than ever. like doc ock said once   it s self sustaining now .
@dejan petranovi   it started in france and germany not america
@hunter zone  you want to tell me that france and germany introduced transexuals to the world  race swapping history characters  only country in europe that i know about race swapping is england which is the same as america. if you talk about equal human rights  there i can agree with you  but woke is no longer about human rights. it is something much more insidious. when it comes to equal human rights for every individual  except gays and trans and rest of the bunch  i agree absolutely. but when they start to race swap historic characters  let biological man compete against woman  hell no. and i never even heared of case like this anywhere in europe except britain
@dejan petranovi   yeah actually they did  they did it by creating postmodernism  broad skepticism  relativism and subjectivism  which is a basis for critical race theory and intersectional theory.therefore  albeit wokeism is predominantly american term  the concept all together is of western origin which started in france.
@mahatma1989  not every african looks like they come from nigeria  and they never have.
@mahatma1989  stop spreading these lies!
and you are right  it shocking stance from greece! they guys already called achilles and even zeus black !
@amrone mhb  greetings from a sicilian una faccia una razza
@valkiyri  the thing that hath been  it is that which shall be  and that which is done is that which shall be done  and there is no new thing under the sun.
@dejan petranovi   didn t you watch ars ne lupin   where omar sy  a senegalese actor   took on the role of ars ne lupin    based on a classic french novel   the french are starting to do it also
it started with marx. it s not american  its jewish to the core.
it s from the usa only not from every western country
@dejan petranovi   let s be real it s started in europe and american just speed it up  even some european are confused wtf is going on in us
@super nova  nope. i know who arsene lupin is. especially croatian version from comic  alan ford  named arsen lupiga which would translate in arsen hithim  p but i just checked the date when it launched for the first time. 2021. at the high of woke movement in america when absolutely every movie they made was woke. and woke  crap in america started waaay before 2021. already in 2016 they have started with this. now  this is first and only case i heared of in europe about race swap.  exept in  great  britain  and anne boylen being second one arsene lupen is fictional character so you can  forgive  that. cleopatra is a well established real world history  and they are changing it to be black even  though  it is well docummented that she is ptolomeic which would make he complete white  but europeans are not doing that. as for watching tv. my tv died 5 years ago and i don t give a flying fuck about it. never bought new one. i download what i want or go to cinema. rest are books books and more books  p took me only a month to get rid of tv and don t care about it anymore. thing is. again  we don t castrate children here. as far as i know no country in europe have a law which would alowe that to happen  except maybe  great  britain but since they left eu i no longer consider them europeans  p we don t use they them pronounce  and in croatia that will never happen trust me   p logged into warcraft month ago  for the first time in 10 years  and man. all i saw there are gay quests and they them pronounce. i have my own  hero  and he is only one of him. but then i heared npc s saying them to my hero. it s not 20 of me  it s only 1 of me. all this is coming from u.s. no europe. what i am saying is. woke started in america. few isolated cases happened in eu but nothing to be forried about. but we do need to be afraid of america s bulshit. would you buy a beer with transexual who have all male parts on it if they put his face on a can  i wouldn  p
woke is also in england and france but that is to be expected.
@meme guy  today yes but not as hardcore as it is in the us yet
sign  we also reject uneducated ignorance...as of 2019 they have dna tested egypt pharaohs remains and cleophatra sister remains all had black ancestry.  i would love for this lawsuit to be serious which it is not  cause there be a lot of apologizes from you guys which would be fun to read on here. so i say they go for it.
@mike carson  yeah ignore facts  and change history because you don t like it  like it is.
@mike carson  1 cleopatra s tomb was never discovered2. even if what they found really was cleopatra s sister  and it is not  it would be her half sister
@dejan petranovi   no. western.
@mike carson   i mean  you do realise that the ptolemaic family s tree was actually a circle more than the tree ! they were inbreeding because the royal family was seen as descendants of gods  thus  their bloodline was seen as not human but divine. if you check out the family  tree  you will see there are multiple references of both sister   wife under the names of her ancestors  with cleopatra vii also marrying not one of her brothers but two. the only person in that family tree that was not already family was cleopatra s grandmother  who was a concubine - but it s not even sure if she was connected with cleopatra vii only through marriage or also through the bloodline. therefore  stop with the nonsense and consider the constant family incestual practices and the fact that cleo was a macedonian greek  the chances of her having black ancestry  if any  is lower than 5 . moreover  because african ancestry  subsaharans  only came about to the egyptian throne around the 25th egyptian dynasty - and they came to power via invasion  tyranny and slavery - which is tacitly avoided often in western circles - considering it somewhat kills certain western  all white bad  narrative. ergo  that s like saying martin luther king jr. or malcolm x were white - if and because - their grandma or grand grandma was shagged by a white dude.
@supergodzilla99  fair enough
@dejan petranovi   what kind of books do yall think those  bad guys  were burning
@mahatma1989  this is false. black americans really think they ruled the world  meanwhile you guys can t even rule your own neigbourhoods.
no it isn t  anime characters look more white than japanese.
don t say that! the producer could send will smith to slap you really hard!
oh  never mind. i hope the lawyer wins.
i agree. i hope he rips them apart. enough is enough and their racism has gone entirely too far.
how pathetic from them to even steal actual historic characters now.this evil has to stop.
does this mean that we norwegians can sue hollywood for what they ve done to our culture and history too  i want personal compensation for the disaster that were the thor movies..
@that norwegian guy  thor is a mythological figure  while cleopatra was a real person.
the nelson  mandela the terrorist years has mel gibson as winne mendela.
@arkhan.  he was fictional.  a white fictional character - what point are you missing
@joe kerry  im not saying he shouldn t be white  quite the contrary. i m saying that race-swapping someone who was real is even worse.
glad to hear. someone has to stand up to these woke hollyweird racists.
is masri the preferred term over egyptian  i m just curious. i feel like i ve seen the term somewhere in the books i read earlier in the year  but i can t remember what it means or which book i might have seen it in.
@tahlia nerds out  yes masr is the arabic term for egypt
you re not egyptian. well you re not related to ancient egyptians kemites
@jibril  modern arabs aren t ancient kemites you re assuming a culture that your ancestors stole hundreds of years ago
they have done it with a black achilles and medieval renaissance britain already
@that norwegian guy  you honestly think hollywood gives a damn about cis white guys
@that norwegian guy  you could sue for them making jarl haakon a black woman.
they make king henry s wife black. ann was white.
sure. just find a lawyer interested in the case.
uh egyptians or black people  lol
@that norwegian guy the difference is that cleopatra is a real life person. if you watch the trailer for this movie. you ll understand why they are so upset. it s not just a movie. it s a documentary. netflix is presenting it as if it s historical fact that she s black.
we wuz kangz n pharaohs
people  memory hole the fact john wayne played genghis  kkan........ google  it.
@sailor.x  you need to bring up something from 70 yrs  i d delete that comment
@losah tattletales  you really  don t  want me to mention  the rabbit  hole of stuff from the 70s and 80s. you may not like what you find.
if they loose egypt shall do movie about martin luther king as white gay.
@mahatma1989  they re just in their feelings...
@mahatma1989  egypt s population for much of it s history isn t remotely anything like sub-sahara africa. it s always been made up of middle eastern and southeast mediterranean european stock. in fact  much of north africa is composed of arabs  berbers  and mediterranean european stock  throughout the centuries. just because they re in africa doesn t automatically translate to black. most of the actual black people are in sub-sahara africa.
@kainis01  you mean normal men. we don t use lefty code.
@paul bentley  i don t disagree with you. sometimes you have to dumb it down for leftists.
egyptian arabs complaining about black americans  stealing egyptian history  is like european americans complaining about someone stealing native american history. the arabs conquered egypt over 600 hundred years after the egyptian empire fell.
@dan the man  the arabs have been part of egypt since they ruled the levant. blacks  however  had it for a total of about 100 years in the entire 6000 history. funny thing is that after the blacks left  egypt basically became sort of a slum in many areas. kind of like what typically happens when blacks move into neighborhoods these days. open a book why don t you  cleatus
yeah. i mean imagine if you re someone who achieved some notable action for many years that makes people remember and appreciate who you are but suddenly this one guy out of nowhere says you re racist  evil and a bigot then tries to make up his her own version of your story that has no sources or claim to be.sounds like a screaming karen to me tbh.
@kainis01  the arabs didn t even exist as a people when egypt was founded. according to the history of the arabs themselves  ishmael was the founder of the arabian people and he was born at least 1000 years after the egyptian empire was founded. meanwhile  nubians  ie black africans  have been in the nile valley from before egypt even existed as a nation  and unlike arabs  nubians and egyptians shared a near identical culture and history. lastly  the oldest nubian complex site uncovered in lower egypt is 6000 years old. so black africans settled in northern africa 2000 years before arabs even existed as an ethnic group.
@mahatma1989    .it was rome s strength rather than egypt s weakness that brought about the end of the ptolemaic period. after defeating carthage in the punic wars  roman power was on the ascendancy. when cleopatra became queen  roman expansion was unstoppable.
@mahatma1989  the dynasty lasted for close to 300 years within those years egypt reached great heights   alexander the great built the city of alexandria and began to collect books to establish a library. this project was continued by the ptolemies  who transformed alexandria into a leading cultural center. the alexandria library became the most famous and important in the ancient meditaerranean world. the ptolemies adapted many aspects of egyptian life and customs  claiming the title of pharaoh and being recognized by the population as the their legitimate successors and the 31st dynasty. they took part in egyptian religious practices and were depicted on monuments in egyptian dress. they constructed temples  which were often consecrated during their state visits to the provinces. 4  these temples include those at edfu  deir el-medina and one in luxor. learning flourished and a synthesis between greek and egyptian culture developed. in this  the ptolemies continued alexander s project of cultural fusion. like the pharaohs  they claimed to be sons and daughters of the sun god  ra. they not only called themselves pharaoh but used all the titles of the earlier egyptian rulers. alexandria was also an economic center of significance. it was from egypt of the ptolemaic dynasty that the cult of isis spread throughout the roman empire. 5 during the ptolemaic period  the septuagint  the greek translation of the hebrew bible  was produced in alexandria  which was also an important center for jewish life. this translation was undergone at the request of the ptolemaic pharaoh. in its turn  it stimulated  and nourished the discipline of exegesis  which would so profoundly mark the development of both judaism and christianity.  6  towards the very end of the ptolemaic period  the jewish philosopher philo  20 b.c.e.-50 c.e.  set out to fuse jewish and greek thought. euclid of alexandria  325-265 b.c.e.  and archimedes of syracuse  287-212 b.c.e.  were among alexandria s most distinguished scholars. philometer vi had a jewish tutor  the famous aristobulus. during the reign of ptolemy v  new critical editions of homer  hesiod and pindar were produced at the great library. 7  it was also in alexandria that the writings on medicine that  form our hippocratic corpus were first brought together.  8   .
@dan the man  there s nothing called egyptian arabs come on man your lies have been exposed  egyptians we re never black  stop race hustling
@der magnus  serious question tho  do you feel the same way when they whitewashed her
@that norwegian guy  that norwe...  3 days agodoes this mean that we norwegians can sue hollywood for what they ve done toour culture and historytoo i want personalcompensation for the disaster that were the thor movies..   i m sorry...is thor a real individual  you palm-colored people crack me up.
@mahatma1989  ok but that doesn t change that cleopatra wasn t black though
@dan the man  cleopatra was still not black
@sailor.x  ya but they didn t label the movie as historic fact.huge difference .stop trying to wash this like it s ok cause feelings...
writing what   who history  if you want to be mad at someone rewriting the history you should be mad at the egyptologist! lolz
@arkhan hind  yes  a real person who was an egyptian woman with greek heritage  so she could have very well looked like the actor  black women who is mixed. what s the actual problem
@bon bon  she could have looked like which actor  the new one or the older one
@bon bon  as far as we know  cleopatra wasn t mixed.
@arkhan hind  as far as we know she wasn t 100  greek  we do know that at the time of her life that the actual greeks didn t consider her greek. we also know that she lived many generations from her great great great grand daddy ptallomy. we also know that their was some sex going on with the actual egyptian people lolz   that cleopatra is birthed generations later after all that good loving. so she s probably more likely a  mostly woman of color  or a  mixed woman of color  than a woman that s 100  greek. common sense  wouldn t you think
@arkhan hind  she could possibly look like the mixed woman playing her in the documentary that everyone is mad about but haven t actually watched. i don t see why people are so upset. if they make her more arab looking would they be more happy  even though we all know for sure that she wasn t arab
@g m  what have they done with medieval  renaissance britain  do you mean putting black people in pictures of the medieval times etc. sorry my friend but they were there sprinkled in. have you ever heard of the term blackamoores   garamantes
@bon bon  well  black anne boleyn comes to mind  as well as one silly netflix show  name escapes me  about victorian england  where fully half the court was black. which is curious  since its pretty certain there would not have been almost a single person who is black in the royal court at the time  except perhaps as an ambassador.
@dawn elder  that s funny because there are new studies to suggest that king henry himself was  exotic looking  meaning he wasn t as pail as the painted of him   his features were a little more bolder than what was painted of him. even though a british monarch his dna shows that he was of moroccan   algerian lineage. look it up yourself. we ve all been lied to i m afraid.
@g m  lolz but there were kings   queens of europe that had black blood   looked as if they had some black blood running through their veins. most of the time they would be painted as all white  but we re actually of mixed blood. for example look up queen charlotte. of england   ireland. also i don t know about king henry s wife but king henry didn t look anything like his painting  he himself was of moroccan   algerian linage as his dna shows .
the worst part is when they say that blacks are the olmec maya and they built the pyramids because grandmother said so that s their dna proof .now granny is egyptian wow they like building pyramids so shameful
egypt or kemet is in africa cleopatra the 7th was african and at most mixed with the ptolemaic blood line
they think that two wrongs make a right. a very immature perspective of the world.
they should have done a docuseries on queen nzinga actual african royalty who was a black women.
exactly
to be honest comparing a movie to actually conquering  exploiting and oppressing a nation is pretty exaggerating dont you think
@brad choksondik  no.
it s cultural revenge.
this is why  for example  the movies gods of egypt and exodus  gods and kings were banned in egypt even though they were fictional stories. this current case of cleopatra is certainly even bigger because the docu-series is supposed to be an educational documentary and not fiction and costume drama.
but there still black as in terms of aboriginal dna but they won t except it just like a lot of other cultures.
@warlord12  wtf are you talking about  lmfao
facts and even worst when cleopatra was greek so netflix insulting egypt  and greeks too.
usually  i m against litigious reactions  but i do respect the patriotism at work. people should care about how their country and its history is depicted on a global scale. us americans don t do that enough or in the right way.
@warlord12  true. i mean all you have to do is look at the painting on the walls in the pyramids. hell  even the women are painted having braids.
@ariel lezcano  yes  though as far an insults to macedonian greeks this is small potatoes.
egyptians banned the movie about egyptian president anwar sadat when hollywood hired a black man to play him.
oh  she d find a ton. and a lot of them with amazing stories that a lot of people never hear about. but i wouldn t be surprised if jada thinks she s above doing research. i m just surprised she didn t cast herself as cleopatra  honestly.
she knows the historical truth she doesn t care. her whole point was to try and have it her way and deliberately change it.
@christ is risen! her truth
@sassy ghost  they weren t as historically iconic so they don t count apparently. lmfao
the only research jada does is checking packages.
@hyperion  which is a shame. there are a lot of female figures in history that get pushed to the back. pirate queens  tribal leaders  warrior queens  village elders  matriarchal societies  etc. there s quite a number of women in history that we just don t hear about like we do male historical figures. even when you put race to the side. when you talk about non-white  non-european women the focus becomes even less. partially due to racism and sexism and also partially due to lack of record keeping and artistic depictions from the areas these women haled from. a docu-series could be made on forgotten women of history  honestly. and as long as it s historically accurate it would be a worthwhile watch.
@lark88  against who
hurt people hurt people
the worst thing is that they re being manipulated to do this  goaded on. they wouldn t go to these lengths on their own. no one does.
true!
yeah. the hypocrisy
@father pucci  i wasn t sure who that was  so i went to google.  i would love to watch a docuseries about her now!and why do people always focus on cleopatra when it comes to mainstream documentaries   cleopatra was interesting and great  but there was also ramses iii  akhenaten  hatshepsut  nerfiti  etc.
@shounenbat510  i like to look up random african stuff when i am bored sometimes. i wish i had the money to make a docuseries about her. cleopatra might be the most common egyptian taught about in non egyptian schools would be my guess.
@brad choksondik  honestly if it s only  fictional movie   no problem  but when it s documentaries  yeah  you re pretty much try to replace a race with other race.
funny how egyptian arabs had no issues with cleopatra being played by white english actress.
it was never about morality. it s all by narcissism. some women that want to be seen as  queens  at all costs. btw both these women are african american african british modern unique mixes  they didn t even exist back then. so even if cleopatra was actually west african they can t claim her.
@diginerd it was produced by entanglement queen jada. you know it s gonna be about them. they never learn from  everything s gonna be all white  documentary in showtime.
well said
they try to act same as their previous  current masters ..
@gt bondz  as shown in the video and also metatron  historian youtuber  we have a sculpture of cleopatra and then a historic painting with egyptian motifs that clearly shows the exact facial features of the sculpture and she was painted white. also dna is tricky  through modern genetics what i m about to say is fact  there are white people in ireland that are more genetically related to black african descent than they are to their white irish neighbors.
@warlord12  aboriginal  haha
@hyperion  yeah they are black or people of color. the evidence is in the paintings on the walls in the pyramids. the use a bronze color for their skin color and some of the paintings of the people are really dark. but the white historians always showed egyptians as white people. so who you going to believe  the people who draw themselves or someone else s depiction of what they think they look like.
where is egypt . in africa! the egypt civilization dates  back way before the greek. if you want to know what color agent egypt people were look at the paintings on the walls in pyramids. the evidence speaks for itself.
@gt bondz by genetics  the people of  ancient egypt were most similar to middle east cultures.  there was no basically no sub-saharan genes up until after 1000 ad.  this goes for both nobles and commoners.  the color scheme you are referring is also used for other middle eastern cultures.
@gt bondz  wow  you really need to educate yourself. north africans aren t black. and the color of the skin of people in egyptian paintings is very different  also depending on the ruling dynasty. in addition  women are often depicted lighter than men  and since they spent less time in the sun  it means that men are simply depicted as tanned.
i hate people who argue  akshtually cleopatra can be...  no  she can t and she s the face of egypt  marketing-wise. historians like zahi hawass say that she s white... netflix is going too far  it s not a cartoon character! the reason presented by the lawyer to sue is legit and f- jada smith is the opposition!
@anastasia astrild don t tell this poor soul about the persecution and murder of white africans in africa that happens to this day.
@gt bondz  even though most egyptians aren t black. cleopatra wasnt even native egyptian. she was greek. she was born in egypt but her roots are greek. nubians are black  they controlled egypt too for a long time. there were black nubian pharaohs. however egyptians themselves look more middle eastern. and again cleopatra was european so thats far from black.i ve been to egypt very recently  the paintings on the wall are mostly brownish red coloured. they look darker and tanned because well egyptians are that  but they re not black. there are paintings of black people since they lived there too. but there are also paintings of very light skinned people and saying europeans didn t exist in ancient egypt is also a lie. alexander the great and romans both conquered egypt. and cleopatra and the city of alexandria are direct evidence of europeans in egypt.
cleopatra wasn t a muslim arab any more than she was a sub-saharan african. she was greek lol!
@warlord12  what we don t accept as egyptian is the change of history to fit your narrative or feelings without any evidence    like this cleopatra  documentary   claiming she was black when in reality she was from ptolemaic dynasty which is mind boggling. keep in mind that we as modern egyptian are not greek so cleopatra doesn t reflect the current egyptians population but still she is part of our history as a greek egyptian and we won t allow someoneto change history so they feel important.
@gt bondz  bro just read a history book  it s not that hard.
so cleopatra was the only black in her family at that time.. who were her parents
@nasra abdullah  please tell them how the nubians look like. tell them about the look of people coming from meroe. educate them about the hitithes  the babylonians  the assyriens  heck drop some lines about the othomans and the arabs. if you fell like it speak about the french and british..i mean help them understand the gene pool of current day egypt. help them see what happened many centuries after the construction of all the pyramids and temples.
lets be fair now. hawass was well known for being fine with changing history if it was for a pro egypt bias.
@gt bondz  vikings wore their hair   beards in braids. i m pretty sure they weren t black.
@max master j  the last time i checked viking braids were not african braids  just as french braids has nothing to do with african braids
@gt bondz  egyptians are dark like johnny depp but that doesn t make them black. they had black slaves. that s what i find most amusing about american afro-centrism  for some reason you guys alway identify with the cultures  egypt  muslim  etc.  that have historically enslaved your kind on a wide scale  but you guys try to claim to be them. it s bizarre.
cleopatra was greek  a ptolemy. from alexander the great.
@gt bondz you don t like the truth don t you .
@gt bondz  paintings are bronze skinned people. aka arabs. nobody north of the sahara was or is black. sub saharans is where blacks come from. sure there are some exceptions. some asians are black skinned basically but point is egyptians were never black..
@warlord12   nope
@henry tilley till doesn t make them black ..phenotypically
what s mediterranean arab  what do you mean arab  they re arabophones just like amazigh people from north africa  arabophone kurds  turkic  persian  fennec  assyrian...etc from the middle east  bro  arabic is a tongue  not some race or ethnicity.people say    arab    in order to link north african arabophones to the middle east and it s disgraceful to say the least
@hyperion  first  cleopatra was greek. i m not disputing that. second  the arabs are the last group of invaders that led to the downfall of egypt. please research!
@terena rosa  responding to the wrong person  my guy.
@warlord12   black aboriginal  dna   thank you for your perfect illustration because most forget that the prophet muhammad was praised specifically for being white.and it s precisely reckless statements like that which would get you killed in the middle east. the prophet muhammad was very clear that anyone who considered him black should be killed with no opportunity to repent and these are sahih le-vel narrations.ahmad ibn abi sulayman  the companion of sahnun  said   anyone who says that the prophet was black should be killed. ibn musa al-yahsubi  qadi  iyad  p.375
as they should they have one of the most interesting history
good for them.  so sick of the woke bs
@max master j  you are sooo slow sorry
@nathan evans know your history please thank you
@hyperion  i m a girl.
@hyperion  i was explaining to you what they were  on about  because you were confused.
@tulkas81  um you do know nubia did conquer egypt and ruled  for 100 years right.  and that  happened  way before  cleopatra.  just google  it.
this is mainly an issue here in america which stems from militant activism and a lack of historical and cultural geographic knowledge. i once had an interesting conversation with an egyptian woman at a convention in la years ago and it was about this very topic and let me tell you  she went off!she was a typical olive skinned mediterranean type and she said.  look at me  we are the egyptians!  i told her i know  my heritage is under attack too sometimes  me being sicilian  some of them are trying to claim ancient greece rome  and practically the whole mediterranean as well.it s actually quite sad and pathetic if you think about  it s like saying i m not happy with my heritage so i think i ll steal yours.my question is why aren t they being encouraged to research their own ancestry which is mainly west sub-saharan africa instead of allowing them to covet other cultures and their history.
@peter sardina  you can lay the blame at the feet of archeologists  of the late 19th  and early  20th  century.  back then when a great structure  was found  in sub saharan africa.  these  people  would claim  europeans built it because  no african  could make  such a structure.  and this was the official  line right up into  the 1960s. it took nonracist researchers going into those areas and doing honest  work to set the record  straight.  but by then the damage  was done. now because  of what was done  then people  will latch onto this stuff because  of the past wrongs done to their history.  there are documentaries  that cover how history  was censored for 80 years.
@gt bondz  1  braids don t imply a specific ethnicity. that s on the verge of racism. actually egypt during those time periods had an issue with lice. many egyptians shaved their heads. the crazy hairstyles and braids were usually from wigs they used to hide their shaved head.2  native egyptians were definitely ppl of color. they just weren t sub saharan black. most of northern africa is more mediterranean  middle eastern in appearance.3  cleopatra was descended from alexander the great. here family line  ptolemy  took over rule of egypt after alexander s death. she was born in egypt many generations after alexander  but her ppl were mostly greek  macedonian in descent. there is some debate as to whether her line mixed with native egyptians at any point or if they stuck too inbreeding  which was common in her family. but even if she did have some egyptians ancestry  she still wouldn t have been black.
@david franz
@sassy ghost  read my comment to op
the main idea is cleopatra is the most famous historical queen. and i don t just mean as egyptian queen  but in the world history.they need to make her theirs
@sassy ghost  ironically seeing as she s lighter skinned than the woman she did cast she would have made a better casting. she looks closer to cleopatra than the dark brown girl does.
@kirivan yam  i mean that one old lady did say her grandma told her not to listen to reality and to listen to her fantasies instead and she said okay granny.
@sassy ghost  and it would appease the left by ticking all of the little boxes they like having ticked and it would make us happy by being history.
macedonians were greeks. why the
well  not 100  greek macedonian as there was both syrian and persian in her lineage and then there is that little thing about not knowing the ancestry of her mother  who could have been greek macedonian or native egyptian or something else .  but  why mention these facts when we can just parrot the most common assumptions  instead of doing our own research  right
@derek mitchell  that. but it s just too easy for the outrage machine to farm their cattle for clicks revenue. i am pretty sure a whole bunch of content creators does not share the sentiment but exploit it - pretty much the same as the  generic reaction meta .
@mamamob  you re saying this because you know what cleopatra actually looked like  right   i mean  you saw her in person  and are not just basing this on word of mouth and highly stylized paintings and sculptures of her that were created centuries after her death  right
@sassy ghost  cleopatra wasnt bald though lol
@derek mitchell  history lesson for you. egyptian royalty interbred. she didn t have syrian or anything else. she was greek macedonian. her whole family was ptolemaic. they didn t water down their gene pool with the locals.
@drivenby  you have no idea how hard i just laughed. i was not expecting that comment when i checked my notifications.
@derek mitchell  but all of the named ancestries are more on the whiter  mediterranean side. she was a royal  so there wouldn t be a commoner in her bloodline. syrian qnd persians  same as native egyptians looked mediterranean. royals  highly borns where most often whiter  because they didn t need work outside.  paleness was a beauty feature. also  her family tree wasn t a tree  but a circle  so that the  divine  blood stayed pure. there are pictures of cleopatra vii  in which it is clear that she was white  even though not as beautiful as presented today.
@tom mullins  well  cleopatra vii  inherited a little bit of persian blood via marriages of seleucid queens into the ptolemaic dynasty. seleucid dynasty was also a macedonian dynasty  just like ptolemies  but seleucus i used his marriage to apama i  a persian sogdian  to legitimize his rule over persia. apamas great-granddaughter berenike ii  who was 1 8 persian  married into the ptolemaic dynasty and was cleopatras ancestor. another seleucid queen that married into ptolemaic dynasty  cleopatra syra  had also a drop of persian blood in her as her great great grandfather was persian aristocrat and founder of the kingdom of pontus  mithridates i. all these seleucid queens were born centuries before cleopatra vii though  so she had only a drop of persian blood and was overwhwelmingly macedonian greek.
she doesn t need to read history  she simply asks her grandma
@sch tzcken01  i don t know what color cleopatra s skin was.  i am not saying she was a black woman because i don t know.  it seems that she most likely was not black and i can understand people not wanting to see her portrayed as black when she probably was not.  but  many people are expressing outrage and seem offended that  a black woman is portraying her.  they are behaving like it is the most horrible thing to ever happen for a black woman to portray cleopatra!  that feeling seems racist to me.personally  i prefer historical films and documentaries to be accurate because the purpose of such films is to educate and inform us about history.  if they are not accurate  then the film makers are just lying to the public.i do believe that jada pinket was wrong for casting a black woman as cleopatra and she did it to push an afrocentric agenda.if she wanted to uplift black people and show great historical women of african decent  there are plenty of actual african queens she could have chosen to make a film about.  by choosing to cast a black woman as cleopatra  jada is attempting to steal and highjack that heritage.  so  i can understand some people s anger about that.  however  some of their comments seem to also suggest racist feelings toward black people.
@derek mitchell  the problem isn t that she is played by black person. the problem is that they literary say in the trailer that facts don t count  but that there opinion is more important. i don t care what they tell you in school  cleopatra was black  calling a series a documentary in which an  expert  makes such a statement is a mockery. i can understand why the egyptians take this as a grave insult. the problem is afrocentrism. there is no evidence whatsoever for their theories  but they are being spread ever louder. it is proven with dna tests that the ancient egyptians were not majority black and yet there is a loud group that claims that the ancient egyptians were black and the modern egyptians are all collonists and have no right to their land. these are statements that remind me very much of hitler and his followers. one of their theories is that cleopatra is black. the fact that netflix is putting out a  documentary  in which it is now claimed that she is black is a clear sign that this  documentary  does not follow any facts. for me  this is not a coincidence. this is called rewriting history. because all the facts point to the conclusion that cleopatra was not black.
doesn t jada have white blood
thats like saying americans are mostly  brittish. she was egyptian with greek and persian ancestry..she wasn t black but she was egyptian..americans stop messing with everyones history
@derek mitchell  egyptians  syrians and persians all aren t black.
@david franz  the packages of her son s friends.
it is also lost on her how diverse africans are. there are africans in countries like ethiopia that actually look similar to caucasian people and africans that look similar to asians  even having the epicanthic fold and these are genes they have without mixing with other ethnicities and most likely where asians and europeans inherited their genes from before they migrated out of africa. there are literally so many groups  yet the west are trying to twist the narratives and say they are only supposed to look a certain way like having dark skin and braided hair or something which is an oversimplification if i have ever heard one.
yep. while there was likely some intermingling between their nubian and egyptian subjects  egypt was a vast empire at its height after all  the ruling classes of egypt likely never saw an influx of nubian genes as they would not have been recognized as nobility in those days.add to that the prevalent trend among pretty much all noble houses across the world in a vast array of cultures to set themselves apart from the common folk by keeping themselves paler than their subjects to show that they did not need to work in the sun.
well technically cleo is still an african queen  shes just not black african.. she was born there  as we were born in the usa or canada  my line is danish  but i identify as canadian.. so.. technically she is an african queen. egypt is still a part of africa.
@gabrielgray  she isn t african though in the way they are suggesting she is.
yeah even with the fact that they are in fact africans themselves.
cleopatra was greek in ancestry .
@hyperion  you know that europeans back then never had an interest in egypt to claim as their own history until 1800. as for cleopatra being greek  she mostly likely has sub sharan african ancestry  and probably mixed. you do know that their was a time where the greeks lived with the egyptians right  and at that time the greeks was educated on the mystery schools by the egyptians. all this talk about the greeks  egyptians being white or black  when no one during that time ever identify with their skin color. the ancient greeks never called themselves white or black  and it was the same with egyptians.race colorline bs talk came from oligarchy europeans who want to divide and conquer people. the irish and african slaves fought during the bacon rebellion  and sadly lost. it was 1676 when they start to divide these groups by calling them white and black. it was anthropologist and scientist who came up with all these racial terms to divide people. that s why they had scientific racism. look that up
they aren t afraid of being called racist like we are  which is why we just roll our eyes and carry on when  say  anne bolyne is race-swapped instead of calling people out for changing history.
@terena rosa  my question was asked somewhat facetiously. i wanted thems to explain in detail exactly what claims they were making so they could be easier to dismantle  specifically on what they think an aboriginal is. as for what you wrote  maybe you should be the one to brush up on your history. how tf could you forget about the ottoman turks and claim to know anything about egypt  lol.
@hyperion  i said the arabs were one of the last invaders  not the only ones. once you stop being defensive maybe you ll be open to learning facts and improving your reading comprehension skills.
@terena rosa   the arabs are the last group of invaders that led to the downfall  what do i have to be defensive about
@sailor.x  and the fact that european colonizers like napoleon for example  vandalizing the statues of egyptian s noses  everywhere you find these statues they got no nose !!! if egypt was truly european origin  they wouldn t disrespect those statues like that smh   they won t dare do that to their own figures of history in their countries!
@hyperion  idk  you just got a little crazy sounding in that last comment
cleopatra wasn t egyptian or african  she was greek from macedonian and was brought to eypgt by her roman father alexander the great when the roman had dealt with the egyptians. this is blatant race swapping
@gt bondz  yes  ancient kemetians were black.
@dean firnatine   egyptians banned the movie about egyptian president anwar sadat when hollywood hired a black man to play him.  anwar sadat was black!!!wtf are you talking about  willis  !!
@henry tilley    @gt bondz  as shown in the video and also metatron  historian youtuber  we have a sculpture of cleopatra and then a historic painting with egypti...   metatron is an idyiot and many of his videos claiming numerous things have been debunked.
@terena rosa      yeah ok. anyway  what was that you were saying about reading comprehension  i m still laughing.
this lawsuit is going nowhere.
@gt bondz  that argument is simply preposterous  are braids naturally created and part of dna or man made and part of a culture  the fact that some two centuries ago did dismiss the presence of people of central african appearance doesn t mean historian described them as white  most historian considered them to be like mediterraneans north africans.we also know the history and origin of cleopatra  where did she came from
@hyperion  aggression is met with aggression
lol ancient egypt was founded by black people  africans. ptolemy only came to egypt in the dying days. arabs current days egyptians only conquered egypt in 625 ad  so cry more please.
@gt bondz  braids  lmfao that style of hair is known as a dutch or french braid..... you played yourself have a wonderful day
@gt bondz  egyptians are caucasians not blackyou didn t see the pyramidsi live therei never see black people in egypt egypt is for egyptians
@anastasia astrild  yep you said the truthwe all born white but sun tan us since our schools swimming pools streets are subjected to extreme sun
@mahatma1989  where do you collocate cleopatra on the history line and where did she came from  that is the object of discussion
my brother in law is egyptian. most funniest nice guy to be around but will become a literal wild man when somebody tries to claim his heritage and history
@daniel malinen  hi  i think the reason for that one movie about pharoah to be banned is due to respect to moses  many of us don t portray prophets with real actors or images   but could be that too  its just preference but tbh i think it has been proven beneficial with all the race arguements like this one  imagine they change or give prophets races  it becomes a mess with lots of disrespectful discussion here and there  as such prophets are always portrayed as light  not white person  just literally light  no showing
@dean firnatine  cuz he was not a subsaharan african he was half egyptian and half nubian
@gt bondz  ancient egyptians depicted themselves as tanned people and they made sure to depict their enemies who were black egyptians were not black at all look up king tut shield or canes
@gt bondz  india is in africa although they don t look like the chinese  arabs are in asia they don t look like the chinese as well what are you trying to imply race hustler
@william jenkins  what your evidence
@terena rosa  no that not true arabs were kicked out of egypt by the albanians and the last group to invade egypt was the british i bet mr tyrone didn t tell you that in the hood
except their figures were not mediterranean or arab.
@max master j   johnny depp does not have dark skin  what are you smoking
@bonni mc  what does woke mean
@warlord12  europe is closer to egypt than africa. look up geography textbooks and history books
yes  we are very proud of our history! we don t like anyone to make mockery of it  not to mention stealing !
@mohamed adel  who lives there currently  the british  no  the arabs do.
@mohamed adel  also  allah isn t real. repent and give yourself to christ.
@mohamed adel  arabs invaded north africa and egypt in 652 ad.so it begs the question...who inhabited egypt before  you guessed it.. black africans!!!
@mohamed adel  go get your own history and stop trying to whitewash black african egyptians
the horror!
@warlord12  actually modern egyptians have more sub-saharan dna than ancient egyptians had. genetic studies say they would have looked fairly similar to native americans in the us or a mix between native americans and middle eastern.  if you want a  black  empire you need to go further south and look at the nubian empire.
@gt bondz  egyptians shaved their heads and wore wigs.  and they would have most likely resembled native americans or a mix between native americans and middle eastern people.  we have studied their dna and modern egyptians have more sub-saharan dna than ancient egyptians did.
@henry tilley  that s because much of the celtic people actually originated in the iberian peninsula and migrated to what is present day ireland.
@gt bondz  according to their dna they would have had a color similar to modern native americans.  fun fact. modern egyptians have more sub-saharan dna than ancient egyptians did.
@gt bondz  no they were northern african not sub saharan african.  genetically these are separate groups. their skin color would have resembled native americans or middle eastern people.  if you want a  black  or sub saharan empire you want the nubian empire. though the nubians did conquer egypt for a little bit.
@tulkas81  their skin to e would have resembled middle eastern or possibly native american peoples  through they have no relation to native americans
@brad choksondik  while there is debate by looking at dna it s believed ancient egyptians had a skin tone similar to native americans  though they are unrelated just like australian aboriginals and sub-saharan africans are unrelated
@max master j  i think they have a deeply ingrained inferiority complex so try to appropriate the achievements of of other civilizations.
@the180degreerule  believe it or not dna studies have shown ancient egyptians probably had a skin tone closer to native americans than middle eastern people.
@sailor.x  but it didn t have much impact on the areas genetics. modern egyptians have more sub-saharan dna than ancient egyptians did.
@super trendy money maker  no we have a pretty good record of her genealogy. her family married other greeks or practiced inbreeding almost exclusively in an effort to  keep the line pure . it s possible there is some sub saharan dna but not enough to give her dark skin.
@warlord12  good i hope the  documentary  is shut down
@nasra abdullah
egyptians are north african not arabs. arab are not mediterranean  they ate exested in saudia   which not a mediteranean country.
@peter sardina
@r b  were it has been debunked  robert sepher is an anthropologe and he said it too. kemet means black soil and not black ppl.
@mahatma1989  only one crying are you because of the backlash.
@mr. riffian  true but genetically north africans are closer to middle eastern and mediterranean people than they are ro sub saharan africans.  if you wanna know the specific skin color of egyptians it s believed their skin tone would have been similar to modern native americans.
@wonko the sane  my point actually sir. we are talking at least 10- 15 percent saharan african dna. i am not saying she was all the way african. but to say that there was no african rule in egypt by many of these comment here is bs! i see some comments laughably admit that egyptians had darker skin color  but they are not african lol!!! so what are they dark europeans  you could say the afar people of ethiopia with straight noses like europeans  and they are african. still people also leave out the connection of sudan to egypt.
@super trendy money maker  no we are not we are talking maybe 2 to 5 percent for cleo. her family rules egypt for 300 years and she was the first of her family to even learn the language.  does that sound like a family that would take lovers from the native population   as i said we have a fairly good record of who her family married.  she isn t some ancient ruler  like king tut.  and ancient egyptians are north african but that isn t the same as sub saharan.  egyptians would have had according to genetic studies  a skin tone similar to modern native americans. though by the time of cleo the had mixed heavily with middle eastern peoples and would look closer to them.
egyptians are not arab. they are a mixture of cushites  greek  french and arab.
@tulkas81  nope. they were not. middle eastern culture has nothing to do with the building of the pyramids or pharaohs. please go to school
@iyaaltabu  that s true for modern egyptians. ancient egyptians were mostly north african though there is some debate that sumerians my have mixed with them a bit.  either way their skin tone would have been close to modern native americans  according to their dna
@iyaaltabu  he s probably confusing modern egyptians and ancient egyptians.  ancient egyptians were north african with possibly a little sumerian mixed in and according to their dna would have had a skin tone similar to modern native americans.
@iyaaltabu  french
modern egyptians or the modern inhabiters are not the ancient kemites  they expressed their negritude everywhere. you re literally delusional to think otherwise.how s plato describe them
@conduit of the gospel darrellbe  hey you do realize we have literally analyzed mummy dna right.  modern egyptians have more sub saharan dna than ancient egyptians did.   they were north african with maybe a bit of sumerian mixed in.  and their skin tone would have been fairly similar to modern day native americans. no they weren t white but they were not black.   there were awesome black nations  the nubian empire rivaled egypt for example and even conquered egypt for a bit . but egypt was not one of those nations.
agree
well according to google coptic is north african people! plus what about them pyramids in sudan connecting to egypt everyone here forgets to talk about  you talking about afrocentric  when it was always eurocentric that was doing all the coverups  and they vandalized all the noses  of many of those egyptian statues!
@super trendy money maker  they don t like to hear the truth. it slowly kills them.
lol ancient egypt was founded by black people  africans. ptolemy only came to egypt in the dying days. arabs current days egyptians only conquered egypt in 625 ad  so cry more.
@mahatma1989  factz they ain t ready for us conscious black folks
they re trying to erase hebrews israelites native americans and a few other cultures as well.
well said  mina!
@mahatma1989  dna shows the modern coptic people are most closely related to the ancient egyptians. ancient egyptians were not black. we have enough mummies to disprove the false claims of afro-centrist. the afro-centrist instead of making false claims that about ancient mediterranean civilizations that are easily disproven  should promote wider knowledge of the many civilizations indigenous to sub-saharan africa. if they want to lay some claim to ancient egypt  then they should stick to the handful of nubian dynasties that ruled egypt.
not just any greek  a member of the famous ptolemy dynasty that was one of the successors to alexander the great s legacy. her lineage is as easy to secure as macedonian greek as there can be historically speaking ffs.
@hyperion  correct. her lineage is critical to her story and relevance.
yes  both caesar and marc antony were obsessed with her. i highly doubt proud powerful romans with reputations to protect  would of been if she were black.
@mahatma1989  even if ancient egyptians were black  that doesn t change the fact that cleopatra was greek. the ptolemaic dynasty were either married to each other or other greeks throughout alexander s former empire.
@mahatma1989  what are you trying to say  this is about cleopatra not about egyptians.
@mahatma1989  how many vodka did u drink today
@gamera love  trying to say that there are many lies to this day about the color and race of the people of ancient egypt. since you don t know the race of cleopatra s other parent  who are you to say unequivocally and with 100  assurance that cleopatra isn t at least half black
@mahatma1989  i m talking about cleopatra. read a book and stop being immature.
@mahatma1989  itsf funny they didn t depict themselves as black....
@super trendy money maker  hawass added that in recent years a trend emerged  led by black americans and blacks in south america  claiming that the egyptian civilization is of black origin.he stressed that such claims were completely false.the black civilization has no connection with the egyptian civilization  hawass said  pointing out that the black civilization did not rule egypt except in the twenty-fifth dynasty during the era of the kingdom of kush  i.e. at the end of the ancient egyptian civilization.hawass pointed out that egyptian temples contain drawings of egyptian kings. these sketches are depictions of men striking their enemies. the enemies are depicted as either african  nubian  libyan or asian  and all of them look very different in nationality from the egyptian kings. former egyptian antiquities minister zahi hawass not even egyptians like black americans. they think you are diseases
you need to look into tariq nasheed   dr. umar johnson   all of their works. it will make sense.
@super trendy money maker  what you re talking about. have you heard about nagada culture  the former of ancient egipt  egiptian never has been black  except xxv dynsty  called nubian.
@wooo woo  well...i m still waiting!!!
at this point i kinda feel like some of these companies do the woke crap to spite people and get backlash. very petty and immature stuff indeed
i would have thought that they would have learned by now.. but nope  they keep doubling down every time
like they ruin witcher.
it s the same actress i believe. i could be wrong
there was little backlash because most ppl saw it as bait and not falling for it.plus there s so many shows and movies of anne boleyn. it s easier to dismiss.
@danielle daniel  different actress  jodie turner-smith is about to further ruin star wars
uk can get you to scotland yard just by misgndering crazies. no backlash will ever happen for sure. specially the very privilege virtued race compared to others.
bbc did it as well with queen margaret.    the hollow crown  and achillies in troy.    fall of a city   and other examples too
i remember that discussion about the anne boley costume drama as an argument about the ethnicity of boley and queen elizabeth ii  but it seems to have ended at the same time as this boley series. or the conversation ended when people looked from the online they looked online to see what the persons in question actually looked like and their interest to make noise about the series ended there.
netflix has also done this before. have we forgotten black aquiles  and what about the bbc portraying black british roman legionnaires  this is not new
@jo o farinha  the history channel as well . a tudor   war of the roses  with several black people in it .
@firefox riouyh  that s what wokesters count on. us normal people not reacting out of not taking the bait or out of fear. that s how they gained terrain.
@mike m.s.  exactly. which is why they re getting more  stunning and brave   everytime. but egypt isn t uk or us. neither do the rest of the world. try swapping chinese emperor with black woman  and let us see what will happen.
i find that disrespectful the fact that anna is a historical figure  not a fictional one and to make fun of her like this shows that they have no respect at all  just to make a movie wtf the woman really has a portrait of what she looks like in real life
nobody watched it.
i just read this after my own appraisal of this farce.
they made boleyn congolese
@mike m.s.  if it fails then it loses money. it doesn t gain anything when it s proven to lose money. starve them of attention then they lose power. sure be vocal about it sometimes it just fans the fire.these lawyers are a great for actually doing something about it than just being vocal on the internet. and i commend them for it.
anne boleyn was a fair skinned bi racial that s why you think she was white. she was half white but also black there was no historical inaccuracy.
@tofester  prove it
i remember hearing about that and just rolling my eyes and scrolling on. was that an actual documentary  i thought it might have been intended to be more of a historical fiction. i don t like that either  but it is less offensive than outright trying to race-swap cleopatra and claiming it as fact. a producer would have to be brain-dead to try to claim that anne boleyn was black in reality  the only way i can imagine they got away with it must have been to call it fiction and claim creative license.netflix really stepped in it by boldly claiming in their  factual  documentary that they knew better than all previous scholars that cleopatra was black because they want her to be.
@tahlia nerds out  its just virtue signalling at the high3st order
i thought that movie was an experiment.
@tofester  anne s father was thomas boleyn  a white man  and her mother was elizabeth howard  a white woman  so how exactly was she bi-racial
@edd hardy  she was adopted by them. the story that was never told.
@tofester  ...and where did you hear it
netflix also race and gender swapped a real life viking in their netflix show.
but british are white and not dark beige like egyptians and british people din t  live in africa near sudan  but in europe.
@slenderfoxx37  yeah but lets be honest look at how many centuries. whites have been race swapping in the movies that they make. there s tons of movies of them acting as indians  asians and black people.
wokapatra is born
she ll lead the assyrian army into battle against the imperial japanese army on d-day  june 6th  673bc.
@james goodman  i thought jennifer lawrence did that
don t forget to add  she also be depicted to sideline both julius caesar and mark anthony. also  octavius was depicted as the evil white man. the woke narrative is so predictable  it makes me .
wakanda forever! we wuz kangz n shiet
@james goodman  you should have made the date january 6th.....  for lulz
the docu will totally bash men.
she s a strong independent woman who don t need no man! while using sex and children to attempt to entrap men to secure her position.
oh  i think the trailer says she was a  warrior  queen.
they portray her in the trailer wielding a blade and fighting.  so yes.
think the trailer has her fighting training with a sword and winning.  so yeah  they will probably put that in there.
i know  adapting the story for modern day mentality when the reality of cleopatra is that she was a beast in her own right  married all her brothers just to kill them to guarantee her power was unchallenged
wow  now that s what i call a perfect fusion of old and new! nice nick  nice.
lol
haha touche
this would actually be worth watching loluse cleopatra to critique the sacred cows of today.
one of the best comments!
my favorite part is when cleopatra twerks while eating kfc
smith took the role because she related to someone who slept with different men to achieve and retain power  but still failed. i hear smith bought interest in a snake farm though  so maybe things will work out for her!
history doesn t really say it  but marc antony is significantly bigger that octavian...
haha amazing!
macedonian
@spamkromite macedonian greek
both would be even better but egyptian alone  is funny as well and once more jada loser smith
@spamkromite  a distinction without a difference.
yes greeks out there need to speak out too.
@myles  no real difference. they are referring to greeks but by different time periods and rulers.
@spamkromite  macedon was a hellenic kingdom that spoke greek
@spamkromite  hellenic its better
maybe they should it would help the country financially
time to push back before it will escalate further.they have their own history and culture.
they need to file a class action lawsuit
@spamkromite  macedonians were and are greek. you must mean the slavs that try to convince everyone that are macedonians right  slavs came to south europe centuries later
netflix ceo is greek ! unreal
greek taxi drivers are chill.
the problem is neither modern day egypt or modern day greece has any relevance to ancient egypt or ancient greece  completely different people occupy those lands now  greek citizens likely have no shared dna to ancient classical greeks  modern day egyptians likely have some ancient egyptian dna but heavily arab influenced  and definitely not ptolemaic greek. so both countries claiming cultural heritage have really no right   a random american might have more ancient greek dna than a random greece citizen or random egyptian citizen in a modern sense
@ariel lezcano  modern greeks aren t  greeks  in the sense of the ancient world  ptolemaic greeks were hellenistic people  modern day greeks are descendants of christian peoples living under turkish rule  see how there s little to no correlation
i really don t see the country of egypts point of view  sure it might be afrocentric but modern egyptians are basically mostly arab peoples  surely sharing dna of ancient egyptians but they definitely have no cultural relevance or heritage tied to ptolemaic macedonian egypt lol.
yes but modern day greeks trying to claim any heritage to classical ancient greeks is laughable   they simply aren t the same peoples
as an egyptian i would love greeks support  but cleopatra was egyptian greek  her ancestors ruled egypt and lived there for 300 years  so she is 9 04 as much egyptian as greek to us.our problem is not just cleopatra but it is the fact that afrocentrics are attempting to blackwash the whole ancient egyptians civilization.
@josiah saldana  l modern greeks have the same dna to the ancient greeks what are you smoking  i can find many articles and researches supporting that
@spamkromite  the  north macedonians  are bulgarians...
maybe because she was born in egypt  but her parents were not egyptian.
@sema tawy  as an egyptian you do know that the kingdom of nubia used to rule over egypt for a thousand years and they had numerous black pharaohs tho right   meaning ancient egypt more than likely had mixed blood with middle eastern sun saharan population at one point   thus making ancient egyptians not necessarily as dark skinned as denzel washington but likely with some negro facial features such as nose and lips and hair. but that was way way way back in time. most of egypt dna pool is arabic now  and also egypt is in africa   don t throw rock at your brothers from down south   we do not own hollywood and their decisions
@anthony mukoko  no that is not correct  actually egypt ruled nubia  kush  for 700 hundred from 1400 bc  kush ruled egypt for almost 100 years during the 25th dynasty.if there are any nubians monuments or scriptures detailing their occupation of egypt  the dates  the names of these nubians kings  obviously this would be written in nubian language as you definitely know that they spoke a different language than ancient egyptians  please share them.i know you will not be able to provide any because this imaginary history never happened
greeks are more jaded about this sort of thing  probably because there s been more shows and movies about greece over the years than about egypt. afrocentrism is very annoying  but not much worse than the nordicism that preceded it. it s more annoying now because there s been a widespread cultural and academic backlash against nordicism but such a backlash is still in its early stages against afrocentrism. the bigger focus is on the academic side of things. settle things there and you ve cut off the roots of the cultural vines. the latter can still grow  but it will be harder for them to find support when questioned. from what i understand afrocentrism is past its peak  academically  and currently on the decline  being increasingly considered pseudoscience.
@mahatma1989  you forgot to add  according to my grandma
@snowfox  probably half  which means nothing  like all the half  greek  americans like aniston  they re not greek by any metric other than 1 parent.
@josiah saldana  we are actually  greeks hardly mixed with other peoples  and even under turkish rule islam didn t allow muslims to marry christians  so those that might have converted to islam were sent off to turkey in the population exchange anyway. cope harder  at least our people actually have history.
@kostas biker  i m with you. even i  as an egyptian  i m saying she was greek buy my point was  even if she was egyptian from her mom side  she would still not be black! as egyptians were never black and not mention that neither greeks  egyptians or romans would have mix with dark skin ppl! impossible
since it s being presented as true fact  they are likely subject to defamation requirements.
i found it stunning and brave when cleopatra led the jedi into battle on top of her gundam against the umbrella corporation led by the dali lama.  so inspiring when she announced her pronouns while raising her new ak-47 above her head.
adele james   if you don t like the casting  don t watch the show. us   you keep using those words. i do not think they mean what you think they mean.
back when my mom was in school  late 60 s or early 70 s  her teacher tried to teach that cleopatra was black. so they ve been trying at it for awhile.
it is strange to say the least  for all the talk of  diversity  and  representation  they still chose to ignore history and go for  cultural appropriation
even though i am a british citizen and as far as i know due to being adopted  i do not have any greek or egyptian heritage and yet i still firmly choose to stand alongside the greeks and egyptians in fighting against this blatantly racist  documentary .
netflix gets sued  melonie gets to make a video  i get entertainment. everybody wins  even netflix because they win a stupid prize for playing a stupid game
wow  wikipedia actually has artist depictions of her on the page  showing her to be clearly light skinned  and possibly red hair   i figured they would have taken them down by now in solidarity with the show.
its like netflix saw the backlash from gals casting and wanted to bend the knee to the woke snowflakes. their  documentary  is literally a direct response to this. tbh im actually looking forward to gals portrayal. she clearly cares about historical accuracy and is passionate about the character. i think gals casting is great. looking forward to her movie.
netflix has become a parody of itself.
its a shame and a disgrace whoever did this should be ashamed and rot in shame screw you netflix
should we be rewriting history just to make people feel good  that s not history  that s psychiatry. - edward koch
i feel like by letting alexander hamilton be portrayed by a person of color without any kind of serious backlash  it just opened the door for this to happen. i have zero doubt the director had visions of black cleopatra being the next worldwide historical hit.
if only consumers worked together to boycott things  the world would be a much better place... sadly  there are no platforms or websites that make it easy for consumers to organize a boycott.
keep bringing us and keeping us informed
it isn t representation  it s replacement. thank you for bringing this news forward.
cleopatra was greek  its funny how jada is not a scholar and she thinks she know all about her.
i m egyptian and i ve been watching and supporting you for a long time now  i m also muslim and i support ur christian beliefs.so regardless of our country or religion we must stay together against those wokes. stay strong melonie.
as i actually carry ancient egyptian dna genes due to my ancestry i find this really offensive! go melonie love your content! i m rooting for this egyptian lawyer!
so glad that finally someone made the right move.i am an egyptian  no one here likes this false portrail of cleopatra who was indeed patolomec and fair skinned. we signed a petition that gathered 100k in hours but it was taken down claiming its racist. egyptians in general are not black  most are tanned and some in the south have drarker skin but completely different features from central africans.i myself am fair skinned  since i am from northern egypt and people in north africa have mediterranean features as you go more south you find more tanned skin tones. we don t have to be black because we re africans  look at asians for instance. there are indians  chinese  arabs etc and they all look different.so tired of hollywood falsifying my country s history.
nope. cleopatra is dead. she won t suffer any damages.
@j harris  yes  but current tourism and international image would.
if so then it should go to the greeks because cleopatra wasn t egyptian she was greek.
@tofester  yes  and the greeks could really use the money these days.
@j harris  defamation of a dead person is even worse than defamation of the living. she can t defend herself!
@tofester  cleopatra was egyptian. don t care what her dna test says. she was born in egypt. the egyptians are all over it. nothing will happen but  they are pissed.
@mahatma1989  educate yourself dear.
