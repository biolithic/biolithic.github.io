any video where melonie gets to flex her croftology degree and talk about tomb raider  even a spiritual successor  is a solid video in my book
this has  fuck you! i ll do it myself!  levels of energy and i fully support them! if crystal dynamics is to inept or unwilling to give us that classic tr feel we will slowly but surely just do it ourselves via indies!
the red hair combined with all the dino action gives me more dino crisis vibes than tomb raider  but i can see the crossover. hope it turns out well!also  take your time getting back to a normal schedule. we ll be here.
primal omen seems more like a love letter to dino crisis than tomb raider  what with the redhead fighting dinosaurs and all. which of course is a series capcom has been inexcusably sleeping on for the last 10 years. and it s especially confusing considering there s been 3 jurassic world movies they could ve capitalized on easily. but i can definitely see where the tomb raider influences lie  especially since tr had horror elements as well as you mentioned. not to mention the outfit.
it s good to see that there are many indies that are inspired by the old school of games and wants to make spiritual sequels or spin-offs to those games. it s game-developer warming
remember that handstand she used to do when she was climbing up a ledge  i did it every chance i got. i was bummed out that they didn t incorporate that in the 2013 reboot.
always a good day when melonie uploads a new video.
i want to see what climbing mechanics it has.  there s plenty of games with shooting.  but few games have interesting climbing.  what they need to bring back are pressure sensitive buttons.  without them games must have automatic grab points.
primal omen is a indie dino crises and not a tomb raider. the footage they showed in some spots is almost exactly like the events of dino crises 1 and 2. they even gave the female protagonist red hair like regina has. as a long time dino crises fan i m excited for primal omen. hopefully someone will make an indie tomb raider style game as well
looks cool. i kept thinking turok haha. good to see indie studios going toe to toe with the big guys. we need that. big studios with executives don t make good games
that damn running cartwheel jump across cliffs still haunts me to this day.  i miss old lara and the challenges of the older games
indie devs are getting the job done. i love what they re bringing to the table when aaa developers aren t doing it.also  the dog.  d
i love the lara flex. i know you aren t a fan of the reboot  but im kind of glad that i played them because it was made me a full fledged tom raider fan but hearing you talk about the originals so passionately made me want to give the originals a go. i already bought the first game and can t wait to get started!
i remember coming across the bear for the bear for the first time in tr1 and was like aww shit. and then there was the t-rex... had to build the courage to go out and fight it.this game def has dino crisis vibes.
the lara i remember was extremely athletic. she was practically a gymnast  which necessitates and kind of justifies her superior physique in some way. my memory is pretty hazy on tomb raider  but wasn t she able to do front flips and back flips and side flips and butt flips and boob flips and flips while swinging on poles and some kind of handstand flip after climbing to the tops of ledges
so glad you covered this! heading to pax on friday and will have to check it out...despite pax still requiring masks  no joke
i wishlisted this so fast. i got some dino crisis and jurassic park vibes along with a touch of tomb raider... i love it! she reminded me very quickly of regina from dino crisis in a way.
nothing compares to the original lara croft! original lara is the best! i don t like the dinosaurs though! also you look amazing today! great video melonie!
diegetic   di-a-jet-ik  refers to in-scene sound effects the characters can hear  creaking doors  footsteps on hard floors  cocking guns  etc.
how do so many beloved franchises get handed to a company that despises it i m looking at you  343 industries.
croftology i like that lol
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle
croftology  lmao
croftology  nice
for real!
too bad that dog was constantly  photo-bombing   and being one hell of a cute distraction.
croftology has been added to my vocabulary. you sir are a gentleman and a scholar  and you have my thanks.
she s a dedicated croftologist.
melonie is a tomb raider scholar.
game looks more like dino crisis then tombraider but whatever.
does anyone else now want to see  fuck you  i ll do it myself!  on t-shirts and coffee mugs  i mean  it s practically a fanboy call to arms.
@fenris30  because it has dino s in it dino crisis was a ressie-evil style survival horror game with tank controls and fixed cameras  just with dino s instead of zombies. this looks nothing like that. you re just seeing dino s and saying dino crisis because you remeber that game had dino s in it.this looks more like a mix between tr and trespasser.
@norman readdis  sounded to me like she only play the first new tombraider and none of the others with the more battle hardened lara. in later games she doesn t whine  she gets shit done. the first game honed her into a merciless killing machine who ll happily turn your ass into a pincushion if you cross her. you almost feel sorry for the bad guys. half the time i m like  dude just walk away  no fuck that run!   no don t taunt her she s just gonna leave you for last now and make your end extra painful.   oh you have a mini-gun...well like newt said  it won t make any difference.
@fenris30 as someone that played it. reboot lara is not actually and was never lara croft. she was way off and was a generic lead with an intersectional direction because she s created during the metoo times up rise. kinda like how marvel legacy have more meaning to them than its other new  variants . this new  lara  was never a tomb raider but a tomb respecter. sometimes you don t need to experience something to know it s not it was meant to be. if you re aware of the industry nowadays most doa tittles didn t even need to be experienced to know it s bad.
yeah  i immediately thought of dino crisis as well.
dino crisis was my first thought  too.
trespasser. if you know  you know.
i was thinking the same thing! that s another series i d love to see return.
i was thinking turok.
@jerome allen  i can totally see that  too! it seems like the developers have a good appreciation for classic games.
apparently the tomb raider games have dinosaurs its kind of odd how skull islandish these types of adventure games get when they explore ancient ruins and then meet an extinct species from millions of years ago.
yeah  i thought that too.
why they don t remake dino crisis blows my mind. i loved that series  and i know i m not alone in wanting that game remade. i think it would be a success. probably never happen  but i can hope.
@hatebreeder81  i know  right  instant money by the buckets full right there  yet capcom seems completely oblivious to it.
way more than 10 years. dino crisis 3  the last game  is from 2003.
@hatebreeder81  i m sick and tired of remakes. no i didn t like re2   re3 remake either. i m sick of the modern reddit edginess where they remake re as a last of us walking dead type of game  when the originals were george romero   john woo influenced. at the same time  you can t trust modern capcom to do a good dino crisis 4.
@mr. sinjin-smyth  i meant 10 years within the time the jw movies have been made  but yeah you re right.
wouldn t be surprised if capcom suddenly release a remake of dino crisis. i remember some indie devs made a megaman clone  i forgot what the title was but not long after capcom released a new version of megaman. i m sure the remake is in the works just like what they did with the r.e franchise. it s just a matter of time.
@black water the game you re thinking of is mighty no. 9  a game that was so poorly received by fans that capcom pulled a reverse uno card and made a better mega man than the indie developers that thought that they could make a better mega man than capcom.
@crazy mcgee  yes that s it. i was following it s game development. i ended up not buying it due to poor reviews. lol. i don t think it was a coincedence capcom responded. i hope somone emulates megaman legends to threaten capcom and force them to revive the franchise. i loved that game! if they made a modern one and open world it s going to be one hell of an adventure! i m going to write a petition to them to revive it.
they took all gymnastic and athletic attributes from her. i mean they basically got rid of everything except the voice.
nu!lara can barely walk in a straight line before falling down a mudslide  impaling herself  and getting caught in a bear trap - let alone do handstands!
@max sommers  jesus christ all the newer cinematic games constantly do that. tomb raider  horizon  uncharted......etc    and when you re climbing there s always  always a fucking brick that falls or a pipe that breaks  or a ladder rung that pops off and the character loses grip for a second. it really loses any effect it might have had after the 150th time in a row.
turok was great
congratulations
it has to do with the fact that most of the indie devs are gamers themselves. the aaa gaming studios have been infiltrated by greedy non gaming big business execs that only care about money grabs.
the classics are so amazing! hope you enjoy! if you re playing on pc i suggest you might want to use a third party software like joy2key to map the controls on a pad instead of keyboard. depends on preference  but i personally do not like keyboard controls on classic tomb raider  but then again i started playing on psone so maybe that is why haha
@melonie mac go boom  lmso good to know. good thing i already have one  epic game just sucks for controllers lol . i ll give the keyboard a try  but we all know platformers are better with controllers xd. thanks again!
@dart maciel  are you playing the game on steam  you should be able to use their controller configuration tool on the game instead of needing joy2key. this doesn t seem to work in all titles without workarounds  but it did in the first game. the controls will take some getting used to and i would say they are the biggest barrier to entry for newer players. if you are a purist on the graphics you can leave it as is but there are also some mods out there that allow more customization on things like resolution. the only other tip i have is to save and save often. forgetting to save and losing progress got me away from the series for a while.
@cerebrum  i dont care for graphics. i mean triangle boob lara is pretty funny lol. and yeah i heard that from other people to always save in tomb raider.
@dart maciel  i m not recommending the mods so much to make the game have updated models or anything. the resolution is set so low that depending on the screen you might have a hard time seeing it right. huge sections of the screen are empty  the text is on the blurry side  and some other issues. some people prefer to have the original 600x400 with a crt filter to make it look as much like the original would have as possible. others just want to not be irritated with the black bars and blurry text. later games in the series let you pick more resolution options so you can find what works best for your monitor and personal taste.
i mean you have to get used to the graphics and being accountable for your actions meaning pressing several buttons at the same time in the correct moment. but story wise  athmosphere wise  puzzle wise  character wise they are all superior. it is wise to go chronoligical though especial with 1 2 and 3 because difficulty wise they build up on each other.
@cerebrum  cool thanks for the tips. are they found on nexus
oh man i hope you enjoy it  if i was going i would be playing!if you get a chance to talk to the dev and you don t mind  tell him i m rooting for his game s success!
@melonie mac go boom will do!
you re the best andrew  thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  no  you re the best! and you re most welcome!
dude when does she not look amazing
honestly!
@end antifas  doesn t mean she doesn t appreciate hearing it.
sucks to see it
343i did a great with the master chief collection. credit where credit is due.
@allie-rx  not great but decent after 5 years of bugs. it s still not great but the content they re rolling out isn t half bad. halo infinite s new update is a step in the right direction
tomb raider infinite
the fan made tomb raider 2 on unreal looks amazing  would love to see that become a full game of it.china  venice  oil rig  40 fathoms  this still gives me water ptsd   maria doria  tibet monastery  beyond the door in china  the dragon realm and the assault on croft manor. its been 20 years since i last played tr2 and still my favorite game.i always assumed original lara wore a onepeice swimsuit with shorts over the top.
for an indie game this look pretty good. i m a huge indie gamer and i think this is gonna be a good addition to my collection. i ve already added it to my watchlist.
i had no idea this game existed. just wish listed it on steam. from one classic tomb raider fan to another  thank you!
congratulations on the spiritual successor competitor. meanwhile  i m hoping for somebody to make a spiritual successor to halo 3 halo reach. or i could just say  feck it  and make my own.
fine...i ll do it myself. seems to be the theme for this decade.
we ll still be here when you re ready to stream again. i m praying for all you re going through. you ll get through this and be even stronger
dude  im so glad you talked about how watered down  cut sceney and hand-heldy the latest tr games are. it takes away the agency of the player. i had to stop playing the first of the remakes of tr  cos it was just awful. there is literally no reason for it either in this day and age - if a player is really stuck they can watch yt playthroughs to see how to get past a point or how to solve a puzzle.in tr2 i got stuck on that opera house level for 2 hours  but when i finally figured out where to go it was so rewarding!
we need more dreamworks like companies making more content that other larger companies desdain.
do what you have to do  we will be waiting patiently! you being in a good place is most important! prayers up
all signs so far with this title  from the gameplay  setting  red head female lead  and even the title  seem to point more to dino crisis than to tomb raider. if the dev can add that acrobatic platforming traversal then we can really start delving into the tomb raider comparisons. fingers crossed
be safe and take care  dear melonie hopefully all will be sorted out soon enough  remember everything happens for the best  always!thank you for all you do
you re looking forward to a new tomb raider  meanwhile my reaction while watching that trailer is  sweet  a new dino crisis!!
my biggest gripe with latest tr games was the lack of pulpy lara and the fact they couldn t figure out how to give her two pistols. like seriously  how could you not figure that out !
melanie  if you were a fan of dinosaurs and monsters  what was your opinion of the dino crisis or turok franchises back in the day  or did you have much experience with them
i think it would be a good idea if someone else made the tomb raider games
interesting     i do love starting the week with your videos.hope your day is going great  melonie. you look fantastic
all the best! game is looking cool! i agree  her gear could use work. nice take on this. was hoping you would be able to join the conan exiles get together but of course take care of yourself
finishing the original tomb raider game was a proud achievement.  a beautiful challenging game it was.
i remember when the original game came out  on several occasions i was up all night trying to figure out something  no easy youtube walk through back then  only to call in sick the next day because i was totally incapable of functioning. good times.as for the game  rather than lara i m seeing regina from dino crisis.
11 28 - awesome melonie moment live and direct. puts a smile on your face
amen and amen!
amen .
i feel the same. new lara likes to verbally walk you through the puzzles too much. like  she s solving them  not us.
you re the best  rator. thank you so much
hopefully this game does come out on consoles  it looks really cool. and i ll be honest the whole time i watched the trailer i was singing  open the door get on the floor everybody kill the dinosaur  so that s a plus. another game i would recommend is syberia. i wouldn t really say it s tomb raider like  but it s a very puzzle filled  a bit dialogue heavy  but not bad. also i hope everything goes well with the stalker situation you re going through. i m not going to lie  it kind of makes angry the stalker is still giving you trouble  but i pray the lord keeps you safe and helps you get through this. just keep trusting in jesus and put it in his hands. the lord will take care of you.
if you like dino games with exploration elments  these upcoming games are what you want to look forward to  deathground  instinction  project ferocious and the lost wild!
i had a great time with dino crisis. this is one i have to keep an eye on. it feels like tr and dc combined  and im good with that.
lately  indies do actually do it better. lots of projects done with passion that show some weaknesses and kinks as you could expect from amateurs  but otherwise innovative  original and with impeccable mechanics. one such example is deep rock galactic. as far as super hits go let s not forget among us  or just vampire survivors. simple  maybe. but as far as the word game goes  indie is where the true gaming is.ps  i agree  all hail red hair.
i do believe we need an iron-age version in games  the same way we creators taking back the responsibility to make great comics and books  we also need to see developers making the games big studios refuse to make.
that looks really cool! thanks for the info on this. i hadn t heard of it.
i know people are fed up of remakes  but i think tomb raider 1-3 are all deserving of a resi 2 style remake. such great games. i ll always remember seeing the t-rex come out of the low draw distance as i crapped my pants and panicked till i found that little cubby area to hide in and being scared to come back out again.
she reminds me of a mix between lara croft and regina from dino crisis. gosh  a new dino crisis would be cool. there are so many dormant series that i think would thrive if put into a competent devs  hands and released today.
i m going to pax east and looking forward to playing the demo now!  hope there is no long lines for this
i could at least live with the legend   underworld era of tomb raider.  far more than i can with the modern era of tomb raider.   i didn t mind legend and underworld  myself.  i still prefer the ogs  but they were at least inoffensive  unlike the bile we get today.mel  looking cute without makeup.   poor doggo in the back  looked like it was frantic for moment.
with regard to what you said about the handholding  i m playing shadow for the 1st time  and i think you can turn off all the hints if you want to. not that this makes this any better than the classics  but there s that.
i hope lot s of modern games get great competitors that can outshine them  since they re all going kind of woke now.  i know pokemon is getting a lot of competitors now  and i hope tomb raider gets a good competitor too.
hello malonie. i m a boy from argentina  i like the classic tomb raiders and the saga in general  not counting the prostitution i suffered with the last installments  being the trans copy of uncharted   in fact  i recently bought the ps1  in argentina at consoles are called the play  or xbox on the other side  so you don t get confused   with the original tomb raider trilogy. but  i m really such a fan that  back in 2020  i started writing a piece  which became a novel  inspired by tomb raider  the title of the novel is   the calls of adventures   it s about an archeology argentinian  called lara  yes  i lacked originality a bit  but at least it s not a fan-fiction   who travels from argentina  specifically from her province and the city  to london  a reference  and from there  with his father  who is an archaeologist  he teaches her and they discover the true history of the earth  which is an altered version of mine about the facts  it has to do with my tastes in terror and cosmic horror  and after a year with months  exactly two  i was able to finish it  managing to have a novel of 1680 pages in total  the novel is on wattpad  obviously in spanish  and with the accent that characterizes us argentines   in case you re interested in learning about the idea.here i leave the link  sorry for the slight spam   in case  with the help of the translator  you are interested  https   www.wattpad.com user escritorvillano
the t. rex breaking through the window reminds me of the scene from dino crisis. also  did anyone else see a reticule or is that part of the minimal hud
we love you  so stay happy as you fight the good fight! re gameplay - i liked the camera and gameplay in the first 2 or 3 tr games. camera should look where the character is looking.- the preview seemed to be too close behind her though - back off a bit so we see more context and we see the entire character.- put in lots of puzzles.- set pieces should be minimal and short  just to connect one game sequence to the next.- we should be alerted to timed sequences - maybe a clock in the cornet of the screen - game should be saveable and pausable anywhere  not just at fixed places. phonecalls - let the character choose her outfit from a big wardrobe. include all the options males would like to see!- have at least 3 gameplay settings  easy  normal  and hard.
great video melonie!  and  yes  take the time to take good care of you! god bless.
the games went two ways after the doom keycard plot became the standard. tomb raider was about solving puzzles and discovering moves  like the laser disc game dragon s lair. dino crysis and other games focused more on clearing levels and reaching checkpoints. ammo conservation was an important part of both. the environments were a major part of what interested people  why crytek did so well with far cry.
while not exactly the same genre have you considered looking at ghostrunner if you want that acrobatic traversal hit that focuses on high skill play
now this is a video game clone i can get excited about!and nice simpcast shirt.
i always enjoy the random puppy cameos.ps1 is retro....i feel so old.
4 20 honestly... when i google  lara croft through the years  for a refresher  i like the 4th images shorts look and first reboot game the most costume wise the most  for character model i tend to like fan creations far more than what studios make  somewhere around i think a half way between angle of darkness and modern reboot face with a body thats a half way between the ps1 games and modern.
i hope they have third person view options.  i haven t played an over the shoulder game yet and the view drives me bonkers.
this game has potential. if it ever comes out. i m more than old school tomb raider.  thanx for giving us the update on tomb raider .  what s her link so i can check it out. great video. i liked playing the first four games and even tomb raider chronicles. i ve been a huge fan of tomb raider. i even got the comic books. when they came out.
dinosaurs are pretty cool in almost everything they re in...and yeah i think i just thought of a few things where  cool  isn t exactly the right word to use  a big purple dinosaur just invaded my mind  ugh .  this game does look fun though for sure!!!
i ll never forget the first time that t-rex appeared in the first game. scared the shit out of me.
this is a wonderful time for independent game developers to use generative ai to create games that people will actually want to play! these large companies can take a hike. there will be no more catering to audiences when ai video and ai game development takes the front row and center stage.
oh this game is giving me that dino crisis vibes and i m all for it.
i love your tomb raider videos and in my opinion i think we need a remastered on the classic tomb raider games and i hope it happens
it s definitely a mesh of tomb raider and dino crisis  love it already
i am a big fan of tr 1 - 5  yes  even chronicles . aod was the last retail game i played. since then i ve watched others playing the recent games on youtube. she has devolved into a throat-slashing killer. not a fan of gore. i keep my tr craving satisfied with the thousands of custom levels available.
this feels a lot more like a  dino crisis on re engine  remake  specifically with the red-hair  regina  but if the dev s main outlook is a classic legend tr fusion   i m here for it!
this video game is the equivalent of a 3-0 fastball down the middle and the 3rd base coach has given melonie the sign to swing for the fences  and the left field fans put down their peanuts  crackerjacks and beer and positioning themselves to catch the home run. another home run is melonie s fresh makeup look this video
have you ever considered reviewing  scars above . it looks like it takes some aspects of tomb raider and is definitely similar to this game but already released.
this looks interesting to me  but for a totally different reason. it reminds me more of dino crisis  from the title to the heroine with the red hair  but gameplay-wise more in the style of the resident evil 2 remake  something i ve been hoping capcom would make.
i really liked  angelina jolie as tomb raider   shes perfect and  i think shes the real lara croft  that being said  i really i loved the last 3 games of the tomb raider  especially  shadow of the tomb raider  they made me fall in love with a  lara croft  and the visuals and music dear god  3 im definitely waiting for a new lara adventure.   i grew up in the ps1 era   but lara croft wasn t on my game list back then  i tried playing the oldschool games after finishing the newest trilogy but the controllers just felt a bit clunky  so i haven t finished any of those   sorry      haha    i dig the dinosaurs too  cheers from mexico b
thanks to unreal engine 5  now everyone can make a very good looking game  it still requires tons of time and everything  but now is possible compared to the past  so full studios should be aware  because eventually indies might be more massive and get better material than game devs  some already have done this  but mostly with 2d games   this trend already started with indie films  they are getting better movies than the full studios  because indies create things with love  and studios nowadays create things to just try to make everyone happy  and not so much in real quality or putting the best. best
my dream since tomb raider 2013 is to make a game like the classic tomb raider games coz tomb raider isn t tomb raider anymore but this!! i can t say anything but thank you for giving us a hope
hey melanie. dino crisis is the game capcom made that was like resident evil but with dinosaurs. this game seems like a mix of modern tomb raider and dino crisis. look it up. that game also had a bad ass female protagonist.
if they just want to watch cutscenes they could easily watch a yt video of the cutscenes for any game.  i ve done that for games i m interested in and games i don t care about.  the red hair reminds me of regina from dino crisis 1 or 2 which makes me intrigued .  i get more dino crisis vibes than tomb raider vibes though  and i really hope the character has different outfits  you can change into  like in the dino crisis games.
8 05 this game is clearly meant to be more of a tribute to dino crisis  red head female protagonist  dinosaurs  survival horror  investigating an island...
4 54 you probably know better than me and a quick google search  but wasnt tomb raider a very small team  google says 6 people for the first one.
a good example is a free game on steam called deathly stillness. it s made by a guy who teaches game development. he wanted to show his students how easy it is make a video game  so he made one by himself. he even still updates it  all for free. it s a pretty cool game too.
we understand your hands are full  we re supporting you and willing to wait however long it takes for real life to be handled. great lara croft content as always  but keep your head up and kick that case where the sun don t shine.
wouldn t it be cool if one of these game companies would let you assemble your characters outfit
i want to see a game starring melonie. we can call it sarcophagus thief or mausoleum plunderer or something. cemetery bandit.
seems like the game devs are starting to hears you. maybe next we will see nintendo buy the franchise and restore it back to how it originally was  or something very close. but it s cool to see you excited for this.
i ve never played a tomb raider game but i love listening to you rant about it lol
i like how this game reminds me of jurassic park  trespasser  but they should ve used jurassic park dinos than making their own incarnation.   because spitting dilophosaurs and human-sized velociraptors were jurassic park dinosaurs than rl.     though they did use the current model of t-rex  minus feathers   which i ll give props.
i use to love getting stuck in classic tr games and having to think about how to solve puzzles. i ve played and beat all of the classics  but have only played the first of the newer games. after that one i m just not interested in playing any of the others ones.
cute pup. what s their name i can never get into mimic brands when the original brand i loved falls. it s like dating another girl that has so much that reminds you about an ex you really cared about.
this makes me want a dino crisis remake that much more.
i have 3 questions for you. 1 which do you like better 1st person or 3rd person. 2 when is primal omen going to be released. and 3 will it be for ps5 because that s what i have a ps4 and ps5.
i would like to play this. looks fun. definitely lara vibes
i feel the same way the pup feels when i clean out my ears too... total relief lol
i always get a good laugh in videos where there are animals in the background doing their thing. haha
glad to see smiles  but anything a woke company makes we can do it better
if melonie can find an excuse to get lara croft in her videos  she will. you look very good today  melonie. the game does look interesting . lara croft meets jurassic park. keeping you in my prayers  melonie
it is so great and wonderful to listen to you melonie to talk about your favorite role model of video game character lara croft and tomb raider video games. anyway i just wanted to let you know that and i just want to tell you that tomb raider is a great video game ever and it is not a competitor video game and it is a survival video game that helps you to get through the game by surviving the levels and get through the challenges that waits you through the game  ok melonie. anyway that s what it is all bout with the whole tomb raider video games is how to survive the game  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great day today and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also i am praying for you that you can come back to do more steaming shows on twitch this week or this month and beyond in future  ok melonie. anyway have a great evening and good nite melonie. god bless you too.
tomb raider 2 and 4 was so good.  what i d give to play something like that again.
my oldest daughter  what is shown so far. tomb raider   dinosaurs is a win for her
this not looks like tomb raider but also similar to uncharted im def wanna keep an eye on this game btw thanks for the video melonie
and the wait will be worth it. you do what you need to do. we ll be here ready. praying for ya always
well said  bats!
you re amazing  thank you
@melonie mac go boom  you re welcome  i know you re strong!
@otterloopb  thanks!  d
the only problem is that this game looks nothing like a tomb raider game. it s more of a dino crisis spiritual successor. there s a dodge  but that s it. the rest is just walking and shooting. there s no jumping or flipping or climbing. i feel like melonie got excited about this without really making some actual comparisons. she really wants a female protagonist to be like lara croft. this ain t it though.

8 38 i agree because my only experience with tomb raider was 4 year old me popping in the jam pack disc  opening the tomb raider 2 demo  and hitting the reset button as soon as i saw the tiger.
at one time tomb raider was new. it is just common for things to start to smell after a well. so you start with something new. it could even be a new genre or medium that is promising.
i heard on reddit. that guy shaun is finally going to sue mel for defamation of character  . i guess he s got a legitimate case haha stay tuned folks!
if we are going down the dino route  i would love for a new turok
always good to see melonie. and i find this interesting
compared to the first tr games... seems good enough for the first  will check it out.
kind of wish it would be more exploration and puzzle solving aspects though
this game is more dino crisis then anything else and that s a win in my book.
two times when i was younger a lot younger actually that i was genuinely scared in a video game one was the t-rex in the laura croft tomb raider game and second was in resident evil when those dogs came through the wall and that spider thing or whatever it was that came through the ceiling and then as an older adult there was a spot in dead space that scared the s    out of me
you are an awesome girl melonie.
that dog wasn t having it man. little fur dude went wild.
this looks really good for  just an indie game .
i was thinking to myself about a year ago  wouldn t be great if capcom used their new graphics from resident evil remakes and made a dino crisis remake series too! it would be great.  now  with primal omen game its one step forward to that. this game is a dino crisis with old fashion tomb raider s gameplay  with an acceptable indie graphics  if you compared to the old tomb raider graphics games  its definitely acceptable. got to play the demo of this game. i think when you pick an old game classic and try to make a remake of it  don t do it with retro graphics  like pixelart  minecraft-ish or ps1 style   but with real top notch unreal engine 4-5 kind of graphics  for best aaa feel. another one i would like to see is american mcgee s s alice 3  alice asylum is the current name of the project concept  this game is now in standby because the creators are trying a crowdfunding with ea games to get a partnership with another devs company.
i m sure you ve been asked this before but  i m curious. have you played the horizon games  if so  do you have a video about it  would love to hear your take.
reminds me more of dino crisis than it does tomb raider.
when will it be acailable  i m stoked!
it feels like resident evil but with dinosaurs instead of zombies.
added to my steam wishlist. dinos and ginger mc convince me. hoping for a good level of difficulty
0 29 our australia labradoodle do the exact same thing when we clean her earsand in winter get paws get a little dry so we got a balm to prevent any problems but she hate it and go full taz   when we put it on
would be cool of the dev to throw in a classic tomb raider inspired optional outfit.
well see i want it all..i want the classic gaming fun and the beautiful graphics and cut scenes.
i m currently playing tr2 and it makes me so sad that lara croft doesnt exist anymore but man was she cool as hell!!!!!
i am going to keep an eye on this game. it definitely has a dino crisis vibe to it. unfortunately capcom is too focused on remaking resident evil games to do anything with that series. just finding a decent dinosaur game in itself is hard to come by. most have forced multiplayer which ruins any horror aspect to it. just makes them action games.
omg that comment on your dog s ears at the beginning of the video is just so funny because i just kept looking at the dog
me and my brother would stay up late playing tomb raider 1   2!
if i could get my collectors addition to actually run on my pc  i would play the old tomb raider again. miss that feeling.
it reminds me more of dino crisis so i am interested.
the entertainment industry is in such a sad state. we re having to get excited over  knock-off  products because the  og  franchises are being intentionally taken in such an unappealing direction.
love that little fluffy guy runnin around behind you lol!
awww your little fluffball woofwoof is so cute!! !!!!  that indi game looks awesome! i m all for fan made and indie tomb raiders  at least we ll be getting what we the real fans want  not what the wokey whiners want haha
my guess is that potential copyright issues are why they don t make this full-on tomb raider
well ok she s cleaning her ears but alicia s and dragging her blood across the carpet this time
in torn about the t-rex. they ve gone for what s currently considered the most scientifically accurate look and proportions but it looks goofier
i was annoyed with the clues lara gave as well and the white path laid out.. i figured it out a bit late  but it all can be turned off.
game design 101.  if you re trying to maximize profit  you have to write a game to your least common denominator.  the least common denominator aren t really people that like puzzles and hard challenges.  indies are in fact where you will start to see this re emerge.
oh nice.  that will go on my wish list.
i m getting big dino crisis vibes here  you should really check out those games if you haven t  at least the first two  the third one kinda jumped the shark  haha .
i want her to jump and flip around like a crazy gymnast pro shooting dinosaur s with her dual pistol like in classic lara croft
classic tomb raider meets dino crisis  this looks like it could be fun!
i d get it just for the nostalgia factor if nothing else. i never even pretended to play the new ones cause everyone told me they were horrible.
as mobile enjoyer i really like lara croft  guandian of the light  it is pretty good and basically gone from playstore.
this looks really cool. the last 3 tomb raiders were just far cry   hunger games mixes.
a beautiful red-head.an isolated island.overrun with dinos.sounds like dino crisis to me. the remake we are waiting for.
it s such a girl thing to care solely about looks. i love new lara for the simple fact that she s a goddamned terminator. i swear that between the three games that i must have taken out the total population of a small country both silently and increasingly brutal ways. this lara does not fuck around  she will end your ass if you give her reason to. no talking  no witty banter  just blam! she ll just kill your ass and keep on keeping on. she s the epitome of nah son  i m not trapped here with you  your trapped her with me . she... scratches an itch. the games also challenge my grey matter inbetween bouts of me merking mooks like ghostface with their increasingly intricate puzzle tombs. she also controls like a dream and could easily give leon a run for his money in the controlling the flow of battle department. i love the new games and routinely play them  just like i return to all the other tomb raider games but like with legacy i return the first one way more then the others. the first games just have less fluff to deal with and more pre.. i mean npc attackers.
if only there were an actual jurassic park game that looks like this instead of just another park builder game  i really just want a survival horror jp game.
after the explanation for the dog  i couldn t stop watching the dog in the background
jurassic park meets lara croft i m digging it
the tr remakes were hardly easy  at least on the difficulty setting i choose to play on.
tomb raider meets dino crisis. love it!
better then the aaa game right now.
i know dead space isn t as old  but the way melonie feels about the classic tomb raider games is the sameway i feel about dead space 2008   dead space remake  they did hammond so wrong under the surface . that  modern audience  nonsense  and wokeness  exist plentiful in it too.
i only have the 4 ps1 titles. im not a big fan but want to get into them. are any of them good beyond ps1
this game looks like it s right out of the late 90 s....and i mean that in both the good and bad  ways
what a great monday treat! cheers.
this gives me more vibes from dino crisis than tomb raider. even the red hair feels more like a reference to the protagonist of dino crisis  regina.
to be fair  a single pistol is more practical.  there was a mythbusters episode  where they showed how using two pistols actually hampers your aim and ability to focus.  i ve tried it myself too  playing games like lethal enforcers and house of the dead - not the best kind of gaming experience.
if i made games i d have the regular difficulties easy medium and hard and another one called modern audience and that mode would just have all the cut scenes playing back to back lol
love the puppy just walking back inforth in the background lol
new melonie mac video  how have u been sis great to c u
tomb raider   jurassic park   resident evil   dino crisis   i need a pc asap!
i bought dead space on gog about a few days before the announcement of the remake. so  i instantly regretted my gog purchase. over time  though  i ve come to feel as if i did the right thing. i have the original dead space game  and i m not touching the remake.
since when was original tomb raider about being  practical  though
even though i enjoyed some of the newer games i understand why classic fans wouldn t. if i had gotten to play them back then i probably would feel the same way. despite what i did enjoy from the new series i do feel they never developed her into the character she was in the old games. if they had done that by the end of the first game in the reboot i think it would be better received. primal omen looks a bit more like dino crisis than tomb raider to me. i d still love a new dino crisis game but i doubt capcom is bringing that back anytime soon.
youre gonna have to do that whole intro again i cant pay attention to it with the dog being crazy cute
looks like  turok   combined with  tomb raider   mixed with a bit of  resident evil . looks interesting.
i m picking up on more of a dino crisis vibe here  than i am tomb raider tbh.
the main difference between catwoman and lara croft is that lara robs dead people while catwoman robs jewelry stores. and catwoman does for riches and for money while lara does it for sport. so catwoman can also be considered another competitor to tomb raider. oh  and catwoman isn t rich like lara croft and lara doesn t dress up like a cat. but they both have a lot of similarities. both femme fatales.
aw  the fact that the creator follows melonie is sweet  and her reaction to that was sweet.
@melonie mac go boom  nope  not indies  indiana jones  does it better xd  actually i would love to see what you think of past indiana jones games  they are tomb raider clones  i had lots of fun with them  its a shame they are pc only games.  theirs a new indiana jones game coming out soon and i hope they dont mess that up.
i think we can all agree that wildeerstudio and pixiewillow should be heavily involved in any new tombraider game   p
scars might be something to look into as well.
i think the red hair is more of a nod to regina from dino crisis considering the heavy emphasis on dinosaurs.
since i don t do melonie s  annual   replays  i forgot tomb raider games used to be hard.
looks very  asset store.  promising start  but will take a lot more work.
this is basically tomb raider meets turok  dinosaur hunter.
me trying to concentrate on the content   doggo! ...... doggo shaking!  edit   doggo!
let s add tomb raider to the list of games i need to play when i eventually get around to getting an emulator
it looks like it will be very cool  game
looks like they combined lara croft tomb raider and regina dino crisis.
i think i m going to clean up and play some tomb raider today. i keep getting drunk and posting crap on twitter and being like i don t remember that or what was i thinking. kinda dropped the ball on that one. i didn t know resident evil 4 remake was coming out i ve played the remake of 1 and 2. i didn t know there s puzzles in tomb raider. i really like the puzzles. that one in code veronica with the pictures took me forever. looking good today. sorry about the crap i posted on your twitter. i don t think you re bothered that much but that s not me and it s embarrassing. i m looking forward to just getting things cleaned up and playing tomb raider tonight. that game is awesome.
redhead fighting dinosaurs  horror diped  hmm... looks like tomb raider meets dino crisis... f@    g love it !!!
i m not a fan of the  much  more difficult games  but whatever  that just means it s not for me and that s fine.  p  that s not to say i like the hold-handing of modern gaming... all i need is a tutorial then let me play the damn game. of course  whether or not this game is more difficult than i d enjoy is not something i d decide at this point. i ll wait and see. it looks good.
1 38 that goes double for those that beat aod...
it s like a mix between tomb raider and dino crises lol
so melonie finally played barbie explorer for the ps1. looking forward to this review...
it is a mix of tombraider and dino crisis. exactly melonie.
this game reminds me more of  dino crisis  than  tomb raider .
mel and tombraider are like breakfast and eggs
5 04 why was that so adorable
sometimes i wonder if the reason games are getting more and more woke is because the actual developers working on the games are woke.
truth is i think the old tomb raider games are only hard cuz of how bad the gfx are cuz i played and i couldnt see where to go  at all cuz everything just looked like the same in a way u could tell in some spots if it  was ground or a wall till u went to it and looked real close lol the old games just didnt cut it for me but the new ones i really dont care how she was before and dont care how she is now what the game needs is harder puzzles 100  they was just tiny tombs that didnt really do much
have you ever played dino crisis melanie  you d probably like that...especially part 2!
i ll be honest. i completely ignored you the entire time your dog was on screen. lol. looks like they were going for a tomb raider dino crisis type game. ha  and you just agreed. glad i m not alone.
dino crisis vibes right here mel!
this game looks very fun. i m not seeing any puzzles or tombs  tho. jurrasic survival horror 3rd person shooter works  tho
i m not going to lie  i was watching the dog come and go.
the super smash bros. new challenger logo approaches appears. also in case anyone hasn t told you today  which they most likely have  you re beautiful melonie.
seems like a third person turok dinosaur hunter. in tr the dinosaurs were a suprise discovery. this is a dino main game.
i love the little doggo.
would be weird if square buys the game  or sue s this company for character style infringement. i forgot which company did that
red hair  dinosaurs  what she s supposed to be the new dino crisis
the original tomb raider has more challenge in 10 minutes of play than the new ones have in 40 hours. it s astounding to see how extraordinarily easy games  movies  now are. i ve been playing dmc3  and... wow. current gaming has tamed us.there s now more innovation from indie or aa titles.primal omen looks pretty cool. jolly good topic  melonie mac.
for me looks like they re doing a dino crisis with post re4 mechanics.
it s pretty aaa to me  like high quality. maybe to make it more aaa it needs microtransactions.
looks like we re getting tomb raider   dino crisis.
this is a spiritual sequel to dino crisis.
it will be a good short indie game.
modern  audiences struggle with actual gameplay
puzzles. giant never before solved ancient puzzles hiding the secrets of man s origins and the existence of ancient gods. that s what i want.
she s a pro in croft-ology lol
aaa publishers are too obsessed with wokeness and live services. indies have been where it s at for years already.
it gives dino crisis vibes  seems nice
reminds me of turok on the n64.
i grew up when games were very hard because they were influenced by coin operated games that were deliberately hard to get your money. nes era had some very hard games. imagine today s participation trophy generation playing coin-op games. my guess is that without the tutorial hand holding and internet walkthroughs  we would have far less ppl playing video games.
this reminds me a lot of dino crisis
to be honest...... if i want to go fight dino s i go play ark.... would be awesome if it would have the puzzle solving part like tomb raider had
lara croft in dino crisis.
kwasade for the algorithm.  kwasade for the algorithm.
capcom used to have a dinosaur game similar to resident evil in the 90 s but haven t touched it at all anymore.
did you like  heavenly sword   melonie i figured you would have  enjoyed it.
i don t know anyone who could beat old school lara in a fight. i feel i could pin new lara fairly easily. she has had three games now and she is still inexperienced and whiny. how many games does she need to become the tomb raider
i m very worried about the legacy of kain series
yup  because they aren t gamers
and good character designs. they feel threatened by peak beauty especially peak female beauty. but sometimes also male handsomeness  too.
i came here to say the same thing.
yup  dino crisis
anything crystal dynamics touches is a trash fire
1 35  duh! they were not hard  just clunky. 1 54  on anniversary   i saw a trophy early on mansion  but only managed to get it at the ending of the game. and i didn t achieve 100 .
love classic tr and classic re
0 21 doggo cameo
this looks more like modern dino crisis to me   looks  fun though !
that actually kinda looks like ghost recon
looks like the og lara mixed with the new games graphics. could be good.
if i were in charge of this game  i would instruct all of the artists not to reference any jurassic park related media whatsoever during the entirety of the production and only reference prehistoric planet or the work of current paleo-artists. of course  i can t be certain that they know that dinosaurs were real animals  there were some people who didn t know that the titanic was a real ship  after all.
this feels more dino crisis than tomb raider
i know  i m not allowed to complain about it  since i only played the remake of the first game  but...i always hated it  that you already got dinosaurs in the first levelnothing against dinosaurs  but why the first level already they should give us dinosaurs in the later levels and don t get me started about the gorillas in the greek-level also  looks more like a spiritual successor of dino crisis to metrespasser might also has a huge influence in that game
i guess it s not much lara croft but dino crisis influenced.  -  even deep red hair is from dino crisis character.  -
but also let s wait for the game to actually come out before we criticize rather or not it s capable of competing with games made by big corporations this is a early look not the final product and i have seen indie games that easily surpassed a lot of mainstream games because they don t have politics they didn t have too many chefs working on the same project it seems like everybody had the same simple vision and storm straight ahead with it
the best non tomb raider tomb raider game i ve played lately  is praey for the gods. it scratched my classic tomb raider itch with it s exploration  puzzles and search for hidden items gameplay.
reminds me of dino crisis meets turok meets perfect dark meets tomb raider
if you re a kid gaming in the 90s  finishing tomb raider games is just a stroll vin the part for you. if you re this generation of  gamers  you will feel like a games journalist playing the retro games.
so basically this is tomb raider meets dino crisis okay i m down with that i can dig it
dinosaurs  jungle  female laracroftish protag  smells like dinocrisis haha i loved that game
as a  movie guy  i must say that indie films are often more innovative because they are free from corporate  major studio bs. it wouldn t surprise me if it s the same with video games.
kind of reminds me of turok meets lara croft.
looks neat.
dood luck with your  problem .  i m trying to be polite.  we will be here when you have time. also remember to drink water. everyone have a wonderful day.
or just dino crisis with resident evil 4 control-schemeor trespasser in 3rd-person than 1st-personalso  was thinking about a turok-game  similar to far-cry primal since yearsi know  open-world is overdone  but that could work
@therealwinston  totally
thank you for reading of the computer game that was in my kindergarten classroom.pterodactyl nanosaur hatchling 2  question can you find it and play it please.as far as i know it s only available on pc.on youtube please.
yeah  i mean i can see why these modern audience detest lara she s an actual woman whose accomplished  intelligent and hard working.
this is now on my radar. hot grrls and dinos! bring it
more like dino crisis  which should have a remake with capcoms re engine . but that said it s definitely a better looking lara craft type character.
looks like fun
i just watched the trailer and i like this many times better than anything that has been branded lara croft in recent history. i can just see how the woke warriors are going to attack it and demand it be banned or try and shame anyone who plays it. these series destroying studios just aren t going to get this until they all become the next silicon valley bank.
i stopped playing games from this era all together. that harry potter game is the first that caught my eye and somebody told me about elden ring. tombraider is so iconic. i remember the first three very well. i vividly renner the house with secrets spaces in it and the butler. skyrim and fall out were the last games i played. the political messaging  in app purchases and exploitation in the gaming industry isn t getting my vote. older games have so much more passion in development which you see in the game. it now has become a money grabbing game. in remember half-life days. that game was epic  wel developed.
looks like someone got tired of waiting for capcom to remake dino crisis and just started making it themselves
if you can t game or don t want to game instead of complaining just watch a playthrough. it saves time and money and i am sure there is a gamer out there that will play in a way that won t annoy you to badly.
it s kinda like dino crisis meets tomb raider
what is the best tomb raider game  i only ever played the 2013 series which i thought was alright.
clean ears is the best feeling in the world.
lara got sent to site b between jurassic park 3 and jurassic world.
i m favoriting your video just because of the doggie.
classic lara croft is the goat
looks like your dog s having trouble rebooting. my bro says that the future is indie. mostly because the people who make these games are fans of the franchise themselves and second they are only one or a few people so they can t be flippant with what they create  not that they want to be. primal omen seems to be more tomb raider meets dino crisis i believe.
doubt you d get away with twin pistols without copyright sniffing around tbh  need enough differences to establish it as your own ip  the dual pistols on that kinda look would scream lara croft too much to be safe i reckon.
mel has a fuzzy potato wandering around in the background.
the current tomb raider games are really good you can turn up the difficulty and lara won t give you hints the combat is harder and you can turn off the survival instincts and glowing item nonsense.i just finished shadow of the tomb raider on deadly obsession difficulty and it was evil if you die there are no check points and you can t save the game like you could in the old games only the campfires save your game so you can get set back a hell of a lot.also i am a hardcore gamer i always pick the hardest difficulty and aim for 100  completion i love the old res evil  dino crisis and lara croft but i prefer new lara to original as og lara never seemed smart enough to solve the puzzle or studyed history and i never liked her look or personality i just liked the gameplay.
aww! your dog!!! so sweet  d  d
regarding the classics tomb raider 2 is the most popular with the fans.
indie games are the future.
oh  really no one has made a game with the classic tomb raider style of gameplay and puzzles yet  i feel the itch now
if i get a uzi shooting skateboarding menace that s a day one buy.
this game is clearly inspired by dinocrisis  melonie. not tomb raider.
this looks like it has the dino crises vibe
it looks ok. the dinosaur enemies are cool  that s it.
i remember playingturok that was good
is the title of this video what happens when player 2 presses the start button
looks like a mix of tomb raider and far cry 3 so could be fun
this looks more dino crisis than tomb raider
i wishhhh that they remade all the classic tomb raider games like capcom is remaking the resident evil games. i honestly just want to play them on ps5 so bad why cant they release the originals on ps5.
i still don t understand some peoples hate for the new games. it s not like the first ones were that much to write home about. legend was awesome and it got sequels too. sottr was the best hame in the series imo  even if it isn t classic lara. just be patient i m sure we ll get classic lara reboot soon enough. and both reboot and classic lara are beautiful  the classic one is just more unrealistic and more sexy going into adventures.
i agree! the modern tomb raider games may be pretty  but they lack challenge. qte and helpers and lara acting like a baby.
the end of mainstream gaming is nigh  melanie  i am glad to see that the indie scene is giving you what you want prayers going up for yougod bless you and everyone
this looks more like dino crisis than tomb raider
sounds like when bug fables came out with it basically saying  you don t want to make good paper mario games anymore fine  we ll do it ourselves.
your puppy is adorable!
the dog s ears are clean!!
as a pc gamer since dos  before windows i ll never own a console. playstation exclusives have been around for some time and i was always  curious . since many have finally been remastered released for pc on steam i ve been able to check out several titles from what have been considered the  best  sony has to offer. so as not to create any drama i ll just say most are very heavy cut scene filled and while looking pretty good  suffer from the limited hardware forcing developers to use the old  slowly squeeze thru  to give the system time to load the new assets. many ports do this regardless of origin and i don t want to play a movie  i want to play a game.
dino crisis meets tomb raider  gimme gimme
lara   regina   hnnng
trespasser ever heard of that game before
honestly  i think it s nostalgia. i ve played some of the originals  i never played them as a kid   and it s not really that great. that being said i thought the first game in the tomb raider reboot was amazing! rise of the tomb raider was also pretty good  i haven t played shadow though.
@mediagimmicks same here but trust me shadow is thebbest if the best  story atmosphere music graphics combat puzzles all 10 10
primal omen looks freaking awesome!!!
just give us a kill bill game since tarantino is screwing us outta part 3.
take care of you first! this madness that chose to visit you will soon be over! we aint going anywhere!  _  you ll be back! with a bigger boom than evar!
it is so sad  that in an age where everything is remastered  they will not do the first 4 tomb raider games    i m quite sure that it will be so easy money it hurts...despite all that woke stuff.  i wouldn t even mind a  normal  b-or c cup - if the size of a cup is the reason why people will be offended nowadays. i would pay for remastered standard last revelation game alone 150 easily and i m no gamer . to see lara in egypt ...
thanks for the stories
why don t you like legend timeline trilogy that much legend and anniversary are my 2 favourite tomb raider games  that i ve played   i ve played them all the time as a kid and i feel like they re really solid games  nostalgia aside.bought all the original timeline ones last year and i guess i ll see exactly what you re talking about.it s probably just nostalgia  you grew up on the original games  i ve grew up on legend trilogy.ps. lara croft is one of my favourite fictional chracters  i m neither a woman  nor do i fight dinosaurs or raid tombs  which proves that the main character doesn t have to be the exact mirror of myself in order for me to love him her. suck it woke people.
tbh  this looks more like a dino crisis faithful game than a tomb raider one. it has way more in common with dc by the trailer. the only thing it has in common with tomb raider is the protagonist look. which it does make sense if this is a dino crisis like game since fans were hard let down with exo primal
hey simpcast shirt!!!
the original tomb raider series needs to be graphically updated and rereleased as remastering
so tomb raider would be back very soon  i wonder.
besides the obvious bits of inspiration  this seems less tomb raider and more dino crisis.this is  by no means  a bad thing. dino crisis is great. need more dino horror.
excuse me  lara is a sexist trope classic lara is one of the fiercest and strongest women in video game history! i literally learned how to swim a kayak when i was 14 from looking at her. get it  a video game character taught me how to use a vehicle  a simple one  but still . if that isn t a strong character  a non-existant  fairy tale woman teaching a teen boy a skill  then cheesecake is made out of moon rock.for petey s sake  i don t understand where  modern audiences  come up with such ideas...   also  that stalker still hasn t let go  stay strong  mel! don t get infected by negativity  you re waaay above what that poor chap is trying to orchestrate. hope he comes to his senses and gets on with his life.
she looks healthier than tomb raider as well
hold on a sec that s not tomb raider its dino crisis and i still love it.
this reminds me of dino crisis.
well  the game market has been craving for a dino crisis and better lara croft.
this looks more like dino crisis with the resident evil formula  over the shoulder gameplay
this looks more like dino crisis with lara as protag.
honestly this doesnt look like lara croft type game  more like a fan kind of remake reimagining of the very first dino crysis
makes me think of dino crisis
thank you so much
another amazing indie project tomb raider 2 remake  pc
i would take no tomb raider over this.
seems like a tomb raider dino crisis hybrid.
i can tell you re not really into this because you re seeking for a pure adventure game or adventure - action like the oldest titles  it did naturally develop more into action - adventure. pure adventure games are niche now. the over head look is like batman arkham series and other action games  that s sort of how combat developed to be portrayed in action games but going forward its becoming more like hogwarts legacy until gta6 revolutionizes the space once more  they always tend to  borrow from each other .
going to buy this game just to add some spice to this boring af world
understand where you are coming from  i spent hours trying to get artifact 7 in the manor level - time well spent frustrating as it was.i don t get the character being on the left edge  it s distracting.
well good to see they still have dinosaurs  3
dino crisis ish. i m in.
54 godzilla or the legendary. i feel about the legendary the way you feel about new tomb raider.
the doggo
i rather liked the new tomb raiders.  the last one strayed a bit far from my ideal.   too many side characters.   i prefer the loner laura stoically making it through danger to achieve a goal. the problem with fighting dinos is it has less  weight  than fighting humans. it s like fighting robots.  there s no emotional charge. i d rather they add a  lethal non-lethal  mode like mgs so laura could get the enemies out of the way without becoming a mass murderer.   the only thing that bothered me about the new tr was the body count. that didn t seem very realistic. times change. the kind of games i enjoyed 20 years ago  i probably wouldn t enjoy today. i doubt a resurrected old school tr would sell particularly well.
in the vein of this topic  the more traffic we drive toward alternative media  games  and entertainment  the more we can drain profits from the corporations that have been irredeemably infected with wokeism. to this end  please don t forget to upload your videos to rumble as well  especially with crowder back in the fight with his independent company. and don t forget that crowder is unabashedly christian conservative and would probably love an attractive gaming culture icon on his team  especially since he is also texas based  and i bet he would love the biggit army  lol. keep speaking truth  and we ll keep watching.
this game reminds me more of dino crisis than tomb raider.
with the except of the the last revelation  the tomb raider games weren t really that challenging...
nice simpcast tank!
looks great  but looks more of a dino crisis than a tr game. thats probably why the character have the red hair  resembling regina.
fun fact  resident evil 2 remake was originally a fan made indie project.capcom loved it and hired the person behind it  now re 2 remake is a cult classic thanks to single indie developer.
pandering to the insecure and twisted isn t good business nor does it make a strong society  when will they ever learn
i hope all these dedicated indie developers drive disney and every other woke company into the ground!
i do like some of these modern cinematic games .but those classic tomb raider games were so epic.i got so burnt out with the same formula of the latest trilogy. the first one was cool  but i saw it as them supposedly setting up who she would become in the classic games .we were wrong!each sequel did the same thing over and over. i couldn t even finish shadow of the tomb raider. i was just bored.
this project looks very indie and low budget. it characterizes itself as survival horror  which  given the game s theme and red-haired protagonist  prompts me to echo what others have said regarding it being inspired primarily by dino crisis moreso than tomb raider. i hope its good  but it looks very rough.
looks like what capcom would make if they wanted to reboot dino crisis...and then you say dino crisis right after i comment this.
oh god!!! it s my one weakness. crusty white dog!!!
strong inedependent and sexy women are unfortunatly unwanted nowadays according to the big developers. the trope of  daddy issues  is stronger than ever. we luckily do have asian developers who still do pretty characters with personality though.
thats a dino crisis using a tomb rider  suit  hehe
i loved the first two reboot games of tomb raider the 3rd game was boring to me though and i wish lara had personality
the problem now days is all these games are just bought off a store  they are all survival horror with janky mechanics because they just bought a bunch of asset packs.they are all basically the same except for the skin they buy.
the terms  modern audience    especially  reimagining  done became cancerous in these entertainment streets now...
it s not tomb raider. it has to be distinct and recognisable by itself.
00 30 i feel like one of my previous comments is living rent free in melonie s head. i pointed out your dog scootin its butt along the carpet one time!
this game does look awesome! but i don t think you re going to get tomb raider out of it. it s described as  survival horror   not action. there are similarities  but looking like it s own thing. honestly  someone needs to make a tomb raider spiritual successor just because melonie will shill it for free  for eternity.... anyone know a good 3d modeler
you understand that this isn t a tomb raider game  right   seemed like you were judging it harshly for not fitting croft staples like the clothing or weapon loadout or perspective.  they re trying to make something of their own  not remake lara croft.
looks too easy  she was killing every dinosaur with one shot  and they looked pretty slow.
i didn t even grow up with classic tomb raider and even i hate survivor trilogy. played a little but off the original game a few months ago and it was infinitely better.
your voice. is giving coach greg a run for its money.
everything said by melony at the start hits the truth of what s happened to the gamer world.
i m see more dino crisis than tomb raider as far as old motivation
jurassicpark meets residentevil
looks just like a dinosaur hunter game  a great tomb raider game should be atmospheric puzzle solving game not a new version of dino hunter
aww doggo
i may change my mind after seeing kate speak
i should have listed to the rest of her video as she mentioned it just a few seconds after i said my comment haha
those people who are attacking computer games are cheaters.  because we are past the stand  alone  game season  they are taking their cheating into the public  that is bizarre and narcissistic  as they want god-mode  and then play the boring games.  the problem with god-mode  it isn t a challenge  and what you did is cheat yourself.  this is why the sims is having problems  once you get money  you cannot spend it fast enough  as you max out the bank account.  they made it too easy  and then took the fun things away  like removing someone to populate your own graveyard.
there s no  aaa quality . often  aaa titles have less quality than indie titles.you could say it doesn t have aaa aesthetics  sure  but to call those aesthetics as  quality   meh.it s often over saturated garbagio.
tomb raider   turok   dino crisis
to think tomb raider ascension got shafted for the 2013 reboot cuz i think if that game was made instead of tomb raider 2013 then it would ve had more staying power cuz it would ve been a tomb raider game that fully leaned into the survival horror genre with gameplay elements from shadow of the colossus with lara scaling huge enemies and while the 2013 reboot did bring the series back into the spotlight people quickly got tired of survivor lara and it looks like ascension was at one point part of the legend timeline so we ve would ve see more of that version of lara which i think people would ve loved.
dino crisis nostalgia
to be fair  rise of the robots on the amiga 500 is better than all this modern crap.
i would not want to be wearing scant clothing while exploring in the wilderness or dungeons. i d be happier seeing the protagonist wearing fatigues whether male or female. spiders  webs  mosquitoes  hell no!
definitely dino crisis like  red hair and all.
classic  tomb raider got very formulaic by the third iteration and its reliance on  grid  style gameplay is never going to fly in the aaa space of 2023. thats just a hard fact. i ll risk a beating from melonie and say the original tr games post 3 were a bit crap going to full  undiluted pigs   e by angel of darkness. modern tr is  perversely  an uncharted knock off which was  of course  a tr knockoff which was  again of course  an indiana jones knockoff. a rebooted tomb raider could do a lot worse than crib from elden ring in giving an open space full of danger with multiple  bespoke  tombs to find  work out how to open and rob.
is it a tomb raider clone or a dino crisis clone
crystal dynamics can be jerks  or edios. push with law suit just for being just a little similar to tomb raider and lara croft. just because they fell apart and are desperate to play victim  want attention. once your franchise goes downhill no one will feel bad for you. that bridge has been burned once uncharted took over. tomb raider devs did it to themselves. uncharted was just true to itself and persevered. i know the tomb raider devs are salty. blame everyone but themselves for a killed franchise.
i watch your videos occasionally  used to watch more but am kind of fed up with all the societal narrative content in general   but i always wondered how you could support or collaborate wholeheartedly with a company like amazon whilst being christian. doesn t make sense to me.
this looks like dino crisis to me
so is there really nothing good about the new tomb raider games  nothing at all  nothing to do with the story or the characters  its all shit huh  what i am getting from that stream you did with drinker and this is  its not like the classic games so its bad. the fact that you are a fan of the classic games and don t like the newer ones is not my problem. can you at least admit that the newer games were not all bad  that they did some things well. the newer games were my intro into tomb raider and i really like them. i never really played the classic games so i can t speak on the quality of those. new tomb raider is not classic tomb raider and it was not trying to be. instead of looking at the games for what they are not. how about we look at them for what they are without comparing them to the classic games. how good are they on their own  just because they are not like the classic games that does not automatically   bad.
you should totally play rain world very difficult game
i d have to disagree with you on the legend trilogy.  it was damn hard and there were multiple times where i just wanted to quit with how difficult the puzzles were - ones where 1 wrong move and you died  instantly.  and where if you didn t time it just right ... a mere second off ... and you died instantly.don t get me wrong  i m sure the classics were much more difficult.  but to say that the legend trilogy was easy is far from accurate.it was hard because of the puzzles and though  it pissed me off while eventually beating them  it was definitely well worth the gameplay.because like you  i agree that the reboot didn t give us laura croft.  classics and legend trilogy did and i love that true laura. love your channel and all hail the true laura croft.
what ! melonie! i know you didn t like those last 3 tomb raiders... but they are hands down better than uncharted  my dear!
am i crazy or is melonies face seem swollen  i m a little concerned.
i dunno  feels more dino crisis...which is not a bad thing   d
looks like a new version of dino crisis
scant . ever seen women in summer  besides that kind of  ralism  is just overdone and b ring as h ck. if there wouden t be modders to fix stuff like this even more game genres would be dead.
@blackcroft666lp  imagine just playing a game for a female character showing more skin. i can t imagine being that pathetic and lame when there s a lot more to games than that
you obviously never listened to anything i ve ever said when i ve deep dived into the subject if this is your takeaway
at least uncharted was their own thing and not butchering an existing ip though. that makes them automatically better.
reminds me of dino crisis classic capcom game for playstation
it makes me think more of dino crisis with resident evil 4 gameplay.
lara turok  dinosaur tomb raider
mel  are you trying to get them sued  the game has to be somewhat different.
if you like this game wait until you see what i got cooking black mac
resident evil with dinosaurs...so dino crisis
she is a cutie - i kinda like what i m seeing chyeah ! i like her red-hair.
hi melonie thoughts on games like la noire and max payne
great melonie mac go boom
no switch port  oh well guess they missed a sale.
once the indies hold the keys to the kingdom your gonna see some cool shit u bedder believe it x
dino crisis vibes
so i feel this is more inspired by dino crisis than tomb raider  as i typed this i just heard you say dino crisis.
surprised that she doesn t know dino crisis  it s basically what it is  not as good  an tps indie version
they need to go back to how it was in tomb raider 5
they could have did this with dino crisis but no capcom messed up.
melanie did you say dinosaurs  because if it is a video game that has dinosaurs in it i m game i ll get it in a flat second
i don t know  i m not getting tomb raider outta this primal omen  but instead a 3rd person on the shoulder dino crisis thing here.
this is as close to the classic tomb raider as you can get where i can get this game.
kinda remands me of dino crisis the women in that had redhair
lara croft meets jurassic park.
anyone else see tomb raider meets dino crisis
this sounds more like dino crisis to me.
lara croft shouldhave more skills.. did lara croftstudy dinosaurs..
britanny venti s yt channel was banned i don t have twitter so this is me trying to get the word out
i do know someone is remaking tomb raider angel of darkness
hmmm  melonie mac just found her new bf lol
so it s dino crisis.
it s looks more dino crisis jurassic park then tomb raider
sadly  the weakest segment of society is dictating what we all should do.
this is just dino crisis lol
over the shoulder jurassic park  or gears of saurs....lol
dino tomb  crisis raider
looks like dino crisis
this game looks like a shooter lara croft. hmmm... i m intrigued. i don t mind the outfit. she isn t lara  she should be a bit different.
i can t tell what it is  but you look slightly different. is it less makeup  a different camera angle or lighting
why are they saying tomb raider  looks more dino crisis than anything to me.
0 20epic puppeh shakes!!!
0 21 doggo!
dino crisis competitor.
i am a resident evil and tomb raider fan
looks like dino crisis
i don t think this is tomb raider inspired tbh it looks more to me like its the last of us inspired but with dinosaurs  besides the outfit and the hair i don t really see the tomb raider similarities.
its like jurassic park meets tomb raider. i dont have enough information to form an opinion.
the new laura oh yea i know her she doesn t use two guns
bushcraft skills
you re comparing this to tomb raider   but this isn t tomb raider  or is it i m confused
a game where you play as a hot red head that has not been beaten with the ugly stick  also tomb raider ish game of old  im down for it. primal omen might be that game  i remeber playing tomb raider back in the day when women had edges.
11 28 hahah! gold
seems more like jurassic park however.
so many dinosaurs. maybe it s her job to make them extinct again
looks more like dino crisis
lol there s nothing wrong with the reboot trilogy and the lara croft of that trilogy.
dino crisis remake
jurassic lara!
yay puppy
please... tell me this game have some dino crisis easter egg reference
turok  croft edition
they should rename it the dinobully.
i don t think it s tomb raider competitor just like everywhere isn t competitor to gta 6. . .
it s a tr-like  but we have an over the shoulder camera !   ! it says here that you re a heretic!
reject modern audience bs embrace companies that give consumers what they want
i feel sry this girl was cursed with that voice
the answer it s yes. they are not pressed to follow any agenda
i dont care about survival horror game. i want more of a puzzle and adventure game.

looks more like dino crisis
imagine disliking the classic tomb raider games... burn in hell!
lara croft fuckin rocks
look like ark mixed with tomb raider.
play live when u get it
turok ...
shih tzu!!!
doggo!!!
that s why all these fake bandwagon gamers hated elden ring. no handholding participation trophies. you had to earn every battle and they hated it lol.
nah  is more like re6 meets dino crisis
it s looks more like a indie dino crisis not a indie tomb raider
looks more like dino crisis
its dino crisis
i will!
i shut the butler in the fridge.  did you
looks closer to dino crisis tbh.also  it looks very rough unpolished. needs a couple of years in the oven.
this game looks utterly atrocious  the concept is perfectly fine  it s a tried and tested formula but the animations are too basic and unnatural.it reminds me of the old steam greenlight shovelware from 2015.
i m gameplay over graphics
dino crisis
i am sorry melnoie  but this looks more like a dino crisis remake rather than a tomb raider game!
i don t think this is a  tomb raider  knock-off but a  dino crisis  knock-off instead.
a red-headed white woman as the protagonist  they do exist!
this is not tomb raider  it s just jurassic park.
crara loft
lol
that game looks like mix of resident evil and dino crisis. not much of a tr.
dino crisis
m00f !
...you d think they d have more respect for an intelligent female character...
meh. the usual ue4 asset flip like many others.
sorry but this looks more like an indie dino crisis on a tropical island and the shown gameplay confirms this. the only resemblance to classic tr is the main char
i loved the 2012 reboot and its first sequel  the last one was lame af.
looks like a generic 3rd  person shooter so far  this isn t classical tomb raider.
what is this lol dino crisis
doggo
it s a fallout 4 clone mod. i m sorry look and you will see it. same camera and mechanics.
hello pretty melonie and cool dog  we want a hot lara with a nice adventure  it so hard to make  why devs dont paid attention to re 4 remake. also for and indie im totally ok kinda like dino crisis.
it s dino hunter with a female  i m not impressed
looks pretty meh
turoka croft the dinosaur huntress. i also miss golden age n64 gamecube   ps1 2 xbox. although turok was never good after n64 brilliance. the light faded from these peoples eyes now just meat locusts wanting feed and reproduce. baby girl super easy modes just grinding for resources swatting butterflies for xp till everything so o.p while enemies dont lvl its boring travesty of gameplay
game looks like bad and nothing like tomb raider. just having dinos and having a female character don t make it tomb raider.. they showed off no platforming or exploration or puzzles. it looks more like fans of dinocrisis took inspiration from the re remake games and made their own take on dinocrisis because capcom isn t delivering.
!!im gonna show you wha happened! ! ....lovenow  the 1st thru...4th eidos loved yheir ipbut  after 4she had too much competition. codbattlefieldhalomen at arms they constantly git shot in da face whilst shooting everyone else inda faces !laurawas nawt made to be shot  she shoots....and we love her for it...see....love
this has nothing  zero to do with tomb raider  lol more like a dino crisis game. lol hahahahadino crisis is all about dino s and regina has red hair and dc was a survival horror.nothing to do with tomb raider.
wtf are you talking about the first new tr was amazing and the others are good. it s not easy on hard and the tomb puzzles are challenging. you smokin something....
this game doesn t look like tr at all not even similar to newer ones more like dino crisis re remake also i m sick of this indie lame crap pushed on consoles.and lara has solid brown hair not even close to red.
oh yea  well  the dinosaurs in the indie will be racist. so  keep buying the terrible new tomb raider...or are you a fan of bigoted dinosaurs
i send pets to the puppers!!! pet pet pet edit for those who have one  bust out the raspberry pi and play some dino crisis!!!
no
first!!!
first
stop gatekeeping. one of the first games i played was the original tomb raider and i completed it. i enjoy story  that doesn t mean a game must be difficult for me to enjoy. i have served my time in the  dante must die  mode and in the  european extreme  difficulty. you have no idea about difficulty and being able to enjoy a story. yes games are easier now but i  and a lot of my gamer friends  honestly don t give a shit. we don t have time to perfect combos or get ss rank because we have full time jobs and families we love.
bruh the reboot games are a cakewalk! especially in the areas tomb raider used to be difficult on  puzzles and traversal especially . a chimpanzee could solve those puzzles  combat can be difficult on harder modes  but just because a bad guy can survive a bunch of hits does not make it dynamic challenging gameplay
nah  lara was constantly screaming and her actress was far too melodramatic in her performance.the 2013 reboot worked as an origin but she remained that way all throughout the trilogy  the dialogue was awful  the writing laghableand it all felt like a daytime soap opera in rise and even more so in shadow.
