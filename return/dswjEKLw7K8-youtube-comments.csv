i really like how you speak from the heart when it comes to your faith. people can  probably will  use that against you but keep the faith and it will come to benefit you in the end.keep being you mel  its really good  a breath of fresh air so to speak

always great to see another melonie mac video grace my feed. they always make my day.

it's great to see you glowing again and being happy  you have an incredible style but most of all your faith and sharing it is amazing you have a great ministry

brittany was right  melonie is like a ray of sunshine  and you cant help but like her and want to protect her. those of us who are far away  and not terribly financially well off  can only offer our hopes and prayers that all will be well  but we will continue to do so. its good to see she already seem in better spirits. we all love ya  melonie.

i'm glad you re back feeling well! i am praying for your health  safety and well being  and praying for sean to be shown wisdom.

melonie is such a kind person. i pray for her protection and for her to have strength.

your christianity is a rare gem in this increasingly anti-christian culture  melonie. thank you for mentioning that in your channel. you are doing jesus  work fighting our culture. i already follow critical drinker and nerdrotic  but their language leaves room for improvement. you ve earned my respect and my subscription  sister. god bless you.

same! i had to subscribe when she started talking about jesus within 15 minutes of the first hogwarts stream.

you re the only video game youtuber i ve seen that talks about confidently about relationship with christ and i will forever appreciate that.

i just finally started checking out your videos.  it s so awesome to see you standing up for your christian beliefs while enjoying everything that nerd culture has to offer.  never stop being you.  praying for your stalker situation.  you know god s got this.

heads up  stay strong  everything will turn out fine    i just recently found your channel  because of the streams with drinker . love your content and the community you ve build. let nobody ever take that away from you and keep making great videos like this one! all the best from germany
love you melenone  i m  so glad you are doing better and you are doing such great things for the gaming community and christain community as well. keep it up!!!

you have me in your corner. i m not a christian  i m not a gamer  but you have a voice that needs to be heard. nobody has 100  of the truth  but the things that you say are part of the truth. keep on keeping on melonie mac!!

the end of this video is night and day from yesterday    glad to see you in good spirits today making a positive video. i ve got a long way to go but you kicked my butt to get to the gym and eat butter  i mean whoops eat better and i hope you can continue to do that to help many other people.  grazie  melonie

you are speaking many truths people are afraid to say   i m subscribing for your honest content
