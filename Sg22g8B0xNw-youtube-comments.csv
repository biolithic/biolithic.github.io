disney took away the unique thing about wendy when they added in girls among the lost boys because in the original  she is seen as a mother figure to the boys who never had a loving and caring parent their whole lives in neverland until she showed up.
alright. we need a new movie. any ideas   how about an african folktale adaptation   something about native americans   a story set in feudal japan   what about a live-action peter pan with female lost boys and black tinkerbell   snaps finger   you. you re hired.
disney used to touch our hearts  now they touch us inappropriately.
the funny thing is that in the original scottish author intent  the lost boys  are only boys because  girl don t fall off their stroller  which was the author way of saying  the risk of not growing up and adopt responsabilities was only a problem for young men. ..in fact wendy  as young as she was  she was the most mature person in the story  so much so she was the surrogate mother for all lost boys...so disney is shooting down women.. again..but hey rappresentation! am i right
i feel like disney would make more money re-releasing the old animated movies into theaters than they would with these live action movies. i d love to go see the old animated robin hood on the big screen.
when i hear the words  made for a modern audience  i say to myself  there s something to avoid .
this trailer is making the 2003 version look like a masterpiece
if disney doesn t stop trying to appeal to the mythical modern audience  they re going to lose their real audience who just want to be entertained.
this whole thing is what s pushing me even harder to publish my book. no bs  no woke agenda  none of that. i was inspired by berserk to write dark fantasy and i wanna make a difference.
making wendy a warrior is my biggest issue with this movie.
watching you go through a range of disinterest  disappointment  and annoyance is more entertaining than this doa movie will ever be lol
when they say  modern audiences  what they really mean is  modern critics .
hook is the only live action peter pan we re ever going to need.why is wendy fighting as well  she was the caring motherly figure to the lost boys not someone who went off fighting pirates  although its been a while since i saw the original movie so maybe she did do that.
my favorite part of the trailer was when peter looked at captain hook and said  look at me. i m the caption now.  gave me chills.
if they really wanted to do something edgy then they could have made a live action peter pan true to the original story. the original story was more frightening then anything that s ever been presented as peter pan.
the real problem for me is the girls with the lost boys wich erase one of the biggest message of the story   message about maternity attached to femininity. peter bring wendy back with him precisely because she s a girl and a mother figure. beside there is a also a kind and cute explanation as well in the book   with the lost boys.  who are they   they are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way. if they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses. i m captain.  what fun it must be!  yes   said cunning peter   but we are rather lonely. you see we have no female companionship.  are none of the others girls   oh  no  girls  you know  are much too clever to fall out of their prams. this flattered wendy immensely.  i think   she said   it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls
whenever i hear the phrase modern audiences in my head i can hear the critical drinker saying  the message!
disney s tinkerbell is one of the most iconic characters in animation. she has a look that endures even after so many years. even if you never watched peter pan  she is recognizable  especially since she used to show up in those disney intros.so  of course  disney decided to change her into someone unrecognizable  because  modern audiences  or something.
have to fly  have to fight.have to crow. have to save maggie  have to save jack .hook is back  the only live action peter pan movie we will ever need.
when captain hook said  its hooking time   raised his hook and turned wendy into a hooker   it gave me chills number 15 top 20 spookiest moments countdown
exactly
they also made girls dumb. in the og there were no girls in the lost boys because they were too smart to  get lost.  but women empowerment or something...
@edward santos  even the robin williams hook it was lost boy the abc once upon a time lost boys and that was channel 7. hugh jackman blackbeard i say they have done better adoption of disney characters as of right now no wonder why this is a failure
exactly also it doesn t make sense that lost boys would be named lost boys if there girls lmao they would be called lost children
mother figures are viewed as a weak role now. women are supposed to be portrayed as manly now and having traditional masculine traits like gumption and a fighting spirit.
modern femininity views things like pregnancy  child birth and motherhood as  patriarchal  and  backwards . by the end of the movie wendy will be the new pan  not peter  and she will be romantically involved with princess tiger lily
@will joyner  not necessarily. maybe the girls identify themselves as boys.
@edward santos  yup  nothing says women empowerment like dumbing the girls down.
yup  how many potential stories are still out there. they did coco  vanao  encanto. see they can do something... but nope  gotta take a 50 year old classic and do this with it... hooray.
meanwhile in japan  we got hoodoo  we got voodoo  we got things you ain t even tried! but most of all....we got money thanks to our  friends  on the other side!
give this man a raise!
hollywood is just at the lowest point ever!  all of the entertainment.  like the netflix vikings.  i gave it a try.  till i seen a black lady as the jarl of kattegat  no originality.  no new ideas.  just literally everything from the 80 s and 90 s remade.  what a great era of television
nah that would be cultural appropriation  and we cant have that  but we need more diversity too  dont ask questions just comsume product
@envix  how bold of them to assume that being a mother is a weakness. as a mother myself  i m going to have to disagree. really  any good mother would want to be strong for their children. it takes a lot of strength to be a good mum  especially emotional strength.
in trying to add woman empowerment to this movie  they re making the girls dumber
@raymond smith  anyone who sees pregnancy and childbirth as weakness obviously knows nothing about those things. having to endure those experiences is no walk in the park. i think it takes a lot strength to be willing to go through all of that discomfort to bring life into the world.
@raymond smith  yeah  motherhood is something to be proud of not something to be ashamed of. they re downplaying the importance of being a mother. it s actually a big responsibility. we re not just supposed to be our children s caretakers  we re also supposed to be their teachers as well. it s a parents responsibility to help teach them right from wrong  for example  and to help them become the best version of themselves. it s not a role to be taken so lightly.
can t show the power of the feminine  can we  we have to make it all masculine because it..  consults notes  empowers women
@luna moth  i agree with you. there is strength in femininity i believe and they don t need to swap gender traits to make strong characters. they re just trying to appeal to the common consensus perspective instead of taking the risk to be creative. the original peter pan achieved making wendy a strong feminine character with feminine traits but today s society will just ignore it because it s not what s in the media these days.
so peter has a harem
@luna moth  or them being men
you guys have watched critical drinker video  no  yep i agree.
also it s going to change tink.   she hated wendy because she had been the only girl. her jealous behavior was a big part of the character.
wendy is played by mila jovovich s daughter   ever anderson   so you know from the start she s going to be a  girl boss  just like her mom.
but that doesn t represent modern audiences
@christopher loyd  the lost boys from hook are increidible amazing. despite peter pan left them. they managed to survive on their own. not to mention  they have that instinct of rebelsthey re all racial diversea movie from 1991 by steven spielberg which is awesome
almost as if the lost boys tribe had a pertinent part of the story.
just watch 2003 peter pan y all
@envix  john cena should be wendy
this. they make changes all the time without stopping to think about how it will change the story being told.
yes exactly
not even sure why they d bother with retelling a story from the 1800 s if they re that bothered by the cultural norms of the time. you might as well make an original modern film that fits your sensibilities
wendy s daughter in peter pan 2 became the first lost girl . why do they already have them
that s because women are not supposed to nurture anymore.  they are to have careers.
how about another live action remake  we ve had 3 make over a billion. no white people went and saw wakanda forever so we have to put some representation in peter pan.
i know we don t really do this anymore but can we make something that s faithful to the original   who let this racist in here  ! get out! you ll never work again!
@jim jams  exactly!!!!!!
this is literally an example of woke. said so perfectly  i wouldn t be surprised if this is exactly how the meeting went.
i mean the reason for no stories of african folklore is because no one wants those either lol. those would probably do worse. most disney fans are white very small percentage is african american and i don t see those doing well because the average disney fan won t care for it.
@amber m  doesn t matter where the story is from  as long as its told and presented in a good and entertaining way. the fact that its not known to a white audience wouldn t necessarily make it less appealing it would be new and different and harder to predict. as a white person  i ve been reading over some african fairy tales and folk tales  and they re entertaining and i can see them being adapted well yes  some liberties would be taken to make them longer or more cinematic  but that s been done with the rest too  such as tangled  frozen  a lot of changes there  and even cinderella. besides that  a character doesn t have to have your skin tone to be likeable and relatable to you. that s part of the reason the race-swapping makes so little sense  but i do think those different stories could work if the effort was made.
why does it have to be  african  for it to involve black people  if that s what you meant
@juan potgieter  did you just assume their gender ! !
@yakattack  and black achiles. and black anne boleyn  which is even worse because she s a historical figure and not a fictional character.
@vertigo  because disney has already made movies with black protagonists that are set in the us  princess and the frog and soul . they have also made stories set in other cultures. so why not make one about africa  except for the lion king since the characters are all animals and it has no humans
@magallanes agustin  i mean do you personally want african stories
@vertigo  yeah  why not
@magallanes agustin  also  it s hilarious you think 1 movie is enough for an entire race lol!
@vertigo  again  where s the problem with wanting a movie adaptation of an african story  and when did i say one movie was enough  don t put words in my mouth.
they can just added a new character like a black fairy as tinkerbell friend. no need to turn her into a black fairy.
@norran  is that your biggest problem with the movie
@magallanes agustin  i apologise for how i came across. you are obviously well intended.
@vertigo  just look what happened to the little mermaid. i feel kind of sad for that black girl that played the mermaid. she must have thought playing that character will advanced her acting career but instead it s destroy it. this what happened when you join the world of wokeness.
@norran  precisely
don t forget an indian and hispanic peter pan for extra diverse points and the continued elimination of any culture from the people who supposedly  have no culture .
tink is going to be like zarina... goes around stealing pixie dust!
@summer christina dotson  a racist comment  well done.
oh sorry i m  appropriating  that one.
yeah. that phrase is gonna blow up.  did you make it up
bad touch!!! bad touch!!! stranger danger!!!
@alice bowie no  it has been used many times now  but it still makes me laugh everytime because it s so true. i ve used it myself but have no idea where it originally came from.
that s hilarious but accurate
killer comment right here  hope it gets the attention it deserves
fun fact  the first movie to say  vagina  was a disney film.
@broken fingers  wow. really  which film
@onemanarmy36  it was some educational film about menstruation from like the 40s heh.
well said
excellent point ...yeah
yeah  it is basic human nature. the original had simple ideas done rather well. like how girls mature faster than boys  how they civilize men and set the standards for acceptable behaviour  how women are more sensible  and how a mother s love and guidance can make all the difference and shouldn t be taken for granted.this new remake is as pointless as the gender-swapped lord of the flies remake that got shelved.
@valentine gonsalves  oh wow i didn t know they tried to do it to lord of the flies...
unfortunately  woke activists behind this movie completely missed the point of original  peter pan  and wendy s character.
@valentine gonsalves so  women are better than men  was the initial intention. seems like this new remake is saying  fuck that . the irony..
incredible what they re doing  isn t it
@bamid l   what s incredible
this deserves to be pinned to the top...insightful and well said  good sir.
in part of the trailer  wendy can be seen throwing two of hook s pirate minions off her with just one push during a sword fight  making them look like incompetent idiots even though no such thing should be able to occur if your upper body strength is lower than that of two stronger people bearing down on you  so you could say the gender patronism here is two-fold  it s being used to hurt both women and men  albeit in different respects.oh  the double standards
@onemanarmy36  it doesn t matter who s the first one made that joke  just enjoy it
i m sure most of the disney child actors can attest to that
best comment ever!
was bound to happen honestly

i m still waiting to be surprised with original content and their studio is churning out remakes. you would think a huge conglomerate could do something to show its still making the high quality content of a century ago. hasn t happened and i m keeping my expectations low.
apparently they attempted this and it didn t work.
i imagine the people who are interested enough to see those movies in a theater probably already have physical copies of those movies
i don t think that s gonna work in a business perspective. a lot of people already have those old animated movies on home video or on a digital platform so what s the point of still paying for a ticket to see those old animated movies on the big screen
nah  they d lose esg points because there s not enough diversity and representation. and say what you want about the state of disney  parents will flock to theatres because this is for kids. its why disney makes bank with this stuff. as much as nerds are awesome  normies outnumber the nerds.
as french. i will be very mad and piss off if they re planning to remake hunchback of notre dame. it s part of our french history legacy. the incident that happened in 2019  the spire was burned downed  was already enough pain
a compromise  they could re-release the old animation classics in imax resolution but recolor some characters to black  everyone wins.
arn saknussen i won t let them screw victor hugo novels
even when they just say they re doing a remake or a sequel  i have the same response.
agreed
as someone whose favorite book as a child was peter pan  i can say the 2003 version was a masterpiece because it actually stuck to the source material.
to late.
they already have. i m done with everything disney. i won t be going to a theatre for any movie by them until 0 woke is in it.
i have a feeling the regime change bringing back bog iger is probably going to bring with it disney returning to what they were doing 10-15 years ago with much less emphasis on woke stuff because woke has proven to be awful for disney s bottom line.that said  these blockbuster scale movie projects are greenlit often half a decade before they are released so i don t expect to start seeing the impact of that for at least 3-4 years and until then every disney project will continue to be pandering to the leftwing agenda because it was greenlit during this absurd few years where identity politics have hit a crescendo.
there are too many flops for it to be stupidity. it s social engineering at any cost.
@rachal c  the leaders of the company may not but the investors do so one way or another as long as  we  the market say no to this bs  it will shift back. we just need to stand firm and not give them money. we also have to make that decision on behalf of our children who are the ones they are really trying to corrupt. they know they won t convince you and i but if they can meld the minds of the next generation...
@ryan cooper  oh definitely. i m ready to hold the line with this awesome fellowship. let s starve out the woke if we can.
i assure you they don t care for that audience.
they lost me long time ago
publishers are captured by the woke ideology  as i am sure you know. i wish you the best of luck  it s really tough nowadays.
@dexcova  im in europe  where those laws don t apply lol haha but thank you
are you in europe
berserk is awesome
@igni drakkos  huh ye ye
just make sure to publish it. tired of people saying no to woke and never make non woke content.
i wish you the best of luck. may it become the new berserk.
nows the time for that. we hunger for real stories
let s get it!!!!
what  you don t think a 13 year old girl can effectively engage in a swordfight against multiple adult men at once  how sexist of you!!
@ryan cooper  who s only combat experience is playing with her younger brothers in their rooms and the pirates she s fighting have possibly more years of experience than the amount of years they would appear to have been alive for
@ryan cooper  do you think an untrained pony haired girl  that just picked up a lightsaber and could beat a fully yearly trained sith lord realistically
@jackson cabrera  hahah  i wasn t suggesting rey was realistic  just that this is even worse. at least with rey you can make the argument that it is the  will of the force  acting through her yadda yadda yadda the same with anakin was naturally super skilled at things.  as far as we know  wendy is a normal human 13 year old child with no latent powers or special abilities.
@ryan cooper  lol
strong whamans
@jackson cabrera  btw kylo ren wasn t a sith lord.
you cannot have a female character in 2023 that isnt a badass
they ran out of original ideas. will not watch anymore remakes.
they lost us years ago
@ryan cooper  i hope things are changing.   studios need to stop acting like benevolent saviors come to save us from our terrible selves.
@ryan cooper  iger is the one who started them on the woke road before he left.
@steve cavanagh  yep and unfortunately there s going to be a decade of dark age where every media release is hot garbage when my kid gets old enough. i ll be showing him the old movies.
@ninja368  i suspect that wasn t because he was radically left but rather reacting to pressure. he was also the leader of disney through a period of great content.
that sounds awesome! did you like bastard too
@xaforn  oh hell ye heavy metal dark fantasy is so good!
@clyde wy  i m in the uk - it is the same here
@dexcova  i mean i m in france and things aren t so woke tbh  maybe you have it harder
go for it. there needs to be more media pushing back against this trash.
what does dark fantasy even mean is it like how the witchers world is kind of depressing and lacks whimsical goodness like in other fantasies
@chandller burse  pretty much. it s usually lacks happy setting for dominant evil universe.
@clyde wy  yeah  maybe you re right. uk publishers in general are gatekeepers for the woke agenda  particularly diversity  but it is a very narrow range of diversity based along gender  sexuality  and race.maybe you also saw the recent news headlines about sensitivity readers which these publishers employ
@dexcova  if  sensitivity readers  read my shit they d stop reading period lol  nah i didn t know this thing even existed bro that s nonsensical
agreed. i saw the trailer as an ad. watched it once. this video i was looking only at melonie. this movie is such a joke. will still make money because parents will take their kids to see this. just like lion king and beauty and the beast.
yeah  they mean  the woke mob .
@anthony dolbec  the kind of mob that ll never see the films they re praising
what they really mean is  modern maninstream media  who somehow set the norms for the rest of america
its 2023. motherhood is considered a  bad  thing and all female characters must be combat capable in action films and always rescue themselves.
just can t wait for the touching peter pan hook romance they teased. riveting
ha! i don t even know if that makes sense
words on a screen have never held my attention until now!
my favorite thing about 2030 is that we are all finally dead and don t have to see reptitive unoriginal jokes like this anymore.this was funny with morbius but now its just depressing.also get uppity with me if you want i don t care my point stands.
exactly so what s the point of wendy if they put girls in with the lost boys. it makes wendy obsolete to the story.
@jason lowe   cause this wendy was not diverse enough
then after that i hear  just go away now
hook was a good movie. robbin williams  dustin hoffman and julia roberts did a great job in it  along with the children.
bangarang!!!
amen!
rufio rufio rufio
fkn right. rip robin williams.
lol
you win for funniest comment.
i did not see this comment coming!    damn!!
me  looking at disney s stock  i remember you being a lot bigger.
i like how they raceswapped tinker bell when a black fairy already exists...like bruh... iridessa if you re wondering on who i m referring to.
the most surprising thing about this trailer is that disney didn t change the lost boys to the lost kids for a  modern audience.
i wonder what orson scott card has to say about the  lost boys  makeover  he also wrote  ender s game  and i highly recommend reading the book then watching the movie. terrific story and spawned an amazing book series.
i ll just go back to watch hook. i miss robin williams.you look beautiful  melonie. have a great day and enjoy your long weekend with your fam.
great video!  as always. i read this book every time i went to stay at my grandmother s when i was a kid.  when she passed away her copy became my copy.  so i know it pretty well and read about j.m. barrie and his thoughts when writing the books  which makes me wonder about some of this.as i remember  the lost boys were all boys because girls were too smart to get themselves lost when very young.  so way to imply that girls are now much stupider i guess   this is disney  so  yeah  sure.wendy was brought along to neverland to be the caretaker mother figure for the lost boys.  but i bet that s now completely forgotten.in the book the lost boys were brawling in group free for all fights very often.  is that going to be shown in this too the bit of the story left out of the animated series was that peter killed the lost boys who grew up too much.  so i guess we can look forward to seeing peter slitting some female lost boys  throats when they have their menses on the plus side  i like the looks of the darling children.  that s not me being creepy  that was their surname in the books  wendy  john  and peter darling.  they all look their parts  and i like that the young lady playing wendy looks like a fairly normal girl instead of a ms. perfect from central casting.don t care if the other actors are color gender swapped  even if it may strain belief.  all that matters is that they can play their roles well.  i could accept that 5 8  julia roberts was a under 6  tall tinkerbell in hook easily  so no big deal.  but i doubt that the script and the characterizations are going to be classic but instead be  modern audiences .  so  if it even appears  the indian native american tribe will probably not be the piccaninny tribe and if the chieftain s daughter tiger lily is in the movie she ll probably be heroically rescuing peter from drowning instead of the other way around in the book and animated movie.  hard pass for me.  just like every other live action remake that the creatively bankrupt disney has put out for way too long.
i was specifically waiting for your  lost girls  reaction!  this is starting out swimmingly  !
the only live action peter pan movie i acknowledge and love is hook with robin williams
i think the mandalorian said it best  never trust a pirate kid.
my favourite family movies this past year are puss in boots  the last wish and minions  the rise of gru. they re both just fun movies for families to watch and puss in boots has surprising depth. it s kind of like what pixar used to make  tone-wise.
i love how on disney plus before you watch peter pan it gives the viewer a warning about the movie
when wendy unleashed  sky dragon s roar!  at captain hook and his pirate crew  i smiled with pure happiness and glee.
that s weird  i remember a live action remake of pan from when i was a kid.... it s called hook!
honestly a good live adaptation for peter pan was already done in 2003. but i know something done 20 years ago isn t woke enough for modern audiences. even though i liked it better than the animated classic.
in a world of the most powerful companies competing with each other for the most mundane and 2nd rate material possible with the highest cost to launder money  this is an award nominee.
it s funny that they didn t just make the live action of the tinker bell movies  where they have all the ethnic backgrounds represented.
if you want to see a live adaptation of peter pan then go watch hook with robin williams
true! the reason we get so little good entertainment is because they just don t want to take any risks with new stuff. better be on the safe side and do a remake or use a recognized ip  and to be on the safe side race genderswap some characters to appease critics and so they can blame the audience when the film fails.
i loved the part where wendy looked tearfully at peter and said   you had me at hello.   so moving.
the best thing for us to do is simply don t give disney our money. when earnings drop and they have to disclose that in their quarterly report then the board of directors is going to send for the executives. they are going to demand to know why and if the disney people come back with  well people are just ...ists  that won t go over. blaming people and making excuses doesn t pay the bills. as long as people give them  money they have no incentive to put out something good.
this mad me think of the halo 4 scene where cdr. palmer first meets the chief.   i thought you d be taller.
@falcon_by_the_lake  it was supposed to be a  hook  reference  but i can see where it would remind you of that.
nice
say  you re a lot smaller than disney s last stocks. either that or i m getting bigger! look at me from the side  do i look different to you!
yep
i am so happy who remember the tinker bell movies and that there was a black fairy and that was the first thing i thought of when i saw the trailer
there s a black mermaid  too.
@a. b.  yeah  gabriella from the little mermaid s animated series
@jak superior  checks wikishe s a deaf  and mute   latina. ollie  her octopus friend  translates for her via sign language. projects about interesting poc side characters  nah. race swap another white main character  the message
that s what i say too! tinkerbell has a whole franchise of her own with poc fairies  fucking use them please!
that s what i was thinking
ender s game was - and still remains - awesome  some ten years after i last read it.  shocking ending  surprisingly plausible descriptions of space-station infantry combat - two thumbs up.i still need to read xenocide and speaker for the dead.
hook is a very underrated movie these days. so many kids don t even know it exists.
i loved puss in boots as well!!! it was such a breath of fresh air during a time of woke cinema!
xd this comment deserves more likes.
cheria    wendy worst loli.
underrated comment.
love this reference.
wendy marvel
there was one that came out in 2003  overshadowed by return of the king and harry potter.
oh man  yes. going to rewatch it and hook and the cartoon to get this out of my head.
it can t just even be peter pan. it has to be peter pan and wendy.
there actually was an excellent live action retelling of beauty and the beast from like 10 years ago. done by the french. which i suppose makes sense  given that s where the story mostly originated.  it starred vincent cassel and lea seydoux.  highly recommend if you actually like fairy tales.
i like the part where peter pan said   it s pannin time!  and then wendy said   yea  i think i m back.
wendy looks awesome it fits her character so well. i also don t mind peter pan. but tinker bell is so iconic why change what isn t broken and is beloved by literal millions.
as a silent protest  i m gonna bet both hook  and the 2003 s peter pan movie  which is a faithful adaption of the original story  are going to be a top selling movies on amazon list before and after this live action farce.
9 16 -- classic melonie mac right there. love it!
i would have admired the writers in a backhanded sort of way if the girls had insisted  of course we re boys!  in order to keep the name making sense on one hand  and for scoring trans-points on the bingo card.
actress who plays wendy is the same one who plays young natasha romanov in black widow. she happens to be milla jovovich s daughter.
wouldn t be a shock if lost boys turn into lost them they
back with reactions  always love em!
i guarantee you that tinkerbell and the mermaids are not gonna be jealous and petty with wendy like in the original  they ll all be super empowered badasses and extremely supportive and encouraging towards wendy
i can t wait for the  snow black  trailer to come out.
it s not that you re remember seeing the  actress  playing wendy  it s just that she s been given the guyladrial treatment and that s just something you can t unsee. may as well just call this movie rings of pan.
wendy s expression for the entire trailer
the part where mel says  it s trailer time  blows my mind!!! you go girl!!!
shout out to you melanie!! great reaction to the trailer
hey hold on here! you re no longer allowed to call tinkerbell a  fairy  as that can be considered anti-lgbtq .   it s diminutive airborne person!
tinkerbell had a black fairy friend in the animated tv series idk why they couldn t just include her. same with ariel s black mermaid friend from the animated little mermaid series.
i remember an older peter pan live-action which i thought was pretty good. aside from the robin williams  hook  that was quite interesting too
i m from newfoundland canada and i m pretty sure the movie was filmed here if not all of the movie im pretty sure  the scenery and landscape stuff is that s the only reason why i might watch the movie
yeah the name of the original book
@llama drama  maybe the only thing disney is honoring from the original
i would love to see the results of a show titled  lost they .
exactly
i know  right
they could have just called them  the lost children  but they want everyone to know it s  the lost boys  with girls
happy to like your videos now. we need you  so good to hear you sounding happy too!
when pan pointed his cutlass at hook and said  my name is inigo montoya  you killed my father prepare to die!  ka-ching.
i loved the part where disney lost hundreds of millions of dollars and still didn t manage to learn their lesson.
really love when peter said  autobot roll out   makes me feels like his touching inside me
the super mario bros movie is the only movie i care about right now lol
i knew what to expect before i even watched the trailer. but yeah  my reaction was pretty much the same. all i can say is thank goodness we have og disney to fall back on.
i ve noticed whether or not characters get race or gender swapped depends on the source material.if the source material features an all male cast there s a gender swap.if the source material features an all white cast there s a race swap.some examples are 1. fantastic four all white. michael b. jordan is now a black johnny storm.2. ghost busters  all male cast now female 3. oceans 8. all male cast now  all female.4. superman. perry white now played by laurence fishburn.5. dare devil. king pin played by michael clarke duncan.6. avengers  heimdall  now played by idris elba.7. avengers  nick fury  now played by samuel jackson. 8. deadpool  domino  now played by zazie beetz.9. baywatch  mitch  now played by dwayne johnson.10. the mummy  got both race and gender swapped.11. annie  race swapped from white to black.12. pet semetary  victor race swapped from white to black.some examples without race or gender swaps 1. x-men. the source material has both male and female characters  storm is black  psylocke  and jubilee are asian.2. star trek  source material had uhura a black woman  and sulu an asian man.3. guardian of the galaxy  original comic book had male and female characters  a raccoon  and a tree.4. it and it part 2  source material had a mike  a black male  and beverly a white female.5. alita battle angel  source material has alita a female  vector a black male.6. mission impossible  original tv show had barney  a black male  the movies had luther played by ving rhames.8. alien  1st movie had ripley  a woman  and parker a black man.
i loved the part when peter said  it s panting time  and started to pan all over the neverland truly gonna be a movie.
remember hook  such a good movie
loved the part when tiger lily says  let s make america great again   so inspiring.
first peter pan movie where people might be rooting for captain hook this time.
disney is in a state of complete creative bankruptcy
i know this is off-topic  but i really enjoy your  podcast with camelot. i think you  too  and it sagundam are my new favorite youtubers
the lost  they them  part was brave and stunning.
that deja vu feeling is because wendy is played by ever anderson  milla jovovich s daughter.
is nice see milla jovovich s daughter follow her steps by being on awful adaptations of beloved franchises
i always thought the big point of peter pan in general was not wanting to grow up but accepting it and embracing it. there is a lot to unpack with this iteration of peter pan. but in regards to these  lost boys .i always thought it was meaningful that the  lost boys   were all actual boys specifically  and the underlying theme about them was about accepting the responsibilities of growing into a man and what comes with it. especially if a boy lacks a solid father figure to guide them like the lost boys. --as every fatherless boy still need to become a man without one to show them the way. also it is a fact girls mature faster and most young girls generally don t need to be told to  grow up  at the same rate as boys.  --heck  is there a man alive that has not been constantly told to grow up countless times   im sure some girls hear it too but not at the same rate today more than ever there are so many fatherless boys in the world that will soon be men. and in light of this i think shoehorning girls into the group just for the sake of it destroys the potential for an important message to them. it is a real shame they are missing an opportunity to speak to these boys and young men  who like the lost boys are fatherless and on an island of their own.
i can t even be bothered to be upset with these modern disney movies anymore  we already know what their playbook is  so we may as well invest the energy we wouldn t to crying out into something better.like creating our own entertainment
you mispronounced the title of the movie it s called  wendy and the lost girls it s about wendy discovering she can fight better than gown men and that she never needed a boy to teach her to fly. also  she has a platonic  yet still romantic  female life partner. very brave.
glad i have physical copies from the past
@bourbon brisk  same here. i have most of disney s movies on dvd.
@super spoon  just be nice if i had some of the shows also
@bourbon brisk  i only managed to get a few like duck tales  darkwing duck and talespin.
right there with ya  i just look  sigh and say  oh god they are at it a again.
the girl who plays wendy is apparently the one who played young natasha in the beginning of black widow. maybe that s why she seems familiar.i agree with what you said about the live action remakes but i will always like the 2015 version of cinderella starring lily james  richard madden and cate blanchett. i m pretty sure that i prefer it to the original. it has great set design  acting  it expands upon the animated movie and has no useless gender or race swaps. if you ever have to watch one of the live action remakes watch that one
you should check out and compare how the japanese did peter and wendy as an anime.
i have watch zero of the disney remakes.  i realized years ago that they could never improve their classic work  and only make things worse ... and that s exactly what they did.in contract of the peter pan story  the robin williams   dustin hoffman  hook  1991   was a brilliant movie.  of course that was a tristar production and not disney.
honestly  i enjoyed the trailer. well...i enjoyed the comment section. close enough.
i don t know if it was put in place before or while  but when you and i were kids  disney had a standard line in all contracts they signed that gave them ownership  in perpetuity  of all art created by their artists. this included  but was not limited to  stuff like doodles on a cocktail napkin while at dinner with their families  and things drawn in the privacy of their own homes. this is where the company started to lose it s creativity  and ultimately led to it s susceptibility to the woke mind virus.
i ve been waiting for this reaction since the trailer dropped
also  i look back at peter pan and it s all about growing up. but for some reason wendy is in her early 20 s. of course she d be a mother-figure in the original story  she d already be a mother  judging by my surroundings.
100  agree. i haven t seen any of the live action remakes for the same reasons.
the comments section on the trailer is absolutely lit. if you need a little extra boost of laughter in your day. i would highly recommend sifting through the comments  loved the part where peter says  with great power comes great responsibility  while wendy tells the audience they re racist and misogynist. truly one of the moments of the movie  i really loved the part where wendy comes to the conclusion that gender really boils down to chromosomes and not some delusional affliction to ideology. when she put away her science equipment and made the speech that riled up the college students really made me appreciate her dedication to the craft  i loved the scene where wendy says to captain hook  did you know that despite being only 13  of the magical creatures  fairies commit 52  of the magic.  so eye-opening...  loved the part where wendy asks  what is a boy   and matt responded  a male child or adolescent of the human species   it was truly inspiring and brave.  i love the part where peter pan is teaching the children to fly  and wendy says  he can fly!   then john says  he can fly!   and finally michael  the youngest  says  our society is based on systemic racism!  brought a tear to my eye.
hook  finding neverland  and pan are my favorite peter pan movies.
the fact they called it peter pan and wendy is hilarious
looking forward to see the headlines peter  wendy gets praised by critics while peter panned by audience
you got through.  a lot of the reactions got blocked by the mouse.  you got an ad for disney tea at the end of the video!  you keep getting revenue from the enemy  -d    i haven t seen any of the live remakes either.  these started with maleficent and cinderella. maleficent  villian of sleeping beauty - for those that don t know  was a feminist dumpster fire  and the start of erasing fem  fatales as villains.
at least return to neverland made wendy s daughter jane the first lost girl using the word girl in the title.
i don t think there isnt a type of peter pan that hollywood can make that will be successful and interesting now. unless they do brom s child thief  which would have to be a series instead of a movie. one of if not the greatest take on peter pan
hi melonie thanks for bringing this out.i wouldn t had known that disney has destroyed yet another thing i rememberdwhen i was young.
because just having lost boys and sticking to the source material wasn t woke enough  they had to add lost girls... what s next  lost they thems
in that one moment in the trailer  she kind of reminded me of lucy from the narnia movies  was she ever on the dawn treader  it s been too long since i ve read the books or watched those movies so i don t remember  but maybe that s what you were thinking of there.
woulda like a prequel live action to hook that plays off the original story as well and adds more lore.
a live action already came out with robin williams and it was awesome
thank you
the actress who is wendy is the daughter of mila jovovich
but hook wasn t an adaption. it was more a sequel to the original story. interesting take on the concept though  and i can t remember how many times i watched it on cable back in the day.
@riboflavin folate  i heard the 2015 cinderella added some backstory and was the only decent live action adaptation.
@riboflavin folate  absolutely right.  a live production choosing to move a story forward in a fun and creative style.  what is was not was a live production rehash  f-up  of a favourite memory.
it s not peter pan and wendy  they are john patterson and monica
disney   you have a cash grab story making the villain sympathetic you say  writer   yes. it s about captain hook. disney   woah there. hook s a cis white hetero man. we only make women sympathetic villains.
@thatharvguy  honestly they would edit  they have
in the tinkerbell movie  they already had diversity of fairies. if disney decided to use one of tinkerbell friends  that would be better to go with pedro pan. yes. they voted for pedro.
it looks so good i m going to watch it on opening night on the imax ha ha ha
there is no edge in modern entertainment
one day disney will make an original movie again  and when that happens we will see abraham lincoln cruising around new york in a pod racer  from star wars episode 1 while listening to the beegees on the radio.  it s basically never happening againguilty admission  i ve seen three of these remakes.  the ones i ve seen were the jungle book one  the beauty and the beast one and the aladdin one.  if the 90s 101 dalmatians movie counts i guess i saw that too  and its sequel.  either way i do remember being very disappointed in the aladdin remake especially  the original aladdin is one of my favorite movies  and yeah while i didn t absolutely hate it i was still wishing they had a lot of stuff they had in the original.  that s the one i really wanted to be good  but yeah i ve only seen it once for a reason  the same goes for the other remakes.  i think originally i was just curious what they were like  or my sisters really wanted to watch it  but aladdin was the one i was hoping they wouldn t mess up...sigh.it really is puzzling  all disney seems to be doing with these remakes is make people appreciate the originals more  like aladdin for example.  just really don t get it!!!
i cant wait to see this peter pan in kingdom hearts 4!
glad i was able to see your reaction before its taken down by disney. they copyrighted almost every single reaction till now.
wendy is ever anderson   the child natasha romanoff in black widow . that s probably why she looks familiar to you.
melonie would be fantastic tinkerbell.
disney is just destroying a great childhood that i had into nothing  shame really
the entire point of the lost boys wanting wendy is so they d have a mother to take care of them  because boys are incapable of taking proper care of themselves and will never grow up without a mother to teach them how - this was a major issue in the story.  if there are girls among the lost boys  it ruins the entire premise of the group!  these people don t even understand the shit they rip off  how can you expect them to treat it with respect just another movie i won t watch  though a few youtube streamers will make a ton of money joking on it for their fans.
i think i watched the jungle book one. i have no real memories of it though. must have been great  d
my wife s nickname in high school was tinkerbell. she had blond hair  light skinned  and loved fairy-tales. geez.
you claim not to know much about the peter pan lore  but you re very familiar with the lost boys part. even i never remembered them having a group name  despite being in a peter pan play many many years ago.  looks like they re just going to be the lost children or lost kids now  i wouldn t necessarily call it  modernization   but just entertaining the possibility that there exist a group of kids that aren t just boys that never age.no worries  we still have the lost boys vampires and sudanese that couldn t possibly be tarnished.
let s see disney do a live action remake of the frog prince with anya taylor joy. i m daring you dizznee!
i m still waiting for disney to remake some real classics of theirs  like song of the south.
nice to see another aim to head fan.  didn t notice until i went to full screen lol.  but i kind of had the same reaction to the trailer though.
i can hardly wait to see disney s reimagining of melville s  moby dick.  i can see the writers switching ahab s gender  the new character is now named ahabia   mixing the races and genders of the crew  and swapping the  race  of the white whale  of course. and ahabia s vengeful motivation must also be changed. instead of taking a leg  moby dick somehow prevented ahabia from getting an abortion  so her monomaniacal pursuit of the whale is her way of protecting women s health care  as well as serving as an obvious act of white supremacy.
it s a totally different story from the one from the book and the animated movie
i love the part where captain hook wakes up with a horse head in his bed.
which animated disney movies have had live-action remakes  answer  yes
everyone does realize the book song of the south was to preserve the african music of the time.  it is the last big album of that music.  so they retconed it.  huh...
@imperial debauchery  fine.  remake it then.  but the book had the intent of preserving african songs.
@davis2737  i wasn t being serious about a remake  i was being facetious. disney has always been racist as fuck. their constant virtue signalling these days is a case of the lady doth protest too much.
when is melanie gonna give us bible night where she reads important scriptures to us like a church i m waiting for that hell i m not even christian
i m so tired of these clonic pamphlets and their complete disrespect for the work they are refering to  but it s an encouraging relief to see more and more people allowing themselves to speak their minds.
man  if disney actually wanted to make an improvement to the original peter pan movie  let nana join them in going to neverland!!! i always feel bad when she s left behind lol
the girl who plays wendy played young natasha in black widow. i thought she looked familiar.
gotta love the wokening lol rex said it best the whole special thing of wendy was she was a girl  and maternal figure
from the trailer it seems the peter pan movie has remarkably little peter pan in it.
i saw az talk about and saw the trailer. my goodness it looks bad. hey melonie. hope you have a good day
no matter how hard they try  robin williams hook will always be the best adaptation of peter pan.
saw you on camelot s channel. nice to see a sister in jesus on the platform. good work!
i remember watching peter pan from 2003  it was cool movie
if the lost boys also includes girls  then the lost boys and peter pan s relationship to wendy doesn t even make any sense...
so the reason wendy looks familiar is that she is milla jovovich s daughter.
that s not how honoring culture works when the history doesn t support it.
this is why i watch mostly anime and funny vids on youtube. most current american tv and movies are chalked.
disney obviously hates profit.  if they liked making money  all they d need to do is bring some of the classics back to theatres  maybe with a bit of an update with modern technology  but even that wouldn t be necessary.  people would bring their kids to see those  if not just to support them doing it.  parents want to be able to trust disney to keep their kids busy for a couple hours so they can take a break  but they can t do that if they have to screen everything first.
melonie you should watch the 2003 live action peter pan. it s the best one.
hook  had a diverse set of characters without losing the vibe of the peter pan lore.also  with tinker bell having her own successful franchise  you d think they d not mess with it. they wouldn t do that with  frozen  right ... right
you watched   wendel  tinkerbutch  lost boy girl 1  lost boy girl 2  and last and least peter pan   brave girl! way to take one for the team!
now that polish people are considered pocs  i can say that seeing a black tinkabell finally makes me feel included
problem is the new writers don t understand what the story is about  or if they do they despise it  and dilute everything down to a meek and weak adventuresque sitcom so swallow and woke no one will be offended  nor enriched  by
ikr would be cool and i actually am a christian
disney is literally burning down there own house
we need brozen.
exactly! and it didn t even feel forced or insulting. this is meant to be insulting and divisive.
gotta say i agree with you completely on these modern takes on classic tales   i ll pass on this movie
disney  exclusive  is the equivelant of  direct to dvd   i expect that amount of quality
after appearing in rescue rangers  peter never stood a chance against disney s gingercide.
but you re not all boys    so   omfg the woke
hi melonie just reject the woke remake of peter pan and watch hook or the live action peter pan movie from 2003 both good movies
au contraire mon cheri   disney plus just gifted us with a way to keep the xmen from keeping the name xmen in the movie title and team name. on account  that they just woke trojan horse itself with their peter pan and wendy take on the lost boys.
the minute tiny wendy parry s those two big dudes double sword attacks as if she was the hulk i almost threw my ps5 remote at my tv lol
melonie  i think you recognize her  because she looks a lot like her mom  milla jovovich. i think lol
wendy is milla jovovich and paul w.s. anderson s daughter. that is why she seems familiar. they are placing her in a part her mom would play.
that girl is the daughter of mila jovovich and she played young natasha in black widow.
lol  another disney failure incoming. btw  they also ruin wendy s character.
so  fun fact  if disney were to look just slightly to the side at their tinkerbell and friends movies  tink has a fairy friend who is black  why not just add her to the story
i think back to the 90 s when fox wanted to do a peter pan cartoon  but to make sure it wouldn t be confused with disney s they made changes to almost all the characters  not to the extent that disney is doing now  but they worked.https   youtu.be plgeh2iakhi
i had hope untilthe flag that was the girls in the lost boys when that kinda rips the entire story apart also you have tiger lily and he people there but i guess that s too difficult to be somehow unique
i like the part in the trailer when smee grabs the infinity gauntlet and says  fine i ll do it myself  absolute goosebumps
robin williams starred in a good peter pan live action adaption.
and of course when the pirates came in  all of em are whyte.classic
was the first live-action remake the jungle book   can t recall if it was that or alice  or if that duology was disney at all.  anyway  i thought it was pretty good  certainly not trash. one shudders to think what today s writers would make of a remake of the remake of the disney version of the jungle book....
yes  yes  inclusion is often a good thing as long as it is organic and it does not compromise the plot lost girls.black tinkebell...okay
like i said before  i m a black guy  and so if they remake like snow white  i guess i can apply for the roll and actually get it. my singing ability  actual sex  race and acting skills be damned
thank u! the race swap was unnecessary and i m black myself lol
they never race swap the villains unless it is to make them white.
maybe look on the cast list on imdb and you will see they are not all white
this seems more like  wendy  and a little bit of peter pan. you would think that the story would be about the main character  but it s not  it s about this other female character.  as in almost all the new reboots .
the wendy actress is milla jovovich s daughter  that s why she looks familiar. i figured it out even before looking it up to confirm it
i can t wait to see the cinemasins and pitch meeting takes on this garbage.
i think this film could be dramatically improved with karl urban as dredd.
amazon  disney  netflix  hbo... everyone is slowly following this woke pc line  which admittedly takes away a lot of the charm. they completely rewrite everything  characters you ve known or loved for a long time  whatever they are  are often unrecognisable. when are they going to realise that they are only serving a small class of people  p.s.  no wonder the actress was familiar. wendy is played by milla jovovich s daughter eva gabo anderson.
imagine watching disney in 2023.
i want to defend tinkerbell  s skin colour choice. as a fairy she flies under the sun most if the time in comparison with a mermaid who the sunlight hadn t reach the depth of the ocean.
i m actually surprised the lost boys weren t changed to lost people
the tinkerbell universe already has a black fairy named iridessa with a light talent. this version is unnecessary and dumb. aside from the animated version  i would say i preferred jeremy sumpter s peter pan and jason isaacs  hook as far as live-action goes. i do like the movie hook  too.
my god  look how they butchered my boy! . i m still gonna see it though  not gonna lie  i hope it s actually good .
i am not a fan of any modern disney media  but the fact that they own the alien franchise and are planning to release a new one scares me.won t be surprised if they sneak in some gender dialogue about the alien and someone says  don t assume it s gender .
benh zeitlin s wendy came out a couple years ago  with a black peter pan. the movie wasn t  too bad.
disney reaction videos need to start with writing down what you expect to see  and then ticking them off when  not if  they appear.
when they said in the trailer  why can t lost boys be girls  i cringed hard lmaoo
i ve recently started to watch russian movies  yes russian movies. i can t believe how different and unique those movies and shows are. about house wife  village and pandemic  family  real life issues  comedy and even kidneys where a girl needs kidneys. the pure fun entertainment i ve found after losing hope in hollywood. i absolutely love russian film industry at the moment.if you don t enjoy hollywood anymore try movies from other parts of the world there s a lot more fun and things to learn.
the last truly good live action remake of a cartoon. was the movie popeye with robin williams! that s how far back you have to go. the flintstones wasn t bad either.
there are already other live adaptations of peter pan  why do we need another
we are the lost  non-binary  ethnically diverse  genderfluid  boys of neverlands.  always hanging out with  peter pan.
i randomly watched 1994 street fighter with jean-claude van damme on tv yesterday  it was fun a   sh!t  but it made me realize something. all these live action adaptations and remakes of recent years are losing again and again because they are trying to make the fantasy too authentic  turn the fantastical into real  where the whole point is to use the surreal to boost your story and message instead they keep discarding it over and over again. it s clear with disney and their reimagined cr@p  with poor attempts at manga anime based live-action versions  most comic book to live action movies and tv shows or unnecessary life-support continuations of other big hit fictional worlds like that of star wars and the lord of the rings...
sun tzu. when an enemy is making a bad move  let them make the move
actually same it started with a random horror movie and then from there just more. when the guy said  hey asian girl you speak russian   i was like finally someone not being pc and speaking plain. the acting was kinda terrible but it was appreciated.
caught i am dragon  english title  a while back. it was completely awesome. so was viy 1  2  which is forbidden empire   iron mask. sure  they re hokey but oh what fun!
i know. american entertainment is so bad  that i ve started watching more foreign cinema as well.
@nathaniel thomas  there are sites like netflix. the movies are in russian language. but great movies with amazing cast and acting. like ivi  kion etc. i learn russian language that s why i can understand them at some extent. try to find             i ll live         fraud         kidney   elephant        money                   distant close . these sre some comedy movies. some of my favourite ones.
@redatex  i check it out. thank you
am i really that surprised not really i m just gonna play tomb raider anniversary on my 360 i m good glad i canceled my disney  last month
you know africa has stories about mermaids. i m sure they have stories about fairies too. why can t anyone at disney find these stories and tell them
disney is celebrating 100 but seems hell bent on making sure they never see 200
disney really is out to try to completely destroy their own movie studio and you know honestly i say at this point just let them.
the lost boys in the movie hook were ethnically diverse and it didn t feel like it was forced. plus the peter pan story already had good females with wendy  ticker bell  and tiger lily. doing these race and gender swaps were completely unnecessary  but they couldn t help themselves.
so basically this wendy is rei s little sister.  insert epithet here
who asked for this   why
i wanted to see the full trailer with sound. it had 34k thumbs-up and 252k thumbs-down. it looks like 34k people worked on the show.
i enjoy peter pan peanut butter but that s about as far as it goes. i will say this and i hate to admit it  but my second honeymoon the misses wanted to watch the live action beauty and the beast and i freakin loved it. i was dreading the thought of going cause i always just thought it was for the ladies. i may need to check me man card at the door.
from peter pan to peter trans. great job disney!
i thought some of the scenes looked good  but i feel like the original cartoon and hook had a certain clumsiness and physicality and everything didn t look so  magic  and glossy all the time
lets face facts  the movie is  wendy  but in fear of losing ticket sales  they shoe horned in  peter pan  at the start.
it s sad that they did this. peter pan was one of the very few films disney made that outreached to boys living in fatherless homes or in foster care. this was a film they could relate to. not anymore. it s disgraceful and a new low.
if you re gonna remake peter pan make it rated r  you have pirates  child soldiers  indian wars  kidnapped children  and evil mermaids  that screams r-rated.
wendy is played by eve gabo anderson - daughter of milla jovovich and paul anderson. i m sad to see her in a disney movie
there s only one peter pan  and his name is robin williams. may he r.i.p. also  why not buck the trend and go with the original version of the story  where peter pan would switch sides when fighting pirates and attack the lost boys and even  thin the numbers  out if they were getting too old. that d be interesting to see. pan killing his friends because of their age and his apparent disassociation with reality believing everything to just be a game. make that movie disney. in the words of ace ventura  i dare ya!
ok  is it me  or does the one portraying wendy look alot like suzy from the chronicles of narnia  the lion the witch and the wardrobe from back in 2004
a little lore about peter pan  so you know the original peter pan back in 1911 was black and had blonde hair and in the story he actually killed the lost boys for his sadistic glee
i grew up watching the 1953 animated film as a kid on vhs. another remake that s doa.
i get mila jovovich vibes from the actress  maybe that s the  deja vu
i never realized how attached i was to the original pete s dragon until disney remade it and ruined it.  these live action remakes are just a rinse and repeat.
so wendy is an expert fighter now.  able to take on multiple opponents with ease.  with zero to minimal training.  who does that remind me of   what was her name again   kay   jay   may
they admitted to buying theaters out right. so my family is just over this.
wasn t the whole deal with the lost boys and peter himself  in the original book  that they kinda thought girls were icky and useless  but actually they did need some sort of kind feminine figure in their lives this is just spitting in the author s face  but they can t fight back cause they ve passed away.
at this point i want white panther movie with a hidden futuristic city in alaska
disney doesnt wanna have to create original content  why create when you can recreate the same content thats already a success and make it better by raceswapping changing everything that made it a classic.
the burning dumpster fire known as disney is entertaining to watch crash.some people would probably not like peter pan if they knew the whole story behind the author
thats milla jovovich s daughter  she was in black widow as younger natasha
i m surprised that the haus of maus didn t pay the piper to pull this reaction down.
i m more interested in the neverland nightmare peter pan horror movie
i made a lot of the very same observations so i kinda just shrug my shoulders and walk away from it. i seriously doubt this will be the last peter pan movie since every few years somebody makes one. i m also not the target audience either...ultimately anyone who isnt the target audience really shouldnt be so rattled by it  just let it pass and be the relic of the times its obviously going to be in a few years...when the next peter pan movie drops.
atleast we are getting milla jovovich reincarnated as wendy.   it s her clone daughter.
so it looks like it s gonna be a visually great film. lol but that s about it.
i think its time for kids to go out and play like the old days.  instead of watching these dumb mind-rotting movies  they can play a sport  or cops and robbers.  that was fun back in the day.
i do reactions and i wasn t even in the mood to do one on this.
the del toro s pinocchio was real good compared to disney s dismal woke pinocchio.
for anyone saying the title of the movie being  peter pan   wendy  is a woke or feminist agenda by disney would be wrong. the novel was first published in 1911 under the title  peter and wendy   sometimes extended to  peter pan and wendy   then widely shortened to just  peter pan .
almost each youtuber who covered this new woke disaster got blocked.will we slip through the lines
wow  just had a look at the like dislike ratio  34k likes to 243k dislikes  another winning hit there disney  lol. i also don t need another live action version  we already did by spielberg  hook. a fantastic sequel story  where peter grew up and had kids  they get taken by captain hook  dustin hoffman  and peter has to remember who he was to save them. they didn t bother trying to change the character s look  the teen version had red hair  its just robin williams didn t  but he was perfect for the role regardless. also  the reason we ve seen the actress playing wendy  is that she was in black widow and she s milla jovovich and paul ws anderson s kid. she takes after her mother  a lot of the kids do.
the difference is that this isn t the 1st live action peter pan movie.
haha except its a step even further to the absurd. at least rey was an adult. wendy is a 13 year old who is apparently strong enough to outmuscle two adult men s combined strength.
the book says that girls aren t in the  lost boys  as they re  much too clever  and don t get lost.
looking for fun and creativity in games  might i recommended the yakuza franchise. the only franchise and game series thats damn right fun  hilarious and holds badass moments i highly recommend.
correct me if i m wrong  but isn t the point of lost boys is that they are all boys  and wendy is the only girl  who served as a mother figure to them  because girls were seen to be more discipline and mature
i recognize one face  that s millia s daughter.
and once again disney  they changed ethnicity from redheads to black with peter pan  really redheads became a new black in hollywood  and even more because they racesswapped tinker bell of blonde to black  don t even tell me if i m being racist   but despite that the guys couldn t have used   cgi to look like tinker bell putting the brilliant yellow tone  detail that there is a black fairy  the spring one - iridessaf rom the extinct brand disney fairies . and it shows how forced they are to put girls in the lost boys  and no  wendy and jane don t count   you can see it in the trailer scene  hey  are there girls  so what  . why is this forced  simple  because in the original  the lost boys never had a girl and a mother figure  until it came to wendy being a mother figure to them and you understand why they call the lost boys and concept too. and even more so that they are forcing wendy by seeing the trailer  the title  peter pan and wendy  you can see the shit
tanishabell is missing her tinkerdad
live action lion king  bit with people instead of animals.  you can use an all african cast  make mufasa as a great warrior  use perspective shots to make him appear as a giant of a man to simba.  do the same with scar  as these are larger than life figures to the young boy.
i don t think that they can do justice to the original story in today s social climate. gender roles play a huge part in the story. peter and the lost boys see wendy as a mother figure  and her maternal instincts prompt her to be the mother that they need. i imagine that we don t even need to say much about tiger lily and the indians.
disney s view of fair use changed for the worst!  hopefully your review method works!
omg  disney doesn t even understand their own lore.
disney s decline is attributable to the combination of dearth of creativity and woke politics. its a deadly combination and none of their new offerings come anywhere close to their beloved classic content. i m sure it isn t even worth the  2 ad supported add on to hulu streaming service. disney can no longer churn out the kind of hits it used to come out with back in the day.
the problem is that when disney are milking old franchises for every drop of cash they can  they don t have any opportunity to create black   brown or asian characters  so they just shoe horn them into european stories.
this movie is probably just about wendy by looking at the trailer
i ve been watching stuff from the 90 s for the last few years.right  now i m watching stargate-sg1 for the eighth or ninth time.i ve never seen any of the live adaptations of the classic disney movies and i won t either. already saw the best version why would i watch a worse one.
wait....there s a live action peter pan coming out. why! !
remember  under the woke dictatorship  disney cannot risk putting anything in their movies that might be upsetting or cause controversy for their modern audiences. they need to be as bland and watered down as possible.
i get chronicles of narnia  anna popplewell s susan vibe from wendy.the lost boys will just be the the lost. kinda like when they added girls to the boy scouts. now it is just scouts. progressives- where does it say it has to just be boys   in the title  boys scouts and the lost boys.
this looks like a movie
disney has become a professional at ruining classics. changing the races changes more than the characters  it changes the plot of the story.
it s the  lost they those  now! haha! dear god  just make it end!!! haha!
going off on what melonie said about the  what makes the red man red   song  odds on them making a white version
i might have to translate the what makes the red man red song and preform lol.
i would rather watch fast x over this  and i actually liked the fast and furious series up to them driving a vault down a highway.
the fairy looks like iridessa pretending to be tinkerbell.
what s extremely depressing is that african folklore  native american folklore  etc all have a treasure trove of stories they could tell.  just imagine a return to disney 2d with african style art  telling a traditional african story.  it could be amazing!but... no.  we get this instead.
i love how we have all these shows and movies with all black characters  but you can t have more than half white characters in anything now.
i thought it was just me. i forget these remakes exist right after seeing the trailer because there is nothing interesting to get me psyched. and actually watching the films is just 2 hours of your life you won t get back
i noticed that wendy isn t wearing a nightgown either  like she did the original cartoon and 2003 movie. this is just another effort to make feminine female characters masculine.
hahahahahaha just another to add to the never ending list of  new  movies i will not watch....once again thank you for your sacrifice by watching this so we don t have to you re appreciated more than you will ever know
as far as the live action thing goes  i ve seen jungle book and beauty and the beast and that s it. but i believe those were before the wokening and the coloring began. i honestly have no desire to see any of their new live action crap.
i certainly haven t watched anything. this is why i stick to books and anime  actual creativity there.
disney is just trolling everyone at this point.
guys  remember  take the er out. it s tinka bell
i am genuinely surprised  considering the history of peter pan adaptations in live action  up until recent years   that disney didn t have peter played by a woman -- so they could call it trans-rep.
they made sure they showed all the ticked boxes  race-swapping  a little girl who can fight 2 adult white men with absolute ease  lost boys have girls and identify as boys  and changing the tone and ambience from cheery to dark. typical disney moves.
last disney live action movie i saw was cinderella that came out 10yrs ago
as someone who has been waiting for a new peter pan adaptation  this is very disappointing  although i should have seen this coming .since 2020  i ve been very picky with what i watch.  i ve skipped out on so many things from marvel  star wars  and so on.  and i ll end up doing the same with this new peter pan.  in fact  i just cancelled my disney  and started rebuying the physical copies of the old classics.  i m just sick of this crap.
you 100  right disney gotten lazy furniture store different cultures tell everybody the same story over again
there are many different disney openings which include tinkerbell in the logo  so disney is effectively changing a character we ve seen since 1953. but hey  it racism if we notice.
i liked the trailer except the music was overdramatic. enjoyed the jm barrie book. been enjoying the disney classic remakes  cinderella  mulan  aladdin  lion king  jungle book.
lol they didnt even change the name of the lost boys even though they put girls in it now
i think you nailed it when you said that these recent movies just looks dull and boring. when you look at the past animated pictures  everything used to be very colorful and cheerful  but now it just looks super dark  monotone  and a fictional world that no one would enjoy being in
mila jovovich s daughter is there totally on merit. as wendy. yep. surname anderson. looks like the woman who played susan in narnia. curious looking. hmm. edit oh yeah  she was young natasha in black widow  y know the scene where there s a reaallly dubious juxtaposition of smells like teen spirit with the ummm matchmaking of the youngsters with their new families. by organized crime. dudes.
the only modern disney remake i did do like is the jungle book in the mid 2010s  but i hazard to add it s been years since i last watched it. maybe things in the dialogue or imagery will pop off the screen immediately now it s easy to spot these garbage messaging in entertainment. speaking of the lost boys  i m still shocked that woke hollywood hasn t raided that classic teen horror film the lost boys from 1987 since it s all  white males  and  boys  in the title with 98  all males in the film! heavens forbid what modern hollywood would do to that film. trust me it s on the cards at some point. i ll stick with the classic peter pan animation film from 1953.
lol i saw this and looked up  generic movie trailer https   youtu.be kaodjqyg37ai got treated with auralnauts  my favorite makers of parodies for my favorite franchise of all time  star wars. they know how to parody properly xd
hook is the one and only real peter pan movie. robin williams is the goat.
anyone wanna bet that this will be wendy andpeterpan
that s the core of the issue here  there is no creativity or joy it s just a product and platform to push an agenda or empty virtue signals. people wouldn t care as much about changes if they at least made them fun and entertaining  but that s not what it s made for. it s not made for the audience it s made for everyone but the audience  so it s no wonder these companies are hemorrhaging money.
disney truely has no new ideas left. why did we need another freaking peter pan  and it looks so dark tone and lifeless. nothing compared to the orginal or the 2003 live action from universal. i love peter pan and the story of windy and the lost boys. i agree that western media is dead. this is why i still mostly watch anime.
wendy actress is the  milla jovovich daughter  you  know  resident evil  leloo dalas
that s why i closed the book on disney  they offer nothing for me now  the only reason i keep xd around is for yu-gi-oh and beyblade.there s nothing left just some dust and wire.
the actress reminds me a lot of susan from narnia  so maybe that is what you are thinking of too.
i was just eating peter pan honey roast peanut butter and crackers when your video popped up! they re watching! as far as this new peter pan goes who cares  there s been so many versions over the decades at this point what difference does it make  in my opinion anyway  thanks melonie!
the original peter pan   a story about growing up   accepting the notion that you can t stay a child. the new peter pan   wendy   a story about how staying a child is somehow virtuous.and its no longer the  lost boys   they are now the   lost theys.  and wendy now can defeat multiple pirates with a sword super easy  cause  women empowerment fantasy.  all the good guys are diverse   all the bad guys are whte  cause of course they are. what a joke. just more woke propaganda from disney. as i ve been saying for years now  disney  hollywood in general  does not want to entertain  they instead want to indoctrinate people  especially kids  to their insane woke ideology. and notice that they won t make original content that is diverse  they have to take pre-established franchises    diversify    wokify them. this proves that its all about indoctrination.
them adding girls to the lost boys makes zero sense cuz wendy was kind of like a big sister mother figure to them due to her being the only girl they ve seen in what i assume is pretty long time but of course disney has to pull the diversity card a ruin the whole point of wendy and the lost boys.
everyone is worried about all the race swaps  but no one is worried about if they ll change it from a crocodile to an alligator.my 2 centsthe best peter pan was robin williams.
surprised they didn t call it wendy and peter pam.
i won t be too hard on this. since it doesn t even look terrible. but  i personally believe yara shahidi is terrible casting for tinker bell  even if i don t mind the race swap. also  doesn t the tinker bell lore have black fairies  why not just make yara one of them
this trailer made me laugh so hard they cant even follow their own lore. enviroment setting it looks cool but idk lol. i only watched aladdin cus its my favorite animated movie will smith was actually good as geniee in it imo. but the rest feels un inspring like a brag. the settings looks cool but overall it dont hold up the whole movies.
that ain t tinkerbell that s blackbell
how come it s impossible to keep races and genders as they are always been stories...
because major production studios have set a mandate that said all protagonist groups in all movies going forward must b racially diverse. i imagine disney won t even greenlight a project now if it is a mostly white cast.
@ryan cooper  that s total bs.. and the way things are now.. i ve started to see races and genders everywhere... not cool
as a cuban puerto rican im furious    i loved peter pan!
the era of peter pan has come and gone.  it is based upon a popular london play a hundred years ago.  it is a story of young death  where in the 19th century london was the fastest growing city due to the industrial revolution  and the number of abandoned children and infants were horrific.  out came this play  the lost boys went to never never land  and they fight pirates  and have a good time with each other  it is lost child heaven.  tinker bell is given to peter pan as a helpful magic fairy  and wendy is a mother figure.  this was outstanding and popular for the stage show.  in psychology  peter pan is used as an example of the boy who never grows up  and doesn t take on adult responsibilities.  captain hook is the antagonist  and he is fighting against time  that the crocodile represents  and time will devour the captain  he is a full grown man with responsibilities  and a career criminal.   disney has gone woke  and all they can do is wreck an old story  if they don t honor it  people can read and know the difference.  i don t see how it can be updated  except be remade  because it is based upon early twentieth century london  england  culture when child death was much more common.  woke-ism believes that they are invulnerable and can imagine anything to be reality  and it is possible that the real message will be missed by this 2023 disney.
honestly  i feel sorry for the kids who are going to be seeing the negativity toward them being race and gender swapped without truly understanding the anti-whiteism going on today in our culture as the context for those negative comments. i blame disney for using them as pawns and putting them in this spot already knowing the backlash is coming.
tinkerbell looks like iridessa from the tinkerbell movies xd
i just don t care  the magic has left the kingdom long ago. walt is spinning in his grave so fast that if he was connected to generator it would solve the worlds energy problems. surprised that disney has banned your clip. have a wonderful day mel.
up next  a martin luther king biography  and having kevin sorbo play mlk.
interesting  that a studio famous for a pirate film franchise  where even the villanoius crews were diverse  has decided to portray this lot as completely white...
this truly is another level of box ticking. nothing wrong with literature but these days publishing companies are censoring books for sensitivity reasons. not all literature is good and some do have some strong words and descriptions shall we say. to re-edit them is a disgrace. now peter pan gets the same treatment. not the biggest fan of peter pan and nothing wrong with the original animated film. this isn t for a modern audience this is for a tiny group of people that shout and rave on twitter. not to entertain just push their agenda and poison families. it s a very  very mad world  and i want it to end. i don t know how much of this bull i can take.
enjoy the video while its up. dizzney going on a blocking spree
this is pointless to race swap. especially when disney already has a black fairy in their catalog.   iridessa.   they should ve just used her.   it s like rippa said.  they don t have faith in their existing black characters.   that is telling and sad.  whose the racist   they should ve made this a sequel and brought in iridessa as the main fairy in their movie.   as i understand it   iridessa has her own set of special abilities  too.
everything disney is now just different incarnations of brie larson face.
they need to stop saying  modern audiences .whenever a movie is promoted as being  for modern audiences   they are literally alienating probably half of the audience or more with their woke catering changes and choices.they need to start saying what they really mean   for  progressive  audiences  or  for woke audiences  maybe. i am here in the modern day. i am a part of the audience. these movies are not for me. none of these  for modern audience  movies have been felt at all like they were for me or anyone like me such as my friends or cousins.
i m half black and half mexican and i never liked the race swap between characters if there s no reason at all. especially if it s from a certain are that has a certain race or like the story came from a certain culture. i don t need a character to be the same race as me to see myself in that character. i ll even say this but seeing ariel and now tinkerbell being black  ngl it really doesn t sit right with me at all. like i never liked woke crap at all and can roll my eyes  but this feels like it was really forced in just for the sake of  diversity  as if it s being disrespectful.oh and of course they had to add a girl in the lost boys. literally feels like that one little sister who wanted to join her brother and his friends and mom said he had to let her in lmao
hook can not be beaten as a peter pan movie ever
i agree on that poc should get their own original characters for diversity. not getting hand-me-downs leftovers from white characters. how uncreative has disney hollywood become where they can t or refuse to make original   interesting characters movies shows for poc
can tinkerbell be the be-witch that is was in the movie.
i wouldve laughed if they made the three siblings a different race and never address it  anything for the diversity!
the only reason disney doubles down on dei and the gay trans ideology is it s a major profit driver. i m willing to bet that almost none of their leadership sincerely believes in supporting these people. it s so easy to check a box if it makes money. casting someone different is a piece of cake for them  no sacrifice whatsoever. bonus points for them if they spite their political enemies. they already know they re losing their original audiences  who was everyone from boomers to millennials. if disney doesn t move on from those generations and sink into the  new way   they ll die out  so they re doing this as insurance  let s call it. and if they can simply repeat their franchises  they don t have to spend their energy being creative  for a change.all about the greed.
of course there s one thing we ll never see in this one  now you know why the reeeeeeeedd maaaaannnss rreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i can t help laughing because in attempting to score diversity points they ended up insulting women. the reason there were no lost girls is because girls were smart enough not to fall out of there prams. i agree with it just being boring. i never watched any of the live-action remakes. not for any ideological reasons  but because i thought if i want to watch the lion king i ll go watch the lion king. it always boggled my mind why anybody would go see these films  even if they were perfect shot-for-shot remakes. as for the race thing  i honestly don t mind race-blind casting as long as it s not agenda driven. if you just want the best person for the role that s great  but that is clearly not the case with this. how do i know  simple  the pirates are all white men. where are the women pirates  where are the black or asian pirates  oh  right  the pirates are the villains so they can t be diverse. it s so obvious at this point that even the liberals are fed up with disney s ham-fisted pandering.
will the madness ever stop  the lost  they them theirs
the original perer pan was feminist enough  clearly showing how girls mature faster than boys  and women civilize men and set the standards for behaviour.the entire point of the lost boys is they are a bunch of kids who don t want to   are afraid of growing up. tinkerbell and wendy are constantly looking out for the boys showing them good from bad.this movie with all its race swaps and forced agenda is like the proposed lord of the flies remake which got shelved. it just doesn t work.
we need diversity  let s write and add a great black character into this story.disney   no  we re not that good at writing and i doubt an original black character can be popular. just piggyback a successful white character. tinker bell! wow we re so smart.
you are awesome!
too bad this wouldn t be released in theaters  it would be fun to watch it flop.  peter pan according to the actors page is indian  middle eastern and latino i think is what s listed for his ethnicity. but yes woke is extremely boring cause none of the original songs  jokes  creativity etc.
if you want live action peter pan.. just watch  hook . there it is. that s it. just watch  hook .
the good news is that it s a great time for those of us offering alternative entertainment. people are so fed up with this crap. they want a good story  not a  diversity  demonstration.
tinkerbell might not have been a redhead but peter pan was so they still race swapped the ginger. now their going after the blonds between this and their pinocchio remake. peter pan being mostly white   with some native americans   made sense given the time period   country it was written in which was 1900 london england. there were not a lot of black people living in england during the early 1900 s. also the type of fairy tinkerbelle is based off of is a european version of a fairy.
wendy s actress is milla jovovich s daughter
for live action  cinderella is beautifully done with more character for both her and prince kit and maleficent was an interesting take on sleeping beauty!can t name a single other live action remake that s actually good from disney.
they can t pay me to watch this movie and mermaid 1
looks like they lightened the actor that plays peter pan. he s a darker shade of diverse  more like new namor. look him up.
setting aside all the other problems with this movie  i have a question about race-swapping tinker bell.  is it  racist  to object to race-swapping very famous characters   what should we think of a black luke skywalker   a white guy playing  black panther    how about an asian george washington   a red-haired othello   how about an eskimo version of  apollo creed    i guess i must be a racist.
i watched the trailer the other day trying to give disney a chance but sadly like always they ruined something that was already good. turning it woke
literally destroys the whole concept of the lost boys
i really wish disney would just go out of business. it s a shell of what it once was.
it is incredibly insulting to black people to randomly shoehorn them into characters where they don t belong instead of respecting their culture enough to make projects based on black culture.
return to never land animated movie which featured adult wendy and her daughter jane is more faithful to the peter pan source material than this live action remake.
there was a good reason why the lost boys were only boys. and it has to do with wendynow they removed her purpose there ... good job disney.
why do they force racial politics on non-humans  elves  pixies  faeries  mermaids   the 2011 syfy neverland had a better take on the lore.
peter pan is only a red head in the disney cartoon. he s not in the book or in other adaptations.
@msanjelica  i know but since this film is based on the cartoon he should have stayed a redhead.
@father pucci  i don t know if they re sticking to the cartoon or going to go more with the book. the title is more like the book. hard to say.
@msanjelica  it also seems to stray away from the book in a lot of ways too. maybe it s some mix of both
@father pucci  maybe. the editing was a mess.
@msanjelica  the film is too dark and grey looking.
@father pucci  that s the popular filter these days  isn t it  i don t know why. it is really drab.
@msanjelica  i don t get it either.
oh i forgot pete s dragon  although i guess it s not the same since the og was still live action. the new pete s dragon is very sweet and i love elliott s design. both the og and new are fantastic.
jungle book was okay in recent years. everything else has been trash.
@jonathan devereaux  eh  it was watchable. good casting.
nope. it s only  not racist  when they are swapped from white to black.
yes
run home jack!  hook hook give us the hook!
peter is indian  the lost boys are diverse and inclusive  tinker is black and wendy can sword duel with two adult pirates  who are also milkie . tiger lily will prolly be siberian.
woke disney s latest live action remakes of animated classics   snow white and the seven uygurs  101 booster shots  sleeping biden  lady and the trans  genderella  peter panned
i was thinking the same thing at that 8 00 mark. that s where it gets really sad  they use these minority actors   actresses as kinda like cop outs
ten bucks says the actor who plays peter will make a very random tweet about being trans cuz peter can be either! yassss!
the title feels like someone penciled in the  and wendy  part.
maybe we could get marketing together with the data team and some focus groups with some esg planners to do some split  testing on this and get the executives to weigh in on how to pivot to a sustainable consumer journey through synergistic integration of the fairy tale s core compentencies with circling back to the new normal....what mel   boring you say
this film is a complete fail. i was surprised when i saw tiger lily because  for whatever reason  i thought they wouldn t be showing the indian tribe at all. but now that it seems they are  i m betting there s going to be a throwaway line about colonization  probably. the  lost girl  moment was dumb  and immediately lost me. admittedly  the actress playing tinkerbell does look very beautiful in that brief shot  but she just isn t tinkerbell. overall  this is going to be garbage. classic peter pan is the definitive version for all time.
disney has lost their freaking minds.
the only problem i have is tinker bell just because she looks too nice. why can t there be los girls i feel like it makes sense. peter pan can be any color. i don t care. i just wish his hair was a different color hair dye exist.
the thing that makes me so disgusted with disney s incessant race swapping is that it s quite clearly done to purposefully make people angry. i have began to wonder why the anger is worth more to disney than actually making money on their movies .because this isn t about representation. african folklore has very rich and interesting characters which could easily be adapted into a commercially successful character for disney but they insist on taking characters from scandinavian folklore and making them black or hispanic. they aren t making their money back on these movies and tv shows and they are quickly and quietly sent straight to streaming services or cancelled after one tragic season. i can t help but wonder why they keep making them .is it because they started production on them back in 2020-2021 and it s too late to pull the plug  it s it because they want white americans to feel hated so that they vote a certain way  is it just incompetence from the execs
is peter pan played by a latino  should i thank disney for their bravery   now i can relate to this fictional character not because he s written well with values  growth  and development but because... he has the same skin tone as me .
jungle book was really good.
maybe we treated pan harshly...
in og peter pan lore the lost boys were called that because girls were to smart to runaway to neverland. so no lost girls
peter pan movie okay  where s he at
to its credit at least the lion king remake didn t race-swap anyone.
i could eat taco bell and nuclear shit out a better movie than disney has put out lately
you know they know they screwed up with they have a fake posting under multiple accounts exposing their love of conversation never spoken in the trailer. so it was a disney person puking out about 50 different   loved the part...  posts.
i liked the part where tinkerbell wore black face and the lost boys didn t have penises.
i ll watch  hook   starring robin williams  on blu-ray  instead.
wow that first wendy shot looked like marilyn manson ....
when will corporations learn not to bend the knee    thanks for saving us money!
if they renamed tinkerbell with tamekabell  i wouldn t miind.
me as wendal   but you re not all boys   so! me   okay  negro twins  that s why your parents gave yall up twice
if you are craving for some masculine movie   rrr   is the movie .
disney lost all credability  lol
i feel like when you go into something with such a negative mindset it s clear that you won t enjoy it
this could have actually been a good movie  if it was made ten or so years ago. all they can do now is destroy things.
i m totally looking forward to  peter pan  neverland nightmare   from the same people who made  winnie the pooh  blood and honey. apparently  among other things  tinkerbell is an addict and got really fat.
wow i cant wait to not see it!
they did a good job with aladdin aside from the complete butchering of jaffar and the script change to jasmine. really will smith carried the f out of it.
peter pan 2003 was the best live action movie
they did it again lol.
cant wait for black panther 3 with ryan reynolds being the new king of multicultural   diverse wakanda
the comments in the video are so legendary  d
seem  like people in hollywood lost there inner child being to serious.
she prob... reminds you of her mom   milla jovovich
melonie mac that part when the chief was dancing that was me and my dad s favorite part that chief was getting down
if i want to watch peter pani will watch the originnal cartoon film
hook too
@black recluse  i liked hook too  however i didn t like maggie she was so annoying
the art of war. practice it or don t
disney is trolling us
disney and marvel are destroying characters from our childhood. if i was an investor i would immediately take my money out before i lose it  because at this rate they will lose billions
i m done with disney
we already have a live action peter pan remember hook
disney might do better laundering money then making movie s now.
looks like this movie took a second to the left  and straight on until failure
i think if they really cared about diversity they wouldn t race swap characters from european stories  but they would do more tales from other cultures and actually try and do them welli hope hollywood and other groups that have become lazy  complacent  untalented and everything they accuse their critic s of being mainly all the ists and phobes they call everyone when they display those traits more usually and care more about ideology then entertainment or whatever else collapse completely so we can good entertainment again
disney fired all the good writers  the hacks they employ can t develop good new stories.
i want to know why they swapped iridessa for tinkerbell and why there is no native american or indian fairy
my favorite arguement against black washing characters is all the red heads they black wash while keeping them redhead.   obviously you didnt need to change much other than their white skin and nice features.
tinker-bell   is  a fairy!
if you want to watch a peter pan movie watch robin williams in hook. it would be more entertaining than any modern show.
i wonder how your  mr. sheeefieeeld  sounds
only live action that i enjoyed was the winnie the pooh movie  not the horror
disney casting yara shahidi as tinker bell really hurt you huh
but there is a peter pan live action... its a bit old but it still holds up and looks highly superior to this....
girl looks like she could be playing  iridessa not tinkerbelle.
long beach griffy  peter pan should be gay and asian.disney  write that down
i ve only seen the jungle book  aladdin and beauty and the beast. i liked the jungle book  and aladdin was ok. beauty and the beast was the exact same movie as the animated version.
disney has lost the disney magic... they used to have a special charm to their movies   shows...
in 2008 there was a movie or a series about tinkerbell and her friends and one of her friends were black if they wanted a black fairy make a movie about her or something just saying
disney is going lose a lot of money and i m happy for them.
disney live-action remakes done
if it is from disney   then the name of the movie is pedo-pan
think of it this way  disney is creatively bankrupt and the modern audience is easily entertained by shiny things.
blackbell. tinkerbell s sister from the hood.
what you don t realize is that disney has lost china audience  now they are after india audience!
the only live action disney movie i liked was cinderella
as of 3 2 23 at 3pm mt  the trailer had 33k likes and 256k dislikes....  rofl
i think i ll stick to watching an actual peter pan movie . it s called hook
...if the focus was story...they d focus on the story...
regardless of her race  the actress does look good as a fairy
i kinda wish i didnt know about this.
disney is pretty much out of ideas except for checking the boxes.
actually .. tinker bell was a red head  the robin williams peter pan  hook.
the  lost thems
wasn t peter pan directed to boys more than girls  but this is directed at ..no clue
disney is so hell bent on race swapping every original character knowing that they actually have an animated movie or cartoon  cgi of tinkerbell s friends knowing that there are many races in her group of pixies. disney does not want to make a movie about them but yet they want to race swap everybody and act like they never existed.  tinkerbell had friends make movies about them i mean how fucking hard is it
the only positiv is that they filmed it in the faroe island.
how long before disney blocks this on too
how is disney still going on lol
the actress that signed up 4 this is to blame too....
tinkerniqua bell she s from detroit she lived in my old hood on 7mile and vandyke
people forget that the movie hook existed....peter pan was a middle aged man  tinkerbell was a grown woman who had the hots for peter and grew up with him as well  wendy wasn t there  ect ...this movie isn t a big deal.
cinderella live action was love  because stay with original story. however  studio should stop with remakes because no one not interested.
i saw the original peter pan and i saw hook i don t remember girls in the lost boys.........kinda kills the name
as a ginger  i don t feel represented anymore.
so   peter pan is an english puerto rican
you know it isn t wrong to say that society has  lost girls  today. very likely they re sending a message they never intended to send in that.
ah well at least i can save some cash
honestly  i ve never even heard of this movie before. disney must be giving up on marketing this crap lol
wendy and the lost non binaries  blinker bell and aladin peter pan ain t gonna work.
i m not watching this until we get leslie jones as tinker bell.let it all burn.
reaction band peterpan - bintang di surga
i think disney needs a good dose of boycotting.
thank god we have the cartoon movie peter pan in time you want nobody asking peter pan movie disney can you do any original or you are the ideals
disney has destroyed star wars  the little mermaid  peter pan  on and on. when will they learn they are causing more harm then good !
i ve watched the stand alone tinkerbelle animations with my daughter. there is already a black fairy her name is iridessa.. couldn t just use her in a new setting  i think ill keep avoiding new disney its woke trash.
wendy .... well of course it is.
it s funny how disney created a black fairy iridessa
can someone explain to me what hollywood has against redheads
the money has to run out eventually  right
i swear i was subscribed to you about a year or 2 ago ...i had to resubscribe just now
so far  you are saying so much by what i see you holding your tongue
i don t watch any disney production movies  tv shows   disney land and such . but would use there toilet paper . but it  would have to be woke to mickey and minnie s  and unisex too
why does disney have no new ideas
peter was the redhead they swapped out..
not interested in watching it  but it s cool seeing milla jovovich s kid in a fully featured role. sounds like she should have worked on her accent a bit more  though.
they changed the name to peter pan    wendy ... the agenda is at the forefront.
...the little mermaid s in peter pan...
they really did use every trailer cliche. feels like they desperately wanted it to look good  but it looks awful
man  disney is really hatin  on blondes and redheads lately. what happened to inclusion
i m eagerly awaiting race swapped tarzan
the only d..... live action  mostly cgi  i have seen was  the jungle book .which was ok.
how!what makes the red man red
looks more like lost they thems than lost boys smh.
allow disney to go broke. when they hit rock bottom  maybe they will change  not.
i think the only disney live action movie that was good was the one with robin williams
they need to quit ruining my childhood
sometimes  by the way you look into the camera  that s all we need to hear to understand the real-real on something
the original book from 1911 is called  peter   wendy .
hook looks like a better movie
when the hell will these people learn
why was peter pan ridding a horse   he can fly faster then a horse.
gender or race swap doesn t matter if it doesn t hurt the story like baxter stockman. i m the ninja turtles of the 80s he was white and later on became black  but it didn t matter. these days they are forcing it at times
misses every mark. doesn t feel right  doesn t look right.
disney is known for their animation. what a show they turned into.  the whole point of wendy was that she was the mother figure for the lost boys  got them away from that world  and back to the real world.  tinkerbell in disney world still looks like the animated version... hmmm.
oh oh  disney might block this video
obviously it s now peter pansexual   the lost they them.
unfortunately i watch aladdin and the lion king. right after i watched the live adaptation i immediately watch the original. never again will i watch the live adaptation again
critical drinker  modern audiences  incoming...
it s  the lost they them s
they will say  its racism  when it flops.
i have no idea why they keep regurgitating vomiting up everything that s already been done instead of creating new characters  new stories etc
just don t hate watch it also  vice went l o svu gay with one of their tweets. guts theme sold separately
the only live action peter pan movie worth anything is the robin williams hook movie i loved that movie as a kid
peter pan... more like peter pander.
the lost persons who self identify as boys
melonie mac where the heck is captain hook
peter pan is hispanic in this movie lol
first ariel  now peter pan. i  as a redhead  am sick of being race swapped and not represented in disney movies
yeah remakes r sad
oh yeah i never watched a single one... specially nowadays
is it tinker-bell or tinker-balls
they may block your reaction like others
is it just me  or did that just look like suzy cide  know what i mean  we are in hollywood s cringe era.
she is the milla jovovich daughter....speaking of equity etc i call it nepotism
more money disney will not get from me
you need the  return youtube dislike  plugin. the vast majority of people who watched it did not like it...
hillsong united - i heart revolution album
ahh yes. tinkerbells glow irradiates from her dark skin... she is a flying blacklight... facepalm
tinkerbell is disneys most recognized mascot next to mickey mouse. apparently this must have been problematic. because why. just because it wasnt brown ofcourse. so now these people will feel more at peace with disney like shaking hands with old friends surely right. the original writers and characters should ofcourse be ashamed. for um. for being white ofcourse. but now its corrected. because they are brown. they obviously took issue and made a point of it. and they will now care to not hate tinkerbell and co oh ok. im just confused why captain hook and co arent brown or wearing grass skirts tossing spears theyre renowned seafarers and pirates. oh i always imagined barely teen ladylike wendy has girlboss powers and can easily defeat multiple armed pirate ruffians. is there a modern ru fi ooo i wanna see the black girl trans version boss of the lost boys thanks to enlighten us disney. because the traditional works were plainly istaphobic and rachist right but not this
there is only one peter pan movie i will watch. that is hook
tink s friend iridessa is black! all her friends are different race!
peter pan and tyrone
i foresee...a disaster....
how is this a  100  million production   we ve reached that point in hollywood where everything they make is starting to look like a syfy movie from 2006.  is 99  of their vfx work done from remote workers in india now   i just dont get it...
so peter pan is indian now
disney just took away a great old classic cartoon movie and make it into a real bad real alive movie with real people in the new peter pan movie and i think it s going to be going down the drain for good and i don t think that it will survive the ratings for this year or next year and it will not get any awards for best picture or best cast for the characters in the movie. anyway i just hope that it doesn t come to it and i will not ever see it in the theaters in future and beyond. anyway i just want to make a comment about this video for today and i just want to say that it will go down in history for awful and bad movie ever  ok melonie. anyway i am so sorry that i missed your stream show today and i hope to make it again next week sometime when i am not busy with babysitting and other stuff like that  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great day tomorrow  friday  with your mom and watching the movie of cocaine bear  ok melonie. anyway you will laugh at the movie but you will think that why they make a movie about a bear being high on cocaine. anyway enjoy the movie and enjoy your time with your mom too melonie. anyway have a great evening and good nite.
yeah so
i think you should be tinkerbell
hard pass from me
btw peter pan was always woke. hell was played by women in thousands of plays and  shit. it s a perfect opportunity for disney to get woke asf wit it
imagine destroying your own ip s
it s got like 2 million views with only 35k likes. ouch
and why are they using such a dull  dark filter  the animated peter pan was bright and colorful. neverland is an imaginary world and should be colorful. they could ve done a juxtaposition with  dull  reality in the beginning of the film.
i refuse to watch the lion king live action. also  aren t they doing a disservice to girls by making them into  lost boys   i heard girls were made to be too smart and accepting of the responsibility of growing up to become lost boys or something like that
how awful of you  disney!
peter pan super fan
peter pan and woke.
if you ask me  they didn t race swap it enough. they all need to be south asian. think bollywood people!
they should make more warcraft movies. and i liked van helsing from 2004. it was stupid and hilarious. they could make diverse igor. that would be nice. but all their remakes will fail.the little mermaid has at least 150 million as budget. i don t see how this should make it s money back. it needs at least 600 million.ant man 3 made around 400 million atm  i would bet it won t make the 500 million. the first ant man with far cheaper tickets made over 500 million. it had an 130 million budget  not 200 million. so with 500 million  disney would get 250 million  while investing around 400 million. the 150 million they lose  that would be a whole movie budget. they are in huge trouble. same with dc. black adam made 400 million. ended up with around 250 million instead of 190 million as budget. so around 450 million to 500 million investment  but just 200 million back. at least 1 4 billion lost. and black adam wasn t something like aquaman and the turd.they are in trouble. all of them. they could have an easy time with remakes. just make it 100  like the animated version. if you really want to have remakes. maybe it would be better to improve the quality of the animated version.all the ideology stuff is stupid. they still could stop and just entertain the people. even with their highly damaged brands. especially right now  it s not that hard. mediocre stuff like top gun is enough to make huge money  because all we get is bs. and they would have enough stories to tell. i see potential in movies from games. warcraft  or starcraft. the stories are great  you could make starcraft into something like starwars. it isn t that much work to take a great game with great story and turn it into a movie. if it s about inspiration  they would have a lot. if it s about representation  just look at myths. great stories. worked out with northern myths  too. if it s about history  what about people like king mansa musa from mali  richest human ever  what he had would be worth at least 400 billion dollar. he caused huge trouble with a shopping tour in egypt  because suddenly there was so much gold  gold dropped in worth. so kings in europe had huge problems  because their gold suddenly was worth nothing. it caused wars. but for king mansa musa  it was just a shopping tour. he didn t want to harm people. so the richest man ever  and he is poc. and the story is hilarious. but sad fir the people 700 years ago. but isn t that a great story to tell in a movie  they did it with alexander. with hannibal. i just don t understand  why they continue with destroying franchises for their agenda  because if they want money  they shouldn t change it and make new stuff. if they want representation  they could make the same thing they did with people from europe or northern africa  like alexander  hannibal  or with gods like thor  and do it with kings and gods from africa. what s their problem  education  perhaps  not knowing anything about ancient religions  culture and history. funny  not knowing about things they want to represent. i can imagine  it s insulting to be in a country in africa  to see some crappy adaptation of the cultures there  to see some black actors  and to get told  that s you. that s representation for you. and that  while you know  african history  the cultures there  it would have so much to offer. the world would like to know. 7k years of culture. myths. kings seen as gods. all kinds of environment  dschungel  forests  deserts  mountains  with a lot of different cultures. powerful nations. scientific success. the first heart transplanted  it was in south africa. imo it s lazy  it s stupid  it s ignorant. hypocrits. that s not representation. representation would be something real. that s just lazyness  a way to feel good  to feel morally superior without doing anything for that. first they make up a fake problem  representation. now they solve this fake problem  poc actors. so their brains give them some dopamine. it s like an addiction. it s like fast food and sugar. they figured out an esay way to feel better  so they do it. they could earn it with success and real work. but they make up problems to solve them  destroying or changing what they consider bad  instead. they are weak minded. a lot of them is addicted to things. they are used to the respect  hollywood earned in the past. all the money. but most of them got it like jennifer lawrence with harvey w. no talent  just corruption and thinking  they deserve something others earned. sad and pathetic. and to make it even worse  they change others work. successful people. people that worked hard. even people like tolkien. i really hope  they learn  what they do will just lead to the destruction of their brands. disney is 100 years old. destroyed in the last 7 years. their nw dropped 45  last year. they will go broke  if they continue like that...
this might sound.... well..but isn t tinkerbell supposed to be lighting things up  that s like alot of her thing  becoming bright yellow or white. how is black skin going to light up a lantern   just saying  p
don t understand why disney takes all these great classic cartoons of theirs and make live action trash.... have you seen the peter pan movie made by cbs back in 2004 that is almost dead accurate to the old cartoon and disney can t even do better than that or anywhere close
it s peter patel and the non- binary persons now.
there s only 1 peter pan and that s robin fucking williams in hook! thank god i was a 90 s kid!!!
i ve been black all my life and not once did i like a race swapped character. is it so hard to come up with original characters and stories
the lost boys having girls and not just tinker bell but the title isn t peter pan it s peter pan   wendy film like people aren t gonna call it that name we just call it peter pan cause it s simple. bruh the changes are so unnecessary just stop disney cause your gonna waste your money in the end and they should have casted tom holland as peter pan cause i think he would suit that role
nope  just nopesorry disney i won t let you ruin this for me i ll pass
they are getting rid of all the red heads.
shes mila jovovich daughter
hollyweird and disney are just plain lazy these days they don t even try anymore its quite sad.
a woke re-skin. lol
these type of movies should just be ignored and or given a honest review. but i myself am just tired of the agenda and horrible writing going on. having such a small percentage of people be in control of our entertainment is foolishness. why not find a competent studio who is willing to find mature seasoned writers who haven t been indoctrinated make movies  if a studio is know to be agenda free and we support them then we can all just let the hollyweird studios die out. hw doesn t want to make new characters or write go stories and at this point is just insulting.i m woke  woke   having my eyes open to the lies and bs that is going on  not asleep at the wheel or having your brain turned off to the facts only to allow false information into it  yes i m taking the word back. they took the word from us to avoid unifying us against this evil practice. it went from not being able to say jesus to not hurt other people s feeling who follow other religions. to us not even saying jesus or god for fear of being cancelled or having youtube delete our account. they want to make what s wrong right. and the first to go was our religion that at minimum kept our countries values in check then they directly attacked our religion and now the focus is our kids.
i would rather watch the original cartoon or hook.
this looks like a copy of the pan that s on disney plus already.
ok so since they already have girls in the lost boys  what the fuck is wendy even doing in this story
i don t know why peter  an anglo saxon boy  and tink  a blonde fairy  are both indian.
tinkahbell and patel pan
5 09 the stereotypical bad white pirates...
how many more of these before they go bankrupt
this is another example of how lazy disney has become. what do they have against the stories of africa  arab  asian and hispanic stories  do they think that those cultures have zero stories worth telling
im surprised peter pan wasn t gay
the girl playing tinkerbell is super hot  but she aint tinkerbell.
to be fair  i ve not watched the trailer  nor do i plan to.  from what i see here  it doesn t look like a cartoon doesn t look real   live action . the best thing i saw was the big rock stickin out of the water. hard pass.
true
istg if they don t make tiana white-
add lost girls to the lost boysdiddid you just assume their gender !
they found the most obnoxious precocious children they could find.
but wait there s more look up marvel mcu sentury
captain hook is terrible  disney forgot the number 1 rule in story telling  your story is only as good as your antagonist which made the original live action peter pan movie  hook  with robin williams and dustin hoffman so good. the hook in that movie was so good that you almost felt bad for him in the end.
bad news you claim not to want to watch the movie but you just did.
early 1900 s england...  i wonder what the racial make up of that country in that time period might have been
if they re gonna do the fanbaiting thing and completely rework the property to fit their narrative  they should have to rename the property.  this should be called peter pandering and woke wendy.  so over this crap.
man  i thought phase 4 was the new low for disney but holy shit. this takes the cake literally fuck 10 seconds in and i make a i hate this movie like oh my god
if they ever remake sound of music maria will be trans and captain george von trapp will be a villain.
disney just turned off the comments.  those were the only entertaining aspect of the trailer. darn.
watch pan  2015  instead
modern audience  redundant meaning the following day!
i think that s mila s daughter
of course they keep hook white lol
the original nick fury was white but now he s black.
admit it. mickey was never a mouse. he was a rat to begin with.
why didn t they race swap tigerlily  i don t feel representative in that character
what a surprise disney turned off commenting  lol
redhead_actors_matter.
the only live-action i watched was beauty and the beast  against my will     xd . i tried to watch mulan  but got bored within the first ten minutes because of the over-exaggerated highwire stuff. the rest i had no interest in. with this version of peter pan going straight to disney   it s telling me that they are losing faith in their movies...and finally copyright striking people further proves they are desperate.
watch hook instead
then they need to race swap the princess frog with a asian or white actress.
just another drink water comment.
this is going to get copyright struck
peter pan and wendy .what s next  hercules and meg  pocahontas and the oppressive colonialists  how about the gypsy of notre dame disney lost its magic when it decided to go woke. in going woke  it has gone broke  not avoided doing so. when it stops hurting men and women everywhere with these remakes  the magic will come back.
for modern audiences  just translates to  lacking in creativity   originality  at this point.
the only good remake at least to me was christopher robin.
i mean i like the one with robin williams that was a good one compared to this dumpster fire
this trailer makes me want to rather rewatch old classic disney peter pan or like old days live action movies with peter pan or even version with adult peter pan with robin williams. they all were way more entertaining than this woke fest. tinkerbell now being black doesn t even shine bright. tinkerbell was known for being gold hair  bright skin  shiny gold to point of almost being unable to see her shape. now it s like dim light dot flying around characters.
love you
the wb peter pan movie looks better
she right about the race swapping
let s go hypothetical- think glows.. right  so wouldn t ur skin be more translucent n not as pigmented    looking at fire flies  the part that glows is translucent  so wouldn t it logically make sense for think to be less pigmented even in the hair ergo - think wouldn t be black.
disney has lost it with this modern foolishness they re doing. i m over all of these remakes
who gives a flying shit about what tinkerbell looks like  that s not what s ruining this movie  as long as tink isn t ugly i don t care. there are many versions of tinkerbell in disney live actions  where not one of them looks like the cartoon tinker bell. can we talk about the fact that they put female lost boys in the group  or the fact that they made wendy a fighter  i see so many issues with that  it ruins the importance of wendy  especially with how special she truly was  it was also in great contrast to the rowdy boys  and poised wendy  who even though enjoyed having fun  was still more mature in comparison to the boys. what i don t like about the fighting is that it genuinely wasn t wendy nor her nature. what made her so pleasant is that she didn t have to fight  like the boys did which still made her just as immaculate in character. plus it kind of gives off the feeling that being feminine is a problem. also peter s acting felt off. kind of wish they could have kept the child actor who was in pan  but i m guessing he s too old. i m genuinely not happy  at the same time i liked the graphics so i m still giving the movie a chance  i just genuinely wish they wouldn t change so much.
its just so dumb. idk that is  but i know it s not peter panthe entire message of the movie hinges on wendy and the lost boys  lost boys and girls arent caoable of delivering the original message. but thats probably intentional
disney making everything black is soo weird and somehow people think that s good progression.
notice they didn t race swap the villains.  they can stay white.
and this is why i am gonna go play the legend of dragoon now because i had enough with hollywood bull crap i will harpoon or volcano disney ass and turn into a dragoon and do astral drain disney ass
disney is finished!!! another woke movie with black tinker bell and girls in the lost boys!!
hmm... so we have arielle  we have allegedly snow white and now tinkerbelle... just a coincidence im sure. not that i have a problem with the actresses  but was it really necessary  i mean  why  why was it necessary was there something to prove  i don t get it...  why not an 5 0  asian prince eric  or and 6 5  norwegian aladin  guess i m just not getting the point...and i suppose the fact they did cast alyssa wapanat hk as an actual indigenous actress as tiger lilly was just a lucky  coincidence   must be...i mean  can t be they are  true to character  selectively  right  that might get an weird undertone doesn t it
bollywood neverland.
i don t get it ..  why does it matter
when these european fairytales were written africa had no written language at all. the saddest thing is stealing other groups culture and not telling your own but the literally can t tell their own.
at least tinker bell is a girl
sees disney s new brickjawed wendy darling and pajeet pan  what is...that   urge to watch hook intensifies
the jokes write itself when an arab and a black woman comes illegibly at night  in your house  to steal your children
doesn t jude law know he is better than this  somebody needs to tell him.
peter pander
maybe peterpan is gay  he s a lost boy  trying to find herself.
that  so  comes from being told your race and gender makes you special and important for the past decade  the smug entitlement is obvious.
im rewriting amistad  but all the suvs are white now.
do you have any tattoos
but wait... there s more look up sentury marvel mcu
agreed with the race swapping and gender swapping needs to stop. on that note never really cared for peter pan. i haven t watched any of the updated stuff except cruella. don t know why they thought putting out three movies back to back with the race swapping and gender crap was going to be a food idea.
peter pan sexuel
that lost boys scene is so forced. ovcourse disney makes them majority poc and women.. nothing wrong with more representation. but anyone who knows disney  knows exactly where their head is at when they made this movie..and ovcourse they blackwashed yet another iconic character tinker bell..i swear disney needs to go bankrupt.
there s just no life in these movies anymore. i mean this is so dull and dark and lifeless. compare this to robin williams peter pan  that movie was full of life and pure joy  with bright greens and reds and yellows ..this colour scheme is black and grey .
wtf has disney done this time like i don t understand why are they doing this this is literally being racist  i don t know how to take this cause i grew up watching the originals and now they change everything like why someone explain to me cause i don t get it at allll.....
watch peter pan from 2003 instead that one is much better than this and also it seems they have just done that story again but with diversity this time
i mean peter pan takes place in london. so the race swaps dont make sense. having some of the lost boys a different race didnt matter because the boys couldve been picked up from around the world. even if they dont have red men is red song the movie hook had a diverse cast and did it fine. in fact  peter had left neverland in the hands of a specific lost boy that happened to be black. you didnt see a bunch of white people in outrage over that. the contrast these days over race and sex is very annoying. i thought the movie hook did very well. robin williams was great. the lost boys were all boys and portayed their child like behaviors very well in hook. that movie was even a sequal of sorts. the actual lore behind peter pan is pretty dark. he kidnapps kids bringing them to neverland never allowing them to grow up. i think hook was one of the ones that got out and grew up coming to take over neverland or something. many disney films had dark backstories. they were adapted to fit a young audience. not always to fit a specific racial or gender audience. there were some racial or gender influence among films but the feeling was so small compared to what they push today. like many girls were into princess movies more than boys. that doesnt mean a boy couldnt like the movie they just probably didnt like it specifically for the princess. even the red men red was 1 scene among a whole movie. to kids of that era seeing a person dress up in native american indian attire seemed silly. you dont see people dressed like that everyday or dancing around a campfire like they do afterall. even most native americans today dont dress like that anymore. its no different than genie being blue in aladin as most depictions of genies are in their mythology. most people forgot the scene where jafar kisses a kidnapped jasmin. thats just sickening to hear and see but it proves how evil a villain jafar is. he is willing to go to any lengths to get what he wants and is willing to abuse anyone or anything that he can to get it. whether thats jasmin as the princess or genie for his magic powers.
hey you can t assume they re girls okay
how about casting anya taylor-joy as storm in the new x-men  make her character south african  and super-racist.
punjabi pan
it s starting to look sus that they turn at least one white girl black per remake.
junglebook is only decent one
they sure remembered to make sure capt. hook was still white  wonder why they did that
melonie it s these lost they them now
the new lion king wasn t really bad but this looks super leftists made
i see live action remake i don t even bother. they are always trash.
my generation has hook!tinkerbell is the latest to fall victim to tokanization.
when they don t follow the main story  this is what happen. they need to stay with the source material to create something  like the movie hook  with robin william. this was a good movie with the peter pan universe. this movie look like dogshit...
another movie that i won t see.
another movie that me and my kids wont watch.
first a black blue fairy than black arial now black tinker bell smh. disney needs to stop
honestly  the cinderella remake was the only decent one because it was before all this  woke  thing became a nuisance. the rest are all crap. although i did like the jungle book remake but i was also a big fan of the original.
wow  that looks awful
they should have race swapped all the red skins as well. also  where are the black and female pirates
make original shows then they can have all black or lgbt characters but of course they go after iconic movies and stories because of marketability
new ideas seem dead.
to be fair peter pan has gone his whole theatrical run mostly gender-changed ie sandy duncan and various others on broadway. basically  the lead was trans. i got nothing for this and no interest in it much like then.
who is going to watch this though
care they copyright striking people that s react
they did the same thing with little mermaid with the  epic soundtrack  trailer music and that  trailer sound effect  that i don t know how to describe in writing lol. why ! this is not a marvel action movie. not every movie has to be huge epic drama. meh  this is going to be a massive failure just like everything disney. disney has no talent anymore and they can t come up with any new ideas. first it was  live action remakes   and now all they can do is  race remakes.  i ll watch the original animated films if i want  too bad disney has butchered them so badly on blu-ray  or just watch something else entirely. disney s not getting any of my money anymore.
remember kids always pirate your marvel and disney movies
didn t know this existed until yesterday. still don t care.
the lost they them
completely over anything that race or gender swaps  no money fo youuuu
if bob chapek was bad  bob iger is even worse  at least when bob chapek was in control the life action remakes stopped for a while now with iger in control his once again is trying to shove these poor quality life action remakes in our faces!
this movie is a nah for me  i rather watch skippy and jane
the 2003 peter pan movie is a better adapatation than this abomination. the lost boys had no girls in their group  wendy was kind and brave  hook was really scary and cool  the action was fun  the music was sumptuous. everything is great in the movie. even in hook the characters are respected  except tink who is too joyful but the rest are ok.  wendy in the new version is like mulan in her live-action film  perfect at everything and boring. thank s for ruining her disney
you re clearly losing it. i pray for you
neverland is meant to be a magical place. wheres all the colour gone  it looks so plain and boring. disney need to drop this agenda bs. people want to be entertained and if you re gonna do a remake stay true to the source material. nothing wrong with a diverse cast but come up with new characters and a new story for them.
tisha bell
2003 peter pan is a more accurate live action than this shit
elves are primarily european and northern in origin   they would not be very dark skinned   all that aside are they really this desperate
the only peter pan live action worth watching is hook with the late robin willams. rip mr. willams.
does disney pander to black people with all these character swaps yes but the only reason it s a problem is because people afraid to change the norm everything was all fine when all the main disney princesses or popular characters where all white women just come out and say you don t like seeing black girls or women popularized being queens princesses hell even a fake fairy lol
it feels like disney channel is running the remake operation lmao like maybe one is good  and the rest are just shitty half assed garbage i don t even think the race or gender would matter if the movie was good changing ghe dynamic might be interestingi personally could care less sometimes in an audition it just clicks and i think it s okay if the gender or race is different it is a remake after all so i expect changes however if the end product  like almost every modern disney remake  isn t even good then why even make it at all
the only good la remake was cinderella
ariel now peter pan and tinker bell   wtf is going on with disney   make new characters with their own identities   race swapping is just stupid
tinker bell isn t black
disney getting so annoying
when actual gen z gets into the business of movie making then maybe things will change. baby boomers and millennials thinking they know what the new gen want is embarrassing and shouldn t be praised in any way.
no thanks. i ll wait for the peter pan horror movie that s coming down the line.
i can see boring. i mean  there s like a billion peter pan movies out there.
penny pan and the lost non-binaries.
couldn t agree more. never land is supposed to look wondrous  why does this look so dull
sometimes i wonder if disney goes extra hard with the diversity and inclusion here to hide the fact that they try to hide black people in their chinese market offerings.
why does the film look like it was shot by zac snyder  where s the color  where s the vibrancy that a kids film should have  it s just drab
peter pan was written by a scottish playwright and the story begins and ends in west london. this is cultural appropriation.
oh no......... peter pan is the latest victim.........what happens when thay run out of original media to destroy
all new disney content is screened by my 7 year old niece  if she doesn t find it entertaining  i guess all never watch it. i have watched original mulan  toy story  lion king  tangled and finding nemo over a 100 times. i still haven t seen lightyear as she walks away from the tv when it starts. when your  modern content  can t entertain a 7 year old go back to the drawing board.
thankfully i ve hated everything disney since the 90s so i have no interest to watch this to behin with...
is captain hook transgender or is peter pan  someone has to be confused about their body parts.
why do they keep the bad guy white and why don t they make it a black woman if they need to chance stuff
worst thing about the trailer is not wokeness  it s blank generic  zero catch to watch a new modern verison that looks like any random netflix teen fantasy.
screw disneys peter pan tbh.... the only version that was good in my opinion was hook.... rip robin williams
watched dumbo  b tb  lion king  the jb.....yeah  not worth it. all my patients were spent watching the crash called rings of pander. no more. no thank you.
it all looks bland in tone too. a bright red headed peter and blond tinkerbell would ve really stood out
esg has destroyed american entertainment.
it does look boring. tho only live action remake that i like was mulan because they did a good job on it  however the rest suck!
oh but if you have a problem with race swapping movies little mermaid peter man etc  you are deemed a racist.
well if you really want a horror movie i think the closest you going to get is once upon a time because in that show peter pan was a dick
@wolf bane  naw  there s a legit pan horror movie in dev. in it  tinkerbell is chubby and addicted to coke.
i think race swap is just lazy.
they should ve gone like the musical and have peter pan played by a woman...but that was mary martin and sandy duncan and they sold it..... i don t buy any of this...
reduce the size of your facecam.seriously  i m not sure if you want all eyes to be on you  or the topics you discuss.
isnt it intresting how the trailer devotes all its time to women  and zero time to men  o almost like they are pushing some kinda woke agenda
so stunning  so brave  so diverse ...typical hollyweird.... why do people even care about disney anymore.
this movie must ve been greenlit in 2019  it looks so dated already... the wokeism feels so moldy by woke standards. edit  the development of this crap began in 2016! it took the production team four years to write the script lol
if zelda was a disney movie zelda will be black
disney stop screwing with the old  classic movies the fact is your  violating movie rights of the people who  made before you were born ok you need to change your name nature and conduct immediately or go out of business immediately who s with me on this  i mean disney come oooooon your making us your customers look bad and angry understand....................even godzilla is ready to nuke your business  till it glows at night.
girl what s your issue with race swapped
if you go back and watch the movie hook... there was diversity there... this is unnecessary.
a tiny little girl holding off grown pirate men with fighting skills is so dumb. even for kids. peter seems like a little dandy now. that s to be expected.
why make new stuff when you can bastardize the old classics and just change the race and gender of the main characters!walt disney is turning over in grave right now
i can t wait to not watch it and be called a racist !!
thats not tinkerbell and its stupid. these people do not care about money because they know this movie is going to flop
lol   i don t think changing tinker bell s race is gonna diverge the film in any way  . not everything is  woke  lmao  . at worst. this movie will be generic as hell
i m not a big peter pan fan. peter pan   wendy trailer reaction looks very woke   very bad.
if you want to make an adaptation while also including a diverse cast  maybe don t adapt something that doesn t have a diverse cast. if it s specifically a lack of white people you re after  then adapt something like mula-fuck
there s only 1 race swap that is acceptable to me  and that is nick fury in the mcu.  i ve hated every race swap in everything else i have seen.  i hate gender swaps even more than race swaps.  put race and gender swaps both together and i want to forget the existence of that particular franchise
peter should ve been a lesbian.
the title is weird   peter pan   wendy...  this feels like a feminist bait move. just  peter pan  is fine.they wouldn t do cinderella   prince charming... it would be just cinderella.
and gannon would be white with blonde hair and blue eyes.
@stankey poosea  and link would be a gay boy and navi be black
we know it has the message but damn! this neverland looks such a bland and boring place. if peter pan took me here my response would be  take me home ya nob
another mythical character from disney isn t played by a white person let rage   cry about it
hey pretty melonie  yep we are so tired of disney woke and modern audience stuff it seems disney  is willing to lose all its money as long its narrative or political agenda is ok. i get all the inclusive stuff is fine but why not created new characters instead swaping race is so hard to do.
and still missed the mark...if you wanted to go full woke why not name it  peter pan and tinkerbell ...because she is black...smh.
i could complain plenty about the woke agenda of the movie  but honestly  just looking at the trailer as its own thing. it was boring. uninspired. stupid at times.why is that all they showed of hook  i could barely see him and he didnt look interesting.peter didnt seem interesting  almost nothing shown the trailer just tried to show too much that it didnt have focus. they were just selling it on the fact that its the story we have seen plenty of times so you will surely love it.
i hope the new disney peter pan movie flops massively!
just wait for julia roberts being cancelled because her play of tinkerbell. and why is peter not a transgender non-binary person  sarcasm on disney execs are exclusionists   they should be ashamed    sarcasm off
live action would be okay if it wasn t for this woke garbage casting
i m just so glad they didn t gender or race swap the bad guy  best to keep him as a white male!
i want to like this because i grew up loving peter pan but this is just objectively bad  cringe  and woke.
erbell
lets take another british fairytale and force diversity into it.. and then not call it cultural appropriation. that seems like par for the course. right
stop fackin caring about peoples feelings  maybe there should be a word for fear of cancelation. could have been better  do better disney.
it is the standard disney reimagination tm  trailer shit. darker  grittier  dramatic  ... lacks everything that the old movies are. so yeah this will be another dark gritty bleh remake that ..do i need to say more
sadly another woke bs disney movie ! no wonder disney turned off the comments .
stealing from the past because original ideas do not exist anymore
disney live action remakes becoming a just snooze fest for me for a billion dollar company like them that supposedly have a tons of animator and character designer team   which unfortunately their presence seem to be shifted away because of investing time and money for not so important  live action remakes project instead an outdated lazy raceswapping hack for the sake of marketing strategy   what about go back to animation department and create a new character   i feel bit skeptic basically disney live action are just an overrated expensive special effect show with mediocre  writing
jude law as hook looks awful
i call her tinkerblack. tinkerbell is white  has blonde hair and blue eyes. idk what that affirmation action diversity thing is  but it s definitely not tinkerbell
you re preaching to the choir  sister.  nobody wants to see these cashgrab woke remakes.
what do you do when you ve run out of ideas 40 years ago ...do the same thing ...raceswoop...and try to convince the public...there getting something new ...this isn t about rep .or inclusiveness...its about selling us old bread with a new crust!!!!
they re not ashamed because at the end of the day it s not about making money it s about the message. it s about the ideology it s about you know whatever they want to push gender and communism.
@wolf bane  i probably should have added  sarcasm on and sarcasm off
i call her tinkerblack
i haven t seen a single disney live action remake yet. and i don t plan on seeing one. they have to do the dumb race gender swaps and go from really colorful and unique animations looks to just bland looking live action with probably overpaid special effects. also disney is just bad all over with their woke agenda.talking about gender i will hopefully finish destiny 2 lightfall tonight. they have a dumb they them surfer dude with the lines written for a teenage girl . can t wait to never hear his annoying autotune voice again.
i really thought there was gonna be a valid critique but your talking points were racist from the beginning
i m mad  they kept captain hook white. not enough diversity!!!
remember when white washing was an issue in media  now it seems  insert non white race here to replace white character . like they have a black female princess  tiana  the princess and the frog  so why doesnt disney make that a live action movie  then they wouldn t have to race swap characters for no reason. idc if it sounds racist  i dont think characters should be race swapped or gender bent. make original characters if you want to m ake a movie about a different race or gender than the movie youre making is.
black washing
excaly this reace swapping is so overtop they reaceswap white characters to black but if it s other way round it racist what s next cowboy movie with black cowboys
i think you really hit on it  these movies are so boring!! besides the race swapped feminist bs  they are boring movies. ughhh!
thats what i think. boring
one more big flop is coming!
why does this look so bad  it s bland and generic so much so that you could mistake it for something else
first off people think peter pan  again  it s like tarzan or robin hood  it s been done so many times already. secondly  it s a woke version with gender and race swapping  so that s even worse. thirdly  all these live action disney cartoons are pretty much failures.
i freakin hate race swaping.if you want a black or hispanic or asian character  just create new original stories instead of stealing an already existing one.hey  what if we make a new black panther movie but the main character would be white!no because the character is black and not white  same for every already existing character whatever there race or gender.
i wait for the remake of viking tv series only with black people!
never seen such a boring captain hook in any of the previous versions  he s always been a big character who jumped off the screen. in this jude law just looks monotone and dull
peter pan looks so bland  what a forgettable actor they chose for the role. the entire movie looks dull.... just woke garbage.  how can you get the lost boys wrong when boys is right there in their name...... i ll stick with the peter pan cartoon which walt disney himself worked on because he actually knew how to make entertaining movies.
no thanks.
yah i can t wait for a asian luke skywalker and his black sister leia. and don t forget the non binary darth vader  who transgender to a robot. i can t take disney serious any more.
the what makes the red men red was highly racist melonie. i m a huge new fan of yours. so i would appreciate it if you don t cross that line being a proud native american.  we are native red men  savages or indians. we have faced enough devastation in all the world. so if you don t know that 400 000 000 natives were killed. that is the worst holocaust in history. so yes we take it very personal. that slike them singing a song about black faces  n word  or slaves. you just dont do that. i m not about this movies at all. i think i saw a native girl in here. i will say disney has gotten better with being considerate about races. so i ll be happy they don t put that old racial song. having the lost.bous wearing feathers. our regalia and eagle feathers is four our ceremonial and traditional purposes. it s not for anybody s costumes. thanks if you take the time to read this melonie. your content otherwise is so awesome and on point. you and others have given me more inspiration to start my youtube page!  i ll be under dark corners with deaven
go woke go broke
well they had make tinkerbell black because it was an agenda. see little mermaid is black so well we gotta get tinkerbell black  tooyou see it doesn t really matter but just think if mulan was played by jenna ortega or something.  we could probably bitch about that wit better reasoning.  but honestly  tinkerbell was historically white and well kids are not gonss really know the character because they only go see the new one and in the end disney s gonna lose money cuz shit don t add up.
uhh they already did that. they made one of the jarls  black woman
o god  everyone pray for the matt welshes and mloniue go boom throwing tantrums over fanasty movies while 800k kids go missing every year in america. fact
