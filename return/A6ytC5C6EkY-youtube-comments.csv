you have such wonderful content. I watch every night while Im cooking dinner. but the thing I love most is you got me interested in reading my Bible. or getting into it more. Ive been starting plans on me Bible app and reading listening every night before bed. when I heard you say a prayer to somebody in one of your recent videos I was so awestruck because that does not happen by many influencers or youtubers at all. I gained so much more respect for you after that. I love that you are not afraid to share your faith with the world. it also makes me feel better and  like I said  start reading my Bible. thank you for being real and awesome.

dont forget that youre not alone in this.  plenty of people who want to support your videos. and let s not forget your amazing appearance on fnt. lots of people like them and you fighting this fight and we all appreciate all of you.

I really appreciate you mel and for your encouragement. I would like to pray for you over this  I fully get it. I have been in my head a lot lately  however  the verses you have posted lately have been huge reminders for me and God has used you with those timings so thank you. you will continue to be in my prayers it awesome seeing how God is using you. stay you!

I think youre doing a fantastic job. your spreading God s word  and you have inspired me more times than I can count. or remember. unfortunately  the internet and youtube and places are not always the friendliest place to be. I just want you to know that I think that youre doing a fantastic job. keep spreading God s word please if you feel that is your calling. if youre confused about that just pray and God will let you know. God bless you and your family and friends.

I am equally excited and scared for the future of tomb raider.  I want so badly for it to be good but am terrified that they will continue to ruin lara croft.please never stop sharing Bible verses!  this is so great and encouraging!

I read the Bible for the first time last year  and the main takeaway I found is that nothing in life is guaranteed except the presence of God. and the peace that brings my soul - I cant control outcomes  sometimes things just wont go the way you think they should  and life is very unfair and unpredictable  but God s presence remains and he is the one constant. love the verse of the day!

God saves his toughest challenges for his greatest warriors. know that you are serving him! I know because a few weeks ago I was at the lowest I have ever been. you spoke about how reading your Bible has helped you and how it takes work. so I started to read mine again and within a few weeks my life has changed. God showed me my path forward and healed me. I wasn't going to share because its a very personal thing to share in the internet but I want you to know you are making a difference!

I cant type. I meant to say the perspective but you knew that. I do think its more cause she's leaning forward  but to each their own. great job on the channel btw. love they Christian tie ins and how you stand up to the wokies. God bless.
