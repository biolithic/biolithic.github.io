like most sane people  i prefer female videogame characters to look more like lovely melonie than dove s landwhale
rest in love  lara croft.rest in power  jensen.rest in honor  garrett.square enix threw these three franchises into the gutter by selling them to embracer group.
if amazon can disrespect a franchise like lord of the rings i can t imagine what they ll do to tomb raider.
enjoyed this video  this was a great delve into the state of tomb raider. glad you re not letting it affect your peace anymore either. good stuff
if she doesn t have her iconic dual handguns  i m out. taking away her handguns is like taking away batarangs from batman. you just don t do it.
means nothing without good story telling.
i m happy to hear that tomb raider is safe  for now   melanie  as a lifelong sonic the hedgehog fan  i know what it is like to fear for are franchise s future.have a happy memorial day weekend everyone  and god bless you all
you look fantastic melonie. love the yellow and cool necklace. i hope you re doing well today. and i hope you have a great weekend. i never get tired of hearing you talk about lara croft. i love how passionate you are about tr and lara. love ya. your friendship means the world to me  melonie. take care melonie
wishing you and your family a wonderful memorial day weekend  melonie      and as always  thank you for all that you do sometimes i wish i could give more than my normal  5 or  10  but ultimately it s not about money... it s about the support behind it. and i hope you know how genuinely fantastic of a person i think you are  and how you re one of my very favorite people to support because you strive to be biblically correct - not politically correct. thanks for always being such a winsome inspiration and light  and also for being the best source of tomb raider info i know. god bless you richly  melonie
i feel the same about the ff7 remake. yes it s called ff7 but that ending really killed it for me
hey melonie  i know this comment is off topic  but i m posting it in as many places as i can that i feel people will understand it.why i boycotted thor     by  albertthis isn t simply about nudity  i want to make that clear. i don t have a problem with men or women getting naked on film. you ll never hear me squawk about the magic mike films  or ryan gosling doffing his shirt in the notebook. now if you ve gone off on an tirade about women being objectified  then i m going to call out your hypocrisy  but the scenes themselves i take no issue with.this is about the context of the scene  how it s depicted  and why it s happening. in this specific case i am refering to the recent disney release thor  love and thunder  and the scene in which an apprehended and restrained thor odinson has his disguise  and every other stitch of clothing   flicked  off of him by zeus  while hundreds of other mythical gods look on. based on what s shown in the films trailer  his female companions jane foster  and valkyrie apparently opt to do nothing to help thier companion. instead the duo simply sit back  eat grapes and and take in the view of their friends helpless and humiliating circumstance.what this is  in actuality  is a male victim of sexual assault being played for humour  and it s disgusting. on top of that it s in a pg-13 film  a film about a comic book character  a film that will no doubt have many young people in the theater  children  boys  seeing the grown-ups they look to for mentorship laughing  cheering  whistling  and chirping as this male character has his clothing ripped from his person  without his consent.  i wonder what sort of message that will send to them i ve watched well over 100 reaction videos to this trailer showing this footage and a censored shot of christ hemsworth s buttocks  and with the exception of about a half-dozen of them  everyone reacts to thor s abuse with everything from mild to hysterical laughter. i guess for some reason the degradation of a male character  even if he s a noble hero who s saved the world  500 times    is just too dam funny. well it s not funny to me  or anybody else whom i would consider to be principled.this of course isn t new  it s been around since at least myra breckenridge came out in 1970. it starred raquel weltch in the titular role  and it would change my perspective on the world forever.in the film there is a scene involving myra  the recipient of the world s greatest gender transition surgery  ever  who had returned to her home town  as a doctor  and a local football hero rusty godowski  played by roger herren  who is in need of a back brace. to that end dr. breckenridge had him strip and restrained him to the examining table  claiming it was to keep him from moving while she traced him for the brace. myra s true motives were both far more devious and deviant  as once she had mr. godowski compromised she informed him of her true intentions   i m going to ball you rusty.   she told him  revealing herself to be wearing large dildo on a harness.what followed was  to me  a sickening display of a man being violated. rusty had made it pretty clear that he wasn t interested  but myra proceeded to do her thing anyway. everybody watching seemed to find the scene hysterically funny  everyone but me. even at the young age of 13 i was well aware that what was happening to this football player was wrong  and if the roles were reversed i doubted anybody would find the scenario comedic material.this is what is now referred to by many as a red pill moment. that moment in your life  not unlike neo from the matrix  when you become aware of how the real world works. in my case it was the rude awakening to the fact that it was acceptable to use the abuse of men as comedic fodder. other examples of these types of tropes include  40 days and 40 nights  2002  the lead character matt sullivan  played by josh hartman . wakes up to find himself being raped by his ex girlfriend nicole  vinessa shaw . the wedding crashers  2005  jeremy grey  vince vaughn  wakes up to find himself tied to the bed  with gloria cleary  isla fisher  sitting on him. after a brief verbal exchanger she gags him  and the camera fades to black. the next day jeremy tells his friend about the  midnight rape  he d fallen victim to. my super ex girlfriend  2006   when her boyfriend breaks-up with her g-girl  uma therman  shoves him into a wall with super-breath  domestic assault   burns the word  dick  into his forehead  aggravated assault   trashes his car  vandalism   uses her superspeed to strip him naked at work during a work meeting  sexual assault   and throws a shark through an apartment window at him after sex with his new girlfriend  attempted murder . real funny stuff  when the victim is a man.  get him to the greek  2010  aaron greene  jonah hill  is charged with the task of getting aldous snow  russell brand  to a concert  during a stop along the way aaron is assaulted by a young woman named destiny  carla gallow  who is one of sergio roma  sean combs  groupies.  that s my boy  2012  in a flashback scene donny  adam sandler  recalls an encounter with a school teacher  mrs. ravensdale  ana gasteyer . the issue with this is that it s a much younger donny  justin weaver  which leads to him being the center of a statutory rape case. all in the name of comedy of course.this last example on my list comes from what most might consider an unlikely source  a 90 s family sitcom called blossom. this is actually more of a comparison between two episodes one from season 4 and another from season 5. in the season 4 episodes  let s talk about sex  joe  joe lawrence  finds himself  reluctantly  on a double date with his sister blossom  mayim niali  her boyfriend vinnie  david lascher  and blossom s best friend six lemeure  jenna von oy . the group go in separate vehicles and when joe is taking six home they run out of gas. despite joe saying everything imaginable to make it clear to six that he isn t interested in her sexually the young woman proceeds to attack him. joe does his best to elude her until he falls out of the car and bangs his head. during this entire incident either a live studio audience was laughing or canned laughter was added in post production. the following season featured an episode called  the date  in which blossom goes out with a boy named josh  james marsden  and essentially the same thing happens  except  as blossom puts it  she leads him on  no excuse for his actions by the way . in this version of the scenario there is no laughter and the assault is played very seriously. i don t think i ve ever seen a more clear cut and brazen showing of the double standard on one show.which brings us back to the main topic of this piece  thor  love and thunder  and how it continues this practise of using male victims of abuse as comedy relief. an alternative to the  flick  scene scene would have been to barrow an idea from the movie  the boondocks saints 2   where sean patrick flanery and norman reedus do a montage in which they are preparing to return to the united states to deal with a killer smearing their reputation. part of that montage included them showering  and that s what should have been done with hemsworth in love and thunder. instead of the  flick  spot with zeus  a shower scene would have allowed them the gratuitous bare butt footage and a good look at his tattoos honouring loki  without anything resembling sexual assault.there is  of course  one final matter i d like to note  and that is the epic failure in the depiction of the female heroes. namely jane foster and valkyrie  two women who prove themselves to be unworthy of their power  status  and especially thor s trust.first let s talk briefly about valkyrie  tessa thompson . a former member of asgard s elite band of female warriors  who found herself  and her sisterhood  defeated by odins first born hela  kate blanchet . after that fateful confrontation she turns her back on her homeland  betrays her oath to the throne  and runs away with her tail between her legs to become a slave trader and a drunk. then  after having had the throne of  new  asgard bestowed upon her by a troubled thor odinson  she betrays him by not assisting when he is sexually assaulted and humiliated by zeus. instead she chooses to sit on her useless backside  eating grapes  and ogling thor like a slut in heat.next  of course  is jane foster  natalie portman   thor s former love interest. the woman who not only broke his heart  but stoled his name  his job  his look  and his precious hammer. yes  the hammermj lnir  the one you have to be  worthy of  in order to lift. i  however  would have to ask what qualifies as worthy to asgardians when a woman who committed domestic assault on her boyfriend  she slapped him twice in thor  the dark world  is qualified. then  like her girl power pal valkyrie  she also chose to sit on her useless backside  eating grapes  and ogling thor like a slut in heat while thor was being abused by zeus. nice job taika waititi  and jennifer kaytin robinson  you ve managed set female superheroes back 70  years  and now i ve heard wonder woman is back to being a receptionist at justice league headquarters. in closing  if i had a daughter  and she told me she wanted to grow up to be anything like valkyrie or jane  i would have no choice but to consider myself a failure as a father.
the frumpy cow line got me keep crossing the fingers for this one to crash and burn so maybe something like a remaster can happen. have a great memorial day with your family  melonie. you look beautiful
no more ruining lara croft! especially with that masculine jaw line on lara in that picture. just no more. great video today melonie! you look beautiful too and have a happy memorial day and a relaxing weekend.  o
suddenly i m inspired to create a lard croft game where you play as an overweight adventurer. she can t jump high  she can t pull herself up ledges. she can t run far without running out of stamina. even a battle with an alley cat is life or death. it s gonna be true hardcore survival adventurer
why is it soo fuckin hard for them to make lara look good and bring back duel pistols damn it.
we are forever mike of the rlm meme of  how does it feel to have lived long enough to see all your favorite franchises go down in flames   when it it comes to tomb raider. feels great
cool room lighting.  classic lara is the bomb! i think that c. d. may be worried about the fan base aging and are a looking for the a new generation of fans. i m 62. been a fan a long time  but it s not as important to me as it once was. that said  classic lara is thee bomb!!!
not dead  but still injured
great video! thanks  i can relate to what you said about disturbing your peace and classic  original tr. i felt like that  too. it really upset me so much! i 1000  agree with your opinion. i feel the same way. no hope left. original lara croft needs to return pls!  i just subscribed to your channel because i m a classic tr fan since the beginning  too and i miss lc!
tomb raider 2027 lara is a trans lesbian indo chinese but also latina and she fights to find the secret sacred  lgbt flag
dang homie  you didn t have go that hard
we need more western female characters looking like lara croft.
@ignochomp99  which one
id be fine with a landwhale in like a persona game. but as a persona. and as an actual landwhale. not just some fat human.
well a bit curvier no offense. anniversary lara was the best
@residentpolarbear  probably the best remake i ever played. perfectly captured the original game while making it nice and fresh
@residentpolarbear  100
@natorious the hopeful  lol triggered
@natorious the hopeful  the one from tomb raider legends from the 360 era.
thanks to crystal dynamics  all those franchises did was generate debt.
@3storms  it had nothing to do with cd. they develop the game. they do as they re told. it s eidos and square who give the orders.and it s a myth that the rebirth trilogy didn t do well. it s actually heading towards 50 million total sales.that s as much as the um   bestseller  uncharted series has done  in it s entire run.
@lone star  50 million total sales  that s amazing.  um.... how much was each copy sold for exactly    i can assure you  most of them weren t for  60.  total sales   redundant.in the end though  if anyone ruined those franchises  it was squareenix.   when they  sqareenix d  the  augment your pre-order  into mankind divided  and quite literally divided the game into segments to sell as dlc    ya  i m not sure that falls on cd.squareenix is garbage  and selling those properties to absolutely anyone else  was to set them free.
squeernix
uh why  the 3 cd games were great. lara is still kicking
jensen was already messed up thanks to square  he can have a comeback i think. debatable on the others.
i can guarantee you that lara is lesbian in this one.
@chuchu   if embracer learned something from saints row. they ll never do that even if amazon said so.
optimistically its a lesson learned for them  they need to all learn from tlou  adapted excellently   and we good
@norman readdis  there is a korean arpg called lost ark. amazon published it and they black-faced a bunch of characters for diversity. if amazon publishes this one  then its within their standard to make her lesbian.
@chuchu   then prepare for a flop then. this companies need the butt light treatment.
didn t amazon do invincible and the boys though  may be different for any games.. it ll probably be garbage but ya never know.. even though we kinda do..
i ll keep an eye on things but i have zero faith on this one. lara croft is too high profile a character for the wokies not to utilize. i d be much more surprised if they didn t make lara lesbian and such.
you misspelled   amazon
exaaaactly.
i feel melonie on being tired  it s so exhausting to have your pleas fall on deaf ears that you just tune out and become apathetic. same reason i stopped playing certain games is because the developers stopped giving a fuck.
she won t. she s going to be scared and weak and use a bow like in the lame reboots.
yeah it almost be better if the deal did fall through they ll probably have dylan star in it
@el gato felix  chinese crap and counterfeit goodsazon
amazon is odd  they can crap out rop  yet do good things like reacher and terminal list. it kinda just sounds like a network channel. some crap and some good!
phoebe waller bridge  coming to destroy a franchise sacred to you very soon. i predict a fuming melonie mac video on the subject down the line.
well said
@steven jackson  she already made several  i think one a few days ago.
@chad crypto  i m thinking about after the series gets made and she s reviewing it.
@steven jackson  series  it s the last movie  didn t here about them making a series. lol
@chad crypto  i thought it was a lara croft series rather than another movie that was in the works. i m sure melonie mentioned it in one of her other videos  not sure which one though now.
@chuchu  nay  lesbianism is so yesterday.  it will turn out that lara croft used to be a boy named larion croft  and then he transitioned to become a strong independent womyn  and if you don t like it then you must be transphobic.
well thankfully the 3 cd games did  so not sure why this wouldn t
the original tomb raider games had very little in terms of story and were mostly about exploration  puzzle solving  and bursts of death defying acrobatics and action. i would never say good story telling is unnecessary because it always makes a game better  but we could still get a good tomb raider game without good story telling as long as the exploration was on point  and lara croft was sexy to look at again.
@mr mxyzptlk  the plot and characters of the reboot trilogy were below average. shadow was a snooze and cringe fest.
@samtheman  have you played the og  it s far better  and they re far from boring  they re widely considered grear
as a sonic fan as well. i too can vouch on that statement. there is hope if your willing to believe and there is a chance if fans are willing to fight
safe  yeah right
@ethan mastercrafter  agreed  and i got to ask  what are your thoughts on sonic frontiers
@natorious the hopeful  best thing since generations. and with the mods that have come out. game of the year
@ethan mastercrafter  oh i agree  and when that wave 3 dlc hits... you will not be able to find me for the next few weeks
no worries at all  i m very grateful! god bless you
final fantasy 7 remake  they have only done the first part of that remake
they ve been very open about it not being a 1 1 remake. it is essentially a sequel trilogy to ff7.
@mr. p  yes and i don t want a sequel
@dar  i get that. i mean it s not ff7 in the same way dirge of cerberus or crisis core wasn t ff7 either  but it s all the same  ff7  mythos. so  it s still very much ff7 in the broader sense  it just wasn t what you were hoping it was going to be.to be fair  i wouldn t mind seeing an actual remake either  but i also realize that s likely never going to happen unless we end up with something more akin to like what has happened with  say  diablo 2 resurrection where there was a graphics overhaul with modernized sprites  artwork  scenery  etc.  but running mostly off the original code.  some qol upgrades maybe a la the pixel remaster series too perhaps.but  being realistic  once they announced it was a trilogy and midgar would be the entirety of the first game  it was quite obvious isn t wasn t going to be a 1 1 remake.
i m interested in the remake story but what really made me worried about it it s the second timeline where zack lives but his aerith dissapears  that was the most stupid idea possible  i hate how they will probably use that as a way to reach a golden ending where everyone lives of some sort.honestly i wouldn t mind sephiroth not killing aerith in this new scenario and along with some other changes  but zack possibly living would make me hate it so much....deep inside i d rather just see the original game s story with the new engine  but guess we ll not see aerith die in hd and the ending will probably be way more anime generic than the original unfortunately.
yea you re alone in that
bro
bro
thank you andrew!
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
this will be better than what amazon pump out
makes to much sense. woketards have invaded the gaming scene years ago  now they are showing us who they all are. don t buy let it fail. show them by closing your wallet.
the last time we saw that laura was an underworld and it was a great ending. she found out that her mother moved on and she saved the world anna was gonna kill her  but she decided not to lara let her go move on you find peace as if i m fine with peace with my family.
because it s dated  i like the og but it s not nearly as enjoyable. there s a reason it sold considerably less than the cd games because it s just inferior in every way. the adventure  combat and movement is just stale in comparison.
she s also pregnant with a trans baby.
@sdubya1  yeah and i forgot...she is a strong single mother in a weelchair with vegan guns
how s it going melonie looking very gorgeous today. have a great friday and a fun memorial day weekend
i can t wait for lara to have the generic tank top and jeans combo literally every female character has now
no way this isn t another current year trainwreck. just no possible way.
if they re rushing tomb raider out  it ll probably be a mess when it released and broken...like many games these days.
happy friday melonie mac! have a great memorial day weekend and relaxing memorial day!
tomb raider video!hair back up again! charming change of pace. looks like the set is coming together.
ask the fired marketing people and the ceo at bud light how making a product their own instead of staying faithful to what it has alwsys been is working out for them.
make lara croft hot again.
i keep imagining a globetrotting  atmospheric  completely solo experience with classic indiana jones style  grounded ambience and danger  and maybe a dinosaur or two . something brutally hard  almost purely environmental  with no hints  no yellow ledges  just experimental leaps of faith and the briefest of gun fights  almost like samurai duels ... and then i quickly realize that it can t be made today. i ll check back in 10 years...edit  how d i forget lara s signature acrobatics ! the og games had such fluid movement they could rival 3d mario games.
last time i was this early  it was still  only two weeks to flatten muh curve
i can see this selling as well as rise did and then crumbling lower than even shadow did.
they should just release the classic series in a bundle or something. or even remake them.
hope so.
still not convinced on the whole  unification  thing - id software tried that with doom and it was kind of a mess.
i m a simple man.  i see a melonie video  i hit the like button.
i want them to return to original games before the reboot. i want to fight dinosaurs and i want lara croft to have her assets back in place
would the different eras of tomb raider be like... the first up to the last revelation -since they were built around the same game engine  i presume .  i don t know what angle of darkness was built off of.  i m thinking maybe the same engine  but with drastic changes  i ve only played it for the first few minutes of the paris level where lara is trying to get to the top of those apartments or whatever.  i couldn t get into at all  so i quit playing and haven t picked it up again since .  edit  core erathe 2nd era would be legend to underworld.  i love the 1st era games  but the 2nd would be my favorite due to the improved game mechanics and visuals.  edit  crystal dynamics era.3rd era would be starting with the 2013 release    reboot    .  mechanics wise - one could see them as an improvement  but the story just  almost   killed it.  so  not a fan of the 3rd tr era.  i d really love to see where tr dox  tr2 remake  fangame will be going -if anywhere.  maybe it s a lost cause  but it does seem to be heavily influenced by the 2nd era of games.
still a game coming out    it s going to be completely phukked. i have absolutely zero faith in crystal and amazon. please people wake up and don t buy this garbage.just emulate the previous games stream them too. close your wallets.
i remember playing tomb raider 2 as a kid when it first came out and i still remember how awesome it felt to play  i haven t ever had the same feeling playing any modern ones.like yeah  graphics are amazing etcetera etcetera but  just.. idk  just feels generic action and more of a chore playing instead of just being fun and raw.if they re going to remodel lara anyway  they should remodel her as melonie. lara with tattoos  black painted nails and wavy hair  hell yeah
yeeeyyyy the statue is back in the background
facts the up do is always cute on her
and don t forget the tasteful classical music
i m afraid you re day dreaming my friend.
rofl!!!
rise was released on the same day as fallout 4. also it was timed exclusive to xbox and it was not released on the biggest console at that time  playstation 4. it had so much potential.
that s what embracer wants to do and it s the reason they bought the series along with legacy of kain but crystal dynamics just doesn t want to do them even though it is easy money and really feels like an ego thing at the end of the day.
i might consider a nice classic bundle for switch.
@wingedlight8415  doesn t embracer own tomb raider  and by proxy crystal dynamics  surely whatever embracer wants cd to do they d have to do
@superhitman55  agreed and also the script was conceived before square enix sold them to embracer so it s possible embracer wanted to change it which is why square enix were so quick in reacting to the leak.
@wingedlight8415  i just hope we get the old school core design style of tomb raider
i agree  they are pretty small in the reboot trilogy
the reboot tombraider in 2013 was great. never played the sequels.
we want to see our lara croft again. and hope johanna wont get nerfed like they did lara
too many companies take what we love and bastardise it  from star wars to tomb raider
it s scary how my views and opinons about lara and the franchise align with yours. like  we re on exactly the same page as far as tomb raider is concerned.
tomb raider is truly dead and buried.
well then. i definitely hope it s what you ve been hoping for in a tomb raider game. if it s announced that is.
woke raider coming soon  if lara isn t sexy and has the personality from the classic era i m gonna be disappointed. love the reboots but i want a return to the old school fun tomb raiding!
so i just found your channel yesterday and i gotta say you seem pretty cool
alright a new melonie video. i just got home. i m going to joy watching this. great to see you melonie
lara better not look like freebee walrus bridge
you should become a partner of tomb raider so at lease we know it will be done right.
i d really love to see remakes of the original games
only time will tell i m reserving my time to see what comes of this new entry
i just want rereleases of the original 5 with trophies achievements.
weird how i can see myself saving modern lara from a cliff but the old red glasses curvy psone lara croft even from angel of darkness would betray or kill me in a heartbeat she is so badass
any new announcements with tomb raider  i ve realized  don t really get me excited anymore or interested. it makes me sad because i was a huge tomb raider fan growing up  i wanted to be as awesome as her  but noooope. can t have badass women in this day and age  no sirree!
done with tomb raider i ll stick to the classics
nothing beats a melonie mac thumbnail
9 15 - 9 45i feel this segment is what it all boils down to. hit the nail on the head with this point. i mean  i think there is more to it  but their ego is certainly in play here.
say what you want about legends and underworld  i ll take those games over lame modern tomb raider.
for real
they would still be phukked up somehow. 100
not a remake  i think a hd port would be better
hopefully never  you really wanna trust modern devs with that  they d nerf the hell out of classic lara croft and dumb down the game to make it easier for modern gamers  what made those games special originally will most likely be gone. only thing that would be better is graphics.now porting the older tomb raider games to new consoles is something i can get behind and hopefully that happens instead.
have you seen the new rotr game with gollum as a  good guy  main character!
its about time ip owners realise the sheer importance of iconic character design in video games
3 14 gretta thunberg.
it would be so awesome if  the current lara croft voice actress was used for the next tomb raider game
they made lara as a man too me.
wait crystal dynamics is doing the new perfect dark game  why is it that we get a new perfect dark and a new battletoads  yet we can t get a new banjo-kazooie or conker  come on rare  microsoft  whoever is in charge of those ips.
they still manage to ruin lara s beautiful image  gosh i am so tired of this ruination of objective beauty!! bring back beauty in video game characters!until then i will stick to emulator tomb raider originals!
shadow of the tomb raiders ending leaves them to do whatever for the next game. so i m looking forward to it
what  they modelling lara off greta thunberg now  lol
assassin s creed mirage  10 2023  is supposed to return to its roots.  we will see if it is worth it.  you know they will be watching.
crystal dynamics got perfect dark  does rare not exist anymore
thanks mel  stay gorgeous  babe...
tomb raider being discount uncharted with drama is kinda weird. classic tomb raider still is legit it s own thing in the genre. if the community treated this like devil may cry fans treated the dmc reboot i can promise classic lara would genuinely be back.
no it isn t.  assuming amazon won t butcher this ip is a fool s errand.especially considering what embracer has said they want to do with the franchise.
the best thing for tr is to keep it out of amazons hands
core design  were they also called eidos  i seem to remember that being the name of the publisher of the original tomb raider
embracer  hardly know her
all i want is a classic style tomb raider with better graphics and improved controls.
truck she s wearing a lot of makeup. maybe she blended it wrong but your face makes you look like a simpsons character.kept taking me out of the video.
i would personally love to see naughty dog take over the tomb raider series. i feel the mechanics  action  and storytelling would be interesting. i ll still play the new game and just mod it

i made a video on this when it was announced last year  they re being contracted to help
to be fair the dmc reboot wasn t all that bad. it just had some cringey lines and the bad screenplay.
finally someone else sees the truth.
but amazon has that money that tomb raider needs to come back.
core design were the developers and eidos was the publisher
@melonie mac go boom  cheers    thanks for the clarification
embracer is just a bunch of rich people trying to become more rich.
yeah me too    only thing we can do is just play our classics with mods etc
man  it s such a tragedy what happened to tomb raider. they hit gold and then the studio was rushed to finish aod that failed. then it was taken away as if the developers that made the series iconic were nothing. then after lau trilogy it was highjacked again to developers that hated everything that came before it and turned into something else and now they re trying  unify  their version of lara that will probably still not even feel like what we had before. just sprinkles of what it was. it s so sad. what other gaming company does this  why couldn t they just make their own franchise  oh right because it wouldn t sell as much without the tomb raider name.
same  girl. i feel the same about star wars. so sad.
classics stay classic. nice 90 s outfit btw.
we need a lara croft that looks like melonie
i m in the same boat as you and i really agree that we have to keep on demanding the classics. keep posting  keep sharing  keep demanding.
i love the most recent tomb raider trilogy love lory croft in the games she was perfect games to hopefully they don t mess it up
wow  june 8th is my birthday. so if we do get an annoucement on june 8th  then that ll be a cool b-day present.  i m turning 20 btw if anyone is curious.
tomb raider iii rocked! the best of the classics  in my opinion.
yeah yeah yeah  go boom. you don t need to remind me
i ve never played the original tomb raider games and only experienced the newer games. i really enjoy the new tomb raider games  i enjoy this version of lara croft  but i don t really know how she s different from the original. so i can t really blame og fans from being upset with the new direction.
i cant seem to get into tomb raider which is odd because my favorite series is assassins creed and its not much different mechanically. more stealth maybe. i think i cant get into it because i started with rise of the tomb raider and there is a lot of history i dont know. i played both rise and legend but i cant finish them for some reason.
their so called  own thing  is un-original. the current lara is a catness wanabe knock of from hunger games that itself is so happen to be a weak knock off battle royale..
i have zero faith that we ll see lara croft return to form  but i may still tune in to melonie to see how she blows a gasket when they ruin her again. it s like they know exactly how to sell lara croft  but they don t want to do it because it would be politically incorrect.
if amazon is involved  lara is going to be a lesbian or trans. i automatically lose all hope and interest sadly.
looks like the room is coming together. good job! the warmer colors look good on you going into summer  but don t forget to get some sun for health of body and mind. great video as always.
i feel the same way! knowing tr will not be tr is dissapointing. ok  we don t know yet  but it seems that way and we just can let things happen. i just hope the mess won t be so bad.
it would awesome ef here make  a new lara crott game but  think here suit remake  lara  crott  classic  i still  wouldn t like it ef here chance  dat lara dat she have a woman of a lover thanks for the video i love it i in joy it have a good day and night
crazy cause i actually think the crystal dynamic game is really good. oh well  guess i m in the minority.
will it be a poc  body positivity  lesbian  or a trans lara croft
just curious  is anyone going to post about the recent images from tomb raiders  mark of the phoenix  while  yes  crystal confirmed that the lore in those pages is not canon  official tomb raider illustrators have worked on those pages. there are pictures of lara croft  winston  jean yves  and more familiar characters in the core rulebook section. seriously  lara croft looks like the concept lara croft from tomb raider 1 with smaller breasts. check it out! could she be their vision of unified lara  it s good to speculate.
agreed!
nooooooooo
looks cheap and with too many companions  not my lara and not worth the effort of a video for me lol
honestly would have been better if they just brought over lara from the dark horse comics and based the games off that. but of course  everything nowadays has to have an agenda attached and they feel like not giving people what we want.
ok  they need to make you laura croft. no one deserves it more.
i m over it too at this point mel  we deserve better as a loyal fan base. if they do incorporate classic elements and gameplay it s still 10 years too late
the     future     of tomb raider is almost laughable now  from the roadtrip cartoon about lara and her friends to the cookbooks and board games  this is the lowest point the franchise has ever been since angel of darkness. crystal dynamics should focus on making a good tomb raider game. all this other cr4p about lara s friends going on adventures and investigating for her is so silly and ridiculous it s not even funny.
i m keeping an eye on this. i have no idea where embracer are or actually what they are capable of  apart from the sints row debacle but that s that dev company . i d like tomb raider to have a better future  but also  how well they handle tomb raider  also affects how well deus ex will also be  since it s eidios montreal and crystal dynamics that do that game too.
kwasade for the algorithm.
so excited for translesbian lara croft
it all depends on how much influence amazon has.  if amazon is just a publishing house then it falls on cd and embracer.  so this has a 30 percent chance of being good in the end.also just heard that amazon may have just went all in on lotr and bought the rights from wb and made a deal with embracer for the game rights.sooo........rip lotr.
they man-ified her face.
people these days  loud people at least  don t understand that roleplaying and fantasy does not equal dumpy real life people with mental issues.
hooray for lara! yay !
i hope to god they won t modernize her... again
i would have never thought i d ever say it  but i don t really care anymore. don t get me wrong  i would love to see proper lara again but lost hope. because now we need to her to be relatable. a girl that during gameplay has a bigger kill count than rambo and commando combined and as brutal as they were in rambo 4 5  but during cutscenes  she cries even when accidentally stomping on a . if someone says they can easily relate to that  then there s really something not quite ok with them.
safe
the partner was probably sony pulling out of the star wars kotor remake. development has been a shitshow and disney have been doing everything possible to kill the star wars brand. would be a terrible investment.
if they make another crappy tomb raider  i m going to make my own tomb raider game like in unreal engine 5  with crazy puzzles  tombs  dungeons  mummies  aliens  mythical creatures  different places like pyramids  temples  castles.
i really hope they don t end up making the new video games with sjw politics in mind  seeing as though it would completely ruin the franchise if they did.
alex zedra would be perfect!! you know  mara...from call of duty haha.you d make a perfect lara croft as well!!
the past will always give you strength.
would be better than the last garbage.
yep definitely getting bottom vibes from this version  not the traditional dommy mommy.
they will
she s not nearly fat enough. i m a fat activist! specifically i m fat and need others to be just like me so that i m affirmed. yay!
awesome. thank you.
they said a 2 billion dollar deal went wrong. 2 billion seems a lot for a franchise like tomb raider. the rights for lord of the rings were 250 million. a whole series 1 billion. i don t think with that amount of money it can be about tomb raider. or maybe the 2 billion thing was about multiple things.
you said it best on one of your previous videos  the 2013 reboot games were good in their own right but just shouldn t have slapped on the  tomb raider  name
melonie make a pretty hot tomb raider.
my only wish is to get a quality loyal to the originals remaster versions of  tr 1-5
i don t trust anything amazon publishes.
i dont have any hope for tomb raider under cd and i dont want to see them eff up perfect dark either but this is the world we live in unfortunately
i heard the new laura croft will be a afro american trans with muscles that make abyzilla envy.
i still say sony should buy tomb raider. it s better to have something out than a decade of silence. silence is never good. they need to track down and reunite core.
oof  not digging lara s face  looks nothing like...oh gosh  i m already repeating my 2013 reboot complaint and this new reboot hasn t even been revealed yet...i don t get cd s point of unifying the reboot with core tr  they ve been desperately trying to move away from og tr  but now they want to awkwardly stich it together in some weird attempt to make their bad reboot valid  why  if it s for sales  i doubt this move will increase numbers.
i love how the lara statue in the background always looks like she is checking melonie out  these new lc games could be good as long as anita sarkisian stays away from it.
hey  melonie i just want to tell you that you look beautiful with your yellowish gold tank top shirt and your curly hair pulled up in ponytail looks great too. also i just wanted to tell you that i am in clover south carolina visiting with my older sister and her family this week and this weekend and so i am so sorry for responding to your tweets and your youtube videos very late and i will try to keep up with them today and this weekend too  ok melonie. also i have to say that i am so happy that tomb raider video game is safe and i do hope that they will make it and do it correctly for us tomb raider fans happy with them and have us enjoy it after they bring it out to video game stores or online for us to buy it and play it on our computers or whatever video game system that we have to play the game. anyway that s all i have to say bout this video for today and i hope you are having a great day today and hope you are having a great week this week too. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today and hope you enjoy your evening at home and have a good nite too. also have a great weekend too and have a safe and wonderful memorial day weekend with your family too melonie. also god bless you and god loves you too.
unfortunately for classic tomb raider fans if this fails  tomb raider games are probably dead.  embracer doesn t have square enix funds  they killed saints row last year   it will probably be tomb raider s turn in 2025 ish .
the ip holders just want to make money so they make movies  series  stuff... i never considered the rebooted lara as lara. it is a different character only inspired by lara croft. you know who could play her in a movie  tess kielhamer  she already played her in a short video lara vs nathan drake.
you did make me worry. now your getting hopes up after the panic yesterday. i think it s fun for you to twist up people s emotions on things like this. but hey there s other people that will twist my mind up. and they ll do it carelessly.
3 00  are you about 5 9   too 5 50  the classic were too cumbersome  bad mechanics. if they want to retrocede  it should be inspired on anniversary. underworld had a series of bad little things  bad tuned mechanics  and a story too focused on women empowering.
i miss ...tomb raiding... the originals were so much better going to ancient tombs and solving puzzles.   still no idea how torches were still lit or how shotgun ammo was in there though . i just want a good old tomb raider game like 1 or 2 without aliens
yeah  but is it safe  didnt crystal dynamics make the last trilogy  the games werent terrible but they turned lara into a whiny  mid chick. we need hot lara croft.
let s be fair here sk  not a studio to brag about. they are also guilty of doing some truly shady shit. too human maybe 2 generations old now  but that sucker was not a clean project. there is more nonsense surrounding that. maybe that bad behavior was a result of shock from cd s ceasing the project  but at the same time what was sk doing with it at the time  was it truly going to fix the many issues and short comings of blood omen. in the end the result was one of the most legendary games to come out of that era of gaming. soul reaver. which was not an sk game. they took what sk had done and molded it into a much deeper narrative and interesting world to explore  without the lousy load times. i don t think lok would have become the classic we know today without cd. i feel like the audience in question wouldn t have even played blood omen  if it wasn t for soul reaver  i know i hadn t. does it make it right  i have no idea. i just know sk isn t always as innocent as they claim to be  their contributions to metal gear on game cube were much appreciated. i just don t think this props that tent very well. we d need to see the legal obligations of their contract as well. not the first time an ip has been signed a way to a publisher. see insomniac with resistance and r c  or ready at dawn with the order 1886 or ninja theory with heavenly sword. sony is nicer about it for sure. i think this was a case of the rights being signed a way and sk not being aware of what they were agreeing too. as far as tomb raider  i don t believe cd was ever its publisher  by time core lost ownershipt of tr  their were owned by eidos proper. though looking at wikipedia  it seems like eidos was always the publisher for that series and core a subsidiary by the time tr was handed off to cd. core had basically bombed their last two titles right  maybe you have a better understanding of what happened with angel of darkness and chronicles. so maybe the only way tomb raider could survive was with cd. given that core was sold to rebellion  strange brigade!!!!  in 2005 while it was working on the psp anniversary edition of the original title. i can only assume it was the only way the series could go on. though for that quick of a turn around time for tomb raider legend on so many platforms   leads me to believe both projects were done at the same time. given that cd would eventually release tr anniversary using the legend engine kind of tells me eidos wasn t seeing much value in keeping core around anymore. long story short  there probably wouldn t be a tomb raider today if it wasn t for these decisions. i don t see eidos selling one of its crown jewels to rebellion. given how bad rebellions software has been  i don t think tomb raider would have reached the heights it has today with shadow  rise  2011   legend  underworld  or anniversary. i will say this. at the end of the day  i do hope you get what you want. a return to classic tomb raider story telling. i ve had my phone with the last two reboot trilogies. it would be exciting to see what could be done if cd went back to appreciate that original flare that made lara so refreshing in the 90s. the little bit that made her more like bulock in raiders of the lost ark and less like indiana jones where things belonged in a museum. a dare devil adreneline junky who gets herself into trouble and then gets herself out. no baggage. we ve had a lot of heroes with baggage  time to come up for some air. not everyone needs daddy issues to become a globe trotting tomb raider who fights dinosaurs  what was the explination for this lol . i still think strong narrative would be nice  but keep it linear and try to use the world a bit more to tell the story. still room to grow there. we have the hardware power to really take it to new heights.
nope i m 5 6   also you re wrong  the classics were amazing  people just gotta git gudsounds like you just want a walk in the park easy game like the legend trilogy was  no thankies
@melonie mac go boom  it can be hard  but should be modern too.
tomb raider 1 to angel of darkness. loved lara in aod
we won t say anything until we see gameplays
as much as i liked the reboot games  we need classic lara croft back! i dont want to see her having a companion joining her on her adventure it needs to be solo  only time i want to see another person is the villian ambushing her or something lol  in all honesty though majority of the fans want classic lara back and arent devs supposed to make games for the fans  so do what we want and bring back classic lara! also i do hope we get an announcment at sgf
holy cow  that concept art of lara.  you could strike a match on that jaw.
i have said this before and i will say it again classic tomb raider is long gone. unless the fandom is willing to push back hard like what dmc fans did back in 2010 or what is going on now with stuff like bud light you will never see a return to form for tomb raider. the entire fandom or close to it has to send the message strongly that they want og lara back. the same thing that happened with dmc also happened with saints row recently. you all have to stand togather. the thing is when the tomb raider reboot was a thing most of you just went along with it where dmc fans outright rejected their reboot as soon as it was seen. that is what needs to happen with this
i m happy they didn t corrupt legacy of kain as much as they ve corrupted tomb raider
everyone wants an attractive lara croft instead of the landwhale dove is trying to push ...amazon would have destroyed this franchise
the art looks so good from the back but then you see lara s face and it s just  no. but  if the story and gameplay are similar to the old tomb raider games  i ll be happy.
i know how much you love lara croft  i m sorry to hear the horrible indiana jones killer is writing for it.  that s depressing.  combined with how amazon destroyed their fake lotr show  it s looking rough for lara.  i m worried the same could be true for one of my favorite game series fallout in that show.  i give it 50 50 on it ll either suck or they ll honor the source material for a change.
they re announcing the death of the franchise  to appeal to a modern audience.
unless they hand over development to some japanese korean chinese developer who couldn t give a damn about western snowflake-feelings  lara will be intentionally unattractive  the game will focus on story and plot instead of on capturing a sense of adventure and treasure-hunting  and the graphics will be nice but still uninspired and soul-less. lara will be a wimp who needs to  level up  instead of how she originally was with all skills ready to go right in the beginning. they really need to dump crystal dynamics.
hey  maybe it ll be really good  guys!
watch it turn out to be just a random fan art or ai generated picture.
now that embracer group owns tomb raider  the new tomb raider will have the quality of  gollum 2023 .
3 13 young kevin bacon as lara
tomb raider is my game just like everyone else has theirs and what they have done to lara in the past few games is diabolical  what they need to do is go back to the beginning and give us that in the next generation oh and she is an upper crust english woman with a desire for archaeology and puzzles
i am just expecting a tiana croft to ruin everything.
mel u have a great laura croft look going today  if that wasnt u goal thats even better!
i m guessing the facial features are a self-insert of a dev working on the project.
this laras  face looks like gretha thunberg
the only tomb raider reboot i want to see is a remake collection similar to crash bandicoot insane trilogy and spyro the reinighted trilogy  in which they remake the 1st 4 games  tomb raider  tomb raider 2  tomb raider 3  and tomb raider  the last revelation into one epic collection. as bixby snyder says on television in robocop   i ll buy that for a dollar! i  too  have zero faith in the perfect dark reboot and similar to what happened to orchid in the fantastic killer instinct reboot and the dark queen in the forgettable battletoads reboot. joanna dark is going to be woke as hell  and unlike the other 2 games i mentioned  the entire game is more than likely going to become an sjw political soap box. also  you look nice in today s video.
yeah. it s crazy to think that originally raziel wasn t supposed to be in the legacy of kain franchise!
amazon   june   lara is lesbian trans
i would ve prefer to see tomb raider get a remake treatment like re4  dead space and now snake eater
sigh... if amazon gets it s claws on it then it s anything but safe  better a franchise be dead than in the hands of amazon  crystal dynamics is definitely the lesser evil  as crazy as it sounds...
they gonna make new lara croft is anglo-indian
you know what is going to happen to tomb raider  right  it is going down the same path as idiana jones. down hill.well  good luck to you. i hope it does turn around  but i don t believe it will.
no way amazon doesn t shit all over the source material. they did it with lord of the rings  they did it with the wheel of time  and they ll 100  do it with tomb raider. shame.
i knew crystal highjacked it. i wasn t crazy after all.
i just gave up   lost hope... i will just keep playing the classics.
yeah everybody was on bucking out saying tomb raider is doomed it s gonna die they are gonna turn it woke.  like the reboot saints row which is dead those were all ideas that did not get forward.  i m like a calm down it s not that serious hey here s a cookie and some milk. they re not gonna ruin her they ll get their heads taken off if they did.
a dissenting opinion  i actually hated the  classic  lara croft  but i am a big fan of the new reboot series of tomb raider.   i have the same experiences with xcom  i hated the classic series from 1990s  but i am a big fan of the new reboot series.    the new tomb raider  as well as the new xcom  actually has overwhelmingly positive  all  user ratings reviews on steam.  none of the classic tomb raider or xcom game had ever gotten  overwhelmingly  positive ratings or reviews.   so imo more gamers enjoy the new reboots better than the classics.i had ignored overlooked the new reboot for a couple year after its release because i hated the classic tomb raider.  i had assumed the reboot was more or less the same bore as the classic.  two years after the reboot had come out   i was browsing and discovering games on steam  and i saw the  overwhelmingly positive  user reviews for the reboot.    i read a few user reviews that mentioned the reboot was nothing like the old games  and it was more like uncharted with some rpg mechanics.  that was when i decided to give the reboot a try and ended up loving it.  with that being said  now that tomb raider has fallen into amazon s hand  it will likely be ruined by amazon s woke agenda.
with amazon i am concerned what they will do to franchises. look what they did to lotr. and bezos doesn t care about gaming. he doesn t even know what twitch is. no joke. so if he cares about woke ideology  but he doesn t care about gaming  doesn t know anything about it  doesn t care that much about money  and let them destroy lotr  i can imagine  he lets them do with tomb raider whatever they want. he hired woke activists. ceos give the direction. who should get hired  the culture in the company. so he decided to hire woke activists. exclusivly. i am concerned  they will make everything  amazon touches  woke. so i just hope  they don t get their hands on more franchises. what they did and do is sickening
i think we re going to a revival of this game  look at the way other games are getting a bunch or reboots and remasters this year.
i was so damn angry! now i am not. it is why i come here.
you know what  i m feeling the reverb.
that one face shot  of lara looks kinda like  handsome jack  from the borderlands franchise.
the question is  will it actually be good  or full of woke garbage
just wait until you find out about the totally spies reboot
hashtag bringbackshorts
comment for tomb raider
i enjoy the reboot series but i  have interest in playing the original tomb raider games
tomb raider 1  i rather not. that game is a classic and if they were to touch it today they d ruin it with their agenda
lmfao ok dreamer
@bowsette  not really have you seen all of the remasters  and remakes coming out
bringbackbooba
then at the end of the video all this talk and it s literally nothing. in a video with this length ifk how you come up with all that to say.
so are you going to be the new lara croft i could see a melonie going boom boom lol.
if those are official art  i ve seen better  and they re from fans. there is this guy who remade classic lara fmv model to work on faux official core design wallpaper art and they re really good.
wait embracer is doing something right after saints row flopped
what does ur fictional character look like then  u do know the original laura croft was based on nell mcandrew a super hot british model well the 3rd one of the original ones.she was my favourite croft
i guess laura lost weight.
thanks melanie mac d
is this game going to be any good  why do they have to give lara a face like a t girl   that s not a good sign
just as long they don t touch godzilla
lara the face pic looks like fiona the ogre mid transition
why do they keep giving her a dudes faceseriously whats with that shit
she looks like greta  un rep
i don t really care about tomb raider. it has been done so many times that there is just not much else they can do with it.
may i asked why your standing on recent uploads
i may as well go back to tomb raider tbh.. prince of persia seems to be coming via turtle
crystal dynamics should ve worked on tomb raider 2 3 chronicles and last revelations after tomb raider 1 the anniversary some where before or after underworld. but that s like trying to tell a piece of scum to grow spine not impossible but very unlikely to happen.
lara looks like jaunceydev
are you ever gonna do a house tour
thank you for the good news beautiful
not going to happen. keep your wallet closed.
nell mcandrew didn t join as a model until years after tomb raider 1 s launch  lara croft was never modeled after her. the models were basically booth babes  nothing more  and i loved them
no  too many creeps online who will figure out my address if i do that and i already have stalker situations as it is
no reboot lara please
the facial expression of a chick that s pissed she had to hit the gym to get back to her original form...
or he doesn thave the featuresof laura lara croft
it s just going to be another farcry rip off like the last two game s
the face looks off by a lot like lara s ancestor
they are also doing the legacy of the kain series. i had an email about it from crystal dyamics
phoebe is going to destroy tomb raider unfortunately. just look at indiana jones dial of destiny.
how long until we have a trans-man as lara croft   men are overshadowing women everywhere else in today s clown world.
one of samus arans vision has been saved from ridley s woke army
wouldn t surprise me one bit if they tried to make lara trans....not even kidding
yeah  now we can finally get lara s spectacular lesbian adventures as she travels the world to protect ancient relics from the evil white man...yayyyyyyy
a photon torpedo from the enterprise hit the
if lara looks like in the thumbnail  it ll be good. just hoping they won t push some woke agendas with it
when i see you  i see lara so square enix you must make the best choice so choose melonie for lara model game
if you aren t starring in it i ll wait for cable...
good news
melonie the reason why square enix sold eidos to embracer group was flop of guardians galaxy game good game but didn t sell great
hey melonie so new tomb raider is coming.
maybe it ll be worth pirating.
bot
@red i  look who s talking
far cry is a totally different game lul
square enix don t own the tomb raider ip any more or the studio that made the games
@junde  hoo  i m sorry perhaps you don t know but i don t speak to you so!!!
not really
avengers  not gotg
doubt it
better not be a mobile game...
unreal engine 5 on mobile
