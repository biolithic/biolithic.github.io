my wife and i moved to florida 3 years ago and we excited to have good healthcare  we are in our 50s.  after several attempts to see doctors and specialists here it has become painfully clear that medicine in america has fundamentally changed.  after getting a blood clot and taking blood thinners i told my dr i didn t think the vacks was a good idea.  she went nuts  totally emotional breakdown and performance  telling me how everyone is dying from it  there are no hospital beds available etc.  one time i complained about pain in my throat and she didn t even look.  i ended up with a full blown all over my body candida outbreak tthat could have been easily avoided.  she refused to refill my asthma inhaler telling me to go to the er.  so i went to the er just to get an asthma inhaler.  keep in mind this is all with full health insurance.  now we try everything possible before even thinking about going to a doctor. we try to eat right  use homeopathic remedies when possible  and study the word of god daily.  you don t go to the doctor to get better  you go there to get sick and waste a ton of money.
i am always amazed how articulate you can be for 15 minutes without reading from a script.  thank you.
the two doctors i trust are youtube heroes of mine. they are dr. ken berry and dr. eric berg whom both are researchers and do their due diligence before saying anything on their channels. i listen to every word they say and i am healthier for it. for example  i had acid reflux and took pills daily for maybe eight years  i watched dr. berg discuss the issue and the answer was to take two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar before each meal. guess what...the acid reflux rarely happens now. neither of these two guys believe in the american medical assn. for good reasons. watch their videos on youtube and be happier and healthier.
i stopped going to the dr and dentist when the lockdown happened.  i have severe gum disease.  every 3 months  i was at the periodontal disease doctor  and he would inject my gums with antibiotics.  i was always sick. my life was like this for over 20 years.  incoming pandemic.  my appts were all canceled.  i was so sick. i reached out to the holistic community and have practically cured myself.  it took time  but i am a new person.  for some reason  dentists and doctors are not being trained to cure. just to make money for big pharma. no jabs since i was a baby.
we switched a few years ago to a dr that does not use insurance. we pay a small monthly fee and there are no copays  office charges  etc. we can go as often as needed  call  text or email with questions at any time. dr keeps the patient group small to ensure attention is provided when needed. prescriptions are cheap  like pennies on the dollar  and the dr will make house call or meet after hours at the office for emergencies. best medical decision we ve ever made.
reading articles about euthanasia becoming an acceptable practice. canada already embraces this and now japan is discussing euthanasia and the practice of sepku. i was not surprised as this comes from people who see no value in human life and wisdom of older people. i can honestly say i have never been so glad to be on the latter end of my lifespan. i grieve for my sons and grandchildren.as a nurse i have the skills and knowledge to care for myself  my husband and family and friends. i strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle daily and stay away from doctors as much as possible.
the shift in demographics in the us is something rarely addressed by anyone.  glad you mentioned it!
preppers are wise being prepared for  what if  i m now in my 5th day without power here in my city in new zealand but have to trust god with my life and future i wasn t ready for the severity of this cyclone worst case scenario to live through but kiwis help each other i ll find out on monday about my job my factory is in one of the flood zones but i m a christian and whatever comes i know that i have my eternal destiny sorted life is short eternity is forever get right with god before you die god bless from new zealand
a good friend of mine that is an mechanical engineer said young people coming out of engineering school know specific temp science data but couldn t figure out the lie of climate change until he challenged their perspective with temp and solar data. one rejected it out right and the other he said was like oh  why didn t i think of that....
you are spot on with your analysis. i am 71  and spent 22yrs in the military. what s coming you aren t ready for. i don t care if you think you re a pepper. trust me you aren t ready. i don t know how you could be
this boomer spends his mornings at the range  his afternoons at the gym  and his evenings at the reloading bench   thanks for another great video. i think you re reaching a lot of people.
this video hits home in a very real way...florida being known as   god s waiting room   the sheer amount of    baby boomer   elderly people down here that will find themselves wanting and needing privately held  morally bound nursing skills knowledge will be almost beyond comprehension....  that demand will continue on for many decades to come. having personally taken the online course i can 110  attest that those skills are worth 10-100x what @thepatriotnurse is charging !! definitely recommend getting this training !!!! no matter where you are but for those in florida ..it is not an overstatement to call it mandatory required knowledge going forward...
we have homeschooled and home birthed.  having had no insurance for decades  we have taken care of 95  of our health issues at home via excellent natural practicing doctors.  i have recently been thinking about how to care for end of life details at home. i don t like that idea but i ve seen and heard of too many bad outcomes in the hospital.  not a friendly place.
there s a solution to ai generating papers  make them do oral exams in person like they used to do in the old times. if they need to do formulas  they can go up to the board and do the problems themselves with no electronic help. for written communication  bring back blue books. make people write out their essays in person and ban electronic devices in the classroom.
love your updates patriot nurse!  thanks a ton for all that you do!
love your content. as always  it s pretty comprehensive  and insightful.however...i would like to point out  that what we re seeing  is not because of short sighted  opportunistic charlatans. but rather  a concerted effort  that has been used over and over  spanning thousands of years  and numerous civilizations.each time  they get a little further along  until they re crushed. world war ii  was the last major push  and it was nearly accomplished  until the united states was financially supported and duped into action.it s like  watching someone try something often enough to fine tune their plan  and then reattempt it later down the road  when conditions are ripe.the banksters that are responsible for all of this  are the very same  money changers   that jesus chased out of the temple  for works of iniquity  on the sabbath  in the lord s house. they haven t gone away.all of what you say  is dead on. but what s driving it  is long established evil.
your insights and wisdom are greatly appreciated. sometimes you educate. sometimes you remind. most times you awaken us to reality.  thank you pn.
i m almost 70  so i am a  baby boomer   and have been a  prepper  for decades.talking too and mentoring younger generations has really opened my eyes  as most are really naive and not self reliant.
so rare to find a real nurse and a true patriot. thank you for your service to humanity and sending prayers to you for your safety and prosperity.
in 5 years of weeding through people  this is the wisest woman i can give you!
they want you to buy the insurance but they don t want to treat you
my thoughts exactly! my wife and i are 55 and i avoid docs at all cost. i joke that my hernia doc is my family physician cause that was the only time i ever go to the doctor.
but why didn t u change drs . not all of them are psychos
im in florida too my dr.  despite the fla law.  pushes the inoculationsand actually argues with me. pointless because hes not doing any of his own research just an active mouth pc.
i stopped using md s instead i now have a very capable  compassionate do. tell me like it is and will prescribe when needed good old penicillin.  look for a doctor of osteopathic  medicine.
i m 48 and haven t been to the doctor since i broke my arm in middle school and haven t had any vaccinations since the last set for school.the way i see it is that i m going to live and then i m going to die. i don t need a doctor interfering with the process. the lord will call me when it s time to come home.
im in healthcare and try everything before going to the dr
yes the system is broken. thanks for sharing
you just went to the wrong doctor.  i don t even have a primary care doctor  i use the walk-in clinic near my work. they are inexpensive--and give great care.  they gave me an open-ended prescription for my inhaler  so i can get one from the pharmacy whenever i need one.   you need to change doctors.
@zolpty1164  trying to find one who isn t is hard. i go to my chiropractor for uti treatment now.
my nephew goes through this too. he can t stand the er or urgent no-care  as it should be called . thank goodness i have va care. it s taught me to be proactive with my own health care otherwise i d be dead by now.
agree
immediate care centers have no drama
@naturescapesstudio  ask your chiro for a recommendation of a primary care phy who accepts eastern meds. if anyone should know  he she should...
@naturescapesstudio  well that s ineffective.  lol
@nathanielovaughn2145  i see them losing a lot. because today you can t even see a doctor. or at least not where i live perand they will lose money our health care system is broken so health insurance should not be mandatory at all
go to an urgent care instead of er.  next  get a new doctor.
we re in swfl and our primary care doc asked if we had gotten the immunization from 2020. we told him absolutely not. he said  good  because all the recent scientific events is showing that it s causing more harm than good
performance is right and telling
you should have found a new doctor a long time a ago when she went nuts about the jab!
@zolpty1164  no - but they are afraid of losing their license to practice.
@nitagilbert1681  not sure they even want to treat you - especially if you know more than they.
@donnamullins2089  some do s are just like allopaths.
@dragonfly9209  where do u live  walk-ins i know are very costly.
@naturescapesstudio  try reflexology - amazing results - also naturopaths
@toryallan7967  some in the va are good  but there are some that are plain nasty
@nitagilbert1681  mandatory because of 1  fear and 2  control.
dump insurance  is a scam.prepare to use cash everywhere. also  find a good doctor. they re out there  just hard to find. interview your health care professionals    make them do their work!
@davescrimshaw7781   i live in texas.i am over 65 now  and have medicare insurance  so i don t pay anything. without insurance--a basic visit runs about  100- 125. not bad---and much cheaper than the er.
you nailed it.
@dragonfly9209  true -  er requires a sb loan
@davescrimshaw7781  indeed....i would never go there if it could be avoided.
i am in va  just turned 65 and now on medicare. can t even find a dr of any kind that accepts medicare and new patients. so even tho i pay  164 for medicare and  88 for part n. i am without care. and no hopes of getting any. well except the er
you need a better doctor and you should definitely sue that doctor for their refusal to give you appropriate care. these people will not learn until the lawsuits start piling up.
time for a new doctor.
totally agree
exactly! it s the same everywhere! it s deathcare not healthcare now.
my friend  i m sorry for the experience you ve had with those doctors. i think there are a lot of folks in that field who are there for all the wrong reasons. i ll pray for you  brother
@kathymc1569  i have. we just don t have those in our area. believe me i ve looked for alternatives and in fact the chiro i have i pay for out of pocket because he doesn t take insurance. stuck with medical cabal in this area.
@davescrimshaw7781  i would if there were any around. also i m on ss do medicare doesn t pay for much off their plan. i do already pay out of pocket for some but i have to educate myself in order to stay healthy and out of the system.
report the doctor for refusing to allow you an inhaler prescription. that could of been deadly!
when i get a sore throat  i immediately gargle with 50 50 apple cider vinegar and 98  it s gone in 2 days. i also add 1 tbls to my water. all better! i stay away from dr.s too!
medical insurance is expensive  don t care where you live. but when you go because you have a problem and the doctor says yes we need to treat the issue the insurance company likes to decline the work as long as possible. in hopes you either die or push it so far out the work becomes an emergency then the hospital can over charge the insurance company. makes sense dosent it   it s a mess and at the point people just don t want to go in gear of the bill they know will be 3 times over when if done sooner would have been better for your health and cheaper for all  i hold that to be true because it happened to me.
hello moscowcoy_13  so sorry that you too have had such horrible experiences with drs. and healthcare in general. we too here in texas have the same awful levels of incompetence  willful ignorance along with seemingly limitless     greed of the medical care industry. one of many sad experiences i ve had in dealing with doctors was of some 20 years ago i accompanied my elderly parents to a new doctor and as part of the examination i requested that they have chem-20 blood tests taken as part of their regular health monitoring which we d had times before. this doctor flat out refused to order the blood tests while saying straight out to me  in front of my parents    well at their ages  why bother  what difference would it make anyway   as in your case they too had full medical insurance with medicare and full co-insurance which would have paid it all. as far as he was concerned they   being elderly were ready for  the bone yard   so why waste time on them. i felt awful after subjecting my parents to this and still do. i ve had other just as disgusting encounters with doctors and hospitals but won t go into them. all i can say is that in dealing with doctors and hospitals today we are all walking thru  mine fields  and must use our own heads  do our own homework and research while at the same time looking upwards for higher guidance and assistance from above in order receive the answers we need and will be given. the best of everything to you folks.
gods health care plan. proverbs 4  20-22
i ve read that about 70  of physicians are now working for corporate medical institutions .they must obey.
we all should pick a state   move there and barter !
@florida man  100 agree with you!  haven t been to a doctor since my 30 s. 61 yo next month
@florida man  100 agree with you!  haven t been to a doctor since my 30 s. 61 h yo next month
you need to switch healthcare providers.  period.  not all doctors are like this.  some of them are true angels.
also  florida is old people world.  so the doctors are worn out there.  but you keep changing doctors until you find a good one.  the good ones are plentiful.  people need to stop with the fear mongering and drama.
@moscowcowboy_13 maybe someone mentioned it in the comments already  but try gargling and rinsing with some water to prevent both throat irritation and candida with inhalers. rinse and then spit out. also  you could try asking your provider for a spacer for your inhaler too to help prevent such problems. hope this helps.
welcome to america s 3rd world health care
i only rarely go to the doctor when i have a bronchitis flare up to get symbicort end a steroid.  and i m going next week to demand a blood test to check my vitamin levels and get approval for a colonoscopy.  otherwise i stay far away from doctors
you mean here in florida
@zolpty1164  you richard
@zolpty1164  they quit
our healthcare has gone way down hill. the office staff are rude and incompetent and make mistakes on scheduling  billing and appointments. the doctors don t listen to you and are prescribing meds to try and help with symptoms. these meds often make things worse in other areas  so they prescribe more. they don t focus on diet  exercise  weight and mental health. i haven t  nor have i heard from anyone  recently have a good experience. they draw blood do they give you results  nope. can you get an appointment relatively soon  nope. just awful
so sorry to hear ! keep the faith ! seriously though   our faith endures and perseveres   our god is an awesome god !
dr. mccullough has a telehealth  fairly new. if you want the link  holla.
@cmountain6  what is a chem20 test
pls find a different md. there are some good mds where i m at  sl south tampa. you can get bad mds  so you just need to search to find them.
yes  change doctors but you have to look out for yourself.  and your new found self help should not be abandoned.  yeah  no more shots  eat right and take vitamins and exercize.
@naturescapesstudio  you go to a chiropractor for chronic uti  a young family member has a chronic uti and no doctor can help her! what does a chiropractor do for uti s
@jesuschrist-gives-eternal-life  wow nice name there..who does this
@jesuschrist-gives-eternal-life  not drama when it s true
dr. sten ekberg is another helpful one
@jesuschrist-gives-eternal-life  shill much  what are you 5
@reversesnowbird5764  praise god your doctor actually identified  accepts    speaks the truth.
@tonynjanet1  my older relative had chronic utis until we put her on daily cranberry pills.  i think she had maybe one more and then never had another one over years of caring for her.
@edwardjimenez6700 why would you expect judges to be any different. new doctors graduating a taking a social justice oath to right history s wrong by allocating  equality  vs care where it s needed
keep looking for a different dr  in florida you re more likely to find bc so many moved there to have freedom. also- the american frontline drs   the ones banned   censored for speaking out about ivermectin  hcq   immune health  do telehealth visits    even have pharmacists that will give you rx if your local one won t. there s a lot of things you could use them for   avoid local drs.

great niece had red w many visible blisters in her throat  101  fever  aches everywhere for a week  couldn t eat   the pediatrician looked @ her throat   was shocked. he had a rx ready to send to the pharmacy but took a quick strep test   a quick mono test  both negative   they re not 100  accurate  did not send in a 48 hr test but told her to gargle w salt water   sent her on her way. next day she saw a ent specialist   he was appalled!  put her on a simple antibiotic   2 days later she s eating   no fever   no aches! dr s are threatened to not give antibiotics but sometimes it is necessary!  edit  i think people drs have forgotten how to use their brains!  mr primarydr will not see sick patients   refersto urgent care or er...
i agree! went through hell after they put in a spinal cord stimulator wrong! been a nightmare ever since.
move out of florida. if the shtf happens fl will be the last place on earth you ll want to be. tn  mo  nc. the air and water are cleaner in those areas and less congestion. the patient to doctor ratio in these states is much better for receiving quality care. i left fl in the early 80s because it was becoming over populated with many who don t believe in our constitution or way of life. good luck everyone.
@moscowcowboy. in my 50 s   live in the state of maryland whole life. my parents and wife parents lived in fla. 20 25yrs. without getting into details  florida healthcare is not good  this is coming from bad experience situations  the weather is great but thats about it.
primatene mist has been a good alternative to prescription asthma meds for me and is available at walmart. it s just under 30 bucks for a 200 dose inhaler.
i don t trust doctors. i haven t been to a doctor in at least 7 years.  i learn as much as possible on natural treatments. i treat my kids and they get well faster than the kids whose parents take them to hospitals clinics doctors for every little thing. i rarely get sick. i have been saying what you said  at the end of your comment  for years. i tell people hospitals are only for acute emergency care. you don t go there to get well. hospitals are where you go to pick up whatever illness is going around at the time. and yes  it is very expensive to go to a doctor and most things can be treated at home. unfortunately  most public schools  and even some employers  require a doctor s note if they are to believe you are actually sick. my kids  schools allow 5  parent note  days per semester.  after that  they require a doctor s note in order to excuse an absence. i get that they understand that a lot of people will try to get out of work school  without any consequences  when they are not actually sick  but they should not just assume that people are doing that - especially schools because it only goes to prove they feel they have more authority over your child than you do.
@davescrimshaw7781  true - so you have to shop around and interview them      i think i ve found a good one.
make sure you rinse your mouth well after using any inhalers. you can get thrush if you don t.
report her !!
evil crooks!
same for me i found the nurse practitioner at my local minute clinic was wonderful thorough and cared more than the nurse practitioner at my doctors office. notice i said nurse because i was never able to see an actual doctor in 2 years. though the doctors name is on my insurance card and i make appointments for the doctor i ve never even met. so i go to the minute clinic now.
none of us leave here alive. we are all going to die of something. live your life the best possible way with morals  love of neighbors  and focus on god. stay within you money budget. there are free things to do. even if it is to sit outside in good weather and watch the wildlife. god bless.
nurses i know have quit their careers because of the complete shift in healthcare.  the care is no longer there.  the hippocratic oath doesn t mean anything today in the rockefeller-based medical world.
when i got covid couple years back and called my dr. - he flat out told me to go to the er! i didn t  i toughed it out  and it was tough indeed. i guess we have to be our own dr s now for small things that don t kill us. although i did feel i was going to die. it was scary!!! hugs from arizona.
welcome to modern american medicine. maybe cross the southern border to get proper medical attention.
see doctors that take cash only  they are not under insurance and government regulations. usually they work out a payment plan as well.
if you real god s word you should be fasting. a gift from father to help heal your spirit and body.
i m not sick i have good health but i need to go to the doctors for a physical. i m not looking forward to it i m in a apartment program for people with special needs they require me to go to the doctors.
will i learn anything useful in the online course  the course description doesn t really tell you have you will be equipped to perform any medical care. i can t attend out of state classes.
try chiropractor
doctors are like cars. you gotta shop around. if the car don t feel right  you don t keep taking it around the block hoping something will improve  wasting gas doing so. why would you not do same with a doc  my mother gets horrible care  complains all the time  but refuses to get a new doctor you get what you are feared into receiving.
i m over weight  i smoke  i eat whatever i want  i don t have the greatest hygiene  i even let my pets sleep in my bed with me but  every time i go to the dr. he seems like he doesn t care!!!
all doctors aren t the same it sounds as if you got an unstable quack .
god bless you for speaking out!
i am  doctor coded as a vax resister  which i am.quercetin zinc vit e and b and c and go find out about nac.
@moscowcowboy_13 do they have homeopathic drs in fl
change doctors until you find someone sane.
@tonynjanet1  my chronic uti was caused by candida. finally got it under control.
fire her and change doctors. there are those that are old school and actually care about people. find and support them.
let me start off by giving god almighty the glory!!!  it is through him and by him that i move and have my being.over 8 yrs ago i was having the worse stomach pains  side pain  on my liver side  and in my back. the doctors i was going to couldn t really find much. i was told i had a fatty liver  with things attached on it.  i forget what they called them  i eventually had my gallbladder out because they said it could be the problem. the medications were many. and the pain was gone for a week or two after the gallbladder surgery. only to return. so i guess the gallbladder wasn t the problem. one day while crying out to god. i felt in my spirit him tell me to lay all the medications down and trust him for the healing. so that is exactly what i did. because i have always had a hatred of medications and having to take them.i have gotten better just from laying it all down. i still pick up soda here and there  more than i would like to admit. and sugar and junk food too of course. but i have not been sick or had pain. i had a cold flu not sure exactly what i was 2 yrs ago. it last for 3 days. even then i got out in the sun and walked  drank lots of liquids and chicken noodle soup. i am still doing great all praise and thanksgiving goes to my creator  my healer  my sustainer  my heavenly father jesus christ!!!  hallelujah!!!
get a naturopathic dr.
@naturescapesstudio  i went to the chiro when i broke my leg to get a 45 dollar x-ray and treated myself with her suggestions.
find another doctor! i m in florida and sought out a functional doctor. excellent decision!
@donnamullins2089  totally agree.
i stopped paying monthly health insurance premiums about 10 years ago. i try to eat fairly well and stay fairly active. i go to the doc pa once every 3 months and pay a  95 cash-pay  just to get my basic generic meds refilled. blood work up once a year. saved about  700 mo for 10 years.
same   they are like that about the jab  even the alternative ones.  never experienced anything like it.   i can t understand it.
it s simple when you keep yourself educated.
beautiful and intelligent  always look forward to your videos. patriot nurse always has something to bring to the table!
wisdom.
because it s coming from the holy spirit  she s just a conduit.
she s also been doing it since 2009 at least.  but as mentioned before yes the spirit does speak through her
so so true!
truly she is anointed by god.  i ve followed her for years and this woman of god has always been spot on.  gby and may he have mercy on us all.
@marc leveck   absolutely agree my bro!
the woman just flows with it
i m always amazed that she s been doing this chicken little routine of  the sky is falling  for five years now and you people still watch!  apparently  the doomsday clock has a  snooze  option
@theversipelis  she brings truth and knowledge to us  on all levels. so that people can have more of an informed based decision. she great and much appreciated. so if no one else will say it i will. your a hater  conversation ends here.
@theversipelis   i understand your point. mainly all of the conversation and topics can stir up fear. fear can be a good thing  believe it. just don t let it control you. she s just trying to inform us. the best way she can in the event that things do happen. it s better to be prepared as possible as you can for any situation. better to have and not need it. then to need it and not have it. that s what it all boils down to. take the knowledge and appreciate it. it just might help you and you might be thankful later.
@theversipelis  and yet here you are listening.
@priscillapurebottom734   actually  i listen to her about 5 years ago  yet  she still comes up on my feed. still the same ol chicken little routine. i believe another 5 years and you will still find her here  doing the same routine. your fear pays her bills
absolutely need the fire that doctor and find another one go in and research and see what their ratings are and then pursue them. if you have to do you like lucy is taking applications to pick a good one but i get rid of that one she s goofy!!!
smart and pretty!
russia will win! no matter...
god wins
i had surgery as an infant  phyloric stenosis. my esophagus was sealed up. they damaged the flapper. i am 61. i need the meds. the vinegar makes it worse.
@consco3667  could you possibly have vitamin deficiency   dr. berg has a video about vitamin deficiency and heartburn.  i can appreciate that your body has been altered as far as the mechanics  but this still may help you.
i love both of those docs! another doctor is dr mandell aka motivational doc.
also dr sten ekberg.dr ekberg also sells nothing.he goes to great detail.his charts   graphics explain difficult concepts clearly.he s my favorite overall.
berg is great. also  look up dr. darren schmidt. he has a youtube channel and runs his practice out of michigan. cheers.
i drink 2 kombuchas a week.  my reflux was so bad i was throwing up in the sink at night.  starting in w kombuchas.  boom.  gone.  doctor didn t even know what kombuchas were.
we love eric berg in this household.
dr john campbell is an excellent trustworthy dr-  especially about that shot.
facts. if you haven t taken patriot nurses classes i highly reccomend them. i went in-person  but she also has online clssses now.
doctors went on strike in israel twice.  this resulted in an article in  i believer  the nejm. the article was titled death takes a holiday. it was morticians who began to ask questions when their buniness was slowing so substantially they asked what changed
i. oils have told you that 40 years ago. but glad you figured it out.
i did the holistic route after the nurse at my primary physician s office refused to see me for a bladder infection  because i m not jabbed! i ve cured a chronic illness and feel amazing!
@stewbugz5213  what do you do for bladder infections holistically
@mpashleyfly  i don t have bladder infections on the regular. i had one during lockdowns and the nurse would not call me back due to not being vaccinated. i did have interstitial cystitis during that time. it started in 2018. i now do a combination of holistic treatments that have cured me around 95 .
it s in the best interest of the medical profession that we all get sick and stay that way! like they say follow the money trail  it is written   the love of money is the root of all evil !!
@consco3667  when you have a structural issue none of those things are tolerable. i have a hiatal hernia   i will not have surgery to correct it. i can t tolerate lemon water  acv or turmeric. i tried. the same things don t always work for everyone.
@sandyjuntunen4088  same here!!  and i m an herbalist!
awesome!!
@sandyjuntunen4088  he is actually a nurse with a doctorate degree  experienced in teaching nurses and doing extensive thorough research.
your so right. you need to take care of yourself and i luv dr. berg
i use baking soda to control acid reflux. the trick is keep your body in an alkaline state.
i ve agreed in the past with the two doctors you listed.  dr. mandell is quite different and really brings more to the table which berg and berry do not.  berg btw is a scientologist and his wife keeps tabs on his behavior for the church of scientology.  their son broke away from that life and has told of some issues.  mrs. berg supposedly spies on dr. berg.  i always thought there was something odd about him but after watching both him and his wife on one episode i noticed some more things that seemed odd.  he does give great info and i still watch but realize he s giving scientology millions of   and is deep within that not a real church.  hang in there.
doesnt the foods  drinks one consume cause acid reflux and water taken with a few grains of salt  helps the cells absorb  water  which helps with dehydration which seems to be the cause of much dis-ease.   maybe check out the book...i m not sick  l m just thirsty.  lt s quite eye opening. those doctors are pretty good though.
@sandrajohnson9926  his is a scientologist who has abandoned his son
same - dr. berg helped me with using acv for acid reflux.  it was patriot nurse that started pointing me in the right direction.  she and dr. christopher has inspired me to make my own ginger infusion that has been very helpful also.  recently i have found gary brecka - that s been helpful too.  thanks for the recommendations  i ll check these other doctors out.
@mariongould4173  hi  in my quest to be more healthy my mom begged me to stop drinking so much water and substitute it with electrolytes.  i started drinking cold chamomile tea instead of plain water and within days my scaly elbows were gone and so was my thirst.  hoping this might help you.
@newenglnd-kk9zz  i am with you on that.  i stopped watching him because of his belief.  his son exposed him and now he is after his son.
dr. eric berg isn t a dr.he is a chiropractor and scientologist. nuff said!
@sandyjuntunen4088  he promoted the jab in the beginning...
i like dr eric berg him also.
me too! my husband   i got healthy because of these 2 doctors. we ve been doing healthy keto and if for over 5 years and have them to thank for weaning us off the sad diet.
@yukonstriker1703  but at least he was smart enough to see the error of his way when presented with the research.
omg i loveeeeee dr eric berg
@evechavez2089  just any kind of coconut oil
@mtngr1  raw coconut oil . look up oil pulling.
@evechavez2089  i just started the coconut oil pulling. good to hear!
try brushing your teeth with baking soda and salt if anything it will help with the pain. it doesn t taste the best but helps me so if it works or helps let me know and others. god bless.
@stewbugz5213  which holistic remedies did you use to help ease  the interstitial cystitis
@greeneyes6311  tens unit therapy  organic food  no gluten  no dairy  pumpkin seed oil  collagen  organic bovine . i did have pelvic floor physical therapy too.
@robertlawson698  that s a huge generalization. and largely untrue
you should try fasting and doing a carnivore diet for at least some many months. see how you do.
i heard that med students were told that  a healed patient is a loss of income .  i was stunned to hear that.  i was out shopping at sprouts  i think it was sprouts and struck up a conversation with a young woman and learned that she was a med student.  i asked her if med students were being taught that a healed patient was a loss of income and she said   yes .  then we got into discussing ethics and morals
@stewbugz5213  thanks for your info. glad it worked for you! i ve had a few uti s in the past  pure cranberry juice   cranberry capsules cured the last few. i have a friend who might have interstitial cystitis so i ll relay this to her. thanks again.
@greeneyes6311  i believe the preservatives in food are definitely a big problem for me. so tell her to buy as much organic as possible. also i have found high histamine foods cause flares as well. it s a awful illness. i wish her well!
i go to dentist always. covid did not stop that service in iowa a republican state. have a great dentist i pay cash.
so glad to hear you are doing much better.
if medicine has turned into a business. the fault is multi factorial. people keep voting a certain way and demanding health insurance. and benefits. now you have  big health networks and drs don t have autonomy.  and there are pressures on them to join or fail. you can t just blame  docs.  most people who go into hc have a heart to take care of others. it s the system  is patriot nurse just doing this to make money    if you want change. people have to start speaking up and support voting a different way.
good on your mom and dad !!
@craigcosgray9362  why not just floss and using baking soda. less damaging and toxic
@stewbugz5213  i believe the preservatives in two of my dogs  food caused problems and so got them on homemade   raw and they do much better. so  no doubt  the preservatives are not the best for humans  either. also both my friend and i eat mostly organic foods but i ll tell her about the potential high histamine connection. i have allergies  etc. and so am cutting way back on strawberries as they re high histamine.  good to know this info stew! thanks again.
time for some mms.   jim humble..  works.
@mtngr1  i would say the purest you can find  but as always  do your research first before buying.
@nvalles2565  - that s what i was going to carnivore 100
why would you cure your customer aka reducing your customer base income. of course it s set up to make more profit
how did you solve your mouth dental issues
great !     we re avoiding all of that  pro. med. garbage.  had serious misgivingsabout their purposes a long time ago.   stay with how you know to get  wellness  !
good for you  as a boomer i do not go to a medical doctor  especially aftermy sister  who is a nurse  was forced to take the cvd19 vax. my sister was never the same..
i have to say i took ivermectin and my gum disease was gone after 2 doses
what hollistic communities did you reach out to for dental needs
try colloidal silver gel overnight in a tooth guard
@randommichael  good advice i take silver and helps the amt of colds i get..and the duration
do you even floss bruh
@crow13b  not anymore.  it s a long story about how my mouth got so bad. i stayed with the same dentists  orthodontists  and oral surgeons my whole life. they have now since retired. i am 62. but at 15 years  i was experimented on my baby teeth were yanked  braces put on.   4 years of wearing braces . the good dentist told me they learned from trying out new procedures and now know it was wrong to yank all these teeth and pull my permanent teeth down   stuck in my upper and lower gums  in a 2  hour surgery.   my baby teeth never fell out. anyhow   my gums were terrorized.
@greeneyes6311  also oil of oregano capsules  nature s antibiotic. it s especially good for urinary tract infection. it works for me!
have you tried hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse
@truthwins9044  hydrogen peroxide too.
@lisa jarvie is doing it now.
your doc is probably not a rockefeller-based doctor.
where or how can i find such a dr
private health associations for health private education associations for educationprivate membership associations for tax free purchases of everything you need herd shares for meat and eggs
i heard about those years ago done work like a monthly subscription cost
sounds like you were blessed to find a trustworthy reliable physical to help you.we hope not to ever need one    but did find one i m pretty sure is trustworthy !
that s amazing! how did you search  i m looking to help my parents out with medical stuff
if i could find that and depend on it  i d retire.
medical co ops are popping up around the country.   they are very affordable and effective. just make sure to supplement w  a catastrophic insurance policy if  heaven forbid  you develop chronic illness like a cancer or have a car accident.
i m in south carolina
how do you go about finding one of these doctors  im trying to start a family and id like to even use a midwife for birthing. i just dont trust the idea of medical care as an enterprise
wow  what happened to respecting   honoring the elders   they want to live long   prosper like everyone.
@sandyjuntunen4088  you are correct. i recall a 60 minutes show a long time ago when amsterdam was implementing it.
in multiple states now there is a legal form of  un-living   called v.s.e.d.  or  voluntary stop eating or drinking . i believe a dr has to sign off on it and those who do it don t get hospice but can get palliative or comfort care towards the end. it can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to a month depending on if the  patient  drinks some water or not. i think so far it s only legal in  blue  states...
@sugrmag3  what you say is true  but this is quite different from euthanasia.
@kimberlybrown4912  agreed  but it s now considered an option for terminal patients and those who soon will be. it s becoming  normalized   as is so much in our desensitized world.
@barrystalder3137 if they are all to be saved.
@barrystalder3137  that is a personal choice
@sugrmag3  it is not normal to euthanize a human being! as a nurse who has walked with others  and my parents  through a terminal illness and death  it is a personal decision as to what comfort measures one chooses. i recall a chaplain coming to talk to my class in nursing school  a long time ago  about end of life. when a person gets older the body becomes frail. rendering cpr can actually cause more harm than good  chest compressions can break frail bones  . it behooves an individual to research different interventions and make personal decisions for his her own care. i was quite surprised to see how long a person can stay alive without sustenance if a decision had been made to not eat. please note  once a person has decided to  let go  of this life due to being exhausted by their illness or simply ready to move on  no longer eating is a natural response. personally  i am a strong supporter of palliative and hospice care. it allows the client dignity and respects their choices  without compromising morality .
we talked about it when i was in 4th grade because we were the cusp babies.  boomer gen x  think of the trillions our country has wasted since that point instead of investing our money  our collected social security  as well as wall st invested it s own.
@craighaveman2125  spot on and well said. the minute you show actual evidence they lose their minds.
i ve been hearing about it since late 90s. have yet to see it.
@userxyz0  i remember back in the 90 s jared taylor would go on certain shows and talk about this and diversity and they would attack him like crazy. all he was doing was telling the truth and showing the data.
wow! sounds like doctors who made house calls in the 50 s   60 s.  i didn t know they still existed  where do you go to the doctor     how do you find them
@sonshineanita  a friend referred us to this particular doctor. had to sign up and get on a waiting list for about a month. also does a sit down interview with you and your family to make sure everyone is comfortable and understands. as others have noted  this trend is growing and you can do some research to find one locally.
@ellywoman777  our dr has a local office that we go to. keeps many meds on hand and does most of the work there unless needed offsite. will also barter   exchange with other patients for service.good network to be a part of if things go sideways.
love this idea. i will be looking for myself this same type of practice.
that is how it should be. how in the world did you find a doctor that operates like this    i wouldn t have a clue where to find a doctor like that.
dr. demento
don t grieve for your sons and grandchildren.  fight for them with all the time left you have on this earth.
@mitzi73  i will grieve for them for not having the freedoms i enjoyed in my lifetime. as for fighting for them . i do as much as anyone in their senior years can do. i educate  encourage and pray for them. in truth  the fight belongs to the next generation.
@kimberlybrown4912  well said kimberly!
prayers to nz from usa. best wishes for you.

i have extra food for me and some for my kitty some water. i live in colorado in the suburban area it s hard to prepare to much because i m in a apartment program for people with special needs. i need some help to live independent.
haka spirit  kiwi! strong and brave as a swagman! crank up some  waltzing matilda    put on some billy tea and damper. i have recently studied your culture and find it fascinating! hope i remembered some of the points correctly! p.s. having a personal relationship with jesus christ and praying for discernment is gonna a crucial factor in our near future
can you please elaborate further
@axltyler  weather and solar cycles are not  global warming .  in addition  one large volcanic eruption emits more  greenhouse gasses  than all of humanity for all time. elaboration complete.
at least they are open to listening.  anymore   that s a good start against the stone heads.
i will ask my friend the details again. will post on monday
@carportcarl  thanks. i m really interested in learning more about your point!
@axltyler  what part of that didnt you get  all stuff you can simply figure out yourself.
old navy brat here  of the many things my father warned me about throughout my life  i ll share three. never put anything in writing and believe only half of what you see and nothing you hear. stay close to god.
yet we have to try
that does not mean i will give up. ever
@consco3667  never give up never give in. i estimate i will live maybe 2 weeks once shtf. there s just me.
@tomcraig5219  i am 61 and fit. we live remotely. wife is 54 and fit. i would guess we could   with our neighbors   make it for up to a year. all depends on the shtf scenario. i am with you brother  never quit with a breath still left to give.
i agree with you.  many will die and suffer.  we could end up with anarchy.
@marcpedneault3362  we will !!!
that s where faith kicks in.... we do as much as we can as well as we can and know that no matter what  god has got us in the end.
tom  i am 67 and i know we are toast  yet i will keep trying right up till the end.  assuming i am not overran by mauraders  i think we could make a month or two maybe even three.  as much as i think it is going to happen within the next year or so  it may not.  maybe common sense will prevail  again no matter how much i doubt it.  i however really hope that if it does happen  i manage some sort of honor guard before i go.
@axltyler  youve been on here 16 years and dont get it   thats self explanatory.
@rushfan9thcmd  was i talking to you  no  i was talking to carportcarl.
@rushfan9thcmd  not interested in hearing from your ego.
how can we blame ppl for a natural occurrence  if the planet didn t constantly change over 5 billion years then you might have an argument. however  there is real data that proves the planet has always warmed and cooled. we know for a fact that during the end of the roman empire the earth was 10-12 degrees warmer. we re actually in its most stable climate in a long time. 100 years for earth is like a second for us. humans have contributed to the climate but it s 1 1 000th compared to natural phenomena. one continuous volcano puts out more greenhouse gases in one week than all the vehicles in america in a year! there are 30  in the world that never stop spewing. one mass eruption pumps out more gases every minute than all humans do in a year. add in methane gas releases  a warming sun  natural tree and plant rot and it s no contest. the wef un refuses to even hear out   real scientist  bc they know it s all a huge lie to gain power.
@carlpaul2918  exactly
@axltyler  i will on monday
@axltyler  i will ask my friend the specifics and share on monday
@carportcarl  no rush  fellow. i understand you were replying to me the first time.
@johnwurfel2862  yeah man !
@rushfan9thcmd  dude just asked a question that maybe you could help with or not   why waste time trying to belittle or hate on people   try loving on people !
@carportcarl  very interested to hear it.
here it is!  my engineering friend said the atomic weight of carbon  co2  is 44 while standard earth atmosphere is 29.  if carbon was increasing at an exponential rate death valley would be saturated with co2 and you couldn t breath there.  higher atomic weight than atmosphere would cause most co2 to sink to lowest points on earth.  this is why one of his young coworkers got it.
@axltyler  answer posted
eisenhower warned of this in his farewell address
@arbonnelady5583  posted in this string  look for my entry started with here it is
i believe you. no one s really ready.
y all are correct. we ve lived through enough to see what s coming. i m thankful for my faith and discernment not to believe any of the stuff that s going around these last few years. we ve seen enough to know it s moving at an extremely fast pace now. we ve got to live in reality.  i m also thankful for those like you all that will be right there with me. we will need our friends and neighbors of like minds.
newly retired army here my husband was in airforce and my son is navy aviation overseas now finishing 1st term. i try telling people no one is ready or have clue on what s happening most don t know history of all the countries that s led up to where we are now and our country is on bottom and they are looking for retribution.  i am cbrn in all medical unit for combat hospital and have nursing degree and was in commissioning program to be pa. i am not ever getting back in medical field as it s a mess and against everything i know and believe.  we avoid hospitals and doctors best we can. most are arrogant and wrong and end up in more trouble like i did at hand of doctor that messed me up for life. the military isn t ready and even less so on civilian side.
so  honest question... do you think there s anything we should or could  be doing  at all ...
there are those of us that will not comly with being murdered.
to be fair..   i came to this planet for a show..  perhaps this is it
you are exactly right... sda s have a prophet by the name of ellen white. look what she says of the crisis that is ahead of us   transgression has almost reached its limit. confusion fills the world  and a great terror is soon to come upon human beings. the end is very near. god s people should be preparing for what is to break upon the world as an overwhelming surprise. the  time of trouble  such as never was   is soon to open upon us  and we shall need an experience which we do not now possess and which many are too indolent to obtain. it is often the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality  but this is not true of the crisis before us. the most vivid presentation cannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal. now is the time to establish a relationship with god. he will see his people thru to the end.
@ivylagrone8632  create an alternative food source such as raising livestock to eat. you cannot stockpile enough extra storable food for that to be a viable solution.
@godscommandmentsaretruthis2837  which ellen white book does she say this please - god bless
@helenbarber5980  i combined two of her quotes 1.   transgression has almost reached its limit. confusion fills the world  and a great terror is soon to come upon human beings. the end is very near. god s people should be preparing for what is soon to break upon the world as an overwhelming surprise.   the signs of the times november 21  1906  paragraph 32. the  time of trouble  such as never was   is soon to open upon us  and we shall need an experience which we do not now possess and which many are too indolent to obtain. it is often the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality  but this is not true of the crisis before us. the most vivid presentation cannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal.  the great controversy  1888 edition  page 622.3
by remaining in a positive frame of mind  adapting to the circumstances you find rather than those you expected  having a sense of humor  all of the above are as important   in some cases more important  than gadgets and stockpiling. people will make the difference  knowledge and skills plus the right attitude .     material considerations are almost as important.
@daleeasternbrat816        agree.  we need to remember that our species has lived through crises of all kinds. we have what it takes  we are adaptable  we have ingenuity and we are good at working together. we need to stay well-informed  ignore mainstream media and keep our wits about us. it s all about attitude. vive la resistance!
i m 70 and very healthy  no lifestyle diseases or rx meds. i stay healthy by avoiding doctors!
@tomcraig5219  my husband and i discuss this frequently.  he is 73  i m 62  fairly healthy  active on our homestead  as self sufficient as we can be.  however  we both realistically have discussed that if shtf we are probably not going to be around much longer. we will do our best  lean on the lord but realistically age will get the best of us.  i can see yearly the toll it is taking healthwise and as i said we are in better shape than many our age.  we will fight the good fight but are realistic about the future. i think just trying to grasp what the shift mentally will do to many of the older generation  we will need to adapt in such a significant way. on the positive side our families will hopefully benefit from the knowledge we have left them as well as the preps.
@allison speer  i have updated my body armor and now i estimate i along with the neighbors will make it much longer. getting organized
this boomer spends his days smoking cigars  nights drinking beer  and time in between reading things that make me think i am doing the right things smoking cigars and drinking beer.
this boomer spends his day at work i don t know how you have the money to do all that but good for you.
this boomer spends her mornings training  afternoons prepping and evenings shooting laser bullets at whomever i can t stand on tv.  lots of targets these days!we are toastamerica has already fallen.- sigh -
what are you going to eat
i can attest to that fact  i took patriot nurse s in-person class. outside of my my bible  it s the best money i ever spent.
we artificially keep dying people alive. sorry more natural death would be moral and logical.
gr8 to see you here florida marquis!!i love your channel!!vaya con dios
tom anderson  that s what long term care does. it keeps people alive that would normally have died only a couple of generations ago. people are living longer in worse condition than ever before  dying slowly over a long time instead of on a natural timeline.
there aren t enough of us. we ll have to get the robots to do it.
you are fortunate you have not had any unexpected medical bills come up  but if you have even so much as one family member that say has a ruptured appendix  or gets hit by a car  has a heart attack  an injury to the eye  cancer  or has a badly broken bone or needs a big surgery you are likely to lose everything you have worked for your entire life. they will come for your house and any assets you own to make you pay that bill.  a simple hospitalization  er visit outpatient  or surgery is going to run in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. i agree insurance companies are crooks  but there are the alternatives you can buy like the ones where groups of people all buy in and you at least have some coverage if something goes wrong. to think you won t ever have an emergency or an unexpected health issue  through no fault of lifestyle or behavior  is a fool s errand. being healthy is often just good luck and it can change at the drop of a hat through no fault of your own. life is tragic for all of us  and eventually tragedy will find you too at some point  or will affect someone you are very close to.
i have mild allergenic asthma. i would love to never need another inhaler but i can t quite get there. any ideas
@jercasgav  we have dealt with brain tumors  emergency appendectomy  multiple concussions  compound broken bones  a miscarriage that required hospitalization  wounds requiring stitches  etc.  we have found ways to minimize the attention received for those events and a variety of ways to pay the bills.  when you don t have insurance because it s too expensive for a large family you become more self reliant and rely on god to guide you.  we have learned that simplicity in care is very important.  preventative care also important.
my friend the professor plans on doing exactly this.
no. people should not be made to do those things.
there should already be no phones in school! we weren t allowed to bring a gameboy  so wtf
she is a great truth seeker and sage!
so true! been telling people this for years. they change labels often and practice deception as their master has taught them.
like it or not she is actually a part of what your talking about. it s part of how her tribe works. they tell you what they are doing to you. she s no savior by any means  quite the opposite.
@bigblock427ful   can you please elaborate
i agree completely.
@connie027   he s not a troll  what he says is true.
this!!!!
anyone who doubts this should read  the protocols of  the elders of zi n     it is very enlightening.
@gwaygway1  thanks.
let s talk i got something for you.
amen!@
i agree!!!
fantastic condensed overview of the day we are living in.
yes! i don t need to be told to hit the notifications button.  i did it because when a video is made i watch listen asap. yes i watch patriot nurse s videos more than once to let her message sink in.
absolutely  she is the best for information on all levels
i ve been following your commentaries for a few years now and am always impressed with the breadth and depth of your insights.  your most recent analysis is  i think  very insightful  and i fully agree with your assessments.  i m 70 years old and an army retiree with 25 years  service  most of it in intelligence.  the only additional factors i would add to your commentary is that we are most likely undergoing a huge psyop designed to instill a distrust in us  of our national institutions  our western cultural values and accomplishments  and to indoctrinate our children in sexuality and perversions in order to sever them from the religious and cultural heritage of their ancestors. you are right that we are about to enter into a period of change in the western world which most of us  especially folks my age  will be unable to fully comprehend or successfully contend with. my advice is to stockpile what you can  hunker down  and immerse yourself in daily prayer as you establish a personal relationship with god. no matter what may happen  god is involved and has a plan.  we were all born to be alive in this time and place. it isn t happenstance.
it s always a treat to see you and hear your viewpoints.  being fairly new in the retirement world  i am somewhat concerned about the next 5 years or so  as the rumblings in our foundation are getting louder.  i need to sharpen my fishing skills and am thinking of pursuing hunting  just in case  and hope to soon have a critter or two running around the barnyard when i get one.  and here i thought i d be swinging in the hammock and sipping a mint julep when i retired!    and thanks for the john adams quote- i m going to circulate that one everywhere i can.  people trying to totally separate god from our republic aren t thinking rationally.
boomer here  class of 56.  agree completely with your assessments.  i keep asking - who are you  really   you are so clear and concise and insightful  you have such a solid grasp of what s happening behind the blue smoke and mirrors. glad to know that there are others who see it this way too. thanks for all you do for us  hope to see you on the other side.   take care sister.
knowledge tells us what we cant do  wisdom tells us what we should do  genius
i always look forward to your videos because you are one of the few people in this country who is actually capable of rational thought.  your assessment of what has been happening in the world is logical and your messages are honest and direct.  this video is no exception.  your evaluation of the current world situation is  unfortunately  very accurate.  your dedication to our lord makes your words worth listening to  and your advice important to follow.  god bless you sister.
i ve commented previously on how important your message is during these times. as we move into what appears to be a global reorganization   realignment. those that have taken action from your advice will prosper. now more than ever your content is the tough love we all need to hear and take action on. whenever a major event happens. i consult your channel for guidance and reaffirmation. you are in your moment. double down and preserve your strength. leaders and healers like you will be dearly needed.
thank you! our family in wisconsin has been experiencing rapid expansion of knowledge and wisdom related to growing our own food  preserving  storing that food  growing herbs  foraging in forests for medicinal plants and mushrooms and finally tincturing and performing water extractions of those herbs  medicinal plants and medicinal mushrooms. by the grace of god we are gradually divorcing from big pharma and big healthcare. god bless.
i am working through your online course as we speak.  loving it!  thank you  patriot nurse!
thanks so much for the information that you give us regarding the current situation that we are about to face!  as christians we need to pray and stand for jesus christ no matter what or who gets in the way!  we love you patriot nurse!!  stay strong and we shall meet jesus together sometime soon
you were totally right about the hospitals. so understaffed and overwhelmed  i had a much needed back surgery and had to spend two days in the hospital. i was very neglected and if i hadn t kept nagging the nurses i would ve suffered even more. they didn t stay on top of my post surgery pain and the sweet night nurse the second night got me back on track with some nurse magic. if she hadn t been there  i don t know what would ve happened. i m pretty determined to not ever have to go to a hospital again.
as a brit and god-damn-lousy-athiest  i ve had a pretty dim view of the world for many years. it saddens me that things are panning out how they are  all the love to those who can take love into their hearts. also many thanks to you patriot nurse for your continued work.
it would be incredibly smart to focus ai technology in the form of a shield  and also support roles. our enemies will use ai in the form of a sword  and if we are not prepared  they will cut us down.
live 15 miles from the train derailment in east palestine ohio. we re praying that we didn t get a lot of dioxins from the fires.
thank you and god bless you  patriot nurse. yes  we have hard times ahead  and we must prepare for the worst. one suggestion  though it s been demonized by those who do not have our best interests in mind  ivermectin is a marvelous drug. it won the nobel prize for very good reasons  and though it s hard to find in the usa  it is easily available from india. i got some at the beginning of the virus insanity  and i ve just ordered more  though the best remedy is to live a healthy lifestyle  eat proper foods  exercise  take vit. c   d  and then it s doubtful you ll get sick at all!
i cannot say it enough  you  young lady  are a truly amazing woman  far beyond your years in wisdom! may god continue to bless your ministry as we eagerly await his return for his bride.
you always have a very intelligent viewpoint.  i am again reminded as i work more and more towards self reliance    i need to learn more skills related to first aid and alternative medicine.
i appreciate this channel and this community of people and i am grateful for it. thank you pn.
the weakened of this society is the ideal of some leaders  it s happening before our eyes. great information for self-reflection. i was reading 1 kings 3 9 which i highly recommend it during these times.
my mother is 96 she lives at home with my sister  n u r right we all need to learn more in herbal medicine
patriot nurse you are amazing  your intuitive understanding of world events are incredible thank you god has blessed you with beauty and brains much love
i highly recommend chickens and dorper sheep.they re not trouble makers like goats  tend to shed their hair instead of needing shearing  are fairly docile. these are meat sheep. so between chickens and these dorpers  you will have a good source of protein..with minimal hassle.
unless you re referring to  class of  as date of birth  i don t believe you re a boomer...
@yellowcourier  date of birth.  i m dead-bang in the middle of the boom.
@george hopkins  never heard it said that way but you definitely are. i feel like you guys are the only generation to live out the full american dream. the one before built it and the ones after get to see it fall.
@yellowcourier  fair assessment.
amen.stand ...and stand firm in christ
yes.  no matter what !!!!!
it s the water i d be worried about
@beachinhonolulu5136  we are upstream from the water contamination.
holding your community close in prayer. that this administration will not help you is  heartbreaking but the american people will help however we can.
i believe you ve all been lied to. there is no way that area could already be safe!  i d get out!
leaving the area is probably the best thing to do. but if you don t leave  get several new air filters if your home uses those. change them every day for a few day at least and keep the used filters in plastic bag to save to have evidence of dioxin  vinyl chloride  etc. contamination.also run portable air purifiers and change filters a lot!
@mercyonus5292  east palestine is in a completely different watershed that feeds into the ohio river. our water sources are totally different. i m more worried the air pollution and fallout.
i just watched doug and stacey and they explained why you should get out - watch it for yourself
@helenbarber5980  ok you have a house i can move into for free
@ioshvamcguirelg3140  i m not from the us  there was someone in the comments that said they would help  maybe you could reach out to a church in another area  did you look at the article that i mentioned  if you live alone i would sleep in my car some place maybe rent a trailer
@helenbarber5980  i do not live alone. i am a prepper and my house is stocked. i m currently commenting to you wearing an nuclear biological chemical gas mask. i do not have the financial means to just up and leave. this is my ancestral homeland. ever since my family received their land grant for serving in the continental army under george washington. you make it sound so simple  but it s not.
@ioshvamcguirelg3140  i don t mean to make it sound simple - i know that it is not  are you able to get your water tested
@helenbarber5980  i don t drink our water. only bathe. we are upstream from the water contamination. i am more concerned about the air
@ioshvamcguirelg3140  the episode is called - they re not telling the truth off grid with doug and stacey .could you ask for the air to be tested
@helenbarber5980  if anyone lives in east palestine yes they need to leave now. i m not disagreeing. we are having a hearing thursday on the derailment for pennsylvanians and i am going.
@barrystalder3137  sorry i don t understand
@ioshvamcguirelg3140  there was another off grid with doug and stacey saying to get a load of plants around the house as they help to clean the air .i hope that you get somewhere with the hearing
watch the water
@ioshvamcguirelg3140  do you know what direction the wind was blowing when they burned off the chemicals  what direction was the cloud moving   stay safe!
@dobreangel  it blew first north then north east. the hysplit map from noaa modeled it right over our county  but a model does not reflect reality. we need comprehensive testing done on the soil to know for sure.
the book back to eden. but a copy before you can t. it ll tell you all the basic from a very same minded doc.i personally enjoy it as a companion book to my b!bl3
buy the book back to eden  while you can still get it.it has pictures too but it s the basics you need for knowledge in this field as well as it can be used for advanced levels of care. written by a g-0-d fearing doctor
as time goes on and things get worse  my thought is we can not save ourselves from this. it s clear to me that christ has to be the one to fix this all when it s all said and done.
not trying to complain  but i m a few days from being 71 yrs old and love learning from you  but always have a problem trying to hear...is it possible to turn your volume up please...thank you for all your videos  really love them.
this is why 20 years ago i got into a trade. ai and robots wont ever replace electricians and plumbers. we are still staying busy and our wages are going up and up because of the demand for us.
once again  you nailed it -- this is what we all need to hear  think about  be wise about.
i really appreciate how you think things through and express yourself. off topic  i have artscroll books in my house  too.
i can see tech related coding jobs  school teachers  and even a portion of healthcare being taken over quickly.
you re looking good and sounding better! thanks for the chat pn  always value your thoughts and insights. take care lady
i ve seen the last vestiges of the victorian era fall away ..when i was young  the older teachers still had that old world sensibility.  it s amazing.
i always say that   knowledge without wisdom is worthless.
i totally agree. the lack of wisdom is our biggest challenge. seems like no one wants to lead in any way that would create any problems to their careers. don t rock the boat for any reason. a real leader leads follows or getsthe hell out of the way.
love your video s and your intelligence !!! thank you for what you do !!
change is a good thing     usually      the changes they have in store for us may destroy everything that we ve bled and died for up untill this point !!!!
missing your content is a crime!  please keep up the great work.  i have shared your channel with so many people
the recent train wrecks could make several states unfit for farming. it s time for people to shake themselves from the sleep of death and remember the american motto   in god we trust.
the younger generation talking the kids in their twenties don t seem to care about having much stuff and they re not buying as much which i ve noticed i think that s going to hurt the economy i agree with you there patriot nurse i also noticed they are a generation at likes to rent and not own their cars they don t like taking on physical responsibility when it comes to owning things they want someone else to take the responsibility for them that s the least what i ve been learning from the young guys i talk with i m not saying it s everyone in the nation but that s california for you
love the work you do beautiful patriot nurse! living in ky for me is somewhat of an isolated area from this tyranny.   eventually this will effect every corner of the earth
@thepatriotnurse i ve been listening to you for several years now and i appreciate all your work and content. it s all very informative and easy for everyone to understand even with no medical background. you are a great teacher! god bless you and protect you  i plan to take your online courses. just curious if they also qualify as ceus  ty
the more things change  the more we need to depend on the one who never changes.
i m a 3d artist and i m terrified about the disruption that the ai revolution is causing already in my industry. not a good time to be living in. reminds me of genesis 41 20
i have followed you for years. i have learned so much from you. been prepping since 2013
the sad thing is if 2 to 3 million of us worked together we could right the course of this country .if i could only get that many to work together !
revival has broken out at asbury college again and it has spread to at least one other college
a true statement! some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the lord our god. he is in control. we can do what we can do for the time being knowing full well that we win in the end.
@kimba1430  i believe it is too early to judge what is going on there. it takes time to see the  fruit  of such movements. i believe the  western  specifically the american  church needs instead to prepare herself for persecution.
stay close to the lord our redeemer always....anyone with eyes that see and ears that hear  time is short!
this is exactly why nothing will be done.  christ isn t coming.  he expects us to do something.
in a sense i agree with you  that we can not  save ourselves .  but we aren t supposed to save ourselves.  we are supposed to align ourselves with christ  do his will in our own lives  push back against the  powers and principalities   and there are many strategies for this   and we might have to resist even to the shedding of blood.we re supposed to be salt and light in the world.
try ear phones or ear pods.
or turn on captioning
happy birthday!
happy blessed birthday!!
you can also slow down the speed to hear her.  she does talk a little quick.  and  happy birthday!!!  i m not far behind you
have you ever tried to read closed captions  that s not easy with someone who talks as fast as she does !
i agree   i ve tried close caption and can t keep up miss a good part of it ! i m also elderly  i will try earbuds ! thank you for that idea .
i would try earphones with wire. do not wear wireless electronics on your body. they cause cancer. nor hold your cellphone to your head  or carry your phone in a bra or pants pocket. just saying. god bless!
and... happy birthday!
go plumbers!!!!
you got it buddy retired plumber here
i m a remodel  contractor that specializes in mid- high end interiors. i been through 5 plumbers over the past two years. guys do just enough to pass inspection. no one takes pride in their work anymore. i hope that you are one of the good guys.
@rjthomasindyusa  well i said electricians first because that s me. lol.
going into a trade is based. good money to be made there
they won t but what about the vans you use  . my friend is a plumber for 20 years now nearly and in u.k. they pushing for the change of vans otherwise he has to pay 4.5k a year just drive around his area due to the climate change shite and 15 minute cities !
@sarahmc8309     it won t hurt us... it will hurt you. we simply raise our prices. the demand for good tradesman are overwelming.  the  powers that be  will continue to do thins like this to squeeze the  little guy .  there intention is to destroy the middle class......
got a blue tooth tv or stereo  connect to those. its what i do for low volume vids.
am old trick is to put your phone in something metal  like a bowl.  it will amplify the sound.
i have a wireless bluetooth speaker.  it helps  a lot!
i partially agree. our schools need to keep pace with current technologies but neglect of the basics that make things work is a recipe for failure.
90  of my kids academic learning is done on computer. we need maybe one teacher for 500 kids nowadays.
i saw a story about an a.i. lawyer that was being used somewhere in the us  but only for minor cases. human lawyers are fighting to keep it out of court cases. a lawyer needs to have the consciousness  not just the programming  to be legally available  i guess. given some of the nonsense i ve read and seen in past court cases  maybe the a.i. would actually be more just compared to a cowboy lawyer helping the guilty get away with murder  literally . obviously  this is still a scary situation. it proves that the upper middle class is going to suffer some losses instead of it just being the lower class or lower middle class. i ve seen far too many white color professionals sticking their noses in the air because they honestly believe they will still have their wealth and their jobs when this is all over. clearly  the future holds something different.
@jacqulineard140  that s worrisome.

change is here to stay
change is here to stay so long as good does nothing.
@toryallan7967  the negative and positive aspects of change are our choice of course  however  change happens regardless. this world is the organic expression of the infinite and subject to perpetual change during it s expression . i heard a preacher make that statement  change is here to stay once   always loved how the ideas seem diametrically opposed but true none-the-less. carpe diem .
@timothymeadows8326  well said. if we sit on our couches and fail to act to protect our loved ones and our selves then the change that falls on us will be disproportionately bad. if we act as god bids us then the change that comes will be for the most part positive. that is change. another saying from my youth was  if it s to be its up to me . stay safe!
what makes you think change is usually a good thing
@daisyviluck7932  if things don t change    they stagnate and die
and they like to live in vans and make youtubes of what s inside cabinets  drawers and close-ups of foaming milk for their fancy coffees.
i think today s young people are very aware of how fragile life is  how unsure everything is   it just makes sense to pass as much financial responsibility on to another  as possible. they have seen 2 major recessions in 25 years  the really bad kind where people lose their homes.makes a person unwilling to commit to anything permanent  you can get real burned real quick. better to have the option of walking away.  that s not my mindset but i can understand people having it.
@thepatriotnurse._ just checking with you  did you send me an email to text you or was that spam
thanks! as always a very informative video
i want to thank you for all you do - have done - for me and others not able to actually support you  financially.  - the thing is - the information you have generously given  - has helped me - a lot.  and - you - sharing honestly with us me - let me know i am not alone.   that s it - i simply want to say thank you!.
i had a dream last night about something that is a no-brainer to women  but wouldn t occur to most men.in the dream  i was part of a small group that had banded together for survival and s had just hit the fan. the women sent the men out to acquire supplies at a supermarket. while the others immediately went to grab food  the thought occurred to me that the women would need feminine hygiene products. i went to that aisle and began filling my cart with those things. i was about to head to the baby aisle for diapers and other baby products when the dream ended.so  when making our preps  try to take into consideration things that you may not need  but are of vital importance to others in your group band tribe whatever.
i am turning 71 in 2 weeks. i ve been a rn for over 40 years and still have an active license. i am absolutely stunned at how far i have seen the quality  of healthcare plummet. i moved to a new home an hour and a half away from my doctor who i felt treated me with respect. i felt we were partners in my healthcare and was listened to. fast forward to my new location and i have already gone through two new ones who don t give a rip about me. the last one charged me  297 for just asking me questions and disagreeing with me about what i was experiencing in my own body. she never once touched me  no listening to my heart or lungs  no checking my legs for edema. no assessment what so ever. i am going to do the long drive to get to my former doctor. my other concern is the icd-10 code  tracking  of individuals who have made the informed decision to not get the injection  with the purpose of this tracking to eventually control where you can or can t go.
i know of a few people including myself who did not stay on fb  and a few who have talked about it but have not. i believe people who care anything at all about their future should be very careful what and who they follow from now on  looking forward to your next post !
so good to see you sister! i always look forward to watching your videos. god bless you and all that you do.
thank you for the 10 000-foot view of what s happening. sometimes we get so into our own little world  we miss the big picture. god bless.
i know this isn t related to the video subject but i was wondering if you knew how things are going for the maineprepper.  he was really the first prepper channel i started watching and thought he was a great resource for preppers.  i hope he is doing well but just wanted to ask   since i know you worked with him a lot in the past.  thanks
god bless you and your familythank you for your wise words please share this message with all you know
may god help your generation and the younger generations.  thanks for your insight.
found me a good gastro doctor  but the bosses forced his early retire. then found a good senior gp who took time   cared  and who bucked the local medical system that retired that gastro doc. in a year or so my gp disappeared...no reason given...nowhere to be found  because as i found out from a former one of his longtime patients...he fell into a lava flow while in hawaii. yep....and thats all folks! to whom it concerns  ty for not serving.....and ty for not caving to the clot shot jockeys.    ty pn!
thank you pn. you are a rare gem.
it s already changed and changing daily and the lies  holy crap. i m 63 and have never seen such a mess. nice video.
as always love ya and thank you so much for all you are doing to keep us informed etc.
there is a revival going on at asbury university.  it is spreading to other campuses. god may have some surprises in store. i agree with your main points  and i don t think the us will be the same. but a major christian revival here at this time of chaos -its in god s timing
be blessed my sister  thank you for your beautiful and timely message. you help me to keep my edge sharp! please keep investing your time and understanding on us. some will change and eyes will be opened.
great stuff  prepper nurse! wisdom beyond your years!  thank you so very much. god bless you in all you do for others!
thank you again pn  i pray you are well  god is faithful to his people  stay strong and be of good courage!
a great video presentation. the last minute of your video focused on our faith. yes   spiritual fitness  is first and foremost importance. appreciate you touching on that message. i know you too have great faith. keep in prayer people. it s not over yet. in fact  it s all just getting started. we fight not against flesh and blood........just take a look at the revival going on in ohio. it s spreading.......this is what it s all about.
very much agree about learning how to use herbs. my friend has found a way to make it simple for people to understand which has been very useful for me.
thank you!
for assistance offer s
let s talk i got something for you
. for assistance
thank you!  thought maybe you would be mentioning the growing and ongoing over a week 24 7 now revival in asbury ky. sounding like more to start all over the country and world.  people are turning to god in a big way.
i think the local community should be a focus for independence. i just feel a strong pull to  love thy neighbor.  if it came down to it and we needed to help each other  our neighbors  what does that look like  helping in our local communities and strengthening our local community by knowing our neighbors   i don t know exactly what that would look like  but in a time of need and history also shows  knowing who the neighborhood doctor is  who is the candlemaker  the dentist  the herbalists etc. those with other skills within the local community that can help. getting to know nearby farmers.  local independence  again  i don t know what that looks like  but it s on my heart more and more to love thy neighbor.
i so respect your words! thank you for this video! keep it coming! with god we will weather the storm! pray. plan. prep.
still following your female monthly protocol now for 2 years and still in shock how much better i feel!
you are correct  we are currently in a paradigm shift that s irreversible. find alternative methods of information rather than conventional media since it s being highly censored to manufacture political correctness and narratives to create new acceptable beliefs  values  behaviors  and socialization. perception is reality along with cognitive awareness that s easily manipulated. case in point  a fiat currency doesn t rely on solvency  it requires huge amounts of debt credit creation.
thank you-simply thank you  much appreciation for your knowledge your time and your compassionate nature that shares this information with humanity.
been watching for years always done with wisdom thank you pn!i liked it when you did the videos in the country  will you ever do those again
thank you as always for your valuable information
you are such a doll in so many ways.especially your heart  thank you for all that you do for all of us.   you can t fix stupid ! may god bless you and keep you safe.lynn
thank you for what you do.  i always enjoy listening to you.  may god continue to bless you and make a clear path before you so you can continue to do his will.
i thank the good lord that i have been prepping for decades. people aren t calling us paranoid anymore
shared! a big brain nurse is quite a force
another good eye opening lesson to learn!!
clear and concise.much appreciated.
i don t know how you guys all do it..  i don t understand how you pull all this together   but i m glad you do   and i believe we are in the last seconds on gods clock.
god put us in this generation and i know there was a reason  now it s time for understanding!
the nurse of patriots.  whoops hook. more videos please. you have so much knowledge.
one thing has become abundantly clear. the future belongs to those who are entering the work force and picking up the responsibilities of child rearing  not to those of us who are leaving the roles of responsibility. the enemies of the human race have long understood that capturing the minds and imagination of the very young is the key to capturing and influencing the future. we may not like it nor agree but no one is going to ask what we want.
spot on.  thank you for posting this information.
you are correct sir!!! mike t. born april 3rd 1963   self-aware almost immediately on the first day!!! that is prolly why my wife is 12 yrs. older than i  and i hardly ever had friends my own age.welp i sure am glad i quit watching tv 7 years ago  so that i learn from whom i can relate and verify thru research of how truthful and intelligent their profile appears to be  and then take a grain of salt with even that much. tell you what  even my teachers growing up were trying to tell us of what patriot nurse is posting today  but now their all gone and we have to be wary of who is out there power grabbing and stealing our children s mind and body!!! watchout  patriot nurse is correct sir!!!!
hi just watching new to pn   female protocol  would love a link..from adelaide australia
curious where to find this protocol!!
yes  i would like to know where to find this info.
following
amen.
so glad to catch a video of yours!  you are such an awesome  intelligent person.  we need your viewpoints   knowledge.
god bless you pn. you will never know how much we appreciate you and thank god for your willingness and obedience to be here and share wisdom  common sense and truth. may the blessings of yeshua be more than you can contain  in every area of your life. shalom dear sister in him
agree 1000  .thank you!!!
thank you for the facts . very helpful info.
i hope you are feeling better  patriot nurse. and that you are happy in mind and body. however  i know the firecracker in you is still alive and well. keep that trait serviceable. i m still praying for you and your family.
great stuff!! knowledge has created technology that has created devices that can easily be combined in many different ways to produce new devices. wisdom is lacking on how to limit the use of this technology. wisdom is lacking on what is moral and healthy in life as well.
totally agree. its a scary time. as a californian  as liberal as my state is  was  . being a child of immigrants  i always had a comfort in the greater united states and its values. being clothed in democracy and human rights. that was the result of post world war ii vietnam war etc. but like all things  everything changes and just like we dread getting up in the morning from a nights slumber  most of us can t just lay there the entire day as much as we would like to. we must go through this change and have faith in ourselves as a united people to not fear and create in the midst of the turmoil that is change so that we can once again be worthy of that  slumber  for the next generations to come. i do not like where our world is going as a united states citizen. but i also understand it is up to our generation to maintain the values we love. truth is  we have to fight for it like so many other americans did for us in the past. i have faith. i wish for all the patriots to also have faith in this time of  turmoil  and change. god bless!
one other thing on ai i haven t heard a lot of people talking about  but absolutely worries me. ai will be used by law enforcement agencies to  pre crime  people exactly like the movie minority report. instead of fictional psychics  they ll feed the computer all the details of every convicted individual and let the machine use its capabilities to predict who is a likely offender.when you add in the fact the data input process is biased  you can be sure unapproved views will be on their list for hunting targets. chatgpt proves its bias already when discussing charged subjects with it
there are decades where nothing happens  and there are weeks where decades happen.  vladimir lenin.
love you patriot nurse! thank you for your videos
i am 60 years old.  we grew up in the us hearing more about the never-ending fighting between two specific culture groups that i never met in person.  i always wondered what news occurs in ireland  china  montana and such.  but no  every single day  it s the fighting between these people  with tanks  missiles and more us backing vs. ragged children  throwing rocks.
thanks pn  the lord is obviously using you to guide those late to the party god bless
thank you pn for all you teach  .  .  .
thank you for taking the time to share your wisdom!
hello patriot nurse! good video! i wanted to see you in milwaukee last year  maybe next time. keep up the good work!
i really admire your strength and courage. you are a light in this darkness. thankyou for shining the way.
i work as a travel nurse and have seen people spending days in the ed waiting for a bed  not only that but nursing homes are turning down patients because they dont have staff  or are full and these people are staying in hospitals and those floors are becoming like nursing homes with patients staying 6  months in hospitals waiting for a nursing home bed
i agree. well said!
a beautiful mind! a wonderful synopsis on reality  thank you.
we no longer teach critical thinking skills. i was born in 62. the tail end of the  baby  boomer generation.  i guess people my age are the last to be taught critical thinking. i really worry about my grandchildren.  the generations that came after me are totally ignorant.  they can t answer simple questions.  they are too addicted to social media. they look at tic toc yet never actually find out real history.  yet  they have all the information they need at the tip of their fingers.

hey doc. thank you very much for the video. i wish you had better news. it s really scary out here  especially up in this very blue run state of new jersey.too many rules and regulations  and i m kind of trapped here as my mother needs care and the same with my sister.. again thanks for the video.
i like your videos   thank you for your work
patriot nurse  we love you and god bless you and keep you safe  for without you  sounding the alarm  and attempting to wake people up  we would not stand a chance.  nor would we stand a chance without our savior s love!
retired from nj  cop job  and moved to tennessee. your videos are unlike any i ve watched but extremely incite full.  i m very close to knoxville  soooooooooo hope to see you in april.
the judge got only bruen wrong  bruen only eliminated the public interest balancing test  tht was already in heller   but also heller  commonly possessed for lawful purposes  not only self defense
i really enjoy  your videos.. straight to the point and dead on.. .  how did you get so smart   lol
i am a boomer  but our family traditionally does not retire and we tend to live into 90 s and more.  i have been mormon my entire life and have never broken the word of wisdom our health code  no smoking alcohol  drugs   caffeine and so on.  i farm 260 acres pretty much alone and work 20 of 24 every day of the week except sunday.  i have a medicare pcp who i rarely vist even when it is demanded.  i am now seeing an alternative md and am debt free and can live off grid.  more than likely i will be feeding a lot of younger than 30 year olds who never learned how to work hard and take care of themselves.   i have a lot of medical and nursing background.  this is a great channel.  i did get the first series covid vac and had covid twice  first time almost diud not make it.  i definiely had a vac reaction causing pain and vascular changes in my legs  using dippler it appeared to be some clotting issues.  i have not been vacced since adn will not.  the vascular changes have resolved after a year and using some edta and more.....we ned to be able to care for ourselves the best we can.
just love your heart! so grateful for you. in such a dark world your light shines like a beacon! blessings to you!
prayers for you and your family as you are the awake and aware and caring for those weak whom you love.
you are a very intelligent and brave lady . please never stop . thank you . god bless you patriot nurse .i love you !
as a 31 yr rn  i am saddened to think of the years ahead  esp 4 my child and sil...it s heartbreaking to see what d.c. has done purposely to this country...i was and am a supporter of djt and know he had our best interest in mind..but sadly he is for a season only.  i do not see america in the book of revelation  we all know that.  i see  working for a company that does in-home care  how depleted resources are and if u cannot pay for it u r sol.  i think even preppers will suffer  but i pray no one does.  i grieve for this country my family has fought for since 1776 and know our only constant is christ....god bless and ty patriot nurse...
hey pn   thankyou for an excellent truth report   good to see you again  god bless you.
things have already changed dramatically from my childhood
thank you again dearheart  those of us who know our bible can see very plainly what is coming and the contractions are coming more rapidly every day . shalom
your energy is contagious!.....as is your knowledge!
totally agree on the ai thing. many jobs will get eliminated. i ve seen estimates of 800k by 2030.
so good to see you and learn from you. you articulate in a way that makes it very eye opening and easy to understand. thank you former smokey mt boy
great info as usual.
thank - you for keeping us alert ! from ct
please be safe patriot nurse! i worry about your safety when you give us such good intel!!! love ya and please be safe! god speed
excellent analysis
can you do one of your prayer sessions when. everyone gathers  i love when you do this  -  and i think we can all use it
very wise information. thank you.
this isn t the 1940s  i can t imagine any kind of rationing system working today like it did during the war. certainly it would be a logistical mess  probably an excuse for some kind of digital biometric id. also  back in the 40s almost everyone still had family in the countryside and that helped with the food supply. now there are 30-something people who have never seen a garden  i know some.
therefore be careful how you walk  not as unwise men but as wise  making the most of your time  because the days are evil. so then do not be foolish  but understand what the will of the lord is.   ephesians 5 15-17
wow!  powerful inspiration
thank you for yet another amazing video.maranatha!!!shalom.
thank you for this update  all best wishes...
i live 9 miles from east palestine. we have well water and i am not comfortable drinking our water  until we have it tested. i tried to buy a gallon of spring water the other day at giant eagle and they couldnt sell it because the water in the gallon may have been contaminated from the train derailment.  we went to sams club and all the water was gone. it is so important that everyone stocks up on water and food.  whatever you need to survive.  trusting in god that we have time to prepare.
hello doc glad to see you  you are correct again
love your videos  my daughter is an rn she sounds allot like you every time i talk to her she would tell me allot on how hospitals treat their patients  it s not like in my day when you had a doctor patient relationship back in the day your family doctor would be the one that would come to the hospital and operate on you unless it takes a special surgeon and they use to make house calls  those days are long gone and over. but to your point there is a reason why the united states are still occupying europe and asia meaning japan since 1945. now the 101st airborne division is now stationed in poland you would think nato in my opinion is obsolete could take care of this mess without the united states getting involved. the european union was created to become one big family but today it seems that it s always the united states that has to clean up their trash. this region has always seen war and will always see war it s mathematical. the european union needs to start cleaning up their own trash without the western nations having to come back in there for the third time and do it for them. it s interesting ever since the end of world war two and even the first world war one the united states seems to be the worlds police. since i retired from interpol i thought we were the worlds police when it was created after the 1st world war it was to make sure dictators would not pull this crap like we see today  then you have the united nations but in reality they are as useless as the current president of the united states  that s why you will never see any blue helmets in ukraine. sooner or later the united states will be in this war no different than how vietnam started  we are seeing a replay of vietnam it all starts with sending arms into a nation to help them out until that nation starts to than ask for more and in the end that nation sends in military and ends up fighting in that country. the germans can no longer back pack across europe anymore and the russians feel boxed in due to expansion of nato  sooner or later the side that feels fenced in their dog will jump the fence  and in this case it s the russians. there is a reason why europe will be in this it s all about land one big land grab nothing changes in this region. keep up the great videos.
amen patriot nurse!  god bless and keep you.
fantastic assessment. cheers!
thank you and well said.
eventually we ll start having the discussion about aging that deals with 1  suggested 2  pressured 3  forced euthanasia for boomers. will we be convinced to take the juice because it s best for our families  will health care be denied because boomers are  useless eaters   will we be morally prepared to do whatever is the right thing  will the churches even be there to help with decisions like this  who could hold out against your own family especially if you are totally dependent on them for everything
this was fantastic  god bless you and thank you
boomer here.. haven t been in this decent shape since my early 20s.  i ve just crossed the hundred pounds less than my highest weight threshold.   started dropping after kicking the medical industrial complex to the curb.  the most frustrating thing is  that much loss on my height isn t even 2 sizes.   grumble  whine  bitch  moan  complain second most frustrating thing. no matter how much i lose  everything is still going to be too short.
i love this woman. no not like a man loves his wife  that s for my wife . but as a fighter on the battlefield  as a cop  as a patriot. her and reid  our side is blessed to have them!
happy birthday patriot nurse!  you re still a spring chicken!  our birthdays are close together.  oh and i told someone about your channel and classes and she s thinking of joining you also.
i am a retired nurse.  i never vaxxed. my daughter is considering nursing but refuses to vax.  would you recommend she keep fighting or go into a new program.
this was good ! thanks much !  i m trying to remind people god has a plan for each of us. it covers everything that is gonna happen.
you re best video ever. my beliefs exactly.
i ve been on keto for the last 2 years and my health is better. i eat no processed foods. i do have a back yard garden and take care of myself. i rarely need any help and i m 70. i am not fully self sufficient i believe about 70
thank you! i plan to attend your tx in person class this yr.
knowledge vs wisdom  spot on!
thanks for the good advice.
our skills are leaving our industries and the newbies don t seem to want to learn from us.
once again  a sincere thank you.
knowledge from books  rather than regurgitated information from the net  might be vastly more important in the near future.
congratulations   that s a huge accomplishment
good for you! is a keto diet going without carbs
@sandrajohnson9926  yes i eat 20 0r less carbs a day.
yep. times are a changing. the storm is happening and if we do what is required  we exit that storm to bright and sunny days ahead. some tough work ahead.
i appreciate your wisdom and passion. ohio chemical spill and fire will effect farming...
your spot on girl.  no disrespect intended.   as a man well into my 60s   i agree with what you re saying 110 .      keep um locked and loaded  and your head on a swivel.   only the good lord in heaven knows what s heading our way.   keep up the good work. and tell it like it is.
we need a bottom up approach vs a top down plan of action because there are more people at the bottom and the most productive would be the ones coming fork nothing and seeing the potential of something greater than they have ever experienced. teach your children to fish farm plant and harvest even on the smallest of scales while you still can
awesome information!
as a boomer  technically a pre boomer    i agree with most of what you are saying.  very interesting.  we must continue to prepare ourselves.  thanks pn.
thank you pn for the video.
always love the blown  kiss goodbye  at the end of your posts!
i am a type one diabetic and if there isn t a cure soon i am doomed!  thanks
scott ritter on youtube is an excellent source of information regarding the russian uke nato war.scott usa marine  was the chief weapons inspector in iraq when usa invaded.his perspective is very important. what he says is more than a report on the blow by blow of the fighting  but is a clever and informed assessment of the politics also.
god bless u for what u do
above all..keep the faith and know that god is in control and will be with those who loves him even in the storm. the storm will come but there is a better country to look forward too for this is not our home  there is  mansion prepared for those who are faithful and true in heaven. come lord jesus.
excellent video pn
very smart insight with a very strong knowledge of history an bible. thank you
thank you pngod bless you and be a blessing
8 00  if you push paper ai can wipe out your job  lawyers  accountants  office  droids  programmers  etc. that is most of the work force. if you have to touch something that will take longer. there s no such thing as a poor plumber or welder in america.
i always look forward to your posts. ty.
scary times! biblical events are unfolding!
you re knowledge of russian history far outways what i ve heard out of our  leaders  in the past few years.
i m a tax accountant and i m starting to see how my job will go away.
for assistance offer s.
as as an atheist social cooperative anarchist  i can not agree with you more about what s to come. i ve watched america crumble to the ground in the last 45 years as a result of blind party allegiance by both teams for the uniparty coalition. i watched as they used bipartisanship to syphen money out of the hands of the people and into the hands of the oligarchs. they ve left our country to rot in decay. if we re going to recover from this we need to come together against them and not each other.
good to see you again patriot nurse
my sister in christ. thanks soooo much for your very informative videos! sorry if i offended you in any way. i intended the opposite. i really do appreciate you! jesus loves you and so do i!
thank you!
john adam s quote is dead on.  we as a society is no longer able to function under the constitution as too many are no moral or virtuous.

you are so correct it is scary ! god bless
ppl are waking up. thank god. most importantly.. don t fear what s coming.. remember our father is in charge. i believe many are trying per usual fear tactics. if you are square and right with our father.. you won t be afraid of what s coming. i think we have been built for this time. so i say let s go.. no fear! you are here in this time for a reason. let s do this.
i appreciate our channel so much. i cling to the word of god too.
i m a christian man  and things are very concerning! i pray every day for jesus christ to return and gather his elect! i definitely do not want to be here for what is coming to this unrepentant and sinful world!  america is in the beginning of gods judgements! matthew 24   luke 21.
things just seem to get worse and worse nothing is getting better. right now life sucks.
may yah bless us and keep us in such a time as this. and yah bless texas.

good morning  patriot nurse!
it may be a good time to revisit  the matrix  trilogy.
amen  i lovingly and bitterly cling to the word of god. that s the only thing that doesn t change.
thank you for your thoughts
as a competent medical herbalist  i am in the position to tell y all that you can never be adequately prepared with your  bandages . i find myself in the position where i either have to resign myself to live in excruciating pain  or rejoin the medical industrial complex. i have no disc left between my bottom 2 cervical vertebrae. i have no choice but to seek surgical mitigation. i writhe and scream in pain  often. i have begged the lord to heal me. to be honest  i am terrified of the possibility of being  jabbed  against my will  while in surgery.
imagine how much we were brain washed while we were young
the american government does not care how many die in order to feed the machine either. viet  afghanistan   and iraq.
you rock patriot nurse!!
since you mentioned one of the founding fathers  john adams  here are 2 statements from another of the founding fathers  thomas jefferson    no free man   shall ever be debarred the use of arms. .   the best that we can hope for  concerning the people at large  is that they be properly armed.   we are.
well said
exactly - i have paid attention in history class and recognize that body counts are a poor way to mark success . both in terms of russian doctrine and then later in vietnam
the last few generations have been strong   the strong make good times.   good times  ...  and here we are .
today s russia is not yesterday s soviet union.  russia isn t taking near the casualties that ukraine is.  it s something like one russian casualty  dead or incapacitated  for every eight nazi ukraine casualties.
thank you so much. i love your prayers. could you include one in your next video
watched this a couple times.  good video.  thepatriotnurse
thank sweet lady stay safe  god bless
shalom pn. i look forward to bible studies with you.
she s right. smart.
what can you use in place for insulin for type 1 diabetic in a shtf situation
you have knowledge and wisdom. you are a true blessing! thank you for all that you do. also you look beautiful today! love the floral blouse
brilliance.   you ve  just   written   preached  and  confirmed me .     again.
just have to make it to 2028 when the cycle restarts and we get 80 more years
your analysis on russian tactics in ukraine is incorrect  in my opinion. but everything else is pretty much spot on  and i agree with your conclusions. sharp as always.
excellent informative video...
you might look into learning more from dr stev ekberg about insulin resistance .
look into bitter melon. i know that type 1 is different than type 2. asians used bitter melon before they had access to insulin. also a combination of chromium and vanadium. cinnamon to level out the sugars. hope i helped.
darlene  us type ones are in trouble. i have found nothing to replace insulin.
research fig leaf.
for those of us that know the word of god  and know that jesus christ is the same yesterday  today  and forever  can go to him in our time of need and he will heal us. but we must know him as lord and savior.
as a musician for 30 years  you will see artificial intelligence writing and producing music in the future. live musicians are becoming a thing of the past as well.
i have an off topic question. what brand of pine needle tea do you recommend  i bought tearelae that comes from china. is there a brand pine needle tea  in a tea bag form  that comes from the usa or other friendly nation.
smart lady. great video. thanks!
everything i know is about to become real....even vogue....i ll feel right at home...  never be blinded by the foot work...or the deception.
yes mam i see it . thank you once again.
start preparing spiritually for rapid trials and tribulations  ..it s here..america is under judgement..pray for god s grace and mercy for the remnant here and all over world.. i am a companion of all those who fear god
thank you   i am retiring psychiatric nurse practitioner  just signed up for a herbal certification course
i fear our awakening is all  too little too late.   prepare to take care of you and yours as best you can!  have faith.  god bless us all.
when you speak of the way demographics are changing in the us it s important to note that both russia and china are facing the same problem. that may be playing into both countries  recent bellicosity  they know that their time is running short because their latest fighting age generation is also their smallest generation ever  just like us.
great seeing you today i hope your health is back on track   you look fantastic today
is the online class different from your live clast
hard to get solid situation reports on russia ukraine war
what you re referring to is the  technological singularity  - the point at which it becomes impossible to predict the future of technological advances because we have no way of even conceiving what they will be - since the changes themselves will be machine ai-derived and happen in the blink of an eye..  ray kurweil and others have written about it extensively.  i think it will probably lead to the end of the human race - probably by 2030.  certainly by 2050.
i live for the blown kiss at the end. it always seems to make me feel good.
but  to be clear  i approve of your message.
i wish you would come to massachusetts and teach a class i would love to learn in person from you
i worked as a painter for google and apple in mountain view california.. i always thought artificial intelligence has been running things for a long time their computer model.. as a painter i had access to classified.. didn t always know exactly what i was seeing but i suspected..
hello all..good morning.
i really don t see any hegemon taking our place. i anticipate more of a collapse on the level of the bronze age. the more physically healthy we are  the better we ll be prepared to handle what is coming.
other platforms have folks with boots on the ground reports.. rumble  odysee etc
giving  top of the line  tanks to zelensky s army should tell you that situation on the ground is desperate
colonel douglas mcgregor is a good one to follow  scott ritter and patrick lancaster
@helenbarber5980  yes the col. is about our only source on this subject
i ll say it has changed!! all of a sudden i am 75!!! and i haven t seen any  good progress  in his world since kennedy was our camelot!! but still breathing and praying!!
i m not so sure we have another 20 years. the speed at which things are moving would suggest otherwise.
thank you. it scares me  but i d rather know than not know. the longer i live  the more heaven appeals to me.  even so  come lord jesus.
ty for what u do.    i would like any feedback on the east palestine  train wreck from a medical perspective.    people are wondering what to expect in the short and long term.    ty
nurse  we are a constitutional republic  not a democracy.
spot on pn!!
they are attempting to rewrite maslow s hierarchy of needs.
agree 100 !
another great video.
keep your faith  hold tightest to that.  pray .a lot!
life was never good for me anyways except with jesus christ alone.
love you girl god bless keep up the good fight
thanks for sharing. and life will change. things wont be the same before covid. things will actually get worse. so the only thing to be prepared for are your fruits and labor with your walk with god. be cautious of the sin of the world. and get saved. god is good.
100 years ago it jobs weren t thought of. everyone is so obsessed with job loss. i think jobs will get easier for us so we don t have to do repetitive jobs anymore. i don t know what jobs will come but it will be great.
don t be afraid   or overwhelmed.  pray !!!!  your needs   and guidance will be taken care of.
thank you!!!!!
the russian way of war you talk about may be true however  we have been  poking that bear so very hard underthe bidon regime for a long time and way too hard...
today  i m a healthy baby boomer. but yes  i realize that my generation is caretaking each other. we are caring for  and burying each other already. i wouldn t trust the medical industrial complex with my loved ones or myself. i m a faith based naturalist. the buzzards can have me! god bless.
good insight and always presented so well thank you pn. also  so pretty today.
would you send me the link for your 4 hr training  please   thank you -patricia
look at recent post from doug and stacey  very informative
glad someone said this to her. i think i ve heard her say it before too. makes me
just an fyi don t think that the ukraine doesn t act the same way in war as russia. i know it does. i remember stories from my grandparents  from the ukraine.and friends who served in the military who since have been over there over the years  have told me that things haven t changed.
in case you didn t know  the company  mood  and youtube are pushing marijuana gummies all over the place like s it s the next comming.  it s on channels that i know kids watch  like homesteading videos.  i m really sick of it.
thank you for having real eyebrows!!
the only thing that can make you ready for what is coming your way is the precious blood of jesus christ  your redeemer  your counselor  your physician and sole provider. those who seek to save their lives will lose them  if your life is in ya  you will keep it forever...for those who have ears to hear. god bless you all  may he have mercy on us all.
sooooo. writers  producers   communicators better re-develop those carpentry  mechanics  building  security and other  skinned knuckles  trades that kept us fed before we got  better jobs  maaaan. i thought i was out of that stuff for good.
you are so on top of it be safe from northern idaho
thank you pnfollowing from adelaide australia are we awake yet

something tells me bureaucrats and middle managers will never lose their jobs to ai
you may have to change your working title to technocratic nurse
i was always taught that the lord left the best spirits for the final day s we re in right now.. i have no doubt we will be alright if we follow the lord.
patterns in human history we are very predictable for people who know history we need to change the obvious patterns we humans seem to gravitate to that s progress
i m praying for russia s righteous cause against the evil globalists.
we can prep and plan all we can  but if we have no faith in the plans of god it doesn t matter. strengthen your communities. division has been the single most effective measure used against us. ask for forgiveness. forgive one another. pray without ceasing.
awesome bless you!
thank you
the reality of this reality is not reality. knowledge is knowing how  wisdom is knowing why.
wow wow wow. everything no one else has talked about. wow sister.
i was noticing that too! i can t stand looking at the trendy inch wide penciled in eyebrows !
@ritaholcombe9905  yesmaam  that shit is so gross to me

i agree we are at the crossroads. however  i think you  as many seem to be  are confused about the nature of the russian mentality. i would suggest you check out the duran  an excellent podcast  by the way  to demystify russia for you. your description of russia is  ahh  malformed...
did reid move to a different platform i don t see his videos anymore   and thank you two for the info you give everyone
we all should move to a state and barter and pick a currency to use   even if that currency is time !
this ai stuff scares me big time!
i just heard mitch mcconnell say yesterday that helping ukraine under any cicumstance is his most important thing
you are correct about wisdom!
a  video!a real mind-bender. i have noticed that people are buying fewer brands at the grocery store  they are focusing more on sticking with certain brands  and are becoming more open to  off-brand  items. the baby boomers have built their own demise. they have profitted by running up the prices on everything then are taking that money and retiring.after they spend all their retirement money on all the high prices they established  they will experience what it is like working entry-level jobs.those entry-level jobs include no seniority  no benefits  wages that aren t enough for living expenses  and no stability whatsoever.
you re friends are truly blessed  hope you re well from
i find myself thanking the good lord for you often ma am. god bless you.

last year i finally got a major medical plan. never got any benefit out of  only out of pocket expense.
pn  well done!!! too many people believe that we are still a  good and virtuous  people in the us. if time permits  tell us the story of how god dealt with recalcitrant peoples in scripture. it s a bit eye opening!!!
you were right   create  it does do that. ai lies and makes up references and fake info.
gracefully stated
your wisdom has not waned one but. we all appreciate your insight. and on a different note  your  as beautiful as ever   making that blouse your wearing look great. very much appreciate every bit of your souls intent.
something went terribly wrong during the baby boomers generation and it just continued to snowball over the decades that followed.
scott ritter  colonel douglas mcgregor and patrick lancaster
he s going over there to fight is he !
baby boomer here. my husband and i both started working at very young ages  many entry level jobs. my husband started picking mint  age 14  1.35 an hour. his dad worked for 2 bits a day and taught my husband to be self sufficient  no allowances ever  zero help with his first  car purchase  etc  and opened his first bank account at the age of 16. he just retired from his illustrious career after 23 years driving an oil tanker  10-14 hours a day  non-union  treacherous weather  and personally witnessed many deadly traffic accidents and other truckers that were killed performing their jobs. and  he never once collected welfare. always  worked hard for everything.
@rhondafster  what you are posting here is just a common work experience today  the difference being that you are trying to make it sound more impressive. you ll understand what things are like when you have no money. it will be a blessing for everyone.
@rhondafster  do you understand how entitled you sound it s embarassing.
@rhondafster  when you are broke  you will know that you deserved no better.it s simply the price you pay for exploiting other people your entire life for your own selfish gain.
@thepatriotnurse.-  please go on.   shalom!
i hope their is a huge change because  there is a huge spontaneous revival going on at ashbury college.
the final cycle of prophecy.

patriot nurse you are amazingly right about your analysis of the world s situation as it is unraveling now. at least i don t feel like i am the only one having those   watching how it all is slowly  unfolding in front of our eyes.  i pray  everyday for the safety and well being of all  family  friends and all sentient beings. having work in nursing for 30   years i have the knowledge and experience to validate and confirm all your statement about the present state of healthcare and what to expect for  the coming future. congratulations you do an awesome job  and are helping a lot of people. please stay strong and of sound mind  and continue to share  may god bless you!!
thanks for the info

you keep a super clean and organized home.
i like you so much. always get my attention.  love your yt channel. b h
whatever you re doing right now is contributing to the history of our world. think about that. that s the case no matter what was going on  but especially now that we are at such a crucial time in the world.no matter what you think about it  we are in some massive repeating astrological cycles that are continuing to build. the old vs. an unknown new   mix that with tons of doses of fear   you have the chaos we see today.what part are you playing  i think we should all be thinking about this. i personally believe each one of us alive during this time period came here to play a part in this. and each one of us has a part. for any of our world history to happen  there had to be different roles   parts.those we idolize in history for the most part are the ones that stepped outside of the box  that rose against those more powerful   spoke truth  those that others could relate with  those that went against the grain even under pressure   fear  those that weren t afraid to be themselves   express themselves  those that stood up  those that helped   served others  those that shook shit up   so on. whether musicians  artists  historical figures etc that made history because they did something different   went against the grain of what was socially acceptable.but there s other roles   parts too that need played. those that have nefarious intentions  those that follow  those that sit   wait or are indecisive  those following orders  those that don t want to be involved  those in power   many many more.either way  right now is a crucial time in the world. we are all creating history   supporting it in some way shape of form.the next several years will keep building towards massive world change. but there are so many openings   opportunities right here right now for us to start doing our part to create the world we want to create.but it starts with you on an individual level. it starts with you making a choice.i know this is quite big picture thinking but i think many of us are ignoring how important right now truly is in the grand scheme of things   how important you are
thank you!
the 4th turning. according to strauss and howe  it should exhaust itself  2030  then the next generational cycle will begin.
i am quite blessed in having been raised by a victorian man and an edwardian woman.  i have a worldview of the past 130 some odd years.  it is wisdom i cherish that was handed down to me  not in words but everyday actions.  the  givens  you stated are not the givens i was raised on.  the only  given  according to my old father was that the lord is your god and we all die someday.
hi patriot nurse. i have a question what happened to the main prepper
hubby and i are 70 yrs young and will fight for our freedom. we grow 1 2 of our food source  using supplements as much as possible but still need some rx. we are yeshua believers and torah observant.  we will never back down. love
your last emphasis regarding decoupling from the ones who are changing us is almost impossible. these people or companies are giving us paychecks. we are screwed.
here s a positive about this calamity of events..there is revival breaking out at ashbury college chapel and other places ...however as one very good preacher use to tell me...revival begins in your own three foot circle...
wise view!
thank you patriot nurse.
i setup some rules in my household   1 love god   2 never underestimate the stupidity of people  3 never trust a fart  4 never trust politicians or media  5 always live off less than you earn.
it s not fair that she doesn t age.
whole lotta truth in this video....
colossus   the forbin project and skynet come to mind...would a sentient machine do worse than we have  there are no sentient computers now  but that might change.     i m one of the last baby boomers....
this side that side i ll stand on with god s side. i will continue to the best of my abilities as a free man or just another casualty. becoming  a pow is not an option. something the enemy needs to think about. and if they don t... well they been told.
is this your reply patriot nurse or someone else scamming. never can be to careful.
agreed
if you want answers about  the future  then i would pay attention to one of the architects of a possible future as stated by   yuval noah harari  . one world gov  one world religion  one world currency.  not what i was hoping for at this point in life.
in the uk  we re seeing the collapse of the nhs  which is all the harder for the population here when they ve lived through many decades of free-at-the-point-of-access  with few exceptions  health care  relatively inexpensive nhs dentistry  which does not  however  cover a  hollywood smile   and more.  we don t seem to have the ability to access medications out-with the nhs that seems relatively easy in the us.  we are unable here to buy weapons and defend our families and property.  our government likes dependency on the system and i d say that the majority of people in receipt of benefits are seeing little reason not to think that s a good thing.  this and other prepper videos from the us are full of fantastic ideas  but we re not able to put many of the suggestions into action here  because they re actually illegal.
on the topic of ai. nobody knows for sure what is going to happen next. it is difficult topic and difficult to predict. but i do think we have reached the pinnacle of ai. it doesn t progress much beyond this. what they are doing right now is abuse ai to control us. and that is it.i was hoping for true ai with all the problems we are facing right now. it could have been a good  tool  and maybe even become sentient. but that is all sci-fi babble. the problem however is that we   humankind   do not want to develop a tool that could save us all. christians don t want it. you have your own savior. and the  elite globalist  do not want it. they just want a  tool  to strengthen and maintain their power. they have no desire for something more intelligent. if we create something more intelligent the elite have to relinquish power. that s not their goal.look at chatgtp for example. it s woke and has no clue. haha. ai had some serious potential  but we do not want it. and that s it.on the topic of what happens next on the  regime change of russia . i m an outsider and atheist and in my country they re going to call for a draft. yep  it is happening. this might lead to a nuclear war. we re basically in ww3 already. it is early stages. and it is the west  or the us of a this time that is the evil one. yes  its you  guys! look at what you did to our nord stream pipeline. we re your allies!it s over bois. tc. s might htf soon. i don t see away around it at this point anyway. tc my republican christian brothers. i owe you my freedoms but it seems we re hitting the train stopper and we re crashing right through it.
i ve said it before i ll say it again. from rome   which at that time was the only true democracy with liberty for about two hundred years.   came serfdom because people was happy with just getting by  and letting some one else do the heavy lifting.
amen sister.
i think it s time for states succession and forming a constitutional republic of the new america. i believe that we have about twenty five to twenty six states that could succeed from the un united states. reason for this action is because of socialism communism and tyranny. can t get any worse than this. thank you from ex army veteran.
for ai  the scales have been stated like this  chimps are a 1 on the intelligence scale  humans 2  and ai  top tier  is 1000.you can t outsmart it  nor outwit it. it is a more existential threat ever faced.

lindsey graham  i like the structural path we re on here. as long as we help ukraine with the weapons they need   economic support  they will fight til the last person .the demonic realm
i enjoyed your presentation  and it is generally accurate  except for your comment on russian military tactics.  even during wwii  the soviet union was not careless with the lives of its soldiers  and its casualty rate was comparable to the german invaders.  currently  in the ukraine conflict  it is the ukrainians who are profligate with the lives of its soldiers.  based on available data  for every eight ukrainian casualties  there is one russian casualty.  another point i would mention is that russia is no longer a communist nation  but has a vibrant private capitalist sector that has funded the rise of a wealthy oligarchy.  one more thing i would mention is that russia was provoked by the united states and nato who continually threatened russia s borders and national security until it was forced to respond.  putin repeatedly tried to avoid this conflict  but found it impossible to do so  and preserve his nation s security.
i am an american in ecuador. what training can i take from you

i don t believe that russia doesn t  care that they are losing people .  they want the best for their people just as we  our gov t  used to.
bbc did an analysis of obituaries in russia and only had an increase of 20k in the last year. ukraine deaths they estimated between 300 and 500k
the patriot nurse gives out excellent information for preparing  etc. but her views on ukraine and russia seem to be missing important details necessary to comprehend the sad situation. prior to the  recent events  ukraine s nazi s had been bombing and murdering their own ukrainian people in donbas for 8 years.  most people are unaware of this important point because the ms media suppresses this info.  i wish the best for people in both countries  and in the u.s.

isn t a coincidence that this is happening as pluto enters aquarius. and as uranus enters gemini america will find itself in war just as it did when japan attacked pearl harbor  which also happened when uranus entered gemini. you cannot deny the inevitable. you cannot deny what you are seeing.

my comment disappeared. patriot nurse has been at the forefront for many many years. we must stay vigilant!
i find the comments people leave interesting.  so many refer to jesus while we both know you are jewish.  i am not into religion to speak of.  but i did like your presentation today.  yes to everything.  my opinion as an old 75 year old white man is that each generation revolves into a new mindset.  out with the old and in with the new concept.  as my generation dies off  the new generation s  will become the old generation.  and they will have to deal with the topics you brought up today. ai is here to stay because the internet permits global colaboration not possible 25 years ago.  just look at elon s internet network over the ukraine and its exploitation for war efforts.  as the polar caps melt  the global temperatures will rise because the oceans will warm more and more.  eventually our asphalt roads will become soup in the summer heat.  people will literally invade canada for its climate.  same for siberia.  and  finally  i think you are not realistic in thinking people can be self sustaining.  i have six months water and foods vacuum packed in the house.  and i refresh everything every six months.  yet  that is time limited too.  i have no idea what people with just a kitchen pantry are going to do.  do you
been watching patriot nurse for several years- always thought she had pretty good content. not so much in this vid  where she pretty much exposes herself as a zionest.
healthcare in tijuana mexico is like it was in the us fifty years ago.
so  the massive consumerism that produces massive waste and pollution  its  diminishing is a bad thing  i will mention the saying  the way we ve always done things is the quickest way to its  death  - is something we need to reexamine. religion is giving way to spirituality because the clique is following outdated ideals. mindfulness  which i do not fully support either  but close to 100   is a forward thinking ideal  which is what we need to embody each and every day we go out our doors from this day forward. examine  absorb  ruminate and embody - the very wisdom you yourself say is needed. one can be moral without religion  one of the tenets so oft overlooked by those selling blinders.
love and thanks.
every empire that has ever existed had a beginning and an end.  wishing that weren t true as it applies to your own present reality is a waste of time.  there s nothing wrong with supporting the values you were born into but assuming they will always be prevalent is naive at best.  the best we can do is pass off as much of our values to those that follow and pray.
the demographics in china are also aging and i believe because of this they will make their military moves now while they have the advantage in numbers of capable military aged men...

that s why i live out in the middle of nowhere have my own cattle pigs chickens and bunnies  grow my own food and harvest my own animals. why i know how to stich up a wound to setting a bone why i know how to fish and hunt. it won t be the country folks that suffer to much it will be the city people who would know which end of a tatter to plant if someone showed then 100 times. oh by the way i would suggest that anyone that wants to keep their stuff buy lots of ammot even if you live way out here along with black powder and pellets for your shotguns. after the city folks get done eating each other if you live within 400 miles of one they will be coming for you! be ready!
i love your attitude you are a beautiful person inside and out
how many russians died in the siege of leningrad...killed by nazis  the death toll of the siege varies anywhere from 600 000 to 2 000 000 deaths. after the war  the soviet government reported about 670 000 registered deaths from 1941 to january 1944  explained as resulting mostly from starvation  stress and exposure.
yea  ukraine has been sacrificing large numbers of troops.  that s just like what russia used to do.

i know  a lot about natural and alternative medicine but what can i use to being down inflammation like prednisone  i had to use that to fix an excruciating sore throat and the doc wouldn t give me anything for pain  just prednisone. thank the lord it helped but i was tortured for 2 days waiting.  i tried so much to fix it before going to the doc but nothing helped. maybe i missed something  i am allergic to alcohol so i couldn t use that in my medicine like a tincture or a toddy.

agreed. i too have read about china s situation and those sources make the same argument that if they are gonna do something  they need to do it soon - while they still can.

i can t believe the push towards riches and securing that.  it s all a distraction.  there are many going on.  keep your eyes on the sky for jesus!  he s our way out of this hellscape.
hello my beautiful and wise nursing friend  love you  missed you  hope all is well with you. glad your back don t stay away so long... thanks for your wise intel muah.
a few points to make.  something i noticed is that in describing the russia ukraine war  you make a lot of comments denigrating russia but do not do the same of ukraine.  while i m no big fan of the russian government  the government of ukraine is far worse  and from 2014 up until this war began  the us listed the ukrainian government as one of the most corrupt on earth.  which leads me to my next point.  you have to be able to separate governments from their people.  russia s people are not bad - it s their government.  same for ukraine.  the people of ukraine did not deserve to have a war raging in their back yard  but their government is the reason that is happening.  despite being neo-nazis  the ukrainian government wants to be part of nato  and nato has not allowed this because of who they are.  the only reason nato is backing the ukrainian military now is because the us wants to get rid of russia as a world power.  it is not because of how upstanding the ukrainian government is.  it is for purely selfish reasons.ukraine  more specifically its government  will not be victorious.  russia will not allow that.  russia does not want us nato missiles in its back yard any more than the us wanted russian missiles in its back yard during the cuban missile crisis.  and for the same reason.  russia having us missiles in its back yard is a threat to the very existence of russia  and russia will use nukes to protect its existence  just as the us would have done back in the 60s.  you mentioned  aggressive shifts in power .  yes  there absolutely will be  even if nukes are never used.  for decades  the us has been using the military and invading other countries to prop up the value of a dying  petro dollar  and few powers in the world are better equipped economically than russia to put a stop to what the us is doing.  since the economic sanctions began  the russian economy has started to boom while the us economy is going downhill.  as much as i don t want a recession or depression here in the us  this has been inevitably building since at least the 30s  if not longer.  the arrogance of empires will eventually be their downfall.as far as religion  which you mentioned  i think we could do with a whole lot less religion because religion has been the cause of countless wars  innumerable deaths  and blind obedience to government authority.  you don t need religion to be a decent person  and i would suggest that if someone needs religion to be  virtuous   then they are a pile of crap to begin with.  as an atheist  i can guarantee i have higher standards of morals than the majority of christians do.  i would also point out that the us is not a  christian nation  and never has been.  in fact  most of the founders were not christians  but deists.  i only know of one professed christian of the founders  and that was patrick henry.as far as preparedness goes  the theme of this this channel  i wholly agree.  nothing takes power from the state like a prepared and self-sufficient populous.  that is my approach to preparedness - to depower the state and government to the point of being irrelevant and eventually non-existent.
i love your expertise and watch you as a result  but your analysis of the ukrainian war concerning the tactics of the russians is incorrect.  the human wave attack is a desperate tactic the russians and soviets used in wwi and wwii.  russia has changed except they still like to utilize overwhelming superiority when attacking.  if you want to know what an honest analysis of the uke war   just go to gonzalo lira.  he lives in karkov karkyv  ukraine.  he is an interesting man with roundtable discussions concerning this conflict.
recapping it  is the baby-boomers fault  anything and everything negative concurrently happening and will happen is our fault  oh woe to the west should we grovel for repentance for our existence    thank you for all you do
your rhetoric is quite illogical to say the least. you understand that ukraine being successful in this war is beneficial to the role that the collective  western and democratic countries  with us in particular  play in the world  however  you also make this side comment regarding  taxpayer  funded defense systems and ammunition being sent to ukraine.  so if the united states  and i am not even talking about this particular administration  but the country as a whole  understands that ukraine being successful in this war is not only vital to the united states to maintain its status in the global geo-political sphere  but to also ensure some sort of stability in europe  some of us s biggest allies   why then complain about investing money into saving the us and the western countries   it is incredibly strange that you mention the united states  contribution in terms of military equipment  etc.  yet you fail to mention that the us is by far not the only country making those contributions.  great britain  czech republic  slovakia  finland  sweden  france  germany  japan  etc. all are helping ukraine because the world hangs in balance between the spread of dictatorship type of governments vs. democratic oriented governments  just like in ww2- russia being in cahoots with n@zi germany at the start of the war  and switching sides later on.  additionally  you don t find it alarming that russia is collaborating with extreme regimes such as iran in this war   i really don t understand the complaining about the us donating military equipment when we could loose so much more if putin wins.  this is a small price to pay  considering it s just equipment and zero american boots on the ground.  we left close to what ukraine has gotten from us in afghanistan  not to mention the many american lives lost.  second you also forget that the united states signed the budapest memorandum.  in it  the us guaranteed the territorial integrity of ukraine if ukraine gave up one the largest nuclear weapons in the world  which it did.  besides meeting the terms of a legal contract by supporting ukraine  do you think any other country will ever give up its nukes or be tempted to fully believe any contract signed between them and the united states   if us would do nothing  besides extremely unfavorable and negative geo-political outcomes for nato and the us  what do you think would happen to the us s negotiating ability abroad and last but not least  if the us and nato countries didn t get involved  ukraine wouldn t be the last grab by russia.  then would come moldova  georgia  and many other post soviet countries.  this is not a secret and russia made its intentions quite clear to rebuild the soviet union.  please remind me--how much did the us invest in the cold war over 70 years adjusted for inflation   was it more or less than preventing a repeat of history in   terms maybe geo-politics is not exactly your forte  and you should refrain on commenting on  as it just comes off incredibly ignorant.
yep  you said it!
you re certainly earnest and  i m sure  a very nice lady.  so  i would like to offer a brief critique.  the presentation comes off as a bit officious. i suggest you tamp-down on the frequent and unnecessary pronunciation of the article  the  as  thee   a classic huckster tell.  and limit your use of unnecessary polysyllabic terms - utilize   beneficent   preexistent to our birth    it actually comes across as condescension.  delete  air quotes  and avoid cliches like  ...in no way  shape or form   etc.  what are your sources   your unquestionable assuredness makes your pronouncements sound almost dogmatic  as though you re naively unaware of all variables in play.  professional subject-matter experts aren t as confident as you.  and the knowledge-vs-wisdom cliche is neither profound nor compelling  it s just semantics  so i d strike that one  too.  finally  your video would be half as long and twice as effective if you didn t bang-on about all things obvious  remember  you re not kamala harris and we re not 3rd-graders.  otherwise  thank you for your efforts and i will look forward to your future videos.
good morning patriot nurse.

that s what happens when you get older. you will get to experience that too  someday. you are wrong though  baby boomers still plow their neighbor s snow  bake and sell pies to keep the city center open. have sales to provide playgrounds for children. provide meals for those in need on holidays. in our town they make food runs and pharmacy runs for those who can t drive in the winter.

daniel s 70th week is fast approaching  harpodzo! my brothers and sisters
im a 74 year old boomer  i was drafted right out of hs at 18 to go fight two wars vietnam and the cold war. i was inspired by jfk who said  ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country  we didnt have instant news with cell phones and email. when at sea we got no news from home. no playing video games on war ships. its a different world.  when the old ww2 vets started dying off  our parents  morals changed.  a lot of draft dodging liberals like bernie sanders and brandon started taking up space  in dc. but you are completely right the boomers are on thier way out   a broken  torch is being handed to a new generation of woke wimps who could care less about a country that was once great and is now in a slow death spirial to socialism. whos going to stand in the gap  whos willing to sacrifice and fight for freedom  we are under attack by our own government and in the process of entering ww3 with two powerful nuke countries. sad so much has been lost in the past two years that so many fought and died for but this slow decay i believe really started happening after the jfk murder   cover up. the one great hope i see right now is a revival taking place as i write in a kentucky university and spreading. untill people repent and invite god back in our country its only going to get worse. we need gods wisdom not anymore ia tech. but first we need a rudder of common sense on this broken ship

the entire  pure blood bible .
channels like yours only give you 3 seconds to flip your phone over to thumbs up and or comment . ordinary channels they give an 8 or 9 second countdown . wonder why

there is a way to slow the video down so you can understand perfectly. ask how in your browser and articles will show up with step by step instructions.
i was born in 55 i m last of the baby boomers and i m scared
worthless jobs will be gone but good luck getting ai to crawl underneath a 100 year old house trying to find a water leak or electrical short whilst navigating around snakes skunks and feral cats.
20 families join force   buy 40 to 80 acres of land    work together to cover all the bases as a tribe  platoon  clan  boy scout troop preper camp. the investments properly recorded   necessity will be the mother for their invention. seek   ye shall find. make the elderly your watch dogs.   mentors.

i m the last of the baby boom generation. now on social security pension. one thing i want everyone to know is once you pass 57 years of age all those corporations you all think are such a benefit. will start showing you the door. you will be pushed out for any reason. you are at the top of the wage scale and younger people will do similar work for less. think higher profit margins. yes there are anti age discrimination laws. now prove it in a courtroom. so it s not because those baby boomer want to retire. you are pushed out. why does the government boobs do anything about it  it s the big corporations that fund election campaigns. do the math. and future generations of workers don t have a chance. i feel sorry for those alive 50  years from now. i ll be six feet under by then.
hi looks like you re feeling better you look so pretty today
all city s will fall the government will also fall it won t be long. it will be like in the day where people rode around in horse n wagon.
israel of old always had to go to the bottom of  the pit  before they looked up and repented.then would god bless them until the next time.
the ukraine says  money for nothing and war for free.
this country will not last 20 years maybe not even 5
i don t like zelensky or ukraine. i don t know that i m even on their side. i don t want them getting another cent from the us. we should not be involved in this. this is between russia and ukraine. we needed to mind our damn business and worry about and repair our country.
all  all  from alberta canada.
look up michael yon.  he says famine is  100 going to happen next year
kurt vonnegut - piano player.....
you are trying to predict too far in the future.  i feel the next 12 months are going to be catastrophic. but remember  the lord jesus said   these things i have spoken to you  that in me you may have peace. in the world you will have tribulation  but be of good cheer  i have overcome the world.  though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death  we will fear no evil  for he is with us.praise god  he will never leave us or forsake us. be of good courage!! god bless

u.s doesn t always win  e.g.  vietnam 1975   politicians are liars  pick one   pure democracy is worse than a republic. oh  u. s grant didn t worry about losses either. we are divided because we divided god s land.
well i listen to your production twice most excellent thank you this is in the 2 a.m. of sabbath morning a beautiful day we have i like the very last of your show best a lot to do with just smile and joy displayed and shared please consider what the scripture says about such as how god showed time he counted the day sundown to sundown it s the basic of basic and we have to start in the right place rather than trying to get to the right place after we start but actually real no matter god s got us and that s real may the good lord take a liking to you
we just need to send the patriot nurse there and all of her followers that s including me and we go fight and take down russia but we go to russia to fight not ukraine cuz it needs to hurt in their own backyard for them to realize what s going on that s just my opinion
its all in sacred scripture..............

you are not telling the truth about russia  ukraine is losing ten soldiers to one russian soldier.
i like the nurse   but she is so naive with russia ukraine conflict
algorithm
a don t give a damn about ukraine war is none of our business
nothing new here  just some fearmongering.
post-ww2 west  no. the sentiments of this video are exclusively from a post-ww2 american pov. the usa is an amazing country but it is not the greatest democracy in the world  far from it  and certainly doesn t speak for the rest of the west.

@dathip  yes
@leighklingler2195  not a good idea! it isn t as bad as you think. hold on tight  you can do it.
@alicerafferty9595  i m trying.. thank you for the comfort
@leighklingler2195  please don t this bring you so much that you want to end your life. i don t know if you pray  god does answer prayers. give it a try! leah  the bible tells the many ways god saved his people. trust in him. take care!
@alicerafferty9595  yes i talk to god every day he does listen to me thanks a bunch  yes i ll continue talking to him
@leighklingler2195  he will take you when it is your time to go. just think of how many lives you can change. the little blessings we give each other during each day go a long way. a smile  saying hi  letting someone go before you in line. the gift of kindness and understanding are very important in these times. the world needs encouraging people.
@alicerafferty9595  agreed
@leighklingler2195  glad we agree!
