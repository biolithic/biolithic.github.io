thank you for being comfortable enough with your faith to share it publicly. refreshing!

this girl is one of the most based people Ive seen. constantly referring to the Bible for guidance and supporting statements and opinions. great job melonie  and thanks for being a role model.

a gaming content creator throwing in biblical references. thats rare   appreciated. God bless  miss mac.

I've watched a lot of your content as it pops up on my feed. you make your videos feel like a discussion among friends having coffee. and that is a welcome breath of fresh air in a society that judges first then talks down to after. you are a light in the darkness! keep it up! also...I completely agree with you on this video!

love that you fuse your faith into each vid  its refreshing for sure. keep up the great content.

keep preaching. never seen a video with such truth and humor on top of it. never fail to entertain.. keep doing you my dude.

originally here from the quartering s channel. I actually recently returned to the faith after being reached out by an evangelical church. I really appreciate the Bible verses  and I think they will help me develop my own relationship with God.

yo...... as if I didn t already love ya  so refreshing to see someone speak about their faith with conviction. I came here because of jeremy  I am coming back every day because of you.

I am not one bit religious but I really appreciate those references. Imay not be religious but the Bible is a very important part of my culture and seeing it referenced fills my heart with pride.  God would probably not like that but what can I do...

the same is also true for women. God made us equal and discerning. thank you for your demonstration of faith and common sense.

Christian army brat here - thanks for this. keep doing you woman.

its refreshing to see someone so bold about their faith.
