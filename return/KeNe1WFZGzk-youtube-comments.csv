I am not religious myself in the sense of organised religion  but do like to hear your takes on the Bible and certainly do not object to them. over the past few weeks I have recommended your channels to others and most have since subbed. good luck going forward and keep up the good work!

Im so glad you shared that verse!  my dad always made sure we knew this  and all the other Bible verses warning against behaving like pharisees  the ancient wokies .  its so great that there is somebody  other than my dad!  who is speaking about this!  go  melonie!

Im not a religious person in the slightest but that Bible verse is gold.I was thinking about the social media pandering as well.

love your vids  and cant wait to see you on fnt. really love that youread the Bible at the end of your vids.

being someone who isn t religious by any stretch of the imagination  I really  really like the Bible segments. keep doing exactly what youre doing. its greatly appreciated.

Im not much of a religious person but that Bible verse was on point.

also  side note. I am definitely not a Christian. but I yet watch every vid to the end. you hit home so hard every time.
