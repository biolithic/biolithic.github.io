I like your video s and the Bible talk at the end. no shame in loving Christ. confess him before men he says he will confess you to his father. the just shall live by faith is my go to. stay boomin

fantastic video melonie! its good to see someone who is openly Christian. I was honestly surprised that you fid a Bible quote at the end of some of your videos and I find it refreshing. I found you through fnt and now think youre one of my new favorites. the thing you said at the end also about being honest no matter what is so true I use to be one of those people who lied because I wanted people to think I was cool or had a better life but I eventually grew up and realized honesty is truly the best policy even when it might hurt someone in the short term its better in the long term.

hey melonie  recent subscriber here!  caught you on friday night tights!  to my surprise  youre not only beautiful but a gamer with values Christian !  also  youre a carnivore!  Ive been on keto carnivore for 2 years now and its the best thing Ive done for my life!  it looks like youre are also thriving on being carnivore  thought you were in your early 20s  you look great for your age  this is what carnivore does!  if only the majority of ppl could know the real truth!  doctors have been lying for decades  they want you sickly to get those expensive pills   appointments!  anyways  Im enjoying your content!  keep it up!

holy moly! randomly come here after watching a drinker video and then I got a Bible study! thank you! really .. thank you! also a point on talking about old gamers. Im a pretty  og  gamer I think ... considering my first games were played on the tsr 80 loaded with a .. ahem cassette and mostly text  zork  or awesome graphics with asciI characters. I remember over the decades having to hide my hobbies. reading fantasy and science fiction  watching anime from all the nasty  cool  people bullies out there. when you were talking about that it kinda struck me that all that has happened is that thode original bullies have merely appropriated our hobby.

its refreshing to see content creator adding Bible verses towards the end. nice video and God bless you.

that was a unique transition  from talking about the fiction and character dispositions  then to the Bible verse. but  this is somewhat at the heart of the issues.

Im crushing on you so bad  haha. its great that I found you right as I was getting back into the church. makes me feel better about the choice. God bless.

I used to be one of those people who were primarily self interested  would lie  cheat  steal to get ahead  etc.even through all those years  the holy spirit was there in the back of my head gently reminding me that what I was doing and how I was living my life was wrong. even after 3 years in state prison  I continued to live selfishly for a long time  ignoring what I was hearing in church  in Christian music like skillet and demon hunter  etc.eventually  though  those seeds began to sprout and I have spent the last few years trying to live a more Godly life. its not easy  but I feel more fulfilled and more at peace now than I did before.
