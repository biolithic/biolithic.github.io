never had any interest in the show  tbh. but i have to say again how much i appreciate you sharing your faith in your videos when the you feel moved. it s because of you that i got my faith back. read my bible all the way through last year and working on it again this year.

thank you for your candor  its still amazes me when you talk so freely   unabashedly about your faith especially in this climate of  cancel woke culture   . the bit about reading the bible - i took it person . god bless you

god bless melonie. i agreed with all you said.

as a pastor i love your videos. maybe we ll get a chance to chat about the faith someday

i read the bible start to finish in 2021. it really does change your life and perspective. i need to get back into it lol! but it definitely made me confident in the lord and in my faith. i m better able to stand up and defend for what i believe is biblically sound.

think i ll check out your discord. thank you for all you do. more i watch you the more i feel inspired to go deeper with my faith in christ. sometimes it s hard to watch you because it s so convicting  but that s part of the reason ni know what you re saying is legit lol .

i m not religious and even i can see why we probably should be living by jesus christ and the bible. there s more evidence for it than against it. i m starting to not even see it as a religion  but rather a way of life and i feel myself growing closer and closer to god by the day whenever i see these crazy stories...

clicks on this bc i like you and the last of us and wanted to see your opinion this video  causes me to clean my entire room and read my bible you  genuinely  rock

i find the bible lectures relaxing to listen to

dude i ve been so depressed and anxious the only thing that takes my mind off things is reading the bible.  it shows that all the crap we have been going through is nothing new but that christ god is always there for us and things work out for those who stay on the path.  cheers and god bless.

i just discovered your channel! definitely agree on reading your bible more can change your mood and let alone out look on life

hey melonie  just wanted to say as another follower of jesus who also loves to be a nerd  i really appreciate you standing up for god s word and not having to completely give up the things you enjoy to do so. your takes on these world views are so refreshing and it brings joy to me. awesome videos and i pray god continues to bless your channel as you keep glorifying his name! lets go!

there are vices in this world that are extremely hard to give up. at 32yrs old  probably why i am not a father. i have my own vices and personal struggles to get through. my personal walk with jesus is a walk in progress. but i know i am on the right side of things.
