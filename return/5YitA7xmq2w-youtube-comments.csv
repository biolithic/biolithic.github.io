I know you ve mentioned you feel that your god-focused content doesn t score the same number of views as your entertainment-focused vids  but think about this  what kind of comments do you often receive the most more often than not  you get all sorts of comments from people thanking you for the help you ve given them. for the impact you've left on their lives. you see all sorts of people thanking you for being a bold witness for god! that's because the work you do for god has eternal worth and value. 

i truly appreciate it and now will avoid  this  like the plague. god bless you

regardless of what the views are  what ultimately matters is that you are positively impacting people's lives by standing boldly for jesus
