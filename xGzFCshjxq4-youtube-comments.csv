i m throwing in my vote for a live action remake of  the fox and the hound   starring a cat and a rabbit.
the actress is hawaiian descent. yet all these critics and activists are now saying how she s  not dark enough  which shows you who the real racists are.let that sink inalso seeing a obama movie with ryan gosling as obama is something i would definitely see!
hawaiian native speaking here. most people don t know this  but there are barely any full blooded hawaiians alive anymore due to thousands of hawaiians that died after being exposed to european diseases several hundred years ago. most people with hawaiian blood are less than half hawaiian nowadays. although many hawaiians have dark skin  there are also many light skinned hawaiians as well. i have had many issues with disney s propaganda and casting choice s recently  but i personally don t see anything wrong with this actress
saying black dwarfs is a new thing isn t true kevin heart has been around for years
oh this is absolutely hilarious  i had a co-worker who recently found out i was from hawaii  part native hawaiian too  show me this during our shift last night  she was confused why i wasn t angry over this news. i just looked at her and said  so who did disney cast as ariel again   and man the look on her face when i said that  it s like she knew she couldn t say anything lol.
they re all coping so hard saying that  ariel is a fictional character  like nani isn t   or anne boleyn is    this is gloriously entertaining
what happened to  every little girl deserves a chance to see herself as the character
disney has become the poster child for giving us what we don t need or ever asked for to begin with.
i hope people realize the majority of dark-skinned people genuinely do not care  we just wanna see good stuff. i m a black man  and i hate when they make non-black characters black. it s terrible no matter what race-swap is done  idk why they can t just make characters look true to their original portryal. all it does is ruin beloved series and create seperation because a loud small group of ppl try to speak on behalf of a whole demographic who...hint hint  don t care. like melonie said  just give us who fits the role best
white bad. color good. rainbow even better!  lol! what a disaster this world is coming to. keep spreading good stuff!
my take on this is that disney shouldn t bother with the live action remakes and instead make new movies that people actually want to see
they better cast a real alien to play stich.
ariel  she was choosed by her voice man.tinkerbell  color doesn t matter for fairies man.heimdall  it s marvel mithology man.velma  there are other problems than color man...now .... the color maaaannn
hook wasn t even a live action remake  it was a live action sequel. it did the  subvert expectations  thing perfectly. peter pan is about a boy who doesn t want to grow up. hook is about a man who forgot what it s like to be a boy.
sydney is born and raised in hawaii. she has hawaiian ancestry. she even looks like the character. native hawaiians are actually very diverse. all she needs to do is get a tan and she is good to go.
i identify with the actress because i m also an actress with a similar issue. i am 100  puerto rican  but puerto ricans also look very different. sometimes i look somewhat hispanic to some people and oftentimes i look  too white.  my mom has a worse problem. she and her parents were all born in puerto rico  but she happens to have blonde hair and blue eyes. it s not the typical hispanic look but it s hilarious to see people surprised when she speaks native spanish. it s crazy how color is the  perfect  indicator of race
as a person who always prioritized the actor looking like the character  seeing the  it s just fiction  folks losing their crap is hilarious.
why tf do we need a live action for one of the best and most beautiful cartoons there is
i grew up in hawaii and shes as hawaiian looking as pretty much any hawaiian polynesian girl ive known. people complaining are just showing their racist souls expecting everyone to be as dark as an effing cartoon character. you know being in the sun all the time to get so dark isnt good for your skin  right  the hell
i hope she was casted based on how well she played the part in the auditions.
how about a seal and a penguin  get some of that antarctic representation in.
a hedgehog and a seagull.
a squirrel and a chipmunk

i was thinking more an elephant and a hippo...
oh lord  don t give them any ideas lol
no no you need an odd couple cat and a rat. maybe make the cat grey and the rat a brown mouse who has access to dynamite and hammers.
jeez...at this point  it s a venus fly trap and a gender-confused mosquito
a rasta rabbit with dreads
@robint h-d.e.s  i can dig it  mon
you can tell she s a pacific islander too just from looking at her facial features. white skin doesn t make you huwite. just like how indians from india aren t suddenly black just because some of them have black skin.
they would rather have a black actress play her than this woman which was half hawaiian
@max master j  throw their own logic back in their face  best person for the job skin color is irrelevant right
@victor von doom  might as well  but i lost interest in the live action remakes after beauty and beast. that being said  i m pretty sure little mermaid will tank in week 2  snow-white will do worse  hercules will flat out flop  lilo and stitch will be mistaken for guardians of the galaxy 4  and moana . . . already has people scratching their heads as to why  given the film isn t even 10 years old .
@max master j  bro you clearly never been to india
but you guys would be upset if the rabbit was black. were not talking different animals remember. your talking on the context of skin color.  so do you think their are black dogs and foxes
@robint h-d.e.s  yup were racist go to be seen
i dare disney to do a live action zootopia.
pig and elephant. prove once and for if the dna just won t splice.
moose and squirrel  they worked for the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle.
and keep the name the same!
well  they did remake a movie called the karate kid and made it about kung fu.
@ric  and if its gona be realistic dont forget seal graping pengiuns dead corpse
@samurai nelson  so you think race only applies to skin colour  also  yes there are black dogs and foxes.
lol
voiced by black actors
i watched avatar and it is a racist movies. they had humans playing blue aliens. aliens should play aliens
you delusional   you re comparing two different species with humans who are same species
how about a rock and a tree
i say they make a movie called the last black man on earth starring tom hanks
didn t basically the same happen with rami malek a long time ago
reminds me of the trump  where s his birth certificate   fiasco on obama  because obama was born in hawaii but of course that s not american enough for right wingers.and even providing that certificate wasn t enough for some of  them. so left and right wing can be equally stupid in their own right.
they don t care. the racism and hypocrisy criticism only cuts one way by design.
@snapdragon 9600  not really. he never provided the original and took a suspiciously long time to provide the copy that he did.
clown world  welcome to the future.
she just needs a tan and dark hair  and she ll match the character well enough.
@nathan cook  exactly
no no no. it was the same ppl who were crying about ariel
everything about their beliefs is entirely surface level
there s a kitchen sink knocking at your door ... let that sink in!
@victor von doom  yes  i agree
good point  why did disney make that character so dark skinned in the first place.  just remember before the last decade disney was pushing an entirely different agenda.
@snapdragon 9600 of course people who blindly follow and obey wealthy and power hungry politicans.  surpised how long it taking everyone else to realize that none of them care about us  we are just useful to them.
yes ryan gosling as obama is dope never saw someone more perfect for the rol despite not being black  so funny shit.
they re calling it  colorism  lmfao. these jokers love to label everything.
she s not hawaiian though  she s asian and white. she was born in hawaii  there s a difference from being indigenous hawaiian and being born in hawaii.
and the thing is  they are talking about her eyes and nose  saying how it s  clearly  a more native hawaiian..buttt if you look at the  white  characters in lilo and stitch.. they look just like nani. the life guard  the ice cream tourist.. they also have the far set eyes and plum nose  it s literally just the style of lilo and stitch..
@bivy b  nailed it.
but it was always because of the color of the skin for them  why are you surprised  i m asian  japanese brazilian and yellow skin  if i was vietnamese i would be  allowed  in their club.  but i m japanese so i m not...  hollyweird tries to make  jlm  happen but it never works lmao
@kuggacourage gx  actually it s a mix. alot of the people praising the miscasting of ariel are upset over this  after hearing her sing   best actress for the job  is debunked . there are those who hate both casting  but the former is more upset than the latter.
@greenliongirl07  yes and no. one the ppl praising the casting not miscasting  are being hypocritical yes but so are the same ppl who hated and being racist about the ariel thing by making excuses for this.mel isn t a racist but she is being hypocritical as the sjws are.both sides are in the wrong. let these 2 actresses do their job and paly the characters. it isnt that deep  cause yall don t want the smoke i will give yall.yes her singing was fine. there was nothing wrong with her voice .also no  how tf was it debunked th at she didn t got her role no both of yall are hating for no reason
@kuggacourage gx  her singing is mediocre at best  literally no emotion. it s a miscast. you don t have to agree with me  but i know the movie is garbage anyway and would ve been if ariel had gotten someone who looked and sounded like her. i don t expect lilo and stitch to be any better because those cgi aliens are going to be just as creepy as the fish in the little mermaid.
ah yes hawaiian but mostly british-irish   filipino.i could understand half hawaiian and half another polynesian instead of half white n half filipino...
@kurt kala  yet these are the same ppl getting mad over a bloody mermaid with a greek themed father in a magical fairytale about 2 different worlds  races falling in love where the original story was darker and the mermaid fell in love but the prince didn t is being played by a black woman with red hair
i watch avatar and it was pretty racist. humans should never play blue aliens. it s  ofarnsive
i watch both avatar movies and i am offended that humans played blue aliens called the navi. so racist
she s mixed haiwan x white women not a pure haiwain
@max master j  because you sumo india is very diverse with different ethnicity living in one nation. like maybe russia you can find some central asian people in russia lol
@max master j  she is white as well
@jarrod graham  so u are ok with nani
@kuggacourage gx   don t want the smoke i ll give y all  lmfao bro if you want sloppy seconds representation that s cool but the rest of us don t want that crap point blank period it s not racism it s just saying portray the character as they were written in don t want a white blade  asian black panther  or indian thor so no i don t want a black ariel that simple you literally could ve just casted her as tiana she is beautiful and can sing that was the perfect role for her or better yet make a new character this  y all are racist for not liking this miscast  is ridiculous on every level and for the hypocrisy on our part i agree this was also a miscast however i m laughing instead of complaining solely due to the sjws mocking us and calling us names for years only to do the very thing they complained about now
this is the comment i was looking for. not often id consider calling melonie out for making a dumb video but if i ever did...this would be the one...
true that  hawaiians come in all sizes  shapes  and colour pigments. i m 3 quarters samoan  12.5  hawaiian and 12.5  chinese. and i m pretty pale
yeah  figured this was the case since i remember there being light skinned characters in the animated version.
isn t there a island near you used for nuclear testing and no one allowed to go there
there s also that the actor is culturally hawaiian since she was born and grew up there.  with today s global connectivity  people need to figure out that race isn t culture.  ironically  it s many of the most american non-whites that are the most vocal about claiming culture.  my mom is korean  but i don t claim to know her culture because she made the choice not to teach me.  i m racially part-korean  but i m culturally american.
@steve giles  no  but there is a private island where you have to be invited by the family who owns it  niihau.nuke tests were in other parts of pacifica  like bikini atoll.also -- i m predominately tahitian  ancestral island where hawaiians came from  and hawaiians and tahitians do come in many different shades  even two sisters can be very different shades.
it took a few attempts reading this sentence to understand  and by time it worked  the funny was gone. just go on and edit it. i got you.  saying black dwarfs is a new thing isn t true. kevin hart has been around for years.
stoop lol
oh. my. gods.
daaaaaaaamn
ba dum tsh
@josiah stormrage  skill issue
@zerch   clearly  i m not that guy
i can t breathe
bro most  light-skinned  hawaiians are half european which is not a real representation of the people but of an admixture.
@fatboyray24  so that makes them less hawaiien cause their blood is not pure anymore or what is your point
@lucy carlay  no it doesn t make them less hawaiian  however ethnically native hawaiians are nearly erased at this point with everyone marrying out or being priced out of the island. there s nothing wrong with mixed marriages or hapa children  but it s kind of sad to see an entire group of people essentially be replaced with another. however  such is time and the rule of proximity i guess. i suppose it s only inevitable that we all mix and form a shared ethnic identity.
it s not the nani we watched back then  or is it  why do they have to keep changing oc s  often their skin color   it s weird. it s like they aren t happy with what it originally was...
we all know he s a halfling
got heeeeem
hahaha!
lmao
nice!
kevin hart isn t a drawrf he s just short ...he looks like a drawrf next to the rock
gary coleman and emanuel lewis has entered the chat
@mos melendez  dude i m
hey if you played botw than yes there is black elves called the gerudo
love him though
what cha talkin about willis ! - gary coleman
brilliant.
best person for the job  right lol keep throwing that right back at them
@victor von doom  actually after hearing part of your world  i m 100  sure they could ve found someone better.
@greenliongirl07  she s not a very good singer   unlike brett i dislike how she looks.
lol.. true
the same people got mad at gods of egypt played by white actors are now defending cleopatra played by black actress   ancient egyptians weren t black either !
@orange chicken  yep  you are talking about the same people who got angry at an egyptian actor for playing as... you guess it... an egyptian character. rami malek
@orange chicken  ancient egyptians were closely related to the celts.
@steviegoy  yeah we have mummies from early egypt with blonde and red hair as well as hieroglyphs that depict egyptians bring far lighter than their neighbors the nubians and slightly darker than the asians and europeans there were a few black egyptians but not too the extent these ppl claim
i know right  every single cartoon is a fictional character not real.
@steviegoy  some most were  yes just look at the paintings they had very clear to depictions of what skin tones looked like in hieroglyphics explaining it so you are correct. all the women were very light-skinned cuz most of them stayed indoors and the men worked outside getting more tan only reason we know this is because the women wouldn t be a completely different color than the men for years and years and years if they were different race so they were lighter-skinned or olive.
my favorite gaslight of theirs is that ariel is a mermaid and therefore a fantasy creature and not a human  therefore her skin color shouldn t matter... but she spends a huge chunk of her story posing as a human and eventually ends up permanently human  so the fantasy creature defense goes completely out the window.
i don t know but that s a very good question
@jare rare bear  a missing context again  yes she spends all her time as a human... but what cultural aspects are involved with that  care to explain why her being white matters to the story since you know that she should be or are u gonna back track  resort to name calling or simply ignore it because u have no argument that she needs to stay white  all u antiwoke people do is complain about characters being changed who s race never mattered and u never actually have a reasoning as why they should stay white there is characters who s meant to stay white still uk  like merida because her culture was important to the story
if they cared so much about the ethnicity of the character in ariel then why didn t they hired a danish actress... the tales origin is danish..
@leslie thomas  what cultural aspects are involved in a danish fairy-tale  i fathom danish people
@ereis fireboi  it s not a danish fairytale how many times do i have to explain ariel is not the same character as the old story disney was inspired by the story but they aren t the same character how is it easy to recognize that tiana isn t the actual princess and the frog but it s very hard for yall to see that ariel is not the mermaid from the little mermaid nowhere near the same but regardless just because the story was made by a danish person doesn t instantly mean the characters are supposed to be danish  that s like me making my main character black and calling it a black story your gonna need more than a black or white mc to make it a cultural story u need to add aspects of the culture within the story to make that work
@                because the danish story is not the disney story lmfaoooo omg is princess tiana the same character as the princess and the frog  no she was just inspired by it  that s the same as ariel  red hair isn t even known in danish places people over there have blonde hair. disney s lore wanted her to be the daughter of the red sea that s why her hair is red but the red sea is the african oceans so yes her being black regardless makes sense for the disney lore  ariel is the 7th sister of tritons daughters who are supposed to be the daughters of the 7 seas that s why they looked different before and that s why they look even more different now the daughters are representing the oceans their from. this is also why the white sea sister had white hair in the original and the black sea sister had black hair ect.
yea i never understood ariel s race swap  but i also didn t care. but i think people saw aladdin and their white washing and since it was mostly about the characters  culture  then it was brought up with disney always seeming to whitewash poc people.i wouldn t know a mermaids culture maybe they should have made ariel purple skinned  nani still is full hawaiian has hawaiian features  but they decide to cast someone who is mostly british-irish and filipino  and she does seem to have more of those white features. but again as melonie said  as long as the actress can portray her character well it can be fine. still seems like whitewashing for nani s character tho  and as a polynesian with 1 4 hawaiian i was hoping to see someone who had polynesian hawaiian features play nani.
never mind the fact the girl playing nani looks like exactly like nani
@wayward folk  no she doesn t. in any form.
@kurt kala  i m noticing a pattern because this literally isn t the first time disney has done this  when they keep whitewashing poc characters both live action and animation there s clearly something else going on
@orange chicken  there were black people in acneint egypt also coptic . it was diverse back then lol
@leslie thomas  you can say  but it s not ariel  it s not the same character as the old story  all you want  hell call it a spinoff if you want  it s source material is still based off of danish fairy-tale  you can t undo that no matter how you feel about it  you ll be ok
@ereis fireboi  and u can t undo the fact that disney threw out the danish aspects and made her greek so if your okay with disney race swapping her then why are u mad that their race swapping her again and don t try to switch your argument because ur argument is that she needs to be danish lol and dont try anyway and say  well greeks are white  because greeks were considered poc until the 1900s which was a century before ariel was created in general and in the film which means she still would ve been considered a poc in the movie
@ereis fireboi  u say the source material matters yet disney threw out the source material your speaking of lmfao twice  nostalgic fragility at its finest
@leslie thomas  greeks can be considered whatever but they re still light skinned white looking ppl the new movie isn t and i didn t bring up the danish one i brought up the disney one that most ppl know where she s greek so again why does some races matter to you but others can be switched give me one non hypocritical reason
nintendo will kick them offnthe curve.they lost what they do best for a decade now.
a lot of people do care. i personally don t but a lot do
a majority huh
@the merc with the mouth  yeah  are you saying most of them are whiny children
@the merc with the mouth  he s right a majority of us don t care about stupid representation we just want good movies raimi s spidey is a certified hood classic lol not too mention we love anime not alot of anime is black but that s never stopped its prominence in the community
i have a problem with it... she is too light... i have problem with ariel too.... and tinker bell. keep characters close
the weirdest thing i ever learned was how some black people in their own community distinguish people by light vs dark skinned. the healing starts at home folks lol.
@kel p  so you know a majority of black folks
@victor von doom  so you know a majority of black folks huh
@the merc with the mouth  yeah as a matter of i do there s tyrone tyrell tashawn tianna t-dog t-dawg not to be confused for the other one  darrell and minnie moore and they agree with me on this
@victor von doom  that s not more than 20 million but ok bro
@the merc with the mouth  the fact you thought that comment was anything other than a joke is hilarious i mean i literally ended my list with minnie moore lol
i make one exception with making a non-black character black.michael clark duncan as king pin in dare devil was awesome. too bad the rest of the movie wasn t.
@xxlssbbw  we all had one exception we said screw that exception when they stopped making one or 2 race swaps commonplace ana instead started race swapping any and every character they possibly could to the point where it s unrecognizable like april o neil  starfire  jimmy olsen  valkyrie  etc
@victor von doom  nah i got the joke
@the merc with the mouth  that s my question to you you silly person.
since i m shadowbanned i ended up putting your comment lower on the top comment list. also my likes are anti-likes so it went from 148 to 147 after i liked the comment
no joke  when i was a child i adored star wars and wanted to be lando for halloween. i didn t even think about his race  i just thought he was a badass character because he wore a cape and was always there to help rescue his friends. i was so bitter because my parents were afraid of letting me go to school wearing my costume because of how it might look  but they compromised and let me go trick or treating with it on instead. my black neighbor loved it and took a picture of me  which still makes me smile to this day. i can t imagine living in a world where iconic characters are changed to push a rediculous narrative. honestly  it feels disrespectful.
i think it s just a matter of respecting the original source material.no one gives a f about having different ethnicities or races playing lead roles  but when you just swap them for brownie points  it s kind of insulting when you tell people it was just   the best person for the role .all the live action disney remakes suck anyway. they re for airhead and disney adults that are cringe.
that is a popular take. too bad disney does not have a creative bone in its body
that requires creativity  something the empire doesn t have
wait  is marijuana legal in florida yet  if it is  then disney executives should get as much as they need.where do you think some ideas come from. maybe acid.
@dj lizardon  they didn t have such creativity in the first place. all they did is they little changed and animated already written legends or books.
i find it funny that in movies people dont want remakes but begging gaming companies to keep churning remakes of old games. can we get something new for once
@aiveq  that s because those old games were made for old gaming systems that are no longer commercially relevent  in some cases the systems games are either prohibitly expensive or are difficult to emulate.  hence why people want remakes remasters of those games so they re easier access to a newer audience who might not of played them first time around.
@creativewm_personal  mate that bullshit.  i can give you ds and such  controls on emulator are horrible there but snes  sega  ps 1-2  psp  there maybe 3 obscure games i couldnt run and that cuz my cpu is crap to emulate em
@aiveq  emulators may be legal but the roms aren t  also not all games emulate very well and some systems are not very emulator friendly like the ps3.  you re also forgeting that most people can t operate these emulators properly and are turned off by the notion of learning software  whereas with offcial remakes remasters available on consoles and steam people can just plug   play with ease.
@creativewm_personal  who wants to emulate ps3  what there to emulate  most emulators are unzip and play  copy paste bios maybe from folder to folder and set up controls on keyboard gamepad. if you can do smartphone you can do emulator. official remakes are not even same games usually  ff7 remake is like 10x price of original and gives you a disc 1 with different story. re 2 removed scenario b completely. re 3 full of cutting corners. could you put all that effort into making something new  it looks nice  but insides are not what it was. why has to be remake of something  you clearly have ability to make decent games. is writing department so barren  dont fix what isnt broken
i could careless about how nani looks. i m more concerned about stitch tbh. i m getting sonic vibes lol
@88amona  yikes
i wanna see a real giant monster playing gantu.
i hope they follow the original design.cute and terrifying!
they should cast grogu to play stitch and really piss everyone off.
that s blackface! reeee!
@norman readdis
maybe die her hair too
gonna keep it 100  she s close but her tone is off by alot they could ve given her a tan or something but then everyone would lose their minds for another reason lol
here s a little fact for some of you people in these comments hawaiians aren t actually as dark as they show in lilo   stitch because hawaiians are a mixture of europeans in japanese which are asian people and take a guess about something else too my ancestors native americans were also a mixture of europeans and asians so yeah native americans never were as dark as black people like they seem to think neither were people of hawaii the only reason why there is darker hawaiian people is because they also mixed with other cultures too over the years who happened not to be european but technically hawaiians are originally lighter-skinned because there are mixture of japanese and europeans so yeah i hope you people learn from this little fun fact
yeah this is a fair point. makeup  costume  lighting  etc. can make someone look completely different so maybe she ll look more accurate when the movie comes out.
bravo
yes that would be cool. also love that name sydney  i have a younger cousin with that name so automatically like the actor playing the character cuz of my affinity with the name. yes it s arbitrary  but don t care
@dum  dumer  what does that mean  more accurate  there is no  accurate  way to look hawaiian. wtf
@smokejaguar six  no i meant accurate to nani the character. i m not saying she doesn t look hawaiian.
she looks nothing like the character stop trying to  cope  i m glad she is part of the culture at least
@tea time  i disagree  i think their faces are similar. how exactly am i coping  you are the one that sounds triggered by the points that i raised. it actually sounds like you are the one trying to  cope  with a hire that doesnt conform to your way of thinking. get over it.
@smokejaguar six  more accurate to the cartoon character obviously. dude calm down.
@aaron williams  lol i look at faces for a living there is nothing remotely similar about her except their culture. my way of thinking  i just want them to get actors that look like the characters.
@tea time  why does she need to  shes actually hawaiian. im from there. i know. the cartoon is some artists  idea  of what a hawaiian looks like  not what they really look like.
@djbrandywine gaming  wait  what   hawaiians didn t come from japan and europe  they came from tahiti.  i m part tahitian even our languages are similar   l  and  k  in hawaiian is  r  and  t  in tahitian.many of us also have some japanese too  but that came afterwards  not in the beginning.edit  sorry  typo
@tea time  that s true  her face doesn t look like lilo s.
@smokejaguar six  why  because just being hawaiian isn t enough she doesn t resemble nani in the slightest. go look at the actors in the aladdin movie they look like the characters. tiana s voice actor looks just like her and could play her if they did a live-action version. need i say more  it s just not a good casting no resemblance at all.
@zxy atiywariii  what he is saying  i think  is that after captain cook came and missionaries and then sailors and then soldiers  engineers  tourists and settlers came it has become very difficult to find a hawaiian who isnt at least 75  something else which means mostly european japanese chinese with a quarter of polynesian hawaiian mixed up in there. now try to find someone who is atractive who can act and and your pool becomes a teapot. besides  how those white  karen  disney artists drew the character isnt really how hawaiians look anyway. i grew up on oahu. hawaiian women arent that dark at all. ive seen far more haoli locals with darker tans than most hawaiian women. hell  i was one of those haolis with a deep tan and shock blonde hair from being a perpetual beach crab. you know what i mean. people need to chill out about this. she looks fine and shes actually hawaiian. this whole thing is stupid.
so she s a local howlie  it s not like casting emma stone to play a hawaiian with chinese ancestry.
bro she s phillipino and white. born in hawaii. she  looks nothing like the girl.
@tea time  the actors in the aladdin movie looks like the characters  bro no naomi scott doesn t look like jasmine at all  i think her voice is amazing but she s not even middle eastern. at least sydney agudong has some hawaiian blood mix  born and raised in hawaii and actually knows and practices its culture.
@     her mother is indian.... and she did look fine as jasmine and they put effort into her costume as well.also  she s very obviously an indian woman i wouldn t have even had to guess by looking at her.
@nathan cook  dye
@tea time  the character is a stylized cartoon that doesn t share proportions with any actual human being.
i find this hilarious and i m loving it. for years we have been complaining about gender  race  sexuality etc swapping. not because of the skin colour or any identity swapping but the ideologies behind the changes  also the amount of swapping for no reasons. for years we were called every name under the sun. now the shoe is on the other foot it has shown the world how disgusting  racist and stupid these people are. they are shouting and screaming and using the same points we bring up  but we were insulted and bullied for having those points. now we can laugh at them and enjoy them tacking their own medicine. this is disney doing it which is a shock and makes it sweeter. they told us to suck it up  so now its their turn to suck it up.
damn. white and hawaiian is a pretty nice looking combo
as someone who was burned and raised in hawaii  i can confirm that there are light skinned native hawaiians. i went so school with some of them. they may have light skin  but they are hawaiian by blood. most hawaiians have either some chinese or some european in their bloodline  so some of these hawaiians pull more towards their european ancestry. unless  these people i m talking about are a figment of my imagination  i mean  i know for a fact that these same people would lose their minds if nani and lilo were hawaiian-chinese with the surname  chinen   and god forbid an actual hawaiian-chinese actor from hawaii plays nani in the live action lilo and stitch remake! the outrage!
the hypocrisy from them is hilarious. i dare them to race swap mulan.
i stand with matt walsh.  we need representation in these movies.  to truly feel seen  i need all deep-sea beings  of which i identify as one  to be completely translucent.
i don t know why twitter weirdos would be upset. after all  they just cast the best person for the job  and the movie needed some diversity anyway since every character is hawaiian. diversity is more important than sticking to the source material.
yo i m just hyped they got the same voice actor for stitch
we re not racist also. everyone must be the appropriate skin color. but only when we say so. also  no whites.
if representation matters  it matters for everyone.
hey  radical lefties! your next line will be   but she doesn t look like the character! welcome to our world!!
i just saw an article this morning that netflix is making a movie about the ptolemaic  greek  cleopatra and changing her to be black. so much irony.
the new wednesday is a perfect example on a perfect cast
if they truly wanted to be inclusive of all races  they should just ignore race altogether and hire purely based on acting ability and how well they fit the character. it would still be weird at times  but a merit based system wouldn t really be a problem.
in dune on hbo  the very important liet kynes is turned from a white man with sandy-blond hair to a black ... woman. and chani is turned from a slim woman with red hair  liet kynes  daughter  to ... the half-black leftist zendaya. who also got to replace the white mary jane in spider-man. dune is also filled with blacks  when it should be white and arab characters.
i think we should fully support this movie just to get a second helping of those  hogwarts legacy  tears
tbh i understand that she s hawaiian but would appreciate if the live action people actually remotely looked like the iconic characters that they need to portray
the poor girl looks more like me  i m hawaiian too. a hapa haoule to be exact which means half hawaiian. now if they wanted to go with a full on native look then they should have kept looking because i have a lot of family members with that look  specifically like nani.
i m glad  lilo and stitch  will finally be accessible for all generations to come  and redress of balance within the entertainment industry.
i don t even mind race swaps  idris elba would make an awesome james bond  but if you do it  you have to be cool with doing it both ways! that s equality.
it s weird how you looking at the thumbnail  you two look almost like you could be sisters.
it is! she is pretty!
there are others out there who are also really upset that the person who plays tiana at one of the theme parks isn t as dark as her animated counterpart. people out there just love to say that you are racist if you aren t a big fan of race-swapping done by companies for  progressiveness  but get really butthurt over a slight difference in skin tone.
lilo looks perfect to but stitch being the same the voice actor is hype just disappointed it s getting the disney plus treatment
the director of the original film
i could careless about how lilo and nani look. i m more concerned how stitch is coming out looking  got some major sonic vibes with this remake lol
@88amona  exactly!
dawg what
heimdall  the white  was cast as tv s idris elba in the thor movies. how on the nose can a movie be. and disney gingercide is definitely an open secret at this point.
nice jojo reference
@infamous knight  haha thanks! you saw right through me
but she doesn t look like the character!nani-
anne boleyn  first time
yea  that s not the first time they re race swapping historical figures  it s not just for fantasy. not that  diversifying  myths and legends that are connected to geographical locations and to specific people and their cultures is justified  it s not.
@norman readdis  achilles from troy  been like this for a while now.
@norman readdis  oh i m aware. just thought it was odd that i heard about both of these casting choices the same day
the trailer is already on the netflix channel. it s more of a documentary.
yeah  it s a netflix documentary  so it s even worse. there is a black woman that says her mom told her when she was a kid  i don t care what the schools tell you  cleopatra was black   uhh no. she was mediterranean and probably pretty white haha. we have statues of her from when she was still alive and she was clearly mediterranean.anyway.
@james bee  i mean  she was from a macedonian family that religiously practiced incest.
i still haven t seen it  i felt betrayed.despite its flaws  i still prefer lynch s vision of dune over any woke garbage. i d give a look to the newer movie iteration only because villeneuve isn t so bad at sci-fi... but then again  the wokeness irks me a lot.
@alessandro baggi  me too i prefer 1984 version much better
@alessandro baggi  dune 2021 wasn t woke at all though  it s actually quite good.
@shadowman  to them woke means anything with minorities
in n africa  there are arabs   amazigh  berbers    who.look from e.uropeanto mid e  but some look mixed   blacks.also  in libya  about 40  are blacksfrom chad language family   ethnicitythe former independent gov.of the latemoamar gaddafi helped libyan blacks    w african black guest workers. the us nato imposed war vs libya unleashedright wing racist anti black violence..
bro  it s an alien planet 10 000 years in the future  the human race has been through 10k years of additional evolution and interracial breeding  the spice navigators have been changed into basically a new species  and you want the entire planet to look like arabs
follow disney s example and buy movie tickets as a  gift  to co-workers  that way you can write them off as a business expense.
very difficult. i m sure there are not many hawaii girls that looks exactly the part and also can act .
and then there will be the live action remake for the 3 people who care too.
agree!!! i d love to see idris elba as james bond!
@skynet-t800  yeah but they never go into that in any of the recent movies i ve seen so that s not really an issue.
just make him a different agent that cooperates with bond... 008  could definitely work
disney cast a native hawaiian and some are now furious and rage that the actress playing the role is not black  which is ridiculous because in the animated film lilo and nani are native hawaiian and not an african american and the annoying thing is that those rioters are racist towards the native people of hawaii. probably the same people will be upset next that moana is played by a native polynesian in the live action adaptation of the 2016 animation.
all i know is that the dead father better have a picture shown of keanu reaves.
i have more issues with them trying to remake the movie in the first place. ever since they ran off john lasseter  disney has been just an absolute dumpster fire.
hook is still one of my favorite movies. robin williams was a legend. do what you have to in order to be safe  melonie. have a fantastic weekend
the alien side of lilo and stitch miss some storytelling opportunities  but the relationship between the sisters is great. can you imagine how grotesque current disney will make lilo and nani complicate dynamic
this feels close to home  when i was cast as aladdin at wdw  i thought i was too light skinned as well. but alas  tanning works. at first though  i had many comment on my skin color. which was ok with me as long as they weren t commenting on the fact i am 6 2 playing al haha
great coverage. i had a good laugh with you melonie. always love your go boom!!!
if she is hawaiian  it s completely fine but this is hilarious
you re so real and transparent as you said  my favorite quality of you. do what you have to for your own good though. the people being haters just say the same corny stuff over and over  i don t even listen anymore lol. can t wait to see the new setup  been workin on my batcave setup myself. happy to see a new great video  hope you re having a pleasant day!
if stich isn t played voiced by a real alien we riot
i liked the beauty and the beast remake  even though it doesn t really improve on the original. but at the time  the concept of doing live action remakes was novel. haven t seen another one of these remakes since then.
i can t wait to see what they do with snow white.
well well well. let s see how inclusive they are now. fun fact   hawaiian  isn t a race. samoans come in a great variety of skin tones. so i can t wait to see the impending implosion of logic.
i wonder when disney is going to start doing cartoon remakes of their live action movies.
joker   if i race swap a white character for a black actor  everyone remains calm. then when i race swap a white actor for a darker skinned character  then everyone loses their little minds! great to see you doing a video again melonie! you look beautiful too!
i m convinced disney just wants to change characters so that they are unrecognizable to og fans. if this actress is the best then fine but it s fair to want nani to look as close to nani as possible. honestly  i m more scared to see what stitch will look like
this is going to require a lot of popcorn to sit back and watch this one play out on the public stage.  cue the death threat to the evil mouse  lights  camera  action....  whoever made the joker comment below is a genius.
i like cosplay.  i don t cosplay myself. but i enjoy watching others do it. so  i want the actor to look as close to the original character as possible. these remakes would be making a lot of money if they focused more on us nerds who love seeing real life people look and play out these characters as perfect as possible. i m a perfectionist and as a perfectionist  it is really satisfying to see the effort that goes into making characters on point and accurate.  more often than not  fans are more accurate than the movies.
i ve reached peak apathy where disney is concerned. i only even click on the videos to see my favorite content creators. i couldn t care less what disney does any more.
i like the vintage looking room divider. the old school design aesthetic is definitely right up my alley.
thank you
@melonie mac go boom  you re the best melonie.
she could even be german or scandinavian if she looked the part and her acting is ok with the director...
i agree
they already casted a latina actress for her
@melonie mac go boom  i m just waiting on them to cast raven goodwin or eva reign as elsa for their live-action  frozen .
rachel zeigler has been cast as snow white. gal gadot as the wicked queen. mirror  mirror  on the wall. who is the fairest of them all   you. no contest. snow who
@melonie mac go boom  no white and the seven vertically challenged.
and the evil queen is gadot xd
snow white.. the character s appearance is literally in the name of the story
@harbl99  yeah gal godot shouldn t worried about anyone out-shine her .
@john wright  they re just calling it snow white.  they never actually said there would be dwarves  and there might not be anymore because peter dinklage raised a stink about it being stereotyping and insulting.
@john wright  no white and the seven dwarfs of inclusion and equity. each dwarf will have a distinguishing diversity quirk  or two or three  which is how they earned their name.
probably never
from star wars and star trek to cartoon series on tv
come on melonie get it right a latinx woman.
bahaha so true! and thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom   cast....not casted x
do you know why they do this   it s not about the money... it s about sending a message.
@leland carter  you don t know his money situation though  it might be a drop in the bucket for him  might not be. either way being a hater for donations is whack  and it seems like the only thing you people have to say to the guy. i think y all are just mad you re not the one getting it.
@leland carter  what
@harryhardnips  i personally haven t seen those complaints but obviously it is his decision to give nonetheless. i think it s even more weird to tally up another adults  spending and comment on it but hey  people s definition of  weird  these days is pretty skewed.
@leland carter  that s unfortunate if he s suffering but i m sure referring to his problem as  pathetic  isn t a great way to address it.
@leland carter  an evil grifter    she s not on onlyfans dude.  she s a youtube commentator and andrew is possibly fascinated or infatuated or simply enjoys her videos that much.  it s up to him to control his finances and no one else.  quit being so judgemental ask tupac his take on it!for  3000 a month i d better be getting some major luvin  once a week.
@tracy buzogany  jaisus!! that s just straight up cringe...
twitter in a nutshell
@harryhardnips  my money situation is none of your business. if you re that concerned  my money situation is fine and i have plenty right now. i ve been remarkably blessed with god sending customers to me at my job and i m taking the opportunity to spread those blessings. because i believe that is the lord s will. so you people can just stay mad!
@harryhardnips  i agree with mr. robb  pretty woman deserve nice things.
@harryhardnips  who s andrew
the solution to this would just be to not race-swap characters at all unless there is a good  tangible reason that improves the story and isn t done for diversity s sake. if studios want more diversity they can always just create new characters and stories to satisfy their needs instead.
these activists also see comments like this as a platform to latch onto like a parasite.
we ll if nani wears her crop tops i ll be happy
wait isn t the argument  it doesn t matter because the character is not real    or does that only work for blackswaps
good to see you melonie. love the camo shirt. the picture of her looks like she a redhead. finally a redhead but they would have to change her air.
it amused me in the live-action aladdin remake that they gave jasmine an extra song about how she would not be silent  and then was silenced immediately upon completion of the song
this is awesome  they didn t even hesitate to show their hypocrisy when a casting went the other direction.
i m just waiting for disney to put dylan mulvaney as their new princess. you know they will  it s just a matter of time.
i m so tired of live-action adaptations of animated movies and shows. never as good
do we really need a live action lilo and stitch...
i mentioned that if silk the spider-man character was ever played by you  it would have been a near perfect match so you having that role would have been perfect  if you ever had that part. if anything  if you got a bit of a tan or at least with make up or something you would have been a 1 to 1 look for the part. technology could easily fix that without much effortand a guy on twitter  big shock...  said you looked almost like silk once from the spider-man comics way back when and i added that had you or the character had a couple of skin shades lighter or darker in either way  you or the character would have been a perfect match after saying the same thing and myself being more analytical by nature  said and i quote   there s always that one pedantic person  followed by a spider-man face palm and i have kept the receipts ever since then. i will always say you are a better person than me  because in the words of mike tyson with  social media made y all way too comfortable with disrespecting people and not getting punched in the face for it.  and if i did see him  i would have to fight the temptation to do it and put on a smile.  or just my rbf that i typically have i have next to no ability to lie and i am just being honest.
i didn t know they named the width of a human eye as a syndrome if it gained proficiency at depth perception   field of vision with increased width... shouldn t the inferior version  which is apparently most of us  be the syndrome  all of this just reminds me of faye in cowboy bebop. when that lady said it was unreasonable to find some one with the anime proportions i immediately remembered that there were 3  in just my high school while i was there  that had the  impossible  body proportions. there are easily 100 000  19 year olds with fayes proportions every year  it should have been easy to put out an actual open casting call and find more than one of asiatic descent- they just didn t want to.thank you for loading background object  02. your effort is valued.
this is going to be hilarious i bet it s a huge deal now lmao. i ve been waiting on this.
they complained america chavezs actress didn t have wavy hair and now they complain their hawaiian actress isn t exactly what they wanted.yet black ariel  tinkerbelle and indian peter pan is a-okay.
as a biracial hawaiian  thanks a lot for bringing back memories of how we are not hawaiian enough for others since we don t have the  look . got it a lot from family and it made me reject my roots since i don t  fit in . a black person can become ariel but an actual hawaiian can t be a hawaiian. the rock is not even hawaiian but gets no flack for being cast as king kamehameha in an upcoming movie.
they shouldn t be concerned with how lilo and nani look like. should be more concerned how stitch is gonna come out looking. i m feeling sonic vibes atm.
you work for 40yrs to have  1m in your retirement  meanwhile some people are putting just  10k in a meme coin for just few months and now they are multimillionaires  all thanks to mrs anna   god bless you ma
i would say idris elba as heimdall  zendaya as mary jane and sam jackson as nick fury are acceptions to the rule because in my opinion they all knock their performances out of the park.
lilo and stitch is my alltime favorite classic animated film. if disney butcher that  im never paying for anything disney related ever again. the dealbreaker is gonna be how stitch and the other aliens look. they are walking on a very thin line here.
it never ends.
i think stitch should be green as well. just for the controversies lol
there was backlash about sue storm because she was a brunet and of darker complexion. i thought alba should have taken a part as a vileness.
nope just for characters that aren t fictional creatures and represent actual people
this is them literally just keeping the ip to not go public domain. also disney is lacking on good animators nowadays. most left are broadway activists.
i complain why america chaves was prioritize than other good legacy characters for decades now.
not to mention snow white and full casts of adaptations that are supposed to be fully white casts in the source material.
@norman readdis  good point! they picked the shit new age marvel characters that didn t sell and nobody liked.
@cheesecake is gross  we know why.  reimagine tomorrow .
that s what i would like to understand as well. did dwayne johnson perhaps capture the hawaiian look that people often associate as being native indigenous  just like nani   lilo. in other words  people expect native hawaiians to look more polynesian  not european. that s like casting a white american to play a native american role citing  oh  cuz they re all american anyway .
@seankyle92  well  dwayne is pacific islander as he is half samoan. he has the polynesian look  but it s difficult to say now  facially speaking who is islander or not. there are very few hawaiians who are 50  or more in my generation  and even in hawaii  i have met two full blooded hawaiians in my lifetime. hawaiians are also said to have come from tahiti and samoa  so even pacific islanders are mixed with each other. it s more of the attitude and how you associate with the culture  which i would say dwayne has great respect for. but he does not actually fit the image of king kamehameha. as an islander  sure.
i m with you  i m not half-hawaiian  i m half japanese but i lived in hawaii and remember the days of being called hapa  half . it isn t cool  and i let anyone know it.
wow i  m just shock someone mentioned expert mrs anna i thought i m the only one trading with her
she helped me recover what i lost trying to trade my self

i m now a creditor not debtor anymore.
she s technical analysis is dope and her interpretation projections of the market is so accurate i sometimes ask myself if he is human haha. point is  marueen is the perfect trader to follow for advise and daily signals
she s the key to cryptoshe really made name for herself
i m not here to converse for her but to testify just for what i m sure of  she s trust worthy and best option ever seensometimes i wonder if she s used magic power trade
i ve never heard or seen any of her clients complain of lost....i think she s just too perfect she has made success easier than we thought.
a friend that i referred to her just received  7 050 profit after 10 days of investing....i became jealous.. lol
she s not like other brokers that will star telling you stories and excuses why they trade didn t go well after collecting your money
my first experience with her gave me the assurance that has made me to invest without fear of loosing
any one thereplease how can i reach this mrs anna
yes she is always online massage her now
copy it this way youtube is frustrating
trade with her and remember to share testimonies with others
her method surprises me. when i saw testimonies all over the place i thought it was made up stories till i was convinced and gave it a try and honestly i don t regret the move i made because i invested in a big way
i m from usa       i and two other of my friends tried her immediately we testified  her performing wonders   she gave her clients nice attention
anyone who she handles he s or her trade for l believe is so lucky
yes but do you know l have been paid out today
thanks allot i just sent her a message and he attended to me nicely  such a nice woman
i agree 100  with you i dont care about races  just make the character look like the character in the story books how is it so hard
i can t wait for the live action cars movie next spring
i m just scared of what they re going to make stitch look like especially after seeing what they did to sebastian in the live action little mermaid... yikes
sydney agudong  the actress who will play nani  is part filipino. you can t get more pacific islander  than that but i can assure you  we filipinos are brown  but we know our complexions vary too  there are mestizas and really dark skinned too
listen... she could be brown... she could blue... she could violet sky... she could be hurtful... she could be purple... she could be anything you like!
i think someone needs to tell the  she s a fish and not real  so it s ok  people  that they are both cartoon characters
awesome. cool point you made about the state of things and your opinion not being based on a singular issue. also cool asian woman s privacy wall. its a good symbol of respect to woman and there privacy. its cool that you made another video. i was like what s going on.
i m curious about how good it ll be i love lilo and stitch
i agree  i don t care who they hire as long as they fit the role they have been cast in  case in point is robert downey jr. playing kirk lazarus in tropic thunder lol
they can t be serious !!! they can t be serious !!!  somebody should have seen this coming
dude. hook was so good.
well done. i am all for casting mor black   african american actors in more roles in general  but i am not for changing an iconic or established character to a black person just for the sake of doing it.i do admit i was hopeful when i heard idris alba was being considered for james bomd awhile back  but bind has looked different throughout the decades. sean connery looks different physically from charles bronson i m size  makeup amd age. but i wouldn t want a black superman because they ve been consistent with his look. and admittedly i ve loved superman since childhood  so i don t want him changed like that .my two cents.
melonie  they would probably say it doesn t matter because it isn t made for you.
judging by that thumbnail  she s going to be playing you in the melonie mac movie.
as long as the movie is good  that s all that matters to me
without  double standards   these people would have no standards.
fans and haters of moana are now both pissed.
if an actor looks pretty close to what the character they are playing looks like then i am happy. so if they make sure this actress is very tanned for the role i will be happy but when you have the little mermaid issue i dont like it because its completely different. its the same for gender swapping i hate it. very rarely a major change to the looks of a character works out.
the whole field is now the goalpost.
it was obvious that they changed the skin tone of ariel. so that they definitely change the story as well.
gotta be green  gotta be meangotta be everything morewhy don t you like me  why don t you like me why don t you walk out the door!
as a pacific islander first thing i noticed was that she looked white but she is in fact hawaiin so 1  its not white washing.another thing if we re being honest its not easy to find someone who fits all the boxes as lilo s sister so i was fine with letting it pass.
she looks very much like you in the thumbnail  like you two could be susters or at least cousins.  similar hair and everything.  wouldn t be surprised if she loves tomb raider
still waiting on disney to race swap tarzan. come on do it disney
let s keep it a stack. most ppl just want nani to look thicc af she s was our thicc queen
in the case of jessica alba as sue storm  she wasn t cast for the role because diversity  she was cast in the role because she was a popular actress at the time  and the studio thought she could help sell movie tickets. so  i never had a problem with that race swap  because it wasn t a virtue signal. i d rather a studio be real and cast someone because they think they can make money  which is their goal  right   than a studio cast someone because they re trying to push some fake moral angle on everyone.
maybe she ll hit up the tanning bed for a few weeks prior to filming
disney continues to go on this woke trend just goes to show they haven t learned good video melanie
in the ryan gosling as obama movie  j.p. spears should play big mike
it just looks stupid. i love that line. in regards to your background
good to see you again  melonie! hope you re having a wonderful day.you look absolutely stunning
lol!  melonie knows her football with those goal posts references!
the girl at 2 43 looks just like her  except older. the actress picked is fine also  and everyone needs to get over this stuff in 2023.
how could you have loved princess jasmine as a kid melanie   the internet has told me for the last 8 to 10 years that it is completely impossible to relate to  or admire a character that does not look and act and think exactly like you.  damn it!  i thought that putting everyone into little segregated groups was the only way that everyone could be included.  how can i go back to a disgusting pre-woke world view of seeing people as individuals but with a shared humanity  and associating with people based on the substance of their character and not just because of their race  culture  religion  gender  sexual orientation  and other random things or details that groups identify themselves by
i wasn t going to watch this movie but now i gotta
hear me out disney is on nobody s side and just enjoys twitter drama
i think it s pretty silly that these companies keep trying to race swap unnecessarily  but this is totally fine considering she s actually hawaiian. i know they re just going to start debating colorism once they all realize she s actually hawaiian  but in all seriousness  they are fighting a useless fight here. honestly  i am just sick of race being brought up in every single one of these casting decisions so heavily. it s getting tiresome now. what is people s insane obsession with this coming from also  shout out to the black jimmy carter on the supergirl tv series  though. i didn t read the comics or anything  and i know it was a debate at the time  but i actually really liked his character. i still think the race swapping is pointless  even as a black man who got to see a more relatable character on screen--in terms of black character stereotypes--but he was just genuinely a cool character. generally speaking though  they need to chill out and just make actual unique  new roles for all of these different types of characters that feel natural and nobody would complain. many black shows find great success with diverse audiences. it s not like they can t do it. they re just choosing not too.
had a good ol  laugh last night    so funny
i m looking forward to george clooney playing dr martin luther king.
i can t wait to see what disney does with an old yeller remake.
she looks exactly like the damn character shes playing lol
melonie keep on rocking like the wardrobe in the background
hi melonie. disney seems to hate us all. if that is actress playing nani  then that s fine. just tell a good story though. don t sanitize the original story beyond recognition  like disney would ever do that. lol  . you do look beautiful. . may god continue to bless you and protect you
personally i ve always been try to look the part but if the best person came around but doesn t look but is able to do things  action singing etc  i m willing to give it a pass. i think it s confusing or maybe i need a judge from the olympics to explain how ariel is ok to swap but not nani
the only problem i had with brandy s cinderella  was how a hispanic king and an african queen gave birth to an asian princei saw the red he d stepmother as having married 3 times  or had married 2 black men and in her first giving birth to the 2 girls 1 light skin other dark skin.  then married  brandy s  dad.but in general people can t  change their ethnicities  annie should never have been changed from the comics smurfs are and always will be blue.  gray ones are naughties or fake smurfsbig bird will always be identified as  yellow.kermit as greendisney  areil was one way for over 30 years... they should alter it nowsame with snow white  peter pan and ti kerbell.
go 4 it! watching woke meltdown is a bonus.
the whole ariel is a mermaid  fish it does not matter what her race argument is odd  but if ariel was originally a black mermaid and they would change her into a white ginger  would that argument really apply to these people
i always thought that black heimdall worked not because of the actor s skin color but because the guy is built good and is actually a good actor.
how hard is it to pick a girl that actually looks like nani  good grief.
this is gold
just like i complained about white characters being black washed i also don t like the opposite  when the white wash traditionally colored characters  but is also funny to see how it backfired for them from the same people that they are trying so hard to appeal
what started this problem is that they keep making  non-white  characters look black  they are even saying that dwayne johnson isn t black enough to play maui in the live-action remake! the same thing also happened fairly recently with the ms. marvel s and america chavez s castings. so now real pakistanis  real hispanics  and real hawaiians don t look like caricatures of them.
i thought she was going to say   my favorite disney princess...lara croft.
i ll continue praying for your safety. the lord will protect you. god bless you sister.
all i m saying is cast people the right color  but i guess that only goes one way
i love it. the cope is fantastic. these have absolutely no principles or standards aside from the double standards they hold for everyone else. i too don t find the actress they chose to play nani to really look like here  which is the problem with all of this in the first place.admittedly i d rather disney quit the live action remakes. they are garbage and unnecessary. however it was only a matter of time before they made a casting choice the npcs didn t like and they will squawk and squawk.no consistency on the people who move the goalpost and that is why they don t deserve to be listened to in the first place.
yup  the actress on the thumbnail looks a lot like you...  imagine a wokeist looking at you and you triggering it by doing absolutely nothing lol lilo   stitch  is so bland...wow  the actress also looks like mexican singer telenovela actress thal a! she s beautiful.
love the end of this video  -- take care of yourself  we ll be here!
so  are they going to get real aliens for this movie
can t wait for the bambi live action movie.
everyone knows that when you change the race or gender of a main character  you are changing the plot or surrounding of the story. the authors or screen writers  of the original story or script are undoubtedly sick over this.
not because of the actor s skin color    exactly.  he fit the role  skin color didn t even enter into it at all.
i still think they should ve kept heimdall white because they are norse gods and i think idris is too good as an actor for such a small role  so it s not worthed to change it. anyway i have a bigger problem with valkyrie because that actress can t act to save her life  so at least they should have chosen someone who looks the part
i have to agree  i didn t like having a black hiemdahl  or black people in valhalla at all  it s nordic mythology  christianity embraces all people  but this religion was of and about nordic people   but i have to say he did a good job of it in the first thor movie.
idris elba is a fantastic actor.. he still didn t belong in a depiction of our ancestors cultural history and our heritage. americans just take liberties with other people s stuff.. lol
i agree. if the race-swapping isn t done just for  progressiveness  sake then i am fine with it.
@that norwegian guy    a depiction of our ancestors cultural history a comic book version of sci fi crap is hardly  a depiction of our ancestors .
@modellights  everything about the marvel comics about thor  odin  heimdal  jotunheim ect. is taken directly from my people s culture and our ancestors gods.. they ve just taken the liberty of making it into a comic book.
yeah  for ariel it s okay  but if tiana was so much as changed to latino then people would lose their sh t
if it doesn t feature the rock  it would be a crime against cinema.  check out the trailer on youtube   p
@marinus van zylthe snl sketch that was funny as hell
i m more concerned with what stitch is going to look like.
they can now add april o neal to that picture of redheads being replaced. now she looks like a young whoopi goldberg in the new movie.
i must be the only one who thinks melonie would look so much better without tattoos.  i guess i m just old-fashioned
i m amazed at the level of ignorance people display when it comes to skin color of biracial people. i lived in hawai i and my dad was born there  but my family is japanese. when i there i was dark  but when i moved to the mainland and stayed here i got paler. some people even thought i was white  lol! i m half white  half japanese  technically a quarter ryukyuan from okinawa who are darker skinned japanese people more like islanders. we can tan mfers  we can be different shades. being biracial doesn t erase us from representing both our heritages. please stop.
to be fair  we should be complaining too so we are being consistent about the race colour swaps. if we aren t they ll just say  reee you only complain when inclusion happens not when x is whitewashed  but at the same time that gives them the power to blackwash all the things at this point i m sick of being  represented  bruh i just wanna live my black ass life
if ariel is a fish  is the issue  then explain stitch  how real is he !
i await the day we go full jack kirby dystopia and wear blank face masks and excessive spray on tan just to represent everyone by representing no one.i love omac.
i feel bad for the actress chosen to play nani  as for disney they wanted that fandom. now they got them.
sorry about all that stress you are having to put up with  it is an unfair situation but god bless you for facing it nonetheless.
happy friday melonie mac! have a great weekend
it finally happened lol
i have to say  i miss the empty room already.
you d think disney would change up what they re doing giving how bad the beatings they ve been taking in sales lately. guess that esg money will see them through both lack of profit and public interest. bold strategy  cotton
but melonie  you keep forgetting if they would make everyone look in the movies as they should there would be no outcry and this is clearly a marketing strategy....but yea i agree
while personally  i don t like the casting for nani only certain women can capture perfectly  no offense to this lovely young lady it is funny to watch these people cry because now the shoe is on the other foot. personally  i would like to see a japanese snow white with yokai dwarfs or maybe even an  i don t know  anime inspired movie about princess oichi so we can get our first frigging japanese princess!!!
comment she read at 5 55 was spot on.
i dont know why they re so mad  they just hired the best actor...
the real question is... is stitch a dog  an alien  a koala  or some other creature
what i don t get is when the last fantastic 4 film had a black johnny storm and a white sue storm. they are brother and sister in the comics who have the same parents....nobody ever talks about that. literally changed the origin story to push an agenda...
a lolb  i don t want this. just make her polynesian like she is supposed to be.
yeah  i m a little concerned by people s hypocrisy. but she could easily just tan her skin in the sun for a more accurate look.
@burnt toast.  maybe but as it s her body that s a decision that only she can choose to make
@ace productions  fair
why doesn t everyone uses  actress  anymore for someone who look a woman
@alessandro baggi  they find the sexist or whatever. it s stupid  i know.
an alien koala
never cared about the live action films  but enjoyed the entertainment of reactions and hypocrisy behind it.  yah do not blame you  stay safe.
a quotation from you about the anheuser-busch statement was mentioned on the huffington post s story about this.
it s extremely hypocritical from them to justify the race swaps and cultural appropriation of canonical native european characters or characters that reflect native europeans in myths and legends while adapting their cultural properties  but then cry that a hawaiian inspired character was  race swapped  with an actress that is native to hawaii.in the past when they did race swaps from time to time it was minor and not massive as part of a clear political agenda to remove white characters from screen. now it s a part of a radical political agenda and they re trying to justify the race swap of ariel who is a danish character  described in the story as a white woman  and her story is also a cultural property of denmark and of the danish people.
hook was more of a sequel and great movie.
i am giving siena agudong a chance.  she a hapa haole with native-hawaiian blood.   also  she is also a pinay filipina like the original voice actress of nani  tia carrere  which she hawaii born  no native blood .  as long  siena agudong keeps the lingo and spirit of a local hawaii born... and maybe light sibling abuse...  i will be okay with that.
that thumbnail almost made me think you had a long-lost sister lol
they should switch the actresses for ariel and nani  and then we d have great casting.
i d watch it
if god mixed everyone in a blender and made us all look the same  people would still find ways to divide us.
can we get a background mural of a bunch of furniture drawn poorly in ms paint
@2 17 you both look like you could be sisters or cousins.  disney should have given you the part if they are gonna keep doing major race swaps.   see if they can replace stitch with baby yoda also xd
a taste of their own medicine
of course they are complaining. there is no reasoning with spoiled children who expect to get what they want when they want it. you just have to say no.
them  it s only ok when we do it!!!
racist twitter made a light skinned hawaiian is cast as her. me - shows meme off the dozens of gingers cast as black people fallowed by  first time
personally i think danny devito should have been cast in the role  if you re gonna go whackadoo go full wackadoo. lol
it is unfortunate that you cannot express yourself more freely because of those crazies. makes me despise them even more
nani was hawaiian. i am hawaiian. i am confused as to how they could mess this up  that said  lots of hawaiians are hapa. thats hawaiian and mixed ethnicity. im willing to give it a chance  but they could have picked someone more hawaiian  instead of haole. id like to be represented in one of the only movies that has a hawaiian character. i dont believe even moana has any hawaiians  as the characters are polynesian and samoan. maui is a hero in the polynesian stories  but he is technically hawaiian. he is played off as a big samoan. for most people  you dont need to understand all that because you dont live here in the islands. im ok if the person playing nani is at least from the islands  but if not  what a bad casting.
i m fine with her because she s already hawaiian  a tan would be a plus. but damn...these hypocrites
next up  the princess and the frog 2 starring brie larson.
exactly  and i believe that the majority of people who are upset are white  not those who are of these minority groups  albeit i could be wrong  this is just from personal experience and other similar situations regarding progressiveness
so true
that s blackface! reeee
she was cast as the frog
@kainis01  nah the frog has personality
i get it  brie is the mean witch with a b.
nani better be tall and thick like in the animated original. doubt she can top tia carrere.
the actress is born and raised on kauai and has hawaiian ancestry.  ain t no hawaiians mad about it.  the truth is locals speak pidgin.  it s in the original.  it s really hard to get right.  it s a local test that many non locals fail.  she will pass the test  kauai pidgin is way more nuts!
no  just no - all of the cast should be hawaiian and the big sister better be smoking hot. edit  but this girl is a dead ringer to nani
any plans to come to the uk i m hoping to make the fnt meet-up when gary comes across
as a half filipino half white guy  this is basically what weve been dealing with our whole lives that were too white or too other so im sure shes used to it.
how does it feel now
disney needs to burn up way more money on live action remakes that keep bombing. it s funny to watch them trip up every time.
disney is so incompetent i swear. can t they understand we just want characters to remain what they originally were  we aren t asking them to make black characters white  we are trying to get them to stay true to the character. in this case it isn t about the actress being hawaiian  she just doesn t look like the original character.
i m ok with this casting she literally has background of her culture it s literally diverse casting what are we crying and complaining about jeez this generation is so stupid
tbh i would much rather have a live action of this than moana
light skinned hawaiians are real! i m a light skinned hawaiian and there s alot of us!
if shes born and raised in hawaii then thats good enough for me. for those that dont know hawaii has a lot of portuguese people and they have been well integrated into local culture to the point that it doesnt even cross peoples minds that portuguese is technically white. they are local and thats all that matters
do you think with recent flops like antman and shazam  and the mega success of the mario movie  that the superhero movie bubble will finally burst  and be replaced with a video game movie craze
this is refreshing. twitter activists need to step away from their computers and breathe air.
this actress doesn t look hawaiian enough to play a hawaiian character... but idris elba was just fine to play a norwegian character... makes total sense...
i boycott disney in general  doesn t matter if the film is woke anymore because of the damage they have already done and their stance on everything.
are there not any animators anymore  i could ve sworn disney made cartoons but for some strange reason they are trying to make movies now and failing every time miserably.
we just want characters to look like the source material.. i don t want a remake of the little mermaid with a black woman replacing white ariel as much as i don t want them to remake pocahontas with a white woman cast for her. if you re doing a remake it s for nostalgia. how can you have nostalgia if none of the characters look the same! it doesn t mean if they re playing a black or white person they need to be pedantic and be 100  dna test black or white or be a specific nationality right to the google maps gps coordinate ! just cast someone who looks like them! it s like when sofia vergara played lara croft in a tomb raider ad  she s not a white british person but she looks like lara. these franchise heads love to get woke points by race swapping  in spite of fans
if you think this is bad  wait until you guys see stitch. that will give you guys something to complain about.
you know i m happy to not care about disney products anymore. and i m happy that nintendo hasn t done this  needless to say gannon still looks like gannon  and all zelda characters are pretty much the same. i also like the back wall.
they are already working on that one.
true that.
another fun fact. us census bureau was lazy with documentation for years and clumped people that have ancestry in the same regions as the same race or ethnicity. sometimes if people spoke or even sounded the same  the bureau would group them together lol
according to disney  there are no plans to remake pocahontas  which is reasonable considering it is horribly outdated and outright offensive to those of native-american heritage  and also disney doesn t give a sh t about nostalgia  that much is clear by the fact they just want to make headlines for being  progressive  and put low effort into many of these remakes
@ace productions  aww that s a shame  i didn t know that was the case. pocahontas is my favourite disney film after the little mermaid and probably the only other disney princess movie remake i would be interested in seeing.such a shame they don t care about nostalgia when these films are so tied to good memories of people s child hoods  they have millions at their disposal and could do things that are really special
mario killed disney  so it doesn t matter much anymore.  great video!
the real question is who stole all of melonie s toys!and who s behind that screen!we need to know!
what i find interesting is that disney has no problem casting black actors for white characters but they turn around   do this
this is like if they made nick fury white
lol did they really ! !  xd
maybe...as compensation for making ariel black  they can make tiana light skinned and red headed  think jazmine from the boondocks  if i remember correctly  for the live action princess and the frog
snow white was written for inclusion and diversity  may the best man win for the role.
race swapping is so great  stunning and brave!!!
hawaiian s have a diverse culture  with influences from chinese  japanese  filipino  portuguese  irish  etc. they have what s called local howlie  meaning white people who were born and raised in hawaii. casting a dark skinned actress from the mainland to play a local hawaiian is arguably more offensive.
they really did have lost their mind
april oneal made blackariel made black and every woke person saying it s just fiction don t get mad but this happens now and they losing there heads crazy
i would ve gone for a darker-skinned actress  myself. that said  i m having way too much fun laughing at these hypocrites. wouldn t surprise me if disney suddenly announced they were changing actresses last minute to appease these losers  though.
having lived in hawaii and knowing for a fact native hawaiians are a rarity this day   age. it doesn t necessarily surprise me that she was chosen. but there are mixed-race hawaiians that are light-skinned.  it wouldn t make sense to hire just any polynesian  but i know many samoans are kinda triggered by this.
i m gonna give the actress who played triss marigold a pass bc i actually liked her. but there is redhead erasure going on.
the only criticism i have is she looks a bit too young but whatever  i hope it isn t another turd. also you might want to look into alan menken having to remake the songs for little mermaid so they were more progressive.
people have their priorities wrong here. the real question should be  is she as thicc as nani
i look more hawaiian then that actress  come on  disney
jungle book is great  even if only for  more cow bell.
i don t understand why disney don t keep the races as they have been always
and she s even hawaiian just a little lighter lol
oh how the turns have tabled! loool
tiana wasnt supposed to be black to begin with but most people dont know this. that movie was based off of e.d. baker s frog princess book series and they changed everything including setting  time period  race  and even the type of magic used. it wasn t voodoo magic in medieval europe  that s for sure. oh and the princess  name  because she was a real princess like with a castle and everything  was named emma and the prince was named eadric.
@karenalyse  interesting. thanks for sharing.
@kel p  anytime. always willing to share my love for this books
finally. a man of culture
did c. walken dub some character in the live action movie  when my wife s family put the movie on  some years ago during christmas  i admit i slept through its entirety and never even tried to see it again.
people obsessed with watching short videos because of attention issues   inability to keep thoughts consistent  omitting details in someone s argument because its inconvenient to yours  or because the words had too many letters   a new chall-gender has joined the battle  goldfish
idc who it is  i want my white characters to stay white and my black characters to stay black etc
i hate to be that person  but i m gonna be that person well now you guys know how it feels when you do it to us.
the same people who pretend to hate racism  for some reason don t understand that the result of a culture that has moved passed racism is a ton of mixed race people. many hawaiians are mixed  and they are not less hawaiian just because one of their parents is white and their skin color is lighter.let s just call racism  racism. they just don t like white people. they hate white people so much its not enough that she s actually hawaiian. she still reminds them of who they hate too much. this is how obsessed with skin color these  anti  racists are.
the only thing i hate about the new ariel is the unnecessary and emotionally out of place vocal run she does on the last line of  part of your world .i hate it when people do that. just showing off at the expense of the emotional content of the song. and it no doubt is a reflection of how they will approach the rest of the movie. not that i would have watched it anyway...
racism against a hawaiian woman for not being  dark enough . incredible!
i like the empty background.  spartan life best life.
feel sorry for that actress  disney being woke af might respond to the outrage and fire her.
the fact that they make the characters with darker skin tone in the 2d film was already a racist move  not all hawaiian have that color tone  they were mistaken someone who s from the aboriginals or maori.
i assure you  no one is mad about this. i saw a random ass article pointing to a random ass tweet and that tweet was being ripped to shreds in the quotes. so no  it doesn t represent the overall sentiment towards the casting.
tbf she doesn t look the part. but this is hilarious. if u can believe in aliens on earth then u can believe nani doesn t have to be darker skinned. hilarious double standards
i m gonna stick with the animated versions that will always be superior to these vapid live-action remakes.
don t disney have enough nails in their coffin already
people  complain all the time it doesn t matter what people s race are when playing a role in the film. in the same sense people act like it s ok to just dismiss what someone looks like and should don t look like the character. double standard when it comes to these people who complain a lot but in reality what s most important is if they can act and are like the character.
they forget nick fury. now anytime he is portrayed anywhere he is a sam jackson looking character. i would argue sam jackson played the role so well that nobody gives a damn though.when i pointed out the race swapping of ariel years ago  people on twitter went crazy telling me how stupid i was and she s a mermaid  not human. yeah  that s just a dishonest take. if ariel had dark skin and wore an african style top then was played by a white girl in the remake....need i say more
she kinda looks like you melanie   maybe  i cannot decide lol
good luck finding a suitable actress for the part who is not mixed race. the majority of hawaiians are hawaiian asian caucasian etc. light skin is very common. my children are quite pale.
here s a novel idea disney knock it off with the live action remakes!!
i normally don t care when they race swap like that if the actor actress can actually portray the character well  but the whole hamilton thing was just stupid  he was a real person. how do they defend that
please  let me give you an example of race-swapping that was very popular in a completely shit movie that was very popular.have you seen the movie   starshit troupers   based on robert a. heinlein s book   starship troopers .in that movie  they not only race swap... they sex swap... and worse.in the book... juan rico  the main character... is a filipino . at the end of the book  this is even emphasized when juan says a quote in tagalog.for the movie  which was warped into being anti-nazi propaganda because verhoven is a breathing piece of shit  he s a very aryan looking blond.further... the character of  dizzy flores ... was also filipino... and a man . he also... died in the first chapter .
you won t be saying that if disney hired a white woman to play princess tiana in a live action princess and the frog movie
@cj gamer  you don t know what i ll think or say.
@cj gamer  plus i don t like live action disney movies  at least for the classics.
@yuuta moto  how come you don t like live action disney movies
@cj gamer  because they always suck.. never live up to the animated version
to be fair they didnt make mary jane black. they made a new character named michelle jones
when jessica alba played sue storm... i cared. i complained and got called racist.the race swapping that still outrages me the most is valkyrie. they replaced what are supposed to be nordic  angelic-looking beings with a butch  dark-skinned skank.
does disney think this will silence us  we don t want that  why should we like to repeat the mistakes of others
so to go all out on hiring voice-over actors... does that mean if you have a handy capped character that you have to hire a voice actor with the same handy cap  or actually hire various actors for each and every character vs hiring a talented voice impersonator  when do we stop pandering and catering to childish wokeism tantrums
we have not only  black people  playing characters traditionally white for 200 of more years - that were written white or even male and suddenly black females  but we also have black people playing historical real people  that were white.   then in this cartoon they aren t even changing the race or gender but you can t give the voice part to the most talent...you gotta be woke til you choke.   makes me wonder if these people complained when they found out that the bluemen weren t really blue underneath the makeup.
okay  the title is a good meme. lol
all this does is proves that disney is racist. don t hire the person who is right for the role. hire the person who fits your criteria for what demographic they re pandering to at the moment. the reaction to all this will be interesting  to be sure.
you re pretty awesome  miss mac
this is a story about a little girl who adopts an alien lifeform grown and created to cause mass mayhem and hysteria  only to teach it the importance of love and family. why does it matter what color the skin of some of the humans is
i m just done with the remix altogether and honestly  this one s the dumbest idea they ve had yet actually know the dumbest a snow white that s not changing but seriously i m done with the remakes but the double standard about this is hilarious.
black annie   im done!
i am happy to see disney do race swaps  upsets the people and they boycott the movie and disney loses money  love it.
oh this is gonna be funny a f
regarding jessica alba  she can play any character she wants and she would be a good fit for the role. girl is literal perfection incarnate. convince me otherwise
speaking of gingers  i have a conspiracy theory i m working on...i m beginning to suspect we ve been lied to about neanderthals.we re given this image of them as these cave men with overhanging brow lines and broad flat noses  and receding chin.we re also told that redheads blondes with blue green eyes got those traits from their neanderthal ancestors.but  celtic nordic people generally have narrow noses  sometimes longer  no particularly overhanging brow  and fully developed chins. the narrow  long nose would be an evolutionary adaptation to the cold  and you re telling me our homo sap ancestors coming out of africa had this  but neanderthals who lived in the cold climates far longer... didn t i think they re trying to hide the fact that neanderthals were  on average  a far more beautiful people than homo saps. which is why we genocided them.
no lara croft reference   i m kind of disappointed  i m just kidding .  maybe eventually disney will realize that we don t actually like these remakes  there s just no point to them  all it does is make people rush to the older versions.  or is that the point   whatever  i m basically done with modern disney.jasmine is my favorite disney princess too  i really liked the aladdin movie growing up  i first saw it on my 5th birthday.  really fun movie!!!
fyi the only 100  hawaiians live on the secluded private island of niihau maintained specifically for that reason. kids can leave in their teens but if they only have like months to decide whether to come back. you can t visit there. the rest of the island is mixed with all kinds of peoples
should have been an irish ginger for maximum hilarity.
i know this is a time to gloat  but i honestly don t care about that. they need to switch the character back to her original ethnicity. she s polynesian  she should be polynesian.
the women in lilo and stitch are cartoon representations of hawaiians so as long as the people who play them are hawaiian what s the gripe  also little mermaid is a danish fairy tale so race swapping that is significantly more offensive from an cultural appropriation pov.
gal gadot...  nuff said  jk  they re both beautiful and capable enough
sounds like some amish arrangement  but for racial reasons instead lol
when winnie the pooh changes to a black bear.
it s funny to see the hypocrisy unfold on twitter over this compared to how the woke people loved ariel cast but hate this. woke people don t see further from their own standards
they forgot about red in shawshank redemption.
hook isn t disney.also  the only decent remake was malificent  mainly because it s not a remake  but a full on retelling. that said  it s still not great.
this is great. this is true equality. i was really hoping that bucky barnes was the black panther in wakanda forever. after all he is the white wolf. but you wanna talk about outrage. they would have burned the theater down.
i too don t care what race an actor is as long as the character they are portrayed as  remind me of that character.  for instance  mary jane in mcu spiderman  i absolutely hate.  it s not because of her race  it s because her character doesn t remind me of mary jane.     she doesn t look like mary jane and she doesn t act like mary jane.  she looks and feels like a different character who has the same name.
if pervywood was really serious about diversity and inclusion and representation we would get a white mlk and a black hitler.
even with the shoe on the other foot  the typical crowd is doubling down.
beauty and the beast was the only good quality live action remake disney has produced.
it s almost as if their arguments aren t genuine.
hehe so ariel is only half-human therefore it does not count  so they say only pure people count
i want my nani to have some meat!
need to race swap disney s princess frog.
you can never please those weirdo activists.
that race swap meme image is missing nick fury.
you missed the real story that really proves your point... they did cobra bubbles dirty and everybody of every race agrees this was a terrible choice.
i bet she gets a tan before filming and ends up looking more like the cartoon.
but.........shes literally of pacific island heritage! shes hawaiian! does she have to look like some national geographic islander type
i haven t watched anything disney in like 20 years the last disney movie i watch was lion king i quit caring about disney  the moment i discovered pro wrestling
alexander hamilton was a real person lol. they totally ignored that part of nuance bro s comment
why not recast t challa bp with another black actor  it s not like boseman invented the character.they should ve just dedicate the movie to him.c. reeves superman was very much loved in the role  but no one killed off superman because the actor couldn t act normally anymore because of his injury.
cobra bubbles better be ving rhames.
well we knew they were disingenuous we need to stop being surprised they don t follow the rules and start stopping them
disney is just trolling at this point.
and yet they wonder why their stock and ratings are plummeting and also they wonder why they re no longer the reigning king of the box office after losing top animation spot to the super mario bros movie
ok  besides the fact that it still puzzles me  why disney  and others  are obviously incapable or unwilling to hire actors  that visually resemble the characters they are supposed to portray... one way or the other. buuut i suppose we all know the answer to that. besides that... ha hahahaha lol!  i hope  their  brains started to melt  when the news got viral! double standards  gosh what a mess...
did i just stumbled into a parallel dimension
please don t let them win
about ginger genocide  netflix had the guts to blackwashing the greek macedoniana queen celopatra  the irony is cleopatra was probably ginger  or at least her hair were reddish xd
this is what disney did. they mixed up the cast for both movies.sydney agudong was supposed to play ariel.halle bailey was supposed to play nani.wait  sydney aqudong is from hawaii! what the fuck is the problem! ! is she supposed to paint her face black
black cleopatra
melanie mac she looks like she s 12 but she s actually 36 lol
melonie for nani
life is full of double standards
disney  done gotem with the no-u! done gotem with the no-u!  lolololol
just throwing this out there  was the zendaya casting really a swap or just a fact she s still a bigger name than tom  her name on the marque means butts in seats  who s this tom holland guy going to get on this side of the pond
makes them look pretty stupid to me no you got it right the first time you said it they are hypocrites!
there was a big outcry about the little mermaid lol.
hook with robin williams is a great movie. but how about a live action of the brave little toaster 1987. she does look like lilo yes but she is for sure black. kid me seeing the little  mermaid in the movie theater  yup wood for ariel. you forgot about robocop remake instead of lois female white girl partner. he was black named jack  i will also add quite the shitty movie compared to  robocop 1987 ultra violence and a compelling story something missing in movies today.
this one i do not care about because i don t even like the original. but i do find it funny.
i did like aladdin   the lion king 2019.
get ready for the outrage
it s a fictional character  y u mad tho
this actress better be from kauai specifically or i ll be pissed
they can see how it feels now. so don t cry
melonie is stuck in the backrooms!
i don t care if they race swap anything i just want actual great stories no just this vile spew  mutated  creatures they try to pass off as our beloved characters of our childhood figures we all grew up with when they could of easily is bring back ariels friend mixed her in the  little mermaid  we all know then made a spin off!!!
hell they even race swapped anne boleyn
if they wanted to modify their animation films then they should ve done them in cg animation so that it s atleast in art spirit but noooo  y all can t help y all selves from from ruining what was already perfect. what a shame  not only that what a way to celebrate a 100 years of a studio let it go up in flames while you re at it but atleast we ll still atleast have their former glory atleast.
the only good live action disney was jungle book. but i mean dang these folks are so hypocritical if they get mad at this.
nintendo is going to kick them off the charts.disney forgot the reason they became a household name. it s not about live action remakes.
they are crazy. why even try to be rational with those people
i m new to the channel.. i can t figure out what it is.. she s ridiculously cute for some reason. definitely a beautiful woman  but is it the geeking out on comics and games  i m lost..
i think a lot of these head empties don t even know the definition of acting. having to be the exact character you are portraying isn t acting. it s vlogging.
they also took away cobra bubbles smh
why make a live action of lilo  seriously why
let s do a race swapped frog princess next! i dare you  disney.
the room is smaller than budweiser s profit margin
i want tom and jerry to be recast!
wait did hell freeze over
but is this actress hawaiian descent  disney must listen to fans because whatever it does will got it wrong about ethnicity  change sometimes is good but some times is bad  if a change is good it has to be rightful  worth and respectful. we must convince disney to listen the audience. the audience are the real judge.
she wasn t supposed to be black to begin with if we re going based off of the book series they claim they based the movie off of.
wow. they had one job and already failed spectacularly. keep doing that  disney! hopefully this series of ls will speed up the bankruptcyas for the double standards  i don t think the descriptor is really applicable because these twitter freaks have no standards at all
the movie might be good
i m confused. she s a multi-generational hawaiian.
just wait for the next reboot of tomb raider in movies or tv  they will make her black i swear
they should cast a albino. ultimate seethe.
same people are ok with  netflix black cleopatra  which was a historical person  not a fictional character
its time to hit them with it s a different universe it s not made for you
the left   it s just a beer  why you so triggered hahahaha also the left   nani is not dark enough!!! this is a travesty!!!! reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hopefully she gets a tan before filming lol
why is disney going nuts on live-action remakes anyway  how about some original fare
i say anyone who is seen complaining about this on the twitterverse should be reported and banned... afterall thats what happened when the situation was reversed wasnt it  d
i wonder if they will be called toxic fans when this flops. sad that they don t get the irony.
i m ok with this
seems like the producers are trying to piss off the parents but when other producers do the same thing now it s bad. same company different producers how ironic....
please can you talk about the riley gaines attack situation  melonie
ariel s at the bottom of the sea how would she be dark
oh now that s funny lmfao
5 10 so where is the mandarin  iron fist  the ancient one
hahaha oh you know the wokies are going to lose their minds saying shes not dark enough...
don t people got better things to do besides getting mad over a fictional character what world do we live in
with the  reimagine tomorrow  company system  please stop giving them money nowadays.
old news zzzzzz
tomorrow you ll wanna talk dali lama
shoulda cast dwayne johnson as nani.
remember when people got mad at disney for casting naomi scott as princess jasmine cause she s part white part indian and not arabic.
as an orangutan  i am offended that they are trying to remove gingers from history. also remember to drink water. stay safe. take care. have fun.
sorry rock but we need a real hawaiian to play maui...and no it s not jason momoa. i m thinking jack black lol
ah the true colours of these people are showing pun intended!
the actress probably just needs to get a bit tanned. her skin in the photo just looks a bit whiter than it probably actually is  which is super easy to fix. at least she s the right descent.
i don t what is wrong i love it  next we need a white black panther
black jimmy olsen and mary jane  no!
wotc also made aragorn black
i hope this makes it clear that this isn t about black vs white  we are all able to come together to condemn race-swaps no matter what colour we happen to be. it s tacky and wrong  no matter which direction it happens
if it s only suited to what they want  then they re just a bunch of spoiled brats. have the opportunity taken away from them
b-but i thought that race doesn t matter. at least that s what i m told literally every time a white character is race-swapped.
netflix is producing a  documentary  about cleopatra and despite all the historical facts that prove she is greek  they are making her black.  so much for a factual documentary.
but lilo and stich character are not while  so now i wonder if lilo will be a blonde little girl  wtf disney is thinking swapping races.
don t forget batgirl
did you know  heimdall in norris mythology is known as the whitest god of them all.
i never saw lilo   stitch.  is it good
me a  white passing  samoan.......i feel for the girl bc she s gonna catch hell.
this girl looks hawaiian.
i miss ginger characters
i can almost see his ex wife agent demanding it.
it s great  definitely worth a watch!
she kinda looks like you
it s almost as if  race  is a social construct
stay safe mel
stop the gingercide disney!
all i care about is if she is actually hawaiian. as long as she is  i don t care. the rock is only half. if they had cast emma stone  i would understand the outrage for the same reason all of these other race swaps annoyed me.
if she s hawaiian i don t really see what the problem is. other than skin color. which in and of itself shouldn t even be a problem. i rather they would have done an animated continuation or something  kind of  their animated stuff is also very poopy now . disney is dead to me pretty much.
wtf!  nani is hawaiian not a haole!
why does disney hate us
live action disney has been a dumpster fire across the board lately.  leave lilo and stitch alone  i say!
so white blade and nick fury next marvels films lol
a lot of these live action shows they aren t very good compared to the originals
why would they get ariel to play lela  never mind  i don t care.
double standards and hypocrisy from the woke mob  nah  that neeeeever happens!
shrek remake but shrek is blue dragon has a moustache and donkey is a dog
2 45 i think that girl looks mixed race. black  hawaiian   and mexican or something. but yeah she looks like nani for sure
they should have casted someone else imo.
milan came out ok
she looks hawaiian 100   just like any black person looks american.
also not to spam the comments they recently race swapped cleopatra in a docuseries.
oh there s a thing in the room nownice
i don t know dude. i wish i had an answer.
half hawaiian  half filipina .there aren t many pure hawaiian around .
animated lives matter!
i like how all these non hawaiian woke people are criticizing a casting of a hawaiian actress for a hawaiian character.
when we complain about race swapping amd they complain  throw this in their face and ask em if it feels good.  yes  im petty
a wild divider appears!!!
don t worry melonie it s all good  we are not here to watch your background...
just stop paying attention to these media sources  life without cable will still continue lol... people hating what they see but still putting money in their pockets when they view these shows  movies and news stations. our perception creates the want.
you have beautiful hair
it s very silly she is a hawaiian she is just not dark enough most mix people have that issue we are told we are too white
these people have no standards at all
we already had black anne boleyn and are about to see black cleopatra. so please give us white malcolm x  white obama  white muhammad ali. someone  please do it.
i really loved it when the cast a black woman to play anne boleyn. lol
a 1 minute article stretch to 13 min. well it s funny nonetheless.
wait whats wrong with black elves this is kinda where you lose me. aslong as it isnt race swapping a histroical figure  an established character  or the actor actually does really well in the role and it s not pandering  then whats wrong with it  elves  arent real so that means they dont have a racealso this person is literally hawaiian so how is this a raceswap
hook was a good film though
sheez why race-swap   just create new characters where included  other  races make sense.
i still hate race swapping  but the popcorn is in the mirco wave for the copium show so..
anyone else see someone try to use a quora page to prove hamilton was black when he was 100  white
she s hawaiian so
wow
vertically-challenged. and there is a gingercide in hollywood right now. jen psaki was the last redhead anyone ever hired. scared em off....
this is the movie age where 50  of male characters are made female  the industry is a joke now
how the turn tables. lol
oh no wait let s see what the internet says
over the hedge live action but the animals are protecting there homes from the humans
kwasade for the algorithm.
leave lilio and stich alone that was my childhood ruined even more
gooooooooooooo gooooooooood looooooooord nani is samoan from hawaii
but a black man portraying william the conquerer is totally fine. soo historically accurate.
nani !
recastnani she needs a tiny bit more melanin
mel  seriously  that black girl does not look like nani. eyes  nose  facial structure all different  only thing she has is the color.
the hypocrisy is strong within the sjw s.
skincolor shouldn t be important. can the actor surf and kick a car
i m just tired of the money grab while putting in anti work  reimagining  of classic movies and tales for  modern audiences
chick in the thumb nail kinda looks like you
cleopatra is now brown according to to netflix.
seemingly  disney only has a race-swap button. at least she is hawaiian.try green screening yourself into a tomb until you get setup
isn t the live action snow white dark skinned
but it s not even the same thing couse the actress playing nani is still hawaian. so it s better than disney chaning white charactrers race intirely.
if i went out with a black woman then i have a thousands of friends and family members tell me how dumb i am for be with a black woman but also if i go out with a white woman then my friends and my whole family members would tell me that i did a great job with picking a lady for my type. anyway it does not matter what color their skin color is that it is okay to be having a different color for a woman who has a job for a real live disney movie or tv show of lilo and stitch  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to make a point and comment on your video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today   hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great weekend too melonie.
no she doesn t
how about just don t make a love action lilo   stitch  make an animated sequel or make something original.
@ryang  yes she does
nononoo melonie it s the turns have tabled xd!!
nani!!!!!
wait wait  she got waardenburg syndrome  lol.
i dont like it  youre telling me they cant find someone with acting talent that looks vaguely like the character
lets not forget that the girl is part black which last i checked was not hawaiian.  they should have had a real hawaiian play the role but then they should have had a real red headed blue eyed white girl to play ariel so...
let me see if i get this straight genie in aladdin ariel the little mermaid the black panther and so on as far as disney characters are in marvel were concerned but yet when you switch nani as being caucasian interracial it s not okay what kind of world do we live in to where there s a double i mean it s one thing for the ridge in the politician that s something totally different but if you think about it it s the same dag on thing leave these characters if they were wife when they were drawn leave them white if they were dark-complected then leave them dark complected quit trying to switch the race there was a reason why people like good story and it was well if it s not broke don t fix it
crazy times
we re just allergic to same-race castings now i guess
this is true  it is double standards. but we aren t allowed to talk about that because white privilege exists and we re racist apparently. they swapped out ariel  tinkerbell and snow white but that s fine because they are all using the excuse that  those aren t real people  it s not relevant to the story . ok then.. not the point but ok..
glmroadhouse
haha.  be careful what you ask for.    hehe.
i ma say this is stupid to complain about the leo and stitch cuz the actress is actually hawaiian but also think it s stupid when people was complaining about ariel and tinkerbell those are not fictional thing the mermaid in the fairy are not real so why does it matter i m wondering if somebody please answer me this cuz i was asking this on social media
is it racist that i thought both girls on the thumbnail were melonie
so it is ok to have a european black fish girl but not a lightey playing a sort of browney.
reversal!!!!!
i  u
both ariel and nani are wronged
jasmine should ve lost her hand
since there was a black male elf in rangs of powwa  why weren t there any female elves of color  and why didn t they make galadriel a black woman  huh
i dont really think there is any way for a black woman with an afro to look like a character that was originally white with long blonde hair thats why i dont like race swapping of original characters
troll bait  but i ll answer anyway...in this case  storytelling   characters being fictional or depictions of real people  doesn t influence the fact that race-swapping is always wrong if compared to creating a new character and story  not to tell how disrespectful towards authors and fans this malpractice is...
haha! i m white and native american so maybe that s why she and i look similar  both mixed
fir- no just kidding  i know mel s video will be great
you don t think this double standard is manufactured
what are you talking about this looks very feng shui
oh how the tables have turned lol. i have no interest in disney and their or hollywood s wokeness. they deserve all the backlash.
the whole point of acting is to act something you re not but the problem is the characters don t look the part. all this actress gotta do is get some spay on tan and she be good. not sure why they won t just white face a black people when they race swap people in other movies. rdj was black faced for his role as a black guy and that was good. it would have been bad if he wasn t black faced for that part.
so let me get this straight. it s ok to turn the little mermaid black because that s a fictional character but it s not it s not ok to turn a colored character white. that one reason why racism will never stop because hypocriticism doesn t stop racism.
let them melt down
spray on tan
she is hawaiin
i don t get why wokies are so upset
she s samoan why are people being so ignorant about this thats like being angry that the rock was casted as black adam he s not kahndaqi he s somoan  people need to find new hobbies.
what about the black anne boleyn  hollywood is trying to change history.
commenting to feed the algorithm
@meloniemacgoboom
we all knew the left would lose their shit when a darker skin character isn t the correct shade .
i would be interested if they  darkened  her skin tone with makeup  how flipped out would people be.
have to ruin elves the most gorgeous fantasy creatures to ever exist
what if mulan was black
she s not a haole. people need to stfu about it.
aren t mermaids half-human  that person s argument don t even make sense based on what was said
disney casts you
i can t wait for when they announce mertle  the little white girl.
i know this off topic but im really getting scared and worry for conan the barbarian. i ll be honest those racist do not want to start this war the moment they touch conan. lol
they set the sharks loose they ate  everything now the sharks are eating eachother
i dont even care. these live actions have been terrible for me since lion king.
meh  boycott disney regardless.
nick fury irritated me.
just cast them as their original race for the love of god
so we can have a black tinkerbell and ariel but a slightly light skinned nani  that s an actual hawaiian  that s white washing.....
mary jane was swamped.  even if she a good actress and cute but mary jane not a red head no more
hope they picked her for her acting  skills.  i could careless about this.  movies sux
haha!
eh  but it s always been a double standard even before the disney woke train. asian characters have been swapped by white people numerous times before  dbz  ghost in the shell  the last airbender  etc. . just keep the characters looking how they re supposed to. that s it.
she not white she is half white and filipino
part of me doesn t care because it s going to be bad like all of their live action adaptation have been. don t see it being the exception. the other part is mad because this is hypocrisy and needs to stop. like come on just keep it like the original. anyway just love seeing  these activists cry and have a tantrum as it just funny to me.
well tbh the white light skin has always been the default for the main character for years so i thinks the arguments are valid  other people exist and we want to see ourselves be represented in a main character light
this i like them rami shouldn t of plated freddy mercury because they think egyptians are black other africa s  even tho rami is egyptian desent
so race mixing is a magnificent  beautiful  almost mandatory thing except when the result of it happens to have light skin. i think i have a brain aneurysm now. these people praised the heck out of prey  which had a cast so obviously mixed  that my white ass has darker hair  than the actor who played the brother.  d
why not make something new  dont remember the last time i saw an original story
hey melonie  tomorrow is my birthday imma be 32 lol
are you indigenous  if not then it wasn t meant to represent you in the first place. the girl playing nani is hawaiian native and that needs to be good enough. indigenous people don t have a single set skin tone or set of features  it s only ever outsiders that like to speculate on indigenous peoples identities and looks. maybe you forgot but we got colonized and there are after effects to that. i don t know a single person my age  from my tribe that isn t at least 1 4 white. the main point is  if the indigenous hawaiian people have no problem with the casting  then neither should anyone else. there have been multiple indigenous hawaiian people that have spoken out against the hate that the casted actors are getting.
they are doing this on purpose
in that thumbnail  she looks lighter skinned  but not white to me. visually  i think she passes for racially ambiguous.
melonie i have a question for you since your christian why do you stick out your tongue and do the one eye symbolism when you represent g fuel
can we stop supporting disney
disney run outta ideas! as a massive fan of animation all the remake real life shit has no standard. look at the end of the day if this is gunna be made...who care! i love your channel but sometimes. actors actress are just that! all human. if you started to get cat s to start acting like whales then maybe...
is it bad of me to hear  a white-skinned actress!  !  in the same plane as  a black sheriff   !!   some of you may be too old to know that one  i know.
dang  it totally agree.  when aerial was being cast i just wanted her to be pretty and have red hair   i didnt care if it was fake red  nor did i care that she was black.   but nowadays i cant stand this woke stuff at all  and i am totally against it.and actors should look as the characters they portray.   the one playing nani might be good  but she doesnt really look like her   even though she is of hawaiian heritage.if the actress was black  asian  white  whatever and looked alot like the cartoon version  i would have liked it more.but i am loving how the woke mob is now against this casting of this actress.   while when we where doing it   we where racists  bigots and who knows what else.
this isn t the first time they bitched about  white washing . remember the live action remake of  aladdin  and the backlash about jasmine s actress

so changing non black to a black is something to cheer about but doing the opposite will get all the anger. why so double standard  if you can do that to the non black but can t do the other way round. something is wrong somewhere.would love to see anna taylor joy as princess tiana
yeah the jade girl is black  go figure they would want her to play nani
are you gonna watch demon slayers new season
where were these people when anne boleyn  an actual historical person and not a cartoon  was race swapped
while we re talking about  race inclusion  ...i feel we need to empower our minorities  so may i suggest  justin timberlake  as prez obama for his documentary.
not a problem  paint her black n problem solved
hypocrisy at its finest
it s hilarious at least lol
@melonie mac go boom  fr xd
i m still waiting for mulan to be remade as a white man.
nani ! !
atleast the outrage for race swapping is consistant
if race swapping is good then it can go both ways.
what was the backlash
@miss meme  i believe lauren chen made a video about it. they were saying that she wasn t dark enough to play jasmine
i still have to finish last season  i am a little behind
omae wa mou shindeiru.
where s all your decorations and shit
nah. it was always stupid to race swap characters. jessica alba completely ruined the character for me.
ariel is not a fish  look at her tail. don  t they teach people anything anymore look at a whale... look at a shark... see the difference in the tails
not a fan of race swapping for movie roles  but elves and ariel the mermaid ain t real. some people are looking really hard for a reason to be outraged.
as funny as i find this  i still think they should have casted to the character and not picked a white woman.
i d say  light  but white is a whole thing. this is an issue of colorism  which is gross. we shouldn t erase her ethnicity just because she s mixed  tho
this is that age old hypothetical that that the wokester race baiters said would never happen. let me explain quickly. do you think it s okay to change the race of an established fictional character  if your answer is anything but no. imagine now that the character was a p.o.c. that was changed to be a white person. the fact people are changing their tunes about race swapping not being problematic now that the actress is  too white   is the most delightful form of irony.
i can t  stand remakes .
reversal!!!!
i m sorry but the girl whos playing ariel looks like a fish  that s prob why they chose her.
great  more drama over something we don t even need
n o aceito  eu quero uma negra!chega de ficar contratando atriz q n parece em nada com o personagem  poderia ter contratado ela pra fazer a pequena sereia e colocado a atriz da pequena sereia pra ser a nani  n o meus amores
i think you re missing the point of people telling you to get over the issue of switching the race from white to non-white. i can t tell if it s intentional. it isn t just that a race is swapped  and it definitely isn t just that a race was swapped from non-white to white. i think you either did not do your due diligence before making this video or you are a shameless grifter.
race swapping is never okay and i m not alright with this either.
race swapping is bad in every instance
i don t care either way cause these live action remakes are so unnecessary  but the hypocrisy is strong with woke people.
nobody will ever be happy honestly
she looks like you
who cares. let people be. why is there always have to be static
i thought so too  we re both mixed though  just a different mix
@melonie mac go boom  you are twins separated at birth
but i thought race didn t matter wokies
so would you be ok if a non white actress play you in your biopic
love the cartoon series as a kid. live action of this is lame.
race washing is wrong weather it s black or white
this poor actress didn t realize that having european dna makes her less valuable.
woke activists ariel isn t real ok nani isn t real either
casted ! you americans make me laugh.  it s cast...just cast
stop race swapping stop it its wrong its bad its a mockery stop mocking us stop making fun of and instulting us we get ut you hate us just leave us alone stop it!
omg mel. stop this bs now. this was on your side that had the issue. not the other side
since genghis khan left a lasting genetically mark on his world tour  we europeans can proudly claim that we all are of mixed race. wewuzmongols
in the meantime 18000 dairy cows were blown up and burned alive in west texas and our food supply is purposely being destroyed ! everything else is meaningless distractions in my opinion  thanks melonie!
she is jewish on one side of the family. in hollywood that is all that matters.
since when are samoans considered black anyway  tan skin isn t black skin.
there s nothing wrong with arielle being black
lilo was black not white

you can lookyou can run but !you will naught find..metime...after tymes ....the...left woke democrat socialist  communist...theme song....
if she looked like me  sure. i m mixed lol
she s hawaiian not white lol do better
still not gonna fucking watch it lol
lol  mixed ancestry... aren t we all
even in the post you re sharing it says cast ....then you put casted
what does casted mean  casted is an incorrect past tense conjugation of the verb cast. it almost never appears in print or edited works of any kind.
i swear to god its not that fucking deep i promise you
so true  they want us fat and dumb so they re getting rid of our good food supply
no she was brown
@ryang  but not black
for real  people need to stop obsessing about race. most of us are mixed  we re all human regardless
@melonie mac go boom  exactly. that s my point. so many are so obsessed with this.  it s obnoxious.
i find it offensive when animals in movies are always played by humans. animals should be played by animals. also avatar was am offensive movie because they had humans playing blue aliens. also look at how racist simpsons is. they have white people playing yellow characters
ok
its all crap
to be fair  black folks hate when light-skinned black women are cast to play dark-skinned black women. storm comes to mind for example.
misleading title. she has a lighter skin tone  but she s not  white skinned.
first
yes  i m sure you speak for all black people. ffs
she s at least half white and has white skin  there s nothing misleading about that lol
