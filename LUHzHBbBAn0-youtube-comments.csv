rip norah vincent. i remember her prime time interview back in the day and i walked away feeling like  yeah  this lady gets it.  then  of course  she was promptly sidelined and no one said a peep about her until she passed. she gave us one of the most needed lessons that society couldn t gloss over  minimalize  and bury fast enough.
men don t want to be coddled  but appreciation goes a long way.i know that you appreciate men  melonie  that s just a message for any women who might wonder what men want in life.
that s ironic. because every video you see of woman actually trying the life of a man comes out with a new respect for the male side of the species
mindy kaling   stop mocking me! why are you doing this ! melonie mac   because it is easy and it does a lot of damage.
ironic considering there s a real life documentary of a woman who pretended to be a man and she found that being a woman was easier. in fact  i think she committed suicide as a result of it.
mindy thinks men have it easier yet kissed a man without his consent and threatened to fire people if they said anything and had no repercussions for it.
i remember when i was a young girl and i first learned what feminism was  in the modern context not the suffragette fight for voting . when i was told that feminism was claiming to want women to be treated the same as men  i was immediately repelled by this idea. my exact words were something like   why would i want to be treated the same as men  that would be a demotion . i was raised by a christian  conservative father and mother. i was given the same love and opportunities as my brothers  but i was not given the same physical burden as they did. i did not have to work with my dad  outside in the hot sun. i stayed inside in the a c and learned how to cook. i know  how oppressive! my father and brothers opened the door for me  let me sit down when there was not enough seats  and basically were chivalrous gentlemen. i don t want to be treated the way men treat other men  they can be kinda rough. my brothers would get into big fights for a while and it scared me. i don t want to be treated as equal to a man. i want to be treated better  like a woman.
everybody trusts and helps men  has to be the sickest joke ever created. people neither trust nor help men at all. people probably don t really trust women either  but they sure do get help
this quote came to mind    hard times create strong men. strong men create good times. good times create weak men. and  weak men create hard times.
as a man i gotta say we don t want to be put on a pedestal  but we do appreciate an acknowledgement once in awhile  a little bit of gratitude goes a very long way...edit  and that journalist who committed suicide did so because after publishing this story she was hunted down and persecuted by her former allies in feminism for being a  traitor rip
as a man  i don t care how hard it gets. everyone struggles with stuff and i ve been through plenty and i m still here because god has given me the strength to deal with anything  and protect those around me. i can t believe anyone would have the balls to question this about men at all  great job supporting that here mel!
i m so privileged that i was homeless for nearly 2 years.  haha. love the beanie look btw  it s mine and my lady s favourite get upalso  i saw that woman s story. it s crazy how it s not as popular as it should be.. bless that woman. people need to watch it and understand how us men matter and how we always did  just as much as women. probably one of the reasons why i don t believe in equality. it don t exist   in my opinion.
a woman literally self deleted after spending time undercover as a man and seeing how horrible men are treated. they clearly didn t learn anything from her and seem so stupid.
media and entertainment commentary with a spiritual point of view on matters. there are not enough journalists like you  melonie! keep it up!
men honoring their wives  or else not getting their prayers answered  is actually an extremely sweet thought.
you know they have a problem with the main character when there is a serial killer on the loose and somehow it seems to be a better person than velma.
i love your takes on the bible. as a judaeo christian it s refreshing to see people publicly acknowledging their faith .   great video
i can t comprehend how this show can be worse!  never underestimate how low these people will go with this show . and this episode just proves it.
best part of the norah interview is  when she talks about the true brotherhood she felt within her guy friendgroup...something she had never experienced as a woman with her woman friends.
this show just keeps on virtue signaling. they re even mocking the people who they re trying to attract. i also want to say from experience  it s definitely not easy to be a man. anyways  i love your hat  you look great today melonie!
may norah rest in peace.
i remember that docu. day 1   how hard can guys have it  really   a few weeks later   i have no idea how men cope living like this. no one even cares if they live or not!  rip norah. we lost an actual journalist.
@harbl99  as a guy no one cares at all.and second yes  we did lose an actual journalist.death should be sad no matter who it is.i don t bad mouth the dead even if they are my enemies or horrible people who committed terrible crimes.it s not my place judge.i hope i m making sense.if we felt sad like a family member dying  history would be less bloody  that s just a theory.
@sjent  poor norah.
i remember her interview and when asked if after the experience she gain more respect for man and she said she gain more sympathy.if a guy would make a experience of living was a woman and asked if he gain more respect for woman and he said he gain more sympathy   the feminist and all the establishment would cancel the guy to oblivion and no need to say he would receive tons of death treaths
r.i.p. norah
yeah  i remember that interview too.  it was... not enlightening  but...hmm... validating   i suppose   but yeah  it s sad to hear she felt that was her best option.  r.i.p.
this this exactly its all ive ever tried to explain to my family but its in one ear out the other to expect basic apperication and feeling hurt by the absolute lack of it is  being whinny and spoiled  if your a dude it seems even in family units.
@housewilma4904    @j hardman yep. appreciation. in the end  that s it. way back when  the ones people kept calling incels  even though incels were already proudly calling themselves incels  were guys who wanted to be appreciated by the ones  usually women  they were helping out and sticking by. those guys wanted a loving relationship  not to dip their wicks. but any guy that wants wanted respect  gratitude  appreciation  love  and so on   got disgustingly mocked so they stopped asking for such and went to any other side that  helped  them  even if it was worse groups like whatever those guys that trick others into sex called themselves. people think these bad groups spawn from nowhere  when most are a reaction to hurt and someone else offering a hand  even as a fake gesture  which the fake goodwill seems preferable to outright horrible treatment.
simple respect is the only thing that a real man need.
we re seldomly even appreciated unless we re earning money or accomplishing something in that moment lmao
a simple  thank you  goes a long way.
i remember one time a man wrote to me that advocating and sticking up for men wasn t my fight. sure  maybe it s not. i m not a man  but i don t have to be one to see how wrongly men are being treated and try to make a change. it isn t about pity  but about doing what is right.
appreciation does help but nowhere near enough. i ve suffered from mental health issues all my life and its taken a huge chunk of my life. this whole thing of men don t need help or have feeling is bull. men need help but help is never around when you need it. men need to talk and take their thought and feeling seriously otherwise we know where that road ends and it s not good. give us the help we need to continue being our best selfs.  not saying all men  every man is different. plus don t take away our masculinity. we ve all seen the far left and want they want men to be. let s say f that. most of the time appreciation is all that is needed and helps men with our their mental health. for those of us who have mental health or anything weighing on their minds  then help needs to be available asap. because if we aren t ok then our families aren t ok. the man of the house is a very important job and a hard one. but just to make it harder these woke nut jobs have been destroying men none stop since around 2016. why is being a man so wrong
@shaikanwolf8  dont listen to him. we men like to fight our own battles naturally. but we need advocacy just as much as women in times like these. appreciate you! i  for one  know men and women need each other to fight the war against traditional gender roles and the nuclear family. i do my best as a man to stand for women s rights over trans invasive tactics.
throughout human history man has been the ultimate pillar that s endured suffering  hardship   self sacrifice for the benefit of our species in the long run.
@mrvideogamebr  what   why do you think that   they d eat that up for a guy to admit they struggle enough to deserve sympathy after living like them.
most men are so starved of it even a little amount of appreciation is world changing
yeah wheres my privilege as a white male
@mgame1988  the ones who called themselves incels are either dudes who are depressed and accept that life is kind of nihilistic and that women won t ever be with them or the really insane dudes who idolize elliot rodgers and act edgy.at least as far i ever met and seen.
@chandllerburse737  the depressed ones starting to become even with the pick-up artist followers  but there were a lot more followers than depressed nihilists about 7-10 years ago. i don t know who elliot rodgers is though.
@mgame1988  man who claimed to be incel.rich mixed asian hated women and eventually killed a couple of people then himself.
@chandllerburse737  dang. but that sounds plausible for those who claim that label willingly. but my point was those who other people slap that label on without thinking. like any negative label.
@mgame1988  same for sjw and woke also used too much as a buzzword than when its actually appropriate it seems too common today for both sides to do thisalthough velma is not something i consider inapplicable for that label at all.
@chandllerburse737  the waters for any negative label get muddied hardcore.  wolf  witch  nyahtzee  communist  terrorist  istphobe.  i wonder what the next sociopolitical word will be.
@chandllerburse737  wat  we were discussing how and a bit of why.
@mgame1988  i just don t know if i want to go into hypotheticals
@chandllerburse737  ah. while i didn t go into hypotheticals  i might have mistaken that your question was being aggressive towards me.
@mgame1988  eh
or they kill themselves because the experience was too much for them.
as the cartoon cheetah says. it ain t easy  having testacleesee.
but nope  not velma  since she s blissfully ignorant of reality no matter what she tries. original  real  velma would be ashamed.
@ranmouri82  thats why i love that meme of original velma beach slaping the other one
lmfao i know that skit...   d backstabbing bruh
can t keep supporting you guys stop watching the show right now act like it doesn t exist i was watching megan that is better even though she s a i a what she didn t have fun with not equal rights it was not political it was under one condition protected the girl all cost she didn t rip his head off just cuz he was going to grow up to be a bad man no he was bad from beginning
man i love happy souls... i wanna watch it again.
yup  i mentioned that in the video too. sad story
@meloniemacgoboom  when did that happen
@cjgamer6356  she covers it at 5 08
@eadric3338  thanks
it s sad. she could have helped stop this madness that has enveloped the world. i get that she couldn t deal with what men go through on a day-to-day basis. it s also  sad she couldn t overcome what happened to her. i don t even remember the  news  covering her untimely passing.
try watching the video before commenting next time..
@meloniemacgoboom  my understanding was her suicide was mainly due to health problems but the living as a man thing certainly strongly contributed to her depression and mental health struggles.
men don t want to be coddled  we just want to be appreciated and respected.
thats really odd because why didn t she just stopped pretending to be a man
apparently she really did become a man.because men are the ones who succeed  at commit suicide the most in the society. i hope she rest in peace.
@chandllerburse737  she did the experiment was meant to last a year or two it lasted six months i believe.
@chandllerburse737  she did and then was haunted by the experience for over 10 years  can t remember the exact number  before calling it quits on life.she literally got ptsd from living as a man.
@thebattlegod  okay
guys she didnt commit suicide because of the experience  after the results of the experiment were opposite of the desired  the people around her bullied and ostracized her. they literally drove that woman to suicide because she changed her perspective. its honestly disgusting.
which she herself said on national tv.and  shocker  nothing happened to her
switch the roles and the man would still be imprisoned.
everyone should be treated fairly regardless of gender.
last two sentences come across weird
true  women are treated much better.
possibly one of the best straight to the point comments ive seen on these topics
@eggsecuter  i realize the way i said it was confusing. when i say  equal  i mean it the way feminist mean it as in treated the same. as if treating people differently is always a bad thing. i do not want to be treated the same as a man. i have seen the way men treat other men  and while it works for them  it is not for me. i have a different relationship dynamic with my brothers than they do with each other and i like it. i am more openly affectionate and they reciprocate with me. with each other it shows more in acts of service for each other.
@cantnevercould9660  yes i agree  and i am treated fairly. but fair is not what the modern concept of  equal  means. it means women must be treated exactly the same as men. and i don t want that. i still had to work to contribute to the house hold but it was not the exact same as my brothers. i feel like i got the better end of the deal.
amen sis! i was raised the same way. my dad past last year. he was a real man  sacrificial  chivalrous  and most of all  godly. i am so glad he taught me as your father taught your brothers. women are a gift from god  they are our life-bringers and deserve to be treated with respect. i know many won t agree  but  man was not meant to be alone. we needed a companion that balances us in all the best ways. real  godly women are a treasure.
welp won t be long til no one treats women like women
the fact the show makes a joke about  why should women be taught self defense instead of teaching men not to harm women   should prove that society doesn t inherently trust men.
other women have different views than you and one should accept that.many women enjoyed working being able to have the certain abilites that once in the past were only for men.if i am not wrong in biblical and medieval times women could not own land really many were pressured to marry and once married the man now owned it. arranged marriages and so on.over centuries and decades some women have wanted change and there was still much to change not too many decades ago. whether there is now or not i don t know really but its not a demotion to every women objectively to be on the same level as man.and many women many young girls want to work they want to do things men want and have to do. they don t enjoy cooking inside you do but thats you.
@chandllerburse737  yes  which is why my comment was only my experience and my opinion. although  even actual modern feminists do not want to be treated exactly the same as men  because they dont want the disadvantages that men face. they only want the opportunities. not the responsibility. men still are most of the homeless  most of the people in prisons  most of the people who commit suicides  and most of the people who die in wars. but that is not the  equality  that modern feminists demand.i am all for women having rights  i think that was a great win. however  i dont want to do what a man does. its not that glamorous to work for somebody else until i die.
@sherlock7898  as a man the statistics on issues men face is not unknown to me.everyone has problems some are less severe than others but playing a victim game is dumb however problems should still be addressed if they are there for either sides.and shouldn t be invalidated.this is why i don t like peoplewho discount blackpill men as deserving and they shouldn t get help.  albeit ive spoken and argued with so many of them some of them i admit pissed me off so royally i kind of end up just being angry but thats probably because of my own issues anyways still not exactly an excuse or the other way around where people act as if a woman being raped isn t as bad as loneliness apparently thats a thing or that its a womans fault because she wore skimpy clothes or whatever the stupid hell people come up with.everyone has issues.our species if anything is nearly one big issue it feels sometimes we just have to keep trying to do better and maybe we will maybe but even then i have depression so i don t always feel that way.
@droscoaz  not every woman is a good person. amber heard  for example.
@chandllerburse737  yes thats kind of my stance on things too. i don t like to say whether men or women have had it worse because we both have had a pretty bad things happen to us. and even then the experience changes from person to person. if a woman wants to work  then it doesn t much bother me. i am actually studying to get a job as a teacher so i am going to work. my point was more  that chivalry leads to women being treated better not worse. that sometimes it is not a bad thing that men and women are not treated exactly the same.
@sherlock7898  chivalry is dependent on the person.and even then i mean for some women chivalry may extend as far as just having a door held open for them i believe.
@chandllerburse737  women should be able to work but currently they are not under any standards picking up the slack left over by men and nor are they maintaining the stability of the economy. i don t think women shouldn t work but our society gives them too much in unaccountability and the lowering of standards which reduces competency and value
i agree  don t need to be praised or anything it s dumb. i m not a scientist who made a discovery or any other worthy of praise.
@splittingofprides  same here  i m a whole garbage every now and then but that doesn t mean i want to be treated like garbage.
@greenhat8978  i treat myself like garbage
we don t need any of it  but a compliment from a woman will still brighten our days greatly.
how tolerant of them.
my male privileged has not in 25 years. i don t have that  i need to go male privileged to mechanic shop to get mine fixed.
did some people forget just one of the  guys i remember it she went undercover for a story. she can get one for the newspaper editor turns out it became something more than that she actually found someone in a relationship that she could be with even though she was pretending to be a guy and she s the man woman can t play sports as in soccer made them all look stupid when she proved them wrong this now is just been forced it s not genuine
velma is supposed to be an indian girl here.two things  most of them are beautiful. and the ones that are not are the most considerate. and velma portrays all of them as ugly  both inside and out. mindy kaling  and her velma  are more californian than indian. more white than brown. there s slurs in asia for that kind of behaviour and fakery and forgetting boasting about your roots as per your convenience.
woman seem to be bad at tearing each other bound and fighting with friends.
everyone trusts and helps men  lol  literally the opposite of the truth.
this could easily be one of mystery incorporated episodes where mindy kaling would be the antagonist to be busted and unmasked by scooby doo and his friends for impersonating them with her gang of cronies in an attempt to ruin their reputations in crystal cove.
even though this was disproven a while back by a woman who dressed like a man and found out how awful it actually is.
that s a sad story about vincent. we need more good masculine man in this world not less. i hope you re having a good day melonie.
kaling is insane. she s lost it. she s gone  real gone.
more than 33 years i ve been with my wife  and it is all because we work as a team.  you are 100  right kiddo.
glad your channel is growing fast  voices like yours are needed. this world is so crazy
if mindy kaling wanted to write her self-insert fic so badly  she should have gone to wattpad.
disparu is great . his writing and delivery.
mindy kialing needs therapy. she clearly hates herself. like really has issues.
i don t have words melonie thanks for another great video!
husbands  love your wives.  wives  respect your husbands. even in old testament times  they understood that for a marriage to work all of a mans actions has to be based on love for his woman   all a woman s actions has to be based on respect for her man.
i knew she was being herself in the office.
they manage to cram all the woke talking points in one show  that s a feat...
lets have a moment of silence for disparu and his service to the world. does do some good breakdowns of shows i really don t want to see for myself but will more than happily listen to someone else s commentary of the situation
i still can t even watch more than the first 20 minutes of ep 1 you are brave
one way it s more difficult for men  is in the dating pool. most women wait for the guy to make the move  which unfortunately for guys like me  it s too much of a risk to put what seems like a nice or good friendship on the line to find out if that person likes them the same way. i ve had many good friendships with women end because they weren t interested in me the same way. as for the velma show. comicstorian put it best  all the hate on the show is just free advertising for them. people post how bad the show is  which cause people to want to check it out and see for themselves  which then gives the show more ratings resulting in the show being  a success   hence why it s getting a season two . looking back at it  that s how 50 shades of grey became successful. everyone was saying how the book was one of the worst  which caused people to go out and get the book to see for themselves  which then made it on the best sellers list and got a movie or two. compare that to something like young justice where people watched it  enjoyed it  but weren t vocal about it. thus not advertising it  causing it to not get as many views and. get caused for a second or third time. part of it goes to the marketing team that did not promote the show  but also the fan base that. also because humans seem to love a good drama and we are drawn to drama  like a moth to a flame. like if you were to post a video with the title being that you were praising something or someone for being or doing a good job  it would most definitely get at most only half the views a video like this gets. it s something mmprtoys noticed with their vlog videos
i hate when women say how easy mens live are and just trash talks us all the time saying  men are trash  yes i get it i am not wanted or loved and have to go through hardship and extreme loneliness because it s my job to. man life sucks and not worth living. i ve tried to contribute to those un alive   numbers but turns out i can t even do that go figure.
i ve always just viewed the difficulties as different. stronger back  heavier burden. and conversely  i d be poorly suited for the duties that women should fill. complementarianism is key  and i was glad to hear you mention that at the end.
not trying to sound like a  simp  but i love melonie s style... she always wears the cutest outfits... i dig it.  every video she makes  i m like  yooo she looks adorable  that outfit is the bomb
yup i talked about that in this video too
and who was promptly witch hunted into suicide by her former allies.
she s just like any other typical misandrist.
it s only a matter of time before she loses everything and becomes another panhandler we pass on our way to work everyday.
nah she s just another karen
@christopherloyd8938  yeah and didn t she threaten to get a white man fired
always was.
thank you so much  that really means a lot
the sad part is she already had a terrible show about herself with her name in the title. it was so bad that i m not surprised you may not have heard of it. she already got a self insert series.
thank you
don t fall for the hate watching lie  it got signed on for a second season before the first episode even aired. people checked out the first two episodes and ditched it in disgust but the network has to find a way to spin it. fifty shades got popular because of one demographic  lonely house wives. one and a half demographics  lonely housewives and light bdsm fans.
it s extremely refreshing to have a youtuber that s down to earth  not afraid to speak the truth  and godly. keep doing what you re doing! subbed and notifications on!!
thank you for your thoughts about men toward the end of the video. just thinking about the amount of pressure that is put on men most days is exhausting let alone actually following through with it. if men buckle under pressure or  god forbid  ask for help  they are seen as weak  insecure  and or inferior so it is stuffed down deep inside until it eventually erodes away mentally. men don t want to be treated like babies  but being empathically aware of the burden goes a long way. it s refreshing to know that there are women out there that understand this perspective.
great video!  as usual. disparu is a trooper for watching these and keeping  relatively  sane.  i love his stuff too.  the cringy turns hilarious thanks to his snarky commentary.  priceless stuff.   he makes the intolerable enjoyable.  i m sorry that ms. vincent chose to unalive herself  but i appreciate her experiences living as a man and telling the story of the truth of the experience.  in a society that has no problems telling me  and who have taken pains to tell me  that i m responsible for everything bad that has ever happened and i m no good for anything because of what other people who were not me but who shared some physical characteristics with me did  sometimes the urge to become unalive is even stronger than normal.  i hate that this is the bigotry that is not just accepted but is actively encouraged in today s society.  as if i wasn t already struggling desperately with despondency and depression  along will come another holier-than-thou ignoramus who  though they know nothing about me or my situation  will tell me how lucky i am to be so well off and privileged. keep up the good work  melonie.  you help me stay hopeful.
disparu is the man with the will power to save us from the horror...
life as a man is neverending competition against other men  even your friends.
you re right  men don t have it as easy as society would have us think. there s a lot more pressure on us  that we never seem to talk about  than we all seem to realize. now we re being put down more and being told to act a certain way that is completely out of our design  regardless of personality  and our society is facing the repressions of it. we re just being brainwashed to see differently. there is such a thing as toxic masculinity  but true and genuine masculinity is not toxic.
sorry didn t watch the vid  but came to thankyou. you sharing your faith here and there through videos and tweets and whatnot has helped me re-find my own.keep doing your thing and god bless.
great video! what men need is men only spaces that don t get ridiculed and or infiltrated by women  spaces where we can be ourselves  be accountable to each other and have each others backs. i remember when i used to box as a kid having role models and working hard  those are some of the best memories i have.
velma just does not exist to me. my soul can t handle this being an actual show
mindy kaling really has some serious psychological issues to work out and there isn t a shrink qualified enough to deal with her hot mess.tfs alucard   but i am!
the quicker this show ends the better for us all
you make some great points here. it is hard to be a real man in this world but the rewards are also very great. to provide and protect a woman is a great feeling. we all need to aspire to do what god created us to do.
i remember watching a social experiment a number of years ago  where a man pretended to be aggressive and towards his  girlfriend . people stopped to intervene. they then reversed it and ppl walked by laughing. one woman shakes her fists in delight. she was interviewed and said   he probably deserved it . but yea ppl help men more than women
none of us know objectively who has it worse  down to an individual level too. i m sure someone in my body would have a harder or easier time than i do due to their own perspective etc. it s a tough world  we should be supporting each other instead of all this shit also damn you look excellent in that hat somehow  well played.
in my opinion  it s like they try to limit  how  manly  you can be. how strong you can be. instead  it should be about  how strong do you have to be  to survide  so  what has to happen to get support  they want to make the strong men weak  instead of supporting the men with problems. and yes  that hurts men. attacking the top instead of supporting the bottom. limiting men instead of encouraging and supporting them. that s what they do  to  help  men.  help  men to be less  so they have it  easier . instead of help men  so they can be more. totally stupid. it has nothing to do with logic  and nothing to do with anything good. that s the perversion of help. but that s all of this ideology. a treacherous perversion of good things  principles  values and believes. and this corruption  abomination  that describes exactly  why you could call it  satanic
didn t expect it to get so dark. personally  i don t think its that easy to say who has it harder. because again  individuals are individuals. and i m so over  comparing  game. unless its something you aspire to be  comparing yourself to anyone or any group is  usually  negative and not very productive.thanks to melonie for shedding light on a story that...i don t think most people would cover are aware off.to add to her point about men s instinct to protect  i think that s been used against men enough by now that its going away. we ve seen it on the street  where everyone plays the  waiting game  for someone else to make step up or everyone just keeps on walking. and off late the whole  gym  fiasco.at the end of the day  it doesn t matter if someone likes it or not  men and women need each other. and no  i do not mean in just the  romantic sexual companionship  aspect. because surprise  there s a lot more that we  humans  men and women  are worth than just a bang!
i wasn t aware that norah had taken that route  and it s all too typical that her findings about how us men live and the crap we re fully expected to endure every day of our lives were buried and marginalized the way they were. i mean  really  heaven forbid that she tell the truth  right ! more power to her and rip. you also are spot on about  male feminist  types  miss melonie  based on my past personal experiences around them and on what i see all the time online and otherwise  they re some of the most vile  untrustworthy excuses for humanity i ve seen in my life  and are masters of projecting their own negative traits onto the rest of us and hiding behind the wall of privilege their claimed views to avoid getting called on it. sue me  but it s true. you rock the beanie look  by the by  miss melonie!
hey melonie. i like the beanie look. and yeah velma is horrible.
sad truth is that men are expected to just shut up and work for the rest of their lives if they vent their frustrations or show emotions they are castrated for it call it toxic masculinity or whatever but its what society expected them to be
this is the content of mindy kaling s character
look i don t like the show or mindy kaling but she s not the only one involved. the showrunner  charlie grandy  should be put on the stand too and unless you re a qualified psychologist  i don t think you re allowed to judge what psychological problems a person has  just saying
stop   simping
is this melonie s way of telling us she s dating tim poole   lol
@smurfie8412  you do realize stephen is both a mod and friend of melonie s  right  he s not simping. it s called being a supportive friend.
men lean into challenges and don t need pity parties. the lack of mutual respect does grate on occasion. that said  i m still holding the damn door whether you deserve it or not lol
love your channel melonie! keep it up  and have a great day! also  great toque!
i honestly didn t think it could get any worse
ahmen sista!! men and women do make a pretty dandy team  sadly  there are absolutely a lot of people that are losing that and it s really sad. not to mention it makes it extremely difficult to find someone decent to spend your life with too.
i don t even have hbo.  i m so happy to not even waste my time with this.
we don t want to be coddled. we just want respect
melonie for me you are spot on.there should be more people like you.i love your take on life.god speed !!!
i remember singing   it takes a woman  from hello dolly.  certain things men are good at and other things women are good at.  love the video
it s nice that mindy pays homage to her brother.
i m sure disparu will become the akuma of youtube   he wears a very specific outfit so you know it s dark disparu.velma pole danced her dad so yeah   mindy khaling is clearly out of her mind
what a train wreck this has become! this is the gift that keeps on giving!
since the rest has already been said  in previous comments  i ll add...being self-absorbed requires self-awareness. i highly doubt mindy  or the writers  have any self awareness  they re too obsessed with their next target s  to be offended by.
based  for anyone in general they should try to be self sufficient as they can but also we should have a healthy support group to be around. not a safe space where everyone agrees 100  of the time but people who can help comfort you but also call you   challenge you to be better.
yeah disparu is great. so much of his humor has me dying laughing. great content. and so much more entertaining than the actual show.
with great power comes great responsibility
oh yes  and i bet velma totally has some kind of issue in the episode  like her totally realistic ptsd  while donning her disguise and everybody hurries to her rescue and not tell her to  man up .
i m trying to keep up with the woke trends  that was funny
you melonie mac are an incredibly resourceful lady  and as a man i thank you for that. i love your insights too.keep doing the great work  melonie mac! go boom!
i watched all 8 of them and yes i regret it   calling it garbage or a dumpster fire is a complement.only way i was able to actually watch all 8 episode was to completely ignore mind... velma i mean velma in the show and i didn t even do it consciously  my brain just couldn t watch her so it just tuned her out which i don t even understand how tf it happened
let s appreciate that melonie and other youtubers like nuxanor suffer so the rest of us don t have to.i see it from your and others  perspectives and i have to ask who is this for  we didn t ask for the entire scooby-doo gang to be like this and last i checked nobody did.
american dad had an episode where haley works at a strip club and has a scene of both stan and francine watching her  giving her money. hollywood is out of it s mind  not just mindy.
it was too cringe for me and my buddies to watch over discord  it s not even good as it s own show let alone a take on the scooby-doo story.
@melonie  have you considered doing a video discussing comedy and the problems of  female driven  comedy i have some theories of my own of why female comedians are kind of struggling  barring a few good exceptions   but it would be interesting to hear your perspective as well.
me and the boys  i don t care. this show is like ubisoft making good games  it doesn t happen anymore.
not to sidetrack from the topic but this is easily the hottest outfit she s ever worn.
mindy can still save herself if she claims her show was made intentionally awful for the purpose of uniting all sides in these trying times
i d have written a scene where someone just states that they figured out she was dressed in drag and just didn t want to be bothered with calling her out
mel is spot on  on her take of the  base  male female dynamics.
all i can say is melonie only real woman such as yourself know the truth!thanks for speaking facts 100 !
i don t see how anyone can put up with this and remain sane. disparu we salute you!!!!
yeah  the more i hear about this show  i think i m actually turning into a real life hulk.anyway that silly comment aside you brought up a lot great points in this video.  i especially liked the last past  i won t spoil it here for those who haven t seen it yet  i like that a lot!!!
velma   there s a serial killer on the lose  but i  velma  the real  brains  behind the mystery machine is gonna spend the entire season  bashing men  body shaming men and women  being a racist  falsely accusing people of crimes based on their race and gender  being delusional about why my mother abandoned us  not respecting my father because he won t share my delusions  treating my one friend like a dog when they re the only one who s nice to me  then being jealous when they move on to a different person  play around with a girl i used to be friends with but i now hate because she s hotter than me  and on and on and on.the only thing indian about velma is that her mom s name is diya. other than that  this show portrays women as bigger monsters than men and even worse than serial killers.
just want to say norah did not kill herself due to her experience as a man  she died years after but she did talk extensively about how men had it rough so that is true
i m so glad you mentioned the bible and the roles men and women have. i see so many feminists crying about their  forced roles  and when i went and read the bible and looked at the old testaments  men had more rules to follow than women do  tbh. they have more of a responsibility. and when i see them saying that  i just want to yell at them   bro  did you see how long that paragraph god s rules for men were    it covered almost half a page  lol. that s not to say we don t have our own roles as women  either. god lists them throughout the bible  repeats them  honestly  and women like ruth  ester  mary  etc. are prime examples of godly women and how he wants us to be. its like they read one single verse and thinks thats all there is to it. like no lol.  that is the same as taking the book lord of the rings and picking out one random sentence and claiming its trash just based off that one line with no other context. its ridiculous and shows a lack of comprehension  in general.
it s a shame to hear that about norah  i remember seeing some of her documentary and appreciating her humble and understanding evaluation.
melonie with a beanie looks adorable but different. she reminds me of a character i just can t put my finger on it.
mindy kaling is some kind of genius.creating a show that s so universally hated  and to such a degree that everyone watches talks about it its incredible. all be it outrageously bad  it can t be denied that the show is a viral success.
awesome content melonie keep it up
imo it s ok to be a man  because you sometimes get a lot back. especially from good women  and emotional. they understand  and you can trust. it gives strength. having such a relationship enables huge potential. it s one of the things you really have to experience  before you can understand it. sadly a lot of people never experience it. because it s a commitment  too. and we know  how some women are. but it can be good. protecting someone  being able to make her feel secure. changing her life. and suddenly a lot of things are possible. but together. yes  as team  100 . especially if you had to go through a lot  you can get a lot back. some people just survived because they found someone. and it gave them strength. especially after things like war and losing friends. for example my grandma s dad after ww1 in germany. so i am fine with that  but imo what s important  is respect. in general. society. and imo it needs more to support the men at the bottom of society. it doesn t need limits for the top. it doesn t need something like protection from doing too much. from being too manly. but support  if it is too much. but what they do  is the opposite  limit strong men. punish them. while ignoring men who suffer. or mocking them because they suffer. this ideology  the people that follow them  they are hypocrits. and male feminists are jealous  most of the time. they want to destroy  what they don t have  because that s easier than earning that. they can t be successful  so they destroy others success. they can t have good women and relationships  so they try to destroy marriage  encourage cheating  hate pretty women. it s disgusting and obvious. and kind of sad and pathetic. and no surprise  that men like that are some of the worst men in our society
velma  everybody just accepts what she says and barely pushes back. the main cast falls for her.velma as a man  everybody just accepts what she says and everything she does is great.fred  a real man in the show   is arrested without any evidence and gets shot in both knees instead of the person tresspassing. get s made fun of for having a small dick  being born to rich parents and being an idiot. get s thrown into jail on no basis at all in the most rigged and unprofesional trial in history.norville  another man   is made fun off when he confesses his feelings.yeah men definitely are priviledged and taken seriously. just look at all the evidence the show itself provides. men are the constant laughing stock for things they can t control  while velma faces no consequences despite being the most unlikable and abrasive person in the show. people even fall for her despite her only being rude to them all the time.
a woman that actually appreciates men
good video  good message. keep it up mate.
i agree  i just can t feel anything about it.
@splittingofprides  yep.for velma  shitshow.for ubisoft  i rather share a quote...  a business that makes nothing but money is a poor business . - henry ford. plus... ubisoft is the definition of insanity!
i think avatar frontiers of pandora and the star wars open world game they have planned will be good  and also beyond good and evil 2 when it finally releases. ubisoft isn t completely gone yet.
@shadowman4454  yeah until... they make another ac game far cry game.plus...   a business that makes nothing but money is a poor business . - henry ford.
agreed. competition is healthy. but its gone too far to that point that all interaction is judged from a competitive antagonistic lens. its idiotic. we were created to compliment each other  not compete for the entirety of our existence. it would drive everyone insane  and it is  evidently.
i still think it was a troll fanfiction. there s no way she didn t know what she was doing. she wanted to spite the audience and gain popularity by hate watching because she doesn t know any other way to make a successful show.
i love the last point you made    and i m glad you highlighted that too. the church  when it lives correctly  and biblically   values the role and ministry of women. look at romans 16 alone and there are many believers listed by name and a significant number of them are women    the ot also has its examples e.g deborah in the book of judgeskeep up the great work  melonie mac! go boom!
mindy forgot that everyone in the town was already worshipping minma and hanging on her every word  despite the fact she s a high school freshman  including the mayor and police. everyone was in love with her despite her being a manipulative jerk. mindy just forgot. she also forgot the disadvantages her show demonstrates the men in the show are at. so show manages to contradict itself very very easily.nora vincent found out the truth. unfortunately it was at men s support groups where she get the most damage.
there are some chuckles to be had... i liked when they ripped off the mustache and she goes  aaah that was my actual mustache i just didn t shave it!  i did laugh at a few things but it reminds me of what  the boys  would be if it had shit acting and was a cartoon. it has some little crumbs for the other side but the rest is so absurdly woke. the thing that i think makes velma even watchable without putting a drill in my brain is that said woke characters have flaws and say they have flaws. it isn t peak woke because that would be like captain marvel where she is just this perfect angelic force... hope that makes sense  p
velma   writers   really thought this   show   would be the new south park.
rest in peace norah vincent  so sad.
honestly never heard of or seen your channel  was just randomly in my feed and i clicked. 9 minutes of your talking and content and yep  now i m subscribed. thanks for the vid!
no way in hell a man can get away with acting like this velma. he would get beat down in a alley within a hour.
i really don t understand this weird  grass is greener on the other side  mentality some people have about the opposite sex. the sexes are supposed to be working together  not working against one another. like you said  it s a team  it s not a competition.
imagine if melonie wears a trucker hat like android 13 from dragon ball z.
im pretty sure nora vincent also had mental health  and possibly physical health issues that compounded things  pushing her toward seeking that end.tragic for sure  makes you wonder if something could have helped  something early in life maybe  idk
thank you mindy khaling  for helping me recognize my male privilege.
i wish i lived a life of privilege and ease
this legitimately infuriates me. i really hope mindy kaling fails at everything she ever does and fades into obscurity.
where is this privilege i m accused of having  lol when i m sad or upset we don t have helping hands to make us feel better. people just tell us to man up and deal with it.
out of sight  out of mind is my motto. if it looks like trash  don t watch it. then you won t be disappointed that you watched it. i am older now but if i had the urge to watch scooby doo again. i will watch the originals. oh gawd i remember having a scooby doo lunch box that i took to school lol. oh lordy.
my wife asked me a while ago   would you ever remarry if anything happened to me   she said she wouldn t want me to be alone  aww...yea aint she s sweet . my reply was a resounding  hell no   i got lucky once  the odds are against me. this world is a mess. i don t need someone else s money. i don t need anyone to cook. laundry is easy. i don t need kids  done that. i don t need companionship  i already have grown kids to bug and i ll get a dog . just too much anger towards men and way too much toxic feminism going around. i don t need to be getting into arguments with someone every day over putting the seat down when they refuse to raise it for me. lol
there was a woman who tried this irl and killed herself a few years later. the experience caused her to have a deep depression.
well  maybe the creator of velma needs to take a real hard look at her thoughts and feelings about what she is putting out instead of pointing her finger by adding negative emotional fuel to the fire!!!
i tend to hold doors for people behind me.  now andvtgen women will get their back and say they can do it themselves.  haven t had a man yet say more than thank you.
man these comments encourage nihilism sometimes
i m a man  and i can guarantee that the average man s life is not easy  mindy. unlike average women  we men don t occasionally get free stuff from the opposite sex.
melonie  did you see those 2 videos from a while ago  2006ish   one was from a female  comedian  that tried to do stand-up as while dressed as a guy and still bombed  and ends the video crying to her supportive boyfriend. oh  i didn t even realize that was the same person from your article until i looked up the video. it was norah vincent.then there was a lesbian reporter that went undercover as a man for 18 months. she says she went in to see how things were from the male perspective  but that seems like pr spin after the fact. whatever her original intentions  she came out on the other side she concluding that   men are suffering. they have different problems than women have  but they don t have it better.
i just want to be valued instead of being used as a pawn
i like the hat. melonie looks ready for a rap battle.
i m getting 90 s look vibe  mel looks nice
my theory is along the lines of this  we as a society or whatever whoever rate success in money and position. and at the top it s mostly men. i just think we should redefine  success . remember the great words   behind every king is a queen  . team effort.
bahahah  velma is just so bad. i only know what s going on due to disparu  too. you look amazing melonie. have a great day.
don t feel like being angry
i think i disagree on the blanket statement of one side having it easier than the other. i think it depends on the topic  aspect  event  etc. some things men are better at  some things women are better at. but that point comes into what you mentioned with regards to the bible. men and women compliment each other. i think other religions and whole philosophical schools go into that. when both work together  appreciating each other s strengths and supporting each other s weaknesses  they ve been pretty successful. it doesn t even always have to be husband wife or other form of romantic couple. siblings  a brother and sister working together to accomplish a great goal or solve a difficult problem. father and daughter mother and son  along with the differences in viewpoint from age and experience  there are blind spots the parent or child might catch and help with gender aspects.
i remember her interview and when asked if after the experience she gain more respect for man and she said she gain more sympathy.if a guy would make a experience of living was a woman and asked if he gain more respect for woman and he said he gain more sympathy   the feminist and all the establishment would cancel the guy to oblivion and no need to say he would receive tons of death treaths
honestly i hope they make 10 seasons of this. the content we get from it is amazing. also they should ask the lesbian who went undercover as a guy for like a year  and then killed herself because of how bad women treated her
protect melonie at all cost.
as asian man. we are the least problematic. we just go about our business.
i love your message!  the lord wanted us to have our places  thats why i don t cook.
welcome to the beanie side  mel. suits you
speaking from 20 years  and counting  of solitary confinement  yeah  men have it a lot more difficult in this existence.
men go where we are needed  not merely wanted. if a woman is so sure she can hold up the entire sky herself  if she s so convinced that she has everything handled in her life  what place is there for a man within it  this is why the  boss babe  or  girlboss mentality ends up falling flat over time. if you want a stable  loving relationship  it is incumbent upon you to develop the skill set to be a partner in a marriage as well as embrace the humility of knowing you cannot do everything yourself. men also have to learn this as they grow up  and usually we do  as the most hard-headed among us rarely get anywhere long term because we push too many people away through our arrogance. men and women are designed to fit together in a traditional relationship. what he lacks  she covers  and vice versa  and the two together are vastly stronger than the sum of their parts. this requires sacrifice and a taming of ego to work on both ends.
one thing i learned as a single white man with no kids back in my late 20 s when i was struggling hard... we don t get help. ebt  i got 21 bucks a month. no rent assistance programs  utility help programs  no gov welfare aid at all. and the reason always returned that i simply didn t need it because i had no kids  no wife and i was a man.
thank you mel. god bless you
i m still wondering when i can get any of this privilege.
and disparu. that man s got mental strength of a fortress.
thank you! i used to wear beanies all the time but when i had to cut the damage off my hair and go short it looked terrible because my hair is so poofy  but now that it is growing out i m so stoked i can wear beanies again haha!
that s a tomb raider look if i ve ever seen one  melonie  goes hard
i remember my ex fiance telling me she didnt need or want me to protect her and her son. she also comes from money and thinks only government should have firearms. i feel so bad for her son.
and this show is somehow confirmed for a second season..
can t believe that actual ppl are keeping up with this show.
disparu might don t had a gun  but he is a soldier fighting on the frontline.i may not a man but seeing my father  my brother  and even my husband is enough to tell that being a man means a lot of responsibility that they had to be a reliable individual for their family. i am so proud of men in my family. and also it doesn t mean that being men are all strong brute force masculinity  they are also fragile people. so for me these people who viewed men like monsters maybe had dark past that they never able to get over with like being cheated or abused by men in their life or having a bad family. that s the only thing i could think of why do they became like that and mindy might be had a lot of saltiness towards men  white men specifically . but hey didn t she brag that she assulted a man
mindy is right about our privilege.  i ve have never been happier to be more likely to die at work so i don t have to hear about all this sh!t anymore.
completely forgot this show existed
well  that is a huge kick to the butt. your prayers will not get answered if you do not take care of your wife. well  i am not married  but it is very understandable for the reason why. well to all that are married. i hope you all succeed  and have a wonderful life..
oh yeah  much easier living as a man. mindy is welcome to join me for my next 350ft tower climb with 50 pounds of gear. easy!
ah yes  the male privilege of having to shell out  500 for a suit to wear to work instead of  50 for a dress
i have my male privilige to work overtime and search death in a boxing gym afterwards. lets go boys!
didn t know she... just heard it from tou.rest in peace.
hbo going to have to apologize for this one
through and through... peak  materialyou are  you have.
and yet  in the dating scene  when us men are taking our passports and leaving the country  women go on tiktok and cry about it.
gotta love their absurd hypothetical like it validates something when the reality s already been proven repeatedly to be the exact opposite
i guess one thing that has come out of women passing as men is that some of them are able to report about what s it s like to be an average guy.
you move up or down the hierarchy depending on if you agree or disagree with them.
beanie game strong melonie
oh yikes  that is a terrible thing to say to a man! and she s wrong  she does need men and doesn t realize it. these types of feminists will say they don t need a man yet submit to their boss at work who only sees her as a disposable employee and not bat an eye
@meloniemacgoboom  normally you would be right  but she is a badass at work  we work together but i m changing fields  shes just too stuck on government and thinks the police will save her.
the government does not have firearms did she word it that wrong  lol
@chandllerburse737  what do you mean  government not only has firearms  but access to firearms that normal everyday citizens have no access to.and her words were  only police and government should have guns
@chandllerburse737  not sure why you would go to that extreme as if people are advocating for nukes to be handed to everyone. perhaps you should look into it  unless you d really like me to tell you.
@actualdrunkatheist  i mean i was mostly joking.but i don t know the view on nukes or whats best.japan supposedly wants them gone but even they are under nuclear protection unopposed
@chandllerburse737  well unfortunately quite a few of her family members accused me of claiming just that. as far as nukes  who the hell really knows. nuclear power itself is wonderful  and no matter what people will always find ways to kill each other.
@actualdrunkatheist  nuclear power isn t the same as nuclear weaponry necessarily.
that s it  i m starting to think this show is a clever parody of the postmodern world.
now i know why i watch a lot of anime
0 18 norah vincent we needed you now more than ever...
corinthians 16 13  be watchful  stand firm in the faith  act like men  be strong.
disparu...not all heroes were capes
every one must have realized it was a costume. as a man  i do not even approach females unless they work some where and are in uniform- while i am in that workplace  asking questions about that place. that s how many times i have been discarded as trash for even simply attempting to ask a question i need an answer to  to females that have determined i exist to try and acquire them. and if a woman approaches me  to ask more than work related questions  or directions because she is lost  it might as well be an asteroid reactor meltdown level of sirens that go off in my head now.
rip disparu s vision he was a hero so we didn t have to watch it.
season 2 is also gonna suffer the same fate
disparu is a beast.
nice beanie  melonie
melonie just have to say your outfit looks great in this episode not trying to be creepy sorry if it is
dispauru is a mega troop doin service. my brother has always been watching it and after one episode he collapsed. so  i do believe  that velma is dangers.
holy shit i feel like i saw norah video like a couple years ago and it s sad to hear about that from a velma video.
this show is designed to make wokeism look terrible.  in all fairness  that s not hard to do. in fact  it s so easy a caveman  i mean   caveperson  can do it. and just think  there s going to be a season 2
mel looking like a cutie
just me personally  but men don t want to be coddled  we just want mutual understanding  transparency  and respect treat others how you want to be treated and don t treat everything like a game
as a male  i dont think people need to coddle men. i think the best medium of the two extremes is to understand men dont have it easy  and to encourage the right male behaviors. i dont want you to feel sorry for me  and i dont want to be more feminine. i would like it if you just told me what you do like  and then i will do that behavior more. i will still be the hunter  protector  and work hard to bring  bread  home to the family  but i need a partner that accepts those things i do  thanks me for them  and finds other tasks that help the  family . i look at a relationship as a team. you do work  i do work  and we both reep the combined benefits. i want my partner to also show the same work habits and ethic  because for men respect is everything.
thank you for your service disparu
velma is such a tragic and offensive show i swear to god. i can t help but think that this whole show is satire.
i fuckin love this woman.
amen! love that verse  as well as the book of joshua in general. it s my fav book because joshua was such a strong and masculine man of god!
masculinity created this world whether its threw an inventive mind or the muscle to put it into practice
both men and women have responsibilities and expectations that are very important to life and society. some are more important than others depending on the time and events of the world. but since all are necessary for life to continue there really is no point in trying to debate which is more important than the other.
every one is nice to men
you can just tell that the woke community is just falling apart  because  its changing way too much. it would be funny if the people who are leading it  are trying to put everything back to normal  because they even think this is stupid at this point.
after the first clip she  nut taps  the sheriff i haven t had that happen to me since high school and it was no tap
one thing i find annoying about modren day feminists. is they seem to think they know how it feels to be a man. then when confronted with the reality of being a man. they either ignore or go into denial of the truth.
the simplest phrase i have heard about men and women in one perspective.  women are born valuable  men must become valuable
i m likin the beanie melonie and i agree. disparus videos are awesome!
male support system is called a bar or possibly a gym. it used to be a garage but new cars are impossible to work on.
please tell me about that privilege that i have not experienced yet.
it would be more accurate to say that men are only visible for what they bring  that is  skills  achievement  financial status  what have you  while women are visible simply for being women. i once heard someone put it succinctly that a woman is a human being  that is  she only has to be to have intrinsic value  while a man is a human doing  that is  he only has worth for what he can do. a great deal is made out of international men s day being the same day as world toilet day but i ve always thought it was appropriate  they both take crap from buttholes all day long and are only ever noticed when they stop working.i cleaned that up a little .
i think i heard something about this garbage fire show getting a 2nd season last week. keep up the good work  melonie. so much woke garbage lately you ll never run out of things to call out  lol.
has  velma  brought up gamergate yet
how much of your brain cells would be lost if you binge the whole season at once  lol
i can t believe they made my boy fred a feminist
reminds me of when people used to declare that chivalry was dead. it s not  but it s not like these people care about where it thrives.
thank you for letting it be okay  to be masculine. i don t need you permission  but it s nice to hear it.  if i read it right   it says men should be willing to die to protect their wives  just as jesus did for the church. men should love their wives as themselves. so thank you  melonie.
surely there are stronger men than i. also  don t mean to sound like a weirdo  like the boggin look  it looks cute.
i ll be honest i don t how you even watch less than a half of a episode. i d want to buy a flamethrower and take it to that show!!!!!!!!
yo mel  you should check the criminal statistics  if we add prison  men are hurt more from other violent men in every regard  than women are  sometimes by 10x more likely to be attacked.just wanted to throw that out there  as many ppl seem to forget that we got the ultimate short end of the stick.this is why we re made to fight  cause we sure as shit run into the situation far more often  even in so called  civllized society .
a bar isnt a great support system unless you got a lot of friends there who actually give a shit.alcohol isnt a friend alone.
@chandllerburse737  it was a bit of tongue in cheek. you re right people you meet when you re drunk turn out not to be your friend when you sober up.
ha  i ll wait and see what happens to everyone else before i try that.
@batman0  i already lost brain cells just from the trailers lol
so the velma show makes it out that being a man is so easy  yet when people think of eg. paedophiles  criminals  stalkers they assume they re a male  which causes distrust from the onset. men are more likely to succeed with suicide attempts and when it comes to child custody  generally the mother is the default care giver. men are expected to work while it is perfectly acceptable if a woman never works.now i m not saying that women have it entirely easy either  both populations have their own problems  but the fact that the showrunners made that episode and clearly with 0 research and 100  opinionated  it really pisses me off that we re still having these arguments. helloo  life sucks for everyone at some point  and it isn t confined to gender  race  sexuality or whatever!aaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!okay  rant over  have a good one  yeah   d
i watched this whole show and i could say  the only funny clip genuinely was the post-credits of episode 7 with fred. the only thing that got me laughing.
i still have no idea what  male privilege  is.
i remember watching a female comic  who was mediocre at best  complaining about  how easy it is for male comics.   so she put herself to the test.  she dressed up as a man and got on stage.  she lasted a few minutes and broke down in a crying  blubbering heap of despair proclaiming to quit comedy forever.pathetic.
ive bee invisible since i started using drugs  after i quit i thought it would change slowly over time. 6 years later and im more invisible than when i was homeless and dying in the street. its freakin wild  and hard to get used to at first.now i just kick it with jesus  sometimes borrow a dog to walk  and try and be the best me ever  which is succeeding very well couldnt imagine what could be accomplished with a partner  did a lot before addiction but with my knowledge now the sky is the limit
it s crazy how a cartoon that has no affect on anyone s personal life is triggering them... lol !! at least it gives you content i suppose  !
most men  if we re honest with ourselves  don t mind life being hard because it gives us a sense of accomplishment to overcome life s challenges.what we need from women is simple.if you re not going to help  get the hell out of the way.full stop.
thank you and god bless.
believe it or not but there are some deluded people out there that are complaining that velma isn t woke enough. for real.
some people will never learn
kaling was given free rein to make this terrible show  and nobody at all called her on the carpet during the production of it. what does that mean  that she s the one with all of the privilege  of course.
i think one of the greatest privilege men have is being able to serve the people around them  especially the disadvantaged. yet the media and the world tries to influence us and make it seem okay to use others as a means to an end  that goes for all sides from the progressive to the conservative
they tried to say i ve been on omegle  never have never will do so...
society listens to and helps men  first time i ever hear of this as a 37 years old man.
that 7 second clip was already too much.
it s natural for men to want to protect women there is absolutely nothing wrong with it  you even see it in the animal kingdom.
10 15 jesus christ is the template for all men. you won t go wrong if you follow him as a man.
this is val  not velma lol
we need to get rid of toxic masculinity okay  so let s talk about mwn as victims of abuse and false abuse claims men can t be victims  men are always the abisers  - said by the same person with not an amount of irony
can they please go back to regular scooby-doo content already  ya know. where the talking dog himself is actually in it.
yes this! i think it s a wonderful thing
in the animal kingdom some animals are dominantly shifted i believe.if i am not wrong female lions do most of the work.female sharks are the biggest and more dominant if i am not wrong.and even dinosaurs t rexes the female was the dominant one.spiders eat their mates after supplying babies same for mantises.
mindy kaling grew up with more actual privilege than 95  of americans. these people are tiring.
the extreme woke left   velma was written by the right wing writers.  it s a right wing show.melonie  velma dresses like a man and everything becomes easier.me   now i know this show was written by the extreme woke left.
we know who the token written on the office was
this show is sick. i hope all who was involved in creation of this evil disaster will be punished.thank god i live in poland where women are still normal and really need men from time to time and does not think it is somewhat derogatory for them to ask for help. and men are treating them like queens worth fighting and dying for. good old days  right
they wanna help cuz its called a gentleman 80 and 90 guys were raised thst way lol.
yeah so i was in the gym doing my ab workouts on the ab machines and these guys from the brand new supplement store down the street were in the gym giving away some kind of energy drink mixes and they worked. so drive up there could of walked there it s cool in the day time. and these young ladies were in there with this fresh young gum guy. and i say like yo what s up cousins or something. and the young ladies look over at the young guy and say we don t talk to him and you shouldn t either. so i go to the gym cancel my membership and put back the sports drink from the little mini fridge in the supplement store  go home and uninstall snapchat and instagram. and i couldn t be happier...
ah yes  thank you  mindy kaling net worth 35 million . i m so glad that mindy kaling  net worth 35 million  is so willing to point out that i  net worth 250 dollars   a man  have enjoyed massive privilege of growing up in abject poverty with constant health problem  dealing with racial discrimination and physical abuse that left me irreparably riddled with a whole slew of ptsd issues. men like me  net worth 250 dollars  should be aware of our privilege  and accept that we will never know the struggle of growing up as a upper middle-class woman who never had to work for anything a day in her life because she happened to tick the right boxes at every step like mindy kaling  net worth 35 million .sarcasm aside. i m really just psychologically tired of hearing about all my  privileges . when karma turns on these people  and it will turn on them sooner or later. i will give absolutely zero fucks about them and their well-being.
there s a good movie called   just one of the guys  that shows a girl try to be a guy for her research paper. check it out. cheers
when i talked about male privilege  i just wish they actually brought up things that are actually true  instead of their perceived delusions. if you want to move heavy furniture  the higher upper body strength is very useful  it is better to be a man in that situation. not that women can t do it at all  but it is easier for men.the ability to piss standing up pretty much anywhere. no periods. etcthere s plenty of actual male privileges that exist  sure. but for a fair discussion you d need to mention all the female privileges. the current  discussion  is neither fair  nor factual. not based in reality or worth engaging with to be honest.
here is your daily reminder that hogwarts is woke af
hate to barge a bit on the bible passage  although i do understand and applaud what you meant    it is in ephesians 5 22-30  which is part of a passage about holy living  where it says wives to submit to your husbands  for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church. after that  it says for husbands to love your wives  and goes on to say that he that loves his wife loves himself  and no man would hate his own self  but would nourish and take care of himself. as intended to mention  we men have a large burden to take care of ourselves  our wives  and families  which is something many people have either twisted the passage  or as mentioned  think it is easy for us.
the privilege of dying younger. the privilege of being the vast majority of rough sleepers. the privilege of doing worse at school and graduates. the privilege the vast majority work related deaths. just for example
the sad thing is that there is a way to make a adult version of scooby doo. its on its fan made on youtube and has 1 episode and its 10 times better them velma. but they are creating ep 2. its called  mystery incorporated  they got a they got a indiegogo too.
christianity has provided more women with opportunities than any other faith in history.albiet men and women  love to twist scripture for their own selfish desires. causing division.  just like paul said it would in 2 timothy 3fear not friends  our redemption draws near.
if velmas experience as a man was accurate. she would ve killed herself at the end of the episode
i think velma is quite possibly the worst show ever made  it s like the writers had a checkbox list of everything wrong with society today and incorporated every single one into some attempt at satirical humor. but there s one major problem. cringe humor stinks.
you would think that the female comedian failing to make people laugh as a man years agos would ve officially debunked the male privilege myth. if you re not funny then you are just not funny. i don t find certain male comedians to be funny. as a man myself i can tell you that life has not been easy for me. opportunities never got handed to me just because of what s between my legs. i am still struggling to get those opportunities.
it s just not something that i want to see.  so  i can agree with you.
christianity and the old testament accused of being misogynistic  while overlooking the extra rules imposed on men  including honoring women  as a muslim  i d say this  welcome to the club.
i ve been trying to figure out your slight accent. are you perhaps canadian
all that in one day because of one interaction holy hell lol
@chandllerburse737  oh i m the other brother u didn t grow up with me!
@strong-armdagerm9112  speak proper english  what
doesnt islam think that a woman showing her hair is somehow sinful
i dont usually want to try and stir religious arguments but what the actual text says sometimes makes it hard to well accept what people seek to say even as a christian myself.
the titanic was a great demonstration of the need to protect and preserve women  like a little microcosm of societal collapse.75  of women survived.50  of children survived.19  of men survived.to break it down even further  percentage-wise more women from third class survived  49   than did men in first class  32  . with respect to the privilege of life  a peasant woman was above a rich man. and that was before  most  feminism.
you probably already know this  but christianity did not create oppression over women.  anyone doing research of ancient rome  will learn how little value women had in that society  and that was wrong .  christianity was the beginning of both men and women being held to a high standard for everyone  regardless of their background.people want to complain about the patriarchy  but they re myopic in their critique.  they look at some selfish  power hungry clown  and decide that all men are no good.  that s no different than condemning all german people because hilter was a nightmare.  many men don t really want to be in charge  because it s easier not to be .  still they are willing to do it  in part because nature has wired us to do so  and moreso because we want to care for the women in our life  care for our family  care for those around us.  real strong men want to see everyone around us succeed and flourish.  only dictators want all others to suffer.i m frustrated hearing complains that only a small percentage of million  jobs are held by women  because the reality is that most women don t want those types of careers.  instead of complaining that men shouldn t be in charge  try to imagine society completely run by women.  i don t believe such a society would last very long.
velma may be a bigger dumpster fire than she hulk
no offense  i don t like the tim pool hat. why is every photo of him in that hat  it s a winter beanie. does he wear it in the summer  just be proud of the baldness. don t try to hide it with the hat. maybe it s brand recognition for him. if he took it off  i wouldn t even recognize him. changing it now would probably throw people off. imagine mcdonald s got rid of the golden arches and replaced them with something new. you would be confused af about what s mcdonald s and what s not. maybe it would be a good thing for him if he lost the hat. it would be like clark kent taking off the glasses. don t be the female tim pool. okay  i like the hat. i lied.
who hurt mindy kailing in the past
everytime someone talk about  male privilege   the only thing i think of this that one story of a woman who try to live as a average dude  expecting some special treatment but all she got is depression.there also similar  story with worse outcome  the woman get depressed to the point she  game end   herself.
love your videos. love the toboggan. that show is the worst
this was done ironically as a skit in the 80s with eddie murphy look up white like me. unlike velma it s pretty funny.
it s always hilarious to hear about  privilege  from a woman who grew up in an upper middle class home  the daughter of two doctors  who has never had to struggle or want for any damn thing in her life...but hey   woman of color  so oppressed!
i can count on one hand th number of times in my life someone has offered to help me during my life.  friends and family not included . 36 year old white man here.
just cancel it already. sigh.also  you re just too cute in that beanie.  d
i got a feeling mindy secretly wants to be a man.
mel pool of melcast irl. lol
u know velma is cringe because thats how todays youths are!!
i don t know where velma got the idea of male privileges and i was privileged in comparison to women as she thinks
you remind me of a young jenna elf man
men should stay alive out of lure spite for these people  if nothing else.
hey mel   you know how satan likes to distort things   notice how everything we grew up with is being distorted   little mermaid   buzz lightyear   and now scooby-doo......
i can t understand why this show ever made it past the pilot stage. like  not a single person apart from the creator seems to really like it  and she s not high up enough in the hollywood elite to have all the strings to pull  i don t think. maybe she s just threatening to pull the race mysogyny cards if folks don t bend to her will.
the fact more children died holy hell that kind of bothers me.i get it women make children as per some philosopher bullcrap about nature where females are most preserved but its so odd humans have demonstrated that ideal of  we can always make more
tbh he doesn t owe any of us anything  he can wear what he wants and it really ain t that deep lol
@meloniemacgoboom  maybe i was harsh. thanks for taking the time to respond.
thank you
luv the hat !
where is this easy life they speak of
theyre trying to be pro diversity but  edgy  at the same time. their meta humor is literally talking down at the fans.
i m 5 2  and not good looking.i m pretty much invisible to the opposite sex. i really don t try anymore ha.
as a man i believe we all have the privilege to work in the sewers  build all the citys and work all the oil rigs... we just have too much power and need to be stopped...  _
people who are not men don t know what it s like to be one. that should be common sense.
no melanie i think they listened to your videos and there was like you know what we re going to help out we re going to make sure that men don t get disrespected sike b   we re going to make it worse than it already is in reality they making worse on themselves as each episode goes by when james brown said this is a man s world he didn t mean like this this is going to captain marvel level
lay down the law  mel
you re not wrong  but you didn t have to say it
velma is insulting also rip nora vincent it is sad to hear
women live on recruit difficulty while men have to live veteran difficulty
my god when will this end already!!!!!!!!
love the hat
rip nora vincent
when will this show end !why was this renewed for a 2nd season   !
i support women on their issues dont get me wrong  but that is different than being a  male feminist . those guys are not to be trusted
if this is privilege  i d hate to be serf.
amen.
walk like a man  and talk like a man.walk like a man  hey baby  you can call me your man.
i m 5 10  average body  forty  still good looking  and still mostly hated by the opposite sex. they want different things out of a relationship than we do. they don t care what you look like. women want charisma  social status  success  mystery  a man who takes charge  an alpha male. i don t put women on a pedestal. i treat them like they don t matter. that usually makes them respect me. when i m not on weed  i find myself flirting with a lot of women. thing is  i smoke pot 24 7 and it hinders my cognitive function. i can barely pay attention to my surroundings much less flirt. the times i don t get high are the most successful with women. i have two women who i see  but i want better. they have boyfriends and cheat on them with me. one wants me to be with her as a serious boyfriend  but she can t be trusted. i m not doing that. she sort of lost interest recently when i quit my job and stopped paying my rent. i m gonna go back and live with my mom when i get evicted. the woman i mess with is not hot anymore anyway. she was way hotter thirteen years ago before she had kids. i ve known her since 2009. we re more friends than anything. i think i friend zoned myself  which is fine. haven t even had intercourse with her in two months. lone wolf here. just me and my cat  monkey.
sorry i can t tell if you are warm or cold. maybe you just need more water. hahaha stay safe. take care. have fun.
speaking of crazy guys  has your stalker popped back up
beaniebabe
i don t need to even watch it i can just watch you talk about it
hey melonie  is it dress like a pirate day already and yes this is a troll comment.  you do not look bad  but you do kind of look like a pirate
great vid.
men having privileges  already the biggest cap  i continuously hearing by bitter woman who poorly chooses their type of men but still blames the rest of us.
city boy! city boy!
rip scooby doo
it s mac pool.
puhlease!!!  male privilege   i never had my man-boobs get me out of a speeding ticket.
you re so beautiful!
go boom!!!!!!
we all endure life in our own ways  some more than others but never comparable to one another  as a guy i wont pretend to claim that women have it easier or harder  nor will i ever support for women to be classed as a lesser than us guys... however  while i will happily open doors or stop to help a woman or anyone for that matter if i see they need  i dont agree with the way the world is going  and that is to crap... because instead of people  the woke-ists  are busy creating issues on subjects they know nothing about... for examplehere in the uk we had issues where blm protesters pulled down a statue of a man claiming he was involved in slavery... now had they have listened  or even done their homework in history  they would have found that that person that that statue honoured  actually was placed to commemorate one of the many people who fought against slavery... so them pulling it down  is counter to the struggle he fought to rid the world of such vile practices....feminism.... many extremist feminists often will turn on their fellow woman  if they choose that they want to live under or in a certain way  or feel like they are dependent on their male partners... when in reality they forget that there are submissive types on both genders  and there are dominants on both too... their aggressive behaviour though in recent times with the whole  kill all men   movement should be treated as not just hate speech but also act of terrorism  and by no means forgetting that their movement is literally inciting potential for loss of life  which means those involved are essentially complicit in any and all future incidents which could result in a murder or loss of life of any man  if the suspect is acting under such twisted ideals as to follow their movement  and like any fanaticism it only takes the right selection of wording or words to incite someone of unstable mindset to act out what they have been riled up to do... as for velma animation  the propaganda in the show   is a dangerous batch of misinformation that should be removed from children s viewing... and tbh from the screens altogether... due to the nature of utter bollocks it proposes within... it is literally inciting division in a time that people are already angry about pretty much everything these days  and preys on those who are uncertain of what path in life they wish to take... so velma is the type of show that sets those uncertain individuals on a path of anger and misinformed and misdirected aggression towards people who have never even heard of them let alone even done anything to harm them  yet we get the blame from these growing minorities of delusional ingrates and privileged whiners who are angry over who they have been told to be angry at not given legitimate reason why  or a peaceful way of resolving and rising above.... we truly do live in uncertain times... and i hope the instigators of those groups of misguided imbeciles are stopped or wake up before they are responsible for serious and unfixable crimes that they have created  also i do agree with what you have said 100  melonie
i thought that show was dropped or cancelled
if you think this show could be a psyop to make wokism look terrible   wait  til you see the re-booted  the proud family  by disney.  or rather   don t see it.
real men have pretty much said screw society and women and just goin solo. no more. have at it see how that works
what do you think of the couple in this video  https   youtu.be 3hlnsd0dree

...no quality control...
i feel a tota drama island vibes the characters looks made from there and it was a troll funny cartoon i love it  that s why i feel the vibes here it just a troll cartoon trolling the woke lgbtq666999blm   666  woman with woman with woman 999  man with man with man 69  woman with man
hey so pretty melonie can we just erase velma from the phase of the earth once and for all.
also men are thought to be creepy just for talking to a woman. like wtaf
hehe mindy dumdum
velma should have pretended to be a black man and lied her way into med school like mindy s brother did.
men being men   women being women those days are gone.men can  be woman or anything.woman can be a man or anything.as a guy  i used to care about women and protect my mom   sisters.i still do but modern women don t need no man so they want to be treated like me have fun it s going to be a good time no one gives me help.i have to solve my problems.now i laugh at the modern woman who don t need  no man but says   life is so mean and no one is helping. they got what they wanted.
i m all for equal rights and opportunity but being a male feminist is like trying to hug a porcupine
unaliving  is that suicide
good grief these people r in a crazy bubble thingy wen will they wake up dudes
this male privilege thing is just nonsense.
thanks!
i spotted a yellow jacket hive at my backyard. i guess i should request for a female exterminator to handle it if there s actually one.
if you get a flat tire i bring my friend to help you and distract you while i m going to the store and buy you a bucket full off flowers and chocolate
if you re going to do a review watch the show
there is nothing more satisfying then a man an woman being together living in harmony building each other up it s just real sad most men don t get a chance to experience that an now you have all these shows and games pushing this bull crap narrative that s gonna have a negative impact on humanity
hi melonie i know you are covering another video of the terrible velma series.i ll neverwatch the series.since youcover things about the wokestuff would you talk about what woke wants to change a college that i know of.thanks once again for you being you.takecare melonie
mindy sign up for her draft card  if not  she maybe eligible for male privilege federal prison.
thank you so much  bob!
good thing this isn t a review now is it
i wouldn t be able to watch this  either. the 15 second excerpts are so painful  it s hard to believe people are doing this unironically.
i urge any women to try living as a man  wait till you see how much shitter you get treated  my partner worked in f2f sales with me for a while and she was amazed how much nicer people where to here than me.
didn t a woman prove that male privilege didn t exist one time by acting like one and becoming depressed when the realization of how hard it is hit her
norah vincent may have been born a women but she had balls. because it takes balls to do the type of experiment she did .
i m tired of the wokeness in this world they are ruining the classics i grew up watching
not sure what is easier  to be a man or a woman. i think it could be a little bit easier for men  but not much  like 10  easier. just a hunch.
lgbt  is starting to ignore the lgbs more and more
velma  men have it so easy.meanwhile how often do you see women on sewage clean up how often do you see women on a construction site how often do you see women early in the morning driving the garbage truck how often do you see women retrieving bodies from a recently sunken ship how often do you see women fixing cars not saying that there are zero women working these jobs  but i do see more men than anything else. often outnumbering women by 20 to 1. there are many jobs that women wouldn t touch with a 100ft pole. if people stopped working them  a lot of bad things would begin to happen. this is just more proof of how sheltered these writers are. they ve never experienced real work and are out of touch with the world outside hollywood and twitter.
sigmund freud would be proud of the fact that the woke keep proving his  peen envy  hypothesis....
i watched last avaiable episodes... this is getting worse and worse by every episode. velma is sooo unlikeable character and annoying. tbh im sorry for kelly  she is terrible person. tbh if not velma  and how they destroyed fred s character  it could be even watchable. there are some nice characters  like daphne or neuville - they are just in bad show. but yes  this show should never be made  its one big mistake.
people are still watching it. funny thing though some actually believe adam was the first s!mp.
wow they are mocking the dead poor norah vincent you truely were a the better man than this b
i started waching episode 1 and  in less then  5 min i turned it off it so dam bad
go watch anime bruh. you ll feel a lot better.
men need women and women need men.
so does the woke crowd wake up and say...what offends us today   or do they have to check with some higher power to get their npc programming
i m sure the show is trying to make fun of the culture war in general. but it s in such bad taste. the people who call out wokeness  i m sure  would rather see a good show than a show poking fun at wokeness. and people who promote wokeness  can t stand to be mocked.
while woman were in the house taking care the kids we were fighting lions it s in the bible
men don t need coddlingnot being attacked or vilified for just being men would be good start though
good question. i think it s the first since they are constantly trying to outwoke even each other
also melonie nintendo direct today at 5 est

i hate watched batwoman so i could keep up with efap s coverage of batwoman and that didn t phase me at even the slightest. i tried to hate watch this show to keep up with disparu... i had to stop. this show is that bad.
men are dps class.women are a support class.
i still wonder why youtube thinks unaliving is more safe to say than suicide. unaliving makes it more plain as day what happened.
velma series getting worst lol
well norah vincent did just this although i m sure most people know about it anyways. is it any wonder that male suicide is so high  still a movement that does nothing but destroy will destroy itself.
what the hell does woke
she making fun of norah vincent this is disgusting
exactly the bible     and so men have discipline  focus  good morals  good work ethics    and how do women treat those men    like shit !!!!!
what are they doing with that show  absolute dumpster fire.
they was a woman who dress like a man to see how men had it so easy she ended up un living herself.
what  is this a 1980 s sitcom  that trope was played out even back then so maybe it is trying to really feel like a 1960 s throwback in all of the worst ways
i watched the first two episodes  to see what the buzz was about  and not one second of it since. i can t even hate watch this trash. i watched all the rings of power season  she-hulk and the decimation of willow ..... i don t have the energy to hate watch anything else right now.
ima biggit
you wanna be top not bottom
oh man her dressing up as a man she brings a whole new meaning too the sitcom bosom buddies my consents too tom hank s late co star  still v going as a faux king   uh that s the female version too drag queen try n keep up lgbtq n well can t believe it worked on he she getting the job oh man james brown u were right too write the song it s a man s world lol. how funny was slapping fred silly both of them yeah v .d   oh quality hmm also golly who knew sofia was in on the prank as well then kidnapped her baby she faking matricide by being victim   5 ooh
i m guessing because unaliving is a fake word and the robot algorithm doesn t listen for it haha
once it depicted minors in sexual situations it should have been shut down immediately. it personifies everything that s against god.
didn t a lesbian feminist try to pretend to be a man. only to discover we don t have it easier. she then ended the experience earlier then intended published the book and proceeded to game end herself
they belive the grass is greener on the other side and when it is. they want to blame the hard working men that built and took care of their green lawn. we have what we have because we sacrificed and work hard to get what we have. women need to realize that men are better at alot of things as men realize that women are better at things men aren t and we re fine with that. stop being so jealous woman and just be thankful. these women seem to want to be victims and weak and not enjoy the wonderful things that they can do better then men. it s called teamwork to make the dreamwork!
if being a man makes her life easier  is velma a trans
velma is a dumpster fire... i don t know why this is getting a second season...
remember no hate watch
who green lit this filth   why
wow  is this woman redpilled
if mindy kaling was a man she would have been cancelled like aziz ansari. he was funnier though.
ideology and spite the show
i lot of feminists seem to ignore the sympathy gap. ppl don t care about men like women.  30 ppl die in a bus crash including 2 woman.  ppl feel upset when woman die or are homeless and don t care about men  nowhere near as much
a great team    maybe in the past but now with most woman contamined with feminist propaganda in one way or another plus the laws that pretty much incentives woman to end the relationship for the smallest of reasons ...  it is unfortunate but the great team would be the exception not the rule
a show with unlikable characters  no plot  urinates on it s beloved source material and slams you over the head with the writer s distorted view of reality at every turn. seriously  who the eff green-lit this garbage
i m not trying to start a whole debate because of course it isn t just white men that are suffering and yada yada yada  but it s more normalized  that s the issue in all of this. racism in general is an issue of course but when it s someone of color it s a huge problem you know but when you re being racist towards a white person it s more socially accepted  i m religious so i try not to hate anyone but i just don t like how it is ok at all  i m black and white  so  it does kind of hurt when people are hating things that we can t control but i digress.
dear wokists  if being a man is so great  why do you always stop at being  nonbinary   why not go full man
you mean they didn t cancel this garbage version of scooby-doo
why are people like disparu giving this show views  no one cares about velma  do something else. at this point i think the average youtuber who watches this are the only ones seeing this.
this show is like the biggest pile of garbage in the current day and age.
i hate velma it sucks
men and women working together as a team  ew wounds misogynist  p
hate watching is the main reason
i haven t been  as ai said in the video
@meloniemacgoboom  hahahaha
i didn t hate watch and i can agree with mostly everyone on rotten tomatoes  this show is hot garbage. i m fan of animation and an old school scooby-doo fan  i can t imagine sitting through an entire season of this terrible writing and soulless jokes.
money and mindy the karen greenlit it
they really should lol!
@meloniemacgoboom  it s the common senses thing to do  but oh well.
@meloniemacgoboom  yeah they should
he may be watching with jack sparrow
i agreed with you until you started talking about the bible. i don t believe in actual fantasy.
