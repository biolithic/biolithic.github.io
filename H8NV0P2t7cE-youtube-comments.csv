adam driver is actually a solid actor.
you re not alone  adam. we are all trying to forget the sequel trilogy exists.
cant blame him he carried star wars on his back single handedly even when it was on the verge of death
i don t blame him. the fangirl shippers his character has created are the worst of the worst.
melanie a prequel fan !  yes!  the prequels are amazing. i was 8 when tpm released and i loved going to the theater to see each one as they came out.  i ll always love them.
he s basically saying that he doesn t want to be typecasted and i don t blame him either especially in an age where the movie star is becoming non-existent. in fact this why some actors avoid francis roles all together.
what i love about adam is he s clearly a real person. he served in the military  he thinks taxes are theft  and he treats people with respect. can t ask for more!
oscar isaac  john boyega  and adam driver are excellent at their craft. the writing was my biggest contention  and lf disney absolutely shat on so many missed opportunities. boyega feels the same as driver.
melonie   the prequels are my favs also melonie   ki gon jin
so happy to see you bouncing back from the negativity and your cold. i hope it keeps getting better  i got you in my prayers. amazing video as always  have a great day please!
i saw him in a marriage story and thought to myself   imagine what star wars could have been if they gave this man a good script.  he is a great actor.
glad to hear more actors from the sequel trilogy are coming out. i hope he gets more projects in the future  really interested in seeing him in that 65 movie. looks like a fun dinosaur movie!
adam driver is good in everything he s been in. great actor.
i might be laughed at  but i think that if ever they make a trilogy of the harry potter universe about the events of harry s parents and the events leading up to their death  adam driver would make a great younger version of snape  which could also help flush out how much he endured over his care of lily.
i m glad to see you feeling so much better  melonie. as far as adam driver  i can t say i blame him. he was given crap writing and he still gave a good performance. the animated stuff has been good for star wars  in my opinion.
i get the whole  i want to be an actor  not a character  thing. it kind of puts a dent in one s self-esteem and happens to people in many areas of expertise  making it difficult to move a career forward when stuck with an image that can be stigmatizing.
looking back he was the only actor who believed in his role and played it well in star wars. he is an actor to watch for. always doing different things  great at comedy  and has a gut like an old teacher while being ripped like shark!
i don t blame him. kylo had potential to be a great character. he s good in other films
he is an amazing actor.  had he been given anything to work with   he could have made the sequels great.
adam driver is an amazing actor and he did an excellent job when he hosted snl a few years back
i m looking forward to 65
hell yeah. he was heartbreaking in marriage story. dude cheats once and has to go through all that bullshit  that movie convinced me to never marry because divorce far worse on men than it could ever be on women.
@wicker man  dude  same.
he was pretty good in black klansman
i felt bad for ahmed best  whom fans wrongfully poured their hate and vitriol on because of jarjar  and now i feel like driver is experiencing the same thing  but for different reasons.  not because of his character  but because of the story and the way disney has chosen to handle star wars.
solid as a wooden block.
@wicker man  absolutely.
@john smith  ummm what    yeah if you cheat  you deserve what you get and should not be in a relationship. so you think you re going to cheat on your future romantic partners  that s a really fucked up way to be.
yeah i like him... he looks like a real person
i already did. i stick to the extended universe.
not all of us
and plus the trilogy is good
@soundrazzriton lmao yeah  is saying that how you justify all that wasted time
prequels are just as bad. bad sequels don t make them any better.
@flamesof24  agree  percent. the ot has been the only thing worth watching since it started in the 70s.
right. and when one has to do that with just acting ability because one s character is one of the worst in the trilogy  that must be a heavy load indeed.
@roikka  i remember in 2020 when he got cancelled for being patriotic after 9 11 which made me like him already he carried this thing on his back he was one of the good things out of the this disney sw
true
not only that he had to deal with all those reylo freaks...

i wish i could concur that he carried it  but that would almost imply that the sequels were salvageable. i liked his character  but the way they treated luke the heart and soul of the series  destroyed everything. literally everything. then you have rey being a mary sue. then you have both finn and poe being utterly de-valued and reduced to sjw fodder. kylo ren was like seeing a glimmer of the prequel-era  an emotionally conflicted skywalker who is torn between light and dark. but thats all it was...a glimmer.
facts me!
@captain_ unhinged  lol didnt even know hes not woke... but that makes him even better
he is a cut above solid. he has some real chops. but he had to kiss the ring like everyone else in that sh t show starwars.
@john smith  i mean  to be fair  if you cheat  you do it to yourself. the difference being that some people get away with it  and some people don t.
@math_u  yeah hes a  white person  alright.
to be fair star wars helped his career get to where it is now. i only knew him as that guy from the show girls. if he didn t kiss the ring of disney at the time  things would have been different. he can shit talk about it now because he s no contractually obligated and he s become a respected actor in the business.
@casey mang  oh no  someone said i have aids for having an opinion. how will i recover anyway...
he s really weird looking though  not sure why they keep pushing him as a leading man
@casey mang   your
@math_u  he said something slightly woke once but kind of seemingly reluctant and obviously he s not an sjw.
very true.
@virtualholocaust   get bent pronouns.. it s a typo
he is hilarious in logan lucky as well.
he is one of the only good part of the sequels
didn t some of them send hate mail to his wife  that s just weird and unhealthy behaviour.
@harbl99  yes i remember that happening. because they wanted him and daisy ridley to have a relationship together in real life. it s fucking weird
even men doing it. like grown men in their 30s calling themselves rylos and fighting people over it
they threatened his wife and kids  weird how that s never made a big deal of but say reva sucks and you re killing people
yeah  something called reylo i think. so cringe.
i ll never understand for the life of me why they decided to have kylo and rey be the romantic trio of the trilogy. in the first movie kylo tried to mind toture rey  murdered his father han in cold blood right before her eyes and crippled finn and yet for whatever reason by the second film which is only set a day or two after tfa she suddenly for no reason falls in love with him and compelled to redeem him. if anything it seemed tfa was more implying a potential blooming romance between rey and finn but i guess   progressive   disney just wasn t progressive enough to have a interracial romance  more likely cause it wouldn t fly all that well over in china.
obsessive fangirls are modern day evolution of yesterday s spinsters.
@adam   they   you mean 2-3 crazy people  he is a public figure  this is not unique!
@northstreet13  and the media said nothing yet 100s of articles on obi crap kenobi and rings of shite.
@death-king  yeah...finn...an essentially pointless character...who asks rey if she has  a cute boyfriend  in episode vii should have been a love interest  lol. everybody is already getting sick of the oversaturation of multi-ethnic couples being shoehorned into everything too.
amazing is a strong word. had many overlooked positive qualities is accurate though. that  people vs. george lucas  documentary ain t aging well.
it s pretty niche  i always appreciated that it didn t need to rely on just good visuals to be entertaining like disney s movies. is the writing corny  absolutely  but it s fun listening to for a laugh. plus  jar jar.
as it should be
episode 3 was amazing episode 1 was okayepisode 2   i skip when doing prequel marathons. obi wan jesus can only do so much.
yes they were amazing! to me they were even better than the originals which is saying a lot! i really loved how much more of the star wars universe they explored compared to the previous entries. the action with the lightsaber duels and space dog fighting was awesome as well and the score was a masterpiece that really built off of the original!
prequels are not good movies by any metric. almost everything that can be bad about a trilogy is present. you guys are the going to see in 15 years how the sequel trilogy is going to be what prequels are today  and you will be confused about how a generation can love such trash.
yeah tpm was definitely targeting a younger audience  no doubt.it s just like the first two harry potter movies  way lighter and brighter themes.watching it over again i have nostalgia but i can finally see the flaws.
still love the prequels just as much as the originals. don t care what anyone says. i love all 6 movies.
i grew up with the prequels but i wouldn t go far as calling them amazing. the flaws are more noticeable now that i m older. but they are still very fun movies  to be sure though. and as much of a woke-weirdo ewan mcgregor is these day  i still enjoy his performance as obi-wan. the clones  along with the creative alien and unique droid designs were the best and the highlights for me  also the exploration of many  different alien worlds had me wanting to see more of them. but the one thing i will be eternally grateful for the prequels existence is  the clone wars micro-series helmed by genndy tartakovsky.
he has actually had several pretty good roles post disney star wars trilogy. can t say the same for daisy ridley.
@onemanarmy36  i liked daisy in the remake of murder on the orient express . it proved to me she can act too  and that she was simply given bad direction as rey. that said  rey was the only character in that entire trilogy who mattered to the story  yet the story basically still ended the way it began  making the sequel trilogy a big  fat nothingburger. a waste of time and money  where not even the fans of them liked the ending. what an amazing achievement.can t blame adam for not wanting to be typecast at all. look at what happened to harrison ford. and even after getting han solo killed off  he still had to play him again.
he was in that zombie film with bill murray and he did 65. he was good in that undercover boss thing.i don t see how he can be typecasted.
@bob johnson  as tarantino have rightly said a little while back  the actor is being replaced by the character he or she plays i.e people only see rdj as tony stark  not rdj the actor. as an actor that s a terrible position to be in which make you wonder why the late sean connery disassociate himself from bond
why did you remind me of that.that is not a question  that is a statement.
@northstreet13  pfft  you re mad the sequel trilogy failed.
@marxisdead  too true. the only thing blossoming in tfa between finn and rey was him turning into her simp.
@lt. gonville bromhead  can t disagree with you there.
@death-king  because kk wanted only skywalker lips to be fit to be kissed by her mary sue excuse.
yeah i remember being younger and thinking him and ray would be cute but was quick to accept it when they said a relationship between the two would never happen. sadly it seems the hordes of fan girls couldn t and disney decided to pull a rooster teeth and cave to the shippers
@marcy  because the obsessed crazies bring money  simple. just look at the k-pop fandom.
@boss ross  lol i m not that crazy
@comedic sociopathy  i wish you were wrong
i want to like the prequels but besides the final act in revenge of the sith where the actual whole point of the trilogy finally happens and it s shakespearean levels of tragedy that sparks the og trilogy. everything else before that is just redundant and pointless. it s not a hate thing either because the stuff that spun off from the clone wars  shows  video games  etc extended universe stuff lucas had little to do with is the greatness people fondly remember. but with the movies  i just see bad writing  cgi and effects that quickly became outdated   and redundancy.
same. i liked all three movies.
@jimmy v  i would take the prequels cgi over marvel s phase 4 cgi any day of the week.
@spflash1523  fair enough
i enjoyed them well enough. attack of the clones was by far the weakest of the prequels.
ok zoomer
the prequels are great  they set the world for you to understand why anakin goes to the dark side. the whole star wars story is a space opera about the skywalker family. yes if you feel like it was amazing i will agree with you  especially if it s stacked against the last few garbage movies.
e1 was absolute trash. the fact that they didn t cast a  young  padme and had natalie play in all 3 is gross.
@safersephiroth  sure glad you didn t make it then huh.
@joseph drummond  what  lmao.
@anonymous cheese  at least it gave us the clone troopers which have pretty cool phase one armor.
ugh prequels suck too corny romoand whatever
@javier ramirez  for me there are only 6 movies and rogue one.
@mlpdethdealr32  yeah  rogue one is pretty good
the phantom menace was a cinematic masterpiece... the correct way to watch star wars is to start with tpm  throw the others away  and rewatch tpm.
@user unknown  it was actually horrible  only because the disney movies  at least the later two  managed to be worst  doesn t make it a good movie much less a masterpiece.
eh
john s character was a huge waste of potential in my opinion. finn had a compelling backstory that is perfect for a hero s journey arc. instead disney made him another token black character.
try kigonjin today for all your star wars related ailments and pains! talk to your doctor and ask if kigonjin is right for you!
pfft  i bet you never read all the books about wat tambor.
@jack sont  i ve read star wars  death troopers.
hurt everytime she said it.  is it gonna be like a han  hon  or han  han  discussion though
aw thank you so much!
of course!
your comment is a little cheesy  but at least you didn t say that you want her to be your future wife  lol
@lewis from spain  as long as it s only a little cheesy.
@lvthor ascending  as you have been good sport after my comment i just said that because to say  i got you in my prayers  was a little bit too much cause it s not like she s gonna die or anything.  also after giving her 50  it s obvious that she s gonna have a great day!!! so i wouldn t have said the last  please  at the end.anyway for 50  you can be as cheesy as you want   xd
@lewis from spain  good! and you never know  it s not a perfect world.
he really sold kylo s temper tantrums.
hes to ripped i think. i picture young snape as kinda gangly. its what gives us the idea from day 1 that hes a bad guy. could work tho
actually  adam driver right now is supposed to be the age snape is in the books movies. lily and james were 21 when they died  and they are the same age as snape. meaning snape was supposed to be 31 years old in philosopher s stone.timothee chalamet on the other hand  would be the ideal young version of snape. they ll just have to crook his nose a bit lol
@stefan van der sandt  dang u know ur potter.haha
maybe not as far back as when lily and james died  but i could definitely see adam driver playing snape during his time as dumbledore s agent  in a little sweet-spot maybe smack dab in the middle between voldemort s attack on the potter home and harry s first year.
@subharmonic coconut    great idea
all the actors were given shitty character development  john boyega arguably got shafted the worst.
even if it isn t stigmatizing. andy griffith s later career never lived down his andy taylor persona.
makes sense considering how diverse and eclectic driver s work is. he s worked with some of the best in the business  and his dramatic chops are top notch.
adam driver deserves a ton of credit for how he s managed his career during and post star wars. when i think of him  i don t even think of kylo ren first. i think of logan lucky.
we re not getting the good stories. we re getting the message.
adam driver is the best part of the tv show girls. i haven t seen his other work outside of star wars and girls  but he is consistently praised as a highlight of projects he is involved with. i also like the prequals. the saber fight are so much better in them.
this is the audience disney wanted. never forget that and may all actors actresses be wary.
melanie i m so happy to see you doing well!
its so satisfying to finally have the actors and creators coming out and saying the new star wars movies were trash. everything we have said for so long was not crazy rantings but concern from true fans.also  melonie so glad to see your bright and lovely attitude. god has truly blessed you to reach people. blessings.
it s a wonder he came out of new star wars without any back injuries seeing how he had to carry the entire trilogy to its finish.
good for you girl. i have no delusions over the pt  they are mostly bad strictly cinematically speaking but they have an incredible world building. all the back story about the fall of the republic and the clone wars peaked with the darth plagueis novella and didn t disappoint at all. it was the best time to be a star wars fan. a male star wars fan at least.
i would not be surprised that he wanted his character killed off in episode ix.
driver is a legitimate badass with his service in the u.s. marine corps.  i m very surprised he didn t parley that into an action-film career!
just hearing someone who isn t me talk about the jackals we let in to our fandoms who have just hijacked the whole thing. that s so refreshing. it s not just me. i m not alone  and i m not going crazy. jfc
i can t wait to see him in 65.  i think he is an amazing actor. i don t think sw gave him a character that let him express his acting for the character but i liked his character in pure rage.
you know you make some valid points.  looking back on it while shielding my eyes from the dumpster fire that those movies were his performance was probably the best out of all the characters. and that is unfortunate. proof that one guy can t save the movie.   on the side note i ve been watching your hogwarts streams and would like to say thanks for the laughs.p.s. i don t normally say stuff like this but your hair looks great.
love the energy!  it s amazing how badly star wars has been managed.  even when the pt was getting tons of hate  none of the actors disowned the movies like this.
a true actor shouldn t be tied down to one character. the ability to adapt a bunch of personas is what a true actor should strive for.
you know i pretty let down with the force awakens and i didn t watch the rest of the sequel movies. but i did enjoy adam s performance as kylo ren from the tfa. he seemed like he really cared about his role.
adam driver is a great actor in different movies and in star wars movies too and i hate to see him leave star wars movie series and do some other movies instead of star wars movies. anyway i do wish him luck as he finds some other great acting jobs in his future. anyway i just wanted to make a comment on this video for today and i just wanted to tell you melonie that i am so happy that you are feeling better and you are back making these great videos for us to tell you what we think bout it everyday. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
adam driver did such a good job as kylo
prequel trilogy fan as well. it was what i grew up with. watching them later in life there were objectivity a lot of problems with the movies  mostly the first 2 movies  but i still love em lol
and i completely understand why. he s the backbone of the sequel trilogy. adam is a phenomenal actor too. marriage story was heartbreaking.
i ve seen rumors of driver being cast as victor von doom in the mcu.
bring back gatekeeping
@john smith  what sucks is i m finally getting the chance to play final fantasy 7  the original  for the first time and as i play  all i can think about are the assholes telling me every reason i should hate the game. i don t  though. i want to enjoy the game  i want to talk about it with people in good faith  but rn all i can think about are the people who don t like it in good faith. i need a break.i need to feel like a kid again
too bad the writers didn t.
the biggest problem with his part in disney s horrible fanfiction is kylo s character. haven t actually seen adam in any other role  but anyone would struggle to make any role that is solely  edgy  angsty manchild  work.
i loved kylo ren i wished they had done more with the character than he did. i will never forget his role because it was the only thing i  like you enjoyed about the sequel trilogy. the prequel trilogy was also my favorite out of all of them!
i can t blame adam for being tired of people shipping kylo. i d get tired of it too. i agree with what you said about kylo being the only decent character in the latest trilogy
last dual was amazing the fight at the end was on point and the acting was there from start to finish trust me maybe the new movie he is making where he is stranded on a random planet might be better but last dial so far is the best movie he is in.
adam can always go donate all his money if he truly feels that way.  lol
i ve always liked adam driver. he s a great actor. i m excited for the new merch. i ll be sure to buy it soon. also you look amazing today! great video melonie!
i won t allow disney any power over my life.   with that said no matter how much nonsense disney pushes it can never take away the love i have for the ot   pt.   they can try with all their might  all their diversity and inclusion it will never break me.as in the end that is just what they want.   to steal something that i hold dear.   i won t let them.
i really like the prequel trilogy as well. episode 3 especially was really good
i think adam driver understood that it s better to make less money on smaller projects than making a lot of cash in 2 or 3 giant movies  all 3 were in 1 contract if i understand correctly . basically  aim for the long run.
not a star wars fan  but adam driver is actually a good actor. i recommend you watch  marriage story  starring him along with scarlett johansson.also  glad to see you re doing well after that cold. stay healthy.
not too worry  adam driver is a good actor.  plus he still receiving good roles and playing in good movies.
can t blame the man for how the  fandom  treats those who work on it.
he was real good in the movies  silence  and  the last duel .
when adam took off his helmet for the first time and we all saw his face in the cinema  the entire audience laughed and many were yelling out  it is professor snape  from harry potter   from that moment on i did not bother watching the rest of the trilogy  i knew it was over for star wars.
i feel bad for the guy. that s the first time i ve ever heard of an actor asking to be forgotten.
i think g fuel sent the raspberry buddy because you mentioned it mel  i can t blame adam driver to want to put star wars behind him. kylo ren was definitely the best character from the crappy new trilogy. hope you re feeling better today mel. i ve been fighting off a cold or sinus infection myself. funny how harrison ford wanted to be forgotten too after playing han solo. 65 does look good. thanks for covering this mel. god bless!
i can t wait for guys like adam driver to go back to more serious projects  i hear he s being considered for a lead role in a remake   sequel to a classic film  although both roles are race swapped it could still be entertaining. the film is called driving over miss daisy. i hear critics on rotten tomatoes have already certified it  fresh.
man i wished they used ray as a stepping stone for ben s turn to the light instead of giving him a short redemption  he really was the only reason i gave the movies a chance after  the force awakens
i remember when the phantom menace came out  i was ten at the time.  i really wanted to watch it too  i remember all the promotions there were   really something.  this is how i first knew liam neeson   i also remember reading a book based on it before the movie came out  i was really into star wars back then.  man how times have changed.i haven t seen the three new movies at all  although i did see rogue one.  my interest in the movies left rather quickly  i prefer to think of anything disney related in terms of star wars as  expensive fan fiction   with the exception of rogue one  and maybe some of the tv shows that i never saw  it just doesn t look like something i want to be invested in anymore.  i feel kind of sad saying that  as if my ten year old self would be angry with me  but it is what it is.i went from really wanting a darth vader action figure when i was a kid to now just barely being able to look at anything star wars related at all after all the stuff that s happened lately  that really does get me down sometimes!!!
the last duel was okay.  it was a little over long  ergo why it was only okay.  he was also in the dead don t die  which i liked  a tongue in cheek zombie movie with quite a few big names in it.
i am kind of honor bound to support driver  him being a fellow brother in the corp. but even beyond that  i genuinely like the guy.  i can t wait for his new scifi dinosaur movie to come out.
thank you andrew
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
adam
that top makes her look like she s got abs.  the buttons and the folds line up like that.  it s weird.
@daveincognito  i say  her top makes her look cute. she looks great no matter what she wears.
i thought adam driver gave a fantastic job in the last duel  he s a great actor.
unfortunately his talents were wasted because he s such a great actor
adam driver is a damn good actor  and if disney did the story with jacen and jaina solo like kylo ren and rey are obviously the failed carbon copies of  they could have followed the comics and used adam as jacen solo darth caedus
i guarantee that in 20 years he and the rest of the disney trilogy cast will be more than happy to come back.  look at ewan - massive star wars fan  got his dream role  then saw the way the wind was blowing and decided to criticise the films along with everyone else  only to return when offered a chance to be in the limelight once again.
great to see you healthy again. gfuel ftw   looking gorgeous  melonie
i also respect adam driver for his prior  service as a united states marine.i enjoyed the prequels as well.   my favorite prequel also happens to be my alltime favorite star wars film  rogue one.
judging from the trailer for  65   he has the chance to be in a huge hit.
you are looking and sounding better melonie. you must be feeling better. i think driver is a good actor. he will be ok.
a hufflepuff  who prefers the prequels  and likes kylo. you re going the distance!
driver deserves to be remembered for his work in 65.
it s not like adam driver is gonna come back to the franchise after they finished the character off in the end
i m more of an og star wars trilogy fan myself  i don t get that  too many muppetts  vibe from the third movie  but then again i also really love muppetts so even if that where the case ai d still love it  though that may be why i absolutly love labyrinth
i can imagine quite a lot of actors can see that the scripts they have been getting in the last few years are garbage. a lot of them probably learned their craft on older material  and would have a decent understanding of what makes a story and especially what makes a character. they just keep quiet on message in public to protect their jobs.
as for season 3 of  mando  i agree it sucks that gina c is gone. i m going to watch it because i m a katee sackoff fan. kara  starbuck  thrace  deputy moretti  and even sara corvus from the doomed  bionic woman  reboot  are all favorites.       but it s going to suck when they go to navarro and you don t see  the marshall
last duel  logan lucky and marriage story are all great movies. he s a very good actor
adam driver was great in the last duel. i highly suggest watching that movie.
aside from the horrible innacuracies last duel was a pretty good movie he was in and again he was one of the best parts for it.
he was the best part about those movies.
i was a fan of adam from girls  his character stood out above the rest kind of a terrible show.so i was excited to see his energy brought to starwars and the wasted it. so i m glad as a young actor he s getting out ahead of it. i will definitely see him in  65  when that comes out.
if only. disney are against being creative and fun at this point.
it looks pretty good. thanks for the suggestion.
the last duel directed by sir ridley scott is a good movie it stars also matt damon in this medieval knight thriller movie  and adam driver as the main role
adam will recover...he s a decent actor who got done dirty in those movies
i like adam driver. i think he is an excellent actor in both serious roles and comedy. his talents were greatly wasted on disney starwars.
she seems like the cool girl every nerd guy wishing they could meet.
melonie  you are a prequel fam  you are a treasure.
as to your question about what movies to watch with adam driver in them that are good and not star wars  my favorite of the last several years has been logan lucky. great heist movie. he plays his character to perfection.
65  looks promising  and is one of the two movies i m interested in this year. the other being  john wick 4.
honestly i think he was the best part of the sequel 3. they really should have just revolved around he a rey s conflicts.  and not some shoehorned romance contrivance
adam driver in white noise was awesome  and the movie was cool too.
i thought i was the only person on the planet who thought return of the jedi could have done without ewoks overthrowing the empire.
adam driver is good in every movie he s in. the dead don t die is actually very good and he s in that. i might be one of the very few people saying this  but i loved the new star wars trilogy. so i think that puts me in this way out there zone. lol. always appreciate your thoughts even when we disagree.
when george lucas sold star wars to disney i immediately thought  well there goes the neighborhood!
his character had potential in the first movie i just don t understand why they had to take everything interesting potentially about him and just ruin it in the second one
as a fan of gfuel i m jealous. i want the metal shaker cup. i did just get the gundam metal shaker cup and it s my new favorite.
if i was on the cover of those three disasters i would want to be forgotten as well.
when you have lost liam neeson and adam driver  both on the story of star wars and the  fanbase   you have lost the plot.
driver has proven that he is not an actor who s range is limited since doing star wars. as a matter of fact he has done some very good work since debuting i suppose  unfortunately  in the lena dunham series girls. check him out in the surprisingly good marriage story with scarlett johannsen. he  was very good in blackkk klansmannn and the midevil drama the last duel  even though some people have complained those films have woke  elements but i found them very entertaining. i suppose if you really read into them there s underlieing themes of  metoo related and racism. but as a jew with bk i thought he was a very interesting choice playing a jewish cop pretending to be a white supremacist. i actually thought he was jewish in real life up to a few months ago.  while there s been controversy about white  noise as of late because it  eerily  some would say a little to coincidentally  mirrors the train derailment in ohio. but kind of meanders with its bizzare subplot   driver as a college professor in the eighties plays that strange role perfectly opposite greta gerwig. who although kind of a  feminist icon  of this time i still like. i don t think he s done much more fantasy or adventure type stuff up to 65. but i gotta say he has become one of the rare actors who i actually am following these days that i am interested in when he has a new film out. at least at this point anyway. oh also he s in logan lucky which i still want to see  annette a musical which is supposed to be surreal and the jim jarmusch zombie movie spoof dead don t die. so some stuff for both of us to check out.
adam driver was good in silence  along with andrew garfield and liam neeson.
i stan him so much harder now
the shitty thing is  the sequels had a lot of potential  especially the character of kylo ren. if the relationship between him and rey was actually well-written  it could have been a cool reversal of the prequels  instead of love leading him to the dark side like anakin  it could have led him back to the light. but then of course they kept shitting the bed  including by making rey incredibly boring  so that didn t happen.
he was really great in marriage story on netflix i highly recommend that one.
mel  you gotta catch some adam driver movies. dude is a great actor.
he was great in marriage story and blackkklansmen  no typo . i would love to see him in more stuff.
the whole point of the nerd space being hijacked is to leave us no refuge and no means of escape. even our favorite things from childhood aren t held sacred.
normally i prefer the character over the actor. this is one of those rare moments where i prefer the actor over the character.
i smiled at brutal use of  disastrous  instead of something like  underperformed .
i love the prequels. ki gon jin is my favorite. it s the little things that can so spectacularly destroy your credibility.
if you enjoy political intrigue movies  adam driver was good in the lead role of  the report .
adam driver was hilarious in this is where i leave you.
ben swolo is past it  well  welcome to the rest of us  who endured the high-budget low-quality fan fics. you re among many.
i love him and his character
if gary from nerdrotic approves of the next season  that s the only way i would watch anything star wars.    gary has to approve.
driver is a very talented actor. broad range.
white noise is strangely similar to the east palestine  ohio disaster... and it was released 6 months before it actually happened... i would like to hear your thoughts on that in a future video. youre awesome melonie! keep up the good work.
adam is the next harrison ford as far as wanting to be detached from star wars.
adam driver is a good actor!
adam driver is a great actor. so long as he stays away from the woke shit  he will be fine. he has the charisma and technique to keep being a big star. he s one of very  very few  stars  left in hollywood.i do hate the sequels  but he was one of the very  very few things in the sequels that i liked. not his character  but his performance.
he s good in black kkklansman. he s heavily rumored to be in the fantastic four movie most likely dr.doom .
the dead don t die is a solid adam driver film
i loved him in gucci and the movie blackkkkman   the last duel  all movies based on a true story.
adam driverthe only actor to survive new star wars
imagine they did the opposite on the sequal trilogy by making kylo ren the protagonist while making the rebel alliance the antagonists and develop his journey to come back to the light side.
i always knew adam driver was a secret chad
he s a marine mel he knows what s really going on.
if liam nieson who will literally do any random action movie offered to him  not doing star wars says a lot about what disney has done to the franchise
i want to be forgotten!   --kathleen kennedy probably
if you want to see how awesome kylo ren could ve been  i show a bit of that in a pair of videos i made called  taking the mary sue out of rey part 2   i focus on kylo in that video  and  taking the childish tantrums out of kylo ren . good editing makes a big difference  and the force awakens and kylo ren could ve been a lot better with good editing.
between star wokes and being in a room with a naked lena dunham  mr. driver simply can t catch a break.
driver is a good actor. he deserves way better than what he got with star wars. his character could have been compelling if kennedy s misandry didn t f ck it up.
wtf i didn t even know gina had been fired. she was the best female character in any modern star wars media  she should have known better than to voice her opinions on social media.
i like the prequel trilogy too melonie!
out of all the sequels i like the concept of kylo ren his look in force awakens i loved its the execution could of been better i don t blame him  disney failed him and many others
melonie  i m a fan of the prequel trilogydon t make me kill you
i liked the og sw and the sequel too. i liked that the sequel trilogy cause it expanded the universe in so many ways. the og was timeless. the new trilogy had too many issues
matt the radar technician is the best character from the sequel trilogy.
there was also that  reylo  nonsense that led to people harassing his wife.
don t forget finn... he got screwed and i think his character could have been the best.  he did very well with what he was given.
i m a prequel fan  proceeds to mispronounce qui gon jin lol
adam driver is the man a freaking marine and awesome dude
he was the best thing about the new movie. they had so much potential after the force awakens being kind of weak but not bad and then they just shit the bed.
he was actually pretty funny in a movie called what if  the f word  with daniel radcliffe.
adam driver was amazing in marriage story. definitely check it out if you get the chance. it s too bad he was saddled with such an incoherent star wars script.
watch marriage story where adam costars with scarlet johansson. it s a great little indie drama where they both shine in their acting abilities.
melonie is a fan of the prequels!  truly we live in both the best and worst timeline
he was hilarious in logan lucky  and i m going to watch 65 in a few weeks.
the best character in the new trilogy lmao. only reason i watched the movies. missed opportunities with him too thanks to disney letting kathleen take over.
liam was the best part of prequel ep 1
i would hope the majority of fans have had it with the movies after those terrible sequels....i know john b. hates star wars lol
as a star wars fan  i have no comment on the disney trilogy. i like adam driver  i love time travel stuff. 65 looks great.
remember to drink water. glad you are feeling better  at least you sound better.
i am so over it as well.
adam driver is a solid actor.
wow melonie. you just cast your old favorite shaker cup to the side like that  that s cruel! lol keep being awesome
people finally finding out about woke fatigue
if there was a chance of doing star wars legends  he d be a great jason solo!!!!
we re seeing more actors really open up on their displeasure. henry cavill with the witcher  jason momoa with aquaman 2  now adam driver. i wonder if the mob will come after him
i can t blame him
this adam driver guy is a pretty solid actor  but he might be insane  what is this sequel trilogy of which he speaks ! he should be put in a disney mcu film pronto  that would surely not be career poison! actually i m glad he s going to be in 64  hopefully a solid series being born that he can shine in.  g
adam driver is really funny in what if  known everywhere outside of the us as the f word  with daniel radcliffe.
his perspective is very similar to harrison ford regarding the og trilogy. difference is driver is connected to a hated franchise whereas ford was connected to a beloved one.
his new dinosaur time travel movie looks interesting.
adam is my marine corps brother from another mother.
it was cool to see melonie on alex steins show  wanted to check out the episode but couldn t stomach alex s bare ankle in the frame.
he s really the only good actor to come out of those movies
he was also in a comedy horror movie alongside bill murray. he played an awesome doofy deputy  and it was zombies  and he was hilarious! i forget what the name of it was  but the contrast from his star wars role was so sharp you can t help but see that adam driver has other talents for us to see.
i don t know if i d say he was one of the best characters in those movies.  john boyega was good... but i don t think any of the characters were used to their full potential.
he should ve kept the mask for longer.
silence and the man who killed don quijotes are both good movies adam driver was in.
adam was so good in marriage story. actors like that are so wasted on disney trash in general. but if the money is right they will do it.
dude kylo ren has so much potential to be an incredible character with his bloodline. yet they just threw it all away for some nobody called rey.
considering how he was ordered to play what was a badly constructed frankenstein s monster of at least 3 expanded universe characters mishmashed together  jacen solo  kyp durron    kueller  you know  characters kathleen kennedy wants people to forget exist   i don t blame him.
respect to adam driver  he doesn t need to be with disney. disney has been ruining a lot of people and franchises lately
his character was the most interesting  even though it was a rip off of the original trilogy  and adam driver carried the entire sequel trilogy honestly.
keep up the good work love you
lucky logan is really good  kylo s the brother of the main character. elvis  grand daughter is in it. daniel craig is southern and hilarious.
kylo could been so much more if he had better scripts written for him.
so was he actually the face model for v in dmc5  of was it someone that looked like him
i ve had enough of star wars and i ve been a fan of it since 1978. the only joy i ve had of star wars recently was watching prequel stunt co-ordinator nick gillard s lightsaber test footage that he has put up on his youtube channel.
i do want to watch 65 and i think he was in a knight movie recently that some people liked. but i do want to see 65.
jon boyega was their most interesting character and the spit on him. he was the only original idea they had.
the dead don t die
@max mcintyre  that was the one! loved it!
he was the only person i liked in the episodes of girls i watched too. dude was also a marine so i don t think he s as mentally gone as everyone else in hollywood.
mando was good but everything else post sequel is trash
@floppyshoes  i also enjoyed mando at the time of watching it but if im being honest it was average tv with a star wars ip.
@floppyshoes  mando was aight the first season. second season was dumb though.
that movie looks pretty cool. i hope the trailers aren t deceiving.
tbh i want to just focus on my art  and whatever projects are fanmade  the fans are more entertaining.
ya ll made daddy mad again  glad to see you re better!
remember adam driver losing his shit at some of gervais most brutal jokes at the golden globes  those are the laughs of a man with no skeletons in his closet. i hope when they eventually sell the star wars licensing  a new company will give him another look. he could play jayce  or a grown up anakin solo.
adam driver is so cool looking. he has a unique face.
wait... so kylo ren changed his name to adam driver and became an actor  will this be explained in the next star wars trilogy
i think what he fears most is all the reylos who are very crazy people. besides that  he knows sw is going downhill.
lol i m prequel fan to i loved the fight scenes from ep 1-3
he s awesome in a very under-appreciated movie called  logan lucky . everyone seeing this comment should check it out.
friends don t let friends watch disney star wars
as much as we make fun of his character and his boxy ass body  adam driver is a phenomenal actor. former marine too so i suspect he just goes along to get along in hollywood as well. i hope one of these days he just leaves hollywood. more stars need to do what mark wahlberg did and just set up shop and do their own films elsewhere.
ewan mcgregor and liam neeson did fine after the prequels  i see adam driver as the same kind of actor.
disney   traitor!!!adam driver   that s my line.
they should have followed the   young jedi knights  story line. i m sure everyone can agree
love your content  3 love from norway
i m more interested in seeing 65 than i was for the last actual jurassic world movie  which i still haven t  and dont plan to   seen
who can blame adam driver  his character was one of the most wasted. he did the best he could with what crappy material they gave him.  and activists can t write anything to save their useless lives
adam driver was in a movie with bill murray called the dead don t die
a  journalist  is begging amazon to stop making lara a  huwite savior . love to see your take on this crap lol.
i m disappointed melonie didn t shake the g fuel shaker cup...
i thought he was one of the better parts of the trilogy  shame how it turned out. he seems like a good person. all the best to him. i m glad i m not the only one who likes the prequels!  those poor ewok muppets. good video!
baaaah they re making all the daddies mad
lol
prequels were better than the originals imo cuz thats what i grew up with. most people like the prequels but the ones that dont cry the loudest
@david thompson  i  too  personally like the prequels the most. i thought they were wonderfully creative.
you may not believe it  there are too many superhero movies series out there  not to mention the multiverse overload  dc was so desperate to fill their multiverse they even brought smallville back for one last time.
i don t blame him for abandoning a dying franchise and we have darth kennedy to blame
sadley jj made 4 scripts and disney went with the one they liked most and then twisted it
adam driver did a good job in logan lucky. standard heist stuff  but entertaining for what it was.
he was the best part and terribly portrayed.
not even kylo ren wants to be kylo ren.
he could do conventions for the rest of his life and i think fans would like that  he was a skywalker after all  unlike rey! .
i had to do a double-take  i thought you forgot to put on a shirt   were doing the stream topless!! one can only dream
the hype has died down and those  who have careers are speaking out.
adam driver is a good actor i don t blame him to have name link to this train week but his character in star wars was week to he wanted to be evil because darth career was his grandfather plus rey beats him with no training
sounds a lot like harisson ford who doesnt want to be bothered with any questions on him playing han solo in star wars  he actually wanted the character to die and end in the 2nd movie  he only returned to the sequels if they would guarantee han solo would die.  sadly they did get him return as a force ghost after
kylo ren had a lot of potential  he could have been the hero if rey didn t exist
i like adam outside of star wars he is actually a good actor. and it surprised me cause star wars made him seem like such a baby. lol
finn should have been a jedi and the main character
did you like the dark crystal  or its remake  i loved em
kylo ren had actual presence  like his lightsabre stance
nothing beats the original trilogy.
driver hard carried those films and the script did him no favors.. such a shame.
well  adam driver s kylo ren ben solo was one of the few good things about the trilogy  in spite of the underwhelming helmet design they ultimately went with compared to concept designs . they should have ended the saga with an episode x to make up for the travesty of viii and finished his redemption arc.
good content melonie
i feel for him. it isn t his fault the writing was nonsensical.
yes i am also a prequel fan... which is exactly why obi-wan disappointed me so much    i would start crowd funding to get you over to the galacitc starcruiser for an honest  no bullshit review. something tells me that would be a great idea.
love mando  love bad batch   ate sequel trilogy  simple as.
let s be honest.    the dude looks more like chewie and leia had a kid than solo.
he s got is new film out and it looks pretty good dinosaur
he is such a talented actor. it is a pity what happened to his career with sws. check him out in paterson.
i don t blame him. reylo fans threatened his wife and kid.
semper fi  adam.
he is a good actor but he just keeps getting cast in movies that a lot of people don t watch by choice unless they re on a date or share an apartment with someone with a significant other.
if you want something quiet and different  then see adam driver in  paterson
imo  while i disagree with you re kylo ren  i liked finn better until they ruined his character   adam driver can act and he seems a pretty solid fellow while he s at it. he is military  remember  usmc lance corporal   he s pretty based. i don t blame him for wanting to be disconnected from this disaster  because the reylos alone were and are pretty awful.  65  may be a cool movie to check out because of him. and yes  thank goodness  i couldn t agree with you more in regards to gate keeping the wokeness out of the nerd space!!! it needs to happen and it s overdue  says this og old school nerd who remembers what it was like to be a nerd back when it was the kiss of death to be any such.
i also didn t really care for the ewoks in return of the jedi. i get what they were going for  but i d have rather had it be wookiees and happening on kashyyyk. that wouldn t have been perfect  since there still wouldn t have been setup in any of the other films about the wookies or kashyyyk  save for chewbacca s existence  but that doesn t automatically make the audience aware that the empire is enslaving the wookies for labor. but the ewoks feel too... off in some way. maybe it s that they feel like they re something childish.
it s not that its too many superhero or star wars products  the quality is in the pits
however bad may adam driver feels  it is nothing compared to the fans. our star wars was ruined and we even had to pay for it. it s like paying for being able to watch the execution of a loved one. at least he got paid for it good.
driver is right and i just started your video. maybe he can go to the courts and have his record of the sequel trilogy sealed. lol.
as a christian myself  i d love to hear melonies thoughts on the revival thats happening in asbury kentucky.
didn t like rey  didn t like ben  didn t like poe  didn t like finn.
henry cavill  jason momoa  adam driver... seems like hollywood actors are starting to get tired of the bullshit.
i don t see that  but the sequel trilogy really set back these actors and actresses careers!this why none of them want  to comeback!
i m not surprised those reylo shipping freaks harassed him and his wife.
originally it was planned to be wookies with the death star being built over their homeworld but george wanted a far less technological advanced race to be the ones to help bring about the empire s downfall. that being said the ewoks were too primitive in my opinion where it just comes off as silly that this whole evil empire with millions of resources  soldiers and all kinds of advanced weaponry can be easily bested by a bunch of teddy bears with sticks and rocks. it would have made way more sense with something akin to like the gungans who were primitive in terms of their technology but not to the extent of the ewoks which had basically nothing
the last duel was pretty good  if you like slow drama.
5 28   house of gucci was good  except for jared leto s character coming off too much like a  it s a me  mario  caricature. and i ve heard good things about marriage story.
can t blame him.
there was a best character in disney star wars trilogy. lol. he doesn t have to worry about me  i will forget him
there s 6 movies and that s it as far as i m concerned. george lucas or bust.
it s a odd choice and not really popular  but i thought he was great in the dead don t die.
last duel was great!
rip star wars 1977-2012
can we all get over star wars now. hey melonie. and yay!!! gfuel code mac everyone and save
i don t blame adam driver
the mouse managed to turn sw into spoiled goods. and any actor with sense now wants distance.
the way that his character was jerked around  i don t blame him. but then  all of star wars kind of got the same treatment in the sequel trilogy.
bit of info  i was born the exact same day as him and we re both called adam.
i feel bad for adam. he is a great actor. i really hated those star wars movies tho. went and saw the first one made by disney and left feeling sick. i knew star wars would be tainted forever.
bill murray did a film with driver  the dead don t die.
he is one of the reasons most people got over sw  he starred in the shit ones.
i remain unsurprised that all new content for star wars is always before the sequel trilogy  so far  hopefully will remain that way for a long time . it s either between original and prequel trilogies or between original and sequel trilogies. even disney knows they f     d up  they just don t have the balls to admit it openly xd
too many muppets
the shitty thing for him  is that his was the best performance of the sequel trilogy. when  or if  people think of that trilogy  the name adam driver will be remembered.hopefully  he finds many other projects for his name to be attached.
after blackkklansman i figure he will be ok...
ikr  im done with all these franchises at this point
not really. to be honest i would prefer to associate adam driver with anything other then star wars. the man deserved better  same as all the actors who had the misfortune of staring in that godforsaken trilogy.
@death-king  he s done amazing work elsewhere. i m just saying that he had the best performance in said trilogy  and i hope he doesn t get pigeonholed.
@michael fink  that s really not saying much. that s like saying michael gough had the best performance in batman and robin and all he did for half that film was look sick and stay in bed. adam did the best he could with the material he had to work with but it s all in service of quite possiblely the worst villain to ever come out of star wars.
@death-king  i fail to see where we disagree. shit movie. good actor. not his fault.
somebody needs to become sane at disney and use the world between worlds to erase the sequels.
in other words liam neeson means it s been over done and ultimately ruined. glad to see a star wars actor who gets it. disney killed the magic
kai gon jin. my favorite star wars character too
i don t think he was ever really a fan of the sequel films to begin with. it was kk that suggested him  he didn t even have to audition.
adam driver rocks
can t say i blame him.  i didn t think 7 was bad  but it didn t give me the sense of epic struggle and wonder i got from the first 6 movies or even rogue one. glad finally someone else admits the prequels are awesome. they had some annoying bits but for the most part brought a lot of great stuff into the setting and dialed everything up to 11  including forced love lines. plus  i love clone trooper and storm troopers  and i m not a fan of force users or the jedi besides qui gon  obi wan mcgregor  and anakin. so seeing non force users relying on their skill and kit like jango and clones in action made me want to do back flips in the theater. for me it goes rogue one  episodes 3  2  1  5  6  4  7.
i can understand his feelings on this. mark hamil s cinema career was effectively ended because of star wars. with  a new hope  being a cultural and financial success. driver seems to have dodged that bullet though. additionally with the likes of kathleen kennedy at the helm they will likely continue to drive the franchise into the ground. not something you would want your name attached to.
i like the  good soup!  memes.
i m excited for 65. driver shooting dinosaurs equals good stuff
he should ve been jacen solo.
glad to see someone else who s abandoned mandalorian because of what they did to gina carano. that was utter bs and i have zero problem dropping a show that was actually better than decent.
i only followed you because you like classic tomb raider and now i still follow you because you have great hot takes i mostly agree with.
i can t believe what i just watched. she did not mention tomb raider once!
the best addition has been mandalorian.
disney oversaturated the market with this many shows and movies  where you would need to see al x previous shows movies to understand what comes next  its quantity over quality
fin and kylo are great characters that were poorly written.
to be fair as a life long fan sw  i actually thought episode 7 was a solid entry. but it went waaaayyy off the rails after that. 8 was by far the worst with 2 being a close second. 9 was just ok. best being 3 and 5
logan lucky was ok but he was good in it and the last duel
honestly don t blame him. to his credit he tried  he tried so hard to make his character work but he was handed hot steaming garbage. people go back and forth on which is the worst character in the sequel trilogy and my contender has always been kylo ren. yes rey is awful but rey comes from more of the tragedy that the writers were more on the twist of her lineage than her actual character. so they spent no time developing her  but instead were focused on this super amazing twist they wanted to do down the line. but since the writers could never agree what said twist was she just became a mangled mess of a character. kylo on the other hand suffers from this in spades and then some. the writers clearly had no idea who the hell he was and so his scenes feel like he is a completely different character. every new scene he might as well spin a giant wheel saying  what s my motivation today  . hell the throne room scene he changes his motivation like 5 times in that one scene. one minute he is a psycho  another he is tragic  another he is conflicted  another he is a screaming child. it was never consistent and poor adam driver was stuck with this hot mess of a character.
if it ain t broke  break it
this is why i stick with the star wars expanded universe legends
let s be honest melanie the show would of been really good if the males were pushed to the front finn and kylo they even had a rematch arc. and luke getting over his hatred for the empire to train a young storm trooper to overthrow the first order.
adam driver is a really good actor he s been in a lot of good movies like the movie with a black detective where adam driver goes undercover to try and arrest a group of kkk members i forgot what the movie is called blackkklansman. really good movie
if you want peak star wars in videogame form  try playing kotor ii  the sith lords. especially with the restoration mod on.
he doesn t want to become another mark hamill.
kilo ren was good until he took off his helmet.
i can t disagree more about the prequel trilogy  everything else i agree  but  that
if i were ad i d be more worried after the movie white noise. not only was it the worst movie ever  the events of that movie are now playing out for real in east pallistine oh.  truth in the movies and lies in the news.
such a waste of a good actor. with the bad writing he was given for the entire trilogy  most of the stuff he would do or things he would say would lead to huge bursts of laughter from my theater each time with just how overly dramatic  weak  non threatening and adolescent the writing made the character. the largest laugh was when he kissed rey before he died with about the same sexual tension as two cousins even i started dying with laughter at that point.
i ve been over star wars since prequel haters drove george lucas to sell the franchise..now look at the results
disney had so much books with interesting and great stories to go off of when they bought star wars instead of using that great work they decided to do their own thing. they even ripped a few things off from the old books to put into the movies like han having an evil son. they even had an alien race come from another galaxy to invade theirs and lost a lot. so much could of been done with those books. i would of loved to seen some of them on the big screen instead disney took a dump on it all. it just sad to see. even the books disney been releasing in their version of star wars are bad. the only ones i even like out of theirs is the books about thawn s story. they murder this great opportunity before it could shine.
i m still not sure which trilogy was worse  the prequels or the sequels. glad adam driver is distancing himself from star wars. he s great.
i agree with adam !!i will forget the entaire star wars  disney s trilogy
it s funny - i was quite high on him and john boyega coming out of the sequels  but boyega... eh. i think i overrated him based on attack the block  but driver looks to be the real deal.
it says something when both a prequel actor and a sequel actor both don t want to come back to star wars too bad disney won t listen
he s embarrassed to be part of a series of movies that destroyed a beloved franchise. too bad we all can t forget it all too.
you prefer the prequels over the original trilogy ! ! say it ain t so  mac  say it ain t so!!!!
prequel gang rise up
yeah being remembered as darth emo probably has not helped his career much.
only reason i watched after episode 7 was because of kylo ren.
that documentary they made about him doesn t age well. anybody saying the prequels  graped their childhood  owes george an apology. i m no better  i wish joel schumacher was still alive because i owe him an apology about batman and robin. george and joel never felt like they hated me as a human being.
@john smith  ikr the pure hatred towards george was uncalled for but he didn t react like disney reacts to criticism he simply said f k it and sold his baby
we had this fear prior to tfa
i m not going to lie and blindly say every creative decison george made with the series was the best thought out but at the end of the day i will give respect for trying to get his vision out there. execution aside george knew exactly what story he wanted to tell for the prequels and at least put in the effort of trying to make it different from the original trilogy for better or worse. but regardless again of whatever decisons he might have made with the series at the time clearly it was never bad enough  despite what some people might like to claim otherwise  to the point that the entire appeal and profitablilty of the series was flushing down the toilet as we have seen over the past decade under both kathleen kenndey and her disney overlords of the franchise.
it would make things easier if disney simply swallowed their pride  own up to the fact the whole trilogy was an unplanned disaster and erased it from the canon as it should be but we all know that s never going to happen.
while not a badass  he was could have been had he kept the helmet on more.  that said  im sold the rise of skywalker is about ben solo. he turned back to the good  he s solowalker blood.  he ascended for the girl to go on  but its title is adams character  has nothing to do with the orphan girl.
after all the shit and death threat him and his wife got from those toxic reylo shippers  i don t blame adam driver for wanting people to forget his role in star wars sequel trilogy  there are so many negative things adam driver probably associates with the role of kylo ren that he probably regrets doing it.
true  but let s be real here  there s one character from episode 1 that brought out the anger in all of us and he needed to go away and he basically did and it was that annoying jarjarbinks.
he was terrible in the star wars films  among a sea of even worse  but at least he has the wherewithal to realize it was a massive mistake. got to feel a bit sorry for the guy expecting to be the new darth vader and ending up as the new jar jar binks instead.
i love me some sith lord jar jar
kyle ren could have been a good character  he started out promising  ultimately he was not  though i don t blame the actor for any of that
people are probably reading into this too much.  because it s an older interview  what adam driver seems to be describing is the luke skywalker dilemma.  star wars characters are so iconic it s nearly impossible to separate the actor from the character.  mark hamill will be forever known as luke skywalker  despite jar jar abrams  and rian johnson s best efforts.  adam driver doesn t want to be thought of as kylo ren.
qui  in qui-gon jinn is pronounced as  qwai  or  kwai   not  kai . lol
that s why i support hogwarts legacy. the woke don t or can t highjack it.
you will love the last dual great movie
i ll be honest  ren s character development in  the last jedi  was great. i was really loving him as a villain for the sake of being a villain - no desire to bring order to the galaxy  no desire to be like grandpa vader  just rule the galaxy just because.
was kylo really a decent character in the new films  he was a supposed sith lord who regularly threw hissy fits and couldn t even beat a girl who had zero training
make gatekeeping great again
sooo that s what fuels you  you snort g fuel like the other ttv sweats.
i m not surprised about liam  he did a couple of christian movies. including the pilgrims progress.
if 65 comes on clearplay  i might check it out.the only thing evolution got right was setting up good fantasy stories
it s the same as when the first movies were so overdone that the actors whom actually had careers were so sick of the trilogy. adam driver is actually good at acting and doesn t tie himself to politics and activism.  that s why he s sick of being tied to it because disney is woke insanity.
now that i look back. the skywalker legacy should ve been about him not rey. he should ve been the focus point.
adam driver did the best he could with the dogshit scripts he was given with star wars. no one blames him for how those movies turned out. he was by far the best part.
he reminds me of marilyn manson. he should do a marilyn manson biopic.
funny enough disney has introduced characters that are far more insufferable then jar jar at this point in my opinion. whether it be mary rey sue palpatine  admiral purple haired bitch  no one s favourite inquisitor reva or the literal social justice robot from solo  a star wars flop.
i like return of the jedi. a new hope was my least favorite of the originals but still great!
the last duel was actually really good  a bit slow at first but a damn good film.
andor is great  mandalorian is great
just like john boyega has had enough and that is just signs that the st needs to be decanonized and they need to do the thrawn trilogy with the real grand admiral thrawn and not that blue faced loser in rebels  and if you are wondering who should portray the characters there well look no further then sebastian stan as luke  karen gillan as mara jade and christian bale as the real grand admiral thrawn not benedict for we need an actor who can do villains and christian bale is a show in for him . what do you think melonie
he was good in blackkklansman.
kylo ren was one of the most interesting characters in the trilogy  next to finn . damn shame that kennedy prioritized her mary sue insert and misandry over telling a good story.
kk s droogs were all about hating straight white guys  yet a straight white guy was the most memorable part about the crappy trilogy. plus  the wacky reylos didn t do him any favors. adam is a good actor  he deserves better. hopefully he gets better roles and has a long  successful career.
the coolest name in stat wars
i like him more than say timothy chalememet.  no not checking spelling     driver doesnt seem as narcissistic to me. great sense of humour. i think kylo ren shows he can do any role.
i wonder how the reylos will react to this
dude  driver deserves so much better than what disney has created. we all do  though. let the wolves have that mess. can we have the eu back now
me personally i don t think he s that good of an actor  so there s nothing i could recommend from his other works. with that being said  though 65 looks like something that could actually work for him.
you know that s kind of funny he s like harrison ford want to be forgotten and harrison ford han solo like father like son that s too funny
i have a lot more respect for adam driver because of this. he recognizes how crap the sequel trilogy actually is.
i feel there are two kind of star wars fans now - the lucas era fans  tradition  crass mature humor  lots of space battles and lightsaber duels ..annnnnd the k. kennedy era fans   diversity for nothing  women perfect men donkeys  and as little combat as possible cause lazy .i m old and know that han shot first so guess where i fall in
i thought kylo ren was the worst  character  of that whole dumpster-fire trilogy  aside from rose tico  of course .   but i do hope driver manages to find success as an actor outside of star wars.  just like boyega  isaacs and tran.  all of them turned in great performances despite their lousy roles  and the sequel trilogy s many failures were no fault of theirs.
melonie is a based prequel trilogy enjoyer !
should ve ended before he even started  he did his best but the last trilogy left a bad taste in every real fans mouth.
originals had the best story and space battles. prequels had the best fights. sequels had the best let down.
yeah im sure you just got real lucky.  like people know you can get caffeine in tablet form right   but hey shill g fuel cause you are ever so inpoverished.
she said she liked them better than the ot. heinously bad take.
i also really like book of boba-fett. idk why people didn t like it. i thought it was really good story telling and the action at the culmination with the last 2 episodes was amazing!
can we get on board with more mandalorian  that s the direction star wars needs to go.
driver is awesome as shit and he is a vet!!!
i love darth maul. the only mother trucker able to kill liam neeson. neesons character qui-gon was the best of the modern jedi. he saw all the flaws of the jedi order and pointed them out and they didnt listen to him. the jedi order also didnt believe him about maul being a sith and look where that got them.
quick question  do you have any regrets about the tattoo s
well considering that kylo ren is a rip off of jp from grandma s boy  i don t blame him for wanting the character to be forgotten.
i m not surprised that he doesn t want to associate himself with star wars. especially with the weirdo s of twitter. i checked out of star wars after mado season 2. i didn t even finish the sequel trilogy only made it to tlj then noped out the last movie because of how they dragged the franchise i grew up with in the muck.
not related to the video topic  but i love your hair in this video
i love liam however he pisses his pants
he was good in house of gucci
at least adam driver had something to do in the disney trilogy with the star wars name on it.  if there s anyone who should be pissed about disney star wars  it should be john boyega because his character  finn  was not a rehashed character of what we d already seen in the star wars original trilogy.  however  kathleen kennedy and rian john saw to it that finn was put in a useless side plot that was pointless to a movie that was detrimental to both characters from the original trilogy and the disney trilogy.  finn was a storntrooper who defected from the first order  and as mauler sarcastically said in his review of the force awakens   can t wait to find out more about his character.    but we never got to really find out why  nor was he given any character development that would make his knowledge of being a stormtrooper advantageous to those trying to defeat the first order.
disneys star wars made the prequels look like heckin masterpieces  lol. can t blame him for running as far away from them as possible. i can t agree with you about his character though. emo vader was the worst.
i guess the only star wars actor who might be happy to be forgotten
i thought adam driver was great in paterson and marriage story  hes a very good actor  can t judge him based on that star wars sequel garbage.
it is amazing  my favorite franchise  sw  was ruined by kk and disney. my family was really into  it until the force awakens.
i like the prequels too. don t be ashamed.
don t blame him. weirdo shippers were publicly fantasizing about his wife and baby dying. not that anyone would have heard about that. the mainstream media pretended it didn t happen and focused instead on inventing stories about the  toxic  fans of the original trilogy being mean to kelly marie tran.
gfuel can t be good for you. as much as i d like to try it....
the prequel trilogy was arguably not great.  but the spin offs like clone wars  rebels  bad batch elevate those movies into greatness.  the sequel trilogy is so terrible that they don t even want to acknowledge any of it in the modern shows.  mandalorian and andor have no mention of first order or any of the crap from the sequel trilogy.  really the only smart move disney has made with star wars.
check out white noise for sure. what happen in ohio happens in this film its kind of creepy
boba fett was awesome in my opinion so was kenobi
@max mcintyre  i couldn t get into kenobi. sadly my bad had passed away right before it came out and he was both of our favorite jedi. i tried to watch it but didn t care for the black lady that they picked to be the protagonist or the way they portrayed leia when she was younger. i m sure it gets better but i couldn t get through the first 3 episodes.
nope it s awful.
if they hadn t fired gina  maybe.
much like kenobi boba fett andor and the bad batch i can t wait to watch season 3 of mandolorian and ashoka
@joseph crabtree  this.
@max mcintyre  u liked kenobi and boba fett  well i guess theres still people that like marvel so to each their own
@mrroundtree  yeah it is they should just stick cartoons instead even the sequel trilogy is better
ford wants to be forgotten too in connection to sw.
adam driver was cheated in his role of ben solo. as the grandson of anakin skywalker  disney s sequels should have focused on ben solo  kylo ren story and been the concluding chapters of the skywalker saga. instead he was a neutered vader wannabe who lacked threat or focus  who only served as a punching bag for rey.
using anything from fandomwire as your source immediately undermines the credibility of your point. they exist in that fringe area with the other dumpster fire website giant freaking robot    frequently presenting half truths taken out of proper context  based on the histrionic opinion of the author and filtered through a determination to indulge click bait to a degree that smacks of desperation  probably because they realize how worthless their site really is.
adam driver is in a funny movie called blackkklansman
everything was awesome except the muppet comment  muppets are awesome melonie  you gotta have some room for some jim henson in your heart!
no the third season of mando is gonna be fire you gonna have to watch it have you scene super bowl commercial of it omg it s looking like it will save disney
i hate it for adam driver.  but i also hate it for the other actors in this crapfest of a trilogy.  there was so much potential in the first movie  but the second movie turned the potential into a cesspool.  i hate that boyega s character finn was turned to crap and wasted completely after a very cool growth potential story in the first movie.  i hate that ridley s character rey was given zero room to grow and develop.  i hate that so much possible good was destroyed.
yes we can blame him. the dude happily collected those paychecks and went along with the agenda. he happily said the lines about burning down the past. yes we can blame him. yes he should be bothered by it for the rest of his life. his legacy is the destruction of star wars. even mark hamil is not free from this blame  nor is harrison ford  nor carrie fischer. we should never let adam driver forget his prime role in destroying star wars. i have no sympathy for him and i hope people make him miserable.
mandalorian is awesome.
aside from the woke stuff and the cringe dialogue  the biggest issue with the sequel trilogy is that they literally just had no plan going in. jj is great at world and lore building  but has no clue how to successfully end a story. rian is just all about his ego and thinks he s some fancy art house director that needs to  subvert  everything. then you have kennedy and her singular focus on  the message . so you take these three individuals and just turn them loose with no clear plan for a beginning  middle  and end. the force awakens was underwhelming  but you could have spun a good story from it. the last jedi left them nowhere to go with the story. then they tried to frankenstein some shit together at the end. it just simply did not work.
these are actors and they just wanted a job and they did it. as far as i know i ve never heard adam say anything crazy and stupid. i ve been in acouple shows that i later wanted nothing to do with  lolita is one. thankfully they got my first name wrong in the credits so i could leave it off my resume.all the hate should be saved for the people behind the camera not infront of it. at least the actors that don t go all high an mighty and believe that their farts don t stink. we all know who they are.
driver has nothing to worry about  he s a sold actor. daisy ridley is kind of fucked though...she was alright in murder on the orient express but other than that she s pretty much going to be daniel radcliff from harry potter.
i loved darth vader  darth maul was never developed but i really liked him.  what they did to post-childhood anakin  and then darth emo really created a corollary of the progressive democrats  socialists and globalists recruiting the most broken of people into positions of power and violence.that being said  adam did a hell of a job in his portrayal  i like him.  other than that they pretty much destroyed the franchise with their woke agenda.
there s only 6 star wars movies
no disrespect to adam driver but i gotta disagree about kylo ren being one of the best things came out of disney sw.
he was funny in logan lucky
kylo ren could ve had a much better story being vaders grandson. but no  kathleen kennedy had to swoop in royally fuck the entire sequel trilogy up and everything attached to it. the 4 main actors didn t even like it  and knew it was going to be a dumpster fire
eventually it ll balance back to normal but not without the woke leaving a mess of issues behind. i m seeing actors regretting going far left or appeasing the woke agenda. the insanity will cease but it ll take time to recover from all of this. myself included.
must be an ai article ...ben affleck wasnt in the last duel..it was matt damon
it s nice know some people appreciate the prequels even though they get alot of criticism. ad for the newest trilogy  i didn t even watch the last two. when i saw force awakens  i wasn t impressed with it.
let the past die  kill it if you have to!
it s nice to see how different opinions can be. when the phantom menace came out  i was 29 and i hated it. i still don t like it today. the prequels are way too cgi saturated and while the ewoks in rotj were  too many   they were at least a boon against jar jar.. but so what  just opinions.
people liked his character in the sequel trilogy  i hated him as a villain  reminded me of the school chess club in cosplay and trying to be scary haha
they did him dirty man
i say go read the star wars expanded universe as the real grandson of darth vader and his successor is jacen solo darth caedus. kylo ren is a frail copycat of jacen. i hope driver finds great roles to play in for many years to come however.
prequel gang rise up
i hate kylo ren even more the mary sue ray or as i call him wimp darth     . i wish i could forget him     . the only i hate more  in the all disney star wars trilogy  which is so horrible that it make the normal bad prequels look like masterpieces   is the robot l3-37 in solo which still give me nightmares
kylo ren is a garbage character  but i always got the feeling that adam driver is a better actor than that role would imply. if i was in charge of star wars  i might cast him as one of han s sons jacen   darth cadeus  not luke s son ben.
he s better than this  great actor
can t blame him for a second  still 65 looks good.
2 42 same. but only cause if the clone wars show  pre disney buying it
i actually understand and kind of agree with a lot of your statements about the woke mob and twitter activists that destroy a lot of stuff. but i actually can not agree that the latest star wars trilogy was bad. i actually liked it! also  i sincerely do not understand what people dislike about it. maybe i just don t take some of the things in  that people are angry about  some of the  society crap  as some people called it. also  i am not as much in opposition to a lot of the goals of the woke folks  of course there is exceptions. but i just had nothing bad about the movies to say. maybe i wasn t overly excited about them  but as a die hard star wars fan  i honestly enjoyed them. so i kind of acknowledge that maybe i am such a die hard star wars fan that i was so happy that any star wars was on the screen that i did not even notice all the bad stuff that people did not like and complain about the film  but still  i have to stress out again  i do not agree with the pretence that the movies were so bad as they are portrayed in general public discussion.
used to love the prequels then i hated them and now given the massive amounts of damage made to the series thanks to disney with just their piece of shit sequel trilogy alone i look back at them again with a mutal respect. i m not gonna lie and say their flawless movies god no. many of the problems people criticsed them for are still very much present but i at least give george lucas credit for trying to tell a story  trying to expand and add to the mythology of his original films. i just think ultimately the execution was what overall lacking. disney on the other hand has done nothing but help to permently destroy my passion for this series. any star wars i still even bother with at this point is anything from 1977 up to 2012. everything that has come out directly under the mouse i disregard as nothing more but fan-fiction and yes that does also include rogue one and mandalorian.
when the actors are abandoning the franchise your movies might suck
his character is already dead.  not that it was really all that much to begin with. if anything  we should take a bit of their own advice as pushed through  kylo ren  and use it on the pile of crap dumped on us by kathleen kennedy and her cultists.  let the past die. kill it if you have to.
really you could throw everything in the garbage except for maybe bb-8.
can t say i blame him. his character was a total joke and a miserable accuse for an antagonist  i might go as far as to say he was easily the worst written villain to ever come out of star wars period   that constantly kept getting his ass kicked by some untrained mary-sue despite his supposed decades of training from both luke and snoke  was pretty much sidelined in the last movie by resurrected palpatine and his seemingly only importance by the end was to give up his own life to resurrect rey back to life. seriously if you want to see a better verison of kylo ren s character just pick up and read anything that involves his expanded universe counterpart jacen solo darth caedus.
i blame the big bang theory for screwing up nerd fandom. i still haven t ever seen an episode of it. they all came off as posers lol.
i checked out of the mando after gina was fired
honestly disney made the prequels soooo much better.  go figure. wtg disney.
i thought he was horrible in star wars.  but i love him in everything else
with what they did to the franchise  prequel fans are a welcome and better bunch than the cringe turd brains  especially the cringe ship fans.
i do agree he was the best part of the sequel trilogy of puke. but i disown the sequel trilogy and do not consider it cannon at this point and will never stomach it again. there is a lot of wasted talent in those movies and the writing is rather insulting honestly  offensive in the name of star wars. you would be fun to watch the prequel trilogy with  although i m more of an original trilogy person  the prequel trilogy is star wars gold compared to disney s garbage. it s campy but fun  and the story is generally pretty solid.
of course the marine would be openly based about it.
melonie  his name isn t pronounced as  ki-gone jinn . it s pronounced  kwi-gon jinn .i cringed every time you said his name.
ot hands down  i have the original vhs release boxed set mint  and special edition pre-disney.  i refuse to touch any disney star wars.  mandalorian included  i am pre-disney era sw for fan.
yeah  the old school fans feel for driver because of the weird disney shippers.  all the actors i feel sorry for because they got suckered into this cringe fest called a sequel trilogy.
i have no idea how anyone can enjoy emo angsty anakin  and kylo is even more emo angsty... driver might be a good actor  but the character he portrayed did nothing good for the sequel trilogy.
kylo ren is the only good thing to come out of those movies   .and bb-8
no shade  but i didn t like kylo as a character. for a guy who was supposed to an imitator and hero-worshipper of darth vader  he was whiney  hyperemotional  and unhinged. by comparison  vader was stoic  driven  and composed. he also didn t have any of his father s swagger or his mother s moxy. he was just...a guy in a mask that he didn t need  imo.
bet you didn t know that disney has plans to reboot starwars  .. and 3 scripts have been written. and also on another note there are also going to be 3 more lord of the rings films based in the 3rd part of middle earth  also i bet you didn t know that we are also going to see a reboot of all the hammer horror movies starting with   the mummy  and every single one will be r rated mmmmmm
sorry  i was not a fan of kylo ren. i don t blame driver  he acted his part well. the part itself was a man-child. it was as if darth vader was re imagined as raging millenial. i freakin  hated it.
the only decent character that came out of new star wars  ehhhhhh let s not go that far now shall we  kylo was nothing more but a watered down and worst written version of darth caedus from the expanded universe. as far i ve seen the only decent character to come out of new star wars has probably been k-2so who was also the only likeable character of rogue one.
very good.
at this point  even writers  directors and producers must be bored with star wars
brilliant comedy actor snl secret kylo ren boss  oil baron  ren faire knight!
take out that jar jar character and a little cheesy dialog and the prequels are almost perfect
being a prequel fan means you like chunky  shit rather than runny shit. honestly  any star wars between the original three and the  mandalorian is runny  chunky crap.
i am going to go eat my depression away queue a jabba the hut meme  now that i subscribed you must listen to my every word because i am entitled as heck!! lol i am just playing much love and i am praying for you
i don t blame anyone for not wanting to be associated with the mary sue ray trilogy but at the same time he knew what kind of wokefest it was to begin with and should have refused to have anything to do with it at that point instead of taking part in the horror of that toxic feminist nightmare. the fact that this wasn t just one movie but three just compounds the hypocrisy. how about be a man and deal with the consequences of your own actions. don t complain about something that you helped to cause by participating in it to start with and don t try and use some bs excuse like needing the money when you already had more money than most people around the world will ever see in their lifetimes.
2 25 correction  don t you mean the sequel trilogy
lol yup
thank you! someone else who thinks return of the jedi is an overrated muppet movie
i m also trying to forget the prequel trilogy exists. suddenly a new bad trilogy comes and nostalgia lovers think that makes the boring  uneven acted  cringe prequels any better. sorry melonie  it doesn t. especially e1 2  just awful. only the ot are great star wars movies.
he was the only interesting part of those movies.
i love the sequels  but ik i m in the minority there. kylo and rey are amazing characters. the shippers are always creeps tho. i do think they make a good couple tho. they re both finding themselves throughout the entire trilogy and trying to belong in their own ways.
huge prequel fan  can t pronounce qui gon jinn correctly.
adam is a decent actor  but kylo while has some interesting qualities  he s a bit pathetic as a villain...temper tantrums with his lightsaber  gets dominated by rey without training  etc. not surprised he was worried his career would be finished by those films - it happens again and again. mark hamill  natalie portman and hayden christensen  daisey ridley and adam driver. but adam  like harrison and natalie  is a pretty good actor  and found roles outside the mold  saving his career. the lesson is still there for other actors tho  the ot was gold because lucas had a vision  and an amazing team to help him shape that vision. since that will never happen again  anyone stepping into a star wars role is walking into a field of landmines. fan expectations will be high because it s an iconic franchise  but without the vision and the guidance from people like marcia lucas  chances are that any modern star wars content is going to be trash  and will have the potential to ruin careers.
kylo ren is a misnomer.  his real name was emo darth vader!
would you say that adam driver was driven away from star wars eh  eh  . i ll see myself out. don t forget to tip your waitress  everyone
gatekeep or be gatekeeped.
wish granted
i don t have starwars or super hero fatigue  what i do have is shite movie fatigue
lucas made more money making action figures. and muppet action figures sell.
woke-wash  you should coin that term phrase. unless some one else has already.
let the reylo trilogy die... kill it if you must!  i d like to forget him too  so he s not the only one.
nice shaker cup!
great melonie mac go boom video star wars
not superhero fatigue. we re hust tired of getting turds wrapped in shiny plastic.
i like the first sequel the following two were a hot mess. i don t blame any of the actors especially adam or jon and i don t think anyone should it was the writers and directors  starting with rayn brain dead johnson
i don t blame him for doing it lucasfilm katherine kennedy and her team treated him like shit.
people are bad movie fatigued.
most people think return is the least of the og movies  tbh. although as a kid i did love the ewoks. esb is still the best sw movie.
10 18 to 10 50. exactly.
kylo ren is a decent character
john boyega said this years ago lmao
thought you were a prequel trilogy fan. why you keep calling him ky-gone
so is daisy ridley   so is oscar isaacs  so is john boyega....know what why don t we just say everyone that was against this whole shit show from kk is out.  daisy already stated in an exclusive interview and its somewhere on a anti kk site that she even came out saying  she was being used only for a feminism agenda and she only took the job cause the pay was there.  however she said also she is no longer going to do movies that are pushing shit even if the pay is good cause she wants her career intact which i give credit to daisy.  she deserves better so does oscar isaacs and others that were part of this trilogy debacle.
i liked all three trilogys but i can see the faults of the sequels and prequels
there giving us shitty products so later they can give us good movies later . this is the old new coke and coke classic trick
kylo ren is a poor man s darth caedus
the prequels are your favorites  but you don t know how to pronounce qui gon jinn s name
he doesn t want to be a-dam driver  he would rather be a-dam walker   walk away from that trash franchise!!
all he has to do is claim he s a woman now and they ll fix it for him for being problematic.
why does someone go to the dark  side
@melonie mac go boom  i dont blame him  i actually did like kyle rin  but crazy people wouldnt leave him and his wife alone.    oh melonie  did you see both snl kylo rin skits    adam was in them as rin  and i hate to say it  but because of the state of more than half the star wars projects now  his snl skits were better than what we got with him in the movies.     oh melonie  could you let me know if you are getting some of my  thanks comments     i think youtube is deleting them.  they delete my comments to my own followers  and my comments in live streams.  it will really upset me if they also are deleting my comments i am also paying for.   i might stop doing it  its not your fault. i made a religious comment regarding aliens yesterday and i would be surprised if they were to delete it.
wow melanie light mode    really come on lol
i agree about  return of the jedi . too many muppets! for me  the original will always be the best.
all the actors did a good job. it s just a story itself sucked.
logan lucky was great.
i like adam driver and domhnall gleeson. star wars had a lot of soild actors and actresses  but they waste their talent with a weak storyline with the worst plot twists and no character building.
didn t the reylo freaks threaten his wife
go boom
check out logan lucky with channing tatum and adam driver
admit it you were on team reylo.
super hero fatigue is a thing  but there are so many great stories. marvel alone has so many heroes not introduced yet! so many bad guys never introduced. so many comic book stories that they could bring to life. if they made one good movie  people would go and watch it. instead they flooded the market with alot of sub par movies  and everyone is turned off. they not only need to slow down with the junk shows and movies  but they need to find a good story arc and make a good movie. stick to the comic story  and make the movie different from all the other movies.
what s wrong with the ewoks
if you haven t watched marriage story with adam driver   scarlett johansson  do yourself a favour and check it out.
kylo ren was the only cool character that came from new star wars.
i wish daisy ridley had the same integrity as this guy and john but i guess she doesnt.
too many muppets  heresy!
ki-gon huh
yeah well all of us are.
that s a super cute top.
white noise is a film about a train derailment set in a little place called east palestine ware the locals played extras.. check it out peeps
someone got mad at me for gate keeping legend of zelda  and told me kingdom hearts was better. i said nope  and that kingdom hearts is my cup of tea  i told them if they wanna know why i gate keep that they should actually go play the games instead of watching people play because it s not the same.
commenting to feed the algorithm
kylo reh a decent character xd  i laugh at u there  he was literally the worst character in those movies  no wonder he wants to be forgotten  there were no decent characters in those movies.
i don t think kylo ren was a decent character  maybe  could have been.
2 18 i like him in the movie. i think he is a good actor  but if he had some trouble in his career maybe disney make this. i don t know what is this black actor s name but he played bad and i see him in many disney productions and he is not a good actor. always looks the same. i check adam driver and he played many films. and i think he is much much younger
i m an ewok.
kylo rhen was a decent character  what the hell
they lost in the end cause ben died. but they achieved  one thing  and that was almost killing starwars
interesting how people have revised their opinions. he was hated when the movies came out. lol
everybody is hyped for 65. we hate those movies  not him.
the only decent character  !    melonie...    smh
well  that s a fuckin marine for ya
i actually didn t like his character at all. no fault of his  it s the way the character was written. i did like finn  but he was tragically wasted in the second two movies. i liked phasma  but she was also wasted.
booooooom!!!
adam driver kylo ren was the only  decent character in the dreadfull star wars  sequel trilogy
too many muppets in return of the jedi   we didn t have cgi in the 80 s!  all we had was muppets!
star wars  rogue one was okay  those other three movies were total crap!oscar isaac  john boyega  and adam driver have moved on to new projects  where are any other of the actors and actress from star wars  are they even working
watch logan lucky!!! it is sooo stinking funny
disney star wars is such a disgraceful mess nobody wants to be associated with it or be called back into those dead roles.
you know what i m tired of  cringey clickbait thumbnails.  he has had enuff!!!   o  with an arrow pointing to his lightsaber for some reason . it was stupid enough to inspire a click just to comment on it. so it worked
i like adam driver but not a fan of kylo ren. imo finn had the biggest potential but they ruined him in tlj.
no no nope noway! totally noooooooo!  there was nothing good that came out of these movies  and him as the main villain was nothing but a joke  and a bad one at that! i don t wish any of the people who were in or made these films good will  i hope they never get a job in their careers till the end of time! if these people had any morals or could act  they never showed it in these movies or in life till now  they deserve what they get!
i know it s unpopular for me to say   goes on to say one of the most common things amongst sw fans. im not a lib or woke at all but this chick she s just to ode she s doing the exact stuff the woke people do but on the conservative side idk like boycotting stuff n jus trying to hard to appeal to the right. chill a lil we don t stress these type of things like the wokies do
kai-gon jinn
we all are
he was a good character until he took off his mask lolololol the only good character was chewbacca...... that s it
i m sorry i didn t see any of them past the force awakens but kylo wasn t even a threat. talking bout the pre-quels the villains were actually a threat maul fights qui-gon and obi both kills qui-gon  dukoo hands obi and anikin both there ass s  and grievous where as they don t show it but kills multiple jedi. at least the villains did shit in the old movie s and kylo gets handed his ass by untrained rey. did he actually do anything remotely threatening in any of the other movie s other than throw a temper tantrum
he was the only decent character. so much potential wasted.
well  his character is canonically dead  so...
they made a sequel trilogy  that doesn t sound right. doesn t ring a bell.
sad reality is  star wars was never that goodthis new stuff is just so unbelievably bad that by comparison  the old stuff looks incredible
jesus said when he comes back.. will he find the faith.. singular
he was the best part of the sequel trilogy his character was so good as for star wars disney needs to go they r terrible they r ruining star wars and marvel the force awakens was the best sequel movie the spin offs were decent but they need to keep katheleen kenedy away from star wars the problem is disney sucks they ruin everything they touch that s the problem right there they need to stop going woke that s y ppl r getting tired of movies in general check out how much money disney has lost caz of their woke garbage i m checked out of the whole disney thing that is just me
hey pretty melonie so new star wars saga was fine not a great product but decent enought maybe hardcore fans are winning like little brats.and adam driver was the best of that saga.
let the past die. kill it if you have to.
are you wearing two pants
mel  really  ky-gone
white noise wa about the ohio chemical spill train derailment. b4 it happened
i really didn t like his character at all.  he was way too whiny for a sith lord
uh  i felt kylo ren was an emo with a jewfro
he is quite a good actor with a lot of potential to grow but his character in star wars is trash. reminds me of robert pattinson wanting people to forget about twilight.
only decent character to come out of new star wars  i wouldn t go that far. adam driver is a talented actor  but the character was terrible. whiny and insufferable.later   prequel fan  i m with you on that one.  -
his character was awful and pathetic  but you can t blame an actor for bad writing.
he was the only great thing about the sequel trilogy.
ben swolo
boba is my favorite character. the book of boba fett was awful. i don t like the guy they chose to play him.
you must be new here  i pronounce something wrong in just about every video lol
star trans wars
people are tired of pretending to be woke - and you have to be woke to really have not realized how bad the sequel trilogy was.
the prequels are your favorite  but you don t know how to correctly pronounce  qui-gon jinn  the  q  is pronounced as  kw.
i agree with the bulk of your videos but i cannot get on board with this one.  he was horrible and it was a horrible character.
andor was alright  but dave filoni star wars is the only great star wars lately
adam driver is a good actor.  ren was a trash character  but then  every character in that garbage pile was awful.  the new characters were terrible and the older characters were butchered.
my girl@
content is good  music at the end is fucking godawful.
i don t blame him  kylo ren sucked.
after they ruined the sequel trilogy with the garbage tlj and rise of skywalker  i m basically done with disney s star wars as well. lol
he was a marine.  can t hold guns correctly in movies.  there is plenty of blame to go around.
2 41-2 45 what s so funny about that  a lot of people like those films especially now after seeing how the disney trilogy came out
i am way ahead of you  adam. in fact  i have no idea what he s talking about. there is no sequel trilogy. just a list of extremely  boring  horrible  sci-fi movies and shows disney made trying to imitate star wars.
his character was bs.  are you blind   every movie he was asked about his motivation.  clueless about what kyblow
that is a shame. driver was the best character in that crappy crappy trilogy
disney is the worst
he s way overrated. can t erase our mistakes.
prequel trilogy fan  i m not sure i can be subscribed to you anymore original trilogy all the way!
kylo ren was such a mess. when exactly did snoke turn him evil   why was his mask clearly some sort of ancient sith artifact   what were the knights of ren   nothing was explained.  those movies are a disaster.
i thought he was terrible and miscast. he looked nothing like. harrison ford or carrie fisher. did anyone buy that he was their son    he is all nose lol
almost all modern star wars is pure trash. this is why i never gave andor a chance when it aired. when i finally did i actually enjoyed it.worth a try for anyone.
him  me  you  everyone. adam driver is both based and like an old school actor  who acts and keeps his mouth generally shut about politics otherwise.edit  the prequels suck. shitty sequels don t make previously shitty prequels any better.
george lucas star wars is over  ever since disney bought the rights the movies have gone downhill especially star wars number 8. star wars prequel sucked due to jar jar binks   actor who played aniken in 1 2 3.
im not tired of star wars  im indifferent and apathetic of woke garbage and their hate for sane normal people.
the sequel trilogy  as bad as it was  was way better than the prequel.  the sequel had a lot of bad story writing  the prequel were just fin cheesy  and cringe.  think jar jar
i don t agree  his character was boring as hell  and he was constantly beaten by a girl jedi without training.
what feckin accent is this
white noise is a terrible movie. despite the train wreck predictive programming.
this is fine  but kylo sucked. let s be honest.
personally i think the kylo ren character was terrible and more whiny than anakin. i know others like him and that is just fine. disney has just ruined so much in marvel and star wars.
wtf are u on about tomb raider is as good as it ever has been
i m not a fan of his at all. i saw him in a couple of films and didn t like him in any.
gatekeep your hobbies from woke normies.
driver sucked as much as everyone else the story sucked the actors sucked the production sucked the cgi was the worst i had seen in some time. they should have just paid for the books and used those as ther emovies already mostly pre wrote  nothing more then i would have loved to see a vong invasion.
eu was better.
he ruined devil may cry and star wars.
adam driver is good but kylo ren was a bad character. he cried and threw temper tantrums  unlike the previous strong stoic villains like darth vader and maul. he was a cheap knock off of jacen solo kyp durron.
i m over star wars. disney made it cringy. wish their was a mass effect show. way more interesting imo.
kylo ren was just as bad as every other character  there was nothing good about any of those movies. he was a grown man baby throwing tantrums and was not threatening at all
like with hogwarts legacy. if you don t like it don t play it. if you don t like the new star wars movies don t watch them. sorry not sorry
i like adam driver  he is a grea actor.but i hate kylo ren so much! and i hate the force awakens so much  my love for star wars died. after seeing the film  i have watched prequels once and that was it.imho good films with adam driver are - this is where i leave you- the dead don t die- blackkklansman
star wars has gone down the woke toilet. disney just keeps pumping out trash after trash full of their man bashing political bs. obi-wan was a joke. the book of beta fett was turd. the mandalorian will soon be changed to the womandalorian but ironically the only series that had a badass woman  they just got rid of. now let s all kneel before the great rey  identifies as  skywalker.
star wars dropped this dude..first.  notice no show moves forward.. why do i care where mando or all these guys go if i know they are losers in 80 years.  a tangent what if show could be great.  because clearly they don t like where they wrote it
kylo ren sucked as a character.they took off his helmet in the first movie he s in that s not how you do a masked character who s going to be the big bad in a trilogy.secondly his character is a rip off substitute for ben skywalker.  when he s all decked out he looks like the wish version of reven.i can see why he d want people to forget that  everything about it sucked.
i liked the new star wars
he was terrible in star wars.poor acting and was written like such a child in the movie in his reactions etc.very unrealistic and hardly counts as a frightening villain.
book of boba who cares
book of boba fett was terrible. completely ruined the character and many more.
ten was not a god character he has zero god fight scenes the faces he made when fighting looked stupid it s like the only jedi he studied was the emperor but ya there is nothing god that came out of new star wars dogg poo pile
ren was such an epic dissapointment. instead of a great villain  we got this crying emo kid. pathetic.
sorry  ur wrong. there s nothing good to come from new star wars.
disney star wars sucks!!!!!
i hated him as a star wars character.
whatever no one liked him or his made up character
kylo ren is a trash character. driver is a good actor  though.
he suck in star wars to all he did was cry the hole damn movie.. he was a forgettable character
kylo ren was not a strong character . he was a crybaby losser  who got his ass kicked twice by a trans woman
prequels   originals   sequels   shows and other movies
meh
if you really are a prequel fan  you should know how to pronounce  qui-gon jinn   adam driver is trash btw  worst character of the films aside from rey  and a crap actor
but it s ok if people like him... i ll live.
decent character  decent actor on an awful script!!  kylo ren sucks big time as the lowest-budget vader lol
you said what  kylo ren was the worst thing that happened to star wars  he was cry baby petulant child with zero control over his emotions.
melanie mac has come out as a religious fanatic and someone who doesn t like return of the jedi .that means he s not a real star wars fan.then again  she thinks the bible is scientifically accurate  so you have to question all her opinions.well  it s good that she is slightly cute. because that is the only way she s going to make it in life. unsubscribed.
quite frankly  he s a terrible actor. i won t be missing him.
i m a simp
