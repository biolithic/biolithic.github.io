I absolutely love how you are doing Bible verses at the end of your videos! as a fellow Christian gamer girl I fully support and encourage you doing this!!!!! 

really enjoyed your perspective. also happy to see someone in the gaming nerd culture so open about their faith. looking forward to the next one!

hello melonie! this Bible verse made me burst into tears two years ago.  I had a special moment with Christ and I love it!  thank you for sharing the verse with us.  I got watery eyes again today.  may the Lord light the way.

I love how you end your videos with a Bible verse and talking about the word. I am happy that jeremy put me onto you take care

I agree with your points melonie unfortunate turn of events. however thank you for the Bible verse. just found your channel. cheers

I love that you end the video with a Bible verse.

love the reflection  thank you for quoting the Bible  keep up the amazing work

hey this is the first video of yours Ive seen. I was shocked by the little Bible study at the end  but I absolutely loved it! thats incredibly bold of you to include like that  and I hope the Lord uses it. youre probably sick of this but what denomination are you  if you have one  or are you catholic  I assume not brethren since we dont normally have pastors. I dont ask so I can nitpick your beliefs  I just am always curious about it  so that I can understand where peoples reasoning comes from more fully. cant wait to meet you in heaven!

wow! great to see you end the video with a Bible verse. may God prosper you in your future endeavors.

I like you  I think I should subscribe. I lost my faith a little  and I like to see someone on yt who is not afraid to put Bible verses in videos that are not about religion. maybe this even helps me a little bit.

you have just inspired me so much as a Christian and as a person! I struggled with how to be open and share my faith but after seeing this vid I now gained some confidence! thank you so much!!

thank you for your perspective. and speaking openly about your faith  easy sub. keep up the great work!

keep up the good work!  jeremy had your back and thats how I found you. glad that happened!I ll go get the wheelbarrow  to help you carry the massive balls you have sharing your faith. what a rare thing these days.

a gamer and a Christian! ! I knew it was a good idea to subscribe.

I guess I was reminded of the struggle I have  but most importantly what you shared   especially those scriptures - because the word is what changes us right  - actually gave me a lot of encouragement and reassurance  after I processed it.  so thanks for putting that out there.  I know my position in Christ and I know that I am a sinner saved by grace through faith alone who unfortunately has this thing Im going to struggle with my whole life  and its already given me so much grief  or rather I have tried to take care of it on my own too many times instead of giving him my burden  and its bruised and battered me.  anyway - I appreciate what youre doing at the end of each episode.

love youre figuring out through your religion!  I do not share your beliefs  and dont care.  but your explanation is so true!
great video. just found your channel today. I am definitely going to check out more of them.

great video with a better ending  thank you. I had to learn the hard way when I was younger that you cant blame others for your mistakes. that you need to reflect upon yourself and need to take personal responsibility and realize that if you hadn t put yourself in thatsituation  it might not have happened.  no one is perfect  no one is sinless  no one is righteous but God and Jesus. you said it best  who needs Jesus more than the sick and sinners  I know I need Jesus! xd

preeeaaaach. Im so happy to have found a based gaming channel that is run by a Christian. so many are either atheist or agnostic  and they re fun to watch  but its just good to know Im not alone
