i think companies need to keep doing things like this so they can help me save my money.
i have no words.  reasons like this is why i wish japan still dominated the gaming industry.
in 2001 a game called oddworld  munch s  oddysee came out. the game featured optional wheelchairs that acted as essentially power ups for the sea dwelling protagonist while he was on dry land. finding a wheelchair would increase munch s overall speed and mobility in a way that worked well for the character and game.that s what being progressive without pandering looks like. it s rare but it happens.
they don t even have wheelchairs available yet
i ve been in stores that have a women s bathroom  and an all bathroom.  another store had women s  family  and an all bathroom. it seemed odd that there was no men s bathroom. don t forget to drink water.
you are brave woman for making a video about this.  i agree with you.
adding the hearing aids and glucose monitors is fine  and its nice they did that  but i dont think my sim would really need binders or anything if i can already freely alter their body shape
if you are trans  wouldn t the option of having a sim that is the sex you d wish to be be better than just simulating the struggles you are dealing with in the real world  why do you want to be  opressed  in the game as well
okay i ll say this  it s one thing if it s just modders doing this  but it s getting weird when the companies themselves do it.
the comment about the eating disorder really got me. i agree with everything you say  and wish you could get on national news and say these things! much respect for you saying the truth and talking about your faith. go boom!!
one of your best videos. really good points and with a positive message
next on sims   self-harm update to include all forms of self-expression
concerning the hearing aid and if anybody asked for it  yes. its a great adition to the game  especially to help younger kids accept their hearing aids as many struggle with this. and so when one creates their own family in sims  maybe together with their children  its just nice and inklusive to have those. it normalizes an everyday item that many kids struggle with accepting and dont want to wear to school kindergarden.
the woohoo s should be interesting! surprise bedroom mechanics!
loven the hoodie melonie. you look really good. blue looks amazing on you.
i understand the situation.  you are awesome melonie.  i love you .
if you think this is weird  just imagine what gaming in 2040 will be like
man  this whole trans trend is so pervasive that light switches aren t even safe.
accept me for how i am screamed the delusional person unable to accept themselves how they were born.
i think esrb should add the  blood and gore  category to the sims 4 rating  due to the depiction of mutilated body parts  scarring from  gender affirming  transition surgery  in this update. though i doubt that would happen since it would bump the rating to m.tbh  i think it is odd that esrb has only given the game the  crude humor    sexual themes       violence  catrgories. feels like there should be more categories assigned to this product like  partial nudity  for pixalated nudity and  sexual content  for woohoo.
right  i haven t watched movies since end game
problem is the new generation will think this is normal that s there goal
@ianwest1624  they re playing the long game.. they re after our children   not us
the last dlc i bought was get famous back on the xbox one. since then i have moded the sims 2 to hell and back and have thoroughly enjoyed myself.
lol dude  nice.
good on sony for helping your parents save money. hopefully you get a job soon.
@youarebait9609  projection looks good on you  you should accessorize with other insecurities.
selfish...  shame!
big facts
good sh_t
game is free now
@707romo707  you abstained from all movies damn that s kind of hardcore not really but it is still funny
i get the point you re trying to make but if you didn t own the sims 4 by now there is probably nothing they could have added that would have changed your mind how many years has they came been out for again i get your point but it s ring pretty hallow when basic knowledge of the product is applied
@youarebait9609  lol
we can t have nice things
good thing that sims 4 is free now since hell no would pay for this shit
society already thinks that its cancer.
@ianwest1624  that s not their goal at all. their goal is always money . and they think this is where the money is at  and they re right. plastering  progressive  symbolisms onto their brand and pandering to those demographics clearly brings them more money than if they didn t  at least in the west. that s why they do the things they do. same reason why disney caters to china to maintain its access to the huge and lucrative chinese market. same reason why bmw america europe twitter accounts change their profile pic to a rainbow logo during pride month but bmw middle east doesn t. it s capitalism at play. simple as that.
@emilyalucard1055  sims 4 is as basic as sims ever has been.i don t see how propaganda effects it much its just basic sims.it always gets boring after awhile so maybe thats the issue.
@707romo707  and you only watched it to see how it would end. right
@monkeywatch4916  this ea we re talking about. it s always about money with them.
i am now 10 months away from home ownership. thanks sony  for your censorship rules!
@leinad2934  there is no money here dude. simple as that. all this stuff is failing. there was never money here. that s why bros flopped. you re way off the mark.
the only thing that matters is gay. this is 2023  c mon
because that would take actual work creating new animations and whatnot. creating binders and top surgery scars is much easier in comparison. they don t add new gameplay funcitonality  that s the rub. it s all surface level changes without any substance.
don t worry  there s a big push from the same community to get those as well.
the reason why they don t have wheelchairs is because the game isn t designed arround them  they d have to completely rework the whole game  terrine  maps  buildings  pathing etc  just to make them function properly  that s not even talking about the rigs they d have to make for the sims. tl dr   it s just cheaper to add in cosmetic changes than to go in and rework the game.
@cerulee  that last part is what s truly insulting imho  it s not that all the woke shit is being added to the game  although it is an annoyance  is that it feels all surface level  hollow and shallow. like it s only being done to get inclusively points from the woke mob and to  trend  to the kids and adults who are on board with the  crowd .
why would a crippled child want to fantasize about being crippled  i would think they would dream about being healthy  able to run and play.
@hiraghm  everyone misses the point that sims are about making a bunch of sims... they aren t all youself
@hiraghm  there are some people who write stories using their sims  i was one of them  and i had a sim that i had sit in a custom content wheelchair to pretend he was disabled
@sonoftheredfox8921  ea will never do it. too much work.
@brightwulph  yea you re right. they don t even fix bugs that ruin some aspects of the game. they for sure are not going to add a bunch of features for disabilities
@hiraghm  yea  i get your point.
@foximoxi8533  for real  so many features have been broken for a long time and will probabbly never be fixed.
@hiraghm  that s my thought process when it comes to the diabetes one. they just added diabetes to the game . like wtf
or cars  for that matter.
facts!!
i m in a wheelchair and that doesn t offend me at all  and i ve been playing sims games since the first one. imagine if i called for a boycott and said it was ableist. i wouldn t do that though because i don t care  i m not a lunatic leftist.
@mayberry64  lol dude chill  under normal circumstances i d agree with you  but literally nobody here is being a lunatic leftist. we all agree  let s chill with that. save it for where it actually matters.
@hotcheetogirl_  you re right  i was talking about the people that do freak out. i wasn t referring to anyone here at this time. sorry.
@mayberry64  lol that s okay don t apologize
@hotcheetogirl_  thanks for being understanding
i almost certain there was one that makes no sense unless its an architect or building error.
i was just about to say this. i don t see the point of adding a transgender option in video games. if you want to play as a girl than just play as a girl. same thing as playing as a boy. why the transgender option  your still gonna be treated whatever your preffered gender is. i just don t get it....
i totally agree with this. if parents want to ban their kids from the sims over this  that is their choice. i think a smarter move would be to talk to your kids about the issue as a whole and explain how you feel about it and what role it plays in your family. i also think this would--with old enough children--be a good time to explain that talking about this must be done with care because there are some people out there trying to take kids away from their parents over this  which is very dangerous.
because all of those people are miserable and want everyone else to be miserable with them.
the sad part is  there was already an option to make trans characters. ea is just sad.
@sonoftheredfox8921  that doesn t even make sense how would they be making other people miserable and what correct me if i m wrong i haven t played the sims since the ps2 is a single player game
i think its more for a role-playing issue  because let s be honest- players love to do stories within the game. it doesn t need to be a story about oppression  just a sweet story about learning to be yourself.also  it could be used as a comformation that there is nothing wrong with being transgender.
you are correct the fact is most trans folks when given the choice to make a character in a video game will just make the gender that they are mentally and emotionally ann s video games are in escapists medium and can allow us to become well really anything and can take our physical limitations or physical flaws and erase them and instead we get cool fireball powers or the ability to ride dragons you know cool stuff like that the kind of people who do things like this and just assume that identification relatability comes from completely matching has probably never actually spoken to a trans person or a gamer for that matter which doesn t surprise me considering this is ea as far as the other stuff like the hearing aid or the i think it was glucose indicator whatever the heck if memory serves the sims is the videogame equivalent of playing with barbie dolls so i think those could theoretically offer more storylines for a potential players imagination and heck you could argue the same thing for the transitions although i think those should be limited only to adults if what melanie says is true then there are trans options for teen sims which i don t think is okay
@angelphoenix7784  what was it excatly
@funpolishfox5410  what make a trans character
@emilyalucard1055  when it comes to tranagender kids  it s important to consult with mental health specialist and be aware of your children behaviour. some people let kids transition socially  so they can better understand if they really are transgender.again  you can start transition if you are teen  nothing wrong with that  but it is important to consult the right person.
@angelphoenix7784  you aren t answering my question.what option was this excatly  what it was  tell me.
@funpolishfox5410  as a trans person myself no it is not okay to do any form of medical transitioning while under the age of legal adulthood heck i don t even think you should have 18 cuz let s be real most 18 through i d say 21 year olds mentally are still high schoolers just trying to figure out the very basics of the real world socially transitioning is one thing that anybody can choose to do their own volition but anything involving medical is a decision that should be made entirely by an adult of their own volition and based on their own personal self-reflection
@funpolishfox5410  i don t think you really want to know. you don t play sims 4. i ll only answer this once and only once. you understand in the cc  you can make your character male or female  you then click on the three dots next to the character lines  under that you can claim whatever sex you want. next  if you make a male  you can change the voice to female  by going higher  lower if you want a female with male voice. with mods you can adjust the bust size.now i answered your question. i know you aren t a gamer let alone one that doesn t play the sims  otherwise you would have never asked how to make a trans character  you would have already know.
@emilyalucard1055  that s excatly why i m saying to consult with the right people.it s just better to understand things and have guidance  even if you don t start transition.and that s why i was talking about social transition- it just helps to understand things better for someone.you don t need to start hormone therapy or take puberty blockers. and don t worry- even taking those won t fuck you up that much  when you re young  with the right guidance.talking from a perspective of someone with biology and medical knowledge.
@angelphoenix7784  i m gamer and play the sims since the beginning of the the sims 3  just i spent most time in the build buy mod  so i forgot about it  lol.buy yeah  thanks for answering mate.
@funpolishfox5410  no i don t think you are. if you were  you would have done a search on how to. not come to a random youtuber that just happened to have a video about the sims  and come across one random person who talked about it. that does not occur.
@angelphoenix7784  i played sims 2  3  medieval and 4. i came to this video  because i was interested what was wrong with new update.there weren t any platforms before the snowy escape pack  spa day had refresh and sims 4 just has terrible gameplay  but good b b mod. i wasn t playing the sims for some time and when i started again  i was just builiding  because gameplay is lackluster as shit.i asked to the question  because i was just curious and you were right  there are options like this.i still remember days when we didn t have toddlers. i know by heart motherlode  rosebud and bb.moveobjects. i tried to use whicked whims and extreme violence.and tbh  the medical stuff and transgender things are for role-play reasons  to build a story. to flesh out the story  even tho  it can t fix shitty gameplay.
bri they definitely want to be oppressed in the game too. they get off on it.
as a trans if i ever wanted to be represented in a game i just choose  female  because that is who i am on the inside and have been working to bring that onto my outside self. i am all for trans representation but this is just...idk..it feels kinda disgusting idk how to explain it
because some people like to play as who they actually are  or make characters the same as they actually are. it s just a small addition to a life simulator game that people play however they want. stop getting so triggered and loosing your shit about it lmao
they love the victim badge. feed off the pity.
@jackbrealey1999  fr lmao
exactly
well that s the thing  they don t see breast scars and things of that nature as a struggle or oppression. they re badges of honor to them. these people need help  they re not right in the head.
@kathycoleman4648  agree. based
pandering  pandering  and more pandering
because they are obsessed with their  struggle
i thought the same thing.
good point. it s very stupid. i m a woman  but i often play as male characters. not because i m trans or anything i just like them better. i don t see why they can t do the same thing.
shh. stop making sense
it s a life simulator  life has struggles and sims is always trying its best to represent the struggles of life  not everyone plays sims as copium mechanism  some just want to build their big imperfect world  because ours is imperfect  otherwise people like you wouldnt exist.
yeah if your goal with your transition is to not be passable  then you re not trans.
a lot of people that play the sims don t create themselves but create characters and stories. it s not just about creating yourself but creating others as well.
what about this is so hard to understand  they just added more options that s it. a transgender person can either play as their preferred sex  or as a trans character if that s what they want. the sims is a life simulator. more options is better than less options. you guys are offended by small elements of the game that you can easily just ignore. it s a video game. you can shoot civilians and cops and blow stuff up in gta. don t tell me having an option to be a transgender in a life simulator of all genres is somehow worse for children than that.
i don t know. i m not trans. and since the game does not oppress sims  the question as phrased is kind of silly.
i m here to answer the op lol  the addition of breast scars is something for trans individuals to see themselves within the game. the update also added in glucose monitors beacuse people have these things. sims is like playing dolls. real life has people with these issues and available to live life fine  medical procedures doesn t equate to trauma lol. i have quite a few scars upon me from my poor health and i d love to see more additions to scars. again  sims is like dolls  you tell story s and why wouldn t you want to see yourself in the things you play with  it s like saying there shouldn t be barbie dolls with wheelchairs or braces beacuse oh no people don t wanna play with disabilities!!
there already was the option to have female sims pee standing up while being able to impregnate or be impregnated. they had something that would have allowed transgender players to play out the fantasy in game.
i know right 0_o! 3 patches ago they added pronouns. and that patch took up 8 gigs 0_o!
@damackism  at least we can have sims whose pronouns are  your majesty  and   your highness  now.
@eatwave  good point.
@volundrfrey896  that s exactly my point. we all know it s just options. so why are these snowflakes crying over options that they can simply choose to not participate in   things i don t like exist and i want them gone
@mikaele3137  i think one of the issues many have with this and related issues is too many it seems to be normalizing and glorifying etc mutilation of the body
@dragonlordess1  yep!
@icylights33  i m sure there s lots in life you  don t get
thank you so much for this
yes. all of this is of two minds. if the goal is to center what should  be  perceived as normal  adding any emphasis to disabilities goes against that. if the goal is to allow peopple to express who they truly are  we absolutely need those options. by all means  sit down with your kids in front of the sims with this new update and--gasp--talk. but suggesting that if we hide things that they and the people they represent will go away is wrong.
i agree  no offense to the creator but she was stretching with the hearing aids and glucose monitor. her take seems kind of half-baked especially because a lot of people have been asking for this stuff including other things like vitiligo options.  besides the obvious stuff being cars and babies . she doesn t seem like a simmer to me at all.
@indigo3896  they haven t even added wheel chairs. surely that s more important than glucose monitors and hearing aids.
@indigo3896  she could be a sim player  just not sims 4. i love the sims  but i think sims 4 sucks and is a major step back from sims 3. sims 2 castaway  sims 2 ps2  sims 3 and sims medieval are my favourites.
@geraltofrivia22  i should have probably specified in my comment by saying  specifically  for the sims 4 since she s talking about it. but if i m being honest  ea has done some terrible company moves with this franchise and  respectfully  they dropped this stuff without hyping it up or confusing ppl into thinking it was something  bigger   ie  cars   so the hearing aids and glucose monitors don t disappoint me for those reasons. false promises like hinting at free  cool gameplay or things the community has been asking about for years  but instead recycling items from old stuff packs is what does it for me.
yes. how long before another sim jumps out of the bed screaming in terror because they didn t realize their girlfriend came equipped with a penis. to be clear  if two people get together  are honest  and accept each other  awesome sauce. but i don t know how the heck you d cover that in a sims aspect  and if nothing else that sequence would be funny in a silly cartoon mechanism. remember  friends  you know who has power over you based on who you cannot cite in jest.
hopefully before that we all come to our senses
probably played with rocks and sticks out in the ruins of former cities the way things are going.and the kids with 3 eyes and 4 arms will have a definite advantage regardless of gender.
@manco65  lol sounds like you playing fallout
dead
@hackeysacked  nope never played it but i ve a soft spot for weird post apocalyptic movies on youtube and tubi
@manco65  ha ha ha kids existing at all
@manco65  play it then and stop wasting time on dumb apocalypse movies
people are finally open about being transgender and more people are aware  because its safe...  this is trend...! history  what s that
@apocalypse6157  i mean  that this isn t trend. people are just open more about it  because its safe.history shows how it wouldn t be safe in the past.i hope  this time i wrote that better.
@funpolishfox5410  yeah and you re right but history also shows that it wasn t safe to be a woman either and in a lot of countries and in some ways it still isn t safe for either. anyways  i m calling it a trend because it quite literally is a trend. as you said more people are becoming more open about being trans. i mean no insult in the use of the term and only time will tell if this trend ends up being a fad or if it will have a more long-term impact on our way of life.
@apocalypse6157  using the word is just kinda bad imo.trend sounds wrong when talking about something like this. being transgender isn t trend  its just... well  being.but yeah  i m happy we are mostly understanding each other.
@funpolishfox5410  the huge rise in teen girls deciding to transition would suggest it is  very much  a trend.
@funpolishfox5410  it s both  some are coming out as trans because they aren t scared of social stigma anymore  but at the same time  it definitely is a trend.
agreed
they want you to accept them for who they are yes and not be a dickhead to them. remember the phrase  if you don t have anything nice to say don t say it at all   we were all taught it as kids. as were my parents so it s nothing new. just cause you don t agree with someone s decision doesn t mean you get free pass to treat them as less than a person
@mrgerr454   a great comment i once read went   if you can t accept yourself for who you really are  i m certainly not going to accept you for who you are pretending to be. the thing is  we do accept  transgenders  for who they really are. it s they who are refusing to accept themselves for who they really are. they insist on pretending to be someone and something they are not and never will be.and frankly  if  not being a dickhead  to someone means you have to participate in their fantasy and deny reality for them  i would much rather be a  dickhead . i m not willing to deny science or reality for anyone  and calling me names like  dickhead  is just going to make me even more unwilling.
i agree with you sir
i really hope this isnt also directed at gay people.
esrb doesn t follow the rules they where made to do they play ball with those who brib them
@mrgerr454  me refusing to entertain a delusion doesn t mean i m treating them less than a person. i don t go out of my way to yell at trans people and harass them. i just refuse to let them force me into accepting their lie. you are completely disingenuous if you think that i m treating them less than human because i won t play their infantile game of pretend.
@chandllerburse737  no  in fact i wish the lgb community wouldn t let the t group shoehorn their way in alongside them.
@theviewbot  yeah they can t even have a full rainbow flag. seems like every year it gets smaller and smaller.
@trevie7589  odd your pfp pic is trevor who is either bisexual or insanely pansexual lol
@trevie7589  wow what a worthwhile conversation its legit like i just spoke to a twitter user.you just come here to troll  lol
i actually like the hearing aid and glucose part  mainly because it gives more option to make more unique sims and the hearing aid is the nice for the elder sims because they have been seriously neglected  not even a bloody walking-stick.. i whant my darn walking stick! xdalso. they have released a basicly drag pack  but that is something you would have to opt into buying  not a forced update to base-game.
removing that ladder while the sim is in the pool is just going to jump that 41  up higher.
glad i got into and played the sims as a teen in a time before this all took off.
feeling cute and ...     whenever people feel the need to write on social media that they re  feeling cute   you can bet they re the exact opposite of that.
there is to be no escapism.  the narcissists must be represented in all things at all times or else they re going to cause problems.
honestly the big push for this has been in the last 18-24months it seems. before all sims were pansexual  and no one cared much really...  but then someone wanted a  gay  sim who refuses any heterosexual advances and down the career rabbithole of insanity they went. when they ll come back out  nobody knows.
new idea for my woke tomb raider video. laura croft slowly morphs into lee croft by the end of the episode. it s going to be a hit. maybe even a race swap. there you go  laura croft morphs into black lee.
it s not always a good thing to substitute your lightswitch with an electrical outlet. you might get a shock.
oh yes! the community of sims has asked  over and over  for hearing aids and wheelchairs and such!! it s a very wierd community. i am not one who has asked.
they ve been doing the pronouns thing for a while and even have the kids and adults dress wild before you edit it.
can we just all agree. this isn t being done to be tolerant  it s being done to appease the woke mob.
being a simmer the fact that they gave us this transgender update before even giving us proper functioning babies  vehicles or even walking canes for elders  which being a life simulation  game should have all of these attributes since the majority of the people have or relate to these things  the company decides to cater to a miniscule minority to push an agenda of self mutilation because it s trendy  speaks volumes for the company s true intentions.
hey  melonie. hope you re having a great day. can t remember the last time i played a sims game  but  really  so ridiculous. used to be the sims was a kids game mostly
keep up the good work!
that s why i still play skyrim and only watch old movies
the sims has been doing this kind of thing for a while now  so this is not surprising at all! i don t play the sims anymore  but i was a massive fan of the sims 2 and always will be.
2 27 just like in the real world  truly immersive
i haven t played the sims in years and the last time i played they introduced an option where you could customise your gender but it was never as bad as it is now and i thought the update was satire because i thought they wouldn t go this far and i was shocked when i found out that it was real and i don t think wanna play the sims ever again
companies are basically trying to make a quick buck at this point. protecting themselves from being cancelled at the same time. they re trying to include everything and everyone.
anyone who doesn t think these people have an agenda are in denial.
a walking stick will not make your sim gandalf.
@hiraghm  thats why we have spellcasters
they can climb out the sides now. you d have to enclose the pool with a wall or fence instead. our favorite sim murder made slightly less convenient...
when was the last time you played sims dude  that hasnt worked in years lol
@skelliosiss  maybe when it was a fun game with no need for politics
@tyyung7666  it is a videogame

@skelliosiss  sims 3 is still better than sims 4.
they don t want you or your children to have any respite.
i kinda dont mind the gay only option  feels right  just as it would be ok for there to be sims who wouldnt take gay advances... maybe a system to identify  or locations like gay bars to know which of the few only take gay or straigth or bi.... but this trans thing is just too much  the game has way more to worry about to simulate life. theres literally no drums or stuff in it  its priorities are messed up.
it s been a while since i played it  but i remember sims 2 sims had a preference  but you could change or strengthen it with social actions. ignoring one sex and focussing on the other would set the preference. i don t know if that gameplay mechanic was continued in the newer sims.
we all agree with this. because if they were really tolerant they would add more things for poc characters. they know the lgbt community will be louder and can get their game canceled.
it s being done because it s easier to do this than it is to fix the bugs and simulation lag.
i ve been saying this for years  the only started  caring  once the wokies started to pester them on their social media to  include  this stuff. i m very upset to see a franchise  which was known for being super open and caring slowly devolve into  well not a cest pool quite yet  but into something that is quite concerning. one bright side is that a number of other simmers have begun to realise that the current community is becoming very   toxic  but unfortunately  as more and more youngsters take over the game said over fans are kind of pushed out and their concerns are shouted down. it s quite sad  glad i left the community a year ago and never looked back.
literally cuz it s been this way since the update that let you change body type and put female clothes on male sims and male clothes on female sims
it always is.
10000  agree. we know they are no good liberals now. dont buy sims
to be fair the sims has always tried to include everyone. i wouldn t really say it is for the woke mob.
i just wish they would fix the action queue and that it didn t take me 2 hours to eat a sandwich
this game is a big downgrade from sim3 except from the mood function and graphic
dude this is basically bethesda they give people microtransactions before fixing the dev room bug.
@edikmkm6210  gen z is still mostly kids.and its great people still blame this on the youngest generation when older people are the ones in charge of these companies and country
sims 3 is still better by far.
a mob  they may scream but that s it literally.
@roluevasreisa5730  adding dwarves or the handicapped into this game would make more sense than adding transgender people. being a transgender is to get attention period. its not like a dwarve or migit became that way by choice. you might as well tell the sims creators to start adding furries. people who think they are fucking cats
@lemonzest666  funny  i can say the same about you since you seem to have enough time to filter through other people s opinions and call them names.
@roluevasreisa5730  would be even better if it was just basic male and female of all ages and adjust height and stuff for preference
@blitzhunts3433  im ok with that i love dwarves i love height differences ans i love size play
elder scrolls 6 is going to let you play as a skooma addict that identifies as a cheese wheel.
oh nooooo todd how could you.
ah yes skyrim.blandest greyest rpg thats still being re released.when are you gonna upgrade to new vegas
@surlyunicorn9461  if it ever gets released.
pronouns  females peeing while standing and females getting males females pregnant wasn t enough oh no  no no no
if only there were any patterns to recognize..
i always thought they just wanted to appease them to get more game sales
the question is do you know who  these people  actually are
@gorishidan  i literally just made a comment on their page about the lgbt community getting more in the game than poc because they know that if the lgbt community stops playing the game and makes enough noise they lose more money.
@paralyt1c  polticians  activists  writers   creative  types  journalists.
@paralyt1c  the same people jesus kicked out of the temple.
why is this a big deal in the sims but not in hogwarts legacy
@marquezdaniel  don t get me started on hogwarts
trans people have been around for years   but this intense media focus on it is a relatively new phenomenon that came about almost overnight. the powers that be decided it was time to start what is basically massive pr push   for whatever reason.
just started playing wow dragonflight last night and was amazed i already saw multiple gay dragons and a trans dragon. just watched the last of us and it had a gay romance episode  it s infesting everything i like! i then woke up to this news!
what s next  they gonna add a sex change operation update. im surprised that hasn t happen yet.
the pause you did at 15 47 had me rolling. sadly  this kind of stuff is just par for the course at this point.
for a long time in sims 4  in default the majority of male npcs walking around the world have the shoulders slider set to narrowest and have wide hips  while half the female npcs have that shoulder slider set to max and they have no hips or breasts. except for black npc where they tend to give them normal human bodies. the point is the players could already make whatever body shape they want  they didn t need this extra thing and instead more work was needed to fix problems like household data corruption
just found your channel love your rants
correct me if i m wrong but the sims it s essentially the videogame equivalent to playing with barbie dolls from my understanding so like wouldn t having a bunch of different options for potential storylines in your made-up fantasyland barbie doll world or equivalent to the vet and a video game be a good thing for people who enjoy this kind of game as with more options like all the medical stuff you talk about would not be opening the door to more potential storylines in someone s personal gameplay experience
one thing about the sims add-ons  they also cause problems  and can be highly distracting.  like the pet addition  your pets are sick all of the time  and you are always going to the veterinarian.  the seasons update altered the game so much that some achievements are hard to complete  such as the wilderness adventures  because you are seasonal.
and all of my interest in sims 4 went out the window.
i am glad i have been boycotting ea for years.
i see what you mean and i also understand the comments saying   why wouldn t you just choose the gender you prefer. why would you want the problems and strugles you have in real life in the game too.  but many people wanna play the sims in a realistic way and make it as real as it can be so  adding such an update is pretty good in my opinion. the people who wanna play with it can buy it and everybody else can just ignore it. so why judge it. many people struggle with those things and have a hard time accepting themself and playing their favourit game and seeing that it is normal to be on a journey and not completely in the position you want to be is okay  may helps them. so please don t judge things without thinking about others and how it could actually help them. thank you!
i totally agree with you. like your videos  greetings from germany. keep going and stay st
gonna need one of those ps hoodies for myself.
i know who i m locking in the basement and proceeding to burn the house down with now
as if ea could sink any lower
knowing ea  i am beyond surprised they did not charge for that. every little thing they throw into the mtx shop  seems like it would have made them   .
thanks for always bringing attention to this stuff  melonie. it takes a lot of guts to speak out. i ll always be here to support you.
lotus eaters just did an incredible interview with a detransitioner
jeremy and ryan are going to play side by side.    fight each other too.
i m diabetic wheelchair bound  wheelchairs are rumored to be coming  lol  and deaf but my conditions were caused at birth not by choice to alter my body. i don t plan on using any of these devices in game but hey if others want to use it w e players probably know someone irl with these conditions whether acquired at birth or as part of the normal aging process as there are  millions more affected by them but yeah the trans stuff is certainly a bit of a hot potato
@tyricegadson7699  ok but my point is why is melonie making a big deal about this but not about hogwarts legacy which pretty much has the same things in character creation  it just comes off as hypocritical because she s basically looking past that because it doesn t fit her other narrative about the game which is the whole jk rowling drama.
@marquezdaniel  hogwarts legacy is a new game  the sim isn t and the sim doesn t really need this up date.hogwart legacy doesn t either but sense it new they can just add as part of the start of the game core which is why they did.the sims doing this now at this point is just a stunt for money and it s to plain obvious.
@gekkokkid  well that s not really a good argument because aren t all these games trying to make money. why do all these games add new battle passes and new character customizations  every so often  to make more money but since they added transgender characterizations now it s a problem  yeah that doesn t add up.
@marquezdaniel  there s no makeup on males option in hl nor the option of chest surgery. you can choose gender and that s it. the males still look male  the females still look female
@user-ld2vu2qi8p  not from what i ve seen also ign has set it themselves that there s a hug amount of gender diversity and you know how ign and the big media outlets are sensitive about that so stop making excuses for melonie you stan lol
is it like you re gonna die if there is transgender people in videogames  you re not trans  not attracted to trans  wow  big news  can they live in peace and be represented  or are you gonna cry   i mean  i need an explanation ffs
@pok stonksonlygoup or worse  they have an agenda themselves...
@marquezdaniel  because that s just how some people are i truly do believe melanie has a good heart and on some level has good intentions but she is motivated entirely by personal bias he s emotional investment and what she perceives to be the right thing to do for her perceived side in an imaginary you fight created by people who simply want to make mountains of molehills there are legitimate issues that s society the games industry the film industry the doll industry the food industry etc etc face both structurally and culturally and there s nothing wrong with trying to bring like to real issues but when you go out of your way to create fights draw lines in the sand and attack people 4 problems you create in your own mind you do nothing even close to helping anyone and you will eventually at the critically when it comes time to do the same to something you enjoy like i said i don t think melanie is a bad person i just don t believe she thinks very much about what she actually is doing how she acts conducts herself or communicates her message
@martingarnier8009  that really is how a lot of these people act honestly tbh even as a small child i never understood the pleasure some people get out of being mean to people who are different from them like you know when you re a kid that s just another person and it doesn t feel good to be mean and when you re an adult that s another adult with their own life paying their own bills making their own choices what possible earthly benefit or wasting your own time being a jerk hateful or otherwise cruel
@goodmorningpokey majority of people are idiots  only a few are bless with morals.most are just trying to stay alive than living life.
@marquezdaniel  i myself am a christian as well and over the last maybe year-and-a-half to two years of my life i ve become very disillusioned with my fellow christians the way i ve seen them treat other people both in and out of the faith  treated me and generally behave it has been a true struggle and at times i ve even thought that it may have damaged my faith the center of my faith does still remain a belief in christ and a belief in his sacrifice and message but my disillusionment with my fellow christians has certainly hurt me personally i would like you to know that it really touched my heart what you brought here and i generally thank you reminding what a christian should act like through your actions and words it really means a lot thank you very very much  i wish you would truly blessed day thank you again
some sure but its more or less corporations virtue signaling for potential profit.
@gekkokkid  so because this is an update its stunt didn t people also say cyberpunk and other games with start game transgender options were also a stunt if anything its all done for profit to help associate these people even most of them know it dude.
@emilyalucard1055  shes a christian and i feel that fuels it which i guess should as a christian myself i am struggling with belief and i both disagree with her audience and some of her sayings but at the same time it makes me wonder if i am somehow damned for not believing the same severeness as her.of course i am a gen z and i am just tired of being told that my generation is the end and my life is apparently short its already been so bad because of myself lol.and melonie is a firm reassurer in the idea that this stuff is gonna be the end of us soon.
@normanreaddis  i mean most who try to stay alive have little choice.many are in poverty many are starving many are poor children being the only thing between them and their family and starvation.most in the world are underprivileged unfortunate and quite frankly almost dead every day.
@chandllerburse737 and they re the best subjects for exploitation.  if you can find a group of people that s willing to victimize themselves  you can make them permanent voters .only few people are salvageable when judgment comes. all people are gonna be weight on after this run. so better think about the actions you do. there s always a choice if everyone allows it tho everything is possible but not all are morally right. we live in a world of living out of somebody else s needs just to be alive. we re never gonna prosper if the civilizations most catered to is crab mentality and narcissism.
but for real this is a stupid af update
i agree with some of that  but i refuse to play without seasons.
thing is  they basically already had this feature with voice sliders and body shape sliders but i guess it wasn t woke enough lol
it s inferior to the sims 3 anyway.
i boycotted them after i was done with mass effect 3 s dreadfully disappointing dlc-free ending which even its multiple choices lead to the same demise literally. that is when i knew how avaricious they truly became.
the reason i don t play the sims 4 always love older the sims from 2000 s.
@toastedplants518  it is though
the whole package for the sims 4 in more than 500 bucks
@lecuistotdepzbiensur1298  huh  still cheaper than the doa6 mtx.
@rosekindred  true
but why does she bring it up only for the sims but not hogwarts legacy which also lets you choose to be a transgender.
@marquez daniel  you still have to choose rather ur a which or wizard. male or female pretty much
all of this simply drives me into the arms of pirated older games and emulation.
the sims has always been about representation. play how you want to play  however  i do think parental control is essential.
i knew that people had trouble with their sims killing themselves but the rate is gonna go way up with that update !
awsome. another game on my ignore list. woke saveing me money every day.
the walls and pools with no ladders shall flow like wine. none shall escape their new tombs.
so the people who made sims no longer want money got it.
i actually think parents should use this huge trans push to teach their kids about important lessons in life.  see boy  these people are what we used to call incels or  un-effables  . we should take this opportunity to teach kids about the dangers of becoming social pariahs and how to avoid it.
alright! just what i always wanted  to be able to change my character s appearance and gender back and forth.
i think there would be videos of people doing horrible things to these pc npc characters. like trapping them in a non escapable areas 1x1box building  hole or pool and houses with no doors. there s a litany of videos of that on youtube.
me after a melonie mac video    great video thank you!
i remember playing the first sim game back in the day good times like when i would get bored and lured them into the pool and delete the ladders but after sims 2 i was so disappointed with how much was taken out and sold back as dlc. but all these additions seem odd and kind beyond niche
i will wait for dinosaur  dog  cat advanced helicopter dlc when it comes out  d
and this is why it s better to just mod the sims 2.prove me wrong please
the last thing this game  or any game  needs is to have a life-altering decision pushed on children and young adults like this. why is it so difficult for people to have ideologies and not force them onto everyone else !
i ll keep the hat going  good job!  all my 4 kids grew up playing that game  fond memories of what they created.  keep shining that light! go
unless my sim can have a hearing aid trumpet from the 1700s  then i am fine.
while the game may rated  teens  we all know that younger people will be playing it. as long as the parent buys it for them they can play at any time.
i swear every update these gaming companies puts out just keeps getting worse
as someone who does sims videos it s hard because you can t even say how you really feel if you disagree with it
oh my goodness  where did you get that sweater  i need it!
exactly it s the pirate life for me
i m actually building up a huge collection of emulators and roms while watching this  nothing drives me harder into retro gaming than witnessing all these modern gaming crazy shenanigans
yep me too  games used to be more about gameplay and less about social engineering
i don t get how these dudes can t get any
my dude incels and transgender folks are two groups that don t really cross over
lol!
@emilyalucard1055  finally  someone here with common sense.
@funpolishfox5410
it s hard to teach them to not become a social pariahs when you are a big one yourself  take a look in the mirror and a sip of good sense  because you of all people shouldn t be dictating who s socially disfunctional or not.
@user-ez8gj8uy8j  if you re talking about me  i ve never been socially dysfunctional in my entire life. i grew up in a non-connected world. we actually had to speak with people face-to-face. imagine that  oooo....scary  huh  i can imagine your anxiety building after reading that last line  huh  holy crap!!! you couldn t be a keyboard warrior when there was no keyboard!!! i bet you re about to flip through your contacts to call your therapist to demand an emergency session.not everyone has your mental illness. stop projecting. disconnect for once. it ll do you some good. go outside and touch grass.
i mean  this is just a cool gameplay feature  even for cis folks.
@funpolishfox5410  no it really isn t
@mrmistah1588  why
thank you so much!
you are afraid of getting canceled  just do it and maybe it even helps you to clean your followers
@nbmad  problem is the sims has a very progressive audience. it s mostly teen and young adult females with very left views.
i ve noticed the more recent barbie fashionista dolls and this year s lego friends reboot have also introduced characters with hearing aids and various other disabilities.
love the video and i agree with you 100 . also not sure if its just me but the audio for the video seems a bit low.
i m diabetic and i think that sims characters could be diabetics it s the most unnecessary idea. it could be like  hard mode  though
longer text  because here in germany  we have a cool trans influencer. writing a bit about her later here. she has an opinion about that  and woke people hate her for that.i liked the sims  especially the sims 3. but the sims 4  i have it  but i would have to buy add ons  and i don t want too to expensive. but sims 3 was cool.i made a lot of crazy and evil clowns. i made mages  who burned clowns. i had all sorts of cruel or crazy sims. that was fun...to this here  yeah  the puberty blockers harm. you won t get a beard and anything like that. i have a tumor  that produced hormons  you would get with puberty blockers  too. i got it with maybe 9. had it 12 years without medication. and i was  lucky   because it stopped me grwoing with around 13 and 5 10  so 175cm. just 3 or 4 inch in the 5 years after that  to 6 1. with 21 they found out and i got medication  6 weeks later i was around 6 3.it had a few impacts. for example the bone structure is different. if it s the face  especially compared to brothers  it s finer. hands and nails aswell. so you could say  that is ok  but there still are problems with body hair. it s less than it should be. pans and suits are difficult. the pelvis. and to be clear  it was  just  1 hormon  and i was extremly lucky. and the puberty blockers are far worse. it can be bad for bones  for muscles. hair. maybe you can t get children. a lot of stuff like that. even worse  if they get hormons. because we have the first people that want to re-transition. they say  they wanted to be special or were talked into that. so you have  for example  women with facial hair. i know a case  she was 7 years a man  2 years later still problems. even without surgery it has a lot of consequences. they to it to fast.in want to share the opinion of a trans woman here in germany on youtube. woke people hate her. for her the transition went pretty good. but she says  first of all  people should accept it as mental illness  and she is glad it s accepted as that  because that s why insurance pays.she also described  how it is  if you are really trans. it s not like you feel like the opposite gender. it s more like  what makes you your gender  genitals and so on  causes feelings as if it would be for example a parasite. something extremly disgusting and harmful  that eats you. she says  if it s like that  some people would do it by their own  if they don t get surgery. but she also says  it seems like  a lot of new trans people aren t really trans. there are some  they have no problem with certain things on their body. they just take hormons. she says  people who keep their p nis and are fine with that aren t trans. some people harm their bodies for different reasons. like cutting. some of them enjoy it especially  if others do it. other people just take hormons or make things like that  to get jobs or some social benefits. she found people  for example a person  who had no success with woman. seems like that was the reason for the transition  because a lot of things he says aren t something that would fit. others become activists. she says  for sure a lot of narcissists do it for attention and to be appreciated. there are mulltiple types of personality disorders. and some  especially young people  are talked into that. or want to be special. and regret later. or do it for sports.in her opinion it s extremly harmful  how fast they allow the transition. and that they don t admit what it changes. forever. because it s harmful for real trans people  if they are associated with others  who just use it for their personal  often times harmful goals. she doesn t have problems with people seeing  she is trans  because her transition went extremly well  but even she had hormons with around 20 or something like that. adult for sure. so she is an example for  you don t need it that early.she says  in her opinion there should be some things  first. before transition. for example psycho therapy. and finding out  it s really being trans or something else  it s that strong that they want to get rid of some body parts  because in such a case  what else should you do  if they would do it alone otherwise  but a lot of them keep it. a lot of them just like dresses. or colors. she says  a lot of people just have a fet sh. or they are insecure.she is a reasonable person  and she wants to really educate and inform people  especially about being trans  and about narcissists. about all the woke stuff  and why it s harmful. about public figures  who claim to be trans  and use it in different ways to reach goals. about all the true things  activists don t want you to know. that trans people are far stronger than women. if it s the upper part of the body  in average a man is 2x as strong as a woman. reflexes are faster aswell. legs usually are around 3x stronger. and she as a trans women still is at least 1 5 times stronger  compered to women. legs maybe 2 times. even if there isn t that much research  it s something she really recognizes in her life. especially if she travels.so imo it shows  how a lot of this activists are hypocrits. because who should know better about this topic  she is trans. she is sad because of all the people who transition without being trans. that will be a huge problem in a couple of years. and they hate her so much. if it s about prisons and bathrooms  toilets  she says  if they are fully transitioned  it s ok  but not with their male bodyparts. we see what happens. or in sports  ok  trans people usually can t compete with men  but they could get a own category. or they just don t do it. for some things you have to bring sacrificis. if you have a car crash  it can end your career in sports. if you get ill and it goes really bad. there are even som other surgeries that could cause that. cancer could. if you have to remove an organ. problems with the lung. smoking. even surgery for beauty  if it s extreme enough  can have an impact on some things in sports.and all the promoting and celebrating that is bad. she says  it s nothing to celebrate. she really had to suffer before her transition. the hate. what she wanted to do  and how she had to fight to not do it. she says  if something is offensive  it s celebrating it  because it was painful and terrible. and real trans people know that. a lot of the woke stuff is harmful. she says  maybe you could compare it to surviving cancer. if you have cancer  and tey have to remove parts of your body. how would it feel to see people celebrating activly that. not like  celebrating  that someone survived. more like  celebrating what they had to remove. that for example a part of the stomach or gut is gone.and here  this game  it targets insecure children. they spread a lot of lies. because atm they tell people  if they aren t sure about certain things like a hobby  a color  music  horses  dresses  anything like that  they could be trans. but that s wrong. being trans seems to be something very extreme. it s nothing with  maybe . she said  she knew it with around 3 or 4 years. and growing up there were more and more problems  and for her everything that made her male was extremly disgusting. that it was not something like wearing dresses  liking pink  having long hair  it was her body. and just very extreme. and still  it was good  that she really had to go to the doctor  to speak woth him  to try psycho therapy and so on. it was around 1 year until she was allowed to transition. and that s how it should be. and she says it  as trans woman.but they basically tell young  insecure children  they would be trans  because of certain interests they have. not because feeling the need to remove parts of their body  hating certain things  being extremly disgusted. and a lot of them believe it. and they regret it. and this game will just make all of that worse. because  yes  there isn t really the target audience that could play that characters. it s not like someone asked for it. but if it s out  it will paint a totally wrong picture about  how it is to be trans. it will be about dresses  about colors  about horses. about hair and make up. and about  if children like that  maybe they are trans. and it will be about celebrating it. like  look how great it is to be trans. and it s not just a movie. it s some type of simulation. and if you play sims  you play it a lot. so i totally don t like it  because that could lead to a lot of people thinking  they are trans  while just being insecure or having some unusual interests. for me  it s not just like  nobody wanted it. or not like  it s not appropriate. but  it will lead to people making wrong decisions  and they will regret it later  but there is no way back...greetings from germany!
the sims was always fruity  it was a matter of time until they go down this road
they are like a swiss army knife aren t they
at this point  there s too much expansion to the sims 4. no way it could load right.
they should at least let you create dr frank n furter if they do this
ah yes  the  middle finger to the players  update.
i started playing sims 4 a bit recently because i grew up with sims. i get bored after about ten minutes but its fun... however. look up the sims play with life trailer... this shit s been on the horizon for a long time
part of me wonders if the more mainstream this gets  the less appealing it will be to the trenders
after thinking a bit  if they are going to simulate that. they need to include in base game with scheduled infections every month  cost of surgery  medication  and additional issues. but i doubt it.
those hearing aids may make me buy the game. in what colors do they come
i honestly feel ea just did this to get people back into the game. i don t think this update is a good idea in the long run because it s gonna bring out the worst in some people.   when you have a game played by all ages a update like this isn t right imo  you are gonna confuse some kids teenagers who won t understand what is happening. adults have the option to make the choice who they want to be but teenagers kids shouldn t have that shoved onto them
it feels like they re just playing the trend. by adding these non-gameplay-changing items they appease some ppl which in turn results in more game dlc sales and overall support. but ofc that will also turn some ppl off from the game. but ultimately the woke points they gain from this still remain so perhaps thats the goal  idk.
can t wait to see them going broke!!! groomers
everyone is equal in the eyes of my ladderless swimming pools.
awesome hoodie  btwi really wanna get one
i think they should replace the sim speech with biden just talking normally.
i can t believe you just casually glossed over the light switch
best way of protest  make a straight  single gender character  take a snapshot  send it to the company and brag how you refused to use the transgender option.
so can the game get updated to m and have  disturbing images  added i was always freaked out by the grimm reaper in the game but now it may be creeper.
well i m officially done with the sims then.
sims haven t been good in years  i love 1 and 2
love your videos
new assets are purely visual and don t add new gameplay functionality ..so just like in real life . great sim game. lol
i can donate to ur channel now ok that s awesome i got u
added to the blacklist.maxiselectronic arts
im suprised they didnt make it a dlc. sims is a massive cashgrab
i wonder how successful this new content would have been if they sold it as a dlc like they usually do with new sims content.
imagine thinking the sim you made doesn t identify as the gender you gave them.
were finally getting the woke dlc for the sims  damn took ea looong enough lmfao !!!
the family friendly drag pack.
will or can you force them into other people spaces  can the other sims feel uncomfortable
i wonder if there s any way to remove cas items in sims4studio. any modders out there know how on another note  simmers have recently been getting a lot of... bugs where parents and adults can have a romantic relationship bar with their children....if that is a bug.
i actually have no issues with things like hearing aids  etc  even a wheelchair if they wanted to go that far  as these are required to address real physical disabilities and including them in the sims i could see as being a good way to help younger people -- let s face it  kids do play the sims  regardless of the age limits on it -- understand such things  as for the transgender content  nope... just... nope...
who are they trying to impress that are not fans nor gamers themselves
i haven t played sims in a long time. but this new stuff  i m not into. i ll just play old sims if i ever want to play it again. but this all sounds distgusting. thank you for informing us on all of this. good to see ya. take melonie. oh and i m enjoying rewatching the live streams.
aww i wanted to hear about the light switch and you skipped right over it
sims - now that is a game i haven t heard in a long time.a long time.
why not go full gigachad
@merafirewing6591  that seems like overkill.........sounds perfect!
then you receive an email from ea that your account has been banned for violating the tos because of hate speech or something like that.
well at least you can t be accused of deleting your own account out of protest in which they dub you hateful  they just did the job for you all because you freely spoke against it. and honestly  that seems more like them shooting themselves in the foot. imagine if a majority of those customers felt the same way  is ea really so ego minded that they would rather do away with all those customers to save their pride  if so  well i ll give em their integrity  but go woke still goes broke.
@crimzonnova5368  ea long stopped caring about quality games and theri customers as soon as they became consumed with having a good esg score.
how is that protest  they re making an option for people who aren t exactly like you. they couldn t care less they want to add more ways for more people to play.
this will do nothing they probably won t even see the image. they make millions every month. they couldn t care less about what y all have to say.
yeah because the company will totally be so afraid of that.people send emails of love and suggestions for their games and it usually get flitered out or just kind put in a spam folder i bet a media worker would take one look at your email and it go right into the trash icon dude lol.amazing idea lol.
@toastedplants518  this is the same as a dude saying i won t watch the next disney movie.its ineffectual and does nothing lol.
god bless you.if this is too creepy for you  then i m sorry for you  this is just sad.
@funpolishfox5410  exactly what i was thinking like there is a part of me that can understand our rating update to em and maybe dimension of adult themes but that s it
you may want to reword that replace the implication that you re talkin about trans fifa with anything else and then repeat that to yourself i think you ll see what i mean
you can literally do that  lmao  do you even play the game
@funpolishfox5410  he means as in disapproving of their life choices.not just being mean.
@funpolishfox5410  no i don t
sims 3! however it takes a while through the loading screen though lol another thing  there s freaking cheats and mods  no fucking need to do a freaking update for those weirdos.
i really hope you will never go to hospital  if this sounds dusgusting for you.this is nothing and is pretty normal.
@funpolishfox5410  i used to work at a hospital.
i also worked in clinic and was seeing operations.again  pretty normal stuff imo.
@lorddenalian1416  sims 3 plays so much more smoothly and the open world is much better...once you get it loaded up  and the mod community is still really active.
when i opened the game and saw the binder  i literally just thought it was a new tank top.my version doesn t even have the pronouns feature since i play it in japanese. i m not japanese i m just learning japanese.
remember when the main reason people played the sims was to drown them in swimming pools by removing the ladders
the  achievements  of our friends from open society foundation
my eyes have rolled right out the back of my head
tts throne emperor   this is surreal. am i on drugs
i ve been noticing updates injecting these things into some games  i m not surprised this happened unfortunately. you re pretty knowledgeable in how these trans-mutilations affect the body  would love to see you go in depth on that and hopefully people will understand how unhealthy this is. here s another little something to hopefully make your day like you do mine. have a wonderful day!
i see more hogwarts legacy videos in the future
i m genuinely shocked this hasn t been taken down for that common sense take on the trans bathroom issue.
yes! i get to save even more money lol
we have to buy a full priced expansion pack to get weather and changing seasons in the sims 4 but transing the children is a base game update we can t avoid if we also want those bug fixes.  fml
i miss the sims bustin out and sims 2 both on xbox.
the world has gone nuts and continues to be in the 2020s
my golden dream  escape from the sad reality by playing a second life game... and still be diabetic
great video!if they want to include things like this  fine.  but make it a dlc instead of integrating it to the base game.  that way parents and players who don t have any interest in this can play  or let their kids play  without seeing it.  make the dlc free even  if you want to avoid being accused of monetizing the culture  nevermind that putting it in the game is monetizing the culture   but keep it out of the basic no-frills game.i loved playing original sims just to see what kind of fun houses i could build  even if they looked more like a barracks in the beginning as i needed to have eight people living there to make money fast enough to keep up with my building ideas.  i miss playing that game  but haven t felt the urge to play anything after the original.  this just increases that disinterest.
i can finally make the mentally ill character of my dreams
is this mandatory  i ve never gotten a single expansion for it haha
my own daughter plays sims 4  and i ll have to explain that stupid update. might have gone under the radar if you hadn t mentioned it. thank you
the sims is a fun game as i can be on that for hours and hours day by day easily when i start a new game. then fall off of it after like two weeks  don t play for a year  and the start it all over again lol. but this is just disturbing. i mean like within the game you can already have same sex couples and whatever  but did they really need to add this  i get the sims is suppose to be a life simulation game  but let s keep it how it was and not bring in more issues.
go boom girl
i just heard  that there s a mod  that allows an adult to bed teens.by the way  i ve never heard of someone  who wants to play as a diabetic or a deaf person. this is wheelchair accessible dungeons in d d all over again.
theres channels of detransers who have brought up how they regret it deeply cause they cant take certain changes back. for example there has been men saying they miss their you know. i think those channels need more recognition because they tell people the reality of how permanent a change it can become the longer youre on horomones and do surgery.
@buddingqueen  i couldn t agree more  they re sad stories and i unfortunately have a male friend attempting this as well. i m praying for him to turn around and realize the problem before it s too late. of course the woke controlled media will fight tooth and nail to suppress those channels since it doesn t fit their narrative.
@batman0  theres one i follow whos had people try to take her channel many of times. she even shared her story. she said at one point  i hate how deep my voice is. its ugly.  and i felt so bad fo her. i can actually relate since naturally i got a deep but not too manly voice. its not great for singing and i love to do so
thank you so much for the super thanks! and yeah i will have to do that in a video soon!  d
@meloniemacgoboom  glad to see bigger channels like yours and other s talking about important topics like this. im showing my neighbor this vdeo later. her daughter loves the sims games.
@meloniemacgoboom  you re so welcome! looking forward to that!
@meloniemacgoboom  this is exactly why the world is in a bad place. this with the sims is only one of them  we ve been manipulated since the beginning of time  which is why today almost all of us say life is hard. but for the rich and the big one s life is a rollercoaster. life should be a rollercoaster for all of us  but we ve been robbed from enjoying the world god gave us. start from school  heck even start from when you are a new born and take the first injection from hospital. then and there you are under their thumb. i wish you could understand what i mean.we are a muppet show doing what they want us to do.
@funpolishfox5410  it is mutilation. so is circumcision. basically a group of people with mental health issues are going to surgeons when the should be going to psychologists.
@buddingqueen  yeah but those aren t even in the majority of trans people. they re cautionary tales but that doesn t mean being trans immediately means you ll regret it
@mrgerr454  the self deletion rate says otherwise. treating a sickness of the mind with affirmation and eventually surgery  mutilation  isn t a positive thing. imagine telling schizophrenia patients that the voices in their heads are real and then forcing other people to validate their feelings.
is this a reminder to preorder hogwarts legacy
i agree  i don t want sims or characters who have sickle cell like me.i blame their target audience  the casual consumers who play dumb and feed into the nonsense.because realistically and statistically the highest percentage of people in america and the world are not with the clown world nonsense and refused to have it shoved down our throats.i was calling for a video game crash back in 2012 but it will happen soon if they keep this up.
5 o clock shadow on the middle one
didn t they already have the option to make your sim  ambigious   that not good enough anymore
i guess the company got the request for those features  right   let s see how sales and user base numbers increase with the changes
a game that has millions of children playing  human tamagotchi   and actually has in game children .. doing this  is very creepy
that playstation hoodie is badass
validating others in their mental illness is a selfish act.  absolutely correct. it s stunning and unfortunate most people do not realize this.
can we talk about that i cant add scars later in the game  why can i change body shape but not that     btw according to this update i don t think the developers wanted to hurt anyone. i understand your points but if that makes anyone happy  why not
i m a type 1 diabetic. i play video games so i can relax and not be in the real world for a couple of hous. why the eff would i want a gluecose meter or insuline pump in my video game  i want to be taken out of the real world to relax  not thrown back in.     melonie i love you and your content. thank you for doing this video for us. i hope you have a blessed day.
im loving your videos keep them coming
eventually  all these changes to sims will come back to bite them on their asses.  these companies are looking to tap into what they believe has untapped potential.  has the whole world seems to go completely nuts
the transgender thing was added a couple of years ago  i think. but  the surgery scars  jaysus.
completly unrelated. what s your hair routine  my hair is similar to yours  but i always just straighten it because that s the only way i can  make it look presentable  but your waves are so perfect  i m curious  3
neovag updates now! i wana swamp bussy on my sims or bigotry !
luckily mods took that back out of my game
your amazing  keep up the great work.
yeah this is really disappointing for me.  my sister really likes this game  she s in her 20s and not a teen but it s still ticks me off that something she enjoys has to be messed with like this.  i even had fun with her creating stuff in the game  but i really don t want to support this game anymore.  i can t control what she does but i think i need to make a more active stance in not supporting this!!!
that hoodie is sick where did you get it
as a sim player and a father. the last thing i would want is to add my sim disability in my make pretend game.
correct
no   stunning and brave!  ima gonna puke my guts out
you do realize the mental illness is usually mitigated by giving them affirming care. not denying them their identity because you disagree
@mrgerr454  based
@emilyalucard1055  i know right. respecting other people s humanity is based lol
@mrgerr454  based and chaos pilled
@mrgerr454  you apparently don t realize that suicide rates among transgenders remains high even if they receive  affirming care   and that there are also numerous de-transitioners who have testified that the  affirming care  did not help their situation and often made it worse. there is also considerable evidence that the rate of de-transitioners is severely underreported.
@jackbrealey1999  people somehow don t understand that concept and it s frightening. they re crying over a video game making options for people who actually exist because they feel it s yucky.
@jackbrealey1999  based
@jackbrealey1999   no  the fix is to align the mind and body by helping the person to accept what their body really is. we don t cut off the arms of people whose mental illness makes them say they should be amputees  we don t paralyze the people whose mental illness says they should be wheelchair bound. neither should we be mutilating the bodies of those whose mental illness says they are the opposite gender.where do you think i got these ideas  from the very psychologists  who have been studying these things for years !
@mrgerr454  no we don t. i work with young adults suffering with severe autism and mental health. we do not allow them to eat poo  we do not allow them to eat pieces of metal  we do not allow them to touch or attack other service users  we do not allow them to mutilate themselves  we do not allow them to run into traffic. this is strikingly  normal  behaviour in my line of work  i see it all the time  but we do not affirm it. if we did  they d either kill themselves  or kill someone else.
this is why i  as a grown man  have started accompanying my woman or female children under my supervision into restrooms. the sad thing is  no female has ever complained about it. i have received the occasional compliment for looking after them  but never once a complaint. i just stand outside the stall and mind my own business and no one says anything because they know exactly why i have to be in there. how shameful it is that we live in a society where females appreciate men being in their safe space because they don t feel safe in them anymore without us.
@unofficialname  i am pretty sure as an autistic person affirming us is not encouraging us to do severe things.i was always encouraged to not see myself as much different than others but its so nice nowadays with all the insane anti vaxxers who want to tell me i am some kind of monstrosity and that its so horrible their kids may have even minor autism.of course i get the more severe ones are bad but its still like they have to be affirmed their condition does not make them less validated i thought.
@peaceandloveusa6656  i feel like this is almost impossible or is in some specific place.if it happened here i doubt it go over well.
@unofficialname  who is we  are you a psychologist who expressly works with people struggling with their gender identity  the fact you compare a grown adult functioning in society who is looking for treatment and care to help them feel more comfortable in their own body to someone trying to eat shit or metal is frankly disgusting. its not self mutilation unless you also agree that any other medical service that requires a surgeon is also self mutilation. you can t be wishy washy on that thing cause if you are then nothing you say even matters. people who are seeking help for their gender identity with a trained professional should be left alone and not infantilized and told they don t know what they re talking about.
that s what i was thinking. i don t have the same issues  but a game is to escape the real world.
this reminds me of people who hated survival viewer in mgs3 because it was somewhat realistic and slowed down the pace.i loved it and i hated how they never brought it back.realism can sometimes be fun especially in a simulator of sorts. hell project zomboid is basically like sims but more gritty and with zombies and allows you to add certain limitations like deafness  body fat  bad knees and such.
people just want sims that look like them. sure some players want a utopia but some dont
what the h - e double hockey sticks is going on!   we as humans surely forget the joys of video games
the moment the update goes live  there will be mods to remove this degeneracy. hell  if they don t come out fast enough  i ll make one myself.i have a love hate relationship with the sims but the game can still be modded to add or remove things very smoothly.
i really don t think kids and teenagers  should be taking hormone blockers or undergoing surgeries.  i think that s a reasonable assertion  and it s a damn shame people who say things along those lines are made out to be bigots or transphobic or whatever.side note  that s an awesome hoodie mel.  please play yakuza 0 if you haven t yet!
my cuzin who loves playing the sims always joked she fears the psychological state of a sims gamer more than a cod gamer
if these people seriously want tolerance  they re going about it in all the wrong ways.forcing your personal beliefs onto your consumers is an arrogant  narcissistic move that reeks of  you ll do this  you ll like this  or else.  and it garners hatred that otherwise wouldn t exist if these people would have just left this issue alone and allowed their customer base to make their own decisions for their characters. i know for a fact these people would get their panties in a wad if the sims added a religion update that forced your sims to all worship christianity or something.
i really thought sims already had this
it s amusing how people are so triggered by this. don t get mad about the developers game giving options to use for those who want to use them.   vote with your money if you truly can t stand this and stop playing the game buying new packs. the community won t miss you.
i know i m supposed to like boycott.. what sucks is i actually kind of like building in the game. i wish sims had a good competitor but really they re the only game in that genre with freedom to do whatever.
of course they do this instead of fixing all the bugs that make the game damn near unplayable.
me  can i have cars back in the simsea  here trans scars
this isn t ideal but a much bigger issue that both sims and fort nite has is targeting kids with dlc hooking them with the colors acting like a kind of crack but for minors.
i remember playing the sims on my dads old nokia phone
imagine having such an external locus of identity that you need a sim to wear a hearing aid or colostomy bag just so you feel like your existence is validated
i look at what is considered entertainment nowadays  and i realize there s no such thing anymore  everything has been tainted by politics  activism and social nonsense garbage  whether it s movies  videogames or sports. i truly pity the young people who missed the days when normalcy existed.
didn t they have x rated mods for this game that already did this
i don t understand why all of this is just now happening all of a sudden... this is awful...
it s not happening so much that it had to be added as a gameplay feature for children in a video game that is literally a life simulator. makes perfect sense  right
i m surprised ea is charging money for this
i stopped playing the sims 4 because of the wokeness a while ago. i ll just stick with the sims 3.
at least in cod i can be a bigot if i really want to through voice chatin the sims 4 i can t. i can be mean sure  but i can t have a sim tell another sim who s trans that they don t agree with their lifestylenever understood how it s considered a life simulator
it s the same mindset of  my naked lady tattoo represents   my very soul    how dare you ask me to cover it up at work.
also  the sims 4 is just an awful sims game. the sims have no character or personality. every sim is the same. the traits mean nothing . the game sucks and they are trying to fix it with wokeness points instead of making a good game.
@user-tr3oz6me2w  thank you! also  literally any sim can adopt a trait so easily that it doesn t feel unique at all.the high school expansion was also extremely disappointing. oh and i love that the  teens  have the exact body shape as adults...
i m willing to bet money that the sims  which is known for nickle and diming their players for every little feature  pushed this update into the game for free  with no options to opt out.change my mind.
kids  especially young kids  are naturally based. i think the only effect that subjecting them to this accurate  albeit incomplete  representation of the typically grotesque looking reality of transness will just have a deterring outcome. nobody looks at those in-game models and thinks  this is how i want to look .
19 50 yep  love the sinner  hate the sin.
we had this in switzerland in the 70s and 80s when the hippies came to power in the school system. they said children are sexual beings  children need to explore their sexuality you can imagine what came next. we are back on the same path
id really enjoy playing the sims specially the sims 2 on gamecube n 4 on ps4 pro ive think this is an absurd n ridiculous btw your hood is very beautiful n cool melonie
the sims 3 even with the bugs and crashes is a hundred times better than the trash 4
meh i ll chalk it up to them wanting everyone to be able to make themselves in the game. i really don t have a problem with this honestly.
the sims 4 introduced pronouns years ago and the men in the sims 4 just look waaaayyy to feminine. i ll just stick to the sims 2 and hope for a sims 1 remaster at some point  probably never but is so hard to get it to work . also on the facebook post for this  i went to the comments section  and it was just people complaining about more bugs
but you could already make freaky looking sims.
i don t see that much of a problem with this update  there are several other games that has transgender characters  but it should be put on games on like 16 up years or something  however  my real problem is that they should focus on more important  inclusion  things than transgender.
where can we buy this hoodie
hi melonie i m digging your hoodie outfit. takecare melonie
if ea is going to do that then make a separate version of the game  and let the parents to decide to buy it or not it shouldn t be forced
i thought you can already do that. it s been a long time but you can put a male character in a dress or maybe i m remember the wrong game.
there is no excuse for this the developers are groomers and should be in prison!
good god  am i glad i never got into that game series!
i mean technically it was always there. guys could wear women clothing and vice versa  you can also set you sims settings to basically be trans cuz u can make it so men can get preggers.
they add what  what!
another problem is you said because this game is rated t for teen that means you gotta be 13 and up to play it--- we can only wish that was the case.we all know too damn well that too many parents let their kids play games well above their age restrictions. as far as many parents are concerned  m for mature means e for everyone.
feeling a strong need to defend myself  being a  cute little girl avatar  . some of us are just weebs   that is all.
history repeats its self. especially in a world like now where no one learns
do you know dexter s laboratory cartoon  it is a comedy cartoon but there is an episode where a hippies couple had a baby boy and they turned him into a girl
@missmeme3946  yes i know dexter  but have only seen a few episodes. what was the tone of this episode  was it portrayed rather positively or negatively
@buddingqueen  sad but true
@missmeme3946  wasn t that mandark origin story  he s dexter s rival villain.
@hanako-kun3047  yes
@wodan85   i don t think it was positive episode because they made it as the boy hate it and his parents forced him he even chose a boy name and told people his boy name while the parents keep calling him with his girl namethe episode name a boy named sueit came in 2002
@missmeme3946  interesting  that happens  sadly in the real world too. today  the story would probably not be told in the same way. if i find the episode somewhere i will watch it
@missmeme3946  poor guy was named susan.
yeah you have  its been in the game for 6 or 7 years at this point.
right of course  just saying that the liability is still heavy on the game itself because this content for 13 year olds is even terrible
if it was a paid dlc then whatever. but this is included in an update. meaning it is forced on you. you can t choose not to instal it. you accept it or you can t play the game you paid for.
this is unfortunate being someone who grow up on the roller coaster  tycoon zoo  tycoon and the sims on ps2. why did they have to go woke  everything is being ruined i figured that the sims would get the woke treatment but this is to much now. life in the early 2000 s looks even more missed as we go on in time.
actually people do  and have asked for many medical devices... including hearing aides.
definitely important for kids to be able to choose what sex organs and sex identifiers people have in their games
senzu beans heal physical damage  only therapy will aid emotional trauma you can t fix psychological issues with physical solutions  it only causes new physical issues that are masking still existing psychological issues...
here s the thing i don t understand. the entire point of transitioning  from everything i ve heard  is that people don t feel they are in their correct body. setting aside whether that s right  wrong  or whatever  that s the point - to  fix  something that is wrong  correct  the thing is  a character in a game  including the sims afaik  are built how the player wants from the start. as in  there shouldn t be anything that needs to be  fixed   because all of the options were chosen by the player to begin with. it s not like i picked someone else s character  and they have to go in and adjust it to meet their mental image of the character after the fact. they picked things themselves. so why does there need to be anything like this in a game to begin with
great. let me know when my sim can read the bible and go to church  where s my catering
ea really went full woke. i noticed this recently with nfs unbound with rainbow flags preceding national flags for the car decals  then they uglified characters in the dead space remake and call out a lesbian relationship within 5 minutes of the game  now trans in sims 4
i pity any woman who would want to use the same bathroom as me.
i m confused  wouldn t someone who is trans just make their character the gender they want to be
not that surprising since a big chunk of the sims community are people who supports this stuff.it s pretty sad that the sims also has been popular with kids for a long time. worse - the sims is the kind of game that does shape their perception of what the real world was like much more than other genres because it s a life simulator.
so  sims 4 should receive an m rating for being visually disturbing on the order of silent hill 2
they ve watered down those labels so much that they don t really mean anything anymore. except to them.
most people i know stop playing sims 4 already. i myself stopped when they throw in packs with little content. i still play sims 2 and 3 from time to time but sims 4 turn me off due to the expansions having very little content.
i am finding that these game companies need to go out of business. they have been corrupted with the influence of those that do not even play the games  but just want to insert evil stuff into them  to fit their narrative. i think these people should just be mocked to the point they change their ways  hopefully.
when has the sims still been relevant  hopefully not much longer after this bs.
to be honest  i don t care about most of it anymore  anyone wants to include something in anything  go for it because it ultimately is an decision by the creators devs publishers to do whatever they want with their products  the end choice is pretty much either you choose to buy it  or you choose not to. there is still plenty of other stuffs that stays traditional  i loved saints row 3 and 4 but i choose not to buy the new saints row because i don t care for it .nothing can really do much as it s shown that most will go ahead and do it anyways despite the loud voices of against.
2 45 so you re able to wear one of those paper masks that doesn t work in real life in the game as well  sweet  who wouldn t want by game like this...
i mean  it s just a game  you have to be stupid  to be mad about it.
@funpolishfox5410  nobody is mad. we just don t want kids being confused. that s not right.
@hotcheetogirl_  bro  kids are confused about maths  but nobody is banning it. kid can starts to think about it  but it would do it  even without the game.trying to understand yourself is something everyone has gone through. if kid is not transgender  this game won t change anything  chill.
@funpolishfox5410  math is essential  that s like saying  kids are confused about food  should we ban food . basic math skills helps with the natural flow of the world. binders  puberty blockers and all of that is not essential to survival in a society. try again.
@hotcheetogirl_  okey.is make-up essential for society  no.is plastic surgeries essential for society  also no.is even this video essential for society  not even close.but  those things exist because they re simply make life easier or just make person feel better. and mental health is important  because if we all went crazy  there would be no society.also  fun fact- puberty blockers and hormones are literally used outside of transgender issues  they re part of medical treatment  so they are essential to society.
@hotcheetogirl_  also  there being only male and female is incorrect. there are intersex people born and also  genes making gender can get mixed up  there is a reason for the turner syndrome to exists. for this syndrome  surprise surprise  you need hormones.
@skelliosiss  and you are calling me furry  really mature.maybe the maths example wasn t the best  but is clearly better that all the people thinking that a game will confuse kids kmao.
@funpolishfox5410  it s not even just the game that s confusing kids. it s everything combined. you ve got to be a dimwit to think that small things don t influence human beings.
@funpolishfox5410  it s children being exposed to things they can t reasonably understand  probably without the consent of parents for greed and manipulation. it s not anger it s disgust
@grimmacemack  true  ea is greedy as shit  i ll give you that.and children are exposed to a lot of things they don t understand. but explaining things in a way they can understand is a thing  buddy. and explaining being transgender is not disgusting  being transgender is not disgusting.we shouldn t let children be exposed to violence or sex. but being transgender is neither of this. this is just normal part of life.
@zega_x  yeah  children shouldn t play gta  but this is favourite childhood game for many. people being transgender is normal and won t hurt kids. if you don t understand it  then you were never around kids.
@mrmistah1588  tell me you don t understand what is child grooming without telling me you don t understand child grooming.grooming a child is gaining their trust and making bad things normal for them.explaining showing what transgender means  is not grooming.
@funpolishfox5410  nothing you tell me is going to change my opinion budstop replying to every single comment with your nonsense and get a job
@hotcheetogirl_  kids are always confused hell i am not a kid and i am confused.not about gender but certainly sex has something to do with it tor me and self loathing lol.
@hotcheetogirl_  except schools often teach like higher level math i had to learn geomentry and trigomentry which my own teacher said we won t use in most of our life.consumer math is basic math skills and guess what  i barely learned that lol.
@chandllerburse737  if you have basic math skills you can function. teaching higher level math comes when you make it to a higher level. nobody is teaching a twelve year old trigonometry unless they are super smart and can understand it. if not  you ll go onto the next stage of the math that is similar to the last but a bit more challenging. idk what school you went to that didn t transition you from one type of math to the next but it s not a good school.
@hotcheetogirl_  i just sucked at math division fucking sucked and multipication sucked and i never really progressed past that much.i hated it then i hate it now.and high school ended up being nothing but higher level math.reminds me of how i was taught cursive once in 1st grade and i forgot it.
@chandllerburse737  ummm....ok...
@chandllerburse737  can you count past 20  that s all i need to know
@hotcheetogirl_  why do you even care  and yes  but counting isnt the damn issue its being able to do consumer math at a fast space when needed.oh who cares anyways the news is already on about war again so either my minor math skills will be literally non existent soon or i ll be counting sticks.
@chandllerburse737   wtf are you even on my guy
@hotcheetogirl_  whats with you insulting me randomly because i answered the question yeah maybe the war stuff was meaningless but can t a guy vent a little  thats all anyone does on these videos anyways hell thats mostly what melonie does.
@chandllerburse737  sure
@hotcheetogirl_  shore
that s the exact reason why people hate this
@drawingmagicboy  oh i totally understand  it goes to a whole new level.
.__.edit  i ve got some trans friends  and yeaaaahh... they would wanna play the gender they want to be instead of that. i feel like that might be for  uh  the very  passionate fans  if you catch my drift  i knew several  they asked me in the past to transition to male so they could get me a boyfriend to  ship  us . also i get that someone put work into those scars  but i ve seen modders make much better looking scars for characters  all sorts of scars  not just those .
they need to change the name to  the simps .
good thing my pirated copy will never connect to the internet to update.
gotta b honest... didn t even know people still played this game  2003 flashbacks fr
what is weird is to see how fetishized the scar from a top surgery is among transmen. they are literally fawning over the product of bad surgery and or bad aftercare.
loving the playstation hoodie
i played the sims 4 for years before giving it up after two years since the updates and most recent packs became disappointment dumpster fires. i m confused after hearing this  why do they have this brought up  why now  transgender options were previously included in the game years ago. there are mods  hearing aids  surgery scars  and binders  that have achieved more in cc. and yes  the sims community has repeatedly desired wheelchairs and hearing aids for a long time. but the sims community itself is not only weird but toxic as well.
i remember we had a class that we played the sims in
sims is not for kids anymore like velma welcome to 2023
my dearest aunt died of breast cancer because  in part  she refused to get rid of her breasts as part of the treatment. for her  that would have meant to get rid of one of the qualities that made her a woman. now people and even doctors are recommending mastectomies to girls who have barely even developed them... wtf is wrong with this timeline.
so instead of making sure the dlc works and fixing stability issues  this is the most pressing  i mean who asked for this
the sims free play has done something like this as well
i knew sims is known for being absurd but this is pushing a bit innit
but the light switch!! the light swith!!  whyyy   just kidding i totally agree with you melonie this woketon is getting ridiculous
top surgery scar  being a feature really takes the cake. its like a badge of honor for them.
some people are really trying to open up accessibility with their games. but the problem is when you focus more on the features instead of improving the gameplay as a whole. anything can have features  but you need to keep the core experience going.btw  really surprised you didn t do something on what s happening with tomb raider between its new mobile game  its powerwash dlc and amazon s  600 million purchase of the rights.
this isn t surprising really  considering the sims seems to be very popular among the gay trans community. most of the youtubers i have seen doing content are gay or at least terminally woke.if this wasn t part of an agenda  and something people actually wanted  it would have been paid dlc  and then you could measure how few people actually want this crap. we re talking about ea here. they have never seen a micro-transaction they didn t like.. so yeah  the fact they are doing this  for free  means you can t even opt out of it.
if there was a greater need for a genocide simulator i can t think of it.
i am so glad i stopped playing sims4... as someone that went to bat for it over the craptastic and bug filled open world sims 3... i am embarassed as to what it has become...whats worse is these things and the pronoun updates arent even part of an expansion you can just avoid  they are mandatory updates that happen as you log into the game.
i guess i get one more group of people to lock up in the pool
yeah honestly most of the time when companies do stuff like this it s people who have never actually met a trans person in their life ifrogz ample would much rather just play as a sexy big titty vampire woman then the sexy big titty goth trans woman that i am the fact is video games allow us to do and be things that we never could or in some cases improve aspects of our existing cells for some men they ll make their character an adonis and some women will make themselves human barbies and most trans people i m going to go out on a limb and say 99.999  will simply just to make a character in game that matches them mentally and emotionally because well you know it s a video game and even if my transition person wasn t perfect in real life or there s issues with my body and presentation i can erase those in a video game the same as everyone else who has ever made a custom character in a video game that is meant to reflect themselves in some way shape or form
i m sticking with my theory that a lot of people had serious mental breakdowns during the covid lockdown and never recovered from it
the absurd of this situation is the fact that this is free lmao
they even could have made it part of a free dlc pack  they have a few of those  but putting it in the base game  forces everyone to be exposed to it.
i don t know what all the fuss is about you wearing a playstation sweatshirt but i think you look really good in it! i also love your setup! props to you  melanie!
this is going to implode someday. this isn t to bad but should ve been an optional update for whoever wants it
i sense a furry update is on its way to sims now haha.
they need to change the rated from t for teens to xxx for adults only.
actually  i see this as a major win for anyone interested in installing a murder mod and role-playing as jeffrey dahmer or john wayne gacy.
can we go back to having vampires sleep with werewolves and hope to get a cross breed  he ll i ll settle for making an alien witch...
reads title  no.... what  they wouldn t    watches video  oh....oh.....oh my
satan s having a field day on this planet  man.
the fact this game is marketed to teens is disgusting. everyday we stray further from god.
maybe the light switch goes from ac to dc
oh no! the end of the world is near! the sims will offer players more options to express themselves!
i personally don t care that there are trans options for adults  i mean  i don t think i can in good faith condemn digital adults transitioning while still being okay with digital adults being allowed to murder in games such as gta . that said  i agree with you that giving kids surgical options related to transgenderism is too far. the problem is that the people who support this often have an  all-or-nothing  mentality. they think that either you want kids to get top surgery at 11  or you want all trans people to die  and there is absolutely no in-between. and that mentality doesn t work because many  like myself  are in between those two positions. i don t think minors should be allowed to surgically transition  but if they decide to transition as adults  i can respect their decision  and i do not think anyone should commit violence against them.
you re late to the boat on this one. sims have been adding lg-alphabet creepy content into their game for a long time.
i love the logic of these people. 11 years old can consent to change gender  but they can t drink or vote or even dictate which parent they want to live with
im surprised they didn t make it a new expansion pack they would have made bank from them and i wouldn t have bought it.
i wouldn t say ea or maxis or whatever is necessarily  grooming kids   it just seems like they are trying too hard to be inclusive to the lgbt community. they know a large part of their player base is lgbt people and this is them trying to market to them in the worst way possible.i have no problems with trans people  but i don t think it s appropriate to have this as a feature in the game.
this should be an adults only rated game.
with all the things going on  why are people actually pressed about this  it s not harmful nor is it pushing any messaging to have items that are trans affirming in a game. it s weird that people are actually mad about them adding these items for no reason.
ha-ah oh boy another company that doesn t understand the get woke  go broke message  picks up pitchfork and torches  alright everybody you know the drill by now  get them!!!   fyi  my comment is just a joke don t take it to serious
they just need to play the  silent  rpgs on  gender  and  create a char they like.  old style   yes.  cloud was trans to one who found his her life in the life stream of oppo gender ... the regular male player found him to be their younger self brought into maturity and waxing on the hotties.... no one is right and no one is wrong.  when identities in games are made specific... that is when the war and fallout occurs.  i made a game plotline character creator about this decades ago and released it on android much to the dismay and sometimes cheers of everyone... and i wasn t even trying to prove a point... just giving everyone healthcare options for their hangovers.... i still have the sourcecode and config ai dialog trees.  it was a pretty natural char creator and adventure suited to anyone to play -- without being identitarian or whatever.
being transgender is something normal  they should add this ealier.
they already have that in the werewolves pack
@drakkiss  oh geeze
id rather furries be in it than trans...
@manco65  it s part of a halloween type thing. not furry. so vampires  witches  werewolves  etc.
imagine thinking being furry is the same as being transgender  you gotta be joking.
@drakkiss  lmao too funny
@funpolishfox5410  furries are kind of cringe at least the really obsessive ones.also not to mention one of the worst people thats ever existed is kero the wolf.
that s not a video game rating it would just be rated a that s as high as video game ratings go that would prevent it from being sold on most stores shelves in america or on any console so the best you could hope for would be a mature you got to remember what company makes the sims the second-worst in the industry ea all that being said frankly if it weren t for the fact that there are trans options for the team sims this would literally be a complete non-issue
lmfao
sad truth
speaking of god  this is the same company that refused to add anything related to christianity because they  don t want religious concepts in the game  and then released an update with an islamic theme.
it s being pushed by the same people jesus kicked out of the temple
yes every day. i hate it
its about as disgusting as conker bad fur day being put on the same shelf as mario 64 and ignorant parents buying it for kids.
ps  i doubt if a char creator with real rpg in this  day and age  could be balanced like that.
and when i say  suited to anyone to play .... i mean 18-years and over in age.  i rated it  not for kids  when i released it.
if that sentiment  violent video games makes kids violent  myth can be debunked  then i highly doubt that having a trans option in a game would make kids trans. if they do come out as trans after playing the game  chances are they felt that way before playing the game.
another reason to justify my decision to not play the sims anymore.
i asked for an ingrown toenail in my son s toe. maybe one on the finger too   i m not sure.
based on the following verse  and others   i am pretty sure no one needs help loving themselves... in the last days  perilous times will come  for men will be lovers of themselves...   2 timothy 3 1-2 .
insane!!
noooo why don t they just focus on making the actual game work the way it should  imagine games 20 years from now guys
sup mel  keep winning
i don t know   hmm i played sims since sims 1 world changed. developers trying to some kind educate young populations. well i am not sure these days is that huge topic.  but i guess and agree even tans-gender people will create beautiful sim becomes that s them dream this what they wanna achieve. and be in that fantasy come on even me! when i creating my character in the game i makes character waaaaaaaaaaaaay  better version of me or something what i can just dream of.i feel is to early for children to see that.
i used to be on the same page with you  but lately i ve been watching you dwell deeper and deeper into something that s no longer just rational and common sense but it s turning spiteful instead. i really dont think you have a reason to be this bothered by it.
honestly  the entire bathroom issue is more of an engineering problem than a legal one. people prefer privacy in their bathrooms  build them in ways they don t even have to see another person. bam. entire debate shelved.
honestly  there s no need for a trans sim option  considering you can already  from the beginning  choose male or female options to be the sim you feel comfortable with. as a trans woman myself  i don t need a game to add trans like options for my sim in the game  when i already have the option of playing as a woman  and i can enjoy the game much more just like others games when i play as a female character  and the same can be said with anime games that have a gender select as well. this transgender update for the sims is pointless and i don t think ea should ve added this shit  especially when modders can do it themselves if they want.i just want to play as a female character in my games  that s all. we don t need the actual bs details a lot of us live with irl. games aren t meant to bring that to the table  they re meant to smash that shit into the pavement.
4 00 not true. i have autism and i want my sim to have autism aswell.jk.but i am on the spectrum and i get your point. it s these more woke bs.
ea is going broke .
remember some people love kill off the sims characters.sooooo.....yeaaaaah.
in the dead space remake there s a collectible in the form of a text diary a crew member of the ishimura wrote. they refer to another crew member named rousseu as  they  and  them  throught the page. i had to read the thing back 3 times before i figured out  rousseu  was not a group of people  but one blue haired wackjob.
i would love for all these woke warriors to play sims north korea. they would come back with either  not real communism!!!   yes it is   or they would wonder why they were playing that. i would just tell them that it didn t matter if they admitted it or not  a dystopian society just like what they have in the pdrk is the end product of their illogical thinking.
just finished uninstalling the sims from my children s pcs.  had to make room for hogwarts legacy anyway.
whoa wait a minute. i m not playing musical definitions where words mean something different. once you hit 10  you are a teen  pre -  already some added bs  the tens teens are the numbers between 9   20 . once you hit the mutation phase and are capable of reproduction  you are a young adult. once you hit age of consent  you are an adult. your body stops advancing by the age of 26 and changes gears  to neutral. in your 50 s it changes gears again into a state of degeneration unless you carefully manage it.mental maturity has every thing to do with how deep the lies and irresponsibility of those raising you reaches. this whole  oh you re a baby  when looking at an adult- is self hypnotism  reinforced thought patterns that are objectively a lie  that seed illusion into peoples minds.  this is the same process people go through to convince themselves they are in fact not the biological attribute their genetic code  xx or xy  dictates they are.
why  there are already have mods that people can install if they want that stuff. no need to add it in base game. they also have set the game to be free right before this add on.  kinda sounds like they have a motive.
i have to wonder if actual transgender people are happy with being seen as  trans  rather than just the gender they consider themselves to be. isn t the whole point that if you re born as a woman  for example  you actually want to be a man  or you feel like you should have been born a man instead  this is really just reminding these people that they ll always be  something else   not a man or a woman. i m not sure a lot of them are actually happy about that.
well how does one even do that with sinks to wash hands  and out of sight doesn t mean automatically safe either  a giant man can still attack a woman in another stall
@meloniemacgoboom  well  over here in central europe  i see more and more bathrooms that are essentially a set of one toilet  its own sink and a door. period. no need to even see another person. usually in smaller places  but you have this setup in very public venues like train stations or even some restaurants now. you lock the door  go about your business  wash your hands  exit and done. air vents take care of the stink. it s not capable of sustaining massive amounts of people  but  you rarely have a full bathroom anywhere unless it s at a club or concert anyway. so for most places  i see the stall model as being entirely unnecessary. and where it s necessary  you can still take steps to make stalls more secure  such as stable materials and not leaving them open at top and bottom  literally why is that even a thing with air conditioning all over  . plus  i sincerely hope that such places have security on site to deal with issues. security personell at restrooms during large events what should be mandatory. neatly sidesteps the entire debate  gets shit done  pardon the pun  and increases safety considerably. better to dark souls dodge the twitter mob in this case than to engage  imo.
right  itd be like me saying  i have seizures and schizophrenia. i want my sim to hear voices while dancing on the floor.  like no id want my sim to be very healthy
can t escape it even in a space horror game
imagine not understanding grammar  i m not native english speaker and even i understand that.
@josephsuazo9014  you know nothing about horror if this upsets you.
@funpolishfox5410  doesn t upset me  just takes me out of it.
@josephsuazo9014  just don t think about it  belive me  not giving shit can be good.
@funpolishfox5410  yeah  i ll just tell my brain to not give a shit when it gets confused by something  like what the op experienced. or me just last night in wow wondering why i was hearing a male voice coming out of a female looking character. it will always be there in the back of our minds when we see these things.
@josephsuazo9014  well  that is a problem you need to work out. if this shit really gets you  then you re clearly not ready for real world  i mean  really  you can t brush off the fact that someone may like to use female character  pls  take care.
@funpolishfox5410  know what  i actually agree. i would rather just not notice these things. but...with these things  it s always on the back of the mind  woke  tokenism  agenda.  maybe i look away when a gay couple kisses on screen  doesn t mean i can t still think the story is good but  the ideas remain in the mind still.
@josephsuazo9014  again  you need to just work it out. i used to have the same issue  until i started to question why it was bothering me.was it because i was actually disgusted  or was i told it was bad and internalized it questioning this just helps understand better yourself.i hope that you can understand why you think like this and you ll stop be bothered with things. it really makes things easier in life.
@funpolishfox5410  i don t think i can accept it  not out of hatred for these people  dude  i have a trans cousin that i love  but because i question whether it s good for even them. and i know these companies and the government don t care about anyone other than themselves. they re just being used and confused.
@josephsuazo9014  i see.well  still  i can t change it. it s your thing.really hoping everything will be okay. bless you  dear.
it really does look like it. i mean its rated t. if you add this make it rated a or only for people of adult ages
@buddingqueen  yeah it is now free so anyone can download it. not hidden behind a paywall.
oh and if be a male since i wear my boyfriends clothes at times
@buddingqueen   and therefore it makes your boyfriend gay or bi by their standards   which i doubt he would consent to it  right  all of this is just a clown world.
not everyone can download mods in the sims
@camilomadrigal27  guessing you talking about console players. but for pc there everywhere
as far as i know  this game has been nothing but a dumpster fire since it was released all the way back in the jurassic era. the game runs on ancient spaghetti code  and half the  packs  that you have to buy individually don t even work. the game is broken  the sequel to the sequel should be out by now  but this is what they re doing.i m surprised a competing title hasn t shown up to steal the market yet.
why has this form of mental illness permeated every bit of modern life  this gender dysphoria  up until very recently  was listed as a mental illness by the american psychiatric association. now because the apa has yielded to political   social pressures  it s something to strive for. doesn t the elevated suicide rate amongst these sufferers say something  maybe we should be treating them  instead of indulging them.
literally no one asked for this but of course we gotta appease the wokies in order to avoid getting death threats from them.
when a nation is so obsessed with sex that it shows up in video games for all ages  you know we are under god s judgment
to be honest the sims 4 has been an absolute joke since launch. it s not like the golden era of the sims 2 that was whacky and fun.ea is probably one of the worst tripple a game companies of the modern era
kudos for sticking to the christian message on this. soldiers of christ should always fight where the battle is hottest  correspondingly  its also where you draw the most fire  and to prevent being misquoted  every christian is considered a soldier in the army of god  but its a spiritual  and hence cultural  battlefield .
tweens are woke
affirmative health care is dangerous in every case of it  but we re told that in this one case  when it applies to  trans  people  that it s not. and not to listen to the many people who have spoken out about regretting their decision  because of their  internalized transphobia.  it s all  like 1 corinthians 3 19 says  foolishness and i m thankful everyday that the lord showed me this because i used to go along with all this. it makes me sad to watch people suffer from this  but what s more sad is that this is used to keep people away from god.
speak out with your wallet
what if the sims 4 gets an update to appease minor attracted persons you know what i m talking about.our society has become like the modern-day equivalent to sodom and gomorrah.widespread decadence and depravity is an early indicator for the collapse of civilization. this is what happened in rome shortly before it collapsed.
ok  i even play the sims from time to time. there are tons of things they could ve added to this game ahead of this transgender update that were in previous games. hearing aids    glucose monitor    there s not even a option for having deaf sims that i m aware of. wtf ea   even as a paid dlc  this makes no sense as opposed to just adding in content that was in previous games. if it was just the transgender option  i d still be put off about it but not as much. i mean the sims has always been a bit out there from the very first game release. also  i don t play sims to reflect myself or my life at all. that wouldn t be an escape for me and that idea is unappealing to me  i m proud of my life and accomplishments and family and friends but i don t want to simulate it in a game. i want to do something entirely different.....but certainly not this. nothing against transgender individuals or transgender individuals being able to recreate their own lives in the sims if they wish but the other parts of this update in conjuction to the transgender option for characters makes me agree that they are trying to push an agenda  not just give transgender individuals the opportunity to recreate their own lives and experiences in the game. sorry for the rant but great content melonie!
my character is a ken doll with a red flag from my favorite hole  in the ground at work
it won t be colorful with trans in ts4  let s say that someone is not a tolerant person and they get the opportunity to do literally whatever they want with their sim.
so back in the days  they wanted to ban mortal kombat other cases turned blood green coz  but what about the children !   but this is okey... !
okay  i just want to make sure we re fully able appreciate this level of insanity. up until this point  video game character customization features have almost always allowed players to choose their sex. no surgery  no hormones  just an option on a menu and you re done.now  seven years after marty mcfly went to the future with flying cars in it  some game dev got paid to make a 3d model of a guy wearing prosthetic accoutrements to look like a girl.at this point  it s like   what s your gender    the concept of being trans.
wait  does this make wow transphobic for making people pay for character transition
the real hate speech is telling people pretty lies that endanger their lives and facilitate their decent into hell. it s love speech when you care enough about someone to tell them ugly truths that can save their life or soul. keep on doing what you re doing  melonie! these people desperately need someone to tell them truths among all of the lies.
abby from the last of us 2 simulator
i applaud the sims for this. and the first scar they should allow is across the scalp from when trans players first remove their brains
really  necessary  what an update! h h h
can t believe this game released in 2014 and ea is still milking it
@psnpayback  yeah so society is so sexed up but teens not having unplanned pregnancies is because technology bad.people learn to overcome their own crap some do some don t i know i have trouble socializing but i don t think i would rather be getting stds and quite frankly my own sex drive is a hate relationship anyways.
@chandller burse  you give young teens too much credit. but i understand where you  as an individual  are coming from. let s hope more people are careful about such a huge responsibility sex is. like i said though  the topic is about transgender characters in a video game.
@psnpayback  the topic you presented is the nation is obsessed with sex.deep down i just can t drop the feelings humans really have no real good point.
@chandller burse  i think i m done here brother. may god bless you and your family
not everyone believes in the same religion as you or melonie though.they probably think the same being jews or muslims.you have to consider that and stop treating yourself in actual debates as the objective right one if you do that.i understand faith and belief but still it isn t helping anyone to tell them they are going to hell for being gay.
@chandllerburse737  for one thing  i don t have to consider or stop treating anything. poor way to put your point out there  pal. second  i don t do moral relativity. i believe what i believe  i believe it is right  and i don t owe anyone an apology or concessions for it. and finally  anyone with any less certainty in their faith should reexamine if actually they have any faith at all. no religion on earth says   it s ok to be half-in and just ignore the parts you don t like.  not trying to be mean  but it does not actually sound like you  understand faith and belief  at all.
idgaf what adults wanna do to themselves  play with your hormones and damage yourself  but stay f ing away from kids. the grooming examples are all over yet ppl make excuses instead of calling it because then they ll have to think hard about their beliefs.
i am sure transgender people are  thrilled  about being reminded they aren t real male female. seriously  though  the only people who benefit from this are the people pushing this ideology. you can influence children to think they  might not be  the sex they were born as  but you cannot convince trans people that it would be  better  to sim being trans than simming being the sex they identify as. there are only victims in this change  both the trans people who are hurt by the reminder  and the cis children who are hurt by the confusion.
damn. was going to buy most of the content after 4 wrapped up and it all started going to discount. guess i ll just save my money  this feature would make story progression mode a nightmare for narrative play styles.
business as usual in gaming. bahaha. everything is getting so insanely demonic.
huh  a bunch of terms i didn t understand in this video  regarding the medical jargon  but i think i understand. it s basically the scars that are left after transitional surgery  correct yeah  it s a bit jarring to have your sims rock that. especially the teen ones. i have no issue with transgender people and if they want to undergo a change  more power to them  but putting kids through that is just wrong. they barely know themselves  and people let 11 year olds go through such a massive change that will throw a wrench into their developing hormones  um  no.and even if me and melonie seem to disagree on the change aspect  i do agree with her on the videogame character aspect. unless it s a cool battle scar  i wouldn t want my dark souls character  for example  to rock a medical scar. and i certainly wouldn t want said character to have an unhealthy thin body  even if it may fit the world to be a husk. poor thing would fold like a castle of cards harder than patches against the first hollow mob.
big fan  mel. but i can t bring myself to watch this episode. the title tells me all i need to know. i have a 15yr old neice who plays this game... not for much longer.
my biggest problem is that they started doing this since like 2019  forced woke updates that should be optional  because in a lot of cases they cause huge problems with what you have already created. thats when i had to stop buying dlc-s and stop updating the game for good.
this is why i mostly play japanese games like digimon and kingdom hearts.
this constant need to see ourselves in games is asinine. i suffer from crohns disease  why would i want a sim that has the same ibd  fiction is supposed to be idealized versions of people  not the gimpy sick ones.
them   bigot! transphobe! me   ok  and
this game has been so woke its absurd. every character in their marketing is a pink haired flaming minority with septum rings.
oh no god save us whatever will we do now
i m very much an lgbtq  ally  but i m also a big fan of you and i regardless of whether i agree with your views. i ll always enjoy your gaming and news videos. you re generally a very beautiful  talented  and respectful woman.
melonie is phobic and expresses hate.   yup  she fears god and hates sin. and i bet she is a really kind person also.
many people like to imagine they are playing games as themselves. now more people can do that whilst playing the sims.
not my livelong beloved series t.t i hate humanity
i hate creating myself in the sims because they tell me i have to be an elder.  elders die so fast.  unfair.
so they  fixed  a lot of bugs yeah  i think they left a few in. . . .
they want to create more people like them so they feel less lonely and more validated. it s narcissistic disorder but it s not being treated as such.
can t you do all sorts of immoral things in the sims  things worse than gender politics  most videogames have a gameplay loop involving murder and violence so...i don t like marxist gender politics but videogames are already spiritual poison on many levels  this is just a drop in the bucket and being offended over it makes you look like you either lack perspective or are a hypocrite.
thank you so much!
i saw this update yesterday  that pissed me right the heck off! if sims was a rated m for mature game then i wouldn t be upset about it  i would just make fun of it instead  but this is rated for 13  for teens  so many impressionable young kids will see this  heck  even kids that are not old enough to play rated 13  games play sims  so they will see this too  and then a good amount of them will want to become trans and get those operations. makes me so angry and sick! shame on ea! i decided years ago that i would not give a single cent to ea and i m sticking to it! ea is full of groomers confirmed! thank you so much for covering this  mel! i love your playstation hoodie! blue looks good on you! i m beginning to think every color looks good on you.
is ea doing this to sell more sims 4 copied because there have been mods that do this exact thing. i don t play the sims 4 that much due to it basically being the sims 1.5 due to the lack features the 4th has. but if you make a sim and creat their backstory and everything why do this update
i m getting tired of games getting changed and to allow this to be seen by kids is honestly scary for me to see this. i do not believe this game is rated teen anymore this has become an adult game and has in ways made gaming not as fun. this is why i don t play a lot of these type of games anymore. this needs to be stopped. love your life but stop trying to push ideals on people that don t want to see it. i m all about living your life but children need to be kept out of it. i want gaming to be left alone but it is curious to see what is next.
why cant you just let people be happy how is this affecting you
my dad was a fire and brimstone southern baptist as he grew up and i was raised spirit filled pentecostal and i remember hearing them talk abt this stuff years and years ago and now its reality.  i trust in god in all things and i feel he led me to this channel because i have had things on my heart.  so i am grateful to you and keep being you and youre doing a good job
i don t like any of this bs. it s just so creepy and makes no sense. the trans people who actually did it for a full gender change and could actually pass as a female  usually aren t the type to have an avatar like that. as for the bathroom thing  i feel for the real ladies that aren t comfortable with this. my opinion is this. kind of an intermediary. similar to conceal carry  the whole point is no one knows you have a gun on you. in a similar vein  i couldn t fault a trans lady who actually could pass as a lady from entering a ladies bathroom. since the whole point is a gender change and some of them you could pass on the street and never know. but of course all the creepos that won t pass well would have a fit over it.
i was sickened when swtor added facial hair to the human female models so trans trenders could feel included. like  no one needs that junk. now the sims do this woke crap.
this is just sad. doubly so because i can t boykott ea any more than i already do.
just do what other games are doing and select body type a or b therfore you could play the character as trans if you want too without being  hey look trans
i bet any of these so called  parents  that allow their children to be mutilated would flip out if that said child got a tattoo or a piercing. the hypocrisy of it all! and that wasn t a comment against tattoos i m covered i just mean it s funny they are ok with ruining their child s life but would prolly freak out over ink
honestly  i don t see why any of this is bad especially the medical wearables.yes  they added this stuff to force an agenda onto players but at the same time  it allows sims to not all look exactly the same. you could just choose not to use the items you don t like but there s no harm in having the items in the game.
why are there so many adults so interested in the sexuality of children and teens  why is it so okay for those adults to be that interested  as long as it falls under the lgbtq  arena  in normal circumstances  people would find it extremely unacceptable if an adult where to be interested in the sexuality of a child or teen.
wow good job ea.i m really looking forward to the ssri and assisted suicide update.sims 4 was already worse than sims 3  i m officially done with sims.
so is this a free update or paid  ... because if it s free i will be pissed! they make everything expanded paid  but if this is free i will have to say why ! but i already know why..
you seem to forget that disabled people and trans people do actually exist and would like to be represented. i actually love this update. if you don t like the features don t use them in your game!
i deem this  gr00mergate
come on girl get real. it s a video game. trans people exist and this content you don t have to wear in your sim. this tone you re projecting isn t it. you re adding to the miserable undertone.
it s a life simulator. it doesn t matter if you like it or support it  but trans-people exist in real life. so it makes perfect sense for them to be in a life simulator game. you claim the woke mob is so easily triggered yet you loose your shit and have some kind of breakdown on a tiny optional addition to a life simulator game.
sad  sad people. why does the idea that a group of people can finally make themselves in a life simulator game bother you so so much
i wouldn t want my sims going to church because what would be the point  not everything has to be exactly like the people playing. this generation are insanely narcissistic
where at in the south
i never liked fire and brimstone preachers as a christian people want to pull the  hard truths  but most of them sound like they just like screaming about hell and instilling fear in people it doesnt seem supportive or manageable like the bible commands pastors and deacons to be.i also wonder how many even give proper sermons and lessons. just screaming at me as a kid about hell would only encourage me to leave as someone with autism and honestly has always hated being yelled at due to my father and other things. i wouldn t set foot in a screaming church.not to mention it reminds me of those religious scammers like peter popoff who yells and tries to  heal  people except he never does.
@chandllerburse737  ya he didn t either so that s why i was raised differently
@mohawk_productions  my family isn t in the south anymore or at least the part of his family i do know
wow  i used to play that game years ago. looks like they did it at the end of 2021  pretty much when every other western company did similar things. reason for this is two factors  majority of aaa developers nowadays are far left  and also higher ups in the company are chasing esg score. that s why you see this everywhere.personally i stopped playing anything from the west around 2020 and cancelled all subs i had  like humble monthly one . now i play only kr  jp and even cn games like upcoming honkai star rail. there is none of that there.
the game basically had that option already but you can never be too woke these days
these are not remotely inappropriate to have in a game for children
i doubt your honesty
@patrickhenry8425  why is that
@meloniemacgoboom  woohoo isn t very appropriate for children yet that s in the game. medical things and binders are significantly less inappropriate than that.either way  the game is meant to simulate life  it wasn t made to be safe for children in the first place
@pinkchu116  that you felt the need to affirm you are being honest.  are you not normally honest
@patrickhenry8425  no. i m saying that i m disagreeing with her because normally  i don t.
@pinkchu116  you are conflating adding surgically mutilated characters with adding medical devices.either mistakenly or disingenuously.either way   it isn t honesty
@patrickhenry8425  no  i didn t say that trans people and medical devices are the same things. i m saying that it doesn t matter that they added either of the items for said groups. and i said this with my honest opinion making my statement honest. do you understand how to read or am i missing something
@pinkchu116  i understand how to read. i also point out bullshit.  can you understand that
@patrickhenry8425  does it matter what they choose to put in their own game  like bro  i don t get what you re so upset about.
@patrickhenry8425  what i said isn t bs. i just stated what i think and i think that it doesn t matter if they added these things into the game because if you don t like it  you could just not play or not use those items. it s as simple as that.
@pinkchu116  people like you are why i don t involve myself in the sims 4 community even though i play it a lot
@mrmistah1588  wdym  people like you   what did i do
@pinkchu116  we can agree on that. you don t get it.
@patrickhenry8425  i m definitely not the one who doesn t get it lmao.
@patrickhenry8425  it s so funny how when you people can t win an argument  you go straight to insulting as if that s doing you any good.
thank you
someone said it. thank you. this video.. i got a minute in and knew it was gonna be transphobia all over the place
in future news  the sims 4 gets updates to appease those interested in incest and bestiality.
hey just wanted to show u support sis ur a great woman  i got alot of respect for u we r fam and i will always have ur back god bless  it would be cool to meet u irl sometime just to chat   i m pretty chill lol   i just recently ordered a ps1 bundle with tr 1 2 and 3  i m gonna be playing through all of them on lara croft s birthday and celebrate our girl  peace and love...go boom
they could have at least made this a feature in the sims 5.......i mean....come on.  i mean...if i was the marketing team...i would make it so that the sims 5 is all about the alphabet...that way...i can keep playing sims 4 without the 5.
puberty blockers    glucose monitor   surgery scars   i don t even play video games and this seems weird to me.
i m surprised they didn t add the trans option to babies.
i still don t want blaire white using the women s restroom.
and i was so tempted to buy the sims when it went on sales cuse it looked to be enjoyable but now they want to go woke. it sealed the deal not to buy it.
hahahahahahahaha this is funny....they re more then trying they r wrecking everything on purpose
i ve lost interest on the sims when i played sims 4 a few days upon its released date and hearing this update no doubt will do the same on  sims 5
big pharma and big medical.
finally! now i can play as a gay trans deaf diabetic cat in a wheelchair!  how many covid jabs can my sim get
and of course  the gender-focused stuff can t be a dlc  it s got to be a base-game update.
so it wasnt enought to make the character creator non gender  its never enough gees!
-------  wo_man beard  need i say more
well no more sims for me
they are grooming children. and should be a damn crime.
he next dlc will b a strap on
stop the world  i want to get off.
are certain people trying to removing the need for imagination
they are actually still making sims games
it s called interspecies erotica
you re so amazing  thank you!
@meloniemacgoboom  oh absolutely no prob ur very much welcome
they ve always been woke
go woke go broke i guess
i haven t played the sims since sims 2
i like that jumper
hi melonie you look awesome in the playstation hoodie i like xbox and playstation but xbox is more special to me because of fable dead or alive ninja gaiden and halo and gears thoughts on those game series
lmao now im glad i never played the sims
electronic arts stock price dropped 10 percent today. coincidence
yupi don t think it even uses the words  man   woman  anymore evenmale and female either
by my point of view everything as become super nasty and cringe and evil since the criminals installed the puppet
ea...it  in the shame...
i deleted the game because it kept crashing on my ps4. my ps4 was just looking out for me little did i know
i pirated the game due to the ridiculous costs of the add ons which total several hundred dollars  now i don t need to feel guilty about not handing over my money.
wow  they haven t even added cars yet. smfh.
in the nineties very short gay man in bathroom and accepted by the 3 women  it must be unfair
i hope theres a option where i can turn off this feature
for the love of...
oh no they didn t! the gaming industry is going down the toilet.
the sims is still a thing
nothing special it s ea they ve always been like this for the last 10 years.
you re late to the party this isn t new they just added content. the trans content has been in the game since about a year or so  after release. also they literally just stole mods and added it to console versions.
cut my hair .. and take me to church..
i m only mad they don t make it a paid dlc like everything else they make paid dlc. if they are going to be inclusive at least be equal
hahahhahaahahahahahahaha aaaaah this world is doomed
can i ask for a roll call on how old some of you commenters are  i just need hope that young people are watching this and not fallen down this path. god help us all.
enjoy your life with legitimate relations. that which you choose and foster according your morals and values and genuine relations. most important aspect of life. fakes like fakes. its simply not same .
to be fair the sims has always tried to include everyone. so  i don t mind an update like this. i don t believe the trans stuff but hey it s whatever.
at a distance your title reads like  the sins and transgender update .
i have to update my game manually because of reasons   anyway im not updating anymore.
don t give this company any money.
oh that s wat that update was about   smh
ea
it s just a video game!
what is this world..
the @ work
this update will make happy at least 2 of those 5 transgender that play the game. at least until their detransition.
pure evil.
savages!!!!!
people just need to learn to start telling the truth again. this isn t normal  it s a turn off for most  and it is disturbing. these were accepted truths that have now been changed for no scientific reason.
christ almighty  its a game!
no. this isn t being pushed as being normal... no patterns to notice here  people..all just a big coincidence.
every day we stray further from god
well when you have kids who raised by the government and raised by televisions and ipads  none of this surprises mei didn t even have my first smartphone until i was 18
i could never send children to modern public school. this is beyond a joke. you think it will improve soon
this is the wayalso mods to remove the trash will be made fast
this is not gaming  it s mockery
isn t this what they re trying to prevent this is like giving them a restroom for trans they are not supposed to be fighting this they do not make their mind
lol they re trying to be inclusive
troons
yikes  just yikes
the simps. that joke been done already  ah  pooey.
oh  for the love of all that is holy...
yet another franchise i m done with rip the sims smh
for f cks sake
yeah this is why i don t play sims anymore. at least not the 4th one. the older ps2 games were so much better.
this is why i quit playing
games are meant for escapism and basic entertainment  not grooming  and not whatever...this is...
loev you
kill me now
yesss
i m gonna be sick
the sims 4 is still inferior to the sims 3. also  sims medieval really deserved a sequel to expand on the concept.
this is cultural marxism
no such thing as tramsgemder. it s a lie
and now i will never play the sims again. done with the indoctrination.
i hope parents riot over this  would never let my kids play the sims 4 now. the older ones are better.
man  i don t know what i did to have this channel pop up in my feed  it s the tucker carlson of gaming
stop listening to fake influencers that are not fans nor gamers
sadly i was having fun playing sims 4 for a good long while but now it s time to uninstall sims 4.
never played any of sims games and this update definitely won t be fixing that. who was pounding the table for this  this is just dumb
i want fucking cars  in sim 3 the world is like a sanbox and you have cars  but noooo in sims 4 we have a medical boushit  xd.
algorithm.
reminder  there is no such thing as non-binary.
i m diabetic  and the last friggin thing i want to see in a video game is a goddamn glucose monitor. this sjw crap is going waaaay too far.
it s just virtue signaling in its purest form.
no parent should let their kids play the sims...not now... i grew up with games like sims bustin  out. and the sims was totally different back then. now it s a horrile game for kids to play. and it s only going to get worse. because they are pandering to thee worst kind of people.
geez.  i used to like the sims games.  but not now.  ea is not good for games any more.
just another company to stop supporting.
why would you want this
quit trying to create a moral panic with video games.
its a game its not that serious
idk why anyone even plays the sims unless they have obtained a copy with all the dlc included and no drm. ea has the audacity to have thousands of dollars worth of dlc for the sims in the hopes kids use their parents credit card to buy all of them and now they are pushing the troon agenda. yikes
here today   conservatives find out people come in different shapes  !!!!!!
is ur stalker in jail
it s out of control due to cowards ceaselessly trying to  be respectful  to these mutants. too few seem to grasp the danger that these creatures pose to the future of humanity. they want to destroy everything our foremothers and fathers have built.. and your kind are letting them.
why is it virtue signalling
@user-sr3go9uh5g  because  as she says in the video  there s literally no point to it. a trans player would just play as the opposite sex because the fact that they re trans means they identify with the opposite sex. they wouldn t want the game to remind them that they aren t that sex when games are supposed to be a form of escapism. so the only possible reason they d do this is to say  hey look! we re being inclusive! praise us!
what s a conservative according to you because i m not a conservative.
@mrmistah1588  what are you then  an alien
@16vagabond  yes
nope  and he s still social media stalking me
@meloniemacgoboom   have  the police dropped  it   please b safe
i should have refound my source before double commenting here yesterday. platform- rumbl  user- reese report  video title- gateway process  the cia  and mankinds hidden potential.5 minutes long and the only thing he fails to nail down is the sentience that encompass  all  that you have 3 names for  god  jesus  and christ.
never been into sims and won t be playing it
it s freakin everywhere... can we have anything that s not tainted with this garbage
not supriced at all......
nothing will escape this weaponized social disease. we are living in sodom and gomorrah. we will suffer the same fate.
absolutely disgusting!
stick to eating butter sticks love
i have the game....hope this is an option i can turn off. smh.

i pirated the game i wont get tat update
feck  is there an option to opt out of the trans stuff
rated t for trans
these people are sick. i just got booted from the gamexplain discord for being against child mutation.
huh
haven t played sims in ages  when i saw this my reaction wtf is this.  totally not needed.  teens and the younger ones who play do not need to be exposed to this  they are way to impressionable.  probably was the wacko parents that pushed this for clout.  they most likely don t even play it and just wanted to well...warp the minds of the young to further their agenda along.  sickening.
i don t play sims
a game  where you can create any kind of character...why make it trans and not the gender desired
lgbtqhdmi4kquality is just another way of saying you re disabled
like why ruin ya franchise
or you can just not use it
@camilomadrigal27  huh  i ve played the game for years....not going to stop playing it just cause of one stupid feature.
@steveo5568  i meant to say is just ignore the things in this update lol
tbf the sims is a far left liberal franchise but there s definitely an agenda
all i hear was light switch and scars. and yes most definitely people in the sims community ask for this. they are borderline psycho.
can this get any more worse than it is right now  anyway i thought by now that sims video game company can come up with better sims video games then this. anyway this is awful and sad and terrible. anyway i am so happy that i will never be willing to play this video game ever again now that it is getting worse now after they add transgender people to the game. anyway i don t have anything else to say bout this topic then i am so sad and upset and angry and mad at this sims video game company for bringing up with this crap thing to the game. anyway i just want to make a comment about this topic of your video  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
thanks for the heads up. i will delete this game from my library asap.
you could already choose which gender of your sim. why would you want to be stuck in the wrong gender intentionally  it s so dumb.
i m the first to watch the video
great so now i can finally live out my dream of becoming transgender with the sims said no one ever
this is worse than velma it ruined my childhood wtf
hows the right-wing grifter paycheck
maybe the devs should focus less on obsessively adding lgbtq content and more on making a game that works.
you can choose your gender already  there s no reason for this to exist in the game  other than the message. thank god my kids think all this stuff is stupid.
i a right there with you on this. they to stop putting this topic into everything. we need people double think their genders  we need to the media to go back to where it was just 2 genders  and where personality was just personality  and stop sexualizing everything.
i don t give a shit about playing the sims.
oh boy! i was over at a youtubers channel  and is a sim content creator  lilsimsie   and their comments are very excited about this. my thought  underwhelming but ok  decent patch  the point she lost me is- she spoke out to a dev saying  ....alot of young children will be influenced by this  oh fucking boy did i think groomer.
lol i won t be buying it
trans people choosing not their  identified  gender  but instead their trans gender in a game  prove they actually just want to be  special .
isn t this a step backward  why wouldn t you just make a male or female character  isn t that what the trans is  trans into man or woman.  transition  idk i m just confused on this one..... like i want my character to be an elf  so wouldn t i just make him an elf.... not a human playing an elf................
this is a video game  it s not real  video games do not affect reality. you don t become a murderer by playing gta or fps and by the same token you don t become trans by an optional content in a video game. ffs enough of blaming video games for problems in the real world
ea cashin more this is just money for this company they dont care about lgbt for them is just money they never care about kids they have loot box in there games kids pay a lot for those loot box  and the lgbt think ea care for adding this to the game. ea you are the king of making money
and it s a base game update. so you can t opt out of it. it just happens
don t let your kids play this horrible game
....also their are numerous comments saying  i have diabetes  my brother is trans  and i m disabled in a wheelchair  etc. i think  man  you are going through some life difficulties  why do you want it in your game to  and not something like more vampire stuff   and the response is  makes me feel more human    you didn t feel human before a sims patch     maybe if you stop thinking you need to change your gender you would feel a bit more human first.
one word propaganda
here little sim..come into this small box with no windows  full of fireplaces  and soon to be no exit
memba when they said   let us get marry     i  memba the slippery slope is not a fallacy  we re living in it.
omg i love the sims well used to now i m stop playing it now bc they added this stuff  i play this game to escape reality but looks like reality just stormed its way into my game . well i m done.
first.
trans people in the sims makes sense  but rated for teens  if you re too young to drink alcohol  you re too young to commit to life changing medical procedures and that is what this kind of thing is promoting  yeah we should respect everyone  teenagers included  potentially hurting teenagers to  be kind  to barely 1  of the population makes no sense.
im glad i never liked the sims game.
people love to focus on things that really aren t problems. y all are so childish and angry over the wrong things.
that is the sad reality. they are mostly creepy angry older men who have nothing going in life who suddenly found the entire industry behind them
seeing this makes me regret wasting my money on this garbage..i wish i could get a refund the sims used to be great until those woke mentally ill people got involved
seriously  who asked for this
i don t want my daughter growing up  being confused about who she is in terms of her gender at 3 yrs old because of this woke mob crap!! even in middle school  you shouldn t be telling kids that they can change their gender and take hormone blockers to avoid puberty pains or whatever it s supposed to do. i know that sounds a little ignorant but in all honesty  i don t know much about it but i feel that it s wrong and it shouldn t be shoved down our children ls throats or in front of their faces everywhere they look. i feel a decision to take such medications and undergo sex change surgeries should be reserved for adults 22 and up. no exceptions  and it should be a federal law that you can t provide these medications or surgeries to anyone who isn t over the age of 21. real talk
citizen  please be prepared to receive our next propaganda update  failure to accept and cheer on the update will result in public chastising and shaming  obey!
ugh gross! i m not going to play this game anymore. why did they do this    just why    why are they making the game woke  i hate it
this is disgusting. i am at a loss a as to why this crap has to be in a game. i guess if companies want to lose money  then keep this degusting crap up.
marketing self harm to minors is a weird strategy  let s see how it works out for them i guess
i think i might be transphobic. all the transgenders scare the living hell out of me. most appear to get their look from silent hill.
sims 4 has always been shit and this just makes me want to play it even less.
uninstalling the sims  rather than buying any expansion packs. gross. sick. evil. trash game.
guys i found the pick me
me
@camilomadrigal27  first off  if you re a transgender wouldn t you prefer to simply play as the opposite gender you were born in without this stuff
@hezekiahduckworthy8867  yes but i want to make myself in the sims
i don t relate to it  so why are you talking on it idk
damn i try to get away from the left wing nuts and find myself on the flip side of their coin. left  right . y all both cry about so much and blame it on some self righteous reason
game about fake lives  now has fake genders  as well. mildly amusing.
in regard to people having to use the bathroom of their biological gender  what do you do in cases where people genuinely pass as the opposite gender  i know it s rare  but it does happen. if i saw blair white in a men s restroom and i didn t know who she was  i would think that there was a woman in the men s room. likewise  there are some trans men who  if you saw them in a woman s restroom  you would think that there was a man in the woman s restroom. so what do you do in cases like that  you can t have them pull down their pants and prove it.
i never gonna get this transgender stuff. it s a video game! if people want to change the gender of their character  why not just make a new character
i have all the sims games except the sims 4  how disgusting.there is only 2 genders man and woman everything else is a choice.
as a lifetime t2 diabetic i am deleting sims today im sick of this trans bullshit.
who allowed this garbage in the sims
is it a surprise that the world get more depraved  we were foretold this by he who knows the end from the beginning.
guess you re a transphobe if you don t buy the expansion packs or have a cisgender sim...
so other people shouldn t have the option to make their fantasy characters the way they want because you believe the game should be played as an ideal character from your dreams  get out.
oh no  they re transing the kids by adding binders in a video game  girl  stop being so hateful
i just played for first time in like 7 months.. and found out they added.. pronouns...
sims is trash  nothing interesting in this game  ya re creating the whole character or family for a few hours  to don t know what to do exactly  where s the main goal of this game  main point
sims hasn t been good since sims 2 sims 3 era glad i stopped playing this garbage
sony sux
i miss the days where everything didn t have to involve a gay or trans character.
this is why an additional gender neutral bathroom is needed or something  because this is not only impossible to regulate  but also so extremely rare of a situation
@meloniemacgoboom  maybe  but i don t think a lot of small businesses can afford to have a third bathroom installed for a very rare situation that may never even come up. and even for the big corporations like walmart that could afford to put third bathrooms in all of their stores  it s still an excessive undertaking for something that wouldn t come up very often in most of their stores.
cry about it
im going back to d d and board games  video games are getting less and less tolerable to play  good luck companies with your suck gaymes
i think you are beautiful   but come on  wearing a playstation hoodie  you need to get a xbox hoodie
i couldn t give two craps what adults do  it s the fact that this is marketed toward children and available to children characters that is the problem.
@meloniemacgoboom  how is playing a fantasy character going to harm kids  if anything  they are probably going to be more understanding towards different kinds of people if they get to experience different kinds of fantasy people in a game.
it s a life simulation  there is no goal.
@camilomadrigal27  alright  so it s the worst simulator i ever played in my entire life
disgusting!!!!  won t be buying anymore sims games.go evil and unnatural  go broke!
your video is very hateful....comparing ppl and saying who passable or not. i can t believe you sit here judge. your tone went from saying your opinion to being hateful and bitter. showing 2 diff ppl and saying who looks more like woman vs another is hurtful.
if they re putting in self-mutilation like this  the age rating needs to be 18. currently  it is 12...
ok first of all this game is for teens not kids secondly you upset with this but people being burned  drowned  and electrocuted in the game is fine  hypocrite
keep crying
so with all the bugs . this is what we adding      lol virtual signaling again and don t even care about the fans they have now lol
sincerest apologies but why do you care so much about a few pieces of pixel clothing  plus  this update didn t even add trans and nonbinary sims  you re way late to the party if you want to talk about that. and about the  not wanting your kids to play this   sims 4 is rated teen  you said this yourself. and why do people think being trans is inherently sexual and inappropriate for minors  i don t understand that.
doesn t matter whose feelings are hurt when we are discussing the safety of women and children. that matters far more than someone getting their feelings hurt  we have to accept reality.
@meloniemacgoboom  but this video was about sims game . not posting and comparing ppl personal photos. there natural women who have strong features.....how is it safe and non safe....having softer features doesn t mean women and children will be safe. end of day...a person cruel  evil unsafe actions has nothing to do with there features. saying cause one looks one way....your safe vs another ...is hate speech.
you can literally burn and drown children in this game  but surgery is where you draw the line
virtual signaling  try again
