forspoken is what happens when you let a californian write an isekai.
it s so weird. japanese companies initially see worldwide success because a large audience of westerners appreciate the japanese culture  style  and methods of storytelling. their response   we must be more like westerner to appease westerner!  i just... i don t... we love you guys for being unapologetically japan  not wannabe american!
she calls the final boss a  gaslighting sack of shit  during the final battle.
not only i m holding square enix accountable for their actions  i m also blaming the corrupt ethics department of square enix
square enix will learn a painful lesson  but a valuable one.
i don t even know how it s possible to make dialogue this bad but they really showed us it s possible. keep it jrpg!! we love japanese entertainment!!
all i hear is i  i  i  i  basically represent all virtue signallers
i spend most of my time these last few years learning as much as i can about politics and media bias  and my only real time to escape from all that nonsense is when i sit down for an hour or three a day and engross myself in a good video game. now that they are relentlessly shoving thier politics and indoctrination in my face in that realm as well  i am more determined than ever to help take back our cultural spaces from these ideological bullies.
the look on melonie s face while watching the gameplay explains everything. one giant facepalm.
when i first saw the protagonist i was trying so hard to not write it off as a  western-sensitive  game  but then when she started talking i couldn t take it anymore. it is so sad cuz the game itself looks so promising in concept  but of course i can just feel the  americanization  all over it
the reveal trailer looked cool. put it on my wishlist. played the demo. removed it from my wishlist.
by the way  this is the kind of dialogue you write when you re scared to death of offending someone somewhere. how s that saying go  you don t need free speech to talk about the weather  lol. just have your character tell the audience what s going on and every single inane thought they come up with in their lobotomized head. there s also the possibility that the writers are amateurs who ve been hired for something other than their talent. gotta hit those quotas  boys and girls.
japanese companies have the same problem that all companies do  people are in charge who don t understand why customers like their product.
ok  that is something i do now . this is a unholy synergy of cringe inducing dialog and impossibly smug delivery. i love how bad it is
i think i want us to go back to the era of silent protagonists.
the last time square tried to appeal to a western audience was 2001 and it nearly bankrupted them  final fantasy  the spirits within  forcing them to merge with enix as a result.
the pain....  the pain!!!  on a serious note  i saw the writing on the wall with this one a long time ago.  changing from a what looked to be a tech demo to a full fledged game definitely made it look like something was missed in the transition.
there is something called the  uncanny valley effect  that is generally applied in robotics to the uneasy feeling we get towards the human like appearance we try to recreate with robots  i believe that applies here as well. that s the reason why 3d artists need to make these adjustments.
they changed the byline on the playstation store from  her story begins!  to  your fight begins.  they know what they got.
i tried the forspoken demo  and there was too many things going on the screen. dialogue aside  trying to figure out the menus  the controls  and the largely empty open world was disappointing enough to save me  70.
we need to wall that state off and make sure no food gets in
the californians snl
they took amy hennigs concept for this games world and ruined it!
@enalb5085  i was thinking we could go fracking for oil at the fault line and see if we can speedup its removal from the mainland.
this might as well be velma the video game  lol
@enalb5085  i wish  too bad the entire middle of california has enough food for the planet  we need to conquer the state and secure its resources again lol
@_..d  no i stay away from there if i was you and they say business or pleasure you said both you want to live remember no threat that s a warning if you make waves they will check you
i m a southern californian and i approve of this message!
i m a californian  and i approve this message  lol
in all seriousness  is cali a lost cause  i m so frustrated with them  not everyone of course  i know many are kind  based  and genuinely normal people .
this is a false read in a big way.  what motivated the making of this game i don t know  but if you look at the actual games square enix is releasing you will see they are releasing tons of jrpg s that are very japanese.  this game is not a trend  it is a one off  in gameplay  ip  and well.... everything.
literally this!
@karkarov  they aren t  tho i get so tired of the square defense force most of the jrpgs they have released in the past 5 to 10 years have been multi-platform re-releases or shit like kingdom hearts 4 and ff7r. they have essentially dropped all traditional jrpgs outside of the occasional game like triangle strategy and tactics ogre re-release . they aren t 90s square anymore stop defending their practices. this is the same company with over 7 ff7 spinoffs and nfts planned they re creatively bankrupt
@karkarov  they got lucky a gem like near automata dropped into their laps
i mean  japanese very often make their products a bit  less japanese . not too much  just a bit. think of the silent hill games. you can tell it s got japan written all over. and yet its a series of games that conform to a lot of typical western common places.
fromsoft did it so they want to.
hajime tabata who actually pitched this game in 2018 said it s absolutely unrecognizable now to what he pitched then.  this game is the epitome of westernized localized modern garbage.
@mexicansnohablo  lol.  sorry i forgot you had to look like an snes game to be a jrpg.  i will just pretend there is no octopath sequel this year  no ff16  they didn t release triangle strat last year either.  no dragon quest games came out recently either.yeap just westernized bs  that s all square makes.
oh great another weebo.
this is square enix we re talking about here. they re called the ea of japan for a good reason.
they should rename it to forgotten
it s called portal fantasy. you don t need a fucking japanese name for something that has a long history in the west. thomas covenant  narnia  the wizard of oz....the japanese did not invent this.
@enalb5085  and ban them from the internet
@user-vy6xh1ro7s  long history  you ve named three things  and i ve only even heard of two of them  enjoyed them  but again that s two . i just don t see the west making as many stories in that genre. plus  there are different tropes between isekai and what you re calling portal fantasy. in the former  for example  it s almost always a one-way trip  usually requiring death . the latter  as the name suggests  usually involves traveling to and from worlds.
hajime tabata who actually pitched this game in 2018 said it s absolutely unrecognizable now to what he pitched then when he left few months after. this game is the epitome of westernized localized modern garbage.
@user-vy6xh1ro7s  oh please. what garbage marvel   garbage starwars   garbage comic books or garbage hollywood  which one is the pinnacle  the only thing we have left is video games and they re slowly ruining that too. not saying the west doesn t make great shows  movies or games once in a while. but i m saying the quality has dramatically dropped.
@user-gy1yk7fo6x  then you need to educate yourself. oz was published in 1900. if that ain t long ago enough for you then go back a few decades more to a little story called alice in wonderland. ever heard of it portal fantasy makes no specification with regard to bi-directional transportation. but if we accept that that japanese word thing requires no return trip  then you ve offered yet another reason why the word shouldn t be used here because frey does gain the ability to make it back to new york.
@purefoldnz3070  oh great  another pizza cutter with no point.
@enalb5085  not the entirety of the state  just la  san fran  etc. the rest of the state is mostly sane.
@nightshadehelis9821  yesas a brit cali was sold to us in the 80s and 90s as the place where the streets was paved with gold all the beautiful people lived there all the cool and new stuff happened there 1st but then i grew up and found out about a place called oakland and was like bruh...you know when you grow up when you dont want to move to america anymore.
it s understood that hollywood sells californication    rhcp
@enalb5085  lol.. california produces most of the food in the united states.
pretty much lmao. it s just teen chick flick dialogue.
an average chinese light novel about cultivation and isekai is 10 times more interesting story than this game.
not really. its just bad writing. the isekai genre really isn t new. its a mix of otherworlds and power fantasy. like the divine comedy  dante s inferno   the chronicles of narnia  and even harry potter  in the sense of discovering a  magical world   urban fantasy s  discovering a hidden world  is a stone s throw from going to a new one   have all done the isekai format long before. as well as several other western and eastern stories and just a bunch of stories from everywhere. just call it out for what it is. bad writing. if anything this is more like what happens when people try to copy the mcu  the writing there isn t good  if they weren t expensive disney action movies with recognizable ip they d be dead in the water  and frankly the amount of lamp shading has always been straight up insulting  .
@enalb5085  sounds good to me. we in california agree. maybe your government can stop taxing our state so much.we ll see how quickly you mess the relief you have had from low taxes in some states not to mention the trade and economy of the country. sounds great to us.
@phillych3zst3ak  etc
hahahahha this is perfect.
a better title for the game should be  that time a californian was reincarnated in another world .
@enalb5085  they ve got food.. but restrict the supply of condoms and hiv meds  and i think the solution would finalize itself in short order..
@purefoldnz3070  you say that as if it is a slight. i take it as a compliment!
@dkarkarov  square enix literally said they want to boost their esg score by  making socially responsible games .
@user-vy6xh1ro7s  no  fromsoft did not.fromsoft just made a fantasy game. with lore written by a westerner  which happened to fit nicely into the souls style of story telling. also  i m pretty sure from doesn t have an ethic department overseeing their game development.  they might  but you ve not heard much about it.
@guillermodominguezdelafuen2730   typical western common places   what   a game can be very  japanese  and have any kind of setting or location.
@adamjenson9369  it s not the location  but the kind of content they make. best example i can think of is silent hill  which is inspired by the american film jacob s ladder. you can tell the game is japanese in its unique atmosphere  music and the delicate issues it addresses and yet the kind of story we see is quite  westernised . this charm was lost when the original team stopped developing the games.
@purefoldnz3070  you don t know what the term means
the japanese do not know how to portray a true knee that grows. they need to put them eating fried chicken  being disrespectful  sassy  stealing bikes and complaining about ray - cism  not trying to make them sound as cool as miles morales with god awful animation. now  if they had miles morales budget for this game  people would have no problem with this.
you might wanna tell this to a lot of the biggest japanese game franchises. they live and breathe off of  wannabe american   or more like western in general . take dmc for example or bayonetta or mgs  especially revengeance  and so on.a japanese studio or publisher can make whatever they want and be inspired by whatever culture. what matters is the quality of effort put in. square themselves have proven this numerous times and they ve been flopping recently with both traditional and experimental titles. you re trying to pin down a reason when all there is to it is that this game was a bad attempt.
i got into manga because of the sole reason of dc comics came out and said... if you dont like our politics  take you money elsewhere.  so i went to manga and then anime and i have never looked back. for me it wasnt about the culture of japan or their lifestyle but rather their entertainment.
@dkarkarov   you forgot to mention star ocean the divine force that just recently came out or just star ocean in general. i actually just got a ps4  bought star ocean integrity and faithfulness and enjoying the f ck out of it.
yes that s why i watch 95  of my anime subbed
very gen z
sounds like a tiktok instead of a video game
even 7yo can do better insults
cringe. what pronouns did she use for the boss
is gaslighting this year s favorite word  i ve never heard it before in my life as much as i did this year.
@uchihakuriso  yes .and no cap ..and based .i wish they would all go away lol
@ericwalker6477  based is a beautiful word
@guillermodominguezdelafuen2730  yea that s based
its crazy how the two western games they did that were actually good they ruined them  deus ex and sleeping dogs . they got united front shut down. also they never did anything significant with the legacy of kain series other than a godawful pc only first persona multiplayer shooter  and they canceled a single player game which actually looked promising . so yeah killing those ips  messing up tomb raider  messing up hitman  and dropping the ball on marvel s avengers hard. only gotg came out good somehow.and then of course there s their own japanese made failings  ff xv taking 10 yrs to make and being mid  left alive being a poor attempt at front mission  balan wonderland......nuff said  chocobo racing reboot being a gaas thats being shut down  and lastk....babylon s fall....or babylon s fail. so yeah this game is just another peg on their checklist of catching l slets hope ff xvi and ff remake part 2 are decent. jeez..
it also not helping signing a no xbox clause with sony when they are not in the position financially to sign exclusive deals and when there other games except final fantasy is failing.
accountable for making a stupid game.
ya we all saw that panel at the last e3   all that signaling - i m not touching this game.  this character looks completely annoying and matty said  the endless dialogue continues constantly throught the entire game.
doubt it. they still want to pursue nft s and microtransactional goods
don t hire woke californian writers for their game  just stick to their guns.
they rarely learn from their mistakes.
you never go full me  andromeda...
@silverhawkroman  sorry  my face is.... tired.
@mrmistah1588  don t forget their repeated failed attempts to release live-service games in a market that s currently overcrowded with them  whether for mainline machines or mobile. ff7 1st soldier shut down in just over a year. babylon s fall didn t even make a full year. avengers is about be shut down now. and i can t even recall how many mobiles games they ve released have been shut down by now.
didn t they just file for bankruptcy
gordon ... junior gorg!  awsome memory flashback there.
holy f...
lol  those words put together in that specific order sounds like a typical lib comment.
no freaking way!!!!! i refuse to believe this is real life
stop. are you serious
dam
@uchihakuriso  actually yes... webster s dictionary said it was the most searched word for 2022...
wasn t that the entire plot of strangers in paradise final fantasy
@guillermodominguezdelafuen2730  you re stuck in 2011.
the acting is worse than a safety training video  fr.
@batman0  the lead actress is the same girl you all remember from a certain charlie s angels that bomb at the box office yeah that is her i don t like the film it was given to me for free so you know this is very bad
@christopherloyd8938  lol ouch
i love jrpgs  but square enix dialogue for ff games have been kinda garbo for ahile.  ff15 lines for the most part are trash.
@christopherloyd8938 wasn t she in that awful and also canceled resident evil netflix show  or was it someone else
tbf  the game was developed by a western studio. but then again  this is also square enix  which is called the ea of japan for a good reason.
@samgoff5289  main character
@raymkkkk  i agree. i loved the ff7 remake but a lot of the dialogue was super corny and borderline cringe. maybe i m too old
this was one of those  hold my beer  moments lol
all i s on me
way to make your main character an insufferable narcissist. good job se.
feels like writers here were trying to mimic neir with the wise talking book weiss arguing and conversing with kaine but failing miserably. yoko taro actually knows how to write.
these are lines the player should be saying  not the character.
@edmontonboy1619 goooood one
@shaikanwolf8  did they want to make her character narcissistic like who she played on that terrible netflix resident evil show that got cancelled lol
@shaikanwolf8  basically just poc aloy   gen z edition.
@palidor  yeah can t stand alloy either.
@edmontonboy1619  w comment
it is her  truth
thought it was the only clever bit of writing in the whole game
@edmontonboy1619
i mean bioware games had political themes in them too
@dream6562  the difference was that those themes were implemented with the story and characters in mind
well  supposedly  this game doesn t have that crap  but people aren t buying it. hogwarts and the last of us part 2 have that crap  but people rushed out to buy those games. people refuse to vote with their wallets and then continue to complain about how the problem hasn t gotten better. you are the problem!
@jay_sullivan  i voted with my wallet on those two games. i saw the tlou2 leaks and did not buy the game at all. hogwash legacy i am not buying because it s the only thing more gay than the last of us. and i m using the word gay mid 2000 s style.
@michaelbush1374    i respect that.
i get the  vote with your wallet  idea  and at least at the box office we seem to be seeing this have some real effect. contrast   top gun  maverick  with that all gay bromance movie that came out or the olivia wilde film that was nothing more than a hit piece against jordan peterson. the difference being that gaming is a cultural space that lends itself to a demographic of people that tend to be younger and less apt to be traditionally outgoing in socialization. this is one of the demographics primarily targeted by the indoctrination efforts of the woke religion. thankfully  with the cultural space of gaming becoming more main stream with each generation  we are seeing more ideological  social and spiritual diversity entering the space  including those that understand and recognize dangerous and destructive cult behavior and propaganda  and are willing to shine the light of truth upon it. for my own part  i have been a huge borderlands fan for the last decade or so  but i just could not bring myself to buy  tiny tina s wonderlands  because of how hard it leaned into the woke propaganda. i am so sick of being proselytized to when i am trying to escape reality.
gatekeeping was necessary and we let a bunch of bad actors into our fandoms.  they re working on tabletop next  i fear what happens to warhammer when it becomes the next  thing .
what s exactly political about forspoken  do they talk about gun control or immigration policy
@fercpolo  don t you need imagination for those....
that s what i was looking at too
@c4caffeen134  i m always looking at her face mmmmm
those big almond eyes tell no lies
i need to play the demo if it s still up.  heartbreak is painful.  but  it must be done before we can move on.i was hyped for this game  too.  gameplay should be most important.  but still  if you can t bare some aspect of a game  then it can really drag it down.  the release state of some games in the last 5 years  for example  i ve had to put down until they patched the gameplay.  that would be crazy if they tried an experiment and patched the entire writing  story  dialogue and voice acting.   lol
as soon as  fuck  popped its ugly head up  i knew this was going to be cringe. what is up with  writers  these days depending so heavily on cursing every 8 seconds. even in ragnarok there was an unnecessary amount of it. personally it should be reserved for really big uh oh or revelation type moments.
@j.d.  then stick to kids games sorry
@mrjaces  what s fucked is the dialogue of a woke mob lol
all i had to do was look at the  protagonist  lmao....woke flop guaranteed
i was amped for this game as well. sadly i refuse to give this company my money. why sad  because square enix has done some awesome games in the past.
@paladinminipedro707  hence why i wait for yt gamers to review games
well  that escalated quickly  lmfaoo hahahaha !
how so  whom would she have offended if she reacted more to your liking  you are being absurd. she was geeking out a bit because she just found out that she can perform some type of magic. i truly don t see the issue  and none of you are articulating it. what would the character have said or done if you made the scene
@jay_sullivan  show don t tell. show don t tell. show. don t. tell. this is writing 101 and what people are complaining about. there s no good way to have your character blabber about how cool they think their new powers are  my friend of questionable taste. lmfao.
@hyperion3641  comes off as a kindergarten cartoon... but i guess that s their focus these days  people with kindergarten  maturity ....
@jay_sullivan  i m all for trashing this game but the first clip i didn t find particularly bad.there s other clips which do show worst scenes but it s biggest failures are technical
@factshurtu    i don t speak as she does  but i have seen plenty of people who do speak that way  and i don t find them especially annoying. i haven t seen much of the game  but this is being shown as a highlight of how bad it gets. it s not a strong case.
@jay_sullivan  then it s the game for you. some urban shaniqua with magic and an englishman in her head is already tiresome and ive only seen one convo.
possibility    that s actually what is happening  people are being hired specifically for their race and gender to fit esg scores.
don t forget  with lots and lots of profanity
this is why se should stay in japan only
i can t get over the gap in her teeth. that s so distracting.
who the hell talks like that....even if someone handed me a script i would be like ok wtf is this i don t tak like this  nobody does let s fix this
i want to watch some walkthroughs just to see the  takes from the players lol
reminds me of a crappy disney show
@shaikanwolf8    omg  the teeth gap
i liked lightning and cloud from ff because they didn t talk a lot and sound like attention seeking valley girls  now we got this!
that s one terrible movie.
i thought it was because they went way over budget for the cgi.........
merging with enix ends squaresoft golden era.
@caliginousmoira8565  that too  as well as their all-star cast  ming na-wen  alec baldwin  steve buscemi  james woods  peri gilpin
i think the good thing about the initial teaser was that she never talked.
that is part of it but you can see from the trailer that the face is much closer to the models. the in game one does some weird stuff with her mouth making it look like someone else  at best an ugly cousin.    a cynic might wonder why they would make a beautiful woman look so rough.
@monkian  you re not wrong. from my memory of the still that mel showed the textures and shaders would play a big role in that  looked a lot like my first year game dev character before i learned how to use normals  spec and gloss maps haha.
should ve changed it to   her story ends    lmao!
everyone knew it was gonna be awful! a waste of some impressive world streaming technology unfortunately!
b a c k p e d d l i n g
mine in the uk is  find your fight  lol
this game requires 4080 for pc to play on 4k 60 ... it is a poorly optimized game and these scenery do not require that graphic. it will run when optimized properly on 2060 at least. my game prototype with similar graphical level in pre alpha runs at smooth 70 in editor mode and 120 in standalone game mode on ue5 with rtx 2060 super.
same. looks ok from trailer so i tried the demo. lasted 20 mins then uninstalled it. yuk!
i m so glad demos are still a thing  unfortunately we don t get the luxury of getting them for every aaa title  but at least it s not a dead concept.
actual game is better than the demp  but it is still kind of meh
had the chance to see it on console it looked very blurry at times like low resolution
i refuse to believe that forspoken was done by the  japanese division of  square i mean this game has so many  check boxes  it had to be done by the american division i guess  fingers crossed if ff16 will be any good great job has always  melanie much love from the uk
that 5 second clip just saved me a lot of money  these writers should call geico.
sanford and son was one of the most popular shows across all demographic lines in the 1970s. the tv audience back then did not care at all that all of the characters were black. you couldn t make that show today. they would have to bombard the audience with  messages  and no one would sit through it. let s go back to the 1970s and start again from there.
what needles my ample  cherubic pink buttocks about this whole thing is that writing a humorously detached character is real easy when you get down to it  going out of the way to make one that is just kind of loathsome with it seems like going an extra mile in the wrong direction. it d be cooler for the approach to be excited  but also real cautious  like i actually do have supernatural abilities now  how do i keep from accidentally blowing off my own leg or turning some poor  thankful orphan into a giant foot by accident. go absurd  but relatable.
the dialogue makes the original resident evil look like shakespeare.
feels like the same writers that brought us willow
forspoken is a great example of why silent protagonists in jrpg s are awesome.
thank you  ms. melonie! where are these writers coming from     can t go to the movies  can t watch a play  can t see a commercial  and now can t play a game without this  crappy stuff .  this stuff has gotten ridiculous and is oozing everywhere in so-called entertainment.
just when you thought dialog couldn t be worse than the show velma they totally redeem themselves
ya  i ll just wait for hogwarts legacy. thanks for the heads-up melonie.
always great to start the week off with a new video! hope you have a fantastic day  melonie. can t wait for the next fire emblem stream.and congrats on 110k. love to see your channel growing.
the main writer  todd stashwick  is a tv bit actor who has played in over 130 shows  which may explain some of the oddball dialogue  especially if you watch his recent appearance in the dungeon run s  tiger by the tail  as drooth vandalyx  https   youtu.be pvul4pffkzm t 157 .it s curious that before he even appeared on that episode of tdr  he had never even heard of dungeons and dragons  before his appearance  he thought it was a video game .
this trend in modern western gaming has been highly detrimental. as soon as i saw the launch trailers  i knew exactly what the final product was going to be. once we see  dei  attributes deployed in a game  we know what s going to happen. and as soon as player see dei in the game  we ve been conditioned to simply walk away. a decade ago   nobody cared in the slightest. now  its met with a groan.
your reaction to hearing the dialogue is so great. amazing video  hope you ve been having a great day!
compare this to the banter between master chief and cortana when she first was inserted into his suit and therefore head  she made the snarky comment of master chief s head having  lots of space   to which he reacted with punching his helmet   shaking  her up. soon they found their groove  master chief started to appreciate what cortana added to his capabilities and cortana appreciated what master chief could do and that he was an honourable man. i miss having the competent writers and creators from those days.
yeah  so  i never felt like the reboot lara needed anyone to feel sorry for her or want to save her.  i felt like she started the first game as a more-or-less normal person tossed into a nightmare situation and we get to go along this journey of awakening with her  where she learns to become the badass action-adventure woman by the end.  the first game is actually very similar to oliver queen s transformation into the arrow.  i didn t care for the second game  but the third one comes back with an obsessed and overconfident lara who puts her friends in danger and starts the apocalypse.  this original trilogy has all been about her growth as a character  to me  and what the journey was to make her more like the original lara who is done with causes and just wants to enjoy life again. i have heard the developer interviews  at least some of them  and if they were trying to make lara feel helpless and damnseled  they failed as far as i m concerned.
this dialogue sounds as if the cw decided to make a game.
i just moved sh t with my mind said it 14x. man  mike tyson should teach these writers how to write good humor dialogue before kicking ass. he s an expert with that.
i always had the impression that forspoken was never supposed to be a game  just a visual representation of what unreal 5 could do.
played the demo once i got my ps5  loved the gameplay and really enjoyed the upgrades and flow of combat. didn t pay much attention to the dialog but there were some cringe and annoying moments that i can recall.
forespoken is a re-purpose agni s philosophy in the name of  equity .
it wasn t. this is from the western division studio within square and it shows  -
there hasn t been a good final fantasy game since 12
@superabound2  i hate to agree with you on that  ff7 ie good butnits a reamake so it dosent count
@superabound2  xv is an incomplete masterpiece still. way more ff than xiii in terms of world building.
@superabound2   interesting i think ff peaked after 10
they had already gave the woke mob the finger when they were complaining about the all white cast in ff16. so hopes they keep that conviction up. i already pre-ordered my copy because of that.
amy hennig was involved with this game. looks like they ruined her concept. she was involved in the conceptual stage.
was barrett  of ff7  a  checkbox   you people are desperately looking for something to hate  but there are already plenty of things available to fill that role.
@jay_sullivan  everyone likes barret. so nope!
i m comin   elizabeth!
agreed. as much as this game is flopping  i appreciate forspoken is following what you just described  as race is inconsequential to the story and evidently is never even brought up.

square enix aren t the developers. luminous productions are the developers. same team that made ff15
@jay_sullivan  why do you assume checkboxes meant race   when literally no one is talking about that. seems like you re the one reaching.
.. if you think wokeness is american in origin then you are likely to change your mind in the coming months. wokeness is esg scores and such which come from places decidedly not american in their mindsets.
@shaikanwolf8    i m sure you ll be kind enough to tell me which boxes are being checked that makes this game bad.
@jay_sullivan  barret is a good character. put the cope down and accept this game s writing is shit.
the japanese improve it so they are responsible
the game was developed by japanese...but the story was made by americans writers  gary whitta  rogue one  a star wars story   amy hennig  uncharted series   allison rymer  and todd stashwick.
@jay_sullivan  the insufferable zoomer dialogue alone makes this game bad among other thingsbarret wasn t made for woke points there s nothing about racism in his story he s just a character who happens to be black
@jay_sullivan  don t make annoying characters and i won t hate them then lmao.
@jay_sullivan  no  considering barret was created when the woke crowd hadn t invaded everything yet.
ffxvi or ff16 won t have woke crap in it. it s solely based and inspired by medieval culture of europe.
@shaikanwolf8  yeah melonie spoke about that the entitlement to dictate on developers what race of characters they should include  and how their games should look like. i m so happy yoshi p gave them the finger.
@shaikanwolf8  you should buy dozens of copies of ff16! because this what we want games staying faithful to the setting and the white race of characters! i love the all white cast of ff16!
@timmytimmymit5607  that s nice to hear  one shining spot at square still left eh
@timmytimmymit5607  i wish i could  but i m tight on money at the moment. if i did have the money i would surely buy lots of copies and give them out. we really need to support game developers who don t bend the knee to these psychos.
@mrmistah1588  luminous studio is part of se just so you know.
@user-oq3zd7sy5j   ...there s nothing about racism in his story  to be fair  your statement about barret also applies to frey here. woke people are actually complaining that gender and race are literally not brought up at all and  inconsequential  in this game. one of the review articles melanie shows they state this. so in this case  she s also just a character who happens to be black like barret.
it makes the dialogue in the dmc reboot seem like shakespeare.
that s funny and f    up to you know this game is going to flop and speaking of resident evil imma go play that part 5 that has a native american indian woman  don t have terrible dialogue
it makes the original house of the dead  dialogue seem like shakespeare
what you talking about  original resident evil writing was gold
stop! don t open.... that door!
she was gonna be a jill sandwich
yesss i m so stoked!  d
@meloniemacgoboom  one of my favourite female fantasy characters is tika from the original  dragonlance chronicles trilogy. she start out  more or less  a regular girl working as a waitress  and develops into a kick ass warrior.
@meloniemacgoboom  i was playing some while waiting for the stream. i m so far behind you lol
@meloniemacgoboom  the took amy hennigs concept for this games world a destroyed it.
how can you be alive and say you ve never heard of d d   that s like saying you ve never heard of football  lol
the dialogue for the game is about as corny as his dialogue from drooth in the show mentioned above  so no surprise there. he sounds like someone who probably would love strangers of paradise  but most likely loathes  or has never heard of  final fantasy xiv.
my favorite was at the end of halo ce where they had to go inside the pillar of autumn and he crashed the banchee getting in and cortana said  you did that on purpose didn t you   lol
it s a perverted demo of agni s philosophy. but they wanted to make a woke game. why are japanese tapping into the woke community  what are they trying to accomplish.
@timmytimmymit5607  money
i mean  to be fair  just cause games were friggin  dope. deus ex  also dope. countless hours of my life wasted  i use that term loosely .but...yeah  this dialogue is absolute dog water  wtf. thanks for posting this  i m glad i watched your review. i was stoked for this. not so much anymore. limiting reviews never spells confidence.
this game needed at least another five years and an extra two for optimization
hey melonie! you look incredible. i know a lot of people have been giving you shade online over your post. they just don t get your sense humor or understand your point about cute tomboy characters looking fit without looking manly. you make great and fun  and funny too  videos. you re pretty darn cool in my book. looking forward to the next live stream. take care and have a wonderful day melonie.
forspoken is glorious and i m loving every second. fray is a new fav oc for me. this is not a joke or satire  i m 100 percent serious.
the intro game dialogue sounded like instructions for what they want you to think. like listen to dialogue! assimilate! this is how you feel!
my hopes right now are on stellar blade. thank god it s not being made by a western studio.
just want to point out quickly how much i m enjoying all of these daily uploads. its almost become part of my routine now
the irony the writers room probably looks diverse in appearance  but the minds  thoughts  and life experience of the people in those rooms are as homogenous as can be.  all of the characters in these kinds of shows  movies  and games sound and act and joke in exactly the same way.  real life isn t like that outside of their isolated bubble.
this game is a re-purpose agni s philosophy in the name of  equity . esg squenix in a nutshell.
woohoo lets make a game with a mc who just tells everyone to f off and hates pretty much everything
am i the only one who thinks of the dialogue from disney s moana  that s what the character from forspoken reminds me of. that little moment that moana has before she smacks herself in the head with the oar.
this is why the hitman developers left square.
this is why i root for silent protagonists.
i feel bad for ella  she s been getting bad scripts  re netflix series and now this.
what s crazy to me is the talent behind this and it s this
the  did i just do that  scene felt like somebody talking to a brick wall or like an ai wrote it  started getting tidus vibes with how awkward that scene was.
from a couple videos of people i ve seen post on here  one them picked the lowest graphics setting to get 90fps and her model looks like in the video here while another i saw her model looked a lot better but didn t show what settings they picked. will be interesting to see how the graphics look on pcs considering the crazy requirements that were posted for it. game just getting attacked from both sides for different reasons.
i hate when companies seem to spend more time and effort on reveal trailers and totally flub on the finished product. i kind of felt this with biomutant. it seemed like more time and effort went into the reveal trailer than the actual project.
makes me appreciate the stoic  silent protagonists of old.
i know a few people who majored in gender studies and i don t think even they could come up with writing this bad if they tried. i m at the point where i think this is deliberate. i don t know why  it just seems that way  it s impossible for me to believe the people involved with this game were going over these cutscenes  reading the script and thought  yeah  this is fantastic.  there is simply no way.
just cause 4 wasn t the best. it s a lot better now. but it s still like a 7 out of 10 after all its patches.
this game needed an abortion. and i m pro life  so that means a lot coming from me.
wow  king simp has shown himself
@cyrusthegreat3299  it s probably her stalker
@megakazuya123  i think so. this super nice guys are creepy af.
@cyrusthegreat3299 every damn video
@josephking3837  seriously
hey man and you.. dont you worry if ppl call you a simp or creepy or anything like that. they just dont get that youre prob just a big  ol lovey dovey teddy bear. sorry bruh i couldnt resist...ffs.
@cyrusthegreat3299  ive gotten 2rd hand embarrassment from reading that
@fightlikabrave  exactly.and all his comments are like that.for every damn video.like  wtffff!he said  thank u  my friend holyyyyyy shitt. that s next level desperate.
@cyrusthegreat3299  wow lol
@cyrusthegreat3299  would you rather have a mean guy who treats you terribly
@cyrusthegreat3299  but it paid off  she liked his comment! our gentleman is getting some action.
@palidor  you re definition of  action  is different from mine  bro.
@lenarmangum8630  i would have people be normal.
reminds me of jill valentine in re3 remake. potty mouth that hates everyone. it s why i call her karen valentine
sometimes i want them to talk  but the grunts is most of the time enough...
dark souls and elden ring!
contact me for your reward
the facial animation reminds me of what mass effect  andromeda looked like when it was first released. before they went back in after the outcry and tried to make things better.
squaresoft. we miss you. the enix part phucked it all up for us 90s early 2000s gamers.
this is the r rated version of what my sister would say and act like after watching hanna montana and the suite life of zack and cody.  the protagonist talks like a disney channel character
the technical issues are what bothers me the most. even if it wasn t for all the bad dialogue  the game is still poorly optimised. i don t even know what i expect from square enix at this point.
i m just playing nier replicant  and to imagine the kid bickering at this level with weiss would piss me off
i actually really enjoyed this game quite a bit every thing on it i thought was really well done for me at least
square enix is on life support  and final fantasy is the only thing keeping it alive.
i really liked the character that they had introduced  back then when i saw the announcement  and was looking forward to this game. but all i needed was to hear some of that crappy dialogue to make me concerned. so i spent a good amount of time playing the demo and i gotta say i have very mixed feelings about it  leaning more towards negative ...funny enough just like a lot of other people who tried it. i don t think i want to get this get anymore or at least not now  maybe when the price drops by 50-65  then maybe. and if everybody s sale predictions are anything to go by  it might not take that long. shame  such a wasted opportunity. literally everyone could have got their piece of cake here.
that s some top tier marvel comedy right there  recently even the shazam 2 trailer had a similar dialogue.
i remember this game was getting roasted earlier this year for the same reason. months later still cringe inducing  still making me swear not to play or watch anyone else play it.
i agree and i m mixed and when i play a game i m not bothered by the race cause i play them cause of the story  gameplay  characters  but i cancelled my preorder for other reasons this game  did deliver some much hype and promised great things would come from its release but sadly led to a disappointment and hope it gets better down the road.
i played  the demo she seems boring at the start but wants you do free roam she is awesome but in other areas it felt like she just don t want to be there i mean that s the whole point i m getting at is she s the type to start something than don t want to keep going at it like the day after. like how people say their new years resolution.  also like how every bad thing she does she gets away with it cause she knows the judge who is filing the case for her to see if she goes to jail or not. no you won t get copy right from pure game play its the stupid music that you do. also its sad that some games on the ps5 looks like i m playing on ps4 or ps3  little bit of 2 specially after the marvel midnight suns.
i didnt realize how pretty the model was  i thought she was a generated character  not based off of someone...they didnt do her justice...
se can continue to get away with these mistakes.  their flagship titles make so much for them that they can take risks that are advised against without much worry.  their ceo seems to have an obsession with doing that  even going against yoshi-p on certain things.
dang when i played the demo it didn t seem that bad   that s a shame
from the trailers i never had high hopes for plot or dialogue all i was interested in from the start was the gameplay reallyi m a sucker for good story but i do have a couple games with shitty story or characters that i like to play just for the gameplay usually play them with my own loud music in the background and i don t miss anything important anyway xdthe talking cuff  sounds like someone to sympathise with at least
well apart from the dialogue  the game is fun  it s infamous meets elden ring. the world is filled with a lot of bosses to fight. enjoying it
who wrote this shit  - everyone not woke
i fear hearing such dialogue in the next tomb raider game
had a long hard day  so i just want to say something positive  melanie your hair looks great
my face is tired!
enix was good though...at least through star ocean
yaa  enix just published it. mean while tri ace actually developed it. star ocean that is  if we re talking originally.
@zerosyks9255  yeah but during that time the games were good. after square fused with them they soured. weird.it s almost like square said they would allow one decent game  till the end of time  then butcher the rest because final fantasy is their baby.square has made some decent stuff after the fusion  it s not because they fused with enix is what i m getting at lol
well hopefully it s just a coincidence. also i think there is a mess of games beside just final fantasy  which in my opinion has been on the decline since around ff9  saga frontier use to be good  then they changed it  screwed it all up. parasite eve used to be good  then they changed it. xenogears used to be good  then they changed it. idk feels like more then a coincidence to me.
i agree  had they stayed squaresoft i think everything would have gone in a better direction. was what i was saying. lol  sry if i came off side ways
it s kid-com level writing without the sex  drugs  and profanity filter. there s no charm from the actor or actress to leverage here  either. with that comes terribly unsubtle acting and painfully on-the-nose dialogue from characters you have to hope even have a second dimension to them.
she even reminds me of a tv-ma version of alex russo from wizards of waverly place  which was on around the same time as those other shows  with her biting  mean-spirited snark. again  this lady lacks the charm and softer moments presented over there to balance her out and make her more likable.
ella  balinska she was in the 2019 charlie s angels film and netflix s resident evil series
@kennethstephens3806  not really the best career choices
their ceo wants to invest in nft!
@timmytimmymit5607  i know  thankfully the board and yoshi-p were able to stop him from putting it in certain games
exactly
if that happened no one is buying that game do you hear me right now probably ship and assholes they are going to buy not me i bought the last two i ll go back to play tr underworld that s better
remember the tomb raider game where the first bad guy you kill doesn t even know you re there  you just sneak up to him and kill him without any justification  and then you had like 2 hours of puzzles and tomb raiding.
i agree the dialog was bad but could it be also lack of direction or the actress lack of experience as a va  also the quality is a bit concerned could it be a watchdog cyberpunk situation
i to this day still can t wrap my head around your issue with survivor era tomb raider. she started off as this scared girl and grew into this badass warrior. you ve seen her grow and develop throughout the trilogy. there s nothing wrong with her character or the story at all. and in regards to forspoken  i honestly like the game. it s not great but it s not god awful either. it s decent.
if square can finally wake up and fire their marketing department then this will be great for the company.
totally agree especially most reviewers didn t get review codes   the pc port is like they didn t see the specs like for ultra graphics we need a rtx 4080 wtf   square enix is also confident it s gonna fail that s why they didn t provide so many reviewer s especially for pc review codes so please don t buy it before seeing reviews.
shame. i really want this game to be good. i get a never-ending story vibe from it for some reason. i also like the color-coded magic  with runed-out fingernails and capes.guess i ll keep on with the witcher 3 next-gen upgrade until hogwarts legacy.
i just want to tell you that congrats to you on your 110k subs on your boom channel. also i am so happy for you melonie. anyway also i just wanted to make a comment on this topic of video that forspoken video game is going to be awful and terrible video game that no one will be wanting to buy it to play the game and i think that they should never have started making this video game and left it and start making some other video games to sell out to the video game companies to sell it out to the costumer who wants to play some other video games instead of forspoken video game  ok melonie. anyway i just want to make a comment about this topic of this video and i just wanted to tell you that congrats to you on your 110k subs for your boom channel  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today   hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have fun with continuing to play the fire emblem engage video game and have a good nite too melonie.
watched my first review of this game yesterday  and you are the second person to say that the writing is bad.  i might eventually check it out if there is a deep discount  but i may mute it and just read the lore handouts in the game. my thought is that gaming companies are actually hiring people that are good at creating visual arts only  and then expecting only a few people who have been with their company for a while to do the writing  or are having people who aren t normally game writers do the writing. why do i think this  i just applied for a production internship with wizards of the coast. their linkedin description says are looking for people who know how to use photoshop and create edit videos. there was no mention of writing  editing or proofreading skills  even though i m interested in dungeons and dragons  and they print  produce a lot of campaign books in which writers describe worlds  game mechanics  monsters  npcs  etc.
been looking into in-depth breakdowns of this game  from it s debut reveal to present day. an expensively slapped together game with story and mechanics held in place with scotch tape  -is how i would put it.someone at square enix really screwed the pooch on this one.
the fact that amy hennig  worked on this makes me sad and baffled how it turned out like this
i hope it s woke so we all can call it forwoken.
glad i resisted the urge to pre-order! i ve seen a lot of footage today  and a lot of these characters look super stiff and made of plastic. one of the complaints that really gets me though  is how little character development there is over the course of the story. hopefully it shows up ps  so we don t have to pay for it.
i sent them a message via email a while back. after seeing the travesty of outriders  i told them not to follow western game companies and their soulless political garbage. i told them to embrace their history of making wonderful japanese games  that their culture was unique and it was the western world that should change not them.  they not only never messaged me back  but they started sending me advertisements.
i really wanted to buy it but with the low storages of the ps5 it was hard. but maybe i ll buy the game when it goes on sale
i m not a gamer but i do like melonie mac s content  great sense of humour with intelligence and decency. first saw this lady on fnt. plus the natural beauty is gorgeous. and ryan hates how melonie s frozen camera shot still looks great... cheer s
i find it annoying how if they use a rl model for a character they not only don t give a bit of artistic fancying up like to better fit the scenario or setting and jsut fit the graphic typing but they often make the character uglier then the rl model and then claim the reason they made the character uglier  is they were making it more realistic and its specifically female characters they do that  to think its just wide spread venustraphobia i believe the term of phobia of attractive woman
i m black i just want to play games. i don t care about color just great games.
i think it is super hard to come up with a really good idea for a game. let alone writing good characters.
the only thing i m worried about with forspoken is the voice acting and script. the rest looks interesting.
what is happening is the result of validating and praising everything. i see it in art  i see it in media where no matter how bad something is constructive criticism towards it is considered hate speech. p.s. i m a gen z and i hate what the industry is becoming. they need to take several seats right now.
it is woke forwoken
maybe get dead space instead. or wanted dead.
let us pray for the dead space remake
@dusterdimmu81  the original was fantastic!
are you going to make a vid on bruce straley not being credited in hbo s the last of us  he was the co-creator for the last of us and directed the first game. he was pivotal in why the first game was as good as it was and he is not happy he was not credited in the tv show.
the root of woke politics and virtue signaling is narcissism. when you look at it for what it is it reflects and exposes the narcissism of the person doing it. games have become one long scolding lecture and targeted guilt trip for the gamers. that s the biggest reason why these games tank. it s not our fault that the out of touch developers just don t get it.
the dialogue error in this game is cultural in this modern era.
it has woke vibes to me. highly doubt it s something i d enjoy and i m a huge rpg fan.
the face scan of the mc was so bad that it didn t even register in my mind that she was the same person from charlie s angels. it s the video game equivalent of a bad portrait tattoo.
now i know where the batgirl writers went after the show was canceled!
as one who loved games like infamous prototype and even sunset overdrive.i would love such a game like this normally with it s open sandboxworld gameplay and super power.i feel so bad for the actress but she works with what she got.but the writing of this game is very lacking beside gameplay issues infamous second son had a character that was this teen young adult throwing out one-liners and such but it worked there because one cared for the story and character.it s a crime that second son never got a sequel or another infamous came after it.
so this is what those fired twitter employees were working on at their new job.
the funny bit is they took a paycheck from sony to not release on xbox for a year and now no one on xbox is going to buy it at all. a flop on one platform is way way worst than flip on all platforms.
i played the demo and it seemed kind of .janky. that s the best way i can describe it.
honestly i am nearly 100  sure the game never had a quality test what so ever... i mean that the writers did a terrible job but the big question the producer or the quality team  when there even was one  had to approve this verbal abomination. just imagine writing this dialogue and you look at this and saying   i am good xddd
this is on par with  they fly now  they fly now!
you explained the situation perfectly!
you looked absolutely beautiful this video.on topic  square enix is pretty much free to take these kinds of risks because final fantasies  dragon  insert title here  and semi-experimental rpgs like romancing saga. one would hope most people do not buy a videogame that has this kind of approach  but... we are living in 2023... sigh
oh man  i like the isekai theme going on. hope it doesn t flop
that sounded like an actor doing their first couple attempts of trying to imitate keanu reeves  attempt at figuring out the voice for ted
they should get these guys to make a she-hulk game
i remember seeing standups like 10  years ago using the  i do that now  line. i believe louis c.k. had a bit about getting old and used it. how long do these writers think a joke holds up
funny how squaresoft in the 90s was almost bulletproof and you know if you saw that logo  you were going to get a quality game. nowadays it seems like it s almost the exact opposite. ign gave this a surprisingly decent review and ended up giving it a 6. i would put this firmly in the  25 or less category.
i appreciate melanie for her take on this game. speaking for myself  i am tired of the virtue signaling. just make good games!
they ve published many terrible games before.remember balan s wonderworld  yep. square enix published that failure of a game
this is already a re-purpose agni s philosophy in the name of  equity . that alone is a red flag.
twerking intensify
bring it you mangled monsters!  that was so cringe. why can t people write good dialogue anymore!
funny enough im pretty sure fire emblem engage is absolutely crushing forespoken on it s launch day. which i m excited about. fire emblem is an excellent jrpg series and more sales means more fire emblem games
squeenix know this is a turkey - between the poor optimization  the awful dialogue and the lack of review codes  they re sending it out to die.
2 things will happen in a melonie vid  she will mention lara croft and she will be unable to decide if she wants to put her sweater on all the way or not
i wish they would make a sequel to the bouncer.
the codes weren t limited by reviewer  but by platform. all the codes that went out were for ps5. if you requested a code for pc you heard nothing back at all.
that s what happens when greedy companies take that esg money.
this game had so much potential. colin called out the dialogue months ago... so bad
so far  i m enjoying the game!
i feel like this game will go on discount faster than tomb raider 2013 and it will be on sale in about 1-2 months cuz from what i ve seen from all of the reactions people are more than likely not gonna buy the game day 1 and either wait for it to go on discount or wait until there are preowned copies of it.
he literally wants the character to be less relatable for most of the audience.
maybe they knew the dialogue was bad  so they didn t show it. first time i ve seen dialogue from this game.
oh  they ve given up on the western audience specially when they sold crystal dynamics  and the other studios
dude  forspoken was the  1 game i was looking forward to since the ps5 was revealed. this makes me angry lol
love your channel spitting truth god bless!! this game is straight cringe
i m going to check how the japanese version is like cause well the original game designer for this game is from the asia part of square enix. yes game trailers are really lying to us to the point why game trailers actually look better than the actual game it self these days.
from what i ve been hearing  it doesn t get any better. i d be fine with the initial dialogue if the character went through growth and changed as a person as it goes on  but it appears that this is not the case. an unfortunate pass for me which is saddening since this did look genuinely interesting at announcement.
haha they were trying to cater to the work ones  can t.
the looks of the main character already say  the game is going to be terrible .
for a current gen only game the graphics are not quite as polished or impressive as i was hoping. a plague tale innocence - a last gen game from 2019 set in medieval europe during the black death - has far better graphical fidelity than this game does. bare in mind that that game was from a smaller developer in france too  which makes square enix look bad. maybe it was the old game engine they used perhaps
idk  i think the best writers just aren t put in the limelight. personally  i don t think the  i can move shit with my freakin  mind  part was that bad  given that there are plenty of characters  especially comic book characters  that basically had the same type of reaction dialogue when discovering their powers. i don t think it was bad  just average. the mangled monster bit was hot garbage though  i m not even gonna lie. it was terrible  i completely agree. but the whole  move shit with mind  shitck is something alot of characters have done alot in fiction  especially teen superheroes. i don t think it s  good  but then again i m exactly sure what reaction they expect her to have. maybe i m missing something  it s just average to me
bad dialogue writing is like the mumble rap of video games these days. same with movies.
whoever wrote that doesn t know the meaning of the word  mangled .
yeah turning a promising tech demo called agni s philosophy becomes a crt ff called forespoken.
i think forspoken is getting the domino affect. a lot of people were angry when the codes weren t released early. reviewers were already ready to kill this game upon arrival. i played ragnarok. i think that game was boring. i literally almost went to sleep on that game and stopped playing. forspoken to me isn t a bad game. it s not perfect or goty  but it s decent.
and they ll probably sell luminous productions too if this game flops
i remember years ago i was playing a bunch of action games where the main character is a girl. it was cool enjoyable granted the times were different. anyone remember wet  bullet which or velvet assassin
as to quote harrison ford   you can type this shit but you sure as hell can t say it.
melonie is the bomb  which explains the boom
joss whedon called. he said you can keep his 90s dialog.
i think the issue with the graphics  or in this case the face scans  is due to the game engine.  capcom and square both have their own game engines.   re engine that capcom has is way better when it comes to faces  its been out longer and they have made several games using that engine now.   se s luminous engine isn t new per say but it has only been used in 2 games.  and forespoken is one of them.   with that all said... i m still not getting it.   70 is a huge price tag for a game thats only like 30 hours.   i ll wait till it comes at least 50  off on steam  gmg  or humble.   but its a se game so that will likely never happen and if it does.. it will in 5 years.
i d pick hogwarts legacy over this game anyday
i don t even mind the energetic protagonist and analytical companion trope  i can see some good banter and character development brewing between such a dynamic.but she s just soooo annoying. constantly ignoring the bracelet  making it all about herself while the mcguffin clearly gave her the powers  all the while cursing up a storm and suddenly monsters don t faze her anymore from combat 2 onwards.
she can t give her cat good food while has a massive bag of cash on the floor. gives her cat away cos has no money even tho could of easly grabbed the money  too lol
i think writers are slowly becoming the become who do fanfiction  and people who are part of cancel culture
look they are going to keep doing this and it s going to keep being annoying. it s on us to ignore them  create our own products and gatekeep  when they don t like it remind them the product wasn t made for them
it sounds like r rated cw dialog.
i m still keeping my eyes on dontnod s new game. banishers  ghosts of new eden. though i would love another remember me!
i don t see a problem with the writing. i hate when they use dialogue like that in a period piece  but i don t see an issue with it for a current-day character. that seemed believable  unlike the voice acting and facial animations. the va wasn t bad. tlou2 has far worse dialogue  but people throw money at that. i wish people were rational.from the small amount i saw  the game looks like a 7 10 if you turn the quip frequency down to  low.  it would be worth  40.
i could write better dialogue for that type of scene in my sleep.and them not giving out review codes is not a good thing. they re trying to mine the first week sales before the player reviews start coming out as well as the yt videos.
the desire to watch anime in the jungle with a sleeping lion is just a weeb away a weeb away a weeb away.
they gave her the max payne1 goldeneye  treatment instead of the guardians of the galaxy treatment
americans are weebs.  awesome quote. lol!
it s like they managed to try entirely too hard while also not at all trying enough. i mean...it s almost impressive  i agree  the actress is absolutely gorgeous. how they managed to make her look this lifeless is mind boggling. and i m sure she s doing the best as is humanly possible with that dialogue  but it s so awful. she could be the best actor to gave ever existed and she wouldn t be able to save it i thought maybe it was just me thinking this  because i m an  old lady   41  and all these young whipper snapper  teeny boppers sound wacky to me! nope. it seems people of all ages feel this way about this game. maybe it can unite the world. all races  ages  backgrounds  etc  can find unity and brotherhood by realizing we all see its awfulness. just like  velma
i want the game but hope it comes with a option to change to japanese dialog.
i feel like this is what the cw would make if they made a video game
i was excited  but then once the trailers dropped  i got worried. then i played the deno and swore off the game
a lot of people expected this.
the cgi is  so advanced  yet the facial animations are looking pretty lobotomized
i think i can see what they trying were do with her character  but the joke ran on way too long. with characters like that less is more. they can be confused and excited but they shouldn t have them talking an essay to express that. that conversation should have been only a few lines.merrill from dragon age 2 is a character with a very similar personality and those writers did it a lot better. she s very open about her excitement and it doesn t become annoying or cringe. since they keep her lines to the minimum needed to express her feelings the dialogue never runs to long and the  joke  doesn t get old.
why s the characters  hair suddenly so stiff  during gameplay at least in the demo it flowed in the air as you moved or as the breeze blew. wtf   also i wonder if she s reacting this way due to her age   idk but i m there for the gameplay mainly  hopefully the dialog won t be bad enough to totally pull me out of the experience. great content melanie!!also yes  as a gamer i don t always want to be reminded of the racial issues and even gender issues that people go through in  every  single game with a modern setting. male  female  black  white  hispanic  asian etc  even as a black gamer  i m sick of it. i ve had the fortune of not having to live such things very often in my life but even if i didn t have that fortune on me  i still wouldn t want constant reminders in gaming  my favorite way to escape reality.
this game s lead character reminds of the first time you run into piper in fallout 4 and all of the weird stuff that was going on with her face. definitely does not do justice to the real life model.
i was also onboard when i saw the teaser and action trailer  but when i played the demo and heard the banter and dialogue i just couldnt enjoy it. i moved my preorder to ff 16 and decided to move on from forspoken.
i just move shit with my mind  give me 70 bucks
11 10 it was only a matter of time before they started inserting their woke fantasies directly into the games story. they are using video games as a tool to depict their imagined view of how society works. south park is a classic example  being black makes it harder and being white is easy mode. this is going to be the new normal  and the goal is to normalize this ideology for young gamers. so when anyone pushes back on their woke cult  they can turn around and say   but in x game...   just like millennials would say   but in harry potter...  for everything. this is what happens when you replace religion based morality  with fantasy based morality. fantasy can be changed to suit the woke cult  which is why they are obsessed with saying religions are fantasy. the entire goal is to establish their woke cult as the new morality guide and even a new religion  a single unified religion which worships yourself over g-d.  satanismingaming
it dropped from 5 in my most wanted to 16 after a pc price of  65 and then all the reviews coming in saying it s meh. they are going for a first week cash grab as they know it s a flop  it will be  20 on steam within 2 months. the fact the character acts like she s in a cw show i could have lived with it  i already knew that. will play it on game pass if it ever appears there.
but...but....frey is so strong! so brave! so bold! so fierce!
i totally agree with ya ! i am from japan and i play square s game alot and my best game is chrono cross ! they really do need focus on jrpg   not like this
this is the way that california writers think that generation z talks. it s the same as how they re convinced the kids in the 90s said totally radical all the time
wait the dialogue is actually amazing and witty . is destiny ish vibes. they is deff a community trying to sack this game on purpose. i watched the first 40 mins of gameplay and story and it s was deep fun.
to be honest the game looked super bland from the get go. i think your right and it s going to flop.
the settings menu lets you cut down the chat between her and the cuff. so they know it s cringe and annoying.
capcom is the only japanese company that can capture the beauty of real people going back to onimusha on ps2.
seen the trailer  was like oh this looks sweet!! downloaded the demo with excitement  was disappointed it just sucked!
i am just gonna say it now  ain t no way in hell i am paying 80-110   here in norway  for a game no matter how well it is made at launch. especially not a game i am actively cringing at.
shirrako dropped the 4k full game. i lasted exactly 38 seconds. lol
it s a re-purpose of agni s philosophy for esg score.
@normanreaddis  what philosophy  only perform at the bare minimum
to be honest  i liked the dialogue on the end of the automated voice. it was the dialogue on the end of the girl that i thought was annoying. it s almost like the automated voice was aware of how annoying she was acting.
good overview  thanks.
she s so pretty i wanna follow her  goddammit melonie
i m going to be honest ella should fire her agent  first charlie s angels 2019  then netflix s series which was supposed to be resident evil and now this i actually feel kind of bad for her!
i was hyped for it at first and every video i saw just took away i was gonna pre order it but i didn t. if i want to play it i ll just rent it from gamely like i did with gotham knights  which is a terrible game if you just do the story for gotham knights with no side missions which are repetitive the main story is a few missions and for some reason tin drake is the only one who can take down big opponents stealthy
the way mel wears her jacket and her top  i thought she was cosplaying as yuna for a minute there lol.
god what the hell s been going on with square enix the past couple years  i was so excited for this game when i first saw it but now probably getting it discounted
for those who ve played control jessie s actress  face is so much prettier than the game model...idk if it has to do with ray tracing or whatever it is they do but it s just weird.
it s weird for me to have hot takes  but i guess i do now. i actually like the dialogue. i put the cuff banter on high. lol
and the award for trying to imitate  tony stark talking to jarvis  goes to  forspoken
it s their own fault. they keep trying to make games nobody wants in genres they don t have experience in instead of finishing the games people do want and sticking with the types of games they do well with.
as a non console gamer since 1990  sounds like eons ago  i ve tried to give square enix the benefit over the years. kids love their stuff  right  final fantasy forever and all that. i tried - i really did. it s just   not   for   me   .
this game about to be forgotten in less than a month
i was honestly totally on board with this game until i heard this dialogue. it s an original property  so there aren t any race swaps. the designs looked cool in the trailers. the gameplay looks sick  so i might still try it out.
yeah  narrating their feelings instead of just having the character show emotions is patronizing at best.  i m angry!
lucky you  because i just watched a preview in german. this is the stuff of  h.p.lovecraftian  nightmares and could potentially trigger the endtimes!
to be fair  i ve heard far worse dialogue. i think the animation is far worse  and tbh dialogue like what she said isn t anything new. there s plenty of characters that acted like talked like her before that nobody had a problem with. i m not saying it s anything special  but i ve heard far worse. i don t think it s  bad   just average. then again  the bar has been set so low nowadays that anything short of a masterpiece is usually given the same reaction. idk  i ve seen far more obnoxious characters get far more love so it is what it is.
a game for modern audiences.
make d pain stop....please
just showed that scene to my 17 year old daughter. she looked at me for minute and just walked away blabbering rubbish rubbish. lol
she is pretty mean to the braclet she wears. he is getting bearated by her often. like it s pretty mean spirited. am i supposed to like her!  haha!
they handed it off to the b team i guess
they made her look like a man pretending to be a women
yeah true  i think i made a mistake and ordered it on amazon
definitely fulfills the definition of  wait until sale .
the dialogue was exactly the same in the demo.
@user-rm9tf9rs6k  i didn t play the demo. haven t had the time.
@fredrickchristen5995  try the demo you ll see.
@fredrickchristen5995  it s a generic 3rd person action combat shooter. if you ve played infamous second son  you ve played this game.don t expect anything revolutionary in terms of game play
@mrmistah1588  well  that s good. i haven t played infamous  second son.
in reference to squeenix squeidos  one of the reasons i like some japanese video games is they don t have a problem with sexy female video game characters  well  unless you re the current leadership of squeenix squeidos.... the people who screwed up lara croft and apparently tifa lockhart   and the devs usually thumb their noses at sjw activists who are out to ruin everyone else s fun. one of the major things i dislike about many japanese video games  especially jrpgs  are their overlong cut scenes that come across more like visual novel  dating sims.  5 minutes of game play   and 30 minutes of cutesy or socially awkward dialogue.
yeah i was looking forward to this until i played the demo and im glad i did it saved me  70
i don t think i ve ever played a square enix game.not a fan of jrpgs.so i must not be american  in spite of being 7 generations american on one side of my family  4 on the other.but i am truly impressed by the way japan never gave up  and eventually won wwii. it took them 40 years  but... persistence...
what hapend to  square enix  its like over night everything changed. they had a good track record of great games and fan suport  and know boom  bad  games  bad ports  bad remakes  shitty monetizations etc ...
o.o that dialogue is straight out of she-hulk. welp another game for me to skip.
i was excited about the cool running and fighting.
this game was bundled with amd 6-series cards. so it will have lots of  sales . i m so looking forward to getting my forspoken game key. not.oh well  at least sniper elite 5 was a good game in the bundle.
this reminds me of the rdcworld1 sketch about pitching a show to a network as a black person. very funny sketch  perfectly describes this situation with the reviewer.
i wonder how epic feels about the first released game built on ue5 being this.
idk about the dialogue or story but the gameplay was pretty fun. the magic was unique and fun.
wtf  i have no idea who you are  never heard of you  literally thought you were another shit bag e girl  but you my dear  nailed everything you talked about in your video perfectly. absolutely incredible  well put  thought out  100  amazing video  mad respect my dear. love the video and subed and liked. keep it up.
i was looking so forward to forspoken... i had high hopes for it...
i don t know if the gameplay is going to be able make up for the god levels of cringe in this game.also  in comparison  death stranding face scans animations were top notch  mads mikkelsen and guillermo del toro were spot on  to name a few. lea seydoux looked beautiful. even square enix s own de  mankind divided facial animations were superb.
she s got all the relatability and appeal of a wet cardboard box.
how is it so many writers today don t understand that characters and dialogue exist for the sole reason of driving the plot  this is season 2 buffy joke material with nothing that compels me to actually want to know what s happening. hell  in shakespeare even the jokes move the plot forward.
im not even mad anymore.. its so tiring. the zero effort mentality in the gaming industry is tideous. vote with ur wallet.. thats the only message they will get
what the hell was square enix thinking melonie remember they had good western developed games like deus ex and sleeping dogs
the polygon article about this game wanted more focus on the  black struggle  and for the game to constantly remind the player of it lol
the dialouge isn t for me though i don t think it s bad. everything i ve heard sounds to be very well performed by talented vas. i don t think it s fair to push the narrative that something is bad just because you don t like it.days gone had a similar issue  among others of course  with the cast and dialogue. many couldn t get into the biker aesthetic and attitude. but it was in no way performed poorly.overall though i agree that i m not into forspokens style.  but again  i do not think the voice acting at least is bad.
it s like disney movie with those dialogue lol
by dead space remake  wanted dead or atomic heart instead.
forspoken is not using ue5 from what i am hearing square enix has their own engine called luminous engine. if this game was made on ue5 i would think the models would look a lot better.
@briangrant9942  it s actually both. ue5 was used to build the environment while luminous handles the visual.
yeah it shows the visual not that great i guess they did that to safe money.
how  even the title sounds really bad  let alone the initial story that was talked about. it was going to be trash  guaranteed. i would have been shocked if it pulled a 180 and turned out great.
square enix didn t develop sleeping dogs  that was united front  who closed down a few years later because of square enix. they re no longer the powerhouse everyone thinks they are.
3 unnecessary s-bombs in a row   that takes talent !
this game comes out tomorrow  i haven t heard anything about this game except hearing how one developer got in trouble for saying the main character had a ghetto walk or something also her hair is so stiff i thought she was wearing a hoody
boomers when making games   hello fellow kids
it s funny  the reason i hate  woke  products often has nothing to do with politics - for example  that clip of forsaken doesn t have anything political in it. no  the reason i hate woke products is because they are almost always poorly-written  derivative  unrealistic  and lacking any sort of intelligence. the style of writing in that forsaken clip looks to be near-identical to the writing style found in she-hulk and the latest saints row game.i grew up on black culture  and more specifically black comedies  thanks to my dad. his favorite show when i was a kid was in living color  and he would show us all the eddie murphy  richard pryor  and wayans bros stuff  back when the wayans were still good.  the reason my dad loved black comedians so much is because they were brutally honest  authentic  and relatable to working class people like himself. woke comedy is the exact opposite. there s not an ounce of honesty or authenticity anywhere to be found  and it caters solely to people who took social justice courses in college. it talks down to the working class  then tells them they are bad people for not liking it.
someone did a side by side comparison with this and an assasins creed game from 2014. the ac game looked far better with more detailed environments and three times as many npc s walking around.
poor ella balinska  from charlie s angels  resident evil now this.
i feel bad for ella balinska. first charlie s angels then resident evil and now this. she needs someone else picking her roles for her.
honestly  the limiting reviewer copies and not giving them out to all these people is the right move. why should gaming journalists get special treatment and receive free game after free game weeks or months earlier than everyone else
square in 1997  barret.square in 2023  fray.
melony is great and more women hopefully follow her example. then there will be hope for the future! more melony  less frosk!
i don t have a problem with the dialog because the main character is from our world. like ash in army of darkness  this is my bomb stick  if i got transported to the middle ages and could do crazy magic i would be talking out my butt to those people. i have a problem with the reported graphics requirement vs. performance output. it s going to be 30 fps for most people. so i ll wait till it s  20.
it s a shame because the game looks so interesting but i agree that dialogue is killing it and i don t mean in a good way.
i never thought god of war ragnarok would have a competitor for having  most annoying characters  this quick  but here we are about 3 months later.
can they come up with something else than this
lmao. so melonie will ban you from her channel if you give crystal dynamics or tomb raider the benefit of the doubt. yet here she is making all these videos on fighting for free speech.  what happened to  practicing what you preach   you can t have it both ways  sorry mel.
this character was designed for people who will find a way to hate it. essentially made for no one.
i bet the dialog is better in  japanese. graphics wise the game is not impressive.  but gameplaywise i think they nailed it on the movement and actions
when i first saw this video  i genuinely thought it was someone s quick creation as a piss take to hogwarts legacy.  this is an actual game !
hi melonie to set another week on the right track with your fabulous video.takecare melonie
and on steam it s pre-purchase price in canada is  93.49.....yeah this isn t going to end well.
except ash was a likable and interesting character.
@user-rm9tf9rs6k  indeed ash is the best
@user-rm9tf9rs6k  and ash doesn t sound like he s missing brain cells.
@jonathanpretty5031  and isn t really mean spirited to those trying to help him.
it s made off of a concept created by amy hennig from what i m aware. looks like they warped it into something bad.
the actress or the model they used as a protagonist was an actress who appeared in a woke feminist movie i think it was charlie s angels. yeah it was a flop.
heck i d argue the western games produced aren t necessarily the problem as it is squenix s stupid leadership. if they aren t pushing games like this that are doomed to fail  they actively get in the way of the actual good games. a good western game can do just as well as their floundering final fantasy games  and squenix would still say  not good enough.
i dont know if this is an unpopular opinion  but i feel that forspoken should have been a t rated game. after playing the demo  there was really no blood or gore  the main character just happens to have a potty mouth. if the devs has simply chosen to tone down the language to match the violence  perhaps that would have helped in marketing.
kane and lynch  dog days    mind jack    the quiet man    left alive    babylon   and now  forespoken  had tarnished an otherwise reputable company like square enix  hadn t it
i played the demo and instantly thought  this is awful  horrible controls  crud combat and laughable dialogue in the way that it s not meant to be funny but is so bad it is funny
i like the remake of tomb rider maybe is me because what i saw on the game is strong woman going from not knowing how to fight or survive to strong woman with crazy surviver skill. yes some part of the games make you want more the old lara croft.
i m glad that so far they are keeping ff16 away from the woke mob. i still have hope.
they had 2 years worth of online feedback to fix the voice acting and scripting. 2 years worth.
this game is the result of not being able to  tell someone they have bad ideas because they may or may not have different physical attributes. when you can t tell someone  no  because of identity politics  this is the result.and anyone who says this game is bad  well  you know the routine.
i was really looking forward to this..then i played the demo
just checked ign review of this and they unexpectedly ripped it apart!
i think all of us here don t really care who we play as in games as long as that character is well written   they don t even have to be a likable person if they are well-made. look at arthur morgan and joel  2 bad men who we might not agree with yet still like them as a character.
the game legit looks good except they made the main character an angsty teen.  i didn t like or understand angsty teens when i was one.   just think if they had made a gandalf or obiwan like character with their magic system i d have bought it without question
it makes you appreciate dark souls and elden ring! the character you play is silent and not an attention seeking valley girl. haha!
wow i noticed that too. devil may cry 5 has excellent facial scan. we have similar opinions on that too...i really hate how fake a lot of games are looking. i ve played shit from 2016 that looks better than the crap they re giving us.
i don t think its fair to judge a game that s not even out yet but even so this game is in a very awkward position. i do think sony was going to buy square but the activision deal played a roll into that. forspoken is a ps5 and pc exclusive but looks like it could run on a ps4 so maybe it was planned to be on both consoles at one point. they do that kh2 thing where some cutscenes look really good but gameplay and other moments are not as polished. plus to reschedule this game to be next to hogwards legacy which has such similar themes. definitely feels like they want to use that to either get players from that or just have hogwarts legacy overshadow it. i played the demo for forspoken and the magic feels more powerful then hogwarts legacy but is it more fun  idk. the dialogue is not as bad as velma tho so it has a shot. this game reminds me of like a days gone how it s not for everybody but i do think it can grow an audience. also horizon and ghost of tsushima feel as dense as forspoken so i don t quite get the density thing.
yes it s painful but check out dead space remake  it might improve your mood. ea  and motive  actually haven t  done fucked it up  for a change.
i like the dialouge from what i ve seen of it so hard.
it s sad to see another highly anticipated game come out and be trash because of woke content and cringe dialogue to me it looked nice but the  open  world looked empty and the point to point cut seen to cut seen gameplay made me look for my next game elsewhere hi-fi rush now that s a good game!!!
i knew square enix was heading down a bad path when they started changing tifa lockhart to appease the twitter mob.
it was initially a tech demo called agni s philosophy but was re-purpose to appease the esg score.
@normanreaddis  oh yes i remember that. why didn t they stay faithful to that demo agni s philosophy
@timmytimmymit5607 esg score
it s a re-purpose agni s philosophy in the name of  equity .
@cloudstrife4324  indeed she still looks great but give them an inch and they will never stop taking.
some things are best left unforspoken.
melonie  please understand  you  i and probably alot of your fanbase here are rpg fans  veteran gamers no less  so we re used to adult dialogue written from an adult s pov with cultural moral nuances sprinkled in.but in this case  they re trying to appeal to who they think are the woke western crowd because they want new young consumers  whales  to support se for yrs to come. the protag has to come off like them. its business...just go woke go broke business
once i seen her performance in the resident evil show i knew this game was gonna be bad
final fantasy 7 is still one my my favourite games of all time. if they wanted to inject a westerner into a fantasy game then they could not have created a character that feels any less like me. melonie you hit the nail on the head. we are weebs! give us janapese cheesy fantasy all day long. by the way you used a perfect clip to highlight how annoying that woman is.  i  i  i  me  me  i  look what i did  how cool an i . that got annoying after 5 seconds i don t know how people could stomach 5 hours...you also perfectly highlighted how racism has nothing to do with the negative feedback of this game. when the teaser showed us a black female main character everyone was extremely hyped for the game because the game sounded extremely intriguing and race did not and does not matter. it is not until the game drops and we see all the real issues with it that we start to say how bad the game is.
i can t believe this is a square enix game wow....
let s take a fun open world game with a minority lead. infamous second son had delson rowe a native american misfit street punk with his cop brother reggie as a secondary character. delson has some hipstery moments but they were never this bad. and him being native is very minor as it should be we just seem him with his tribe when some conduits escape. the whole point of the game is to save the life of the elderly tribal women betty who practically raised you and the other tribe members after they are tortured with concrete based super powers that are poisoning them.
the va kind of sounds like melonie. hope yakuza ishin! can help me pass the time for the ff16  dd2  and s.t.a.l.k.e.r. 2 wait.
i just watched the final boss and ending on another video  i can say the dialogue doesn t improve. even the final boss has dialogue that s more like something you d expect from a school shooter rather than an ancient demon
i didn t know you were a devil may cry fan melonie  that s awesome!!!
i mean i pre-ordered this on dec 21 2021 i m in it for the open world haha as well as hogwarts legacy and if ubisoft still stays afloat skull and bones 8f it ever comes out haha
the games i m excited about are hogwarts legacy and spider man 2.
it s funny how the game presents no woke concepts within the narrative  which is what a woke reviewer was complaining about in one of the articles melanie showed  which disappoints them  then you have non-woke people assuming it s woke and complaining about it s non-existent wokeness. this game is getting hit hard on all fronts.
the dialogue just remind me of a cheesy teens movie... like one of those highschool teens...sonic does that in frontiers
who s paying to destroy the gaming industry  it s working.
its not only the dialogue...there s this jarring disconnect between that and the animation
only old books are safe now  but i get a feeling they might start to edit old books for modern audience.
i d like a legitimate reason as to why this is as bad as you guys think it is  as someone who s played an unhealthy amount of games i ve heard worse dialog from high budget games. was it cheesy  yea a bit but it wasn t the bad  especially cause it seems self aware with the ai talking back to her understanding that she s a bit arrogant. idk maybe its just me but i ve definitely heard alot worse dialog in videos games than this. now the graphics that s something we can talk about cause that clip looked like it came from ps2 era of gaming. but seriously i just want genuine opinions on why the dialog is so bad maybe i m missing something
i just move shit with my mind this is marvel level humor minus the superheroes
i really don t get why everyone is so iffy about this. the game looks amazing - and i m speaking graphically. the only thing to be cautious about is the performance and optimisation.
if the gameplay is good i ll ignore the dialogue lol i ll wait for the reviews
side note  delsin and reggie were mo-capped  modeled on  and portrayed by two white dudes  troy baker and travis willingham  respectively . i m not even sure you can do that these days  and that game was released just nine years ago. i remember the grief they gave laura bailey  a white woman  for playing nadine  a black character  in uncharted 4. the one thing i appreciated about voice acting was that it side-stepped typecasting  but even that s being destroyed.
hmm i never really noticed that delson was native american  just thought the game was fun and he was an interesting character. cool story as well.
yes  i always use dmc sound snippets for my stream alerts. one of the best game series of all time  d
@meloniemacgoboom  i ve played and beated devil may cry 1  2    3 special edition on my switch  and now i plan of playing devil may cry 4 and 5.
this is what square gets for it s focus on a world audience! just make good games  and the world will buy. make it for a  world audience  is literally making in for a slim few game urinal-ists and their followers.
i was interested in this game and played the demo and then lost interest. i m glad i preordered hogwarts over this. also if you want that classic final fantasy game look forward to cygame granblue fantasy rpg.
i wasn t gonna order it day1. i was gonna wait for the reviews. i m more waiting for harry potter legacy  ff16  and my megaman legacy game.
you can always tell an ip will be crap when the marketing for it is trying to protect it before release....across the board  not just in gaming
this is what happens everywhere atm in all sectors  games  movies even politics... the world is lowering its quality due to political messenges wich our society feels must be done. fu.. this if the  new  generation like s crap like that i am damn proud to be a kid of the 90 s then. where creativity and talent was more important than having titts and being black.
squenix should just create more ps1 era kind of games. i love those games like ff7 8 9  fftactics  vagrant story  xenogears  chrono cross  front mission. why dont they just make entertaining games and not  smash you in the head with politics.
as a gamer of many years and fan of sqaursoft  this game is great  graphics are great better than most games out  gameplay is awesome and interesting  no problem with dialogue  have to disagree with your take 100 .
they will make it up with 16 and rebirth.
as soon as i saw the main characters hair i knew this game was gonna be bad.
yeah i played the demo and i was like wow this is really bad dialogue
that dialogue and voice acting is why i play the vast majority of jrgp with japanese audio. only the ffvii remake has good english voice acting out of every jrpg in the last decade. people that play in english are missing out on better experiences. the japanese sell the emotions and humor better because  well  the games are made by japanese devs. go figure.
if the dlc has a new protagonist  new enemies and a new plot... only then will i be down.
... hooray another  sooo funny  game. oooh they even make sure you can t move when bracelet talks to you hooray! that really makes my day!
cue walter sobchak from the big lebowski   oh this poor woman! ohhh this poor woman!!  at the 14th minute mark and when you rightly point out this stereotype in all forms of media.
i love the dialogue game is so good
the dialogue is absolutely amazing. mindblowing ha ha ha ha.
sony must be kicking themselves at their hq regretting buying exclusivity for this game
it has the  unreal engine  look
razorfist said it best square enix has been trying to court the american audience to its own detriment.
the last few square games have been duds   babylons fall  star ocean the divine force    now this.  what the hell is going on over there now
also the fact that this game has a 70 price point but hogwarts is 60 for pc
btw fortune  from mgs2 is a badass....so the race card is out
square didn t make resident evil or devil may cry. that s capcom s re engine. still  square has made much better looking character models than this in the past. not sure if ff15 and 16 use face-scanning on real actors  but they look and animate a lot better than this.
the dialogue also phoned it in for me. the gameplay  environments  combat mechanics and animations  it all looks so great. the moment she opens her mouth  at any moment  is just insufferable. the script is horrendous.
3 10 melonie mac goes boomer
i have a token to get this game for free  and i m not even sure if i should. maybe if sweet mods are made  but we ll see.
game needed another 1-2 years dev time..  ..and some skript   dialogue testing
i ve been playing thr game all day  it s actually quite good. writing in most games are  going to be cringe to one demographic or another. the game is good though. so w e
yep....called it from the demo and people said i was being  rude  and  judging to quickly .
the first teaser of project athia looked awesome. like tomb raider with magic. now the end result is just dog shit.
the bad part is that many will pay this if it was for free . 80  is hilarious  you will see some v and b   buying this.
the demo spooked me.  it was no fun and didn t feel like a square enix game.
jesus  square enix has totally gone down the toilet  it s unbelievable how much they ve changed for the worst since they stopped being squaresoft.
every time i see v from devil may cry my brain autocorrects his name to adam driver
this feels like a poor bootleg infamous game. now i just want to go back and play as cole.
creative business unit 3.  nuff said.
it looks like it might be okay. even though i am a straight white male  i find that in the game world i like to play as a strong independent lesbian black woman to live out my power fantasy. game devs really know their audiences.
other than being an isekai this game feels so non japanese im still confused to how the japanese even made this lol
the chick they used for their main character was in that super woke movie run sweetheart run. i couldn t even finish the movie it was so bad.
i love how final fantasy strangers in paradise has this same problem and yet i don t hear people shitting on it because it s  a  final fantasy
never go full woke
i literally play japanese for the japanese vibe not to play games that feel like what the west already makes.square which was my 1st real gaming company i loved because of ff7 but more specifically ff9.stay with japanese content
in cbu3   yoshi p we trust! buy dozen of copies of final fantasy xvi
the devs are luminous productions  the same devs who made ff15 which is arguably the most hated final fantasy aside from spirits within so...
been watching a yt walkthrough of the game. main character swears like a proverbial sailor! f bomb city.
these are gen z writers today  who probably are in a writing group with only other gen z writers.
a lot of people are hating on the game   they want to bash the game   it s not great sure   but it s still a good game   the only problem is that it has a lot of spoken dialogue   maybe a little too much   but that s about it   it has great combat   clean graphics   it s cool too listen at first when they talk about the game   but then forget what they tell you   give the game a chance   play the game   if you like it buy it   thinking it would have been cool if they had a option to turn the spoken dialogue off   but for me other way i like the spoken dialogue it wasn t annoying   actually very funny   but it is a lot   i wish it wasn t so much of it it s funny she s talking about the character hair but look at hers   lol wow the spoken dialogue in this game is getting a lot of controversy
social studies students becoming writer lmao!!
as genx i love thatall genshate genz.even younggeny are likeuh no im amillennial.
if you want to see a well-written strong female character  look no further than beth in yellowstone! feminine  intelligent  and a total bad-ass.
dang it i like your videos!
coming from square enix  and looking at the gameplay  it looked very much like ffxv so i had some exception of what we were getting as well as the type of dialogue we d get but man  this was way too much. that original teaser vs now look night and day in terms of tonealso speaking as a poc  idk why game devs can t just focus on making a good story and the protagonist just happens to be a poc
samus aran is a girl and one of the most bad ass girls in gaming  shes been around for ever.  its when you change a character to a different thing i have an issue. like why  just have an original idea for a change. i don t care about the race or sex if the character and game is good.
i totally disagree that se should be sticking with jrpg s when in reality they ve made some excellent titles outside the genre. saying se should stick to jrpg s is like saying that capcom should stick to sf games or konami mgs.as for forespoken yeah the reviews aren t looking great se should get praise for going outside their comfort zone.
i played the demo for 5 min. wasn t impressed by the gameplay or the gfx but honestly kinda just quickly took a glance at the game instead of giving it a real chance. but the gameplay seemed... eh
this is gonna be free on ps plus in a year  just watch
chrissie should do a parody called  froskspoken.
that clip you showed legitimately looks like a ps3 game from 2009.
the japanese dub is actually pretty good
everytime se  appeals  to a western audience  the game flops  even when some of those games are good.  so  i do agree  they need to stick to what they are good at.
maybe ......... this is that start of her character arc  where she learns to be humble
it s sad for the wokies cuz it is possible to make really great games with progressive themes without being overly cringe or shoe horned...tlou 1 and horizon zero dawn are great examples.
is this a new show on the wb  were the writers from velma involved
well  i ve been enjoying fire emblem so far
much like jill in resident evil 3 remake. i guess they think a potty mouth makes a woman more bad    and tough
i can kill g4 with my mind!
doubt it.
i m tiried of playing games that are cut-aways and serialized mini-films.  it s like  the left can t meme  version of gaming where everything is endless text.
i kinda feel for the lead actress  first she was in charlie s angels reboot  then netflix s resident evil show   now this.i think she needs to fire her agent.
at this point  the hate for this game is od. i ll never understand how opinions is made without giving it a chance.
they fly now..they fly now ..they fly noowww!!!
well  i ll just wait for capcom to drop resident evil 4 remake  and wait for the announcement of dmc 6. because man  is the west just doing poorly with games lately  i played dmc 5 special edition with vergil and man that game is unbelievably awesome   from characters  to music  to gameplay and story.
never  ever  trust cinematic trailers. they are designed to get people hyped for the game. leading up to the release of the game they always release in-game footage in which you seen here. then you can decide to be excited or not. never trust trailers.
i think all the  complaints  are from ppl who secretly like it. or you wouldn t give it oxygen.
i thought it was funny  still gonna play it cause why not see what it s about before throwing the whole game into the trash before it comes out  i m starting to see a reoccurring pattern with you and colored characters.
lara croft was a god damned super-hero.
even ign gave it a 6 which basically means it s terrible
i m not against developers who tried to expand their market  but this is not how you do it. they may tweak or create an entirely new gameplay mechanics but never abandon their identity. elden ring is a good example. it tried to grasp new market by making it open world  while not abandoning their identity as a hardcore action rpgthe best se game i played recently is dragon quest xi. that game is peak square enix for me. they should infuse forspoken with the same identity instead of modern culture
saw this coming from a mile away.
this will be good for square if they learn the lesson and fire the team. they should fire the writers and remake the gamed with jap writers
i been watching a play through of this of asmongold.  it s hilariously bad lol. which is a shame because i was excited for it till realised it was bad.
what s with this mcu movie like dialogue in most games these days where almost every bit of conversation with a world of mystifying lore  depths of the unknown  and life threatening stakes there s either a deadpool-ish or starlord character with a stick-up-the-ass comedic sidekick
i ll be honest i m not buying the game but the dialogue isn t that bad. feels like something i see in movies a lot. not bad but definitely not good either
you wouldn t like melonie when she s angry
this game looked so good for the 20 seconds or so when they were showing gameplay and then looked like shit as soon as that chick started talking. it s so funny to me that the best way to appeal to western audiences is to just make japanese rpgs
dialogue reminded me of she-hulk
i beat parasite eve for the first time in my life over the christmas break. if i can pick any random piece of dialogue from a 25 year old ps1 game and cringe less than i did after hearing that clip  square enix has fallen.
because they ve been burned enough.
i agree bud. american games are hot trash where the japanese games kick ass.
@mrhalo087  don t forget metal gear rising  frikin good game music and gameplay  story  ehh
if ign gave it a 6 real score is 4.
forspoken had the right ingredients to be good and we get a disappointing meal of sadness.
why would borewoken being a flop be bad for square enix it would send all the right signals to them  so that they can learn from this obvious mistake and make better games in the future.if it did not flop  we would just get more of this trash.
i take it you re not buying the super deluxe version
not kidding  hearing a few lines i would stop playing the game immediately. as someone who plays games for experiences this actually takes me out of the experience and it s a shame because it looks nice. but a game cant be about looks alone  it has to have a good story and good dialogue. if i m coughing out 70 bucks for a game it has to be worth it. this ain t it. i was out when i saw the trailer. im done now.
it totally looks like a flop so far  the steam hype engine kinda slowed down  and i can personally tell the difference as i was hyped for the game the same type of way as elden ring but now i don t really care nor will buy it because it s hella expensive. the audience s gossip about the game isn t great and the marketing of the game feels off. the game isn t even in the store for the major audience  maybe in a few days it will shatter the internet. but i ve seen this with lemnis gate  multiplayere experience with a cheaper price tag  and didn t end well  hope i m wrong
i can t wait for ff16
i m so happy to see a young sassy black girl being powerful and independent and sassy. did i say sassy
imagine wanting to actually buy this.
careful using devil may cry as a  good example!  this game reminds me of dmc  2013  s dante.
forspokens pc requirements are so off the chain and ridiculously od that the fact that it still plays on 720p with 30 frames a second is absolutely garbage.square enix gotta put this in a dumpster fire and make this a tax write off.
she looks like an ff15 npc. love those melted crayon faces.
i m just hoping ff16 is good.although creative business division 3 has a better track record than luminous productions.
and i shall continue to play diablo 2.
maybe on pc  someone will do a mod to remove some of the obnoxious dialogue.
thinking having a black woman as the main character and some tiktok dialogue then calling it a day will make people love this game maybe they are american
good stories sell games when will they learn
first trailer looked really good  then it s been all downhill from there.
come ooooon stellar blade save us from this horror
no qualification is the qualification.ill play ff7 over and over before i play anything wokified
so  does this game let you configure your character  or would i have to play this character as shown   because  to be truthful  she s a complete turnoff.
to be fair  identity politics aside  is that not simply characterization  are there not sassy people irl  heck  some of the most well-known fictional characters are sassy  condescending  selfish  rude  or straight up assholes that get better.
@icebearnicho8256  i happen to think that all stereotypes are true  and so it s no problem to me personally.
i wasn t referring to the ninja theory one obviously lol  i specifically showed pictures of dmc5 and pretty sure i even said capcom  who did not make dmc  the spinoff reboot
ironically it s the same development team that made ff15
the cringe dialogue was already present there aswell.
uncanny valley shelly
so they actually let someone from la write the isekai  shame
its a best seller on steam so i doubt it will flop. especially because consoles don t have games so they buy everything when it comes out.
character personality is what modern media  be it games  movies  music  lacks. i ll have a pass on this one... and rather play some old games again.
the dialogue is cringe but the game s main problem is that it s boring world and awkward combat controls. also with the face scans  it looks like they didn t bother to animate it outside certain key scenes.
so buy is when it is  5  got it
to be fair those are probably the lowest graphic settings in the game because anything else needs a bleeding edge pc to play and the consoles are upscaling from like 480....
great video thanks
that level of dialogue was getting tiresome by the start of the ps4 era. i remember the infamous second son character getting flack for being a bit out of date. in this era it s beyond tiresome.
i just moved shit... with my heckin freckin mind  haha! yeah  that s something i do now. kill jacked up beasts with magic and spout cringe inducing dialogue.
didnt get to play. was watching a bit of the radbrad. dialogue does seem unfortunately wooden in some parts and trying to be like an 80s 90s adventure inx others but gameplay did look sorta interesting
it is the fourth bestselling game on steam. doesn t matter if it is good or not  it has already made a profit. so no... not a flop.
shame. i love final fantasy and i hate to see this happening to square enix.
boy it looks like se put the f team on this game...
it sounds like cw arrowverse dialogue.  seriously  no exaggeration.  that s the kind of  i m so quirky that i can t even talk like a human being  level of dialogue flash and arrow had.  hence why i no longer watch those shows.
definitely in the uncanny valley.
i mean it is option to turn down voice volume no reason to hate the game
glad i saved money not getting this game
ok for the most part i ve been a squresoft squareenix dude since ff7 and chrono cross and when i saw the project athea teaser trailer i was hyped. but since seeing this footage i am losing my loyalty to se when they make stuff like this.
i actually liked the demo  i know it s not the finished game  but i personally think it s going to be a fun gamealso you guys know you can shut the dialogue off yeah
they re now officially an esg company.
@normanreaddis  highly saddening
luminous productions are the developers  who made ff15
square enix just destroy now i i i  lol
no wander gaming is going in the toilet when they have writers like these on their teams. a ten year old would write a better dialogue than this
square enix refunded
i was so hyped for this game when it was announced   idk what happened to it!  it looked so great at the reveal   then this demo dropped   it looks nothing like what we saw at the reveal!  this game should ve been on the ue5   if it was this game would have been so much better. the dialog is awful. the only thing that looked fun was combat   traversing the world. even this game going on sale won t get me to buy it.
the game itself looks good.  but snippets of dialogue even in the trailers was kringy.  when i heard about the minimum requirements for the game  i said  no.   i would have to spend more money than the game itself for upgrades to run it at recommended.  no  i don t do that.
i found the banter back and forth kinda funny  but that s me
i like the dialogue. it was a fun interaction between the 2 characters. i like how she completely ignored the ethereal voice that was speaking to her   took all the credit. i can see the potential of a good story with these characters  judging from that small clip. it s not absolute trash dialogue like saints row. it s not like jrpgs are known for great dialogue either.
but melonie!!!! im seeing freaking dragons!!!!!! im done lol sounds like someone who ate too much sugar and chugged a billion red bulls lol
yea i watched alanna play the demo  and it looks good as in the world. but the character comes across a bit narcissistic  and after a while she is going to get annoying. i ve played similar games with a chatty character  and when overdone it gets frayed. as for her being black  i don t see that as being any kind of issue. can we not just have good well written characters  male or female white or black does not matter. but give them personality and depth  so many games now the characters are forgettable and i don t care. when you read say a good book with well written characters  you feel something for them. which drives the story and gives you some feeling and emotion  if you can put that into a game format it would be really good. but most certainly modern games  the characters are very one dimensional. and a sprinkling of current agenda politics  and it s just going to be a nope for most people. gaming is supposed to be escapism  but a lot of games have lost that whole concept. sorry square enix i think it s another flop  just stick with final fantasy people like that.
the dialogue of this game felt like the opening dialogue of witcher  blood origin....there  ruined the game for everyone else. xd
this game is going to break square enix.
kinda sad  i thought this looked like it might be decent. story graphics you mangled monsters!
hey square enix  what did we learn     get woke  go broke. never again square enix  never again.
i knew this game was gonna be trash after playing the demo.... i couldn t get through it just based off the voice acting
bro this is how you know a game isn t polished enough. her face doesn t even emote when she reacts to what she just did. and they give her like the same bored  blank face even when she s smiling. they can t even do decent work on animating her face properly. the hell is this
i m not too picky  i can enjoy the game and tolerate the dialogue simply bc i don t give a sh t and just want to play a fluid game where i can be a powerful character destroying their enemies. has nothing to do with politics  race or any of that other bs. not that difficult  people are so hard to please .
i m hearing on other youtube sites recommended settings for pc is a 4060. wtf it must be poorly optimized.
had high hopes for this game. still do. but they did ella dirty with those graphics and that dialogue
they shoud ve let witch cry on it s own and leave the wokes writers out of it  i just feel sad for luminous production they will take the heat.
i ll ask chatgpt to create dialogs  -
i know that s not you mel. i remember you telling us about these replies on one of your videos a little while ago can t remember which one. i remember you saying you had tried to get this to stop but it won t unfortunately.
it was funny maybe first couple of lines but dragging on made it cringe
i want an escape......  there s the problem. you want to wind down after a long day  you want to get away from the real world for a while. however  that can not be allowed. you must have  the message  force-fed to you 24 7! no comfort  white or otherwise   no fun  no escapism. it must be a constant barrage  all day every day! it truly saddens me that the company that brought us the final fantasy series has fallen into this  bend the knee  garbage. i so hope that none of these devs worked or are gonna work on ffxvi. that s the only game i m looking forward to atm.
did you put the graphics on max
this game was flamed after the 2nd demo  but the fact this is related to horizon is its biggest downfall. a massively successful game against an unreleased game that will never be close to that level. was deaf before it started.
that dialogue clip was pretty weak.  but  why isn t anybody focused on critiquing the gameplay i get sometimes a bad aspect can easily become a deterrent.  i did not like that clip but  i played tenchu on ps1 for the gameplay.  maybe dialogue that s just bad and not accidentally comical could have a breaking point for me  as well.  but  if it s fun to play  i ll want to play it.  the original version of silent hill 2 had stale  wooden  awkward vo dialogue.  but  it was such an effective psychological horror and good to play.  the good voice acting is just the cherry on top of the updated graphics.people are now trying to say hogwart s legacy has this social politics stuff in it so everyone should hate it.  but  sjw people want everyone to boycott it because  j. k. rowling.  they should demo the hogwart s game to let people make their own decision.we do need every reviewer to point out bad writing and vo  etc.  so  it appropriately impacts sales and profits and that the developers understand exactly why.  so  it can change.if i could be a one man army making games  i would hope to make a good game with out politics in the game.  i m sure all different groups would still politicize it  each their own way to hate it because  everyone seems to just be looking for bs to get riled up about.
the dialogue kinda reminds me of infamous 2. might have been a refference. i actually like 2. it iwas very..qwuipy  alot of media has that quality nowadays.
dialogue probably is trash  but i m here for the gameplay and powers. basically a america final fantasy where you play as a black girl.also  the first time seeing the character in the game  i wasn t thinking about her being black. but more about we ll be playing as a girl character that s black. no complaints here. lol
woof i dodged a bullet there by canceling on this one.  time to buy another hogwarts legacy!
i think there s an actual beauty in all day one release games. any game will look terrible the first week but there s always that update time frame. the last of us  part 2  there were terrible dialogue at some points but over 3 months  they updated it to fix it. i still have high hopes for this game and i can t wait to play it.
i remember a time during the 360 ps3 days over at capcom. damn near sent the company into the abyss because keji inafune thought that what they needed to be doing to sell more games was to make their games more like the west. thats how you got trash garbage dumpster fires like dead rising ii   a game so bad they literally remade it with the old main character frank west and added back in all the things that made the first game fun   shopping dmc out for the dreaded dmc reboot that no one asked for  and all but ignored and forgot about storied franchises such as megaman....their company mascot! finally they relented and got their head on straight and their shit in gear and went back to making their games like how they used to and wouldnt you believe it  they started selling well  again!moral of the story   do not imitate the west! just be yourself japanese devs!
mac daddy has spoken.
yeah... i stopped being hyped for games when i realized lately none of them are as good as they said they were going to be.
forwoken coined by the lord king of the iron lords.   he was pissed that they finally put a black main character.  then they have her resisting arrest right in the beginning of the game.if the game was good no one would care.  bad game and woke   then the memes will begin
i mean  this shit is oscar-worthy compared to the dialogue from the saints row reboot  so i mean  it could be a lot worse.
this actress has been in a lot of woke media.
i tried a free demo of the game and whilst not the worst game i ve played recently  i do agree that the dialogue is cringe.
i m scared for final fantasy xvi. if they screw that up i m done with square.
this is millennial writing in a nutshell  constantly pointing out the blatantly obvious multiple times because they don t think people have enough intelligence to understand what literally just took place right in front of their eyes.also  visually  the game looks like a quick-and-easy unreal engine tutorial.
1 50  dialogue wasn t bad  it was just  unconscious . imagine if you discover to have some superpower. can you foresee your reaction  no. it would likely be stupid  like 4 07.	of course  however  current technology wasn t ready for that. it went far from reality.
they should replace all of the dialogue with random fart sounds. it won t make the game sound any better  but at least it would be good for a few cheap laughs.
so many people hate mobbing on this game for no reason  sure it s got its flaws but it s not that bad or the worse thing ever created. i m more of a gameplay type of player  for me it s gamplay first story second. now i m not saying i want the story of everything i play too be dog shit but as long as it s fine and engaging that s good enough and all that matters too me. at first it wasn t really vibing with me and i think the marketing for forspoken just was not very good at promoting this game but after finally seeing gameplay an watching you play it yesterday on stream of the full release  yeah it seems really fun and the dialogue isn t really that bad like i have seen much much worse then this. if anything it can be pretty funny at times. only issue i really got so far is that certain animations look a little stiff and the character model s look kind of dated  i feel those could of been much better given this is a 2023 morden aaa release. though i still don t think the graphics justify it needing a rtx4080 16gb and 32gb of ram too run it on ultra settings on pc  it looks fine but nothing graphically phenomenal or ground breaking graphics here.
you don t update dialogue and major graphics after day 1. after day 1 is for post game content and cleaning up bugs  not making the graphics look better. you are in denial
consoomer alert.
they will somehow turn this into  gamers hate it just because she is black!
the original resident evil for the ps1 had better dialogue and acting
once i saw how poorly they optimized the game for both pc and ps5  i knew everything else was gonna be crap.
usually when a game has bad voice overs or bad script i just play it in french or play the entire game to the bee gees. i don t understand french.
come on now you cant say all the dialog in the game is bad off of one clip  .there are a lot of games that have some parts where the dialog is awful but the rest is great so
i really hope ff16 is better.
rudolph tom nowadays never get hyped for a game until you actually play them... trailers can be super deceiving
games from japanese companies like square enix and capcom are usually known for their endearingly cheesy humor and deliberately clunky dialogue  so idk. they ve turned it into an artform at this point. i am somewhat relieved at ella balinska s voice acting this time around  because she phoned in everything in the reveal trailer that was dropped a while back.
she must be based off a girl who works at google that the dev team knew.
i m not familiar with the forspoken franchise and even to me this looks and sounds average... isekai d character from modern world and slang is dropped into magical world and discovers abilities and powers as the chosen one saviour
i see only one person actually likes the game in a video i have watched
imagine a game that mixes final fantasy with the bible
i had a weird feeling from the first trailer that showed a lot of flashiness and very little else. then we got a longer trailer and i couldn t help but notice every character shown being female  usually a red flag for being woke in today s climate  and turns out it s worse than i thought. because the dialogue is atrocious. the amount of copium i ve seen from people that perpetually live on twitter is ridiculous lol this game is a major flop from square enix.
so... i m confused... you think square enix can t woke a jrpg
it looks like every game this year is gonna have a bame millennial chick as the lead. time for the classics again.
i feel like i m watching a ps3 game that was made by a new studio with nothing but woke developers.
resident evil has bad dialogues but still is a successful video game franchise
these so called game journalist have obviously never played any games in their miserable life. telltales the walking dead lee will forever be one of the greatest and memorable character to be written without constant reminder that he s black while being oppressed. they even threw in a joke about it too but didn t go overboard with it.
wasnt the only reason but was one of the main ones why i deleted the demo rather quickly.  will not pay more than 20 bucks  if that  for this one.  major disappointment.
i totally disagree with this review and a lot of other reviews like this.   so far  i ve played 6 hrs of forspoken  and i ve enjoyed every minute.   yes  there are a few to many dialogues and maybe some breaks in combat.  but i love the game. it s my pace. not everyone will agree with everyone else.  but i m not disappointed at all.
no  that s just bad voice direction.it s not endearing unless you re a certified weeabo or whatever too into bad anime slice of life or loli  whatever s popular nowadays
except she s a mary sue and her magical bracelet instantly tells her how awesome she is
@mrmistah1588  i think its different in games. in tv series f    that shit  but most game protagonists are always going to be saviours heroes chosen ones aren t they  could do without the bracelet telling me how awesome she is though
xenogears
@xenofanallen3218  oh yeah i ve played xenogears it does have some bible elements in there
i rather play xenogears instead of  forspoken
i was thinking of a jrpg that s takes place in the bible but with final fantasy elements
re had cheesy  campy dialogue that was charming  this is on a whole other level of beyond obnoxious
they should bring back sleeping dogs. if they still own the up
thank god i picked up fe engage instead. i m sick to death with this modern era of writing insufferable narcissistic type protags that quip every other second  -
melanie  go back to 1997  and imagine you re an adult that spent their teens playing ff2 on the snes.  we got ff vii and when the dialogue came up  i wanted to pop the cd out of the ps.  i did not like the dialogue.  square doesn t do dialogue well  at all. after two and a half decades  they have never improved that position in her company.
if only we got philosophy agnis instead.
you re gonna love this david scott jeffe  the director of the original god of war says that the reason forspoken is getting the reviews it s getting is because of and i quote   the a-holes who clearly don t like women  black people  or playstation . which can believe that i mean even playstation players don t like this game due to the dialogue and how lifeless the game feels also david scott jeffe said he ll be buying the game just out of spite because of those  a-holes . it s just virtue signaling he s doing and y know what he s being heavily mocked because of it cuz i don t think this is the first time he s done something like this according to the article i read.
square enix because f you guys  - jontron.
watched a streamer play this for a bit  and damn  does it look kinda jank. looks like a small budget title masquerading as a aaa.
people are just done. the silent majority is just done with all the wokeness. and not so much done with people of color or women being heroes per se. that s not and never was an issue.   but they are done with casting them for the sake of being woke. there is a difference.i also think the bigger issue here is that people are done with heroes with attitude. they are done with the anti-hero.  personally  i was done with it in the mid to late 90s when video games started to  grow up . but especially now  people are looking for heroes that provide aspiration and inspiration.  all of us have the capability to be d!cks and b!tches. it s too easy for these heroes to be angry jerks. and us too. people miss their heroes as beings that require us to reach to become even a fraction of the goodness and greatness they represent.  i m personally sick of trash heroes. the only  change  i want is to go back to how it used to be.
gosh forgive me but you are just so gorgeous  intelligent  your a gamer and real down to earth i like this channel
as someone who s lived in new york all my life  ign s first 15mins of gameplay was actually pretty funny... not good  but funny. when the complete edition gets a deep discount i ll pick it up. i ll also say that this  journalist  chose one of the absolute worst places to try   make that argument with.
anyone else here watch acg s review of this game and decide to save their money  lol.
i can feel the magic gauntlet s frustration at being stuck with this plastic protagonist.
i honestly didn t think dialogue could get cringier than borderlands 3 .
we tried the free demo download  game was not good  felt like a low budget game with a lot of problems.
square has just lost it  used to love the final fantasy games  the franchise has pretty much died after 10.
bro just give people what they been waiting for give people prince of persia
it s not good writing  certainly not dostoevsky  but it s tolerable.  i ll probably turn off the chatter  but if the gameplay stays as decent as it was in the demo then i won t necessarily hate myself for paying full price.
why i didn t see such a push to promote remember me  back in 2013  it features a black woman as protagonist... well  anyway  the game is on sale now  on steam  for 80  off  as 01 23 2023 .
guess my  misogyny  paid off. spider senses screamed at me when i saw this.
i played the demo and it s got a lot more problems than dialogue. i found the banter funny enough  though it would almost certainly get tiresome after the 20  hours of gameplay that games like this typically have.i m personally far more concerned about the fact that the demo left me wondering what exactly was special about this game. it s another open world game in a sea of nothing but open world games. the combat is not enjoyable. the control scheme for it doesn t help. it looks good enough  but i don t feel like this pushes my ps5. and the parkour movement that was supposed to be the game s trademark was very lackluster. you basically have a fast dash and a long jump.the entire game overpromised and underdelivered  as seems to be the norm for almost all of these large companies today.
it reminded me of infamous second son or control.but it played far worse and just doesn t stand out. a generic 3rd person action combat shooter
@mrmistah1588  exactly my point. it reminds you of something else that was better  lol. i had high hopes for the game. it s too bad that it didn t deliver. even based on early reviews  i had faith that the game still had time to improve. but after playing that demo  oooofffffff...
everything i ve seen about that game recently is low tier and cringe. almost shocking to think  given it s quality we see now  it did show some earlier promise.
a bit overdramatic. the dialogue is bad but you re blowing it completely out of proportion for such a tiny segment. as a jrpg fan this doesn t come close to as bad as some of the dialogue i ve heard yet i still enjoy some of those games. i agree with the character model though  looks completely bland in this scene. i don t have high hopes for this game but i ll reserve judgement until the game actually comes out.
they got the title wrong for release. should ve been titled forwoken.
as someone who was a young kid in the 90 s  i know square enix is capable of so much better than this. especially their super nintendo titles like final fantasy iii  secret of mana  breath of fire  chrono trigger  and final fantasy tactics. this low effort garbage is just an abomination and they should be ashamed of themselves.
i seem to keep having to ask the same question  who the fuck is this made for
when i played the demo i couldn t stand how bad the dialog is. the main character is so damn rude and she is so cringe. her armband is trying to help her the whole time and all she does is tell him to shutup and that she doesn t need his help. she s in another world and doesn t know much about it. but she s strong and don t need no man even if it s an armband that is alive that also givers her powers to survive.the game also felt dead and not because of the plot. it just didn t really have many creatures or animals in many locations. it just felt empty at times.also  i agree the voice actress is freaking gorgeous and the graphics don t do her justice.
spaz talks about how she hates hyper active girl acting crazy in this crappy video game.
that s how woke women talk though  so at least it s accurate
this game was doomed from the get go. the actress who plays the protagonist has been in so many flops in recent years. some of them very recognizable ips
@12 53 exactly that. ppl trying to get brownie points in saying statements to get pats on the back. i find it insufferable and usually those ppl are not the champions that they project they are.
frey s face looks swollen and her teeth are just... uncanny... we know se can do better than that  but obviously they just didn t care to try.  also this game is  70 base price on pc. kinda expecting a premium experience and kinda not seeing it.
square enix needs to get rid of the ethics dept. for real.
japan  please...please never become the west! please!!!!!! we like your stuff! because you guys are awesome! please  stay awesome. and there is no way in hell i m buying this game. this reminds me of how white people i ve met  meet black people and try talking slang  as if we re too stupid to understand english  or they re trying to be cool.yes the west is stupid   but then everything just gets watered down to stereotypes. yes stereotypes do come from somewhere  i m not even against stereotypes completely  but japan  your stories and writing is so different and unique  which is why i love manga and japanese horror. old school anime like akira and ninja scroll...the west has enough bad entertainment  it feel like square wants in on the bad entertainment. why !
clearly for-woke-n.     smh
people in general play games to escape the real world. why would a black person if they are facing that issue in real life  its a possibility  want to jump into a game and have to face it there too. or if they er not facing it why would they want to jump into a game and have to face it to begin with. it just sounds stupid to me. 99 percent of people just want a good game with a good story that is a complete game on release day and not an alpha version that we pay full price for that they decide to finish makeing after people stop playing it.
the fact that she is acting as if she is better than the  braclet man  who gave her powers throughout the game makes me hate her
same as sarah ryder  mass effect andromeda  and her face model.
jrpgs are a dying or largely niche genre.. i think square needs to look at how elden ring basically stole elements of wrpgs and built a good experience out of them..even the recent resident evil games are like a self contained trilogy if theres a 3rd  combining new elements familiar to western players.best example i can give is the next final fantasy should be closer to what cyberpunk 2077 gave us. if they insist on  turn based  incorporate what dragon age does. the jrpg genre grew stagnant to the point of stale..the recent remakes only show me that fresh paint doesnt hide a lack of innovative gameplay. its why kingdom hearts blew up the way it did while being a jrpg game
whoever wrote the script to this game needs their a   kickin lol
i do not understand why every writer now seems to think cringe knock off marvel dialogue is what people want. that  freaking dragons  clip that went viral is actually even worse in full context in the game. it s baffling to me that everyone involved heard that dialogue and said  this is fine   it s awful and cringe. and this actress  genuinely i feel like they keep putting her in lead roles because she s pretty or some shady dealings are happening behind the scenes because she has terrible delivery  some actors can take stupid jokes and make them land by how they set it up and deliver it but this woman had the same issue in netflix resident evil  her delivery makes it even more cringe and unnatural. and the most frustrating part is that  instead of blaming the bad writing  voice acting  casting  character designers pacing  ridiculous system requirements  etc  they ll try to spin it to say people hate it because the lead is a female of color when the game would be no better if it was a white male lead.
mass effect andromeda had better facial animations and dialogue
really wish they d stop writing games for reddit
square enix really trying to cater to the western audience  meanwhile  other japanese game developers are still developing games without thinking about the western audience in mind  and making a great game through  cultural appropriation  of european culture.and the dialogue reminds me of wolfenstein youngblood. cringe af
bought a ps5 to play this game based off the gameplay teaser...dialogue trailer dropped and now im embarrassed
the game is not as bad as y all want it to be.
i ve literally heard the same levels of cringe in marvel movies. i m not going to give this movie hell for what works for a billion dollar franchise. i m surprised marvel disney hasn t tried to aquire the rights yet.
on my way to cancel the planet fitness membership  i do have some of the new workouts that i already posted...
this doesn t look that much different from your average marvel movie or naughty dog title. hell  i think most of this game s writters used to work at naughty dog. the problem is people supported mediocre entertainment for more than 2 decades and this is what they get.
these writers must live such a lame existence
are we sure this game isn t being made for the ps2  and yes  atrocious dialogue.
a 2023 game that looks like it came from 2003
blows my mind how this game ever got green-lit  especially coming from the same team  same engine as ffxv  which took them years after release just to turn it into a decent game.   the demo for forspoken was a mess  it was laggy  buggy and full of 3rd grader dialogue. i personally expected this game to atleast get delayed 6-12 months after that monstrosity of a demo.  everything about this game feels like square enix threw darts at a board full of what they probably believed would make a great game for western audiences but without actually trying to create a coherent game  woke talking points  diversity  female protag  marvel movie level dialogue  copy pasta mechanics from nearly every popular open world game but just worse halfassed. after about 8 hours i literally felt like i was playing a worse version of skyrim  but with parkour. nothing really improved from the demo  and i dont see this game getting the same treatment ffxv got.
it s been 4 games from them i played that are total garbage... and it wasn t forspoken  i know it was garbage... i was waiting to see if i was right... not disapointed because i was right. i m truly scare about ff16...
as a lifelong new yorker  this game offends me  lol
a good japanese western like game is dragon s dogma. it was a great game no wokist or femanazi input i think.anyway what do i know  i am probably the most racist transphobic  mysoginst person i know according to the game companies
the environment looks great but the character herself looks off
the graphics look so outdated  i find it hard to believe this is a new game.
the dialogue sounds like a tween on a disney or nick show.
reddit tier writing is something i m going to use more often to describe media
13 22. it was going ok until you started talking about the tr reboot... that wasn t a  strong female character  lol. it was completely unrealistic  a 40kg woman can t fight big soldiers  it s the milla jovovich charlie s angels fantasy fights. can t believe people still crave for that crap. the new one is much more realistic  the character can t fight everyone  get s hurt and it has human proportions now thankfully. don t get me wrong i played the first tomb raider when it came in the 90 s and it was the best thing ever but things change  they progress.also  i understand you don t like the game for some reason  but calling for a flop without even playing it  people worked on this  they deserve a little respect. i personally wouldn t make a video with that title.
hey at least u can play silent hill 2 remake.
@watchmehope6560     yeah
when it comes to people overusing the word  woke  i m not gonna be taking them seriously  as far as terrible dialogue   if i can get through tidus and yuna  ha ha ha  i can definitely get through whatever this game throws at me.what i wanna hear is more about the gameplay and visuals. and plain open world is a valid complaint in my opinion.
ps2 had better looking games than this  artistically atleast.
this game sounds like it was written to make that character a modern  feminist snowflake  thinks she doesn t need a man for anything while ignoring the guy stuck in her head. that s a solid pass from me.
reason  51849 to play more retro games.
well  if you don t like shitty writing  jrpgs are really not a good example to follow. they re known for childish  cringy  and campy scripts. tbf  western writers were for years absolutely superior in that department. what changed is the fact that they now hire writers for all the wrong reasons  and it shows - both in gaming and television.
i don t see what is wrong with the lines in the clip itself. for me it s the lack of facial expression and possibly how the lines are being delivered
at this point  i won t be surprised if we get a duke nukem reboot that makes duke nukem a feminist  fighting against misogynistic aliens.
the dialogue is... passable. certainly not the worst dialogue a game has had... but i m all for a silent protag. hell  even a full game with no voice acting is fine. like  this dialogue compared to dragon s dogma where they get heavily accented french voice actors to talk in janky  olde  english... this game s dialogue is passable. it s modern and not setting any bars high  but it s also not the worst thing in the world. like borderlands  but with less energy...
the character is so annoying through the end. she thinks she is being a hero while acting more victimize than the people who welcomed her and treat them like their are nothing because she just wants to find a way to go back in ny so she can live as a homeless criminal.
i m as conservative as they come  but the amount of this game is too woke and cringey seems unfair.  the protagonist is a teenager  she s supposed to sound like a self-absorbed ignoramus.  i played the demo  it s fantastic!  brings back all that nostalgia from when i was a teenager playing final fantasy games for the first time.  people are being overly critical because we ve become worn-out and pessimistic adults with all the bullshit going on the world right now.  jumping into a younger version of ourselves in a dope isekai is probably exactly what we all need right now.  and from what i ve experienced in the demo  it s woke-free.  black protagonist  when the rest of the cast is all white  doesn t equate to wokeism.  i hate shoehorning and checklists as much as the next person  but that s not what s happening here.hell  squareenix has been getting hounded by the left over this game over the last year for  not doing a black person correctly  and other garbage.  we should be supporting it!
i thought this would be bad from the moment i saw the gameplay footage... its even worse than i expected.. identity politics seems to have been the main focus.  was hoping maybe it would be neat for my daughters  but no.
i don t understand the comment of delacroix and how you lash out on journalist at the end. he expresses the opposite. reread this   regrettably  frey s identity is thinly written and awkardly deployed  as the story leans not only on stereotypical narratives but trauma as a plot device . sophia narwitz commented about devs  urges to make this about stereotypically suffering black people and quoted journo as support for her point.
the textures all look flat and smooth with no depth  the speech animations are way off  a lot like a sock puppet  hair looks like straw. the smooth textures like stone and metal look good. they made the low quality textures dark to hide it. body details like face  mouth  teeth  and eyes seem to be from 1999. the teeth look grey and have no definition what so ever. the eyebrows at the beginning look like they run up at an angle to the temple  but in the gameplay footage i saw they look horizontal.  if i was to guess  i would say it is likely the character was the last detail they worked on. the body movements such as running and jumping are repetitive. wind only affects grass  and clouds leave no shadow. it might be worth playing after modders fix all the crappy textures and hopefully the dialog. the lack of actual textures for the skin make her look like plastic  they could have easily used a skin texture that would have looked more natural. perhaps they rushed it to launch  hopefully they fix all the basic stuff like the textures.
forget the dialog is this being released on xbox 360
don t feed your ai dialogue bots endless mcu scripts and then expect it to spew out anything other than shallow snark.
she moved shit with her mind   i had a bowel movement while clearing my mind from this shit
as a person who happens to be a poc games like final fantasy created my love for games. this game is so cringe it hurts. give me a persona 3 any day or a ff9 or 10.
i cant even   look . are we are really looking for video games to have masterful writing !  honestly  you followed the voice actor herself just off the fact shes gorgeous  no further substance than thatbut think we are supposed to credit you for an indepth critique on the script !  fyi  im blackplayed this game.. loved the representation aspecti beat the game- fre kicked major ass. had decent developmentand you dont want to be judged for a horrendous take  saying this whole game sucked only because the writing  as if multiple reasons to play a game do not exist.if you cant get passed the writing  weird but ok.but to say the game sucked soley based off the writing is laughablehowever  not surprising coming from the type who says  hey let me follow this person because they are very pretty its ridiculous and shallow
melonie what are your thoughts on kingdom hearts as a series
i m gen z and i can assure you  the dialogue made me cringe. first time seeing the game  i was excited for it. now  i d rather hold my money in my wallet.
anyone else getting she hulk flashbacks
i mean  what can you say   yosuke matsuda is a boomer and boomers are out of touch. have you seen his new year s letter talking about nft   well  he s tripling down on it and think it s good for gamers and the industry. i mean  it s not good for either of them  it s only good for his pocket and his company though. square enix is dying. it s not going out of business soon but it s bleeding heavily. it s recent games aren t performing well. most of them got like 60 to 70 in review scores and it s live service games are shutting down left and right  for example ff7 first soldier  marvel s avengers and ofc babylon s fall. i think the best course of action is to fire yosuke matsuda and hire someone else that do a better job than him  like in touch with reality  at the very least.
this game looks like it could be fun...but the dialogue is worse than a kr grinder mmo.
and this game is  70 base price on pc.
the protagonist s pride is a huge turnoff for me   if i dislike the protagonist  hard pass.
the dialogue is literally the only reason i won t get it  she was just unlikable and it was painful to hear her talk  and as an rpg liking the main character is important
hell let loose looks better  and it s a ww2 shooter.
reminds me of the cringe saint row reboot. is she fighting demons to pay off her student loans and hella stop global warming  and it wont stop there. be prepared for every land to be run by a queen and some old lady female blacksmiths. that main character design says to me one thing that they put diversity on the idea board before everything else. if it felt natural than ok but it doesnt feel natural it feels like politics and im out by default. i wonder what wokies would think if they knew that in india there is a huge market for bleach products that make the skin look lighter because they consider darker skin less attractive  that would prob make their heads implode.
idk writing you showed wasn t that bad u never played two worlds lol not playing for spoken either
i had worse with tlou part 2  and survived the bad writing. if forspoken s gameplay and combat are good  and i can skip cutscenes  which i usually do   i can deal with it.
that grayson morley guy looks exactly like what i imagine a woke dude looking like.
i was so happy to see an original ip with a brown girl. i m not woke  but i am black. i want to see minorities in leading roles being badass. i want to go to a holloween party and not have people say  oh you re black batman  nice . but not blackwashing   not token characters  filling in  for og white characters.this looked really cool. dialogue ruined it for sure. i could barley listen to that 30 second clip. how am i going to play a 30  hour story. especially when you know it s going to have random banter in the field.
i mean they are still releasing ff16  a new octopath  ff14 is still gaining subs  etc.  so square enix will be fine.  that said  this game always seemed bad.  it s game play looks bad and generic  it s characters look bad  it s initial teaser years ago was insanely vague  every new thing i have seen about it for months screamed  this game is going to be ass   and it s pc specs declare  we didn t even bother trying to properly optimize this game .  it was always going to be trash.also to agree  yeah  they never focused on the main character being black  or even female.  the  school girl gets sucked into fantasy world  is actually kind of a trope in japan.
to be fair  i also cringe at the voice acting  during those ads for japanese games.
the tombraider reboot made lara a psychopathic murderer masquerading as a defenseless girl. yelling  why are you making me do this  as she buries a pick axe into a man s skull and puts a shot gun barrel to his chin and proceeds to make it rain brain giblets...
her face looks exactly like it does in real lifeat least with the tooth gap lol
a lot of dialogue in video games  movies and tv are written with the gen z  gen x method of speech in mind. it is most irritating  broken  loud  obnoxious  inconsistent  self obsessed  and damn right ear bleeding. the way a person speaks is a huge indicator as to the quality of their character.
how does se make one of the best black characters ever  barret from ff7 ff7r  then turn around and make this mess of a character. everything is trash  the animations  backgrounds  voice direction  motion capture  and writing. and no  it doesn t get better  leaks have been all over 4chan for days. se needs to get its shit together.
talk about the success of the last of us tv show.
i hate woke shit    i m not trying to defend se  but if i was transported to a magical world with only a sentient cuff to talk to  i would  far too much so that i knew i wasn t insane. i d be having panic attacks.   if i suddenly killed a dragon with spells i d react the same way. i m gonna play it because i liked the demo    i wanna test out what luminous can do outside of ff15   but what i don t like is the judge is black   the cops are white   all the men are gone   its just woke propaganda. i want to support amy hennig who helped write this  because legacy of kain is my favorite series  but she needs a better job. i m sure it ll be a waste of money  but i don t have much else to play rn. i was really looking forward to this too. ugghhhhhh idk. i did have fun with the demo. but i don t wanna be told i m evil cuz i m a white male in a game i payed for
why would they do this
this was one of my most anticipated games of 2023. until the demo that is. the main character seems unlikable and cringe. terrible writing and the demo sealed the deal for me looks terrible. main character is like a young teen in her rebellious stage  everything sucks i hate the world  so bad. i will just wait for feb. 10th and hogwarts. witcher 3 as normal for now.
she was a defenseless girl who was forced to kill to survive and then evolved throughout the trilogy. what are you talking about
@kdb349  i m talking about a character that never grew into lara croft and stayed an unsure of herself killing machine that committed multiple brutal homicides through the entire trilogy solely because she had to shoot a guy once. the disparity between gameplay mechanics and storyline was palpable. the inclusion of ultra violent finishing moves  while fun  didn t quite fit the narrative they were trying to craft. lara is an adventurer and loves the thrill of finding ancient artifacts through challenging tombs. the further they move away from that characterization the worse it gets.this bastardization of oliver queens  origin on an island transposed onto lara doesn t work and is exacerbated by the following sequels.my hope is they go back to exploration being the main point and action being the footnote in tombraider again.
really  you think so i seen plenty of smooth talking dirtbags  they re usually politicians.i d say that makes you a prime target for crooks because you d fall for their sweetly spoken lies.if nothing else all the cursing in this game actually makes me like that characters as people hate on the game and i hate on the game too but haven t been hating on the main character  other than the awful animations and quality or lack thereof
that s some jar-jar binks level of obnoxiousness. i can take it from some annoying sidekick  but from a main character  noooo... no thank you.
right now fire emblem engage is out. and that is allot of fun.
i know it s terrible  but you being mad about this gives me hope for the future. lol i m sorry you have to suffer for our salvation.
i think ps5 dunk
i would have preferred se make another kingdom hearts pre-half-abridged sequal-spinoff than whatever this garbage that was approved.
when they first announced this  and i saw the character  i cringed. not  because she is black  but because the vast majority of all female  and especially black  female leads in shows and games recently have been incredibly badly written. they don t know how to write women  nor do they know how to write people who aren t white. it s always the same tropes  the same personalities  the same idiocy.the fact that she had a pseudo problem haircut didn t encourage me either. it s an indication of lazy writing  and a highly politicized creative process.means the game is gonna suck.
that looks like a sims version of her. with no custom content.
i think the game is great. everyone is a fucking critic because they think their shit don t stink.
genuinely atrocious writing. what always gets me about cringe dialogue like that is the amount of people it had to go through who all said  yeah it s great let s go with it! no wonder western media is in the toilet.
it s a jrpg with traditional cringe dialogue. it s based off the japanese anime isekai genre and its tropes. watch any isekai anime and you will understand what this game is. it s not a western rpg just like dark souls isn t a western rpg. it just has the look associated with western games.
played the demo.  not only is the main character obnoxious  self-centered and a downright terrible human being.  the controls are bad.  like really bad.  you can t move the camera while flying.  like. the one thing that you would absolutely need while flying  you cant do.  the combat controls are counter intuitive  and the ability menus are difficult to navigate while doing anything other than standing still.  just a terrible game all around.  i notice that all the recent trailers have removed all in game dialog  which is funny as hell.  even the marketing team was like  yeah  no one is buying this game if we let people hear this crap.
watched some gameplay this morning  it honestly doesn t look great at all.i m sure there s a lot more wrong things with the game  i pity all the people that preordered and gonna buy it on release.
this teenage-millennial joss wheadon-speak was cute for like one season of buffy. 30 years later it needs to be put down and buried deep.
forwoken is forbroken.  and soon to be forgotten.
ive seen videos of the game and everything on it looks boring  there is no iconic style  there is no effor in making the world special and unique  even skyrim has more iconic personality. like if you show me a thousand random gaming images and one of them is skyrim i would reconise it in a blink of an eye. its like a fantasy world created by someone who has only made modern day settings. you know what  it feels like those newer assasins creed games in terms of world design were all its made to look   realistic   but then you trow some   magical   shenanigans and there fantasy world.
not only is the dialogue awful but the facial animations are as well. this game is a skip  going all in hogwarts legacy.
why does this game feel more like saints row than saints row....
the robotic animation in that twitter clip makes it look even worse.
now the telegram bots are after me... help.
the devs need more time or are inexperienced. the writers don t care about this generic story. it s all about money  let s not kid ourselves. people will still buy this sht. content creators will make money off videos on  criticism review . perpetual cycle. everyone loses. everyone wins.
this is what happens  when you remove all classical hwite writers  from school curriculum.
well  duh  the demo was a dead giveaway
uhm am i watching ms. marvel 2.0
forspoken is awesome!!!!!!!!
i noped out on forspoken the moment i heard the main character speak. otherwise it might have been a game i d want to play. bad move  square enix.
total isekai ....but i think this video creator doesn t even know what an isekai is lol  my only issue with it was it wasn t optimized properly
more like forwoken.
hell yea dude !!!!
well glad i m not the only one cringing over this just started play and i literally can t keep up with story skipping everything already it s so fake that it comes painful i just wanna blast some shit
forget the dialogue  the flying f k is that gesture  2 28
i moved my mouse with my hand.....i moved my mouse with my hand.......i.....moved my mouse......with my hand...........i moved my mouse with my friggining hand!!!
it still looks like a ps3 game
0 06 --   drops tomorrow . don t you mean  flops tomorrow   xd
..and  they  said elden ring open world is empty..
thats what you get squeenix for involving west crapp in your games.
i honestly think a lot of why the dialog s bad is because ella balinska s just not that good of an actress. we didn t like her in resident evil either  not saying the cancellation is her fault  but it s just meh
this is gen z type of humor just look at tiktok
can we use japanese voice overs   i don t know japanese. at least that way i can pretend they are saying something cool.
it s 2023 we can t  have curvy   hot women because reasons...i know   it has be a reflection our modern society which means no curvy   hot women    extremely handsome men in our society that s bad and sexist and everything that end ism.
also the pc requirement is so high
honesty... i want square enix and their nfts to flop hard!they have to learn the hard way so they go back to make premium games.
they re now an esg company. way way worst.
exactly!! the best way to appeal to westerners is waifus!!  waifus for everyone  ass kicking waifus  damisels in distress waifus  hell even traps!.
square enix needs to just do a remake of parasite eve 1 and 2 and chill. they are destroying the company. people thought they had that in the pipeline and it turned out to be some dumbass nft stuff. who is running the company -_- they need to take some notes from capcom and go back to their roots.
she should talk to her hand when she talks. seeing her talking to no one is just weird.
this makes old dubbed kung fu movies look bad lol
don t tell me this game was written by disney or netflix writters. and the game is so unoptimized  so chunky but the quality doesn t even compensate or justify the system requirements.
square enix s velma
capcom is all w s lately and square has been l s for last 10 yrs imo.
the second advertisements mention the protagonist s race or gender that s when i nope out
i agree  thats a pretty horribly done face scan  it s not even as good as gamecube.
why does this look like a ps2 game
it s getting trashed everywhere already.  i hated what i saw from the beginning. the mc design looks terrible.  but the dialogue is so so so so so bad.  i don t want to play a game having to listen to that cringe the whole time.  square is missing the mark more and more with each game.  i m already getting ads from other vendors selling it for 20  off.  i think square already knows it has a stinker.i really hope ffxvi turns out ok.
her facial expressions are so stiff in that video game cutscene.
the facial animation is cursed.
the demo had so many eye roll moments as to induce vertigo. the lead actress was horribly miscast  and none of the dialogue seems genuine. the cuff guy tries  but the writing isn t there. spending 50 hours with these characters sounds torturous.
this is what some would call woke identity politics trash
i m afraid for ff7 remake parts 2 and 3. this is all square enix.
the character model graphics looks like she s from playstation 2.
no they need to take notes from falcom that is their roots the legend of heroes series is better than anything they have made in the last 15 years capcom isn t good at all they just keep remaking resident evil
literally nobody talks the way they do
pretty melonie square enix  trying to make a succesful new ip but still failing and forspoken  i dont know if the problems comes from the character or the gameplay or the graphycs or everything definitely too bad i like many square enix  games rrom the past yet lately it looks like marvel these days.
mel i love your accent
square enix didn t make forspoken. they only published it. ff7 remake will be fine
give us back tomb raider and take back forspoken.
i honestly thought she was a native american character in 80 s 90 s attire  looked like my mother when she was a teenager  only now learning she was black  the dialogue felt forced and cringe  as a man who favors the  y this was too much.
thats just sad.
the character is literally she-hulk...another stereotyped copy-pasted  strong woman
i suggest to play on ps5. pc still isn t ready. maybe my name is in the credit  maybe it isn t.
i love square enix but i m sad they did a game like this final fantasy and kingdom hearts are so popular i don t see the point in branching out so far from games they are good at making. they can make other games but they should stick with the formula that people love
it s so weird these people that claim to be the most enlightened also glom onto every stereotype and trope about people based on skin color.  it s like oh the protagonist doesn t like basketball wtf!  this is all wrong!!
square went crazy woke so i hope they go down the drain
she reminds me of mrs. marvel from marvel s avengers ..... that is not a good thing
been saying this game was going to suck a
even characters outfit looks so blan
that looks like late ps2 graphics. like ffx
welp not buying this at full price. i ll wait for the discount.
i love the game
i don t get the woke angle  but squares writing has been really bad and bland for a while. i think this was their attempt at changing that a little but it didn t really work out. i won t even be playing the new ff.it s probably gonna be a 7 10  but for 70 that s..not ideal..
first  a joke  forspoken  more like notspoken. that or quiet  please. now for the serious  square enix is out of ideas  they ve admitted as much themselves. years ago there was an interview with i forget who that basically stated that you will know when they re out of ideas when they start remaking games like ff 7. well .
at risk of sounding  boomer-ish   im more like genx   its sad to see such ..crap.. from companies i grew up with  seeing most of the things i grew up with getting rekt.they just seemed to  care  more about everything  making better products  innovation  stories that really connected  that were fun and imaginative..producers of goods and entertainment seemed to care about the quality of what they produced.. now its just sjw woke reboots or regurgitated puke with mind-control as the main theme...well the mind control was always there  but ppl used to resist and recognize it  so they had to  scale  it over time..for example movies  watching t2 and the matrix new in theaters way back thinking how awesome movies would be in the future...only to realize that  that time back then was pretty much the peak..ok rant over..b4 i spiral off into many odd directions..as i tend to.
for real...the character looks kinda ok..the menu  layout is dreadfull..the writing..ehh if it was  better then it could carry the game..if it was better then even the empty world wouldnt be a problem..the game looks like it was made for someone other than gamers.. i get than for a female character nails and  clothes could be important..but for real...they could make a more advanced equipment system...diadems  shirts  even boots...not only nails a cloak..ehh..i get the feeling that they want to feminize players..
she was in the resident evil show on netflix and her character was absolutely terrible but she is pretty
another babysitting  sim   isn t the last of us cr4p enough
if ign says it s bad and it s real bad
this is what the japanese think we like.
everyones talking about the writing but what are those facial animations  big new gen game looking like it came out on the 360
can someone tell me how many female mercenary were in ancient greece  ac odyssey.
you look like the main character. you must be a red flag
i didn t even know this was a square enix game. it just looks like they let a bunch of wierdos from the west handle this one. i hope they learned from this mistake
more front mission
i swear i thought that this was a new film with bad dialogue. i should have known better....sometimes the characters you play as are better if they had their mouths kept shut.....
ok we kinda started off on the wrong foot  you re kinda cute so i ll actually subscribe and try listening to you
honestly sony should refuse to sell this thing for any more than 20 dollars
anothgame i won t play. thanks  that saved me some money
they used  gnarly  unironically. no more comments about my regular  unironic use of  cool  and  groovy.  now get off my lawn.
i played the demo. it seemed ok but it was too easy. the writing  from when i saw other gamers  let s plays  is absolutely terrible. such a shame.
i was just watching theradbrad playthrough and was thinking the same thing! the dialogue is horrendous
i saw the ending and it doesn t get better.spoiler warningshe doesn t go home  and one of the final scenes shows her cat wondering where she is. i feel sorry for kitty  the only good part of the game
it s deliberate. the face model for jill valentine  was farmore attractive than her in game character.crapcom said  they do this because their  strong wemen   need to look strong..... like a dude....this time  it looks like they didnt even bother with mocape....guess they wanted to budget this time...i know it s a different company... but they all act the same.
and just like this they are missing lines of dialog for aleksios   me.
get woke. go broke. i hope this game flops harder than the marlin i reeled in last year.
its young bloody all over again
there s reason capcoms  appeal to the west campaign  crashed and burned don t do square enix  stick to your guns do what you do best
did they reuse the dragon age graphics  cussing clowns!
the dialog was bad when they first showed the teaser.....
i like the profile pic update
infamous was a really good game  eh
forspoken  more like too much spoken . seriously  i played 5 minutes worth of the demo when it came out and shut it off after the tutorial cuz the dialogue was so irritating.  as i said elsewhere  it feels like people twice my age wrote a wb script for people more than half my age.  hello fellow students!  that being said  i ve seen most people who got review copies say the same thing about the dialogue. apparently the gameplay isn t much better.
mass effect andromeda lookin  a lot better now
yea idk why they would ever outsource the writing to the west. bad move. look at comics vs manga. that s all the evidence anyone needs.
the west doesn t know wtf it likes or even what it is...square enix...dont change for this lunny place
i watched a play through of the game and said to myself.......yeah this game isn t that good   and i was gonna get it because it looked fun but what they was saying was yeah
its so bad.....omg shes a negative bish in the game......plus she said she couldn t buy good cat food.. then 5mins later she has a bag of money hide in her room..... so ridiculous........then the fire she could of picked up the bag of money......before saving the cat........the writing is so stupid..........you re 100  right
copyright strike what are you talkin about somebody just did the whole game part 1 and then they re going to finish the rest later the dialogue is bad people rather dealwith a mortal kombat reference which i m waiting for
that dialog is like a very  very bad dubbed of an anime.
oh my god i really people moan it about the dialogue in this game it s not that bad it s not amazing but id hardly make a video complaining about it
does anyone even use the word   gnarly  anymore especially a teenager
uh  why does that look like a ps2 game
more than the  chatgpt script   who did that ps2 cgi face mocap and body movement mocap  anyone could do something better on unreal engine 5  it was as easy as using unreal engine 5 with all the graphic and it would look amazing  but no  they used cheap 3d engine  as if they want to launch that game on switch or something.
yes!
@meloniemacgoboom  you know it s good when hacks try to do the same thing 10yrs later and it s nowhere near value of the original.
when square enix try to be westerner focus audiences  modern audience  they failed horribly  the only se games that still success are final fantasy 7 remake  ff14  nier automata  remember that the actress is the same as the character from resident evil netflix that also failed
that dialogue was similar to kamala khan from marvel avengers but worse in my opinion.
uncanny valley.
the graphics look really really buggy look like something out of the xbox 360 era
lmao i completely forgot i even played that. all i can remember is the dope muscle car picture that one dude had and wishing there was something that connected the story to the rest of the me universe.
nope  sorry but forspoken smells like 2020 teen spirit since day one  or at least since the e3  or game awards   world premiere  trailer release...
i ve watched more gameplay....it get s worse and i m not just saying that to dunk on this game. combat alone will make you want to play on mute  for example every attack you do she says some cringe stuff on top of overly done grunting and yelling. it s just so bad and i would say that this game would  work   saying that lightly  with younger kids but she curses like a sailor and in the worst way possible.
this game is weird lol
wait til the gurlpowa side starts claiming people hate the game because mc is buhlack.
don t forget to drink more liters of water .
the writting is laughable but the graphics looks like playstation 2 level. are we sure this is not the same dev team that did saint woke reboot
the elden ring voice lines and stuff wasn t great. too little  too cryptic  etc. if it was an amazing game in general the voice lines wouldn t matter as much.
not sure if this game was made by ai or californian npcs.
i was gonna buy it... but after those first cool trailers  the textual advertising in the west became  we have a black woman main character  ... like guys  we freaking saw you don t have to tell us over and again.  also i hope they call me racist being black and all  then that demo was just.. butt
i initially thought this looked good  but the dialogue and character have been a big turn-off for me. i strongly dislike this snarky  cringeworthy style of dialogue where characters constantly make these sarcastic self-aware quips and try to sound as unlikeable as possible.maybe it ll be more tolerable if i change the dialogue to japanese.
forwoken
the facial animations look worse than andromeda
love you
sony needs to but square asap
forspoken   more like unspoken cuz nobody will mention this game after a week
looks like an old ps2 character.
i was interested in this at first but the more they showed  the less i liked it. pretty glad we got a demo for this so i could see that not even the combat was gonna make it work for me. they can call me racist if they want but i really hate the main character. the cringe is unbearable.
nah i hate  direct japanese translations they come off stunted and stupid.however you still need properly done dialogue and clearly forespoken is not it.
final fantasy only. everything else can kick rocks
is not about being western  is about the heroine talking like some cringe tik-tok  teen. who wants to listen to that all the time while playing.
the problem with this game is it a bad game.
weeb 4 life
i won t be buying forspoken i m just waiting for dragon quest iii hd-2d remake
lol squarenix obviously didn t learn anything from capcom s donte may cringe
something taken out of context  that maybe if people play the game could find the character portrait normal  but i do agree that square enix should just focus on jrpg and  asian  centric games. the hate its just unjustified but then its a black women mc  with some cringe lines dialog  on a very bad optimized pc version and a playstation exclusive all the recipe for the haters to take advantage of it. it is what it is...
when a generic incel from a modern isekai anime is more likeable you know things went beyond wrong.
is this saints row dlc
did they get this dialog from the writers of the netflix resident evil series  so cringe.
i noticed this when i played the demo.she has no facial expressions whatsoever.which turned me off of the game.
she looks like she s on a green screen. it s just looks weird.
go onto your steam and hit the ignored buttom
boom.
i cant stand this style of humor when they drag a bad joke for a loooong time hoping to make it better
yup  this is all due to hiring people with gender study degrees! i was interested in this game but not anymore!
forwoken
that dialogue was too long  but more than that  it was arrogant. frey sounds insufferably arrogant  and something tells me she s not going to get any comeuppance.
bro... ppl tripping off the dialogue... like really what s really got ppl mad
the main character sounds like she is from she-hulk or some other sjw  modern marvel crap
this girl ruined resident evil  now she is working her way into video games. they only used her because she is what they think the modern audience wants.
... the bad dialogue. the actress is actually smoking hot irl
@jon snowden  at the end of the day.. it s just a game within a game... no one is pressuring or forcing ppl to buy it. if it disappointed you simply leave it at that
one more thing... they do this  for the views  drama grabs attention
@mrsolodolovyb3zz  i am not into pre-sale buying of any games anymore. cyberpunk 2077 assured that.
if companies want soe different  but interesting culture  they could look at europe medieval. or europe aroung 200 bc was far more interesting than most people think. or rome around that time. or the near eastern world during the persian empire. or greek around 400 bc. babylon a bit before. arabia. before that egypt was incredible. and before that  it was creta. a highly developed culture. the first using bronze. making swords out of that. pirates. egypt had to suffer.in asia around the year 0 china was huge. they invented the crossbow and the modern mass production. they made the crossbows out of parts with certain standards  so you could just exchange them. so you could use the same arrows. they had units with 3 people  2 - 3 crossbows. one shooter  one loader  one gave arrows. they could fire every few seconds  at least 600 ft  200 meters far. so if you have enemies with meele weapons  there is no chance  if you fire every few seconds  and they have to walk 200 meters. if you have a huge army  fire and advance. it was modern. running 200 meters  600 ft in light armor  with weapons should take at least 40 seconds. would be around 12 miles per hour. so around 19 km h. and it wasn t on a road. they could shoot at least 5 arrows in this time  so they were able to conquer a huge empire. it was logistics that made it fail. not a single enemy. huge borders  messages needing a long time to arrive where they were needed. after they were weakned  afer hundreds of years  the mongols easily took over. so a lot like rome.but standard components in europe came after 1850  especially for weapons. and middle american civs were incredible. what they found in the 1500 s was just a shadow. cities huge like rome during the best time. up to 1 million people. i am just thinking about themes  what you could base a game or story on. even if it s post-apocalyptic  it could be based on something from the past. because a lot of stuff they take over are more like cowboy adventure  guns  rifles  pistols. but with tombs. or it s post apocalyptic  but something like wild west style.and if companies would like to develop something really new  instead of making another version of what they took over  there would be a lot of options. dark souls did an incredible job. one of the examples is the claymore sword. it s not just exactly how it looked like  especially the pommel and handle  you can even tell  it s an earlies version. it s probably from before it was really popular  before 1500. it was a bit heavier and bigger than later versions. 2x the weight. not something like a medieval longsword  but pretty close. it s just an example of great research. another thing is balder s armor. because if you look at the stats  they fit the myth of the ancient god balder and how he was. and it s not a lot known about him.imo all of this  all the knowledge and inspiration is out there. and you probably could say  it s inclusive  because it shows and respects other civs from other parts of the world. but otherwise  they consider everything cultural appropriation. but doesn t matter  it s just a lot of inspiration they could get  if they want to develop new games. especially now  because if it s about all of that  the research happened something like the past 50 years. not like f.e. egypt  that was in the late 1800 s. so now there is material  that wasn t there a few years ago. and now  you have the technique to research very easy a lot of stuff they found out recently. it doesn t take a long time anymore until the average person hears about something new  something bigger they found out. i would love to see far more games based on different things. not just cowboys and guns  rome or knights  but even that without how the culture really was
i like my black people in games victimized. -soy boy gaming juro  probably
borderlands 3 ava 2.0
wow!
uh  yeah  no. i m good. too much cringe for this man.
it s bad isn t almost sadly so   almost
it s sad the actress is so beautiful  charming and can do well acting  but she s just has been in crappy projects  this game and the awful resident evil netflix . she needs to fire her agent asap.
im terrified spider man 2 is gonna pull some anti white shit for miles morales
dialogue sounds like a copypasta from the mcu.
i purposely don t watch interviews with devs of tombraider simply because i do enjoy the game very much  if i see their interviews ill be reminded of why they actually put those political elements into the game rather than it actually feel natural because lets face it some bad men do say and do bad things to women and its not so over the top that its unplayable... don t get me wrong i hate modern 3rd wave feminism and women can be just as bad as men if not worse in some cases however there is an element of realism in tombraider and when you don t watch the devs talk feminism bullshit it mostly seems natural.
remember mystic quest
geez  that face texture looks really bad. it looks like a ps3 game. it looks lifeless. square has been failing upwards for a while. they ve been tripling down on nfts and other garbage. they keep making live service games and about a year later they close them.
i hated the free demo.
sigh...    i m getting current marvel movie vibes...
seems like all console games are taking a crap
12 02
they have to keep using the racism card  they have to keep beating that drum
why do girls like half-wear their jumpers    i always found it really strange
written and voice acted by tumblr girls who watch too much cw.
sony became successful with its japanese stuff  remember ffvii  they need to stop this woke nonsense or theu will go down
yeah i wasted  64 on ps a few days ago and this is definitely one of the worst games i have ever bought as melonie says it makes one  annoyed  and is cringe worthy and just eff ing terrible so square what ever are not getting my support. i used to enjoy the odd trglad i had my old directors cut of death standing to finish off.
weebs - we love  japanese!
i have already played the demo on my ps5. is not that good. have no soul.
squeenix needs to go bankrupt
wait everyone s is bitching about the  square words  or how the character is.
why is square enix getting worse
good god! that was extra corny!!! you weren t lying! man that was doo doo through and through. that was aggravating as hell to listen to!
the dialogue is bad the protagonist insults her mentor. in the game.
annnnd yet another game imma skip. good to know
gnarly   people still say  gnarly
squareenix been dropping the ball a lot lately.  from doing a collab with tiktok  influencer  addison rae and now this garbage. ff16 isn t impressing me either. i miss the days of squaresoft.
the cringe acting and lines made me lose a braincell.
am i the only one who thinks it all looks artificial  the graphics are ugly  face expressions and some textures  and the characters feel to be reading their speeches   also  totally agree  j games gotta stick to j stuff! i don t even like western games that much.
is this the same actress that was in resident evil  and was just the absolute worst there too
god that first dialog is so annoying now everyone outside the us think we amaicans repeat that same words and not understand anything around us
that shit looks like it belongs on ps3
1 play the demo...ps5s graphics look nothing like that clip... 2 the games theme for that is she is a muggle stepping into a magical world and taking on etherial bogeys... the game itself is basically a third person shooter with magic and spells as projectiles...not worth full price but like acg said  buy it at a discount...watch his review..youll get the jest. that clip in the vid is garbage  looked like 1080 that was downscaled by the uploader.
jeez is it taboo to say the word  american  in gaming
sorry but i called this a year ago. i said the game looked boring and cringe and it seems i was right.
they re focusing on the dialogue which to me is far from the worst aspect of the game.performance  visuals  presentation  bland everything else is the problem.granted i grew up with people who cursed a lot so and so did i but i knew that about myself and of course only did it when around those people who also did  so her being alone and saying s  t 3 times in a row is nothing to me.
@factshurtu  i mighty this game went it on sale.
the pretentiousness of dialog from that game is abominable. you d have to enjoy sitting on something large and horrifically painful made out or chainsaws to also enjoy listening to that game dialog.
wow that game is so childish  its like a 13yo s perspective of  being tough .
she s a beautiful beautiful woman .. looks at picture  looks at melonie not by comparison  no. she s... meh looking.she s attractive  but not beautiful beautiful.and definitely not gorgeous.
forcewoken flopped  what a surprise...
westernized rpg that thinks woke is western culturei call that insult
lmao
currently playing and yeah the dialogue and facial animations are bad but combat is decent.they havent said anything about race but there is an overwhelming amount of women so far.
i don t think it s the writing completely. the acting is  bad . it could be saved with much better acting. but  the lines really don t help.
ive seen some gameplay  the dialog is terrible. i seriously cant get past it.
forwoken was dead from the start
square enix got no class.no class!!!!!
if this video game character didn t vote for  joe biden. then she ain t black!
kfc hire...
what who why ps5 what you doing !!!  0 you guys got a ps 5 and you got this game i feel bad for you guys sony are for real !!!!
this is not next gen.
i simply had zero desire to play as this protagonist.  her story didn t appeal to me at all.  there was way too much poorly-written dialogue telling me a story that i found to be completely uninspiring.
wow this is what they they that how black women talk like
woke nonsense will be the death of games just like comics and movies
i dont know  it wasnt that bad. who cares
what i m hearing  good gameplay  shit story.so come for gameplay  skip all cutscenes... that s kinda sad  when square used to make good stories.
i think it looks good but the problem is when you buy the product not knowing what your getting these days has people worried with the games just make a good multiplayer game.....don t worry about lame story i can t believe i m saying this but if you can t do a good story with characters that don t sound like naive teens stereotypes. this isn t just lame this is insulting why make this  are young people this naive just buying anything
they spent all their money on nfts.....square enix president should be fired.
doa
the tomb raider survivor trilogy looked good and so did final fantasy 7 remake and kingdom hearts 3. how could square publish a game that looks this terrible
why does the character model look so out of place  it looks downgraded compared to the environment
ah  yes  it s good to see reactionaries also hate something ordinary people hate for once.
i m part of gen z  and i find that  dialogue  annoying.
floorspoken is garbagesqueenix needs to go back into bankruptcy again anyway so let the cards fall for them
forget the cringey dialogue. fallout 4 looks better with 20  of the download size of forspoken.
the demo wasn t that good. there s barely any review codes making the rounds. early footage of the game has been super-cringe.yeah...it s gonna be a  20 title in a few weeks. or ps plus premium.
wow that clip was cringe .i was thinking about getting the game  but nope. hard pass.
stronk wahmen doesn t need men!
i tried the demo. the gameplay was jank af. the game feels like it needs a full year more of development  because it is an unpolished mess. leaving aside all the ridiculous politics and bad dialogue or whatever  the game itself doesn t play well. it s not fun. that s it.
it looked boring from the original trailer. nothing since has changed my mind.
not great...the trailer is kinda meh. doesn t mean there won t be better highlights. but yeah  i ll be skipping it  too.
flopspoken
we all know why this game will flop. modern gaming has been invaded by politics from both sides. i ve seen so many game reviewers want to hate this before they even got it. pathetic. follow the leader sheep.
is it me or graphics look like shit  i mean at least on pc the specs where very demanding  i know that this is from a ps5 version probably  but i guess the difference between both versions will not vary that much.
another disappointment
leaks  horrible demo  cringey dialogue and one of the most baffling cameras made this a flop in advance. reviews were the cherry on top.
sleeeeeeeep
omg  that game sounded like garbage lol. so stunning... bahhhhahahaaa! geez. she don t need no man  even though there s a man s voice in her head. wtf  this is a hard pass. il wait for hw legacy. thx...wow that was bad.
might actually be the voice acting too..  in japanese its half as cringe to listen to
wait wait wait  what s the problem with the dialogue i promise you y all are overreating and ruining your game experience over dialoguesi don t care if i offend anyone y all in the west are destroying your entertainment  just enjoy the game  i honestly did not see anything wrong with the dialogue  someone did magic for the first time and defeated a beast  then her confidence went to the roof  bro  i can actually imagine someone do that
that clip was the very definition of cringe.
people talk about genz like we are some hive mind its annoying as hell i didn t even know this game was coming out.and after seeing this i m not even remotely interested.
one last thing. the game play looks like a rip off of bayonetta.
love you
dude... they made kingdom hearts. fucking kingdom hearts. what happened in the writing department
i saw the first trailer for this game and never thought more of it... it loooked like shit just like anthem looked like shit despite people trying to tell me otherwise
hate forspoken  simp for ella.
this reminds me of that crap avengers game.
everyone s trying to copy marvel s style of dialogue
ngl i played the demo and it was so baaad
lmao it looks like a cheap tie-in game to some hollywood flick. even when you mute it  that design is so bland. pretty sure that s not her final look but that hair and outfit makes her look like an npc in spider-man.
doesn t help that the game looks like a mid lvl ps3 game.
obnoxious and annoying sums it up perfectly.
i was fine until gnarly and mangled. ita cringe but not terrible. if the gameplay works then its forgivable.
what time period is this set in  this ain t clever and smart like buffy.
i never saw the hype behind this. it looked stupid from the first trailer.
wokeness
not allowed to look beautiful in woke video games. sexy is totally out of the question. could be why playstation is dead in japan. sony has gotten so woke  japan doesn t want them there.
every project i ve seen her in is bad
empowered female character of color and empowerment and femaleness. i m tired  boss.
this dialog is just pure cringe!
i immediately dislike this character.i can immediately see how that scene would be improved with a custom silent protagonist and the voice telling them what s up.
should have focused on remakes like chrono trigger parasite eve drakengard 3 etc. and it will do 100 times better than this crap flopspoken
everything about this game reads flop in the making.
uuh this dialogues are so cringe ! who is in the right mind write this
square enix is a shell company now.  nobody there besides yoshi p knows how to make a game.  the only success they have is from milking final fantasy 7 which is something created by someone that doesn t even work there anymore as a one off project in 1997.
ohmnon non no
honestly after the demo i m not feeling like buying it. gameplay was not very enjoyable for me. slow and clunky.
the writing is worse than listening to youtube kids.
dude because black doge pe pe black
playing with muted audtio is not fun. pass
bad dialouge aside  whats going on with her mouth  so serious uncanny valley going on.
and the game did flop lol
hey you re jealous this game
this sounds like it s going to be like borderlands 3. i love the gameply  but the story is obnoxious garbage and i couldn t play bl 3 because of it
omg it s so bad  the character model is so bad.. the mounth is not even following the dialogue and the scripts is crap.... i don t understand why ff7r is taking so long when they put   and ressources is being diverted to make this kind of crap.
don t get me started on how a certain type that talk too much.
didn t like this game from the announcement so i m happy to see it crash and burn
this game looked terrible from the original announcement trailer.
glad someone else said this  i cannot stand listening to her speak  the actress seems to be in so much that is kinda poor. resident evil ahem  but damn it so hard to listen too i just cannot. its an easy pass for me.
the dialogue gets worse. and the game looks like a ps3 game.
i do not think the dialogue is all that bad actually. sorry. you may mock the everlasting crap out of me now hehe.
i can get passed the dialogue but the facial animations are extremely stiff. the mpcs are probably the worst.
how is the horizon games in existance and square enix came up with this to pander to americans
the game looked like shit in the trailer and it looks like shite now. how anyone could have been excited for this game just baffles me
she also talks like she s got braces or a mouth guard in her mouth. it s so weird but the writing is beyond cringey!
a game that makes fun of isakai games and makes fun of the east media trope.... well least we got black representation lol  also it looks like something that came from ps3. i mean nier and capcom does better. with face scans
all the racist having a ball with this game
i can t get over how bad her teeth look  lol
@te.legram_me_meloniemacgo  lol thanks but i am far too lazy. i do like you for the record
the demo was bad. i stopped playing it after like 25mins. it s not gonna be good.
now watch final fantasy 16 get high ratings we are not getting no more new ips from square enix anymore because people are cry babies all we going to see is the same old stuff over and over and over again thank you casuals that don t play games just talk about it
bullshit
oh look another reviewer using the same clip using the same descriptive words as literally every other reviewer.
cringy dialogue  720p performance mode  rarely holds 60 fps and can dip to below 30 fps  costs 70 dollars. hard pass
its why they made the main character black  as a fallback easy defense.
that tattoo  please women don t do that stuff...most guys don t find them  cool  or attractive
japanese writters trying to imitate failed american entertainment is not a good idea at all.people love japanese story telling more than they like american current crap.
esg.
@normanreaddis  environmental  social  and governance..............fuckin hell
@kingtai64  yep
@normanreaddis  we need want something like horizon but with better weapons instead square listens to idiots and normie weirdos and we get forspoken. dude we re so fucked.
look at the wikipedia page. all the writers are western
wow  those graphics are seriously disappointing. swtor has better graphics and its 11 years old. what the heck  lol.
ok terrible game. way to go square enix  4 games in a row they have screwed up.
i m glad to see the flop - it s not bad enough the graphics are meh   using luminous engine ...give it up guy change to unreal 5   now cringe dialogue - yea no thanks
don t do western style. but also don t overdo the anime waifu shit
what an odious protagonist. big miss.
this game is a big failure  for sure square enix just burns itself with this  and  the next final fantasy will be a big fail for sure too  western stuff is not good anymore  the japanese devs must needs to follow their  own idiosyncrasies in their games and media  and  not mimic our western horrible modern media formula. please japan don t mimic us  we like the classic japanese style on videogames.
cringe asf  when will the cringe end  .
another flop for square enix.
sounds like a liberal wrote the dialogue.because repeating the sane point more than once by the same character is annoying.
i was planning on buying that game  i did not know that we would be forced to play as that most annoying obnoxious girl.  yeah im out.
stop complaining about the dialogue. just turn it off on put it in japanese if u don t like it. ugh.
literally trying to copy mcu dialog.
i mean... honestly other than the last bit of dialog... if you just got powers you d be pretty geeked... and prob sound lame as fuck too.
only square enix games i play are the final fantasy series. outside of final fantasy i can t stand anime or anime games. they re cringe.
oh...that looks bad along with the horrible writing.
you re so pretty..
well its not a shock.. forspoken screams political agendas and woke.. i didn t even look at anything after the trailer.. i personally will not be buying it.
nah dude this is for sure millennial humor. avengers shit
just wondering if the character are as annoying and obnoxious as those in borderlands 3.  horrible dialog.
game looks like ps3 skyrim square enix needs to stop pandering to the western audience and stick to what there good a jrpg i love the weeby japanese there among my favourite games
forspoken looks like a horrible game and the demo was not fun. i ll pass on this one
now compare this trainwreck of a game to the lovely world of the horizon series... in all aspects.
well if anyone knows what it s like to be a black person  it s a white game journalist.
you complain too much
the demo was horrible. wouldn t waste my money
wow ! this is melonie worst take since the last of us video.
the actor for the protagonist is so so horrible
everything about this game screams cringe  first time i saw this game i knew this will flop. square-enix get your shit together and make some real games again
dialogue body animation are as bad as final fantasy xiv
let it crash and burn. everything i ve seen  has been utterly dismal and lackluster at the best of times....
i called it long before you made this video . the dialogue is cringey   the game is boring.
righteous anger  melonie show  square enix  how lame this game is.
another squeenix flop. who d uv thunk
the game looked good but then i played the demo. it was horrible.she talks too much. the things she says is just nonsense.there s a big difference between her and spiderman. spiderman quips is funny and hers is not.
it looks like a ps3 game... and the main character is despiseable
i have 100  all three new tomb raiders. sounds like you haven t played them. they do not do that with lara. it isn t aww she s a girl feel bad. ahahahaha
terrible dialog and subpar blurry graphics. i ve seen better looking games on the xbox 360 and ps3. this needs at least another year in the oven.
cringe  i hate western dialog in japanese games  especially ones aimed at the western audience.
go woke go broke. main character is   open world is bland and empty. graphics are a leap backwards from ff15
wowwww so cringe. yikes.
ps5 bad
bruh it sounds so cringe
meh... the game looks like trash. i m going back to playing ghostwire tokyo.
the talking lines are cringe
all non-fromsoft japanese games are trash
the face animation is bad too
comments seem honest  hate the game because it has a black female leading character.
not buying. this horizon wannabe but extremely bad
no offense but looking at your content  you didn t seemingly like last of us that much  you don t seem to really like anything  don t know why i get conservative vibes from you  could be me.
there s not a lot of black main protagonists in games at all lol nor anime and the opening of the game the protagonist is in court for grand larceny lol
looks horrible
2nd worst dialogue i ve heard recently. worst is the super cringey script in the quarry.
cringiest writing ever. like 99  of the writing in film school
i m done with benefit of the doubt. i see some non-white and wahmen  i m out. it s just easier and cheaper at this point.
forspoken to me comes across as it s trying too hard to be cool and hip  trying to appeal to the modern netflix audience. too much talking and personality  which is typical with american movies and shows. just cringe writing and humor.
it sucks to say but every time you see a female lead nowadays you can expect wokeness  especially if its a black female. wokies have absolutely ruined gaming.
who writes this stuff  so bad..
looks awful.  more games to laugh at.  woke trash
