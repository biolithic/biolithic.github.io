you hit the nail on the head when you were talking about them wanting to replace the   old and outdated  characters and stories with their own. its not just marvel either  Ive noticed it with other forms of entertainment as well. Ive noticed it happen especially with reboots  thats why they are rebooting everything they can get their hands on. if any of you still watch tv  you might notice that over the years they  have been slowly weeding out the older movies  especially the ones with  issues  and replacing them with the reboots. I believe that their agenda is to  fix  the movies of the past by making reboots  inserting whatever bs message they want to put in there  and like you said make people forget about the old  problematic  movies. I think the long and short of it is that they think they know what s best for their  modern audiences  and if you even question them about it then you are verbally attacked.
my aunt is a former high up executive for paramount  jj trek era    disney  nightmare before Christmas era  and I can confirm they look down upon fans and people who like the product they think of us as children.
marvel would rather be hiring activist with gender studies degrees to write their shows and movies.
as a non-american who has worked in the storytelling industry  I haven t since the panny  it is quite depressing to see this continuing to happen. until recently working in the us was an ambition of mine  but seeing the current narcissistic  if we cant have it we ll take it from you  relationship the us media industry is having with great stories I find myself having to rethink my long-term life goals and the future of storytelling.
they dont like hiring fans but they want our money. fans need to stop giving money.
I remember the first time I saw the silent hill movie  the first one  and I kind of hated it for how much was changed and questioned   why   but then a few years down the line I learned that  if memory serves me correctly  the director was apparently a huge fan of the games and wanted to make as authentic a film as possible to the source material. so I rewatched the film with a different mindset and was able to see that while a ton of things were indeed changed  there was an immense amount of fan service and details thrown in that were used to great effect. scenes ripped directly from the game  set pieces that were absolutely true to form  creature designs and their functions such as the nurses responding to light  stuff like that. he wasn t lying that he was a fan and itshowed. I still dont love that movie  but that was at least an actual attempt at making a game to film adaptation that was different  but still pretty faithful. if mainstream entertainment is so obsessed with changing things all the time  could they at least hire people that actually... y know... care  the fact that they blatantly admit  almost proudly  that they dont is... so confusing  depressing  and just plain sad.
hasbro also does the same. they wont hire for the most part  fans of ips. so the lack in toy design shows. also  hasbro is basically disney
self sabotage is hollywoods new fetish
love the girl. good to hear someone thinking straight... and damn it is sad they are killing every franchise out there...
mcu stans   but they talk about the comics during interviews!  they know things about them!marvel comics fans   so does anyone with an internet connection.
that producer is basically a decepticon who identifies as an autobot.
I dont mind when something is adapted into a different tone  as long as it remains faithful to the source material.  for example  ridley scott s  alien  vs james cameron s  aliens .  tonally very different  but both fantastic  and james cameron made it feel like it fit in the universe.  most importantly  ripley still felt like the same character in both movies.thatsaid  I liked thor  ragnarok.  they loosened up on thor a bit  and made him more jokey  and while it was a change for him  I didnt hate it.  I could see maybe him picking up some mannerisms from interacting with people on midgard   and that would make sense that he might not be so  shakespearian  as you stated.heres where I have a problem with the characters being changed.  when a character rises to popularity or prominence based on their past works  and then they re completely changed  but given the same name  its effectively a bait and switch.  this isnt the character you were presented with and they arent what made them rise to fame in the first place.  its a knockoff.  by changing what made that character interesting  and then presenting it as the original  its just insulting to the fans that made that character popular.people have pulled guns on mcdonalds workers for adding the wrong condiment on their burger.  but they rewrite a character s backstory  gender race-swap and accuse the fans of being  insert  term -ist   fuck off.
of course they dont want to hire fans  fans know the source material and can point out all the places they are getting it wrong meanwhile marvel only wants to use the names of the characters then completely make up the rest to push whatever message is popular this week.sounds like we need to stop giving them money till these people get their ass fired.
and nobody was surprised  lol. amazon and netflix are clearly doing it too and I can already tell the new willow will be the same.great video melonie and have a wonderful day. edit  what is this  melonie left the sleeves on her t-shirt   Im stunned
makes sense  they dont want anyone calling them out on their bullshit.
kinda weird that feige would go along with that ideal  when bryan singer had to same policy during his x-men movies. he even went so far as to ban x-men comics on set but feige would sneak hugh jackman stacks of the wolverine comics so he d have some clue as to who he was playing.
what you said about  their ultimate goal  is spot on!! they want us to forget and or instill into small children what they want our children to agree with. what do they want them to agree with  you know that answer. there are people who will defend amazon and disney to the grave!!
that may be why cavil has had such a hard time  he s an actual geek.
for fans of the original source material whether it be games  comics  or heck even toys for that matter and when we want it to be as close and true to the source material as possible they usually call us regressive  racist  homophobic  this  that  and the other and companies buy into this hard and try to appear to a larger demographic and do everything they canto alienate the longtime fans of those franchises which is a slap in the face to the ones who supported them for all those years.
clearest sign that they really hate fans  no
which just makes me want to watch the older ones more. good job  media.
change always comes eventually  but some things dont require such unless done properly and faithfully. not especially in this day and age where the older stuff seems to age better and have much better appeal than anything new. this  modern audience  thingy is pure nonsense since lots of things from the past remain relevant even today.

def not just marvel.  see also dr who from here in the uk
and for that reason I haven t watched a movie in theaters in years  and when I watch movies  they re generally older movies
what s weird is that even the creators who say they like the original stories and characters dont really like them at all. they may say they love star wars but they actually hate it. they hate that luke was a white man  so they had to fix it by making the main characters diverse. they hate Lord of the rings because the characters look white and male and heterosexual.
what s their rationale for that conclusion  perceived  whining  whatever happened to the customer s always right  if they actually sat and looked at the success any of the  fandom menace  youtubers itshould occur to them that there s actually logical arguments  right
100  - I always hated how producers can easily hijack an industry  that they have no real personal connection to  and then treat the fans like inferior cash cows.
@clay its extreme ivory tower arrogance. they went to an expensive school and you didn t. they make millions. you dont. its a big club and we ain t in it  she s an aunt through marriage and we were the poors who  barged  into the family
marvel was good when they were just marvel  as soon they were sold to disney everything went down hill.
the same with wb. they scoffed at the idea of cw tv actors reprising their roles in their oh so precious movies. they even look down on animation and the original comics.
yeah thatsounds good

just innovate the storytelling in your own country.
@gabriel kirabo muwanguzImugabi  the majority of content watched in my country is made in the united states. that aside  storytelling is universal  or should be  and as I said it was my ambition as us programming has larger reach and thus larger working budgets. in my country budgets are small and thus there is a lot of churn which limits how much can be done. but  yes  I can still work to improve my craft locally.
just keep at it. dont stop!there may be an incredible bias currently in the industry for  woke  everything  where you cant even create a new fantasy world with the characters you want without people complaining   but wait  why doesnt your fantasy world have enough black characters  asian characters  middle-eastern characters  your fantasy realm seems woefully unpopulated with eastern-pacific indian representation. if its an actual good story  just keep at it. keep working it  keep refining it. maybe you could do a graphic novel comic book series first  to test it out. who knows  maybe one day it does get picked up by big hollywood.  then you ll definitely have to deal with them bastardizing your core concept! but until then  keep at it! keep fighting the good fight  against bad  overplayed storytelling tropes!
@the large hardon collider  what wait... have you been to my pitch meetings  xd
@the large hardon collider  damn right!
facts
the only good thing about this era is how much damage it has done to brand loyalty.
sailing the high seas  buying second hand  purchase ticket to movie x but walk into theater for movie y .all ways to stick it to them all.
qed
there are people who just want to turn off their brain and watch something with cgI and explosions in it. they will go watch it. and in the end  disney cares more about making money than bringing out a good product. lets face it  the disney renaissance period ended decades ago. this is the dark age of the mouse.
we do and we should stop but some people have addictions and they struggle to fight them!
oh thats a relevant. you should go see the movie if you want to see it if you dont like it or you dont I think you ll like it from the trailer or what you hear or reviews then dont go see it. but a lot of people still like the movies. the most people who say we shouldn t give money to disney aren t actually marvel or comic book fans. I dont like the direction we ve been going for the past year for the reason  comic book movies are so good its almost entirely because of disney. infinity war and endgame were amazing spider-man no way home is really been the only one Ive liked since then  but that was one of the greatest movie experiences Ive ever had if not the best. dont come across as ungrateful though. and dont call yourself a fan if youre someone who thinks infinity  war and endgame  we re not worth giving your money to and not the best thing a comic book movie could possibly be because if you are somebody who did not think those were good  or looked down on those type of movies  then dont tell people not to get their money  but movies  cause you just like something totally different
@rambleon07  and again Im criticizing disney because I dont like the quality of the shows  especially in some of the movies I was really excited for. we re very disappointing outside of spider-man but the brand loyalty exist because of disney. if you guys deny that youre just anti-disney no matter what they do. they didn t start the mcu  but they definitely did something really great with the mcu and they employ kevin foggy even if they didn t find him first. a disproportionately amazing amount of mcu films exist because of disney especially if you exclude the last year were they pumped out like 50 projects  and most of them were disappointing. they are partially disappointing to the high standard. they said with so many great movies.
@water faucet  so you are buying a film ticket for a different movie then going to see disney marvel  why are you going to see the movies if you dont like them  lol why are you trying to stick it to them just to stick it to them if you like the movies to go see them over other movies  I dont understand that.
but but... the message and social justice reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
lucky for you the same director is working on the new movie that was announced.
kinda like what they did to halo  too. one of the most recognized musical cues in video game history  and it was deliberately not used.
I actually really liked the first silent hill film.  tbf  I didn t actually play the games beforehand.  yet even when I watched different playthroughs of the original games  you can see while the story plotline isn t the same  the core concepts  scenes  and motivations were maintained in the movie. at the end of the day  it truly achieved a great  horrorific  theme that even many original horror movies cant do themselves.back in the day of renting dvds  I loaned that dvd to my grandpa after I watched it. and he told me itscared him so bad he couldn t even sleep that night.
what was hasbro s last original success  nerf  gen 1 transformers were japanese imports. d d and magic were a buyout. power rangers and mlp are 40 year old licensed ips. haslabs is overpriced rehashes of 40 year old ips...
you think hasbro would have learned after the brony phenomenon.
I wouldn t be surprised if the next transformers movie they make optimus voiced by a black gay actor
@mexicanus prime  aslong as peter cullen is alive they will use him coz they know if they didnt they d lose viewers but once he retires or dies then who knows
@henry gambles  or some people like the movies and just disagree with you lol again Ive been very disappointed with everything except for spider-man no way home. I thought thor and doctor strange two were good movies  just very disappointing for what I expected and not something I really want to see again.
@jesse  the comics were better. and they ruined the comics division. they specifically fed on the pre-existing brand loyalty of marvel and utilized pre-disney storylines in order to make their cookie cutter movies. only a couple of the movies were truly good and thatseems to have been in spite of disney.
@jesse  bro doctor strange and thor were shit! enjoy them if you want but objectively their narratives are the worst amongst the msheu with only she hulk being worse! also why give money to a corporation that hates you
@jesse  I should have put a qualifier on that part. I have to sometimes write reviews for my friends website. when Imust watch certain known trash  then I do everything I canto make sure the company does not get any money for their trash.
@jesse  im sorry  jesse. but I dont think you are in a position to tell me how I feel about movies. if you loved them  thats great! you can enjoy more stuff! I grew up reading comic books and consider myself a fan. and yes  being a fan  I cantell you I loved infinity war and did not enjoy endgame. for me  disney went into an awful tangent and ruined everything I held dear as a child. as a fan  I reserve the right to decide who I give my money to. I stopped watching anything disney put out after captain marvel simply because of bad faith.
you know  it reminds me also of allen iverson s career in the nba. after mj s second retirement in 1998  aI was the most popular player in the league in the 2000s  but the nba organization  referees hated his guts. david stern especially from day one  because he brought hip hop in the nba. he thought allen iverson was a bad example  even though he and the league made a boatload of money off aI s back.
its just downright and direct disrespect to all audiences now. its astounding
indeed
if you consider this  thinking straight  Im not sure what to tell you. she rambles her way through every video and this little fringe community of sniveling neckbeards eats it up
@fclefjefff  advice  if youre not sure what to tell then dont. or stupid things will come out.
mcu shills   but  but feigI always said.....
they talk about it  but they dont know squat about them. just look at taika waititI and jessica gao.
so  he s sideways
you have the best comment
and also tell them when changing something from the source material  said changes need to make sense for the medium  story  characters and universe.
damn right
@j turner  yes indeed
exactly  what happened to him after 2018
@j turner  thats the million dollar question  my brother
@evandizasterous  that it is.
feigI also turned woke.
@j turner  he sold his soul. simple as that. now he s just another one of them. too bad.
they dont even try to appeal to larger demographics anymore. they try appealing to specific demographics.
I am just not one for wanting the exact same story redone a million times. everyone hates seeing the waynes be shot a bunch of times so I dont get the hate some of the more obsessive fans have for things being different at all.
companies and entertainment media always consider us fans of comic book  japanimation and video games as nerds. look at how the media is mad at paramount since they decided to re-design sonic back in 2019.
as long as the twitter mob gets fed their ritual sacrifice
@chandler burse  I get what your saying but without the waynes getting shot you have not batman same as if you have no uncle ben getting shot you have no spiderman those events are the prime motivation for our heroes if this is getting boring then thatshould really be a sign that they have redone the story to many times in to short a timeframe and should probably not make a film about that character for a while but thats just my take on it or atleast if your not gonna show it you should atleast mention it
thats why stopped watching marvel and dc productions  they ruined a lot of stuff from comics  but even some new comics have started to have the same problems
based on the state of the mcu I d say it actually makes perfect sense
as eric july says  respect the canon
Im fine with changes in adaptations  but you still have to understand what makes the original media good in the first place to be able to change things
I hope you had a wonderful birthday yesterday  melonie!
you d think marvel would notice their decline is related to the rejection of fandom and going full politics  especially when japan is there bieng massively successful due to embracing its fans and in truth having creators who are huge nerds into the same things as the rest of us
when adapting one medium into another  the biggest gift you can ever be given is an actor director that is willing to deep dive into that world. they dont even need to be fans  they just have to want to go deep into what the fans like about it. to deliberately not do that or allow it is fraud. these people aren t making what people like. they re using a popular name to sell their invariably crappy product.
hey mel hope your birthday was good   your absolutely right you cantell now from everything that gets done its all about the cash cow and not the content
I think it would be a good idea to have a mix of comic knowledgeable people and newbies because the  you get those in the know and those with fresh ideas.
bellonI I love you trying to pronounce the peoples names. I love it when you bring up tomb raider good video melonie. love ya. take care and have a good day.
the way things are nowadays in the creative entertainment space is such a far cry from when people in general used to pay more respect to the source material  regardless of what the ip was.if you think back to the original x-men movie  by dir. bryan singer  the one that launched hugh jackman into stardom   a fella named tyler mane played sabretooth.  in the dvd bonus section  mane goes into detail on how much prep he did for his character.  he speaks with pride on how much studying he did  devouring a stack of x-men comic books  and sitting down with his son to watch the saturday morning x-men cartoon  picking the young lad s brain about the lore of the show  on which the boy was an expert.  that kind of dedication and respect is sorely lacking from today s actors  writers  and producers.
good morning melonie.  really love watching youre  videos and learning about it and getting awesome information about what I  didn t know about tv show and other stuff Ive seen.   you have a wonderful day
let me put it this way  I am not a fan of the twilight saga. however  if I were put in charge of a remake for those films  the first thing I would do is reach out to stephanie myer and or actual fans as consultants. then  I would try to collaborate to see if we can make a version of the movies that aren t so easy for people to make fun of or lambaste while also not alienating the fans that came before.based on what Ive heard about recent marvel stuff  they re not making much of an effort to hire people who show even that much respect.
wait  are you telling me they hire people who have no love or knowledge of the characters or stories we have come to love over multiple decades  even generations nooooooo  I never would have guessed based on  well everything  they  have done and produced in the last ten years at least.
Ive been saying this for a long time about media not specifically marvel but in general. thanks melonie keep making more videos keep fighting and again happy birthday.
all  if not most  these big name brands have been infiltrated and subverted by activists who care nothing for the source material and the fans. its been time to accept this  move on  and support the up and coming creators. no one says you cant still enjoy marvel  dc  star wars  etc but I betting its the old  classic stuff from these ips that you still love. enjoy it  and for the creative types  use it as inspiration to make your thing
as much inspiration Ive received over the years from my childhood and teens from marvel and dc  it is no longer the case because the corruptive perversion has gone on for far too long.  when a comic sells me propaganda or at the very least a social commentary message without actually providing a strong philosophy or narrative  it no longer is a comic book to me.  its radicalised homework. and I ll have no part in it anymore.  Ive taken it upon myself to seriously apply more artistic pressure and creativity than ever before for my ideas and Ive been working on them constantly over the last month  having left behind retail management to pursue a passion of mine that I hope one day surpasses the joke that is overhyped comic books and comic-book style movies.  its a dead language thatserves as much use as latin nowadays and its distorting a much-needed fan base more than ever.  children and youngsters need philosophies and inspirations to look up to  not be twisted by propagandistic agendas.marvel   dc  much like eric july  Im taking you over.  youre corrupt practices and wasteful diversity hires wont save you from creative bankruptcy.  you are a dying star and its time some other folks who have compelling storylines and characters in mind have their day in the sun.  exitstage left and excelsior
so they really are doing it on purpose. after yesterdays mario  we should really star questioning every change we re seeing now. Im happy I threw my idea out there and it was noticed because a lot of what s going on just seems stupid.
nate moore    hiring marvel fans as writers for marvel movies and shows is a red flag for me.  also nate moore   let s hire a former ss c-camp guard to work in a synagogue s day care program!
not only are they not hiring fans itseems they are hiring people who outright hate the source materiel like with she-hulk
hImelonie I hope you had fantastic birthday yesterday  for sharing another perspective of your opinion  thoughts.Im not surprised they willdestroy everything we loved.takecare melonie
exactly you need to keep the core of the story.
its inevitable to have changes done to the material when moving from one medium to another however changes are only justifiable when they are done to properly adapt the material.changes done for the sake of someone s ego in wanting their own story to be told instead of the original  are and will always be wrong.
you just stated how michael bay makes a living
@rhys lightning  do youremember the tmnt movies  he made them aliens. he was one of the problems.
@nick k   I know hes a problem but he somehow still makes a living out of it
exactly! or better yet people who respect the source material but are open to reinventing the wheel and know how to adapt said material.
@j turner  maybe  reinventing the wheel to much can annoy people. I hated the new  flash  thompson. I never believed for a moment tom holland couldn t kick his ass without super powers.
@albert nada retro  I agree.
@albert nada retro  quite frankly I think tobey maguire could ve also kicked his flash  ass. and andrew garfield looked like he should be so popular that flash is considered a nerd in comparison.
@chandler burse  so you think tobey maguire looked like he could take joe manganiello
@albert nada retro  yes actually that dude kind of felt a bit pathetic looking as flash lol. the way he holds his fists up and says  yeah I wouldn t fight me neither  is a meme for a reason.
@chandler burse  have you ever seen joe manganiello
@albert nada retro  have you ever seen bully maguire
@chandler burse  he s not bully maguire in the movie. he s peter parker. joe manganiello is bigger then some pro wrestlers right now  so he was at least twice the size of toby even then.
@albert nada retro  its a joke dude
@chandler burse  oh  okay  it was well camouflaged  it wasn t funny at all.
@albert nada retro  the fact you came to the defense of some actor I honestly never heard of after those raimI films is its own kind of funny though.
@chandler burse  only to you.
@albert nada retro  dont be so sour.
@chandler burse  Im not sour  your jokes are.
@albert nada retro  you and my jokes are both sour. patchkid.
@chandler burse  actually Im 15 mins away from finishing work. Im rather chipper.
@albert nada retro  more like a woodchipper.
@chandler burse  thats a good name for a wrestler brad  wood chipper  jones.
thats a good idea though. wouldn t fly in hollywood
its just a shame brian singer sidelined him didnt even get to explore his rivalry with wolverine
I would ask stephanie meyer to write a better book first. I always thought of bella as the worst written angsty teenage female character ever  but that was before  50 shades of grey . now she is only the second worst
@viktor vondoom  well  the twilight movies still made a lot of money. so there is an audience. I would simply try to expand upon what good ideas are in there and try to make the characters  including bella  more interesting.why is she so angsty  can Imake her aware of her own issues  maybe make a character arc out of that thats the kind of discussion I would be having with fans meyer in this hypothetical situation.
@dragon sword   my earlier comments does make me look like I would be one of those shifty people who hates the fans then  huh  in that case my revamped answer would be that I would not take this project and leave it to you because I hated the books and the movies and wouldn t be able to do justice to the fans. not saying you liked them  but the fact you found positives in the movie says how much I hated them more than you.
twilight the novels weren t really good themselves either it was just a bit of a obsessed woman writing out her romantic vampiric fantasies. robert pattinson himself said he believed she was mad and thought her world was real.
@chandler burse  never said that I thought they were good. I d probably have to make some major changes to the story in order to feel satisfied. but I would want to keep in mind what drew so many people  mostly women from what Ive heard  to those titles.basically  I would ve liked to make something that old fans could enjoy while  to paraphrase lauren faust  not making new viewers want to shoot themselves.
they hire people who want to see the source material burn  and itshows
we are creating our own original comic book and world. we incorporate elements from mad max  blade runner  x-men and batman.
@havoc faction  Im glad to hear it
I really dont understand their mindset here. why would you deliberately hire people who dont understand comic books  have no idea how to write comic books  and basically have nothing but contempt for comic books and comic book readers  its like the fire department hiring convicted arsonists.
well in fairness lot of superhero films and even video games when they do something different from the source material its not always bad like sam raimI spider-man or early mcu films or even the nolan batman trilogy but to me its just all the woke stuff that completely changed everything. but I still agree with you melonie especially with yeah not everything from the comics or videogames should be a 1 to 1 adaption into films and retelling the same story.
on the dc side of things geoff johns was involved with aquman  wonder woman 1984  shazam!  birds of prey  and justice league pretty sure .  so having more involvement from a credible comic book background doesnt always translate into a successful film or series of films.  I can only imagine how rare and difficult it would be to find a successful marriage of the two industries.  henry cavil and ryan reynolds are a couple that come to mind.
that producer got their priorities backwards if they think hiring writers that have no love for the source material is a smart move.
you might be in luck with lara croft as the next game will apparently try to connect the survivor trilogy with the original games  which one considering legend was a sort of reboot too .
marvel not caring about the fans anymore isn t surprising...
Im so sick of them changing the characters and stories to their liking instead of just sticking to the true source material. something s gotta give eventually. also  you looking particularly stunning in this video for some reason. maybe its the hair up. have a good one melonie mac!
its because they dont want to be limited by what they can create the only problem is they completely lack creativity and talent.
why would they like to hire actual comic book fans   that would actually make sense! they hate the people that they re supposed to be making these things for.
yeah  its bad that they have been doing this but I feel sometimes its good to change a few things for a new spin but you shouldn t change the core of a character. dont really think the changing of stories to some degree is okay  but they really should hire people that have the source material on mind so they have most of it there. reason I feel changes to stories isn t all bad is it allows for some surprises  just wish those that did make these were fans. nonfans have been systematically ruining franchises especially of late. appreciate the video melonie.
what if you tweaked the tone completely  you cant. to tweak something is to change itslightly. completely means the whole thing. you cannot tweak something completely. so  waititImeant change it entirely  and thats what he did.
the message  is really about trying to suck the life and testosterone out of society.  growing up I loved  and still love  the great action films.  the old arnold movies  bruce willis  stallone  old kung fu movies  before the ccp ruined hong kong .  I even watched older movie with danny kay and errol flinn  anything with action.  I wasn t raised that way  I just enjoyed them.  I started reading at a young age and loved fantasy books and went through them faster than my parents and library could keep up.  seeing all these things that I loved ruined by flappy handed  soy drinking   modern audience  sprewing  lgbtblahblah people makes me rage  frenzied  and ultimately sad...
I agree completely - it is sad for the industry and us fans.
yes  there s a translation when transferring story to a different form of media. with video game to movie being the most difficult in my opinion.but  using the source material doesnt weaken the story. it makes itstronger. good examples of this steven spielberg s   jurassic parksam ramI s  spider-manpeter jackson s   Lord of the ringsrob marshall s   memoirs of a geisharobert rodriguez  frank miller s   sin cityzack snyder s   300james cameron s   alita  battle angeljames and the giant peachmost things from tom clancymost things from john grishamsteven spielberg s jaws is almost part of this list.movies that didn t follow the sorcerer material doa   dead or alivedragon ball   evolutionstreet fighter with jean-claude van dammethe lawnmower -manas fan of comics and movies. when the writers gets too adventurous. there is a 25  chance of still being good. but  more often you get 75  of  what did I just watch   or   stop  please stop.no really  you can stop now.  in the end  the movie that uses source material is always gonna be stronger of these two films. all you have to do is look at batman. in the beginning batman wasn t much to look at. but  different writers built upon batman overtime. now  its own universe with dc comics.
I got another theory to posit  the  d d  effect. who were the game of thrones show runners vocal about reaching   the soccer moms.  this is where we see these shows get shaped to target multiple audiences for maximum coverage. cowboy bebop was actually pretty notable for this by taking an involuntarily trans anime character and turning them into an out and proud trans live actor. this improves representation  but they re effectively a completely different character. the only person on the cast that actually survived this conversion was pretty much jet  but thats mostly blind luck that the studio snagged an actor who knew what he was doing.
wow  its like the star wars original trilogy special editions when I saw them in 1997 in theaters. I thought it was neat and fun  at first  until I found out that they would never go back to the real versions! I ll never see thatsega saturn lara croft anytime soon either...
counter argument  having a massive fan of the source material at the helm gave us arguably the best film adaptation ever in the form of the Lord of the rings. so to anyone who buys this excuse  I know a nigerian prince that needs your help with something and is willing to offer a generous compensation.
fans have money  piss them off and they wont spend their money.its a simple equation.
the first tomb raider  and especially the 360 remake  is one of my favorite games ever. the one tomb that had all the greek doors like the one with the swords of damocles hanging from the ceiling was fantastic level design. that being said  I didn t hate the crystal dynamics games or the alicia vikander movie either. kinda wish that those new tomb raider games had more  . tomb raiding.
happy belated birthday melonie!
@rambleon07
@rambleon07  its almost like that vicious older sibling or school bully  tearing out a page from someone s favored book or pulling the arm off someone s favorite doll and saying  haha  look at what I can do!
propaganda is a helluva drug
sam raimI is a die hard silver age spider-man fanboy though. his changes weren t done because he felt the need to change the material. his changes were similar to that of peter jackson s changes to the Lord of the rings  pragmatic changes that are necessary for any adaptation.
the difference is sam raimI is a fan of the source material. yes they know changes need to be made and they ve reinvented put their own spin on the ip  but the core remains the same.
@j turner  true.
@j turner  thats a good point to bring up. marvel has been driving half their audience away with their drastic alterations to the source material. for example  not saying that wakanda forever namor sucks  but they ve changed so much about the character that he isn t the comic book villian at his core. its something that can satisfy mcu stans  but will frustrate everyone else.
@new_guy  but mcu namor does suck.
raimI and nolan are creative people and able to put their vision and created world onto the big screen.  disney has begun to hire directors to simply tick off a box because movies need directors but the fact is that much of the cgI fight scenes and story telling is done before a director even comes onboard so whatever their vision may have been isn t going to come through.  and in some cases where a director does put forward their ideas we get a tonal mess like thor love and thunder.  half of that felt like taika doing his thing and the other half felt like it was set in stone by disney higher ups.
@jon fox  ok fair
they definitely have their priorities backwards.
congratulations youre the lucky winner of the ongoing giveaway text me on telegram to claim your package.
and neither is the irritation we ll feel for filthy casuals touching our stuff haphazardly.
@zettabeam62  facts
exactly  like where s the logic in that   these people have some serious problems
I feel your pain
I could literally destroy them and do jail time for it without no remorse
sorry  as a fan of comics  movies  video games and stories. I had to nerd rage on this one.
lol Im convinced the street fighter movie was adapted from a discarded gI joe script  with van damme as duke and raul julia as a magnificently megalomaniacal cobra commander
lol  I cantotally see that.and might have been good as the first live action gI joe movie.as is  I hope van damme   raul julia and the costume department got paid. because they did their best to save that film. even when it was beyond hope.
muh secondary demographic  has gone from being a nice-to-have bonus to a tyranny. its not enough to capture the people who you know will love this thing  you have to bring in other groups of people  preferably in cash cow demos  too. see  eg  bronies.
jet was race swapped. but then again  all of the characters were race swapped.
@rambleon07  yeah  and he proves race swapping can be fine if the actor can nail the role. in his case though  its more of a credit to the actor s skill than it is to anything the studio did.
I can see the advantage of hiring a person or two that are unfamiliar with the source material so that they can make sure its not a requirement to enjoy the show  but overall the majority should be fans.  I d much prefer they make comic book movies series accurate  yet approachable  to bring in those new fans.  comic books  themselves have kind of fallen off in our culture for different forms of media  but if you can grab those fans to the point where they want to go back and read the original  thats better for everyone.
disney doesnt like hiring marvel fans for marvel series and they ve also had a reluctance to hire star wars fans for star wars stories  fortunately favreau and filonI are exceptions  and amazon doesnt like to hire people who know and understand  and respect  the source material for rings of power and the wheel of time....that would explain a few things and at the same time they want to sell their stuff to the fans of those franchises.thats like getting someone who s clueless about cars to try build a ferrarI and sell it to supercar enthusiasts..
all the people that truly cared and paid attention to the little details either left or were pushed out and replaced. mcu is only gonna get worse.
pardon me but  didn t heath ledger read the prime joker stories going into the dark knight  pretty sure he read at least the killing joke  and then he went on to blow most fans expectations out of the water. even if the story is not pitch perfect to comics  the heart of the character needs to be there.
bold strategy cotton  let s see how it works out for them.
this whole discussion  about being force-fed things we dont want in entertainment  reminds me of the great powerman 5000 song  thats entertainment.
I really dont understand this thinking.  build a huge universe that people love by making comic book movies thatstick pretty darn close to their characters in page  then decide the way forward is to hire writers that will specifically not do that.
marvel considers it a  red flag  if writers know how to write engaging stories. prefers  depressed  flabby social media addicts with tds.  - fixed it.
love your take on woke topics!
disney already said years ago that they wanted to  let the past die ...... and every other entertainment company followed their lead.and now look what they ve done the past few years  all the while blaming the fans for not liking their  work .
anime manga will always be superior.
sonic should be a blueprint for any company with a profitable ip. the first sonic movie sold so well opening weekend that paramount already had a sequel locked in with sega that following monday. sonic frontiers has outsold God of war  ragnorok in the us and uk  source  tailschannel .  unlike the marvel  lucasfilm heads  sega had to listen to fans. fans are the lifeblood of whether the sonic fails probably moreso than other fandoms. seeing sega finally listen after so long and seeing successes for listening is such a breath of fresh air.
yes they dont want to go by the comics these days. also they probably will make an all women avengers eventually. it will get 98  on rotten tomatoes
8 01 nate moore s arugment itself is valid to some degree. but its being used as an excuse to change whatever they want with the source material  even if said changes are a disservice. its a shield from criticism
she actually looks like a real life more beautiful version of lara croft
the problem is that there is a reason these ips are popular. brining in the fans helps bring that factor out. while it isn t impossible to ignore the source material and make a great movie a majority of film writers cannot do it  at least not with how much these movies costs. worse is that they want to insert something extra and unwelcomed when there is a great deal of things cant do or have to do. what we see happening in hollywood is both lack of talent needed for such ambitious projects  and a desire to do what ever they want and get rewarded.I do sympathize with writers who want to have that creative freedom  but in this era of rebooting old ip s being to understand the source material is becoming a required skill.
imagine hiring plumbers who know nothing about plumbing.
these big companies said years ago this is what they were going to do.
I just finished logan again tonight.its clearly a new story  not mark millar s old man logan  which is a wild ride. but  its pretty clear james mangold understood the oml lore and fit it into foxmen s settings.  these losers need to step down so actual comic fans who work in the industry can give us the best versions of the characters.
this kind of thing is why I invoke the  greener grass  fallacy.
agreed 1-2 outliers who are willing to do the research and help build on the foundation of said source material is fine.
exactly the core needs to be untouched.
yes  he did
someone from marvel needed to hear years ago  if it ain t broken  dont fix it

damn right itshould. if they didn t listen to the fans and kept that inital awful sonic design  ugly sonic   the film would have likely been a financial disaster. lucky they did and its paid off wonderfully.
yep  he understood the lore  tones  themes and organiclly fit it into the settings of fox s x-men. the film is a masterpiece  it really is.
its always been obvious to me. I remember watching the first guardians of the galaxy movie and it takes place on xandar yet there s no nova corp and yourealise over time that they dont know their own characters. they could do so much more with this library of characters if they were hiring people with that knowledge.
I d be ok with this if they d hire us to make shows and films about cherished woke topics.  d
disney s she-hulk... nuff said.
I personally think that marvel is doing a great job by bringing these stories to the general audience and giving credibility to these fantasy characters. I was never a fan of comic books but I do recognize some quality in this marvel universe  mostly because they werent so attached to the original source as a canon.I have enjoyed these movies for the most part and not being a fan  and probably thats what they are seeking. comic books fans already have their comics to enjoy  so is a win-win for me.my two cents.
and now its time to buy some gfuel code mac
Im wondering if the terrible writers that destroyed the mcu claimed they were fans to get hired so the executives think the incoherent plots were the product of obsessed fans instead of ignorant outsiders.
I dont get it  the comics is a perfect test for whether the story is good or not. all they have to do is follow the comics and then tweak it a bit if people didn t like it. what s wrong with marvel
off topic but you look very young for someone 36. I think its because you dont drink or smoke and take care of yourself. Ive seen some people your age that dont take care of their body and just look awful.I figure they dont want us fans involved because 1  we might come up with something better and show them up. 2  we aren t woke or pc. 3  if we dont like somebody no matter what race or gender they are its probably because they are a punk and not due to some hidden racism or sexism.
Im more of a fan of norse mythology than I am of thor in comics  so the original 2 movies were enjoyable for me. once I saw thor was becoming a joke in ragnarok  I was already done. they need to just get people who actually fit the position more at this place  the new media is losing fans for them
happy belated birthday  melonie.shout out eric july.
4 00 thing these  I ll be polite  people dont understand is that just because they aren t willing to give fans what they want dosnt mean some other independent isn t going to rise up to fill that gap taking the money they could have been making.and some of these fan made films  comics and games are just as good in not better than the   professional   works.greater  lesser their all evil.
always makes my day to see a new video from melonie!
hit the nail on the head at the end. they know the name will make money cause it is beloved but couldn t give two shits on why its beloved so they use  like the critical drinker said the best  a conveniently large platform to spread a story  thats shitty  they they want to tell. but are too cowardly and creatively bankrupt to make something authentic cause it will flop
love the shirt. that anime is amazing
I just discovered your channel. you are speaking my language
but this approach produced an objectively worse product. your goal is to make something that delights the fans  customers . doing the opposite is crazy
seems to me they dont just want people  out  of the comics mainstream  but people who are hostile and antagonistic towards it. the vandalism attributed to marvel s writers towards the source material is no accident. it was a studio demand.
and this is why I no longer have disney plus and Im not watching the movies in theaters anymore.  hell I have zero plans of buying midnight suns.
as I have said  for years  it was never to tell a different story  it was always to spite the fans of these ips.the do not like the fans  they want to change the fanbase of these ips to people that they want  gay  black they thems
I call it the  multiverse movement.
it would still be on the executives to verify they re actual fans.
probably
I could see this being their scapegoat at first
@lexcore corp  it would be
thank you so much
true but itstill really hurts.
so I can go with the idea of not wanting the writers to just rewrite a story from the comics but isn t that what someone like kevin faggy s job is  or one of his meny assistants   to make sure that the story he has in his head is followed  yes a writer may come forward on a project and go hey Ive got this idea and it may make that line waver a bit but it is still part of a bigger picture that kevin has in his mind.each comic book character has a core that makes them what they are a fan of the comics should know that core and be able to bring that core into the story of the film but that is the problem with hollywood they dont want hero s they want zombies that can be controlled and told what to do  what to like  what to watch and what to eat and drink heck sadly you can replace the word hollywood with the western world now as its most of the us the uk and large chunks of europe
this and halo being all  we hire ppl who hate halo  seems like the mitchell and webb skit where the writer is pitching story ideas to his publisher and publisher is always going  or what if we do the opposite !  over and over.
oh boy!!! this gives me hope.  Im going to write a sh-- screenplay and walk in saying I hate comics so they ll love my sh---y stories and give me money basically for trash.  mwuahaha
hey melonie sure fans know a little more about comics  rather than  modern audience  writers coming from new marvel.
I love how you say  ...   cause Im obsessed  . if you dont mind I .m going to steal that from you
essentially  the producers   people with the funding are straight up disrespecting the creatives that fuel the heart of the industry.
have you seen x men days of future past  95  of the new characters have totally wrong powers and the sentinels  even future ones  never had this kind of powers  the original story is 2 x 24 pages  and they adapt maybe 5  of the story  in the comics its about half in the future and half in the 80s  in the movie its 85  in the 70s and 15  in the future  ...bishop   guy with gun with red energy   most powerful energy absorbing mutant  can use energy blast with hands or guns  and become more physycally strong - gets killed by energy blasts of sentinellssunspot   gets all black and much taller and is super strong  has strange light absorption abilities including limited flight and doing dark energy blasts - flame body and shoots flameskitty pryde   she s phasing through matter  disrupting computers - sends spirit through timewarpath   becomes super tall and strong and resilient - ultra strong hearing and fights with a small kinfehavok   sends destructive white blasts through entire body  nut often with hands - sneds red energy ...
well how many seats canthey buy but not use before recognising their movie failed
I dont think you have to have a perfect knowledge of the source material but you should have a least a basic understanding. winter soldier was more of a spy movie but it was still a good movie. the writers these days aren t writers they re activists.
of course they dont  they cant push  the message!  if they do
halo did this with 343 studios.  hiring people with an opposing view of halo to create a fresh and different perspective   the halo franchise lost more than half of its original player base.
a lot of the people in hollywood hate nerds and geeks....always have.  and a lot of the story writers in comics and games now see their job as an audition for a hollywood gig.
I read this yesterday and was shocked! why would someone want to hire a writer that is a fan  I dont get it and the part in the article when he said  thiers a movie here  a...yeah  but maybe dont change everything and maybe you can make a decent movie
while we were selecting people to design this bridge  if they were an engineer  that was a big red flag. we want someone who s never built a bridge before.

this is literally the same stupidity thatsank 343 and the recent halo games. what a brilliant strategy  cotton!
the only way to stop this is to starve them out financially
there is clearly a logical disconnect at work throughout hollywood. on the one hand  you have the executives who make the financial decisions  they seek to acquire popular franchises because they see the potential to make money by mining the existing fan base. on the other hand  you have the people who make the creative decisions  instead of capitalizing on what made the franchises popular with fans  they reimagine the characters and the settings to suit their own tastes then vilify the fans who object.I can sort of understand the latter group s motivations. its not just that the themes in the source material grate on their woke world view  its also a question of ego and reputation. they want to earn the respect of their peers in the industry  and to do that they feel the need to put their own stamp on the ip. what I dont get are those guys who spent millions of dollars to acquire the ips in the first place. at some point I would expect them to tell the creative people   just shut up and give the fans what they want so we can make more money.
I need a wife like mel
did you stop reading a scripture after your vids. Im new to your channel and the few I watched youread a scripture  I really enjoyed that please keep doing it.
Imean  Christopher nolan hates batman but created a good trilogy. so  even if the people hired are not fans  it does not mean they will not deliver a good product. it has not been happening lately but a not fan could be professional enough to understand and respect the main details themes of an ip. probably....
that is the problem with these comic book movies.  these writers and directors dont get it.  totally out of touch with audiences.
this is nothing new. its certainly older than  woke-ism.  this has been an issue for basically as long as I can remember. in fact  it got much better for a while  but then the long standing studio culture seeped into everything again and caused a return to the old pattern.movie studio executives and producers tend to be businessmen who were never fans of various source materials that they end up making movies from. therefore  they dont understand fans of the source material. they dont take things like comic books and video games seriously at all. they think such things are silly. this thinking that they are silly leads them to believe that nobody could really take them seriously  and thus the movies shouldn t be serious. this thinking can affect any science fiction or fantasy source material to some extent. when you think that   oh  well this cant be serious anyway   you end up with things like street fighter  1994   and thor  love and thunder  2022 . when you think   I have to make a standard movie that will appeal to a certain movie audience  not fans of the comic book   you get stuff like batman  1989  and its sequels. sometimes the  trying to make a good movie out of it  attitude at least ends up as a decent movie  though not very true to the source material.one of the first superhero movies that I saw that made what could be considered necessary changes to things for adaptation to cinema while staying as true as possible to the original material was spider-man  2002 . this was apparently because sam raimI was a big fan of the source material. of course  execs had to get involved by the third movie and ended up destroying his plans for it by demanding that it had to have the venom character included. the reboot of the movies with andrew garfield totally departed from the peter parker character and made him into the cliche  rebellious youth  character  while changing less important aspects of the story to be more like the comic books  like the web shooters .when marvel was its own studio run by people from marvel comics  it produced much better stuff in general than it has produced since it got taken over by disney.of course now you have the  politically correct woke  factor slipping into everything as well  which gives the movie executives another target to meet while continuing to ignore fans of the source material.
thats hollywood for ya!
there s 2 reasons for the writers 1. they lost the culture war of gamergate and comicsgate so they have to work around it via hollywood to get normies to believe this has always been since no one listens to us nerds.2. the writers are too lazy to do the research into the lore of said franchise. having staff and crew listen to fans or know the source material means they cant just write a rough draft without sources and call it a masterpiece.
I think you may be giving them too much credit by saying they want to make the characters and series more  woke   that at least implies they have morals that they want to stand for. no  the plain fact of the matter is that they are pandering to the woke twitter mob because they seem like a huge demographic that needs to be tapped with mainstream media. the reality of course  is that those people have never liked the source material  nor will they actually go see the new material. so they ve alienated the fandom which was for the most part quiet and chill and therefore  small  so they could get the loud and obnoxious  large  twitter demographic  that they will never have anyway. they need to lock the fans in and only then canthey hope that a more mainstream format will get other demographics in. as it is  marvel studios is probably beyond needing the fans at this point  its too large so until the garbage they keep putting out gets to be too much  it ll be self-sustaining.
really cool jujutsu kaisen shirt
let s not hire mathematically inclined people to teach math. they might not be able to think outside the box  even though they established all the success in the field.
they hate that we can make it better than they can.
I d rather see a new adventure  then watch something else. I d rather see the story blown up bigger with better graphics. this is the same  argument  Ive hears about why cartoons never follow their comics and yet somehow anime even if you take into account fillers  can follow the manga and still bet millions of eyes on it despite  we ve already seen thatstory.
its funny that the loyal defenders of the mcu say  it happens in the comics if you google the most popular comics and stories  you get shallow surface-level knowledge and thats what they use as reference.
I wonder if these producers and writers went to confucius institutes. china uncensored did a video on it
Im going to be very blunt here. the reason why they do it  is because they know they have hired complete hacks to write the movies so they want to give them freedom to see if they will be able to make anything good with the property.because they know that their writers will fail miserably if they try to properly adapt the books
and that logic makes absolutely no sense
I liked ragnarock  because of the story  it was a good story. directed  produced  acted  it was in my opinon well done. love an thunder  had a good story  but almost everything about it was trash. I say almost  because the acting by an large was decent  not perfect  but decent.
I hear that netflix is making a gears of war series. another one bites the dust.
nobody melonie  speaking of tomb raider..
there are things to be said for hiring people who are willing to make changes from what has gone before  if for no other reason than some characters are very much products of their time and to introduce them now you would need to change the backstory.  x-men are a good example for that  in the developed world certainly attitudes about race have changed so much since those comics began that you couldn t just start them in the current mcu as is  but would likely have to redo the central conflict of the group or go the doom patrol route of characters with powers which are either too dangerous or mean that they cant live in normal society
chato appearing into meionie s video iike a chad
I dont think Christopher nolan hates batman  but I get youre point.

james gunn s dcu better be good.
do they want brian singer films  because thats how you get brian singer films.also  the only character that was updated properly and was improved from the comics were  luke cage and john walker aka us agent.
well  that explains why they are so out of touch with their own audience. and why they re movies dont make  1 billion each anymore.
Im a normie with most movies based on books comic books and even I see that as a red flag to not be faithful to the source material.my  1 fandom is the donkey kong universe and Ive already seen examples of nintendo seemingly not giving a crap about the franchise  for reasons other than wokeness.
why did you use a still shot from the flick scene in the thumbnail  I thought you didn t like thatscene.
age of ultron   in the comics  black widow and wolverine are sent into the past to prevent hnak pym from creating ultron  wolverine kills hank pym   they get back to the present where ultron dominates the world  absolute thrash comics noone liked and fans tries to forget  - in the movie   well in the present tony strak experiments on the soul stone and creates an evil aI ...

telling us something every blind person saw
kevin feige knows the marvel comics. he s is a comic book fan. thats why marvel changes the stories so they wont be so predictable.
lets reeee reeee do it
my two cents - hollywood believes if movie characters had the same exact experiences  personality  appearance  powers  etc. as in the comics  then the movie will only interest a small niche of loyal fans - that would mean less ticket sales and less profit for the movie. therefore  execs think by hiring directors and writers who are unfamiliar with the original source material will create characters and story lines that would appeal to a broader audience - thus  increasing the profit margin. its kind of the same mentality that movie directors have when whitewashing non-white comic book characters  because they feel a caucasian actor will bring in the audience better than a non-white actor.
really cant get my head around the idea you have to ignore the source material to the extent holywood does.  one of the most successful adaptations recently  which gave amazon one of its biggest hits of 2022 was reacher.  and guess what  its pretty much faithful to the book  and completely ignores all this woke nonsense.could there be a clue here
is this new  well yeah maybe that dude admitted it  but this has been going on since 2010 or so..
the witcher show runner claims with hemsworth it will have an all new energy.   yeah the one person that tried to police them has left.  it was cavill lthat kept me watching through the season two garbage.  even though geralt was nothing more than a traveling plot point for the female stories.
if I was above this  creative  he would be fired as well as everyone he hired.
the fact that they re losing so much money and still continue to do this shows their reasons are entirely political. they re willing to lose money to push their divisive propaganda. its really truly sad that as a species our storytelling culture is moving backwards and getting worse.  due to direct sabotage  now that we have all the technology  we re dealing with the worst written stories and characters  and lack of creativity we ve ever seen since the beginning of cinema
when they had surI as black panther for the sequel  I was actually elated. Imean the movie wasn t great  not even her portrayal as the black panther  but at least they kept it faithful. then again  I dont think we had to worry about the new black panther being anything other than a black female  because every other character they re changing into poc and or female.
this is what appropriation actually looks like. this is what happens when you do not gatekeep.
I loved thor  ragnarok but I do recognize that love and thunder is not as good as ragnarok or og thor was
that explains alot
thor  ragnarok while more goofy then the first 2 thor movies still knew when to take itself seriously  it didn t downplay the overall story like love and thunder did.
hopefully disney replacing the ceo and it changes the way movies and series are produced going forward. and hopefully this has a trickle-down effect on the marvel situation as well as other streaming services and movie studios. this whole woke agenda is a bunch of bs. it has made established franchises that were beloved by the fans become something that people do not want to watch.
batman  the animated series was created and produced by fans of the franchise. disney-marvel avoids letting fans have any input. compare and contrast.
throwing away the original marvel comics source materials  stan lee would have never wanted this! this is an insult to his memory!
I think that the problem is overstated more often than not. thor ragnarok was a solid movie despite the spider-thor bullshit that happened. she-hulk was fine. it was similar to comics that Ive read  and Im honestly tired of people overusing the word  woke  as soon as something isn t made specifically for them.I find it funny that the people that bitch about marvel and its new  woke  status the most  are the same people that thought that no way home was good. it was a bad story with bad dialogue and only survived because of the nostalgia factor. they promised a real spider hunt at the end of far from home  and then it just became a non-issue. the entire movie was like a theme park time travel ride. a bad ride.Im far more worried about the mcu falling apart from horrid cash grabs like that  than I am a few missteps like love and thunder. last I heard  taikI is supposedly not directing another marvel movie after the shitshow that that movie was.its easy enough to recover from a bad movie being that the mcu is so big now. it requires the powers that be to do something about it  like fire waititI s ass  but it can be fixed. poor storytelling that banks on nostalgia and spectacle cant be so easily remedied.
in the tone of a woke hispanic lady  nate moore...naaaaate moooooooore...naaaammooor. namorit means he s a child without love.
chapeck  sp   the last disney  bob  guy  just started a new direction.  maybe he can grab this nate moore guy and take him along as well...  they sound like a good match  along with all the other woke jack wads at disney.  maybe they could all follow the old bob to new pastures.  new bob could follow in a couple weeks.  then they can choose sides  bob vs bob  and have a big 10 year pillow fight in cuba.
its fine if marvel does not like comic fans. as a comic fan  I do not like marvel now  so its all good. I checked out after endgame which I did not like that much and captain marvel which I absolutely hated. have not watched any of the new disney products since.
go boom
why would you hire a fan of something to create things for the fans of something  they will already buy the thing so change the thing to something its not to target a wider audience
this is the 19999 continuity so anything goes and I have no issue with. for now the 616 continuity is safe so again I have no issue.
the same jocks that used to make fun of me back in highschool have taken over the industry that is supposed to deliver this content. no wonder all s going to the gutter  since all they ve ever had is contempt for people like me.but its all gravy  Im an adult now. and I can speak with my wallet.
I find it kind of funny that the two most well received and well rated pieces of media in recent years  game of thrones and house of the dragon  kept pretty tight to the source material  sure got kind of flopped at the end  because  funnily enough  thats when mediocre writers had to step in and finish the story. house of the dragon season 1  fully written backstory  a few tweaks here and there but explained brilliantly  but the core concept and story path were forged by the author himself. you know  the person who wrote the story thatsold however many millions of books   roll into 2022 and we have rings of power that is vastly different from the source material  marvel  movies that are vastly different from the comic themes and what do we get  poor movies that are not well received  there s no bone in my body that doesnt think the recent mcu movies would have grossed way more had they been aimed at the target audience they are designed for. I think thats where hollywood is going wrong lately. they want all of their higher budget movies to reach every demographic  which kills the movie for the demographic that actually wants to see it. Im a white male  I couldn t give two hoots about watching empowered women in a movie about the God of thunder  I want to see the God of thunder! not thundercuck. if I wanted a rom com  she hulk  id go watch sex in the city or something  I d rather see she hulk tearing up a city being a bad ass.
this is where we re at with inner-detainment  why does anyone want to go back   run from hollywood and dont look back.
funny how both cavill and hemsworth seem to have backed out of the woke crap.
reboot inhumanoids cartoon  I dare you hollywood  p
thats why they like prequels and sequels  because they can write out the original and well-loved characters for their crappy replacements.  the tv show gotham was like a batman show...  with no batman.  it was a cheat to try to draw in the batman fans without actually delivering batman.
I understand being mad about hiring people who dont read comics to direct movies but being mad at  woke  ideology is not the problem  if anything it makes you come off as racist
best job  I would work at hollywood and read all the interviews infront of the quoted people - then backhand them with the appropriate level of force equal to their stupidity - hopefully  repeatedly until they are re-educated and or convinced to amend...
people almost always having expectations  why is that bad   you like golf and are looking forward to a world class event and being with like-minded people  but its rained out for the day.  now what to do   looking across the street  the local community centre has a hockey game playing.  there s a crappy idea -- from world class golf to local goofy hockey.  your friend says   thats just a good! they re both sports games .  first of all yourealize your friend is an idiot  and your second thought is that you d rather just go buy beer and sleep in the parking lot and wait for the sun to return tomorrow .... remember expectations.movie producers dont seem to care about our expectations.  they re planning on delivering whatever gives them the most profit  so long as it includes the proper message  and we re just supposed to love it.  we re not allowed to have our own expectations  but have to be subject to theirs.  we re being told that mcdonalds is fine dining  and they expect we re to stupid notice the difference.  sorry  some of us can actually tell the difference.
100 agree
that is so ridiculous. over half of your audience is going to be ingrained in comic book culture. if we see something too far from what we know  we call it out. the spider-man movies have always done well because even as they slightly venture away from the source  we accepted it because so much was still on point an in keeping with what we know.  ultimate universe  earth-616  etc. we watch closely.
I like to listen women against wokeism and agenda telling truths
hImelonie love your content what would you rather play detroit become human or last of us 2 and happy belated birthday
would you hire an electrician who had no experience with electrical systems  would you hope that he would bring a fresh approach to the electrical work so that it would function in a new and different way that no one had ever seen before   probably not.  you want somebody who understands the material they are working with. writers   producers and directors who have no knowledge of the characters they are using cannot properly prepare the character for the screen. marvel s priority now for hiring comics writers is that the person is heavily into feminism  racial justice  and  representation.
marvel producer.... thatsounds like victoria alonso
woooow no wonder marvel has been so bad recently. at this point  Im not sad. Im just disappointed. they have so much potential  but everything nowadays has to be about the  message  or representation. or freaking hidden agendas its just so exhausting. Ive tapped out of disney marvel and haven t cared in a long time. the only thing that marvel has been doing good at is ruining franchises Ive loved as a kid. thats why Ive been getting into writing. as I want to prove that there are good writers out there. I just want a good story bro. I want good fantasy again. all these companies care about is lining their pockets with money and abusing their workers.
well  this pretty much explains why I dislike ragnarok so much
flag on the play  unnecessary tomb raider reference.
translation  original marvel fans mean nothing to us we re only interested into hiring activists
this is why we need to move on from the mcu.
these people have been flicked too hard.
marvel either makes a change or they will be broke like dc and star wars
and then they wonder why the movies keep failing.
happy late bday!
and thats how they fail. they ignore the built-in audience.
hbo told the cast of the last of us show not to play or look up anything about the game.
itseems about that they need to just change the name of these property and let you know this is not tour. this is something else this is not black panther. this is something else.
I want to hire a mechanic . but I dont want anyone who knows anything about cars. cuz they re part of the culture
this girl has to be italian just judging by her hands while talking
guilty!
@melonie mac go boom

what till they get there hands on wolverine and the xmen they will destroy those characters
was that really you or did someone try scamming me using your name and they targeted me because I post comments on your videos what is going on
go boom
soooo... someone should make a white-only cast for the next wakanda    cuz the source material should maybe be this other thing now I want to see this happen  just to watch the heads pop.
same as 343I I guess
happy bithmas
like eric july has said  make peace with it and let it die.
lara croft comment at 1 01 I was so close I had  58 sec in pool  as charlie brown would say rats.
war is on!! true fans vs pure activists. you wokes declare war but us fans of entertainment already threw the first strike.
you should look in motorsports game s their a something very question  going on
ah..when logic no longer matters. marvel...you make me sad  or you would if I still cared.
these companies dont want fans than they can go bankrupt screw them
time for elon musk to buy marvel n purge lol
thank you !!!!  you dont want fans writting your scripts     basically your saying you dont want fans watching your movies   phase 4  no one watching   not your fault   we are horrible unwoke anarchists
ignorant writers are easier to manipulate.
and itshows.
they said they was u and I won a ps5 I just had to give 135 for shipping and handling
they made thor an absolute joke of a character.
thats a scammer  they do that with a lot of youtubers unfortunately
@melonie mac go boom  k thanks for confirming that there was this little voice that kept saying what if lol but I figured it out when I seen the person impersonating u only had six followers on telegram thanks again
thor 4 is called thor woke and cancer
new tomb raider movie woke
in what world does not hiring people who care about the product help the product  like what  clown world I swear
mel I really like your hands
love and thunder generated 750  million. I didnt see it and didn t want to. Im a boomer so people have been making things for my consumption for the last 50 years. I have no problem if somebody else wants to make something for a different audience. thor love and thunder looked like crap to me but it made 750  million. plenty of movies I loved that never made a penny. I would prefer it if they wanted to ruin properties they would ruin their own rather than ones I loved but I have trouble getting too worried about them ruining a movie based on a comic book.   if people dont like them   no one goes   studios get bankrupt and this crew gets fired. its a simple system.
analytics
woke is moloch worship. let s call it what it is.
disney marvel going in the trash bin.
the key to marvel s success  success ! bwahahahaha!
boycottdisney boycottmarvel
thank of it with military involvement and its one of usa best exports.
Im think Im done with marvel
you close to missourI lol
you have an electrical problem  hire a plumber
nate moore  and coogler  destroyed the black panther franchise.
no wonder the mcu has sucked lately! none of the writers are fans or care at all about the source material and just want to change everything
this is sickening. holy cow
after endgame all the marvel movies suck after stan lee passed they went completely woke and that equals broke
another captain obvious video.
when I want to watch spider-man  I want to watch spider-man. I dont want to watch some black albino pygmy woman who shoots webs out of her ass  and yet can bust planets with a single finger. I want to see spider-man.that is a lesson  they re currently learning. if they want the big audience that comes from the comics  they have to remain faithful to the comics.
its true
add boycott mars celebrations for removing bounties from them
cancel disney plus!!!!!!!
disney marvel is not marveldisney star wars is not star wars amazon wheel is not wheel of timeamazon rings is not Lord of the ringsparamount halo is not halo
its because old school marvel comic fans would not be willing to turn wolverine gay or dress gambit up like a drag queen.
never buy any thing marvel anymore  I used to love marvel but knowing they hate me . Im just gonna drop it  steve ditko and stan lee would be ashamed of what marvel has become
the entire movie of thor love n thuder was just a terrible woke joke urgh
marvel gonna be just like the last air bender and dragon ball evolution
which...is...great!as over the years their garbage comics and movies has made me hate marvel!now I can be the perfect candidate for their next project!
woke religion lol
let s tweak and flip this character  is such bullshit and one of the most laziest ideas ever. why change the character completely instead of creating your own
I wonder if things will change now that bob iger is back as ceo replacing bob chapek.
boycottmarvel  boycottdisneyplus
yeaa marvel is dead. I cant wait for the future of dc  gonna be infinitely greater than marvel because james gunn actually gives a crap about the source material
I tell people all the time thor ragnarok is absolutely garbage  taika is a terrible director with childish corny humor
people just complaining for the sake of complaining. this girl doesnt even have an opinion she just reads someone s article and paraphrases.
