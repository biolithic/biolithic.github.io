as someone who has been attacked on social media for my faith a couple of years ago  I can understand the feelings involved especially when said faith was not even the topic. stay strong mel! love your input and takes with all this g4 craziness.

whenever they go after your faith just tell them to do that exact same thing with islam not a single one of them will do it they are all cowards

youre definitely not insane. stay strong  keep it up!

melonie is so cool and mentally stable. just let that girl alone
keep being you  melonie. you seem very genuine and kind  and we ve got your back.

his attack on you got me to subscribe to you. thrilled to find a gamer of faith! God bless you!

you are amazing! never forget that. the only person that can bring you down is yourself. think positive

for all its worth  youre not an outcast to me melonie. keep sharing your faith. keep creating content.  and I ll keep right on watching.

so Im not religious  but I whole heartedly believe in God  I just found your videos and Im already in love with you  someone whose not afraid to speak there mind and embrace there faith with strength. I applaud you for everything you do   there should be more people like you.
I admire anyone who stands up for their faith and beliefs.  its so refreshing to see.  way to go melonie!

said this on the last vid. none of them deserve sympathy. dont let them wear you down  I dont agree with everything you have to say and Im still here. we love you.

its nice to see you sharing your faith. once I saw how based you are I subscribed.

keep the faith melonie and keep up the attitude of gratitude.

I am subscribing just because you are standing firm on your faith.

you will never be alone following your faith and us fans follow you keep up the good work.

dont let these people get on your head. I been following you since around april or march and been happy to have found you. you have a truly good heart and are a good person. anyone here in the comments can agree with me on that. stay positive and just pray for these people who are just full of hate bcuz they see how happy you are
you are the best mel! keep up the good work!

I ll also be praying for you as well. how s that for spouting my good Christian venom towards you

I did not even know your religious affiliation until that clown made a big deal about it.  you dont sound preachy or act like one of the Bible thumping hypocrites.  you posted a thoughtful tweet and did not call anyone out by name.  he is the one with a problem.  keep on keeping on.

next time someone gets angry at you  just reply with  Jesus loves you.   that will really tick them off.

Im proud of you melonie for sticking to your faith and your beliefs. and I ll keep supporting you.

his reaction to you got me to subscribe to your channel.  teamJesus

melonie mac is a kindly soul. over 2 years ago she bothered to take time to voice support toward me in a comment section when I was going through the initial part of a separation that led to my divorce. she s a legit nice person  and only a very very sick person would misinterpret that.

thanks for being you. hope my daughter and son learn from you and others like you for not taking shit and standing up for what you believe and being kind about it

you talking freely about your beliefs and opinions is a huge part of why I follow you.

your a good person. ur only human and you look and act strong for us all and speak for the real ones. I just wanted to say thank you... and ik all these ppl who talk shit and pile up on you are the bad ones. ik it can get to u off screen but just know you are a strong and good person with good values. shame on these wokies and insane ppl.
your response was very professional. some people  mostly the woke crowd  doesnt understand we are all on this beutiful mudball together. its your channel. Im not a Christian  but I love your channel  and I like the content you put out. tell the wokesters to go back to sleep.  the slept

thanks melonie for speaking out and sharing your faith!  youre awesome!
