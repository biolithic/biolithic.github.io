netflix is doing a live action avatar... man it s gonna be supremely woke
you ve been crushing it with all the streams you ve been guest appearing on! and in each one you re always a polite and funny class act. terrific job  melonie but i m especially glad to see new content that s entirely from you
the witcher can t go on without henry cavill.
netflix almost made a good decision...   which is  unfortunately  one of the problems with netflix when they try to use the ips of others.
you re right  henry is what hollywood hates  but he s what hollywood needs. witcher or not  i m glad he s sticking with his statements on the business. btw  you have a nice glow about you lately  i m sure it s for many reasons but i m so happy to see it. may god keep blessing you  have an amazing day melonie  another stellar video.
yes they should have canceled witcher. hey melonie  loved seeing you on side scrollers. you look beautiful by the way. have a good day melonie
i feel so bad for liam hemsworth  he s been given an impossible task.
netflix seems to always cancel anything they have good going on  the witcher they will kill by poor writing and not being true to the books and or games. cavil has basically given us the inside about how they have ruined the show so it s dead now.
they honestly should have  just to save themselves from a bunch of bullet shots. but no. i don t think that liam hemsworth will be able to fit in the role as much as cavil did. why netflix  you should ve just ended it.
i m surprised the didn t replace henry as geralt with a gay trans black woman that s 400  pounds.
if we replaced geralt with another witcher  we would be going fully away from the books.  you pretty much did that with season 2. the show is nothing like the books now.
henry cavill is ageing like wine. i didn t care for him 10 years ago  but he is becoming a good actor  and seems like a charismatic and honest person.
the point with hiring liam is that it doesn t matter.  the show is more about yenn and ciri anyway.  liam will fade into the background.
a positive to come out of this  other than henry cavill getting out while the getting was good  is that netflix won t be getting their claws on conan because the ip owner doesn t want conan being wokeified
we didn t love henry cavil only because he played geralt so well  we love him because he was the only one there who respected the source material and it showed.
lauren hissrich clearly wanted the character of geralt to be secondary in his own story anyway. i don t think she would even view this as a negative  because it s less resistance to her vision and she can highlight her strong female characters even more. because you know that s the only thing that matters.
you are looking well  i hope you are doing good. keep going  melonie.
it was time for him and in his life to move on .. geez  saying that she s not taking any accountability is an understatement.
witcher needs a fans of the books and games not people that hate them.  you look great   melonie.
rather than cancel the show they should ve cancelled the script as soon as they realized the show was hardly about geralt and only about yennefer and that princess who nobody really cared about.the show is called  the witcher  after all. you watch it expecting to see a story about the witcher not  random fantasy princess
one piece too
lmao imagine jaden smith playing aang xd
i can t wait till the much more capable female who was really the chosen one all along pops up. when she belittles and shows disdain for the main character and does everything perfect first time  stunning. we ve never seen that before.
is this the one set in modern day earth  in high school
@thatharvguy  that s what clownfish tv claims and of course the asian kids will be bullied.
@john durham  then  everything changed when the fire marching band attacked.
aw thank you  i appreciate you. been having a blast hopping back on my friends  podcasts! thank you again for the kind words  it means a lot
especially with miley s ex.. been better to just cancel it and start over
not at this point no  maybe somehow with some circumstances sure.  like if he had to bail out because he was sick  or personal issues like family.  but the way this played out  nope.
it won t
no show is beholden to an actor.  if the show can t go on it ll be because of pretty much any other reason. people should wait and see what hemsworth does
it couldn t go on with him either. not like season 2. not a chance in hell. and he knew he couldn t stay  because his integrity would be in the bin.
@vincevirtua  it is if everything else about it is garbage.....
@grizzled  grizzly  i enjoyed season 1 quite a bit  and bits of season 2. for me  if season 3 is back on form then season 4 is fair game for me as far as i m concerned. i m a witcher fan as opposed an  insert actor  stan.
@vincevirtua  i can see being a fan of the show if you ever read the books or played the games.
it s like every year it is something with netflix.  cuties  the witcher  avatar the last airbender  cleopatra  etc.
thank you as always  you re amazing!
@melonie mac go boom  you couldn t be more welcome!
beautifully said!
@otterloopb  thanks my dude!
here s hoping that amazon doesn t  wheel of time  his warhammer series.
thank you so much  stephen
@melonie mac go boom  you are always welcome
that s true  i ve seen quite a bit of good things being taken off  whether it s because of stuff like this or no contract renewals.
in s3  dandelion is gonna be in a gay relationship with radovid. the famous ladies man who s known worldwide for his numerous affairs with women is now gay.
now in s3 dandelion will be in a gay relationship with radovid. at this point they re doing it on purpose.
@adam cliett  indeed. i wouldn t put it pass them to introduce zoltan in season 3 and make him gay as well.
really  thank god.
it s probably because lonely cat ladies are gonna be in vogue soon  gen-x spinsters  millennial spinsters  gen-z spinsters in the making  and they re just making this to cope because they guurl powered and slay queen to the next 50-60 years of loneliness.
thank you so much!
that princess who nobody really cared about  is one of the  if not the main driving point behind the books.  ciri ends up becoming so powerful that she can travel across alternate realities  being mistaken for nimue  lady of the lake  in camelot.  the only thing blood origin got right was introducing the character of avallac h  who ends up being her soulmate across the books.
it s probably for the best that netflix cancels witcher. it s nothing without henry cavil. anyone else who want to play as geralt just won t be the withcher. great video today melonie! you look amazing too!
my guess is that they are envious because nobody wants their original stories and the only work they can get is on an existing property.  i think that eats them up and they take it out on the project.  they don t want to adapt someone else s work   so they rewrite it just because they can.
cancel it please. ruining the ip
hollywoke is really doing a great job in weaning everyone from this meaningless  meaningless entertainment industry.  there is nothing new under the sun  just cheap ip knock offs! keep up the great work letting me know when  or if  there is something worth watching!!
i have no intrest in watching it without henry cavill.
i can see it now  lizzo as geraldine of rivia  from polish folklore. slaying monsters without breaking a sweat.have a great day  melonie. your hair is very pretty today
the room is coming together! no echo from what i can tell  audio sounds a little low  maybe gain  compared to other videos i watch but not so low i can t hear it. thank you for the continued great content. i hope life is becoming easier as we keep moving forward.
they should have fired lauren and her gaggle of  writers  and make henry showrunner i m so bummed tho as really loved first season and feel this show and cast coulda have been glorious never understand why they don t just follow ip as whenever they do it s a success whereas when they don t almost always flops hard i m 45 n seen this over and over and over and yes over again
no muscular henry  no thank you  he is the main guy of the  witcher since the beginning.
well  considering cavil left  most probably  because of the shows direction to more and more disrespect the original story and go woke i have not much hope with liam who definitely will not oppose the writers on these topics like henry. on top of that  if liam is anything like his brother who is always happy to make a joke of himself  and men in general  for the wokesters  see ghostbusters 2016 or thor 4 for examples   he will even double down on what the writers want.i fully expect season 4 to be trash  even if liam does a good geralt  for that reason alone.frankly  the only reason i got through season 1 and 2 was henry  most everything else was mediocre at best  godawful at worst.
i would welcome the hell out of a lotr style cinemized series of the novels. so long as they get henry for it. and they respect the source material. which they won t... know what  forget i said anything.
i ll miss cavill playing geralt. i think henry was born to play that role  among others  though i wish he would land the james bond role  and really does his homework in preparing for any roles he portrays. it is sad he left the role because the showrunners or whoever decided to vacate the source material and try to change things. henry is not stupid. he holds himself and others he works with to a high standard. henry also respects the source material  wants to honor it in the shows movies he makes  and respects the fans. we  the fans  aren t asking too much. i feel they should ve canceled the show but they are agenda-driven more than money-driven  unfortunately. i have nothing against liam hemsworth but this will be a tall task to overcome. netflix shows and movies these days are like the game  battleship!!  they could produce a hit or a miss! crazy!!love your videos melonie! i remember when your  go boom  channel hit 30k subs and now your over 142k!  i hope you had fun earlier today on the side scrollers live stream! you are back with videos and live streams with a vengeance this week! way to get in and keep that balance in your life!
i just watched king arthur legend of the sword 2017. most underrated movie ever. the director and writer guy richie should have been hired for the witcher because it gave the same vibes as well as for the assassins creed movie. but then again. i actually liked the assassins creed movie but this director would have done a better job.
he s executive producer for warhammer.he s gonna make sure they can t mess it up this time.
they wanted him gone because he would have made something that fans of the books games liked  and thus they wouldn t be able to complain about  toxic fans
i think testing out one season with a new person  to see if it works makes sense. yeah the lead maybe different but we never know until we see it. i m probably not going to watch it but  you won t know until you test it.
i wouldnt care. same for lotrrop. i honestly ask myself how they fund all this crap. cant wait for them to go bancrupt and someone else make a real witcher series.addendum   last of us was terrible as well by the way  i totally agree!
lara croft played by a trans man  would be comedy gold. omg  it would keep melanie knee deep in content for years. lol
liam hemsworth is a bad actor  why they would choose him is beyond me  unless you wanted a total yes man  and for the franchise to fail. i don t feel sorry for liam hemsworth  he will take a butt load of money  come back to australia  invest his money in real estate  and live the good life.
the witcher is unironically one of the worst things i ve ever seen  maybe the worst. it took me something like three days to get through the first two episodes. after the got s8 fiasco  with such an emerging ip with so much potential  they should have had something great on their hands. how they took that kind of a layup and wound up with slop this terrible boggles the mind.
thanks so much andrew  awesome seeing you in the podcast chats i ve been on too!
@melonie mac go boom  lol thanks. that was a fun podcasts. can t wait to see you in more.
with good script he would have turn out better. if you wanna see an adaptation of witcher in which shitty script doesn t hinder job of an actor watch polish series hexer  2002
only  25
bahaha amazing. thank you!
@melonie mac go boom  you re welcome
how will she slay the monsters without breaking sweat  by breaking wind!!!eeeeeewwwwwww!!!
what part of netflix makes you think they would do something like that
does anyone know if warhammer is going to be a movie or a series or a series of movies.
they should have dropped it.
cavill leaving after the last season is the reason i canceled my netflix subscription in the first place. i won t watch a witcher show without him. crushing it as always melonie!
i m glad it wasn t canceled. now it can crash and burn!
if we replaced geraralt we would fully go off the books  nobody wants that  but they already did that
honestly i enjoyed both versions of lara. of course the traditional one is far superior  but the one from survivor timeline is quite nice. i would prefer her to be some relative of croft so lara could be as she was but yeah  we have what we have.
the witcher season 3 hot  garage.
i m glad you uploaded another video melonie. i am having a really rough time  but seeing your beautiful face always makes me feel better. god bless you.
henry cavill s agent is dany garcia. she s also dwayne  the rock  johnson s agent and ex-wife. they re offered many of the same roles. guess who sees them first.
let s be honest here  the only reason they re continuing without henry cavill is ego. the witcher tv show has become a vanity project for lauren hissrich  who s just the kathleen kennedy of the franchise. sad to see.
they have essentially canceled the show through story decisions anyway. it has leaked that in season 3  dandelion  the world renowned ladies man  and womanizer  will be in a gay relationship with radovid  king of redania . i quit watching in season 1 but surely this will be enough for the rest to jump ship.
it s not too late to cancel now
he s not just an audience draw  but it sounds like he was supplying the duct tape to stop the adaptation from falling apart just like the actor for wednesday.
what they really meant was they have more woke stories to tell.
2 10 i swear if melonie say one more thing about tomb raider on another topic not related to it .. imma laugh
hey  melonie i just wanted to tell you that i like your outfit you had on yesterday  tuesday  in your video and your curly hair looks beautiful and lovely too. also i have to say that i am sorry for this being late from yesterday  tuesday  but i am out of town this week in clover south carolina visiting with my older sister and her family this week and this weekend and i won t be back in town until next monday very late and so i will try to catch up on your videos for this week  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to say that i think that netflix should have cancelled the witcher tv series bc it won t be the same without henry cavil playing his character role in the show series and so i was hoping for it to be cancelled bc how it has been so tiring and boring show to watch and no body would enjoy it   keep watching it as long as it was being filmed on netflix. anyway that i is all i have to say about this video from yesterday  tuesday   ok melonie. anyway have a great week if i don t respond to your videos for this week.
don t ask questions. just consume product and then get excited for next product.
the witcher has been one of the more popular games with men.  if netflix is making it woke and afraid of the male gaze  it could be a loser  because the male gamers are leaving.
i cancelled my wokeflix subscription well over a year ago.
i remember when companies just wanted to make money
there is a lot more to it with the superman stuff. it wasn t simply wb deciding not to use him. he was brought on by wb producers who were not in charge of dc content. they were trying to muscle their way into power and running the upcoming dc studios. they tried to  listen  to fans about bringing cavill back but the fans pushed back when they realized it wasn t the same superman that zack snyder was putting on screen. ultimately zaslav who runs wb decided to go with safran and gunn for dc studios wanting them to create something new because there is so much bad juju with what dc has been for the last ten years there really is no other way to do it.
imo liam hemsworth shouldn t try. i think  it could damage his career  if he doesn t fit the role. he will disappoint  can t compete with cavill  and that could overshadow his whole career
i will give season 3 a try only because of henry cavill and his acting and presence
white  wolf is problematic. we are renaming him rainbow wolf
at this point they may as well shoehorn their own character since it s not that faithful an adaptation anyway. cavill made it tolerable  but the show was going downhill from the start i think. first season was  okay  at best.
your tattoo and that shirt are a perfect match. holy shit.
almost is not good enough.
i doubt that any real fan will watch this and i kinda feel sorry for liam
henry cavill the unluckiest actor alive
how is lauren histrich still the showrunner for the witcher at this point netflix should be on their knees grovelling to cavil and begging him to come back. sacking histrich and giving cavil full creative control.
thanks.
yeah  it should ve canceled it from the beginning. they butchered a perfectly good money-making opportunity. could have made a three-part movie based on the main story of the game. then they could have based the tv series on the witcher contracts and focused it around the bestiary. could have even sold them as a novelty and made a killing. so long as they stayed true to the story  and accurate portrayal of the characters.
it was a bad show  so yeah
im glad that i get to avoid all these shows by having had cancelled my wokeflix sub couple years ago.. watching you dismantle the nonsense is much more entertaining and useful.  3
this show was already bad despite having henry in it. and since he was the only good thing about it  i can t imagine how bad it will be without him. with regards to introducing a female witcher  we ll that would contradict the books completely. not that they haven t tried it - in season 2  vesemir desperately wants ciri to go for the mutation trials despite knowing  at least he should have  that girls can not survive it... at least that s in how it is in the books. also   small addition - in the books  vesimir doesn t want to continue creating witchers in general because he had enough of watching so many boys die during that process. again  in the netflix series  he s desperate to continue. f    off netflix!
just go full pirate to spit on their viewer score
wait  now she s concerned about  going fully away from the books    what in the george r. r. martin hell is she trying to pull
not the witcher netflix.tolkien and by extension  peter jackson had such vast imagination and vision when it came to differing races species and cultures in a fantasy world. the elves are elevated  regal and clearly depicted as ancient beings that has transcended the trifling squabbles of lesser beings. moving and conducting themselves with such grace and elegance   you can clearly see they are of a superior civilisation. it gives the elves  every faction  a unique feel and atmosphere to them.the same unique different feel is also captured within the witcher games  the elves feel like a race elevated to that of the humans   dwarves and so on.in contrast  netflixs creations are all so generic  bland and decrepit   with absolutely no difference between humans  elves or dwarves. netflix propaganda writers just want to create a world they want to see  a decrepit   homogenous pit of gray excrement   every fantasy species race faction consist of every earthly race  white  asian black  indian   there is absolutely zero distinction to any faction or people group. it is just a cauldron of mediocre  braindead cussing people with malformed ears. the world the woke cult wants to see.regardless of henry cavill s perfect casting and his enthusiasm and love for the games and books  from the get go i knew   not the witcher   on netflix would be dead on arrival. it  was like giving a piece of priceless art to a shit fisted chimpanzee   only there to smear its feces all over the existing canvas.  i was excited for season 1 only because of cavill ..but as always in today s age of the woke feminazi cult  i immediately saw them relegate geralt   the namesake of the franchise to the background to promote the diverse females in their propaganda piece.thus i have refused to even continue entertaining the very notion of netflix s not the witcher.i really don t mind companies wanting to make money. what i do mind  and despise is when talentless   visionless dim-witted cretins  don t have the brains to create anything new in their image  so instead they take well loved  richly culturally based  european culture   stories  created by vastly superior minds and corrupt them  defile them and distort them with only one aim  promoting the propaganda of their fascist  feminist woke cult.  that i will not abide by.   the shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot make  not real things of its own. i don t think it gave life to orcs  it only ruined them and twisted them    - frodo  the return of the king. evil is sterile. it cannot create  cannot imagine or have new ideas  certainly cannot produce new forms of life  it may be able to propagate  but only in the manner of the virus or the corruption  by turning everything into more of itself. beings who have fallen under evil control  whether they are reforged into a minion or taken over by their superpowered evil side  become cruder and twisted versions of themselves. they may gain power  but they lose crucial aspects that once made them special  and will probably not behave very intelligently.  ultimately  the hope of this kind of evil is to  at best  corrupt the whole world into being just like itself  and at worst  destroy everything. the possibility of making something new and different is anathema to it. 1 corinthians 15 33 -   don t be deceived  bad company corrupts good character.isaiah 5 20 - 20 woe unto them that call evil good  and good evil  that put darkness for light  and light for darkness  that put bitter for sweet  and sweet for bitter!23 which justify the wicked for reward  and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!each year hollywood netflix amazon disney modern   entertainment   cnn bbc fox   evolves further and further into the reich ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda.it doesn t aim to entertain provide factual news  it s only aim is to emulate joseph goebbels   mastering the art of spreading the propaganda of their repulsive woke feminazi cult.
and they should ve. now we hearing about jaskier being bisexual in season 3 and having crush on radovid. what. the. fuck.imagine how henry felt reading this shitty script  we all know  why he left  and we totally get it! henry deserves more. and netflix made huge mistake. i think season 3 will flop  they will look at metrics and cancel this shit show.
i think i kind of get where they are coming from in bringing on people who aren t fans because they don t want people trying to make it their fan fiction  but the problem is they re bringing in people who just want to use it as their platform for their own messages.
don t feel bad if they decide to fuk up lara even more  we still have the original and only true lara croft games.i felt the same when i read what they ve done to my boy frank castle. now  they made him even worse by resurrecting  his wife who says he was abusive and she wanted a divorce. he isn t even a husk of his true self anymore. i am in my 50s and have been a fan since day 1. i ve read and owned every comic since castle s 1st book. those  i treasure and i m glad i haven t read a coming in more than 10yrs. i also loved the netflix show. to date  it is the only live action that is worth a damn and is the closest to the lore. we can t stop them from trashing the worlds and people s we love  we can however hold on to what we know. frank will always be a grey area good guy ending crime 1 bullet at a time and lara will always be that sexy tomb raiding broad in it for the adventure and thrills. they ruined star wars  indiana  willow i was really sad about willow   witcher  and many  many other classic franchises without signs of stopping.  anyway......
they should have fired everyone except henry cavil  and no the discount hemsworth will never escape his more talented brothers shadow
about the only good piece of witcher content netflix has produced was that anime nightmare of the wolf. it seems only anime is producing good fantasy content these days.
it s over for them
they want to go away from the books  they want to insert their own stories in to it on how the witcher should have been.  rather than destroy geralt they could have made up a random witcher to ruin.
i know hollywood is already making a crappy remake of true lies but man henry cavill as harry from true lies would be epic
liam is going to be to henry cavill and the witcher  what sammy hagar was to david lee roth and van halen. not bad but not it won t be nearly the same or as good.
what should have happened  netflix makes cavill an offer he can t refuse to stay  and make him an executive producer with editorial control.
you mean too many stories to bastardize
ohhhh they discussed ending the show after henry s exit huh   then what   they must have remembered that netflix would show any piece of sh-- show because blood origins was a thing.  so they said ehhh why not dig the witcher franchise farther into the ground.  you can still see the feet sticking out of the grave.
from what i ve heard  the witcher series was the first to use the bait   switch that marvel performed in the multiverse of madness.
the witcher s writing was terrible to begin with. i was bored out of my mind. cavill was the only thing that peaked my interest  but not even a great actor like him could save that series
more teats to milk on this cow.   facts spoken by a true country girl.
netflix  why would we stop when we can destroy the witcher some more
melonie  have you had public speaker presenter instruction   it s one of my biggest complaints with content creators yet you have a very polished and silky presence.
netflix is the problem  they didn t give him a long enough contract with a clause  that requires him to film around his other commitments.
well i m not gonna watch it so if i m not i m gonna assume most real fans won t eitherok let s be real here it all depends on the writing. and the writing has been awful so why would we think it will change.
i m going to say something people probably won t like.the witcher tv series is terrible  even henry cavill couldn t save it. people who think he should stay on as geralt are clearly overhyping him. don t get me wrong  i love the guy and i think he  could  be a great geralt  it s just the way he is written and his dialogue is just awful. it s such a shame this brilliant ip is wasted on crappy writers who had all the blueprints there to create something special and instead destroyed it and annoyed fans and couldn t even keep causal watchers engaged
never watched the show and never will. i dont like henry cavill either  he s a moron.having said that he was seemingly the only person that actually cared about the source material  so to get rid of him is corporate suicide.
if they can t make something good with someone as versed in witcher lore and as big of a fan as hc  what the hell makes them think they can make something good with someone else lol
thank you! yes  i did professional hosting in the gaming industry for over a decade until i got canceled and went independent. worth
they should cancel it all . if it wasn t for kdrama s  i would have cancelled netflix long ago. i refuse to watch any american made crap. it is 99.99  pure trash - just like our culture. the korean s still know how to make fantastic tv - in general the stories are well developed  they have a great narrative flow and the acting is top notch. even the mediocre dramas are better than ours. shows like my mister  good bad mom  the glory  hello me  kingdom  my name  etc. are so much better than anything this country has made in decades that it is hard to understand how we have sunk so low.
the emperor protects
nice lara croft life size statue. i got one myself and it s fully articulated with life like soft skin.
if i tip melonie 49.99 could she do a video review from the marvels teaser trailer. also arnold schwarzenegger has a new netflix show fubar this friday.
saw you on side scrollers - ace work collaborating with stuttering craig  d
i wish they would sell the rights to film the witcher to henry cavill. he would have been a much better writer and director.
hollywood has gotten sad and repetitive with  use well known ip  make main character usually a white male of ip the background character to female character  make female character the best evar!!!1! ... profit  or not.
most defo should have cancelled. henry cavill loved the witcher games. when he got the role he read all the books and had a full grasp respect for the lore and world the author had created.
without henry cavill the show is nothing they might as well just cancel it
you can t out geralt the superfan true  but you re missing the bigger point here  the whole reason why he is leaving is because the writers want to make the show their own.what are the odds that hemsworth is going to stand up to them equally or more than caville there is no way he can shine as the witcher when they hate his guts for being a straight white male.i d say i look forward to watching him drop his sword in a pivotal scene and ciri saves him  but i m not going to be watching  so...
i really don t understand why they aren t canceling it. they re just throwing money away.
i boycotted netflix over this.
without henry  it should be canceled. with their woke storylines  it should be canceled.
nice hair day lady! o7
i feel that this entire situation is pretty dumb. i mean geralt was first portrayed by henry cavill sure but that does not mean that no one but henry can play geralt.that s like saying no one but tobey maguire can be spider man  or no one but ben affleck can be batman. characters change actors all the time. since when is that a problem  this generation just complains about literally any and everything.i m looking forward to liam hemsworths take on the character  and anyone that may come after him down the road.
tbh  i d trade witcher for 40k any day. henry cavill is probably the only reason i watched it anyway looking back
is that a life size lara behind you    you should stand next to it  melonie
you can t have a female witcher.  that would just be a witch...  that s the whole point of the word  witcher   to be a masculine form of witch...
they should have gotten actual slavs to play geralt and the rest of the cast. but then they d all be white and we can t have that.
personally  i don t think they should cancel. the original books and the games still exist  and the quality of those different pieces of media won t be dragged down just because of a bad adaptation. i think they should continue to produce the series with their hatred of the fans on full-display. no one will watch it  they ll lose money  and we can pray to god day in and out that netflix will finally die off  no  i still won t look past  mignonnes   netflix should ve been in the grave the day that garbage got released .obviously  here i m speaking as a witcher fan and netflix hater  but if i were a netflix executive  yes  i d cancel the show. that being said  i really like when huge corporations based around entertainment show how much they don t care to be entertaining. it helps them fail  and let s doors open up for new  more creative minds.
@photriuspyrelus  well...in polish language they use wiedzmin for male and wedma is used for female.
a woman witcher is impossible  that s canon. if they do it however  it s really a rape of the book
i miss the echo...
i ve read 5 witcher books. i ve played the games for almost thousand hours. i bought in-universe books and stuff just to collect. i love the witcher brand. i m a  snyder cultist . i freaking love henry cavill.then i watched the first season. now i love the witcher brand less thanks to the show. nough said.
you fine  hopefully  i m allowed to say that in this day and age. you fine tho!
l netflix...
i hope new execs get power before long.  i think in fantasy n comics people generally want to see hot  capable people being powerful and heroic and sexy.  it s not that hardthese things are all power fantasies.  comics  fantasy   video games   not a platform for representation and agenda but a basic power fantasy people love henry cause he s classy and guys and girls want to be like him  bed him  befriend him  etche s an aspirational role model there s nothing wrong with this!  it s not racist or sexist just costs us great tv and it sucks and how on earth is this advocating or improving anything !
not only the witcher show should be canceled  but also their so-called  documentary  on queen cleopatra.
if i even watch the witcher season 3 i m not watching any season beyond that without henry cavill.  i m thinking season 3 is going to be an absolute trainwreck anyway  and then tada  hemsworth.....
are there still people watching the witcher  btw  can you humor us with a classic lara cosplay donning a bomber jacket
no offence to henry cavill but the man cannot act. he gets work because of his looks
as far as i m concerned  there is no the witcher without henry cavill  he will always be the only true geralt in my eyes granted i also believe they should have gotten amy adams to play triss merigold  so take my opinion with a grain of saltthanks for the video melanie  and have a terrific day everyone  god bless
they d better stop while they can. henry is required.
i mean most people aren t going to watch it without him on the show anyway it seems and i m already planning to not even bother with season 3 because i m already unhappy with what they did with season 2 and i just don t want to watch this show anymore regardless of it being henry s last season. they really made me upset when they went away from the original source material heavily in the second season and also butchered my favorite character being eskel by making him different than how he is in the actual lore and also turning him into a tree. and because of that decision and other decisions that they did for the storytelling of season 2 i will not be watching season 3 or the show ever again. they already have changed and walked away from the original source material and i don t want to support the show any longer because of the decisions they have made with the story.
hey melonie! you look very beautiful today. they should have just cancelled it after the last season. could barely finish the 2nd season as it was.
they should cancel it. henry cavill was the only thing that made that show worth watching anyway.
it should never have been made. it was garbage from the beginning.
yes
just hear me out  danny da vito should be great. if we can t have cavill i at least want to be entertained.
they didn t want to go away from the books   they already did
ayo yo that lara croft statue is checking you out.
unless it s ciri. ciri can be considered the only female witcher but she s not a true witcher.
oof  amy adams... no no no. awful. i agree with you on cavill  but not adams. not for triss.
@james bee  in my defense  i don t know that many red-haired female actressesedit  well  i just did a quick google search and found out that amy adams is actually naturally a blond and i am easily fooled
@james bee  is she possibly as bad as the one they chose  whomever the current actress is - she isn t very pretty  and she looks like she is faking trying to be a redhead or something. makes it really awkward  like if you took a pale white peep and painted their face black to try to fill that role. maybe i m wrong  but i don t see how amy would look worse than what they chose.
netflix had a chance to do the right thing  instead they are going to ruin the legacy with discount thor
they should have cancelled this travesty. seeing as though they fired literally the only reason to watch this show. which was henry cavill. xd
wait until they change geralt to geraltina.
wow  i thought they already had. nobody s gonna watch that it without cavill  especially knowing the reasons why he left. just bin it.
i disliked last of us show in general and the game  only the first last of us game was decent enoughalthough i feel bad for henry cavil
gosh melonie your definitely a keeper woman shame alot more women were like you none woke no bs feminine as you should be don t ever change my dear
they should never have made the show to begin with. nothing against cavill but it was cancer from the first episode.
sorry i was late. i was drinking water. everyone have a wonderful day.
good  i m glad he left and i m glad it s burning. season 2 was an absolute travesty. i was out the moment season 2 episode 2 s credits rolled. wasn t watching any further with or without him.
i have never liked a show that changes leads mid run  this time hearing the behind the scenes i don t think i ll be paying to see the final season
the latest episode of the lara croft show
tom cruise is gay... literarily. or so i ve heard lol
should have.
to me cavill played a better geralt than geralt did and thats a problem for the next poor b stard.
kwasade against the algorithm !!!

the show is going to be bad regardless. cavill left for a reason
a bit offtopic mel  but what do you think of ygs new girlband babymonster  its like the sisterband of blackpink
this show shouldn t happen in this form  with this showrunner  with this writters room to begin with. having 1 person on the entire team passionate about the franchise  was not enough - yes even with cavill this was still a pile of stinking poop. all this show did  was damaging the brand  to the point where i believe sapkowski could have a court case  dthis lil netflix fart is just embarassing. yes  cancel it.
the show is dead since season two aired.
i ve been following them to see what they can do
@melonie mac go boom  ahhhyy  these girls are horribly talented  i love haram  shes an incredible vocalist!think these girls will crush the web  and take over the world  3
it s time for them to do so.
almost...they will definitely cancel the show after season 3
they still might depending on how season 3 does
imo the show was pretty bad even with cavill. him and freya are fantastic while everything else about the show is kinda terrible. i already wasn t intending to watch season 3.
hey just so you know i think something is wrong with your sound your video today sounds echo like it s weird it doesn t sound like it normally does just giving you a friendly head s up
be like john wick without keanu just wouldn t work anymore i don t get why they keep using people that just hate the show they are making  it s like employing the oil industry to work on green energy to replace fossil fuels lol
netflix should cancel it without henry
the backlash would have been way less harsh i think.
they had an out and didn t take it. that tells you how blind they are to things.
at this point  let it all burn. there s no saving or changing anything.
there s no need for netflix to cancel the witcher  i just canceled netflix....
im not watching it because they replaced him  but im also not even gonna watch the new last season hes gonna be in anyways because of the shit their trying to pull with changing the story and characters etc.
hey pretty melonie  i just going to see the first part with cavill to me cavill is the witcher so i have no isuess with the new actor but i just dont care. and sure tlous is not  perfect it would be ideal with less woke but still a great tv show.
why so standing melanie
this is so cooked...
i ve noticed you don t have your chair  mel. still setting up the studio
netflix turned gold into grade a crap  well done!!
no  because watching season 3 and then having them cancel it after henry cavill leaves is much better.
someone in making the descions is trying to prove something to someone.
bs he left why start it if you won t finish it
don t be fat
@melonie mac go boom  i ll agree to that
standing desk
but i m biased because i loved the show
i canceled it... so  i don t really care what they do or do not cancel
hems should have come in as vesamir live action. but not gerald
doug cockle was the only geralt for me. knew the netflix thing would be a load of wank.
the last of us the game part 2 suck and the tv serie have the same story of the game why because its suck
so close!
whaaaaaaaat
looking stylish melonie mac!
showrunner is a confusing term and hollywood. i m sure a lot of people think that that is some type of pa on the set on par with the regular producers behind the show but it s not. showrunner is the way to determine who is the most senior of the executive producers when you have more than one executive producer on a project. it s literally the most important part of the production. because they deal with the money and interacting with the network or streaming service that the movie or show is appearing on. having said that the showrunner for the witcher should have been smarter. they re trying to keep the cash coming their way rather than do the right thing and end the show when henry cavill leaves the show
can we just stop to say how beautiful melanie is  cuz she s just so damn hot.
the china man is come.
good god you re absolutely gorgeous sorry back to the witcher without henry caville they aren t anything they need to cancel it
