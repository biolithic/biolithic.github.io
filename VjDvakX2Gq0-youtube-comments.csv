my nephew did two tours in afghanistan. was a combat engineer and was a sargent stationed at fort campbell in tennessee. he taught many soldiers until he literally fell out of a helicopter. after years of fighting overseas what was accomplished there ! !until recently he has been fighting here in the usa that he fought for literally saw his fellow soldiers get blown up running out of body bags and having to put his friends parts in trash bags!!! fought to get his va benefits jumping through hoops to prove that his injury was  service related  like the video and all the student soldiers around weren t enough proof for the us government!!!this country cares more about dylan the guy wearing  woman face  making a mockery of true born women instead of helping our  homeless disabled vets  abused children and hard working americans. god help us all.
as a former usmc iraq veteran  i find this incident particularly disturbing.  thank you for bringing this to people s attention.  as you say  the us is legitimately dead as a nation  yet intact in certain respects.        i could not  in good faith  serve in the military under the current regime.  just look at the weaponisation of the military in the latest state of the union propaganda video claiming half the us population to be terrorists  marines standing behind the cic  clown in chief .
as a marine mom  this breaks my heart. my dad was a hero in wwii he would be so sad if he was alive today
wow  lady!!! this was the best of your videos i have ever seen!! i was nodding in agreement all the way through  and i will be sharing this video to all of my friends and family. you are 1000  correct!!! on everything!!! thank you for addressing this on your platform. so many youtubers  or any social media platform  are afraid to talk about god  and what is coming. thank you for talking about it!!! how can we expect god s covering over our country when we ve taken god out of the very foundations of it  the woke liberal agendas are 100  anti-god! the current administration is anti-god! christianity is at an all time low in america  and america will face judgement for our transgressions. we are right now in the shadow of the tribulation  and  there is a reason why america is not in the book of revelation!! war is coming  famine is coming  and jesus is coming very very soon!!! thank you for your very powerful message patriot nurse  and may god bless you and protect you and yours.
clearly this patriot was targeted.  prayers for his speedy recovery.  patriot nurse. you keep bringing these messages.  it is refreshing to see such a smart  articulate  god fearing woman bringing the truth and receipts to back it up. many blessings patriot
well said. we all needed to hear this. get ready america  it s coming!
john adams was correct  there is nothing which i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties  each arranged under its leader  and concerting measures in opposition to each other. this  in my humble apprehension  is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our constitution.
we are headed into darkness  thank you patriot nurse for telling the truth.  this trajectory has to stop or we are doomed.  let s go brandon
this woman is spot on the point! love listening to her.
this makes my heart sick for your loss. evil is more evident than ever. the corruption in this country makes me so angry. i continue to pray for revelation and guidance. many blessings to all. you are right about the medical system. after being a nurse for 43 years i left. non compliant.
wow. i felt the lord leading me to prepare many years ago. i knew something bad was coming and i needed to be prepared to take care of god s people. i lay low and stay quiet while i work. i don t know how to let people know exactly where i am and the many gifts i can bring to the table to help others. i m a very experienced nurse  educator   christian. i m retired from the rat race. i am ready to help those in need. i m in virginia
your fire and passion were a huge blessing to me tonight! sh ma israel adonai elohenu adonai echad  baruch shem k vod malchuto  l olam vaed!  dear sister i share your deep love and care for the land and people of israel. i too have many friends there  over whom i keep a mantle of prayer. praying also for the stern family. i have said for a very long time that when the usa finally pays the price for dividing god s land  the price is going to be significant. yes  judgment is way overdue against this nation  and i do not see any genuine repentance forthcoming. i m endeavoring to do all the prep work you always so generously teach us  and i appreciate that you always put the commandments and word of god as  1 on the list!  stay fired up and stay well.  yah bless you on every hand!
i saw this coming many years ago  and quietly but steadfastly started preparing myself. i ve told so many people that we have lost  generations of our youth and to get yourselves prepared for a spiritual judgment  it s not going to be pretty.i m 68 years old  traveled all over the world and engaged with many people and cultures  and from standing and looking back on america it actually made me sad to see the decadence and corruption of this nation. this current administration is an accumulation of pure evil and perversion  it s beyond rationalization and complete lunacy that they now openly stand and hold there fist directly in the face of god.you might want to ask yourself a simple question  if you re seeing what they re unafraid to show you  can you only imagine what s bubbling below the surface of their perverted ideology these people are truly demonic  evil now roams freely amongst us  i encourage everyone to pray for israel and for god s merciful grace within our own lives  this is a time to guard your heart and be vigilant in the quiet whisper of the holy spirit delivering wisdom as you continue your journey in these trying times  we are being tested and judged. danny in texas
so glad that you have recovered from your sickness!!!  it s always so good to hear your voice and to hear the truth about our great nation!!  you are 100  correct about everything i heard in your message today!!  you are loved here in tennessee and i pray god s blessing s on you and your ministry!!  hope you have a great week!   i ll be watching for a new video   thanks patriot nurse!!!!!!
thank you for this. i ve been watching your channel for quite some time now and  although i rarely if ever comment  i would like you to know that you have been instrumental in me prepping and get to g back to faith in god. i m 64  and live in scotland  work in healthcare so you can imagine the wokeness. i can do everything else you recommend except for the bullets. not allowed them here in the uk. but i ll do what i can and leave the rest to god. i m appalled at what happened to your friend and hope he recovers well. god bless you and keep you.
watched the entire video. fantastic monologue! i m sorry your friend got shot!  it hit me real hard a few years ago  when i saw troops abandoned in afghanistan withdrawal  while i was kicked out of coffee shops because i didn t have the proper paperwork  new orleans .
thank you for this video. i think it was probably the best  most important video you ve ever done  and i m sharing it with as many people as possible  because they need to hear what you have to say.
thank you patriot nurse for all your guidance.
thank you for your videos over the years.  look  i m a 50 year old white  conservative  christian  southern woman. i was raised by a narcissist boomer father   an emotionally non available mother. i was thrown out at 16. both my parents remarried   i was in the way. pregnant   married at 17. had my wonderful daughter. divorced at 19. married the meanest narcissist man i ever met. had ovarian cancer   total hysterectomy at 24. was beaten regularly. meanwhile trying to shield my child. finally escaped. now my health is not good. can t eat. searching for housing. was expecting tax return. nope bidens regime changed tax laws. i ve never been so afraid. i don t want to ever be homeless. me   my cat are staying temporarily with my friend. i have a chronic illness   work 40 hours a week. i can t afford these rent prices. i keep  praying. i can t shake this feeling off looming doom. i miss my grandparents. they were of the  greatest generation . my parents were spoiled by them. i was an inconvenience. they tried to force me to abort my daughter. i wouldn t do that! she is my greatest gift! a good christian  conservative woman. she married a narcissist   he moved her to connecticut. now they re divorced   a libtard judge won t let my daughter   grandson move home to nc where all her family is. she s handling it all with grace. anyway  i m super depressed   i guess needed to share. thank you for the years of videos. may god please help us.
perhaps some form of solace to you is to realize   you are not alone !much love from guam !!!
thanks for keeping us updated  i feel so connected to this  as someone who carries multiple guns daily and train often  to actually see someone survive such an incident  and also having the medical equipment and knowledge to use it is incredible and inspiring.
thank you   thank you for you re service   my sincere condolences for the loss of your family friend. i say family because marines are a family
this makes my heart ache to read.
i am sorry for you.  i was in the navy 6 years and ended up working for the va.  that is where i really found out in economics why government is major pieces of shit
unfortunately  we no longer have a government my friend. we have a cartel. been that way for quite some time. glad to see you re feeling better
thank him for his service  god bless you this is truth
i will thank you all. he is only 30. he went in right out of high school. i ve never pressed him on any information as i m sure a lot is classified based on rank and just too traumatic to speak about. the things i know are only because he would share bits and pieces. i know he use to write my sister and ask for a slingshot so he could hit the youth with rocks because though they had guns pointed he didn t want to have to shoot them. i think the things he has seen and done will be with him forever. most people today have no idea what our military has been through for us. literally destroyed mentally if not physically or both.
my military son is in the heated area in the news right now   he was supposed to come home today but has to stay longer! please pray for him and the others.  thank you.
21b  iraq and afghanistan  in 09.  carried a few friends out of there.  i m amazed by how much i ve changed. id never join the army now.
@kristine richardson  god bless you and him... and everyone here in the comments. stay strong everybody. walk with god and his son. don t let the enemy take your focus off of your walk. we will prevail with him.
sadly i believe this country is done. the us is not in revelation so we therefore are not a player in the end times. no politician can save us. our focus needs to be on the lord. believers have his blessed hope. we need to be praying for and reaching out to those who are not saved.
@d cook  100  my friend.
i m thankful for those of you current or former military who condemn the current state of the country. i never would have thought years ago that i would be grateful that the us military is falling well short of their recruitment goals like they are now. of course there are also negatives about that being the case.
i lost my marine corp son back in 2012 coming home after two tours in afghan. an awesome man and captain at the time  he just retired as a major  gave his own dress blues for my son to wear because my sons arms from working out didn t fit him. i literally called captain kaskela last year and told him  you need to get out now  please don t wait.  praise god he did just that even though he could have made a lot more money as a major. believe me or not  doesn t matter  the lord gave me one dream my entire life  everything in that dream has occurred except one. the nuke that hits my state of ny. i was shown  ny is the first hit  then around our nation. i told him you have a wife and kids and they will need him there. this government does not give a crap about it s military. but i do appreciate that you gave your time and pain for people like me. may the lord jesus bless you for that.  hugs
we all should have read smedley butler long before we sign on the dotted line. all wars bankers wars...
@cheryl whitlock  praying for your son.
@thepatriotnurse    the top executives  cabinet  all top military hierarchy should have the same va health care as regular military.
@todd foster  correction. cartels have honor.
my nephew did as well. he told us about the trash bags he had to use to pick up his friend s body parts. came back disabled and never the same again.
i would like to thank your nephew for his service .
@d cook  yes it is.  the whole of babylon
i know too many and in the beginning a spell was cast upon the minds
@tubatuba  true
as a former 12b  40 years ago  i send the utmost respect to your nephew  and thank him for his service and sacrifice. great warriors came out of fort campbell  ky.  remembering arrow air lines flight 1285. december 12  1985.
that s absolutely true. god bless your nephew. he needs to get 3 confirmations from private doctors with test only then will anyone even start to listen. it also has to be documented in his medical records. many peoples records have been purged of anything that they can be held accountable for. so tell him to not give up. i was told that i should be getting  100  but that i wouldn t. also 50  of 3000 according to correct math is 1500. the va and government use a different type of math.
@thepatriotnurse  yes it s a very sad environment to be in! keep praying  there s so much power in it!! keep the faith alive!!
@jonathan gardner yes i seen that by the first gulf war .i was a cold war veteran. and i use to recommend younger people. to join the military and get a skill .but by the first gulf war i wasn t doing that. and now try to talk them out of it. all wars are bankers wars..
these people who film instead of helping should all be charged.imo
@d cook  all would make more sense to you if you realized our country most definitely is in revelation  end times
amen. wwii vets  would have ended this crap before it started.
america is mystery babylon. it was a mystery because the land didn t exist at that time of the prophecy. it s absolutely in the last book  and it doesn t end well. read rev 18 again  specifically rev. 18 23
appreciate your feedback ...do well to drop a note....let s talk  directly
hallelujah! i will sing  when he returns. yeshua hamasciach!
the only problem we have right now is we don t have two parties  we have the uniparty.
@trip  two sides of the same coin.
lex  rex
the constitution makes no mention at all of political parties.  they are totally unnecessary in our presidential-congress system.  they are something we unfortunately inherited from the british parliamentary-cabinet  westminster system of government.
@trip  yes the uniparty vs the people !
thanks   for the  history and knowledge  .      awakened  to sensible truth .
leave these criminals nothing! they will have nothing and be happy!
i ve been preparing as best i can to survive what s coming for a frw years.i also am in mecklenburg va and pretty much alone. very concerning times.
@tracie becker  are you down near south hill  my son lives in that area. i m between colonial heights and hopewell.
we found a group called american contingency. you may want to look them up. seems like it s just people who want to be available to each other to help others and teach them.
why do your people deny the deity of jesus christ   have you read the new testament   matthew was written for the swej.
i m 63. i saw it coming a long time ago. i pray god have mercy upon those that serve him
psalms 37 1-40 amen
yes danny  this texan agrees with you.
im a texan now.....40 plus years. i saw this coming as a child  who was molested  kidnapped  raped  and tortured at different times  many times. when children are no longer able to be children  we all lose. now we are fatally lost and only god can save us.
born and raised in sc. i too as 51 year  see the evil working and destroying our nation. tearing down our morals  our beliefs  our foundation of what this country once stood for. we as a whole walked away from god and will pay the price.  pray ask our lord almighty for forgiveness and mercy!!! jesus christ is the answer!!!
i concur  danny
you all are right on so many levels. yet i have faith that god will punish those responsible and protect his children.
agree with you completely.
@danny archer  i am 66 and have almost the exact same background......and sentiments. so sad. best thing s we will likely be dead and gone before everything implodes. i need to miss that event.
wellspoken for many of us danny in texas
danny archer  well said   ... this is a time to guard your heart and be vigilant in the quiet whisper of the holy spirit delivering wisdom as you continue your journey in these trying times  we are being tested and judged.
i will keep you in my prayers.

prayers for you and yours  sister.
@dena c
praying in jesus name i hear you similar life challenges but trusting god and groaning for redemption maranatha
praying for you all!

i hear you and have similar history. weirdly similar with a few differences. is there a chance you could go to your daughter s
i am not surprised because i had about 65 years warning of this. i was raised a a little jw kid. left that well over 50 years ago.  but i remember like back in 1959 or 1960 they were preaching the world would go this way. as an elementary school kid i couldn t imagine what that would be like. for the next 60 years i discounted it as nonsense. but ever since 2016 i have seen this unfold exactly as i was told decades ago. it s all coming true. and it s worse than anything i could imagine except for nuclear war which is next.  i also remember general george patton saying at the end of ww2 that   we have defeated the wrong enemy.  what did he mean  by dec 1945 he was dead. killed in a very suspicious car accident. i guess before he could say what that meant.btw trivia  general eisenhower was also raised as  little jw kid and would have heard the same warning that i did about the world but i guess 50 years before i did. he did wan about the military industrial complex in his farewell speech when he left office as president. we know what happened to his successor. his warning was already too late. the fate of america had already been cast. you can count the steps to economic  social and moral disintegration of america from that to the present day. so this may all be a surprise to all you that never had that religious instruction but not me or those kids of long ago like me.
i was hoping all day you would broadcast tonight thank you ! i have recently been happy that my parents are passed so they will not see what has happened here!!!  the last 3 generations have totally lost any control over the government.  i am heartbroken......sorry for the loss of a friend.....
thank you for all this information!  thank you for your heart for hashem.  soooo glad to hear david   rachel are okay.   please always come on here with the truth no matter how tough it is.  we need to hear it.  hugs!!
amen sister. we need so many more like you.
amen sister! you are an amazing american treasure! thank you for standing up and speaking out! this is more than infuriating and heartbreaking. simper fidelis! praying for your friends.  tp
may this message be saved  stored  found and broadcast to those that ask... what happen to america
im so glad to finally hear someone with a channel that has influence say these things!thank you!
sometimes you just need to hear a message on repeat. this is one of those times. thank you for speaking truth. god bless.
thank you so much for all that you do! in these dark times  your videos bring me hope and renewed determination! it is so encouraging to know there are many likeminded people who still hold bible truths and patriotism as priceless jewels! god bless you mightily!
praise yah! thank you for your post. it spoke deeply to me as i feel so alone in all of this. but i know the only thing that matters is hearing those words  well done . nothing else matters. supporting our jewish brothers and sisters and remaining faithful to his word and his chosen people and land no matter what. thank you  his shalom lavonne.
thank you for sharing such a sensitive personal story that is a direct affect of the lack of proper leadership in our country today. you express the passion and common sense that most of the younger generations don t understand. they are too comfortable in the chairs playing their games and following the politician off the cliff. thank you for all you do. i hope your friend and his wife are okay. prayers for healing and comfort for them.
you are absolutely right. america is heading for judgement. god bless you for sharing this.
no matter how difficult it gets  keep on speaking the truth. you are in my prayers.
the word.... patriot nurse! we also see what s coming and understand  for some time now  the level of corruption in our environment. thanks for the share  sympathies for david and rebecca.... semper fi.
yes  you have really  put it out there today .  i love your intellect  passion and most of all your faith and courage to speak the obvious which most people don t want to even acknowledge let alone vocalize.  i believe that there is a spirit of oppression to free speech because i notice that whenever i even venture to go beyond small talk people just get a glazed over look and shut down and vacate the conversation with a distraction they suddenly have.  it is sickening.  love and prayers.
you and southern prepper 1 were on point today and speaking heavy truth . i am not looking forward for what s coming but only asking for the strength courage patience and wisdom to persevere . god bless you pn .
love listening to you. you hit the nail on the head.
it s deliberate what our  government   is doing
funny thing here.  in 1945  both of my grandparents were living in the tularosa basin.  what is important about that is that it s east of the trinity site where the first atomic bomb was detonated.  family stories include them being up early one morning getting ready for work and noticing that not only was the sun rising well before sunrise was supposed to occur  it was rising in the west.  my grandparents almost certainly caught some of the fallout.fast forward about fifty years and my grandfather was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer.  they removed his kidney.  months or years later  i was just a young child at the time  so the time elapsed isn t something i paid attention to  and there was another diagnosis  the cancer had metastasized to his lung.  they removed part of that.  then again  months or years later  my grandfather started losing his balance.  it has metastasized to his brain.  they tried chemo  radiation  everything.  nothing worked.  i remember my dad driving me home from the hospital one night and that s when it struck me.  i realized that there was nothing that anybody could do to save my grandfather.  things went downhill after that.  my grandfather s health continued to decline to the point where hospice was called in so that he could die at home.  what followed was months of me watching this man who was tougher than iron waste away.  his mind eventually was gone  and at times he didn t even realize he was ill.  eventually  he had a moment of lucidity and realized he was dying and he just let go  and it was over.by the time the funeral services rolled around  the family was more chipper than we had been in months.  it made me think  why are we smiling when i genuinely loved my grandfather   the answer is simple.  the husk that was wasting away wasn t really my grandfather.  there were bits and pieces of him in there  but it wasn t him.  we had already mourned his passing.  we had already accepted it.  a few short years later  my grandmother was diagnosed with the same rare kidney cancer.i accepted and mourned the passing of this country years ago.  it is terminal and there are bits and pieces of what it once was  but this is not the united states of america anymore.  we live in interesting times.
this was very informative  honest and mind moving. thank you.
can you go live with your daughter  my daughter would have me move in with her today if i wanted...
i just said a prayer for you southern momma
prayers for you and your daughter
praying for you. god bless.
@dena c  wow! that was a lot! thank you. i m going to read it again   again!
@haveyouflossedtoday  unfortunately not.
@cluckies chickens  she doesn t have room.
i read so many stories like this and it s heartbreaking. i live alone  am 56  a conservative christian woman  my home is paid for and i have enough land for a nice size garden  i live on the edge of a forest with wildlife  lakes for fish and water  a wood stove and am an unemployed nurse. when things fall apart i will be prepared for others as we will be able to work together to survive. i say all this because there are probably like minded people or people willing to go together and buy a piece of property that you can all work to garden  preserve food  put up wood and maybe raise a few livestock. so many people are struggling  living in fear and suffering alone but if we would group together and work together we could survive these days ahead. i pray you could find some good honest hardworking people to pool resources and maybe start a homestead  we are headed for some really tough times i think and now is the time to prepare !god bless you !
praying for you.
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  this would be my dream.
hang on...keep the faith! gods timing...put your eyes on him   grow closer to him. prayers your way .
@proud southern momma!       may god bless you and protect you sister
for posterity!
sadly not that i am aware of. if you download it  it will only play back in you tube.  if there is a way  please post so i could save to hard drive to be played in another video player.  i have begun to do the same with other formats regarding first aid  gardening  and the like so even if the  cloud  fails  i can still view info.
s o r o s
let s talk now i have something bigger to introduce  ......
we are under judgement and have been for years.
there is no question in my mind. that it s going to get very bad here soon.sadly most oh the organized church says  peace and safty that is our que.
@marvin wenger  yep  the organized church says   no worries. we re all gona get raptured  i often wonder if our brother and sisters in christ who live under terrible persecution think they are going through th tribulation. the west hasn t seen suffering  better buckle up!
@deborah   amen. i agree. we will face it just like the bible says. the real test is when the persecution comes. who will stand and who will fall. sounds to me like the  great falling away.
@deborah  we re looking for a church right now. hubby s ready to join the first one we visited. your comment really makes me think about the rapture issue. i don t think we ll find one that has everything we want but that should be a top priority. if the pastor doesn t even know we re gonna go through some stuff he s not gonna lead us through it well.
@laura nilsen  i so agree with you  we live in a rural area and the pickings are slim believe me. the church we were going to won t discuss prophecy because it s too controversial. i said what   i ve had to stop going for now because  well i can t take it anymore. there is pastor ortize from calvary spokane but as for a building in our little area it s just not happening. god bless your search! i m listening online for now. the lord knows!
@deborah    the church i attend with my husband doesn t talk about what is going on in the world  it s the only church i can get him to go to.  i do know what s going on and if i slip and make a comment at church to with some of the members they look at me like i m nuts.  they have no idea.
@lynn schantz  i ve had the same experience or they just smile like  poor thing . it just got depressing to go to church and be surrounded by people who are asleep. our pastor was a little sarcastic and angry and then the air fresheners were giving me migraines so yay! hubby finally said we could leave. prob is now we can t agree on where to go.
@deborah  thank you! it s tough. i d really love to just meet with a small group of like-minded people. i m scared to death we re gonna end up in a lukewarm church cause my sweet husband is sooo loyal and we ll be there a long long time.
@lynn schantz  lynn i say it anyway  let them think i m a nut. i have tried but it s like ramming my head into a brick wall. these people enjoy being comfortably numb. don t worry what people think  we will answer to god. i agree a small group would be optimal.
truth must be spoken. those who have the ears to hear  are listening. god bless all of his children. wake up  now.
america has been in judgement fro a long time
@marvin wenger  did you see the news today about the shooting at the christian elementry school  6 killed by a woman who went to the school who identified as a male. my thought is she killed because as a child she wanted to be a boy and christians didn t take her seriously. here we go
@deborah  exactly!its going to hit like a real surprise when they are still here s d persecution is going on.
@lynn schantz  find some fellow christians   have talks at someone s home   about we re we are at in the world     definitely where we are headed   read  study    pray!!! maybe will help!!!
@laura nilsen  don t depend on any pastor to lead you through anything .follow the holy spirit .
@lisa wilson  oh i m def not depending on any pastor.
@lizzz  i think i ll just pray with him. thanks for your concern. you re welcome to pray for our marriage.
amen and amen..agree
amen...agree
what do you think that we have been going through for the last couple of years
@tammy rogers  yes i agree with you but i think there is far worse coming.
amen  yes!!!
yes  100
it s a crime syndicate.
but why    that s the big question
nwo
my 3 favorite women to watch when it comes to current events .. patriot nurse squirrel tribe and jennifer lafontaine....excellent
we re already being judged. we haven t learned by chief seattle s prophetic words  there for we re going through what he and his people went through.
a  video!very helpful for understanding the current political climate  especially for those who are leaders and need to understand what is happening.
i feel the same way here in canada.  the reason why we have such awful narcissistic politicians like justin trudeau and chrystia freeland is because canadians  collectively  effectively   want  them there.  complacency  decadence  and ignorance are rampant.  i agree there will be a reckoning for us all.
for the sterns and y all to be able to continue yalls mission. blessings  julie
love it!! keep preaching sister
powerful words. thank you. i ve been praying and preparing for a year. i stand in agreement with you.
i put in my time as a soldier defending in countries where we had no business being. i returned unharmed  but i am sad for the loss of your friend. i will honor his memory as a brother in arms - hoorah. yes the united states as we know it will soon feel the judgement of god. as followers of the lord  we need to get prepared for whats coming. i pray for you and other pratriots around the country. may the lord bless you and yours. buckle up - its going to be a bumby ride!
a fresh focus for sure ..you speak the truth and it s reassuring to hear you verbalize the things that we all know in our hearts to be true. you enable me to be more confident in my dialogue when interacting with those who seem ignorant and or blind to the reality of these issues. all the glory to god! thanks patriot nurse.
praise be to y shua! as a jew and an american patriot and combat veteran of vietnam  i humbly thank you for this video and what you said! god bless you  sister!
amen  i wish there were more women like you   i wish my ex wife would listen for our 4 children s sake but sadly no luck there  but i love to see the fire in people who know the truth and are about it   god bless you in jesus name
listening to you reminded me of yesterday i opened the bible and was reading book of esther around the part where mordecai had a dream.  the dream is about two dragons rearing up for a huge war.  the atmosphere was dark and gloomy and the earth shook so strong.  the just on the earth were in fear of the impending evil that was about to befall them all.  the just called upon god exceedingly and then....  a spring of water flowed like a river and the sky parted to a point to reveal a shining and glorious light in response to the prayers of the just..  this was the dream of mordecai in the book of esther.   i believe this dream is about the times we are in now.
i bring a witness to this word. judgment is at the door.. we need to repent and choose this day whom we will serve. no more limping between two opinions. great word patriot nurse  this is the prophetic word. felt the spirit of jeremiah
how could  the battle of armageddon come to be if someone  possibly the federal government  wasn t going around bashing every hornets nest they come across  it s all in god s hands! i love my country  i love my countrymen! i m ashamed of what our government has become  and has allowed to become.
amen sister! we must seek the father s work above all else. i thank you for your constitutial stand. may god continue to bless you in your efforts.
dear lady  i have never heard the truth spoken better. i believe your legacy will be the  truth .
thank you for being real and sharing this   so sorry about your friends  i did have a dream that a huge fist came and hit the earth and it was do loud it woke me up so yes judgment is coming god bless
thank you so much for always telling it like it is and where we should all be headed.  we need to get to praying harder and getting god into our heart  mind and soul on a much stronger basis.  thanks for staying in the fight  don t give up.
yes ma am  this is exactly what we deserve! we will  as a whole  need to be  taught  the error of our ways. we can not cast our papers once every 4 years  not vote with our religious views in mind   then allow our elected leaders to go about unchallenged.
well stated. total affirmation of what i ve been feeling for a long time.
fellow canadian  retribution will come for those who ve slighted those with moral principles and those without will reap the seeds of chaos they ve passively sewn.oi ain t dying for the country as i m a young man  and most definitely will not support or maintain a society that claims i m toxic when i m not needed. naw  i ll build when it s all ash and rubble cuz only by a cleanse with fire will there be possibility of proper moral foundations to be laid and society to be built on
we re in this together brother. god made man....the country each one is in is insignificant. we are all going to be judged and feel god s wrath very soon.
if voting really counted do you think they would let us vote  mark twain..
a side note  this girl has had a dosage cheat sheet taped to the wall in the back of my bus the last 20 yrs. as a medic  and mocked by my peers thoroughly for it. so glad you confirmed my fetish for readily available and tangible guidance when it counts vs  the cloud . relying on the internet in the moment bit me in the butt only once. never let a mistake go to waste. live and learn and do what s required to prevent it from happening again.
thank you for your service  and for being counted as a fellow patriot. i m almost 67 years old and don t even recognize this once great god fearing country. i keep my focus on things above  because this old world is not my home. i am  however  very disturbed by our government interfering in israel  gods land. what a stark difference between the current administration and past leaders who held israel in very high regard  and had an allegiance with the country and its people.
one vet to another- thank you sir for your service to the once greatest nation on god s earth!
amen
agreed!!!
amen
@thepatriotnurse  i will add it is going to get a lot worse before the end. rev 16 15-16 is when christ 2nd coming happens and we are his army that go to the war and destroy the world nations attacking gods land and people. just understand this is all gods plan it is going to happen no matter what for whatever purpose god has.
had a strong urge to reply  i couldn t write a reply with a thousand words as perfectly as you did in 18.
@brian johnson  thank you  brian. when you feel the urge to make a comment  please do so!  i for one enjoy reading comments and we never know when we may say something that is just what another person needs to hear. again thank you.
repent  for the kingdom of yahuah is near!!! 2 chronicles 7 14.
the people have become far too acquiescent.
very thankful i saw this video this morning  doing our best to be wise with the times in preparedness. i have a request. i stayed up with you during the night watches of prayer   fasting when you read   proclaimed scripture in hebrew. it was so beautiful   powerful. would you consider making a series of hebrew prayers with pauses so we could pronounce it after you  i know you re a busy lady and you could keep each at 8 minutes or whatever you feel led to do. i love 8 because of kay arthur s  covenant  study where she shows it is the number of covenant. do what you feel led to do. lead us in scripture prayer where we can say it after you or with you. blessings sister. onward christian soldiers as the song says.
i hope you are healing well pn  we all appreciate and admire what you do here my fellow patriot  stay strong and faithful!
i m so sorry your friend had to go through that  it s betrayal at the highest level which is soul crushing
little sister   curse  is exactly what came to mind in prayer this morning. how do you convince an ungodly tribe they are under a curse  your observations are always spot on. fellow citizens if you don t have jesus now is the time.
very well said! learn people! learn natural remedies!
thank you for truth pn. i am so sorry that your friends had to endure such a horrible situation.
love you sister thanks for always speaking the truth here.
our government is too busy taking care of the world and not concentrating on giving attention to where it s needed in our own country while the americans do without
you speak the truth!  thank you and stand strong  prayers for you.
great job with this one! i saw the account of your marine friend and thank the lord for sparing their lives. and you are spot on with this nation s corrupt government. judgement is falling  saints prepare for the worst to come until his return! god bless you!
thank you for sharing this .i ve been sharing as much as i could to try and help reach and wake as many as i could up since about 2017  and remind us that we truly have been born for a time such as this our own foundation has got to be strong to withstand the shifting and crumbling of everything around us   it s definitely coming in hot  it s imperative that we get right within ourselves in knowing feeling seeing our one true god and not they re little g  god   there is only one big g and they re little g ain t  it.  never has been and never will be   .  we stand united with the armor of god on at the ready
you said it sister!!!thanks for getting the word out!
as usual  pn  you hit the center of the bullseye.  you tell it just like it is.  sadly  i believe that  americans are about to learn the true meaning of  weeping and gnashing of teeth   because  what goes around  comes around .
very well said. excellent message. residents of our household share your opinion 100 .
thank-you for your clear headed words and standing up for your friends!!
i can t help but be moved to pray as i watch your more serious videos such as this one.  i pray for you pn and i pray for people to hear your words!  bless you all for being here together.
thank you for speaking up. you re always on the front line.
condolences for the loss of your friend patriot nurse! godspeed in your calling to help us understand this corrupt culture and nation!!
with big tech censorship and tyranny against conservative content creators  please remember to press that like and share button folks  help us spread the word!!!
i told a junior associate to reference a surgery text to review a particular surgical technique  and she looked at me with utter confusion.
i pray all the time  however we all know that there will be no devine intervention. the jews  native americans  etc never had any god rescue them.
@d3riverbrat  agreed. stay strong friend.
@dave todd  you bet! when i go down  it will be fighting and not hiding under the bed. my dna is just that way. god bless you!
god will intervene for the nation of israel. the people will not win the ezekiel 38-39 war that s coming  it will be god. everyone will know it.
we are to take care of our household first  always.
same herein the uk
we re not taking care of the world. we re making it a worse place.
@pondimus maximus  we are not  but the powers that be  all by design. same club that is doing this  has infected all governments.
@theoutdoorsman  yes  you re 100  right. i should have been more clear.
on purpose
make ukraine a us state  so we can tap into their abundance of natural resources and recover some of the billions of hush money joey is sending them!

i find it interesting how our replies end up removed. sharing where i can  brother.
the first thing i do
@the truth  my comments get shadowbanned constantly...
@isaac  persistence can never be fully silenced.
@the truth  amen to that.
hey truth
@the truth  they remove mine too. gotta go old school. get loud people.
you totally have hit the nail on the head with many vids you do but this is 2000 percent!
i m sorry for the loss of your beautiful friends patriot nurse. thank you for all you do  god bless!
i absolutely love the strength and power you carry.
absolutely atrocious. praise yah they re ok! i completely agree with everything you say. thank you so much for speaking out!
within catholic circles  to which i belong  there is a strong prophetic pulse that what you have said  patriot nurse  will happen if we do not amend our ways as a nation. the lord god will not be mocked. i will keep you and your ministry in my prayers.
we must unite in prayer and educate. set an example of preparedness. help and stand together.
preach it. i wish i was able to carry at work  but i work in a state building that won t let me carry. i hate it. i have carried everywhere for 5  years now. i have not been able to drill because i just moved to a new area and haven t found a place to shoot yet. but i will. i have reference books on hand. i am keeping the important non- fiction and discarding the fiction. my mother loves gardening and sewing  and my dad is a builder carpenter that can put anything together. i provide the cooking skills and bullets and  as i am the only one who successfully completed several semesters in nursing school  basic anatomy  medical terms  microbiology  phlebotomy  bandaging tourniquet  nursing math  etc    i take on that role as well. we do what we can.
i thank god for his protection of your friends and our hero s.  many of us have been defending our initially formed constitutional republic for many years in one way or another.  many have been persecuted for their efforts.  this will continue.  we must stay the course and lean not on our own understanding  but his.thank you for your message.  we and friends were just speaking about john adams quote a few days ago.  we truly are on the cusp of a great shaking judgement  spiritual  moral  financial  criminal  suffering.  prepare  train and firstly  draw near to our father  son and holy spirit.  in god only we trust.
blessings from alaska praying for you and family  glad to see you in good health again
patriot nurse i felt it proper to leave this as a separate comment  i am so terribly sorry for your loss sister
john adams was definitely correct. we recognize no sovereign but god  and no king but jesus!  u.s. founder
so much truth in a short video.  thank you.
i pray that everyone that gets this video listen as long as it takes for the message to sink in. thank you for clearing the air. blessings gary
condolences to you your family and your friend s family. sorry for the loss.
i usually don t comment because i watch youtube on my tv and it does not have that option. when i saw this video i had to let you know how moving it was. i cried  i was angry  i was pissed off at what happened to your friend. it breaks my heart.he and his family are in my prayers.i will never understand how people can be so hate filled and evil against someone they don t even know. i completely agree with you on your views concerning what has happened to our country. this world is coming to it s end. i will be glad.g_d bless you for taking your time to make your videos. they are uplifting and inspirational.
i could not agree more with your patriot nurse  thank you and god bless you.
woohoo! love your energy and brains!  thanks a ton for all that you do pn!the downfall of the us has been scripted  and now we just wait for god s judgement on this country  it is near.
very  very well said  and thank you for all you have done for all of us with open ears  and prayers for your friend and his family.. god is coming for his people...stay prayed up!!! and god bless you!!
i m so sorry to hear of your friend. i am ashamed  disgusting and broken hearted at the state of our nation. the lord is calling and preparing his people.
i love the honesty and truth you present!
hey walter
@d3riverbrat   old school is the only way to go.
@the truth  they will never ever tell me to shut the hell up! i am an american! god bless you my friend and let your voice be heard!
@d3riverbrat  always and forever.
@the truth  together we stand brother!
i m saying a 54 day rosary novena for our country. every little bit helps!
pray the 24 hours of the passion of our lord   every day  these are reparation prayers.
please be careful the truth is not appreciated  but i appreciate you and the pain is bad!
@babsbarbs  god bless  1 timothy 6 12 kjv
you took the words right out of my mouth  good on you!
you are awesome thank you for your hard work and i m so sorry for your our loss. god bless you!
you sound like one of us marines  pn! old school ones  that is. not the ones that have to sit through dei training nowadays. i learned that  being a disabled veteran  that i must praise the lord jesus every day  even through all my physical and financial struggle. i have a super loving wife  who was also a nurse  and still has all her books!  that is also fully aware of everything going on. god bless y all
speaking the truth. heartbreaking. pressing in.
love all your videos! one question i ve been pondering  how long before they bring back the draft  to cover the military deficit we have
i am so sorry for the loss of such a good man  i know that pain  it s especially more painful when you know what kind of government we have  and we need to pray for all our military an extra protection from the evil that has taken over our country. hugs sweety
regardless of what happens i think war will be part of it! man i honestly didn t see this part in my life. i did see the bible playing out as it has throughout my life. and jesus returning for a 1000 year of peace. i sure would love to be included in that!! and fighting in the battle with our lord. i look forward to that too! god bless you patriot nurse. we appreciate all your contributions in this day. much love.
this is one of your best videos so far. i agree w you 100 . may god bless you for speaking the truth.
i went thru all of those mental health issues. feel like nothing surprises or shocks me anymore.  my fam looked at me as a ct..conspiracy theorist...we are now on the same page. may the good lord help us.
one of the best people i listen to!! its not a promo  or a dooms day.  you say what s in your heart
i am so sorry about your friends. praise the lord for people like you that speak out and stand firm in the faith.
thank you for this video and the information shared! prayers for david  his wife rachel  their family  and all in harms way! yes  judgement is coming and in a way has already began as our great god has removed his protection from us   is allowing us to suffer the consequences of the evil our nation has endorsed   embarked upon! we have been so greatly blessed and to whom much is given much is expected! the first and most important on our preparation list needs to be the preparing of our hearts- 2 chronicles 12 14 and he  king rehoboam  did evil  because he did not prepare his heart to seek the lord.2 chronicles 19 3 3however  some good is found in you  for you have removed the asherah poles from the land and have set your heart on seeking god.    1 samuel 7 3then samuel said to all the house of israel   if you are returning to the lord with all your hearts  then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and ashtoreths among you  prepare your hearts for the lord  and serve him only. and he will deliver you from the hand of the philistines. ezra 7 10for ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord  and to do it  and to teach in israel statutes and judgments.1 chronicles 29  david s prayer of blessing 18o lord  god of our fathers abraham  isaac  and israel  keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts of your people  and direct their hearts toward you. 19and give my son solomon a whole heart to keep and carry out all your commandments  decrees  and statutes  and to build your palace for which i have made provision. psalm 78  7that they should put their confidence in god  not forgetting his works  but keeping his commandments. 8then they will not be like their fathers  a stubborn and rebellious generation  whose heart was not loyal  whose spirit was not faithful to godpsalm 57  7 my heart is steadfast  god  my heart is steadfast  i will sing  yes  i will sing praises!2 chronicles 20  33the high places  however  were not removed  the people had not yet set their hearts on the god of their fathersjeremiah 12  2you planted them  and they have taken root. they have grown and produced fruit. you are ever on their lips  but far from their hearts. 3but you know me  o lord  you see me and test my heart toward you.jeremiah 11 20o lord of hosts  who judges righteously  who examines the heart and mind  let me see your vengeance upon them  for to you i have committed my cause.2 kings 20 3i beseech thee  o lord  remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart  and have done that which is good in thy sight. and hezekiah wept sore.job 11 13  if you would prepare your heart  and stretch out your hands toward him     seek the lord  prepare your heart  rest your faith in him and he will keep you in perfect peace through the storm!
amen and amen  thank you i needed that rant. i hope the lord comes to get us soon sister  no more darkness only light. thank you god bless you.
thank you. your message was heard  and appreciated.
i get no pleasure in agreeing with you 100  it saddens me greatly to see the young people today at work that have no idea what s about to happen to them. they are wholly godless mostly immoral and are living through the time that they will sadly remember as  the good old days  and it breaks my heart for them. thanks for your passion  facts and faith. god bless !!
thank you for sharing the truth of our predicament.   may the father s remnant be found faithful to the end.
we reject and resist evil. we overcome evil with good. be prepared with food  supplies  and as far as medicine  we should not count on meds from cvs because soon enough that will be gone. have reference books on plants  gardening  herbs  foraging  and the lost ways of creating medicine from the plants all around us. i m starting that now. god bless you patriot nurse. hoping to take a class soon.
right on sister  my wife is a long-time nurse. icu  i love ya all. like   thanks. barb was a navy corpsman   me a jarhead.the combo has worked for almost 40 years. i am concerned. be blessed
thank you for your truth and passion.
we are indeed headed for severe judgement  and it is going to be extremely hard for the believers as well. but we need to keep our faith  and stick together however we can  and pray that we can weather the storm. evil will perish  at the expense of many. god bless you all that believe in the almighty.
semper fi devil dog.  thanks for your service.  you made a very profound comment here.
god bless and keep you sir! gos save us from these demonic criminals in government!

preaching to the choir!  you are right on my friend.  you are a true blessing and a godly voice of reason in a corrupt world.  prayers with you always.
in my opinion this is quite possibly the most timely thought pervocing and truth saying video  i have seen in a long time
i have listened to you for years.. i do what i can to prepare...  my husband did 33 years in the air force 10 active the rest reserve.. and now  no retirement just a honorary discharge because he didnt reenlist and made aware of this with a letter dated last september and only delivered 3 weeks ago. no retirement check and now currently unemployed with health issues       i pray for my nation  america and my family and israel with my heart!    america  repent!!!! get ready!!!
god bless the patriot nurse
girl  we definitely speakin the same language. i m 69 next month and been watchin this simmering for 40 years. it eventually cost me my marriage of 25 years. she just couldn t look past her career and her personal goals. she wasn t happy  and i wouldn t couldn t change to make her happy. very unfortunate
patriot nurse we are not headed for judgment  we are in the midst of full blown judgment. don t worry about the sheep let s just worry about waking up the lions
good job girl as always

rev.14 6-8  the hour of his judgment is come. that end time prophecy of daniel s 2300 years  day  ended in 1844. study the sanctuary
i think we are babylon
midst of full blown judgement   i m not trying to be confrontational to you personally  but let me say that you ain t seen nothing yet. i think you are in for a shock. i m in for a shock too  and i m fully expecting the coming judgement. i don t think any of us have any clue just how bad that judgment will be and the coming horrors on this earth. there are scriptures that give a little peek  but reading and living through  or dying in  are two different things.
@christocr  do you think there is any chance in the world that we would raptured or is that just a pipe dream. i used to think i had the answer to that but not anymore.
our son and son-in-law did 2 tour s at the same time and never saw each other in afghanistan and saw so much of that we just shook our heads and wonder what they and their brother s in arms went through and just give thanks to our lord for bringing them back to us safe we will always be grateful to our military forever owe them our lives and freedom wwg1wga                  god bless our military  veterans and america thank you all for y all s service and our brave one s thank gave all

absolutely priceless content we have enter a evil season   to the government and there friends everything  for us the people the law a people that have turned there back on our father yahweh  can not expect his protection  and his finger of protection has been lifted . like it or not truth is here   the truth has no agenda it s just the truth hosea 4 6 knowledge seek it
facts! all facts!  i could not have said it any better.
agree completely with your conviction. also in my opinion just the name tick tock should tell the story on why to stay away from that platform.
keep telling the truth! god bless you!
spot on pn!!!love the channel!    true patriot till the end!great advice for everyone  be safe!!!!bless you!!!!you will be judged and you will easily pass judgment  don t worry !
be strong  spread love   and no fear.
i like this one very much. sorry about your friend and his wife prayed for both of them.
thank you for sharing these truths.
i know things will get worse  and they have been for years -- it started around the late 1860s if we re honest. but i d be stressed out to the point of uselessness if i had to hear your predictions on a regular basis. i appreciate people who know and who help others to know  really. and i appreciate the work you do. but stress comes across in your videos. i hope for your sake that you take some time to do some of the more enjoyable things god has gifted you with. he gave us humor and comfort in our faith for a reason  and i don t think enough christians consider how much of a help to ourselves and this old world that can be.
you are amazing. my prayers for  david.
i m so sorry your friend and his wife were involved in this horrific attack. our world is past the point of anything that resembles a moral people. there is no logic to any of this. the nation is dead. you are 100  correct. there are pockets of god fearing believers that are joining together. they are homeschooling  planting  raising livestock  raising children and working together to make it through this tribulation that is upon us. nine of us ladies joined together today to bond in our pursuit of being the hands and feet of yeshua. we had the opportunity to pray for two members of our gathering group. pray for each other daily. we must get prepared for a world where we will no longer be able to buy   sell. please prepare so you can help others  shalom.
gonna read all the links!   thanks for laying it out and not holding back!
prepper nurse you are definitely full of the spirit and agree 100  of what your laying down  semper fi!
perfect perception.... reality.i love your conviction. it cannot be denied.  very sorry about your friend.may god bless all connected to your friends  family  and yours.god help us all....
amen  in the us back then  at 12 years old we were presented our 1st ballistic piece. this is unbelievable  and horrible.  it is a birthright for us.
am n  am n and am n!  great teachings from a stalwart teacher. you hit all the nails squarely on the head! blessings upon you and all the faithful of the lord! we must ve ever watchful and ready to serve  protect  and continue to prepare  until he comes  and we hear him say  the work is done!
pn you are 100  right. this country is in big trouble. you are so right about this government. there is so much evil that is going on. and you do not mess with gods chosen people. things are are going down fast. god does see everything. keep praying. wonderful video.
straight forward truth!! awesome message!! u nailed it..summed up perfectly. mankind better get integrity and morality back in their lives immediately as the doom is upon us already. humanity is splitting in two..either evolve or devolve..
what s sad  even more would vote for again ! it s game over   enjoy your time left in freedom.
not just this administration. every administration. we ve had 1 good president in the last 120 years.
@conservitarian 17  kennedy  reagan  trump
nixon took us off the gold standard in 71. after that the dollar would only last 50 years. well here we are.
@james woenker  kennedy was half baked  reagan helped destroy the economy and pushed gun control  trump i m waiting on  his first term was meh in most areas.
@jon b  that s what allowed the fed to get us in the gutter we re in now.
@ironmike  yes it s been set up since 1906
@conservitarian 17  so who was the one
i m very interested
great episode pn.        thank you for your red pilling. my heart goes out to you  dave  rachel  their friends and families.i m a u.s. veteran and i m absolutely disgusted with what the politicians have done and what the people have allowed. we re a fat  lazy  disgusting  slovenly  entitled  spoiled  decadent  obese people. this is not what me  my brothers and sisters sacrificed for.we all deserve what we re willing to tolerate. we all got what we wanted now let s see if we want what we re about to get.take care of yourself  stay strapped  and watch your six. the fall of rome is upon us.
yah s will be done  thank you and prayers for your marine friend and wife.... shalom
prayers to all during this time of evil.
thank you  for speaking truth.
the good news is jesus christ  and that there is amazing life after death you guys  i ve been watching a lot of nde s and i m astounded! god has used it to completely heal me of my fear of death! i love all of you!! thank you pn!
god bless you  patriot nurse.  i hear you.  love from canada.  we have our own tyrant here in canada!
was just sitting here before i started this video and all that i heard were these words-fear god and give him praise. pn- you already are a good and faithful servant sister. and although that is what you want to hear from him as do i. just you speaking out here is good work. you didn t have to say anything and yet you are trying to help people be as prepared for whatever may come as they can be.
many thanks for your up tone ness god gave good sense to be used everyday some ppl are good sense challenged!!rock steady pn
so absolutely true!  well stated by ray dalio in his  big cycle  and often in the scriptures as the  pride cycle . we are on the collapsing side of this curve. we have forgotten god in this country in our softness and  life of luxury  and until we humble ourselves and return in supplication asking for his forgiving mercy. prepare - spiritually and temporally.  love one another!
preach it sister.
g mornin. i ve come to a point of realization that although my eternal status is secure  my earthly state would take only one hard  practical shake to set me up for a quicker eternal state than i think i m meant for. i m not in any position to store  grow  arm  or otherwise prep. my career is otr. my family is not available. i m not what you d call afraid... just feeling the overall sense of changing winds in the sense of imminent judgment on the usa. soooo.... where do i go from here  where do i connect  i ve no home church and am wary to jump and trust without test. any solid suggestions will be greatly appreciated !
thank you for the message. i need someone by my side like you in these times.
so sorry to hear about your friend. it is terrible to witness the changes in humanity. to hear they just filmed him is so vile. spiritual preperation is the most important item to have in preparedness  kit   for sure. our walk with god is the key to surviving in this life  but more importantly the life to come. you are right  faith is an action word. odedience to god is paramount. the fear of god is the key to our eternal outcome. we serve a might god who is able to help us prepare for what is coming when we seek his guidance. we can hear his voice to know what we each need to do  and should they rob us of all our goods we serve a mighty god who feeds his people in the wilderness. he does win. we just need to endure to our end whatever that is and be found on his side.
i am so sorry to hear about your friend! god be with you and his family!
thank you for sharing the truth
i appreciate you  thank you for what you do for us. as for the world of politics l have nothing for it but a rope and a stout tree! always  farmer john

well said. thank you sister  from a fellow patriot and true believer.

excellent video and thank you !
glad that you understand what has and is happening
well said on all points. we can only pray that the remnant in this country will still fall under god s protection.  and talking about the ambassador situation - after benghazi  nothing surprises me. we are being led by people who hate our country.
amen sister! maranatha!
blessings withheld from this promised land.  god bless you for bringing this out. truly this nation has fallen!
so thankful for you!!!
thank you patriot nurse!
keep speaking the truth  sister...
praise you father for revealing truth and guiding us through this time.  keep us strong  our eyes  heart and soul on you the lord jesus christ.
wow  love this vid. you ve come a long way since  rockin  those sunglasses a decade ago  your the reason i carry a big ass medical sachel with me on every protection assignment i m involved with in the security field.    thank you
common sense always comes from the patriot nurse! thank you for sharing!
may god love and keep you. thank you for all of your time  information  experience  and love.
i spent some time meditating on daniel chapter 5 recently.    i think think various western governments  especially the usa  are behaving as belshazzar did.     i think for ezekiel 38 and 39 to come to fruition  the us hegemon must end.  you are absolutely correct in your assessment.   every old time scholar of eschatology that i have heard preach on the subject of the last days said that the united states is not mentioned in end times prophecy  with the exception of those who identify the usa as mystery babylon  and her fate is obliteration.     considering our behaviors and that of our government and that of others nations in our sphere of influence  as well as the apparent path the world is traveling  i expect that the usa will suffer the fate of all empires of the past.    i believe god s word  and it will happen as he has seen and said  for god s word is the truth.
violence  naked force has settled more issues in history than has any other factor  and the contrary opinion is wishful thinking at its worst.  breeds that forget this basic truth have always paid for it with their lives and freedoms.     robert heinlein
amen your so true patriot  nurse
in the words of hillary    what difference does it make   should tell you all how and what they think of us. i m sorry about your friend and hope he recovers.  god bless and always remember  winter is coming.
girl you spanked this one.thank you god bless
i never thought in a million years we d be where we are today. i m glad we see it coming. i m sure that first nations have their own stories to tell about what it means to be in their way. and now they do this to their own people.
100 truth! father have mercy on your people open their eyes and hearts to you.
you go  i ve never seen you so livid! it s all coming down   well done my good and faithful servant!  you are most definitely written in the lambs book of life!  god bless and protect you my sister. i love and appreciate you and all you are standing for. the light!
i ve been feeling that the time of the father s forbearance has long expired. it is only by his grace that we have made it this far. i pray that somehow this nation will wake up and repent before it s too late.
1000  agree. and thanks for sharing
praise yah  david and his family are ok.  we know david  he is one of the nicest guys you would ever meet.
one of your best.  thank you for your truth
god be with you sister.. your appreciated!!
i will be sharing this one for sure!  i keep reminding my family and friends that we can t fix our country until our soft children are required to do hard things. i also tell my children that i don t care how they find god  just that they find him.    sorry  trying to keep it short. thank you for sharing your straightforward truth.
i am sorry to hear about your friends. god bless you. you have spoke nothing but the truth.
i thank you pn . i miss you and thank you for your prayers and encouragement. thank you.
you go girl!  shalom to you and yours and a blessed passover
praying for your friends in isrial
i use to think we were a giving and moral country when dealing with the world  then iraq happened in my life and my whole outlook of our government and how it truly is war mongers and thieves of other countries resources. im convinced that this world is run by evil men  it s no wonder that half the world hates america. it truly is sad and makes my heart hurt.
bless you sister!
amen  i am with you . i agree with you whole heartedly.  i want to be found a good and faithful servant also. i am so sorry for what happened to  your friend.  we have to be strong . prepared and pray.
you are so right missy...

it was a legit miracle. that s so cool you know him!
both yall do seminars   what are a few good ways to house and feed group participant gatherings such as during these multi day events  if one were so inclined to do so
i m still so impressed how he stayed in the fight and returned rounds and striking the enemy  all after getting shot himself.definitely a marine no doubt about it!
well thank you mr dinosaur!have been way busy training cqc  to advantage family members and with rapid success! my sister a crippled veteran nearly 60  bested a multiple attack in her driveway on wednesday. had to bail her outa jail...as they say  you can beat the rap...but you can t beat the rideso proud to know my daddys blood still strong in her! he beached normandy  on the 4th day. lots of bodies piled up by then. his sharpshooter skills were widely appreciated as wolfpacks were the rear guard of retreating forces. he is laughin upstairs  at the stunts his kids are still pullin  some good  some not so good.of course  as his 47th birthday present  he had to name me david lots of us prefer the fray  as the lord so leads. discipline is
thank you for your service. i m glad that i was born in the usa. i consider myself very very lucky that people defend the red white and blue with their blood. i m afraid of the fray . so your service to me and for my freedom is very precious to me. thank god for y all!   see you on the other side. please stay safe!
the curses of deuteronomy2 8 are now on the ppl who have benefited as the ruling class

@civilization means domestication..... live free  i will look thank you
hosea 2 16 and it shall be at that day  saith the lord  that thou shalt call me ishi  and shalt call me no more baali. king james versionyah is not mentioned i m good!!!
i was cleaning up for passover and listening to this video going  yep   yep   amen sister  and giving you high fives. so spot on. yah is calling us to prepare and get ready more than anything we just be ready in the spirit. love this channel. keep going sister. you are voicing what many are feeling in the spirit
patriot nurse we appreciate your voice of truth and your passion for liberty and faith in god. please be safe in this crazy world and get out of babylon if you havent already. you and others like you  need to survive the appocalyptic events that are coming so that we can have your strength and wisdom to help in rebuilding america.  god bless
thank you for this wonderful video.  i pray that your friend heals and that he and his wife remain in god s hands and under his protection. your words are so incredibly honest and true.  many of the words you used  i have said to family members and many of them think i have anger issues.  well  at age 10 i was sent to the us in what was the largest exodus of children ages infant to 18 yrs of in the western hemisphere.  my mother  who was the bravest woman i ve ever known was willing to never see me again if it meant my having freedom and the freedom to worship god. i m so very glad and thankful that she is no longer here to see this devastation. i know down to my soul that every nation in the bible that killed or sacrificed to moloch their children  has been erased from the face of the earth never to be seen or heard of again.  we are about to be one of those nations.  there s no stopping it.  it has to happen.  the cleansing has to be as profound as the cleansing of the flood.  once a country loses god  there is no turning back. so  my dear friend  thank you for your honesty and your love for humanity.  i wish you godspeed and the best health ever. your friend and you are and will continue to be in my prayers.
if i could hit the like button on this after every sentence  i would.
patriot nurse  i wish more people were like you.i really do. one of my friends fails to see just what is coming and no matter what i do to help him open his eyes  he chooses blissful ignorance.our country is in serious trouble. economically  morally  culturally  and while i m not religious i d still say spiritually.what concerns me is what happens when if things really fall apart.for some reason  maybe it is optimism bias  we never seem to think it will happen to us.i m preparing as best as i can. officially lost 30 pounds and i ve never felt better
preach it sister
magic word  corrupt judges   ! that includes the supreme court judges.
amen... his mercy and forbearance is the only reason we are still afloat. thank you  father. we humbly praise your name.
please don t ever stop presenting the truth patriot nurse. i need to hear what you have to say.  respectfully yours.
amen  i needed to hear that.
i still have written references for meds.noro is rough  but fortunately short lived.thanks for your message. i see it similarly
i agree with you.  god bless.  thank you for your service.
thank you for your passion pn.thank you for sounding the alarm- we love you
thanks pn. very good video and my wife and i heard more of your southern accent in this video. we love it. when the temp of my blood rises the southern  mountain accent comes out too. bless you!
as john macarthur  our favorite gospel preaching pastor  says - this country is and has been for awhile under god s judgement. we just found your site and wanted to shout out  thanks ! stan and chris - greenville texas - retired af.
patriot nurse!   stay strong and god bless!
amen!  sister. ...we have become so comfortable as an american society  we have become  numb ..to reality and god. we have become    comfortabley numb  per se. credit to roger waters.
you are absolutely right! every thing you said. remember  we re only here for a little while. our life on earth is a test  don t fail. treat others well and do no harm. pray to the lord often. as far as firearms go l m a big 2a guy  but after considerable thought  l don t want to harm anyone ever. if harm comes to me  l pray to have the strength of my savior and face it willingly! my wife went to heaven and my prayer is to join her when my day s are over. do not want to jeopardize my chances by being violent!
well presented as always pn.  thanks for bringing these things to light and spitting truth.  god bless.
we have forgotten from where we came. our morals and values have slowly evaporated into a mist. i fear for the lives of my children  grown and littles. we will never be what we were in my generation again or that of my parents. we cannot stop the train we are on  as it picks up speed and runs away with all that was good and just. find your peace and protect yourself best you can.
it s deep and swampy but for such a time as this we were placed here. i sure do hear you about riding the cat seems very dangerous. trust in god is going to be what gets us through. it was never prosperous to go into debt. heaven is what makes it worth it.

this greatly saddens and angers me at the disdain and hatred aimed at your friends. i keep praying for god s judgement upon many  but i also realize this country has to come under judgement  whether sins of ommision or commission. i pray for the lost and that i will have a deeper relationship with the lord. i m thankful you are feeling better physically  but am praying for the hurt you re enduring. god bless

totally agree. judgements have started and will increase. we live in such a godless society. isra l is also the signs for us. pray without ceasing for that nation.
i have no words to say but words of thanks that you speak up with the truth. i am thankful that god has created such a person of character  honesty  respect and truthfulness that is not afraid to speak the truth. thank you pn for this message because this needs to be broadcast everywhere to help people open their eyes. let us stay strong in the one true god who is the true foundation.
these things must come to pass plus so much worse and in closer intervals.. don t get stressed .. trust the lord.. god is still in control.. you must pray for your government for they are still over you. that s the best you can do.. calm down now and breathe
absolutely wonderful
amen  sister!
very sorry what happened in tennessee today. nobody is safe anywhere.
sharing with my small family and my small church.
praying for your friends   patriot nurse
the whole truth spoken..god bless you dear sister in christ
your video is pure dynamite!!!
amen sister
this is just the beginning. perhaps sooner than later we shall weep no more
you have my support lord of lords.
you are a force to be reckoned with dear lady. so thankful to our god we find more like yourself who are uncompromised to our true and mighty god. it s been very obvious for a long time about where we are headed. i am honored to be an american woman who believes in god...and reflect on memories of peace and prosperity and love of our creator and nation which will hopefully be a part of our history that we will remember and cherish. the world is beginning a brand new chapter  one that will be filled with pain and regret. god help us  sister.
i don t mind taking the time to hear the whole story. but these days  oftentimes the headlines are just clickbait and if the headlines aren t clickbait they tend to spend 20 minutes talking about anything and everything but the subject at hand until the very end. suffice it to say that i m genuinely interested to hear all of what you have to say. and i am not in a rush to consume it.
very well said.
well said!!!!
this may be cliche  but the end really is near  but rejoice  for our redemption is near as well
amen sister!

great video.  thank you.

thank you patriot nurse.
well  then let s get the chastisement started.  the sooner it starts  the sooner it ends then we can have nice things again
the first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.  mark caine
woman you are awesome and i dont throw that word around your fire and wisdom and clarity are stunning gotta meet ya someday! im so happy to see ya 110 percent again this was your most compelling video ever for me i feel and think exactly like you we are beset by demons and its often hard to remain calm for me i must always remind myself our god tells us that vengeance is his i know we are in a dark place as a nation and i am fearful but i know he is with those who love him you are an amazing woman take care and god bless
first time watching and now subscribed.. i have to say  i tip my hat ..your words not only hit home but are true. to bad there are more karen s in the world and not more with open eyes like you..thank you
i have watching you since you started.  always great content.  this show however really hit the spot.  i m afraid it s too late for this world.  now even israel is fighting among themselves.  i too had a friend in israel who was killed by a terrorist.  he was stabbed multiple times. he gave chase and shot his attacker then bled out. righteous men do what they can why this country is arguing over what pronouns and bathrooms to use.
thank you for exposing the log in my eye.  some trust in horses  others in chariots.  i trust in adonai.  trust in him.  life is in him.  trust him.
amen!! god bless you!!
well dear lady certainly a huge tragedy out of israel i hope you get plenty of support from folks around you i ve been trying to maintain a positive outlook and it s become more difficult i think it s going to be some cutting loose some of the i want this i like to say it best you just can t fix stupid it s rather like take care of your physical health or your spiritual and when you get down to that little bit and it s an easy choice all the best to you and yours
praying for dave for a speedy recovery and praying for the peace of jerusalem

you have a lot of good truth to offer america. we need it! i am an injured veteran who has been told for 15 years my spinal injury is  not service related  after being an air born ranger for 7 years. you are absolutely right.  there is no way the current legislature wants to rehabilitate a warrior for god to join the ranks of patriotic americans. a god-fearing man with a rifle and combat experience is they re worst fear. we did mostly humanitarian missions but also hunted evil men that would by force control water sources  cut kids arms off and destroy families  in order to control the populus of an entire country. we also did combat support and rescue for special forces.   we saved a lot of lives  since  i ve lost my right to legally buy firearms   no criminal record  mental deficiency  or explanation   had to fight in court for parental rights  where i was told it was the law that i had to hire an attorney.   i won representing myself  america is in great parrel. thank you for your courage!god leads a ranger  rangers lead the way! god bless us all!.
your narrative is spot on. truth is the narrative.
it angers me  and i wonder how no one can step up and say enough is enough- we are taking our country back!
i enjoy both youtube and tik tok. youtube is great for discourses. tik tok is great for mostly  unfiltered information and quick  to-the-point pertinent info. rumble is amazing for unfiltered info. point  back off the tik tok  we need every avenue  allowed  in our current state. we need every person regardless  of attention span. sorry  to hear about your friend. god bless you and thanks for your courage and love for our country. praise god  lord almighty!
preach it sister!  joel 2
i don t think anything will save this country. i believe it s too late and this is too big to be stopped.

end of days.....sodom and gomorrah and days of noah. jesus is at the door. be ready
over the last few months have removed two local dirty judges in a sw wi. county  and combing through the deppities as well  with some numbers.and have my ice-cream pail nearly full of badges that will be used to make river sinkers.  its a hobby of mine.  somebody has to win these battles.cowboy up. if you ain t fightin the enemy  you are the enemy. if you don t know who the enemy is  you certainly won t survive. big dummy is a fitting epitaph.
@rare bond  so many brave people....on social media.
can t disagree with your assessments. gonna always choose the red pill. but wondering what the standing is of our accountability as a nation  when at least the recent abominations of our federal government have been done by power and not by authority. and how does it play out with us being a covenant nation that hasn t yet fulfilled our purpose. god bless  and steady on.
in my state  if you didn t get the clot shot you are denied adequate blood  care. hub needed 3 pints  only got one. claimed shortage. primary care checked..no shortage. he still has collapsed veins. iv at the hospital left him with a blood clot in his upper right arm. can t treat that tho  because the dr who was supposed to test him regarding internal bleeding couldnt seem to do it  and the floating office mgr floats among two big groups of drs and has locked us out of seeing anyone in our area. so 8 weeks out  we are having to go to the next county over  possibly further to get the problem addressed. figured out the clot shot connection via politicians in our state. i would have never believed this could happen before now.
years ago i thought i was among christians that believed god.they sure did a great deal of talking the walk. they had all the verbiage down pat. then  after i had helped them for many years the time came when i needed their help with money. their help doing god s will.their response was confusing at the time but hindsight gives greater clarity. they  after preaching for many years  give and it shall be give  declared emphatically   there s no free money .there are very telling statements that fake christians make  many false doctrines they believe that they won t reveal until life has you in a job trial.  there s no free money . you re not supposed to be trying to make money. you re supposed to just do it for jesus . you re just trying to keep from going out and getting work .then  after many years of struggling  going weeks when your entire daily rations amount to a couple of sweet rolls and a can of vienna sausages  you finally find a job only to lose it three months later because your body is no longer strong enough to do all the heavy lifting the job requires. once they see that you clearly cannot hold onto a job  they will sentence you to death saying   if a man does not work  neither shall he eat .as much as those that claimed to be christian boasted of their superior spiritual position over and above an unemployed homeless man  their response to an unemployed homeless man during the great recession is very telling.when months later and suffering from an illness i was not recovering from  i was certain that i was dieing and i asked the lord   why wouldn t they help me do your will  the lord s response was quite revealing as the holy spirit brought to my remembrance that which jesus taught us   if you love me  keep my commandments .i have heard pastors and evangelists for years cry out   america needs revival . yet  not a single one of them would lift a finger to help me do what i had helped many of them do over the years  god s will.maybe things will change after i publish my book.but then  if the book sells  they will no doubt condemn me for being rich while others  will claim to be my best friends.time will tell.time will tell.when christians get off their ego trips and repent from these attitudes  then god will hear from heaven  forgive their sin and heal our land.
i believe yah took his hand off this country quite awhile ago .  there was a time when moral hard ass men who had a fear of their creator would ruck up and rush head long into the nest of evil and eradicate it.
your most important video to date...my opinion
how delightful to hear the truth..... great show!!@ keep up the great work!!!
so very sorry for the loss of your friend.
i have aaallll my nursing books at hand never pitched have always preferred books over net. good video thank you.
amen sister!
as a south african this resonates. we  also  voted ourselves into sosialism in 1994 believing the leftist media and nwo lies. now nearly 30 years of hard-core leftism have basically destroyed our once beautiful country. its terrible having to endure the injustice  racism and intollerence of dei. its painful to witness the destruction and corruption of all you hold dear and holy. however the antidote to despair is faith  community and self-help action. if we  as a small minority in a sea of chaos and evil can survive and even thrive  so too can the american pioneer spirit.
our government has no understanding  or if they do  god help them. i recognize that we may not be strong  but we must be. it s our hope. prayer and do good things. sorry about your friend. i m prepping. take care
thank you sister !!! god bless your faithfulness
the consolidation of the states into one vast republic  sure to be aggressive abroad and despotic at home  will be the certain precursor of that ruin which has overwhelmed all those that have preceded it.  - robert e. lee
amen god bless you
love you  thank you!
you  my precious sister  are 100  correct. may our lord bless you and forgive us for our country s gross sin. i am so thankful that we have a savior.
thank you from canada. not going so good over hear as well  as you may well know. god bless.
you gave me chills. awsome and thank u. i hope your pain will pass quickly.
if anyone hasn t read the harbinger books by jonathan cahn  you may want to check them out. they are definitely relevant to this discussion. there is also a harbinger documentary that just came out recently.
the spiritual urgency is shared
thank you so much patriot nurse   so grateful to the lord that you are feeling a lot better. god bless   keep you in his tender care.
thank you!
you are speaking truth i believe we are living in the last days father god as taking his protection off this country and most people don t have a clue what is going on
you are sooooo right.
spitting the truth bombs today love it sister!
thank you patriot nurse! we are under judgment as a nation! 1963 prayer and bible was taken out of the schools. 67million abortions plus since 1974. top on pedifila   top in same sex marriage. we have turned our back on god... repentance and turn to god!! we are past the point of no return. pray and prepare!!  god bless!! look to jesus christ. susan hatch
they have kicked the can down the road hoping the younger generation would  miraculously  fix the problems by being from the future and supposedly smarter. problem is we can only get out of this by going back to gold and bartering.
you are absolutely right!
i stumbled on this video    i m glad i did!  i agree totally w what you ve shared  especially with the judgement part. as you said  there s many reasons for gods  judgement  but i d like to share concerning one major sin  abortion. i ve said for years    continue saying it  if the blood of righteous abel cried out from the ground to the lord  multiply that by the millions of the babies murdered by abortion. god judged cain immediately  can we expect him to ignore the blood of those innocents !  as paul would say it  god forbid! i truly have believed keep believing that that factor alone is one of the reasons we re under his judgement. obviously  there s many more    i fear for my grandchildren s future. i m 65   disabled now  and almost every day  sometimes more than once  i m praying  come quickly  lord jesus! . it s wonderful seeing listening to such a fine patriot woman   keep praying   fighting  my sister!
we are in trouble bless your friend and wife i would like to be one to try and stand in the gap of where we go from here pregnant and a little afraid but i wanna show my girls you are to be grafted as his people we stand ready to fight whatever hell is in store bless them especially a true american marine who is god s son.
hey  good to see you! i hope you are feeling better!!!
air force nuclear codes custodial officer   mr. president  may i see your nuclear biscuit  please  fjb   that sounds like a pretty good biscuit. i love biscuits. in fact  i invented biscuits back when corn pop was chasing me around the swimming pool. by the way  have you seen my wife  doc   i think i need a bump.
it is ridiculous how high and unfair the standards are for nurses. if the everyday person did the same things at their job but at a nurse s position  there is a chance they would be fired that day.
yes ma am. speak! thank you
don t take drugs! there is other ways to heal the body! allowing the body to do what it knows is best! herbs and native knowledge and essiac cassie tea!! love you.
i agree with you 100  amein halleluyah praises yah through yeshua.  jesus in english . shalom dear patriot  nurse.
first i want to say nice to see you feeling better! second you are spot on this.thank you for informative information take care god bless
great sorrow for our fallen nation. for our children! immeasurable sacrifice if so many before us! sacrifice known  only to the almighty. come lord jesus !
ok  it s a little thing  but i have that exact cup - and it s awesome!  ice lasts a solid 12 hrs  i love it.
can t beat a up tone person
shalom sister! thank you! we have a grandson was in the marines  dad   father-in-law. brother in law army and navy!    they cannot believe this government! grandson got out after 7 yr.   said it was changing and he couldn t do it anymore   becoming a joke!   he is in medical field..pa..    thank you for all you do ! bless you!
they might even be fired after the first hour.
you got that right.
brothers   sisters the sword of justice hangs dangerously over our nation and is shortly about to fall
i was surprised   sad to hear about david stern   his wife...i pray god will heal him   his wife....my search for the truth led me to his  complete jewish bible . after some years later i became a believer in jesus....i enjoy your videos.... keep it going!
it is all warped  unfortunately we do reap what we sow.
spot on 100   i joined the military in 95 served until 2008  with that being said  why did i bring this up   i was going career until 08  how fast things went from hooorah to  excuse the expression  oh shit what the hell is going on  when obama got into office  i saw along with others a nightmare play out and here we are now  i love my country not a fan of  our government anymore trump yadda yadda whatever  joebama got into office everything obama started is now full force in play all of what obama didn t succeed at doing is now what we are seeing folks our government is nothing more then lip service and we allowed it  everything going on now we allowed it  now in true honesty we can fight until the last person is standing but the damage that has been done with this idiot in office will take years to repair if we are still here to fix it and that still might not be long enough.
glory to god!
enjoyed your video.
well said
looking back  this could ve been a warning for what happened in tennessee today.
s to you   your fruends
you are so right!
i think you are anointed nurse  you see things and you are wise. wish i could articulate it like you do. this was a very good video. thank you and god bless you.
sister    my precious lady of knowing! when the madness of crowds begins the civil suits won t save then! you know that   it s game over! let s help it and then get on with ruling our own lives! we do and we win    they get awards for their performance and we get the glory of the crown  given back to us as judges! love be you lady! you get the crown! get our soldiers home
i am grateful to hear that david and rachel are alive. as a friend of israel  i believe the culpability extends beyond just us defense dollars to all those  esp. celebs  supporting the bds initiative. the hatred against god s people is woven deeply into western culture  now. the abominations we inflict upon the innocent cry out for judgment. i believe the lawless one is come. he walks the earth  now.
a true clarion call. amen!
when the foundations are being destroyed what can the righteous do    the answer to this question is actually the first verse of the psalm.   in the lord i take refuge.  how then can you say to me flee like a bird to your mountain.   i love psalm 11.  our refuge is yahweh and yes the foundations are being destroyed.  our spiritual prep is to learn to abide in christ and take refuge in him.
hi  thank you for all you do.very much appreciated.            k from az.
you re awesome  so incredibly awesome
speak truth sisteris coming
i m the healer in my home and the only one worried about preparedness food water medicine etc and it s so stressful..i m glad to see you feeling better
absolutely.
@thepatriotnurse  check out windswept house by malachi martin.
i too  am thankful your friends are ok. i was getting worried there! i pray for fast healing! they are very brave! i so admire people who can think clearly and act in a very scary and chaotic moment. i ve never had that ability.
there are many right now. we are not to live in fear. stand for the truth and love one another as ourselves.  god s children are everywhere   some don t know who they are!
i am also grateful. thank you!
let s talk now i have something bigger to introduce  .......
me too. my husband has no idea what s coming. i m just trying to prepare as best i can food  water  learning new skills  god bless you and our nation
@rachel adam  hang in there i am doing the same..i can food  i ve learned how to make tinctures and salves and oils .put away can food..they all think i m crazy of course but that s ok..someone has to do it and they all will think me one day but til then i m gonna keep on doing what i can
personally  i only prepare for storms. there is no preparing really for what these bastards are drumming up. but  i can tell you this - we will be ruthless to these soulless evil doers.
wow  your passion and knowledge is awakening. you speak from your heart and have stole mine. god bess youi and us all.      ftd
amen. well said.
thank you  dear sister ......!   godspeed.
those of us with god.. we will survive. those others.. perish! god bless us all much as possible!
right on  my friend!
as much as i hate to say it  your analysis is one i must agree with. god is patient and generous   but will not be forever mocked.  if god did not hesitate to bring tribulations upon his people when they departed from the way of life he insists upon  why should we think it cannot happen to us  please take care of yourself  so that the message you bringing may continue.
right on target!
amazing! thank you !
in the last days they will call good bad and bad good
william cooper s behold a pale horse tells you all you need to know about what s going on
i wish to god i could give more then one thumbs up on this post.  will be shareing to discord.
excellent segment. you are on it patriot nurse.
got preps  skills-emt experience gained in south central  comms skills  dispatch  build things  fix anything  shoot straight  and keep my head screwed on tight in emergent situations. still  none of it will mean a damn when the supplies run dry. you can completely empty a trauma box in one traffic accident  and  there s food  only until it runs out. and nothing will grow under the crap the government sprays on us from altitude  every day. no one looks up anymore. they can t comprehend what s in  plane  sight. communications gear is nearly useless once the repeaters go down. and ammo can be stolen  taken or simply used up.the holy bible says we will soon be throwing our gold and silver in the street as it will be of no value.i can bleed out a foe in an emergency  but who would have thought that spiritual warfare  reliance on the power of jesus christ against unseen foes  would be even more important feed the souls with scripture and truth. love one another and have mercy on those who are against you. seek to know god and his works.live for the spirit and recognize that the ultimate fight is against satan and his filthy demons who strive to separate us from salvation. give me the weapons of faith  love  salvation  truth  peace  and jesus  and no man or unclean spirit can kill my soul.i m too old to care about this world  it s a lost cause and soon to be destroyed along with legions of the fallen and corrupt.but  there is a rescue happening soon. in the clouds. seek the salvation of christ s blood shed for us and pray for god s grace. one day soon  you ll be able to reach out for the son of god when he comes for his children  living and dead. know the biblical word of god through the prophets  the new testament and the book of revelation. it s as fresh as tomorrow s news.until that day  mourn for the lost and what they are about to endure. and take comfort knowing that jesus knows your name and god knew you before he formed you in your mother s womb. everything else is just waiting to crumble before new jerusalem  and a new earth fit for a king and his children  rises from the ashes of war.
i m a baby  boomer and i approve of this message 100 .
amen sister
at your local va  a good chunk of employees show up drunk
thank you for the truth we all know the stupid shit in the world and are great country fall apart. i have your back as i do for the millions that know but will not move till the sht hits the fan  but they are ready thank god.
thank you for all you do.
amen! my sister in christ  jesus said in the last days it would wax worse and worse   jesus is coming for us  and wrath is coming for the ungodly  tribulation is coming! fear not our redeemer draweth nigh! jesus is king of kings and lord of lord! praise our mighty lord!
this is why we need to keep our focus on the lord jesus
thanks for watching for further discussions on wealth planning.
keep praying is all that i can say.  but stay prepared.
if you re god first then family then country you can see this is spiritual warfare.  we need to put on our armor of god and stand firm in our faith
all the honour to you
which is why we have faith in the lord  why we prepare
i have had little or no money my entire life.poverty doesn t mean the same thing to me  it is just not having money. at some point  people are going to be forced to live the same lifestyle  the difference being that i have a lifetime of experience and they have avoided it their entire lives.
fire me up   pn.  i cannot believe that was your friends that went thru that.   and how they were treated during and after!   hearing that story makes us want to go defend israel and the patriots that are there.   if we don t stand with israel  who will    god alone    heaven forbid...lord. rise up   and may all the enemies of the lord god beware when he rises from his throne!....... many prayers and blessings....
good called evil  evil called good is here in a giant way.
i ve been telling people for forty years that this unprecedented prosperity cannot last.  historically it never has.  we had better be prepared as a nation for what comes next. well... here we are...
yep.   that s why my crypto bags  ammo  silver are raising in price.
beautiful mind  beautiful heart  beautiful person.
ditto pn  wethepeople won t react without a known felt start.
i love you and your passion.... can t wait to live with you forever..... soon
amen! and amen!
absolutley!!! rah rah rah!!! you make my day.
took emt  and back country emergency years ago. old lady can do a lot.
what a time to be alive!
amen   again i say amen!
pistols purpose  to get back to your rifle  which should have been within arms reach. amen patriot nurse!!!
hello patriot nurse is the destined for war book you mentioned authored by graham allison  thanks
i fear we as a once great nation have failed to the point we cannot continue without massive suffering. i do pray we will all uinite and march against this current government before it s a total loss  but there are so many people now that are completely clueless  and are doing nothing to help.
for further discussions on wealth planning.
god bless you little sister.  we love you. thank you for being you.
when the wicked rule the people mourn.  unlike nearly all nations in history.  the people of the united states freely choose their leaders.  as a nation we are left without excuse.  on the whole  americans have turned away from god and are left without a moral compass.  satan rages in their hearts and laughs at their impending misery.  god and his son protect those who love  obey and serve them  whether in life or the life to come.god bless you for being a voice of warning and your righteous works.
strong southern woman i love it
excellent video!
also being a trapper and forager  i don t have to depend on gmo foods sold at the grocery stores. all free ranging organic food. that the hides can be made into stylish clothing.
amen! my sister in christ
much much appreciated pn. struck me right in my heart and soul and motivates me to keep going!
collect physical books  especially dictionaries and reference books  in this era when words are being redefined and classics are being rewritten online.
it is as if history isn t taught.  there is a road map for all of this.

i am 70. for years my instincts has been making me prepare. i have seen the decay of humanity in general and it has festered into this painful human boil that is ready to burst  get infected with more nasty business  on those of us who want to live righteous peaceful lives.am i ready  naw. no matter what flashlight i buy it breaks  they do not last  stops charging.  tazers no longer charge or work. dehydrated food tastes like bad carb glue.i suppose it will be better then nothing. bug sprays dry up. or stop spraying. and mold grows on everything. i got cast iron pots  pans  i know how to gut and skin a road kill. i have some weed identification skills where all the vitamins live.after 30 years of fight or flight mentality  preparing for  pretty much everything and anything.  i feel to old to go through what i feel is coming. i want to feel safe  be warm and not have to endure to much hunger.  i am not mentally equipped to throw earth worms in my stew pot along with dandelion greens and stinging nettles and call it supper.my body doesn t want to be wet and cold. my hips don t want to sleep on hard ground  and ticks live in leaves.i have watched  shocked beyond belief as i see massive floods  fires  and tornadoes or hurricanes and now chemical explosions take out entire towns. people s livestock  gone  weapons  houses  pets   food and  medical preps  clothes gone  in seconds!  a tornado  or floods can scatter them all over town in seconds  fires turn them to ash along with your big burkey water filter  dehydrated food buckets  bullets and first aid kits. gone in seconds. i silently sit in gratitude that i am not one of those shocked dazed people wandering like lost pets trying to figure out what happened  where their lives are strewn and how they will find food  water shelter. i close my eyes and pray for them and in gratitude i m not in that position. i m not sure what i would do. how does one prepare for all of that  you can t. keep as much emergency stuff in your car  and pray it doesn t get broke into  or fly away in a tornado  or float away during a flood. or have to be abandoned in a road block  massive accident. at my age  i know i can t lug a back pack. i switched to a duffle with wheels. can t run with it  but i could drag it for a while. what do you do when all you have left is the clothes on your back as you run like hell from unholy fires  all you might have for money is the change in your cars junk boot from morning coffees. it s pouring and do u have a waterproof tarp or garbage bags to stay dry the only place anything is safe anymore is under ground  but unless you can put it  inside totally water tight containers  rust proof  then bugs  rats  mice  chipmunks all will enjoy your food. plastic toats are useless  any rodent can chew holes through them.  and will you after a tornado or floods even remember where you buried it all i have stored my weapons in the house  in proper bags  they rusted. behind the door  under bed all covered in rust.  nothing is safe.  my point is. unless one has all the info stored inside their head  along with well guarded paper books for reference  where the only survival tools is a pocket knife  clothes on your back and many many views of survivor shows so you remember what to do when mosquitoes  blk flys attack. what plant to rub on bee stings. which moss is antiseptic when you trip and fall and skin your knees. what snakes and spiders are poison....mostly  get your soul prepared. get your spirit in line with god. prepare to die for your beliefs  and do not stand down. we were not ment to stay here anyway. this here on earth  is where we expand and learn whatever cosmic stuff we are supposed to be learning. then we go back to god. learn how to create a make shift water filter  and how to create charcoal. it makes a filter as well as when you get sick it removes toxins  detoxes what is making you sick. if it is bad food especially.  i am sorry for the loss  murder of your friends.  this world  our earth   i m afraid probably is labeled a red x danger don t visit world. i personally do not think those in power are human. if they were  they have been body jacked by demons. they got human skin on but they are not human.just watch congress  the senate  in any country  and observe. hardly a human amongst them. all something else. not human anymore. they don t want peace  nor healthy  especially not happy humans. they thrive on negative vibrational frequencies. on war  suffering  sickness  anger  it feeds them. and they have been here since the beginning. this is not the first rodeo.prayer is the  light  it is a positive frequency more powerful then any weapon they have out there. we have something they hate it is called free will.  which is why they have taken prayer away from children in schools. they are destroying our children right before our eyes. these damaged children will grow up with a empty hole in their souls  and the evil demons will fill that hole with lies  false truths  until these children have no moral ground left on which to stand. murder will be normal  rape ok  drugs  thief as justified need. they don t know how nor want to work.hurt babies and young children  or the old will be ok  they will have 0 moral compass. the parents of these children will be their child s first target. it tells us this in the bible. children will turn in their own parents for fun. probably won t miss them when they are hauled away. this evil will feed off their souls as they drift into drugs and despair trying to fill that god void.we can see it happening already. they  evil ones  don t want people to pray  it hurts them. they go crazy when a prayer is said around them. they don t want light or love because they were cave dwellers. so they chem trail our sky s to always be twilight. and to kill our food.this is a spiritual war  and we need to lock and load our souls and our  prayers. you must try the best you can to keep anger  despair   and negative feelings at bay  try to ignore what you can t do anything about  except pray over and about it.  constantly try to express and feel love and light  towards everyone even when you don t want to.  chant it like a mantra.love light  love light. you never know who your prayers might change for the good. be as kind as you can be. but don t let anyone step on you  use you  or betray you. be on guard at all times. trust few  pray for many. it s how i get through bad days. remember  the bad politicians all over the world  the actors  musicians  all sold their souls to the devil  for fame  power  wealth  and a flash in the pan. for most it is a fast flash. they are not allowed to live long  before they also are sacrificed to whoever is the demon da jure.but life is short  and there is another life after this one. they are not going to be happy when they die. for them there will be no turning back. no oops  i made a mistake. use your free will for bad   there are consequences. pray daily that the lord can find enough righteous people to save us.it almost worked for lot. he negotiated with god many times. except he couldn t find even one righteous person during his day. we all know how that worked out for sodom and gomorrah. at my age i have decided all i can do is watch the show. it s a horror show  with to much shock and awe.  there is not much i can do. so i pray a lot..i can t run  can t lug a back pack or heavy stuff  can t walk or hike for more then a mile at best.i have decided that in a survival situation  i would be expendable if i couldn t be of some use. so fill your heads with knowledge. buy paper books and protect them at all costs.  useful knowledge. for that moment when all you have is nail clippers  pocket change  and pocket of lint  or whatever u got on you when u had to run. at some point in the future  i think we will all have to run. we will all be on the move to avoid created bad weather  water and mud floods  fires  man made viruses and bacteria  demons  i can only hope the love and light people can find each other and form a group. power in numbers for prayer. power in numbers for survival.mostly i pray there is a rapture. cause i don t want to hang around to see how this movie ends.
i m nobody but the lord god is on my side and because i know he loves me i know he loves you .
yes you are so so right my friend
very grateful for the powerful testimony from patriot nurse.  thank you!as a christian and member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints  this message rings true.  whether or not you believe in the book of mormon  true is truth.  i believe in the holy bible and the book of mormon.  in those scripture it talks about the pride cycle. repentant god fearing people became prideful and idolatrous.  after a time they are either enslaved or destroyed by war and then are humbled back to god.   over and over this cycle continues.  i know we are in the last days before christ comes again.  we need to follow the commandments and act as gods people should.  the only truth and only sure way out is through christs example.  i love him.  miracles do not cease.  thank goodness for the god fearing humble people in the world  wherever you are.  i love you and pray that those that are wicked will come back to him.  there is a reason that christs coming is called the great and dreadful day of the lord.
yes america exports their inflation to the rest of the world. this stuff moves in generational cycles.

i was born in 1942 so my whole life has been spent under this from the beginning of it. i have had to really examine the way i think and do a lot of looking into history. even history has been rewritten though. god is the only one we have for sure.
good to see you again!
i appreciate your care for what is going on in america and israel and the world in generally. may g-d give you strength to continue on. what i am writing below is a matter of truth without any anger or hate to anyone. i believe to let everyone believe as they like. i grew up in new york and had many non-jewish friends.the evil of today is the extension or continuation of the roman empire and it is unfortunate that the new religion that replaced them had many facets which include the evil ways of the roman empire.in the end  only one way of serving g-d will be revealed to be g-d s true will.columbus was a jew and did not make an error when looking for a shorter root to india and ended up in america. the fact that he is jewish is supported by his personal writings which he wrote in a language called ladino that was invented by jews just like yiddish which was used by european jews.he sought a place of refuge for the jews of spain during the spanish inquisition but it was too late. america has served its purpose of saving the jewish people. it is time for the few remnants of the jews in exile to return to their homeland  willfully or by force . so america has served its purpose and so it will whither like an unwatered plant.     in the end  the prophets said that all of the nation s will come to make a war against israel. those who choose correctly before the final war will be saved.since you have a good heart  i recommend that you listen to rabbi tovia singer who appears on youtube on a program called tanaktalk. he answers questions online from both jews and non-jews and really has great care for non-jews. he knows everything about the tora and prophets by chapter and verse number in both hebrew and english and the same for the new testament and all of the meetings of 2000 years of the church fathers and what was discussed at these gatherings. he likewise is knowledgeable in the same way about the koran.                     it says in the tora that esav  the twin brother of jacob  is the father of edom  rome .when rome disappeared  the church took its place. when the final judgement comes  it says that g-d will judge esav and take him down from his high place.esav is most of the countries of the world that have been waging wars for thousands of years  with a special eye on the jewish people.the end and final judgement will come long before the evil plans of those in control become to be carried out.i would worry more of g-d s judgement then the evil plans of mortals.the jewish people have lived in true morality and have never gone to conquer others even when they could.time to seek to live the correct way according to g-d.
the great tribulation is about to begin..  everyone better get ready for a rough time... jesus is lord !!
prayers for your pain! god direct us! hear our prayersextending his love to you!
it will never be enough  darkness will continue to creep in with its kill steal and destroy mandate. this happens until jesus comes back and sets up his kingdom on this earth where he will rule and reign with a rod of iron and destroy all of his enemies. stay in the word  prayed up  and walk with jesus. speak his words  share the gospel  and every mindful to help those in need. it is your responsibility to be ready always to meet your maker as we do not know if tomorrow we will be in this earth suit.
dimitru dudaman said america would be destroyed by cccp as a judgement for how badly we treated each other.
welcome to the truth my sister
and the good book says   none are innocent  no not one!  every knee shall bow and tong confess  jesus is lord. so people  ask for forgiveness and repent. for he shall come like a thief in the night and claim his bride. amen sister.
we were sold out a long time ago. i am very sorry and totally disgusted with what happened to your friend.
when are americans going to realize their government has declared war on them
i don t even have words
oh my g! how awful! sorry about your friend who tried so hard. us is no longer a blessed country due to our sadam and gamorah style lives. we re toast! jesus come soon

david stern of the senior david stern  author of the complete jewish bible version ! !! regardless i will pray for your friend  wife  and family. thank you for speaking up  providing encouragement  and strength  to all of us striving to be a faithful servant.
you are right. the hand of god is against us. we have gone too far.
i m sorry for your loss patriot nurse. and with that being said  you really must acknowledge and accept that we re in a new covenant  jesus  god  told us so. please realize that we re now under a new covenant. and that we re saved by grace though faith.
i am so sorry to hear about your friend  but thank god he is alive!  i agree with your sense of impending judgement.  i m in a bible study called bible study fellowship  and the study is called the divided kingdom this year.  it s about the decline of israel before the judgement of exile into babylon.  god always arranges these studies to be so timely and applicable to our lives  individually and nationally.  just like israel  we have turned away from god and refuse to turn back!  please read the book of micah.  we read it last week  and it s like reading god s newspaper about the usa today!the good news is one day jesus will return and bring his people together again.  in the meantime  keep spreading the word for people to prepare physically  yes  but most importantly spiritually!thank you for your work for the kingdom
i m very sorry about your friend.put on your armor  your helmet  grab your sword and shield. the time is nearing.  x  deo vindice  god is our vindicator
your soooooo right!
patriot nurse  i love you as a brother.  with that said  i have been looking at travesties on both sides of the line in the area you speak about. is there a way for  their violence against each other  to stop and have any responsible semblance of trust  if not  this will never change. jesus  the warrior he was  the only begotten  son of god  would say  are there any who are without sin  if so they may throw the stones of war.     as far as the prep  teach others    amen
the ones that are awake have. the  woke  bunch agrees with the govenment.
you and i would be good friends. retired rn after a 38-year career.
the righteous can trust god.he sees and knows all things. i hope your friends are okay.god help us!! i pray god remove this demonic man and regime in dc.
make imprecitory psalms great again!
the united states as an entity  singular  was birthed at the civil war  patriot nurse. before that there was a confederation called united states  plural  of america. that ceased to exist in 1864. so  to think of that entity as dead today and regions to be alive is to bring hope back  because you re speaking of a condition that has not been known or acknowledged for 150 years.
age 66 here. my response to you is   yes. spot on. sadly.   riding the tiger with no good way off.
yes  we can take the lord jesus christ as your savior and pray to turn this nation around
preach it sister. i m pissed. i m a marine mom. and you are right. bless israel or bye bye america.
say it louder so that people in the back can hear you.
lord god heavenly father   prepare us emotionally mentally physically and spiritually for the days that lie ahead. may we be found busily about your business and ready to be a blessing to others until that day when you call us home. in the name of jesus our soon and coming king. amen.
america has walked away from god and now we will pay . the government works against the people that pay there salaries. peace and love
amen!
the deepest cut and the saddest part  is americans have allowed totalitarianism to develop and growth  have allowed the immorality to develop and grow.  america was hanging by a thread by its support for israel and now that is gone.my heart goes out to you  i share you heartbreak.  this might be the saddest of all your videos.  god bless you.
thumbed up   shared
amen to the word you quoted!
at 68 yrs old  i plainly see just how far our country has sank into the gutter. 2016-2020 were the best 4 yrs i can remember. since jan 2021  i ve seen the absolute worse yrs i can remember. and it a  progressive  process of continuously getting worse.and the worse part of that   is  it s all being done intentionally.
i truly love your videos because you are always 100 percent correct..i also love the fact that you pray to god and jesus...most jews don t accept him as  the true messiah...i ve also found through dna tests that i too have jewish ancestry through my great grandmother in lithuania and all our relatives were killed in the holocaust..i was raised a catholic but i m now converting to messianic judaism...and i ve always admired the jewish people and the idf...your video hits on the evil this nation has become..we re way beyond a revolution to change things and most men if we can call them that are weak spineless sheep to allow this evil to continue in this nation...what are we going to wait for the man bun wearing skinny jeans hipsters to save us  our only hope is to put our faith and trust in yahweh...i pray all day long and i ll add david to my prayers..he s a hero..i too am named david...shalom lady i think your a fine example of a strong jewish woman...
you get the government you deserve  i say it all the time...no one gets it when i say it...sad
the lawyers  contracts and agreements done during ww2 practically guaranteed the prosperity of america by restraining the prosperity of others.
god bless you
i have never seen you so on fire  and for good cause.  well said  hard times are coming very soon  be ready.
one of god s greatest characteristics is his mercy. scripture tells of times when individuals would plead to god  asking that he spare all for the sake of the few  good  people. we must not give up on hope and trusting in his mercy  and continue to pray for the conversion of all of our brothers and sisters. the real battle is with the demons who have taken the souls of many into captivity. pray for their release  and trust in his mercy.
i realize you patriot nurse  have to make a living but..the answer seems clear..to meet like-minded people not just behind a paywall but in person for his glory and actually being the light.city parks  bringing our own camping chairs bottles of water bibles and manuals.being an acts church..basic medicinal herb gardening meat preservation and barter. unraveling of truth  biblical  actually speaking of current events and what s to come. i m in sevierville tn. if anyone s interested in gathering lmk...
god bless you!
this is of the lord! behold he comes as a thief  get your lamps ready   garments white! let them that are unjust be unjust still   the righteous be righteous still. let them hear what the spirit says unto the churches. amen
i heard recently that there were some jews in israel who wanted to make the spreading of christianity talking about christianity etcetera etcetera illegal in israel. how do you feel about that  what would be your take on that
god bless you  keep sounding the alarm
i ll venture that biden had no idea where the nuclear football is.but i ll bet obama does.
i ve been praying for the destruction of the false gods of our society and a spirit of repentance to come because of their fall.
amen!!!!!!!
we ve spit in god s face.  yes  we are coming under severe judgment.  one does not mock god and live. i pray that god will remember his remnant here in this country.
measure for measure.  a shakespeare  comedy  as well.
very prophetic
as the whirlwind passeth  so is the wicked no more  but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. as vinegar to the teeth  and as smoke to the eyes  so is the sluggard to them that sent him. the reverence of the lord prolongeth days  but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. the hope of the righteous shall be gladness  but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.proverbs 10  25-28therefore whosoever heareth these saying of mine  and doeth them  i will liken him unto a wise man  which built his house upon a rock  and the rain descended  and the floods came  and the winds blew  and beat upon that house  and it fell not  for it was founded upon a rock.matthew 7  24   25christ is our rock much love pn.
is there any way you could contact black conservative patriot on you tube or redacted.  to let them know so maybe they could get the word out to more people. more people should really know so maybe they could get their head out of the sand.
we deserve judgement.
i love you using your voice to stand up for  and with the people of israel... i have many friends in israel - people as close as family - itamar  elon moreh and har bracha included. and as a grandma pushing on 70 candles  i m praying for you and the unique way in which our abba king wove your dna into his own. sending a healing hug.
i m can see the pain in your eyes and your voice.  i ve been awake for some time now.  i ve been seeing our country turned into a evil in this world i never wanted to believe that our country would turn its back on god and his people.  and we are babylon of the past .
always appreciate your comments
ok class. put your collective heads together and tell me how she s wrong   take all the time you need!!
stop paying taxes!  stop giving these criminals the fruits of your labor.
you couldn t  be more right!!!
i love this lady! we need more ppl like you. a true woman. keep on talking we are listening.
can t lean on a shovel and pray for a hole... much love good folks.
if we re picking teams  i pick patriot nurse !
we could have been a force for good  but avarice overtook us and we squandered the goodwill we had built up.  instead of doing the right thing at all times we instead did whatever was necessary to shore up our position in the world by whatever means were necessary.  military means  financial means  covert operations  ignoring treaties  murder  regime change.  what comes around goes around.
if the united states of america does not stand with israel  we are done!  thank you pn for your heartfelt video!! praying for a change of heart from our government. there are too many of us that only want good and righteous things for our country.  god bless the usa
it s ok the have things as long as things don t have you.
the hot war vs.  russia china is closer than we think. every morning i pray for young people  victims like the residents of east palestine  and finally for our once great country.
i m starting to believe that america is the babylon mentioned in revelations
hoping you re feeling better.
god is in control.
oh lord! we done invoked a curse upon our nation!!!  on a tiger!!  i think we should pay corporate ceos and politicians more millions of dollars because they will always look out for us.  i am thankful that our president trump has taken care of those j6 s tourist s legal bills like he promised. promises made  promises kept.
it stinks that we  the people  will face judgement for stupid decisions by our leaders.
this country  and this world  deserves what s coming.  to anyone reading this  if you re not born again and saved by the blood of jesus. change that today! the rapture is imminent!
target practice tomorrow with two sessions   morning and evening...you coming to both  excellent good girl.
thanks!
the bretton woods agreement made the us dollar  usd  the  reserve currency .  if brazil wants to buy cattle from argentina they pay for them in usd. then we used the big stick to force the oil producers to only accept usd in payment for oil creating the  petrodollar . iran and saudi arabia have just formally applied to join brics. this means that countries don t need the usd anymore to buy oil. our largest export is dollars  not food  not electronics  not movies  dollars.  when the rest of the world don t want dollars how do we buy anything since we don t make anything the world wants   so how big now are the brics   adding all the countries in brics  applied to brics and have asked to apply to brics  like mexico  the majority of the world s gdp is now with brics not the petrodollar. we lost. what will we do  the  answer  for the establishment is war. we have to overthrow the government of saudi arabia and install someone hostile to iran to again destabilize the middle east. meanwhile we re overthrowing the government of georgia to be ukraine 2.0 and another front against russia to try to destabilize the belt   road initiative. finally  the 150 countries participating in the belt and road have said they don t care about any of this green build back better davos wef nonsense.  only the us  canada and western europe are continuing to cut our own throats over this carbon nonsense while the world laughs at us.
this is why i would not be against an american divorce. i don t want to live in the same country as those crazy and evil people.
beautiful
bravo!!
i ve gotten word that israel may soon fall  if it did not already.  msm crickets.  praying for david and his wife.
oooooweeee!! i ve been waiting for one of your videos!! just started ..
she is ideal. much respect p.n.
i will stand on the bible until my last breath
satan is ruling this world and as his time gets shorter  he s double tripled down to take as many as he can away from god to the lake of fire. don t give him that control over you!!!
i m sitting
there is a documentary titled  will you go to hell for me  by vince everett ellison. an excellent challenge to any  christian  voting democrat. there is a larry elder episode where he interviews vince ellison. the ellison dvd  highly recommended as a wake up call to slumbering  christians  still set on voting for the democrats.
god bless you!!
the only thing we can do is rip the rot out of the ground and start over.
nah  we can no longer say that we re god fearing people  and god will work it all out. christians and conservatives as a whole are complicit  because they ve become complacent for this reason! because  god will work it out . we re going to be judged. christians and conservatives like to sit on the sidelines  complaining  but then do absolutely nothing about it. yes  you ll be judged for that. so glad our founding fathers put some actions behind their words. where would we be if they hadn t samuel adams said it perfectly  if ye love wealth better thanliberty  the tranquility ofservitude better than theanimating contest of freedom go home from us in peace. weask not your counsels or arms.crouch down and lick the handswhich feed you. may yourchains set lightly upon you  andmay posterity forget that yewere our countrymen.
if it s illegal to share the gospel of christ in israel  is it really israel we re talking about i think not.
only designed evil can be this successful.
praying for your friend and his family. i have great respect for you  your principles  and what you do so i ask this with humility. and i obviously don t expect a reply. but how do you reconcile the jewish people as a group  as a nation  as a whole  rejection of our savior  if our nations success and prosperity depends on following jesus and the standards set out in the bible  what of a nation who reject jesus as the messiah  god made a covenant with isreal true  but was not jesus the new covenant that did away with the old
i know  i feel it comin
holy diver  you ve been down too long in the midnight sea.. stay vigilant.
this is why we texians want to be a free and independent nation again.  the union is dead and has been for decades.  it turned that corner with the killing of jfk.
for years i prayed we wouldn t get the presidents we deserved because of putting god out of schools  laws allowing abortions  taking jesus out of christmas but celebrating halloween .
it is all upsetting  very upsetting  but you need to relax and just rest in god s grace and his plan. we already know things are going to get worse  the bible says so in the end times. everything is falling into place for god s plan. the rapture is soon  spread the word  love  and represent jesus. look up for our redemption draws near. do not stress  place your faith in god! we got this! love you all.
amen.
patriot nurse the firecracker is in the house! yeah buddy i love it.
thanks for typing words to a song.very creative.
americans and citizens of first world countries have no clue what people are like in less civilized places. in america  if someone gets in a bad wreck or accident  most people will be stopping to help. in india  and other crap holes people will literally record you dying  or walk by you like nothing even happened. in india  there was a horrible car wreck and a family was dying inside of the vehicle. people were just looking and walking by. there were also many times where i saw a husband beating his wife in the middle of the street with a stick or fist  and people walk by like nothings happening. i have a feeling eventually it will be like that here. we are losing our blessing from god quickly. most americans are cowards and too scared to stand up and say something. obviously this lady is not  thank you p n   god bless.
curses of the bible are now on those who have benefited as ruling class
i m jumping off my tiger now.  if i survive  i promise you i will be there for you.
this is still gods story  jesus is still upon the throne  but we as free men and women must begin to live in the holy spirit. be bold as lions isn t a description  it is a directive and command from the most high. this corrupt house of cards must fall  but from the ashes we shall rise. these may be birthing pains indeed  but do not only focus on the pain but also look to the father something is coming  he is coming
may his face shine upon you sister.
blessings from ks!
god rejected israel when they rejected his son. that s the point of the illustration of the king who sent his son whom they killed. jesus often taught physical israel would be rejected. we sit as branches grafted in
the god of israel neither sleeps nor slumbers!  peace to israel!  america is ripe for judgement!  we have become a godless society and i do believe we are living in prophetic times!   no one is going to save america!  but jesus is coming back for his people.  maranatha!
it s a coming lord protect the innocent
what is the  american dream   of course  every continent has its own version of the  local dream  of the european type  middle eastern type  asian type and others. if a person is a pagan or an ungodly person  in fact  almost all people on earth today are either ungodly or pagans   then this is more than natural for such people in their desire for a prosperous life in its richest possible form. they confirm that  the more money  the better  and even they are ready to die for such a dream.   man does not live by bread alone.  such people believe that they have only one life and will not have another  so they need to live this life as comfortably as possible and experience as much pleasure as possible. but sooner or later everything ends. the higher they rise  the lower they fall. somewhere slowly  and somewhere quickly  the current human civilization is living out its last days. the american dream is an example  if definitely not the best  then at least the biggest  concerning a person s dream of a comfortable and well-fed life. but even this american dream is fading into oblivion. desperate attempts are constantly being made to prolong its existence. the united states belongs to the so-called developed countries and  accordingly  they are already developed  that is  they have reached their peak  there is no further way  therefore  accordingly  there is no sense and motivation to go further  only the way back to the bottom. the same can be said about europe and some developed asian countries  where  their cheerful song is almost sung.  and as for developing countries  such countries have a lot to develop  because such countries have not reached their peak and they are still developing.and the so-called developing countries won t be able to enjoy it for a long time either. although the definition of the concepts of  developed  and  developing  is not entirely accurate in principle. but nevertheless. you are inside the system  and the system is inside you.  two boots in a pair.  and the world you live in is filled with lies. let your heart burn in the fire of truth for a while  and not your soul and body feel the coolness in the water of lies for a while. seek the truth while there is time.
america is already in judgement.
my understanding of the word of god is that when god is not pleased with a nation  he will give them foolish leaders so the people suffer. it seems to me that you are right  america needs to repent and turn back to god. we have sinned against him and turned our backs on him and his word.
we re in the situation we are not because we ve left god  it s because we ve left christ and his teachings  but i can certainly understand why you framed it the way you did. also  we don t owe anything to the modern state of israel  which spies on us and does deals with the chinese behind our backs. they re far from innocent when it comes to engaging in terrorism  and we re just as guilty. most of our  meddling  in the middle east has been at the direction and insistence of israel  i can distinctly remember netanyahu selling us the lies of wmd s based on their intelligence   and the pnac papers were largely a laundry list of toppling countries that are hostile to israel  and who pose no threat to us. that s how we wound up in iraq. i m not convinced that the biblical teaching of blessing those who bless israel is predicated on protecting what has now become the adulterated version of the original 12 tribes. our tax dollars may pay for palestinian terrorism  but they also pay for israeli terrorism  so as far as i m concerned  we should just stop sending our money to people who use us  and get out of the region altogether . we were energy independent a few years ago  so the oil argument is out. we don t need fake friendships like we get from the israelis  or anyone else in that region for that matter. we owe you all precisely nothing  and if we ever did owe you something  the debt has been paid in full.
read romans. this is what judgment looks like. we were given over a long time ago

the first  b  of prepping is bible! do that one first! prep the soul for eternity   then prep for the body for the temporary.
comfortable   soft .    the love of money   is the root of all evil.
oswald spengler s books the decline of the west should considered mandatory reading for for any christian. treat them as a lost biblical text. his books are more reliable than the book of revelations. if you want to know what is going to happen next in this world read his books or research him.
there is a huge difference between physical israel and spiritual israel.for he is not a jew  which is one outwardly  neither is that circumcision  which is outward in the flesh.  but he is a jew  which is one inwardly  and circumcision is that of the heart  in the spirit  and not in the letter  whose praise is not of men  but of god.
correct!
@thepatriotnurse all i can say is amen
i agree tax dollars shouldn t go to ukraine  but after its dissolution in 1991  ukraine became the third largest nuclear power in the world and held about one third of the former soviet nuclear weapons  delivery system  and significant means of its design  knowledge  and production.  who encouraged  facilitated  played a major role in the disarmament of ukraine s ability to deter and protect itself   let me know if you need a hint! then we can talk about the now required tax dollars.
for such a time is this! draw close to god! yes faithful!!
revival has come in several cities...and god said to julie greene a year ago that revival will start and grow and when you see this you will see the wicked judged! come will bring new life during these birth pangs and a new nation will be re-born!!!  thank god!!!
16 31 an american nation  americans more properly identified with their states  their sections  and their neighbors than some imaginary american nation.not everyone fit this description. hamilton  marshall  james wilson  and others believed in an  american people   but as john taylor later wrote  this is like a utopia for utopians. it doesn t exist.but  nationalism  is a powerful tool for one thing  power.  nation - a community of people composed of one or more nationalities and possessing a more or less defined territory and governmentwe have never been that!a 360  turn back to the original understanding of state sovereignty looks like a good thing.
i refuse to go to the dr since they nearly killed me with blood pressure meds
god has blessed this country...he has withdrawn that blessing  and will be returning said blessing to israel...just like the bible says it would     pray unceasingly...and repent daily.      lines are being drawn up...light and dark...evil and good...the republic vs. the demfacist.      more truth...not less.
all americans should hear this
do not send your kids to these people  war. let the games begin
too many boomers got comfortable and complacent  not thinking about passing on the torch of a good society  they chose opulence for them and poverty for their grandchildren  they are the greedy  entitled narcissists they call the younger generations. instilling good values is the duty and responsibility of parents  something older generations have neglected  including  the greatest  generation as they produced the boomers and gen x. millennials and zoomers are the product of their parents teaching. i have my responsibility to learn what my boomer parents never taught me so i have a fighting chance in this coming collapse.
so if one identifies as transgender   one fantasizes of killing christian s and their pups  wow. i am so sorry for the parents and i m so sorry for unconsciously allowing a group so immoral to manipulate culture in maniacal ways. as adults  we are failing the children. in jesus s name i pray  amen
that don t tread on me cup awesome.
jesus said  i am the way  the truth and the life  no one comes to the father but through me.  no amount of preparation will get anyone through the imminent tribulation but being saved in him will save you from wrath. the church being raptured is imminent for the lord said we are not destined for wrath. get saved and repent.
reaping what we have sown.
if my people  which are called by my name  shall humble themselves  and pray  and seek my face  and turn from their wicked ways  then will i hear from heaven  and will forgive their sin  and will heal their land.  2 chronicles 7 14
patriot nurse  i ve always been good at reading people. it s easy when you realize that most of us have a code telling us what is right for us  or what is wrong for us. when your religion tells you that you are of gods people  what does that make of the muslims and the catholics    my uncles  wife was an assistant rabbi and she talks in a similar way as you. forgive me for saying this  but it all sounds like many centuries of crazy that is not going to end any time soon. why  because your religion tells you that you are more special than the rest of us. this makes me think of the movie idiocracy.
i truly do respect and share many of this woman s values  but she  like most others on this site  just can t seem to break out of their  statist-mindset programming . a complete and comprehensive understanding of natural law and objective morality will always reveal to the thus-learned this impossible-to-impeach truth all forms of government  regardless of whether they re a so-called constitutional form  or etc.  are  by the very core of their nature ...  just one more goddamned evil  man-made system of human enslavement.
wow! wow! what people must hear!
god puts in who he wants. this country is in trouble because of sin and pride. god is going to burn this earth to the ground. it s coming. 5 years ago god showed me a famine we have never never seen  through scripture. better know jesus christ and i mean know him. stay in gods word
genesis 12 3 and i will bless them that bless thee  and curse him that curseth thee    in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed!!
i m sorry for your loss  and his wife s.
righteous anger on display here! our god is a jealous god and he will not permit evil to continue unanswered. pray for changed hearts because that will only happen through conviction not the feel good emotional sermons so many enjoy in churches today.
tuned in to henny penny once again.  calm down  the sky is not falling.  at least not right now.
you are one smart lady!
america s eclipse was a biblical warning sign for the nation to repent and turn back to god or face judgement a wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign but none will be given except for the sign of prophet jonah-mathew 16 4israel is gods prophetic timepiece and when it became a nation again after being barren for 1900 years  isaiah 66 8 was fulfilled and jesus parable of the fig tree began with the generation that will not pass before his return. psalms 90 10 states that a generation is seventy years unless by reason of strength eighty. please get saved in jesus and repent. rapture of the church and tribulation are imminent. getting saved in the tribulation will cost your life as a tribulation saint via martyrdom. they re destroying the waterways and 2 000 food processing plants so far. the mississippi  ohio and delaware rivers are contaminated amongst others. famine and hyperinflation are here. i would happily give more info to those in need  but please accept jesus for he said when we see all these things come to pass  to look up for our redemption draws nigh.
outstanding info information
this is a plan it is on purpose.
i like a lot of what you have to say  but the modern state of israel has no more to do with god s scheme of redemption than does china or brazil.
jesus christ is lord and savior!glory be to the father  to the son  and to the holy spirit.israel is christian
i feel dig currency is the mark
i understand your pain and frustration  and the injustice of what you have experienced.  my question  what did you think the end times would look like  faith is extremely important. the lord jesus told us this world would be destroyed by him. how did you think this would come about  christians  those who have accepted jesus as their lord and savior  will be taken out before the wrath of god. things could be very hard before that happens. my question to you  patriot nurse  where is your heart  is it in this world or the next  if you love this world  more than the next you need to do some serious soul searching. rejection of jesus christ is the unforgivable sin   a one way ticket to the lake of fire. search your heart and check your emotions. jesus is going to destroy this world  it has been prophesied. you claim to be a believer in god  be a believer and put your trust in jesus. selah
they are both alive!
@the truth  oh praise god! thank you for letting me know.
give em h 11 nurse. it s just another cycle cycling.
we are told if we live spiritual lives in this 100  moral world  we will be rewarded with a spot in a 100  spiritual kingdom in our next life.for the last 6 yrs  daily 24 7   we have been shown all the evils of evil men and the institutions they control. morally  we have been purposefully shown exactly who are enemy is for the last 6 yrs straight. spiritually however  that has allowed evil to convince us who our enemy isn t. when the pendulum swings back to the right  when all our wealth is sucked right out of our country in what will seem like an instant  what is going to follow is absolute carnage in this country. the  thing  on the right that is about to rise has been intentionally created  believe god has chosen them to clean up and save america  and who has been given any of 10 000 things and people to blame this all on  is going to have their vengeance believing they are doing god s work. it s going to be biblically ugly.
read the book of amos in the old king james version bible. it tells you what is going on. we are at the door of the rapture of the church and the tribulation starting. we have to totally revamp and change our education system with godly moral curriculum and godly teachers who believes the constitution and the old king james version  bible because the new versions are corrupt.
tell it  sister!
thank you
thanks again
spot on.
if i can t carry a gun there  they don t need my money. fjb

you look great by the way..   ..vietnam  the sacrifice made. at first we thought bought us 20 years. in fact  it probably bought us 40. to help us stem the tide which was coming.
from before ww2. look right after the fed reserve  1913   what happened  ww1  and its been one after another. gold made illegal to posess. 1930s . and on and on.
unfortunately i agree with you however we got what we paid for .cheep replica of good leadership
facts!am israel chai!
i quit paying money to the us government back in 2014.  don t regret it for a second.
we can all repent  for ourselves   but as for our nation  that is in god s hands.  we cannot undo the damage that has been done  we can only pray for mercy  and keep living the way that god wants us to. yes  it s horrible! yes  we are all guilty! we need god! we  desperately need him! i am not even sure if we get the righteous and good people in our government that we can turn things around to good. our backs are against the wall  we are between the rock and a hard place. our only hope is in god  and our lord jesus christ.   satan is having the time of his earthly life right now  it s heartbreaking and sickening   lord have mercy on our very souls!
i love your cup.

i really hope god gets fed up soon. i am so ready to go home. i hate what is happening  the corruption and darkness and evil is choking me. i pray that everyone who can see this evil happening will call on jesus to be their savior. he is going to call believers home soon and the 7 years of hell on earth will make this terrible time look like a party. please get saved  while you can.
huge protest going on in israel right now .
so  while you are getting all worked up  i am in florida - you are in florida - i say we get together - smoke some hybrid buds - eat some edibles and lay with eachother under the fool moon and stars and figure it all out - as friends from florida - play some music - and dance - yes - we will dance - what say you  nurse darling
please tell us something we don t already know
truth
it is already over.
you remind me of deborah in the bible!
i m so sorry.
not to mention countries rejecting the petro dollar to buy their oil.
i cannot worry about what is not in my control. what is in my control is my personal relationship with jesus christ  the law of moses  the only begotten son  the beginning and the end. without christ we are dead already. he tells us not to be concerned with tomorrow because we have troubles even today.
the truth is there if you look for it.
resist and do not conform or comply to the ways and will of this world .  there are more of us than there are of them .  this is the reason the complex choses to indoctrinate through the school  work  medical  and media .  i chose to be led by god   not a fool.
that s why haven t paid taxes in years  non of my    went to terrorists...
fear god not man
ummm  why is dave in israel    p.s i m a marine vet too
you better find god and get in his good graces. fast.

sounds like you re feeling like jeremiah
i agree we are all accountable but i don t agree that we have elected some of the people in power. elections are manipulated  long before we even hit the voting booth.
absolutely
hello greetings from ireland i am very sorry about your friends in israel   i admire your strong faith in god and belief in the 10 commandments i am more or less on the same page as you not sure that i would like to meet you on a dark night with your rifle i am roman catholic or at least trying to be the next video i watched after yours was  the  warning  could be much closer than expected! according  on jerome chong s youtube channel if you are interested a nun from wichita who has a youtube channel called marian news  made a video called  warning or illumination  god bless you
agree. the fallingaway into apostasy and  sin.   christian america is leading the world
yes mamm ..  i would say ..
8 00...  when you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers  let it be impressed on your mind that god commands you to choose for rulers just men who will rule in the fear of god. the preservation of a republican government depends on the faithful discharge of this duty  if the citizens neglect their duty and place unprincipled men in office  the government will soon be corrupted  laws will be made not for the public good so much as for selfish or local purposes  corrupt or incompetent men will be appointed to execute the laws  the public revenues will be squandered on unworthy men  and the rights of the citizens will be violated or disregarded. if a republican government fails to secure public prosperity and happiness  it must be because the citizens neglect the divine commands and elect bad men to make and administer the laws.   noah webster  history of the united states  new haven  durrie   peck  1832  p.6. men must be governed by god or they will be ruled by tyrants.  william penn when god wants to judge a nation  he gives them wicked rulers  john calvin
let s go zbrandon.
keep that passion and that fire. speak the truth  follow the commandments  fast and pray. follow jesus. the real sickness  the real death is sin.
judgement comes from the east
judgment   not  judgement
a stream of conscious
i found the bible s smoking gun exodus 15   3
sister...love your passion! are you familiar with the khazars and the ashkenazi  and their infiltration into everything
get your spiritual house in order! christ is coming back sooner than you think!
we need to confess our sins  we did everything by our will our strength and we need to repent  god gave us a savior and we need to get on our knees and pray  not our will but your will be done    we can t blame anyone without looking at ourselves  have we walked in the way of the lord    are we filled with the spirit who is our helper to keep us from stumbling . i pray for you and your friends family that god will hold you close in his arms  while you grieve and not let go until your able to stand on your own . there is no peace in jerusalem tonight they have brainwashed the youth there to rioting is going on. there are fires burning  pray for israel   when there s no peace in israel there is no peace in the world.   our constitution wasn t written for people whoms religion is not serving god. they cannot place their hand on the bible to uphold the law of this nation.  god bless you sweetie i m sorry for the loss of your friend my prayers are with you
beware of the military  industrial complex   ..... president and   general  dwight eisenhower  commander of the allied forces during ww2 .    why did we not listen

i am sorry for your friends  i truly am!  but i must say that america has been under judgment for many years now! ouote   have we gotten the government that we deserve  the situation we find ourselves in is the result of consequence!  words i have been saying on fb for years now! finally  someone else agrees! a government represents the heart of the people! you want a government that fights for your right to sin  then you get a sinning  corrupt  and criminal government! god will not be mocked! often times recorded in the bible  god gives the people what they want! america is now reaping the whirlwind of its desires! this is judgment! the majority of americans are now godless  spiritual seed of the serpent   doing the deeds of their spiritual father  satan the devil! they have been and are still giving form to evil by their thoughts and by their deeds! do we want a world without evil  then stop giving form to evil!what will be america s end  repentance and deliverance  or total collapse as  mystery babylon  falls  and she will fall  oh people! it is foretold and will not be undone! god is not a man that he should lie!lord jesus  have mercy on your people! let s be clear here  his people are those in the world  all over the world  who are in christ jesus ... only! the only way and truth and life!!! no one comes to the father except through christ jesus our lord! everything else is the types and shadows of the true spiritual reality! if you are not in christ jesus  you are not his people  period! the glorification of the body  in christ jesus  is the true promised land and not a physical piece of land in the earth! it was a type of the better promises! the church knows not any of these things  but the overcomers that jesus is speaking to in the  book of the revelation of jesus christ  have been taught these things by the father s spirit!a piece of new cloth can not be put on an old garment  nor can new wine be put into old wine skins! the old is not  good enough   and that is why it has been abolished! the old can not get the job done  and that is why we have the new! oh  lord  pour out your spirit of repentance on your people  upon the church and upon the world! because of your loving kindness  oh lord  i  we  are not consumed  for your mercies never fail. they are new every morning  for great is your faithfulness! the lord is my portion  says my soul  therefore i will hope in him! lamentations 3  22-24

there will probably be a day when you won t be allowed to make these types of videos. the censorship is getting worse. i pray that that day never comes.
i like your eyes.
with your right on rant! i would like to add some context that our decadent and comfortable people cant see!! i believe  we are in for a extremely uncomfortable awakening  first we need to ask ourselves  why did one of the greatest militaries in the world leave the taliban all of our military hardware  when the same ppl that left it knew we were going to back ukraine in a war  we could of just drove it closer!!   i think it is a payoff for a future we need you somewhere taliban favor!!!! to add to that why did the obama admin sell large sums of military grade rifles to the cartels in what we know now as the fast and furious program  i believe it is a payoff for future we need you somewhere cartels favors!! now the biden admin backed by obama allowing open mexican border give the cartels and china huge quantities of money for smuggling people and fentanyl across the border!! i believe this too is for the america haters to receive favors in the future!! i believe this is a well planned hostile takeover of our country  being performed behind the dollar destruction scene!!      our day of reckoning is here!!!!!
well...add all this to sharia law and we know exactly what comes next.
good.  let it begin then.

i beg to differ  look at pictures of detroit 1945  look at pictures of hiroshima and nagasaki 1945  speed up 2020. compare pictures of detroit to hiroshima and nagasaki! do the same with germany! do the same with italy  europe started these wars america ended them! thanks to people like henry kissinger ripping open the soft underbelly of america  and giving it to the world!
we are not under  the law of moses .   keeping the commandments of the son has great reward.
america  with all that you summarize sis  is under the judgment of god.  romans 1 18ff shows that we are guilty of all that paul tells us that god turns over those who do those things and affirm those that do them.
they  are called babylon in the scriptures. the scriptures tell us what happens to babylon. what you are saying about judgment on america is what johnathan chan is also saying. in the mouth of two or more witnesses.
your so beautiful
palestinians have been on that land for 2000 years. israel is dispossessing palestinians of their land so they fight back.americans have no business becoming involved on either side of this tragedy.
trump 2024 and the proverbial shit is gonna hit the fan. the usa and its great people will rise again. this canadian stands with you i have your six. it may be that we may have to take a stand against tryanny foreign and domestic.
welcome to end times and so sorry about your friend. the usa was not built on eloheim fearing men but rather freemasons.
i m not sure what version of the bible everyone else read but mine says that no man  beast or other living thing knows the time of judgement. so as long as people keep saying the end is nigh it never will be.also  god and the devil have a bet going for the souls of humans and since god controls when the end happens he isn t going to let the devil win so....using my knowledge of the bible we aren t even close to judgement day.for better or worse.
it s all an illusion
abraham lived 3000 years ago.  how do we know if the people currently in israel are direct descendants of abraham  isaac   israel    just asking for a friend.
we have to be fair  we send billions and billions of dollars to israel every year.  we also send billions of dollars in armaments and planes  etc.   we help israel alot.....
the terrorists are not from palestine you have that wrong. but no worries we all know who the real enemy is.
