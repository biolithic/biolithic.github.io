I put my faith in Jesus  not in people best advice ever. love it!

Im not a religious person but this was pretty eye-opening and made me respect you more for sticking to your beliefs.

its crazy to see the how positive the reaction to this video is. its a beautiful thing! thanks for sticking to your faith. God bless you!

I am not a religious person. that being said  you make a good argument for it. I find your faith very uplifting

I love how you are not afraid to share your beliefs especially in the world today. I also love how you can go on simpcast with women who dont share your views but you still treat them with respect. stay strong in your faith.

while I dont share your faith Im thankful to you for making this video. I reminds me there are some who worship but also have respect for those that dont share in the same faith.

you put my thoughts into perfect words. Im not religious and Im fully antI woke globalism  but I respect melonie s argument and faith as well!

as some who also isn t religious  I find this interesting. religion and faith give people a mean in life and a moral bedrock which to form. wokeism seems to devalue meaning in life and any moral value.

it is great to hear a God fearing woman speaking God s truth to the masses! keep up the great work! God will truly bless you in your life!

its nice to see someone so young with such strong faith.

melanie  this was profound! I actually paused the video a few times to copy down some of your thoughts. if I could reach through the internet to shake your hand  I would! thank you for not only having the courage to say what many of us are thinking  but backing it up with scripture. God bless.

love this. keep it up and dont feel pressured or embarrassed by your opponents. this takes actual courage in this day and age.

as a fellow Christian  I applaud you bringing Christianity into an industry thatshuns us. this is a absolutely fantastic video and the way you break it down is masterful. you are brave and you are inspiring. keep it up and ignore the demons.

thank you for this video. Im a fellow Christian and I see a lot of people not wanting to speak their mind and talk about the gospel for fear of cancel culture s wrath. Im guilty of this myself sometimes. but with everything going on Ive reached my breaking point. you ve inspired me to be more vocal. praying youreceive all the happiness you deserve.

truly the Lord works in mysterious ways. I watched this and was near to tears with conviction. as one who has stumbled off the path of faith  the Lord  through you has brought me back. like others have stated here  your faith is inspiring. thank you for sharing the video and the links to the discord for prayer as well. God bless you and your channel.

just when I think you cant possibly get more awesome  boom! you top it!!mad respect for keeping it and never shying away from speaking truth or keeping the faith. God bless mel

great video! you absolutely nailed it. its so nice to see you stand in faith and speak truth!

thank you for sharing the gospel so eloquently and encouraging accountability!  praying for protection  provision  and discernment for you.

melonie  I just wanna say Im glad to be a subscriber to you. you and many others helped me grow closer to Christ and to go deeper in my faith and not be so lukewarm anymore. never change mel. God bless.
