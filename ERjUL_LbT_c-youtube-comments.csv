i want my red tinted sunglasses  dual pistol wielding  puzzle solving lara back sooooo bad!
i don t think this is inherently bad-news for tomb raider. i think the greater issue for tomb raider is the design-philosophy and  creative  choices that are being made for this series. having resources stripped to go to perfect dark might exacerbate some of those fundamental issues  but this game was already heading in a questionable direction before this announcement.
the fact that amazon games is publishing tomb  raider is enough for me to say eww
i know i m asking for too much but can we just a have a tr where lara has the outfit and character from tr1  we get a cool story like tr2  the levels are set in different locations like in tr3  we get difficult puzzles like in tr4  the atmosphere from level to level is so different like in tr5 and lara is as badass as in trtaod
i don t want lara as a teacher. i just want her to  raid  tombs!!! i don t mind updated graphics and all  but only if we get classic lara style game. not made for a modern audience!!! great seeing you melonie. last night s stream was a lot of fun. and i think it cool that you re loading the game play on your melonie mac channel. you are amazing. and really cool friend. take care melonie. and have fun today!!!
i have hope now that dallas dickinson is the franchise executive producer. he is a classic fan and has talked about them respecting the original creators as part of making this next game and bringing back those huge parts of lara s personality that have been missing and that made people excited about her. i hope they will make this happen.
tomb raider the angel of darkness turns 20 this year. i miss the classics so much.
i m someone that has been a gamer for a long time but whose only experience with tr was with the 2013 reboot  which just came off as uncharted  the girl. never hated the series or anything like that  i just always had those games on the back burner as i was finding and playing something else. after watching your videos i went and got a copy of the first four tr games and you are very right that lara croft is a radically different woman in the two versions  i can see why you re a big fan of them. so thanks for getting me into the real tomb raider games  ms. mac. as for perfect dark  while i would like a new game  i don t trust big game devs these days so i m not holding out hope for it. right now i d much rather a physical release for the original n64 classic be offered for the switch
i agree with 2013 tr. it was so different  in a good way  but also feeling off. it was a decent game but did not really connect the same way with me as previous tr games. it reminded me of the difference between blood omen and soul reaver for the legacy of kain series.
well considering we ve recently had witcher blood origins  she hulk  velma  and willow  i imagine they re rename is womb raider and make lara an abortion doctor.
i never ever get tired or bored watching how unique you are. continue doing an outstanding job because it brings smiles  joy and happiness to us alllllll the time. never stop nor quit because you give hope   inspiration to us that want to achieve the same success as you. thank you for all that you do   give.
all i know is i want my perfect dark. perfect dark 1 is still one of my all-time favorite games.
i grew up admiring the real lara croft  the 10 10 stunner who kicked asses  solved puzzles  and didn t need any help doing it. she is  in my opinion  a better role model for young women because she does not force them to choose between competence and femininity  women can be both strong and beautiful. my younger sisters grew up watching me play the good tr games  and now the oldest one is a sea kayaking instructor  she literally grew up to be an adventurer  as inspired by the real lara.
i just feel sad every time i see whats become of this game  i seriously miss the adventure and discovery aspect of it... its just not there anymore. i want to see hidden places and discover secrets while solving puzzles  what i dont want to see is lara diving into a tunnel she has no place being nor having her team up when she has and always was a solo titan.
this is even more bad news for lara  i never played the classic games since i started with the lau trilogy  but even in that  the games were more enjoyable minus the family drama. i really hope that it won t be the end of tomb raider. and thank you for your videos and efforts melonie  who knows maybe they ll actually listen this time around and not give us a woke updated for audience tomb raider
some of your other videos make me think they ve decided the next tr game isn t gonna do well  so they re just moving on to perfect dark. but they haven t learned their lesson  so they re gonna ruin it  too.
have they ever done any sort of indiana jones lara croft crossover  even in a comic book or something  you d think that would be a natural team up.
keep up the great work miss mac  great videos and well pointed topics.
i liked the recent tomb raider trilogy. i d have liked it more if it had more tomb raiding  but i d love some classic lara.
now that melonie mentions it. even the original legacy of kain was a great story wrapped in a just pretty good game. i loved the original tomb raider and the next two sequels. the reboot was . ok. if the rumors are true. i will not be playing the new one. i have to confess i get a smile when melonie says  go boom!  it was my college nickname. good memories in both college and tomb raider.
yeah  me too. the reboot character may have the same name  and kinda looks a little like her if you squint  but it s not the same lara croft.
you re getting a rainbow-haired nonbinary a-cup and you ll like it.
along with souls-like customizable fashion outfits
dual pistols ... that s one way to put it
@toshineon  are we talking the current disaster reboot  or the legend anniversary underworld trilogy reboot
@xtarlina27  the current is the bad one
@xtarlina27  oh  right  i mean the current reboot. honestly forgot those games existed.
say what you will about the rest of the game but the puzzles were on point and there were like 10  of them per game.people say they want old-school tomb raiders but the best received of the reboots was rise. i ll just leave it there.
@user-gf3yp5ky3h  feigi said dr strange 2 will be pg-13 and you ll like it. at that time i know marvel will be disney 2.0 but marvel fans refuse listen to me
i imagine a reboot tomb raider game to have a jump button and then a grab button  r1 or r2 . game should be more focused on traversing and taking in the beautiful surroundings. theres no shame if its similar to uncharted because uncharted was inspired by tomb raider in the first place.
my thoughts exactly.
agreed  they cannot be trusted.
amazon has to keep there esg  scores high so amazon will pressure tomb raider to be woke
@falcon_by_the_lake  true  but who can today
100  spoke my thoughts exactly.
they re only publishing it tho  has zero creative influence on the game
thats sexist in 2023 lol
the avengers game should of been a single player game where you play a different avenger each mission. now that the game is shutting down  they didn t even get to the alien invasion dlc that they kept teasing with pointless extra content.smh
@mscapeh4451  to be fair  there has been one tr game before that was worse than anything that ever followed... the ps2 game  angel of darkness ... omg  it was so bad.
@jedipenguin2641  uncharted was inspired by tomb raider content story-wise  but it really dumbed down the exploration a lot. remember the precision jumps and flips you had to do in the ps1 tr games  i would really like the game to go back to this. i love uncharted to death  but there s no need for every other game to now just be the exact same.
i want a lara croft game lady doll  or at least see melonie do an unboxing of one
@toshineon  it was an awesome trilogy  i don t know why you hated it!  even the grittiness from lara s death scenes were a masterpiece kind of horror vibe  it would be a better idea that this next games were a continuation from that modern trilogy with better writing this time and lara s trademark ideas just like her braver attitude  gymnastics move sets and even her greatest weaponry gadgets such as her dual wielding pistols!!! this time cast a mature voice actor like gemma arterton - very british accent this time around
@mariajudith1895  to be clear  i didn t think the games were bad  i just didn t like lara as much as in the old games.
hellz yeah!
same  core design tomb raider lara croft needs to return to the main series not side projects like  lara croft and the temple of osiris  lara croft go and lara croft and the guardian of light. it s good that toby gard  lara croft creator  was involved in those to put the the spirit of the og into these games. but this 3rd reboot that became a trilogy has nothing to do with its source material  isn t canon and it s from an made up timeline  survivor timeline . i rather see what embracer do with tomb raider to bring it back where it used to be but some reason after square selling tomb raider deus ex and etc to embracer for nft s square somehow manage to purchase tomb raider back to do even more damage to the franchise by making lara croft into a lesbo smfh if these rumors are true but since square has been on a hot streak on making awful games i wouldn t be surprised. bcuz we can t have strong female protagonist that can hold her own these days without bring everyone else down 2013 trilogy is so bad she can t even do acrobatics anymore.
@user-gf3yp5ky3h
@user-gf3yp5ky3h  aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
keep dreaming
the  modern audiance  doesn t even play video games and i m not sure it actually exists.
you don t want trans  black lara  just think about how much stronger she ll be
@mrgunbunny13  i mean  isn t technically everyone alive a  modern audience   that phrase is just a bunch of fluff that doesn t actually mean anything.
@toshineon  it being meaningless fluff was kind of my point.there was nothing wrong with laura croft or tomb raider.just improve the graphics  tell a new story using a similar formula to the stories of the past and it will succeed.despite what  game journalists  will tell us  there has never been a point in history in which attractive women were unpopular.the ones who say otherwise are either jealous women or guys who don t like girls and i m tired of pretending otherwise. good story telling  attractive characters  intuitive controls and compelling challenges  will trump any woke nonsense.it always has.
@jonathandevereaux298  i really  strongly do not.
@chandlerburse2754  what part of  unattractive women and guys who don t like girls  was confusing media creators are pandering to a very small group whilst ignoring the ones who gave them their existing customer base.
@chandlerburse2754  two things.first of all  i ain t reading all that.second of all  pilpul aside  what  you want me to specify  no people
contact me for your reward
decent ! it wasn t decent! it was awesome!!!!
the most fun i had with modern tr was watching conan o brien playing and pretend to be simping for lara lol
i was fully consumed by the hype around the 2013 reboot too  but after a couple of years my disconnect with it also started to kick in.it s an alright game on its own  but it doesnt feel like tomb raider.the 2 subsequent games made improvements  but they still were far from what made me love this series in the first place.
@redacted2275  that was funny. i still love it though.
i like tr even dark angel a bit but the reboot tr made me loose interest in the ip because they ripped out uncharted where uncharted is already an inspiration of tr and indiana jones. the soul had left the ip and its unrecognizable unless you see the tittle .
awww  i wish we could get another soul reaver or blood omen.
@normanreaddis  so how you do the new rebooted game
@boboboy8189 why are you rebooting  is the question.og lara is fine it just need a good direction.if you re a fan of the franchise no reboot is necessary but a good sequel.
@jonathanpretty5031 defiance is a great end to the series imho.that canceled game  not the live service one  looks like it had potential but without kain and raziel it wouldn t work.
@normanreaddis  why reboot  every studios just want to . thats the only thing in their mind. they knew the game mechanic is out date and they need to keep up with latest game mechanic.
dear god hahaha
noooooo
lol
chandler burse  i didn t  someone else might have come up with a similar joke tho.
@normanreaddis  ok  then just remake them with better graphics and boom! instant classic  again.
@boboboy8189 changing a game mechanic is not a reboot.gow is not a reboot but an upgrade  so it can happen to tr. also if they want     then the need to make a game that resonate with the fans thqt stuck with you for decades now not  catering to the fickle masses  that ll left you drowning once a new fad comes.
@jonathanpretty5031 shadow of the colossus and demons souls says hi. at least it gets upgraded  nintendo on the other hand is still milking decades old games without dropping its price.also the modern day upgrade remake is for the new adaptors of the game to appreciate the classics in their age. only a die hard fan will buy it every time it got release which is totally fine but if it s just a port  that  fan  becomes a consumer. there s no point of buying it again if you already have the exact same thing. you re becoming a cash cow at this point.
@normanreaddis  i meant a remake like demons souls or sotc. they re both fantastic  despite being the exact same games as before.
it was a reboot  genius. it wasn t meant to connect to a thing.that s what a reboot is.
@jonathanpretty5031 yes they are and tr remake can be great as well. tlou remake is a cash grab.
@normanreaddis  yeah  i was annoyed at the  remake  of the last of us. what a pointless waste of money. it is a great game  but it s been remade twice already.
i really liked 2013 tr and the sequels but  those were my first real tomb raider games. growing up i watched my friends play the ps1 games  played a little of 2 when my family got a computer  and then anniversary when i got it on steam. i never had a ps1 and by the time i got a ps2 i was in a mostly japanese only phase for a while lol.
@jonathanpretty5031 they re recuperating from the underwhelming reception of tlou2.
well we gave them a pass on the character change because it was a supposed origin game. then they teased us with the dual pistols at the end. in the next game  completely disregarding that and going back to the pick axes and saying that  they are her iconic weapons now  was a massive slap in the face.
@jedipenguin2641 bait and switch my friend  bait and switch.
@chandlerburse2754 tlou  remake  is definitely a cash grab to hype the ip again because of the underwhelming reception of the 2nd game. and tlou2 s  new feature  is basically uncharted 4 s new feature.
@chandlerburse2754 mostechanics of tlou2 had been done by other games even better  like the dismemberment of dead rising. and it was almost a decade now. interaction with hostile enemies is also the blueprint of uncharted  also the inclusion of the vast section in game is uncharted. even the jump is uncharted lol. the only new feature it had is the guitar mechanic. that s it.
@chandlerburse2754 i would rather them to go back to their roots and make a jak and daxter game. but with the status of their company  i don t wamt it right now.
@chandlerburse2754 well it s not the first let s just say that. the direction is still fulled it down drastically.
woke version of perfect dark though
me too my friend  love perfect dark . always will. growing up on goldeneye and perfect dark they will always hold a special place in my heart. sadly i don t have much faith though for devs nowadays    just feel like they would ruin it
@mikeslemonade  yeah that s likely to happen unfortunately.
@user-qk9be9ik5n  oh i m sure they will ruin it. perfect dark zero was ruined. i only enjoy the nightclub level of that game  the main theme song  and the final boss theme. also enjoy that bosses existed  just didn t enjoy the actual boss fights. the co-op mode was pretty cool though compared to the originals co-op.
@mikeslemonade  catered for modern audiences   perfect dark aka perfect woke
@user-qk9be9ik5n  most of the time it s not the devs fault it s the higher ups that usually make the bad decisions like microtransactions and progressive storylines.
perfect woke will be meme
perfect dark zero was horrible. the original is an amazing classic. the only way a new perfect dark game would be good is if it s a rebuild of the original. same missions  characters and story just with a graphics overhaul and updated controls.
contact me for your reward
i could do without the endless enemies and  like you say  more solo exploring through epic ancient tombs. need those lonely  awe-filled chills back.
at the very least the guys at epic rap battles of history could do a video with the two of them.
lara in the beggining was so awesome  i as a man wanted to be like her... now they showed her into the woke shredder  which then spitted out this unrecognizable character
awesome updates. fast become one of the best content creaters. my opinion. really hope game companies wake up.
i honestly hope both the new tr and pd turn out to be great  but the odds of that happening are... not good.
melonie  for real  you are crushing it lately! you ve uploaded a host of new boom! videos all throughout this week! there was a livestream last night! you uploaded to your og channel this morning. now there s this new boom! video today  and possibly even more streaming later today as well  just a month ago you were battling dehydration  now you re drop-kicking life like a boss! i love it! seriously  thank you for all that you do   if you ever feel like what you do isn t enough  i hope you ll take to heart this quote from walter ciszek   for me  each day came forth from the hand of god newly created and alive with opportunities to do his will... we for our part can accept and offer back to god every prayer  work  and suffering of the day  no matter how insignificant or unspectacular they may seem to us... between god and the individual soul  however  there are no insignificant moments  this is the mystery of divine providence. the fact you re trying to live your life for god and proclaim him in your videos means none of your work is insignificant. you ve touched and helped so many people  so i hope that you know that your hustle and hard work is worth more than you may realize. keep being you and keep planting seeds
shadow had good tombs. they were on par with the old games.they missed a golden opportunity. they should have made her crazy. she definitely had something wrong with her. when she flooded that city because she had to get the artifact because she was the only one who knows all about it. she obviously didn t care about those people.
currently on a ps1 tr marathon  just reached aldwych in tr3 . i hadn t played these games in around 20 years and i can t get over how refreshing it has been to actually have to work stuff out for myself. then again  i m not the  modern audience  that everything is aimed at these days. tbh i m not overly confident in the new perfect dark game either.
honestly really enjoyed the new ones myself.   theyre nothing new or innovative but theyre good at what they do and a worthwhile play.   third one is the worst of them and its still a great experience even if the story is kinda meh.   really liked the character development.   made her really flawed as a human  which... i mean...  thats just a logical evolution in her story.
man  i miss choosing when to grab a ledge! when i think about how good lara s gymnastics and climbing could be in a modern game... these interactive movies are annoying. they aren t even survival games  either. i don t understand why so many companies think sprinkling in a bunch of different game genres will attract fans of those genres who will be happy. i would prefer for lara to look  sound  and behave more like her original self  but i wouldn t even care much as long the gameplay was back. the funny part is the original wasn t exactly the most demanding gameplay  if they add the difficulty settings that they ve been adding  an actual improvement to the series   basically anyone could handle it.perfect dark  zero was the only one i ve played removed  and it was bad.
i d love to see your thoughts on the bl series  including tiny tina s wonderland  in terms of it s trajectory.
keep up the great work  mel.
i love how many people were celebrating when it was sold by square.like  i m not gonna say square didn t miss-handle  the franchise. but i find it funny how many people were celebrating prematurely.
as someone who s a huge fan of the original perfect dark  as well as goldeneye 007  lets see how it goes.
i m guessing lara s design will get the  updated for a modern audience  woke
sounds like more management issues behind-the-scenes  which is a common thing in the industry. at the same time  tomb raider has already been hurt by the  modern culture  vibe and perfect dark is at risk of the same treatment.
tomb raider it s one of my favorite franchise s it s a shame where the franchise is heading at this point. it won t never have that magic it once had. not a good sign seems it s being rush. thanks for the update content melonie.
i want to see a classic lara crossover with the witchblade universe come to life
i would love to know the conclusion to the legacy of kain series from crystal dynamics
i just started shadow of the tomb raider 4 5 years late  i know. and wow it is totally lady uncharted and the cut scenes are relentless. i finished tr and rise and i m going to get try and get through this to complete the trilogy but if the next one is more of the same  i might play it when its on sale for  5 years down the road.
i agree about them  continuing the  survivor timeline  it would not feel the same  without  lara saying   its an ancient tomb
tomb raidee  the message  will go over as well as that last saints row.
this really means a lot  thank you     had a rough end to last year  but this year i m not playing around! haha!
totally can t say any better than otterloop keep up the best melonie huge inspiration
f.r keep seeding gamer s everywhere
@meloniemacgoboom  i m convinced its not a genuaine melonie mac video unless you mispronounce something and that stephen  otterloop  and a few others are here offering you support in the comments. i think i like otterloop s grammar and heartfelt encouragement the most tho. seems like a cool guy whose out to really support you   not insult u like others do.
lara  the living fossil species extinction event that walks  croft acted like a maniac  say it ain t so.
you ll be begging for some minor hints when you start tr4  that game does not explain shit to you and leaves half of it s mechanics unexplained.  why thank you game i did not know that i had to press action on this door to open it while underwater and running out of air thinking i had missed something  in fact this is the first time you re expecting me to do this despite already having long cleared the tutorial section of the game.  also don t get started on those fucking skeletons in the crypt in the second half of the game or the lack of directation in those those open ended levels or that rope swinging mechanic.
she ll be a strong independent trans lesbian black woman.
that already happened lol
@meloniemacgoboom  indeed  i remember that disaster
@polishtamales lmfao
i actually hated the reboot. i loved the first game  i was seeing her start to grow into the tomb raider character that i knew and loved... then.. the growth didn t happen. in fact it went the opposite direction  lara literally was responsible for killing so many people. she had no confidence. she just kept crying that she would fix everything when she only kept making things worse.also  lara being a teacher  she s becoming indiana jones. if one of her students puts  love you  on their eyelids i will give up on the game.
i actually quite enjoyed 2013 then the definition addition then rise then shadow  can t wait til they add to the series
i liked how in the last few tomb raiders you raid zero tombs  literally.
i use to watch my college friends play the original tomb raider games. never played them myself but they were sure entertaining to watch.
most of the devs who worked on the og perfect dark are on the timesplitters team now. going into very low expectations for this new game.
crystal dynamics   amazon   rushed   another dumpster fire.
never seen anyone love tomb raider as much as me. i ve had every game since the beginning.
i hope they don t pull an angel of darkness  tomb raider   lara are way more popular than perfect dark   joanna dark anyway... hopefully they focus on tomb raider.
so what you re telling me  is that they re so creatively bankrupt  that they ll abandon a re-imagining  mid-butchering  to move onto another nostalgia grabbing re-imagining for the modern audience
i feel like this is embracer group testing crystal dynamics to see if they can deliver which is why they allowed cd to partner with amazon for the game. i feel like if this games doesn t do well profit or review wise then i feel like embracer will either make crystal dynamics relinquish tomb raider to another one of their companies or they will put the tomb raider series up for auction for another company to buy. the main reason that embracer group bought crystal dynamics was because of tomb raider and the fact that embracer group wanted to remaster and remake the older games for newer consoles shows that they care more about classic lara and tomb raider more than cd. also a tomb raider classic collection for nintendo switch  xbox  and playstation would make them a ton of money especially if they included the gold editions of tr 2 and 3 and it wouldn t cost them a whole lot to make either which is what i think embracer group is trying to push cd into doing since they probably know the next mainline entry is gonna flop.
i d like to see tomb raider 1 3 remade like resident evil 2 remake was done!
just rewatched the tomb raider movies  angelina jolie . i was wondering if you have done a review on these. would love to hear your take.
are you gonna do a vid on bruce straley being unhappy he was not credited in hbo s the last of us  he was heavily involved in the creation of the original game and was left out of the shows credits. probably worth doing a vid on
i think crystal dynamics can develop a good tomb raider  they did that with anniversary which i thought it was great. but they don t want to  they want to make tr a mass appealing 3rd person shooter that sells 10m
i liked the old tomb raider games
i play a lot of games for different reasons. warframe has incredible mobility  black desert has incredible combat  mass effect has an incredible story. if i want puzzle solving  hidden object games are fun. i sort of feel like a good tomb raider game needs all of these things. i believe the unreal engine 5 can do it all in the right hands  including proper facial animations for expression and speech. i don t like what crystal dynamics has done to lara croft at all. i love sassy  bombshell  gymnast  double gun-toting  innit to winnit lara croft. i need a good dungeon crawl game with lara and not sure there is any developer out there who can deliver what would feel great to me  d. i m so picky!
tomb raider is the more popular franchise  there is no way they will neglect it due to a less popular property.hopefully lara will be back to her confident self now we have done the origin stuff.
i can t wait for the announce  im gonna laugh my ass off
joanna dark  seriously  i remember pretty well that that battle was won by lara croft in the 90 s
they already have d tech t make amazing games  both tomb raider and perfect dark...we just need devz that hav d mind set to respect d originals and are fans or even passionate about working on such projects and properties........im sick of woke hacks getting put in charge of stuff i luv
i got 3 hours in maybe.
agreed  the real lara never emerged  and nothing of interest happened after 2013.
didn t they changed studios for third game  as far as i know people love rise of tomb raider although for me that game is meh because less puzzle but shadow of tomb raider has puzzle back
the tomb raider reboot was spectacular.a full sandboxed rpg style origin story for lara.it was amazing. 10 10i even liked it better than last of us and unchartedand lara was almost a male character so she was almost meant as a b grade indiana jones
yea idk why they went that direction it was promised lara would become closer  to the original by the end of the second and third games but it didn t happen...hugely missed opportunity..
their ultimate goal is to represent lara s brave  stunning journey  to transition for their gender-fluid  bipoc life partner  just to spite the rich  white  cis parents who had the audacity to bring lara into the world without lara s consent.
chandler burse  well he s probably not wrong  as long as someone will fund it. point of both scenarios though  would be that they appropriating these franchises to bank on the pre-existing popularity  to package whatever nonsensical message they happen to feel will get them the clout they re self-entitled to.
@missrubberbutt  oh  well said!
that s what fans have been requesting for years but cd doesn t care and will probably never get proper classic remakes other than re-remastered of the reboot trilogy or stupid dlc content for other games like fortnite.
tomb raider has fallen off dramatically and severely underperformed with its last two installments. while perfect dark as a whole is not as popular as tomb raider  microsoft most likely is going to put a lot more investment into it than what we re getting out of a seemingly rushed tomb raider sequel
can t wait for perfectdark
i have very little hope for anything getting released these days.
i m sure the next tomb raider will be great so long as lara spends the whole game trying to become the person she s meant to be when mowing down hundreds of enemies while acting like a frantic teenager stranded by the side of the road with a flat tire.
tomb raider has always focused on presenting a cinematic experience. the health-smith brothers has always alluded to this.
keep up the great work melonie!
as a gay person the leaked script sounds forced. also  protecting artifacts and teaching people sound like the exact opposite of laras endeavors. i liked that you point out a crucial difference between the old games and the new. she used to be a power fantasy anti-hero  now she s a good willed hero. those things are like the opposite.
i still play the original perfect dark on a n64  sometimes i don t care about   definition   and frame rate on this game as the story  the game play is still enjoyable along with the sound track  yes  nostalgia  i love it  the new perfect dark that came out was awful  perfect dark in name only  not spirit.
finally! more tomb raider news!
i feel like big cinematic single player experience games just can never be the money makers that publishers wish because selling a title once is just not a business model that can support those sorts of budgets. look at elden ring  considered a massive success but financially it won t even outperform whatever ea s latest pay to win fifa title brings in. it won t beat diablo immortal. the big cinematic games are often profitable  but their margins are tiny compared to games that keep the audience playing and paying forever. idk how to overcome that.
hi  i just saw you here for the first time  interesting commentary!i was never into the original tr for the simple reason that... well.... i absolutely suck at puzzles. lol  and what i did see in advertising and so on showed that the game was just full of them.  while i m on the fence regarding tr 2013  i did see the cinematic for it  and i m intrigued by it  since i m someone who does like a story-driven game - and as you commented  it looks like it runs along those lines.  i like the idea of her character  as you said  even people who didn t know or play the original tr did know lara croft  even though the original game did look too puzzle-centric for my personal taste  and the cinematic for it looks to me like an origin story for her.don t know why i felt the need to tell you all that before asking my question  but there it is. anyway  here s my question   you mentioned in your video  several times  about you doing a deep dive on the character and series.  i went to your channel page  and i see several videos that you ve done that talk about the tr franchise - but i don t see anything labeled as a  deep dive   so i m not sure which one i want to check out to see what you were talking about there.  if it s not too much trouble  could you post a link to that deep dive video   thanks!  i look forward to checking out more of your videos.
i m so done with the dead parents thing! i m so over it! it s been beaten to death  pun intended!  for so long! keep them alive and disowning lara croft like in the original!
tomb raider and perfect dark were two of my favorites back in the day. i have nothing but doubt that pd s new game will be anything but woke garbage  whereas the original was intelligent and fun  and a great script. just started replaying tr  legend  and that aspect of puzzles and fun just seems lost int he new trilogy  and so i m sure they will double down.
nail in the coffin for me was the 2nd one. not shadow. they changed her face  and put her in an environment where she had the most clothes. shadow  i still need to finish. played for a while and felt like i wasn t having fun.
i m sure of it now that embracer group practically forced crystal dynamics to stop supporting avengers yesterday. this tomb raider better be the real lara croft and not the sympathetic fem raider.
original perfect dark was sooooo good
changing the engine doesn t mean that they throw out everything - actually most of animation  textures etc. can be easily exported to ue5
i dug the first two tomb raider reboot games  but this new lara is nothing like the og lara.  i want them to bring that lara back  but if you ve been paying attention to which way the wind is blowing in the games industry  you know the odds of that aren t high.at least fortnite got her right.  the blocky  psx era lara  legend lara and reboot lara all look great.
great watching your videos again just graduated army basic training  osut keep up the great videos
honestly  i have higher hopes for nicobass  fan remake of tomb raider 2.
as soon as i saw this  i thought  i know someone who will be all over it.   i was right.
chandler burse   i never fought for anything. she s on the snowy mountain so she had a big ass coat. most of the outfits were related to coats. it was lame.
chandler burse  you didn t play the diffinitive edition with all the outfits. it was on sale for like 17 bucks on xbox when i got it. i said  most  not  all . some outfits had midriff  no sleeves  just a thermal shirt. so your point is meaningless.
chandler burse  yeah. i m really mad i got more clevege in my rated e sly cooper game as a child  than my rated m tomb raider game as an adult.
i m afraid that it doesn t seem like that will happen anytime soon.
i like a good story driven game that can be a movie. but i also just miss older games. maybe unrelated but been playing all the main resident evil games again or the remakes. and loved the older games and loved the reboot  re7  and village when it came out. but replaying them was kind of boring  ones you know what s coming it feels like a ghost house park ride you ve been on a dozen times and all the scares you see coming and just bore you. i miss games that where more challenging like old re and old tr.
holding out through three games of we re making lara croft into the tomb raider she was always meant to be only for that to mean a sad lonely lesbian  sort of makes me feel like i got played.
i also don t like the newer tomb raider games as much as the older ones  but i think they are at least better than the uncharted games. at least none of the tomb raider games give you a hint if you take too long trying to figure out a puzzle  as the uncharted games do.
the only way they can regain fans is by having a dedicated studio who are fans of the og tomb raider and give us a remake of the original tomb raider similar to how they remade re1 and re2  bit of both with some tweaks and changes to gameplay and graphics  and prove to the community they are worthy of making another lara croft adventure.
i am so conflicted on this as i love both tomb raider and perfect dark. and i ve been waiting for any updates on the pd reboot since its only trailer.
maybe because i got older and life is more complicated  but i never got to play the last 2 tr games... i need to make time for this  but i don t feel compelled to. i don t know if they are good or not   but  since tomb raider legend  i believe lara croft go is the most fun and i can even dress her in the original outfit.
perfect dark well  hopefully someone out there will remember flashback.
i can t wait for neil druckman s tomb raider.
i agree  the new tomb raider games are uncharted with a bow. i miss the mobility  back flipping while shooting dual pistols and the fun enemies like a t-rex or tigers. now it s just humans.
looks like their  capitalizing  on the dlc of her home in the game power wash simulation.  but no classics remastered or remakes.every other game is getting remakes   remastered but lara.
i just want to put my fantasy for a tr game on here. dont take it serious  i want crystal dynamics to lease the lara croft char. for one game to ubisoft for an assasin creed tomb raider crossover. it takes place in modern times. shes hired by abstergo to find the apple of eden...hilarity ensues
when was the last perfect dark game   i remember the original on n64  then they made another one and i remember it not doing well.
i miss the big sound tracks  like from tr2...   temple of xian and some other levels.. venice..  and maria dora...those sound tracks gave you goosebumps... very lacking in the last 3 teenage lara  games .i d still love to see cd make  anniversary edition releases   of tr1 gold   tr2 and tr2 gold  t3 and t3gold --- using...  the same game engine as  anniversary  legend  and underworld.if they produce it separately from the  new stuff  ...  be funny to see if they dare release say... tr2 gold vs whatever new stuff they come out with...you d really see which one sells better
lara is probably  differently abled  and needs her students to help get her wheelchair up the ancient tomb accessibility ramps
kinda off topic but ashley in the re4 remake is looking fine
feel the same with rainbow six the rogue spear period was gold! rainbow six 3 from 2003 was the last real rainbow. the vegas games were classic but after that it s fallen off. and yes i know vegas was much different from the early games but they still felt good and a new look on the classic tactical shooter.
i still have hope tomb will be good
well considering the train wreck that game of thrones became when they decided to rush it to devote more time to a new project  i am positive that this will be a train wreck from the get go. i don t think i will give this game a chance until it is on the  20 rack  if i do give it a chance.
with tr2013  i thought it would be a prequel instead of a reboot  but i don t tend to look at  deep dives  or even  making of.  i thought at first   ooo! a young girl who goes through a traumatic event that leads to her being the badass of the other games!  separating the girls from the women  kind of event!  i only got to the end of 2013  so i was like  eh  it s just how she got her dual pistols  but maybe that s all it needs to be.  i haven t played the other two games  even though i own them on steam. i probably will end up playing them at some point  and maybe just tell myself it is an au like devil may cry and that single dmc  reboot   which was a fun game but a shitty story.i m also bummed out that there are many awesome female characters out there  but companies make the new stuff that sucks  and then go  oh! you don t want female characters  we understand now!  and then scrap good characters  which then leads to cries of  sexist gamers   when it is not gamers  fault. it s bs to not even point a finger at the company. if they made fun games with great mechanics and likeable characters  male or female protagonists would make bank. nintendo is getting this with samus and bayonetta! when they tried to reboot samus into  whiny weak girl  gamer men were pissed off to hell and back with gamer women who didn t like  other m.  so the whole  men don t play games with women characters  doesn t and never did hold water  yet that argument still gets yelled out similar to  vaccines cause autism  or  flat earth.
i liked the old games and the first 2 of the rebooted games even tho they feel kinda like uncharted but i m not really that excited for a new one
perfect dark zero was a xbox 360 launch title.
to add to d.  s reply  zero came out in 2005.
i mean r6  siege shouldn t even be called rainbow six. it has nothing to do with the rest of the series.
@toshineon  agreed! it s a shame what s happen to the series.
they hate her for what she is  but love to use her like a working girl if they re short on cash. thats pretty messed up tbh
i never could figure out why the perfect dark series didn t get more games. as far as lara  i won t be pre-ordering any more tomb raider games and i bought shadow when it was marked down to half off.
i never got passed the first level of tomb raider 2 as a kid lol
imagine if embracer funded hired core design . . .
how come the guys who did hitman did the game right after absolution  and did it with continuity up to now  and they take advice from fans. how come this can t be done in the tr series  which is a recognizable iconic character and has a huge fan base in gaming like agent 47  yes i am a hitman fan and i like tr too.
gaming in general has taken such a movie like approach that an entire game can feel like one big marketing trailer. if you can make it look cinematic enough to capture the wonder and awe of the audience which is possibly enough to get them to preorder at least  then why bother improving on the very cog wheels that are responsible for the gameplay at all. to hell with triple a i say  this kitty is putting his paw down.
the first 2 tomb raider games were aaa for their time  especially the second game. after that  the games became less and less popular. also  the character was always more popular than the actual game.
i didn t play video games as kid so i didn t play old school tr  the reboot was the first tr game i played and loved them   but if it s gonna not please the real fans   i think the best thing to do is ignore the new tr. they just want you to talk about their game good or bad   as long as it s being talked about  it free advertisement   not talk about will hopefully tell them no one cares about your game
honestlty ive never expected the perfect dark reboot to be good  xbox already bended the knee in 2009  which showed both in the gears of wars   halo franchise. as long crystal dynamic has to answer to a third party who is still loyal to the cause  an authentic lara croft tomb raider experience simply isnt possible to  my opinion. together with tifa   jill valentine  lara for these people are their ultimate evil. and sadly lara also was their first big win  which gave them the momentum and confidence  to push on. even sarkeesian admitted that she didnt expected it to be so easy to turn the gaming and casual communities so easely against lara croft tomb raieer and its fanbase and terrorising her o.g. creators. so im sure all hell will break loose whenever an serious attempt to make an authentic experience is in the cards.
joanna dark was my lara croft. if they mess her up  too  so help me...
on the topic of game franchises that have been gone for a while  what are your thought on the new ncaa football game  gone since 2013 as a result of the keller v. ea lawsuit
it d be nice if a crowd fund could buy it from these companies that dont care and put into responsible hands.bummer to hear theyre remaking perfect dark too  i cant imagine itll be good coming from microsoft
tomb raider announcement! romancing lara croft     dating and dungeons!
id love to see a modern perfect dark but not one for modern audiences if that makes sense  a perfect dark using all the new tech we have and things weve learned  rather than just oh look hey heres perfect dark isnt it good  now give us all your money peasant!!!
wait  they are bringing back perfect dark i don t think microsoft would go as far as giving that franchise to another developer outside of rare or the people who did the killer instinct game who also knew about rare games.
i love how  woke  stuff gets made for  woke  crowds who never even buy the product.
i actually really enjoyed the reboot series  but understand why most fans didn t....
tomb raider turned into an uncharted clone bring back the atmospheric puzzle game that made lara an iconic figure
perfect dark s writer previously worked on star trek online and destiny 2  and is one of the people who is  leaving twitter  because elon musk bought it. she also retweeted a tweet implying gamers were  abusive like elon musk  but that she works in the gaming industry anyway  implying she doesn t have a very high opinion of gamers in general. i don t have high hopes for the game at all.
calling it . this will be the  velma  of the gaming world!
that said..... these rumors are.... just.....  nothat is not lara
this!
good afternoon  melonie! hope you re having an amazing saturday. you look stunning today.
to me it sounds like they are making another on rails shoot-em-up arcade game that you can play at chuck e cheeses or dave   busters right next to tomb raider arcade game...perhaps  oh dear
this won t end well ..
sort of off topic  but have you watched any of steve of warr s retrospective videos on the tomb raider series  melonie
tv shows  movies and video game companies trying to make character lonely and sufferable so people can relate. they need to stop doing that. even if people can relate it s just make people more depress. i like character who s workaholic rather than miserable. like the show inside job.
oh no  will it be good. probably not. you look super cute melonie. looking forward to the next live stream
we still don t know what the game will be like so i m a little relieved
it has to have a  good story good game play because to me graphics aren t everything
not a tomb raider person but i feel ya on the disappointment. some of my games were resident evil  tenchu  which had some similarities with tr   twisted metal etc. and all three of those franchises have fallen hard. not a whole lot of games get played around here anymore.
the stream was fun last night! lol
is microsoft that incompetent at managing their developers that crystal dynamics needed to take lead on perfect dark from the initiative  kinda embarrassing man
as a perfect dark fan  i do hope that the road bumps aren t that big and that it doesn t become another ufamaed franchise...
every time you hear about tomb raider news your heart must suck because you know it s not good
used to play a lot of pd back in the day.honestly don t know if a new pd would even be good. pd was a product of the graphical limitation of it s time. a modern version wouldn t play the same. seems like the same problem that tr has. maybe what some people want is a d-make  like the ps1 version of bloodborne.
you know what would make me excited   a triple a game company that advertised it had fired every employee that exhibited social justice principals.   and only hired people based on merit.
speak for yourself!  i ve played all tomb raider games. i was 16 when the first one came out. i love the new direction and think it s a lot better than the old games.
the skepticism is warranted... given the trends of  updating for a modern audience   we may as well just prepare ourselves for a 10 hour cutscene game starring a masculine female who we should go ahead and start calling him  larry croft.
yo! when you mentioned modern tomb raider being like female unchartered  it made me think death battle  lara croft vs nathan drake
i have no faith in the future of tomb raider or perfect dark in this climate
i love perfect dark!joanna is next on the woke chopping block eh
tenchu!  one of the pioneers of stealth action.
@falcon_by_the_lake  i believe it was the first 3d stealth game.
yup  just bury it for a while already instead of making things worse
@meloniemacgoboom  that makes to much sense  so u kno they will beat it to death till they wouldnt b able to pay ppl to play it
perfect dark is a great game but really needs a remaster first then see how it sells. i have it on 360 but honestly still haven t finished it. gameplay was too goofy for me.
about  time
it could be a good thing provided that we ll have another post angel of darkness moment where the game suck so much that it gets handed over to a new developer.
...laura croft is exceptional...
would you humor us with a cosplay of an anime-style classic lara croft
mel   it does not look that great  tombie. is that what tomb raider fans call one another
how about a comedy tomb rider tv show with melonie as lara croft just saying.
this breaks my heart. tomb raider has such a huge appeal with girl gamers  there isn t really any comparison. they should have leant into that. i don t get why they don t listen to fans  instead some woke soy-guzzlers have hijacked the direction of these games. it s not right.
will mindy kaling become the new laura croft
cd have been the devs for 17 years now so it s going to get worse i believe you might as well have janice from aod take over and go block pushing lever throwing and canoeing up a roaring croc infested gorge shooting up tribes people and casually murdering any poor fools who are stupid enough to challenge her then she goes pinching their golden idols laughing  proudly as she inters it into her prized trophy room as she pats herself on the back for the 6th game in a row for being so damned iconic...please make this the game please! it couldn t be as bad as what they re actually proposing...
hi melanie. i hope you re having a great day. i was wondering if you could do a video explaining why you stopped doing the verse of the day  if you did i missed it. if you didn t  could you please explain why  i really miss that. i m not judging or anything like that. just wondering and missing the verse of the day part of the show. god bless you and your family. duane.
we need new studios. every time they fuck something up we need to correct it... v_v just wish i had the skills  time x money.  xd
well now there effing with perfect dark  i guess its a good thing i have an emulator of it for the n64. also melonie i just need to point out that i love how you rarely curse. i love that you use hecking instead of other 4 letter words. so i just want to say thank you and much respect.
well  i removed next tomb raider  and perfect dark from my list a while back.so  is what it is.
the problem these days is lack of creativity.  instead of companies making their own cool stuff they re like  oh that game did pretty good.  maybe if we take one of our popular franchises and make it in that style it ll do good too.  and if it doesn t at least people will buy it because of the name.  but make sure you got your checklist for  modern audiences .  lmao.  if crystal dynamics went back to the greatness they had doing soul reaver they could actually make a great game  but i don t see it in these times.  you ll get that one wacko who cries about something in the game and then ruin it for the hundreds of others who actually buy and play the games.  mwuahahaha.  i m ugly af!  why is lara croft not ugly af too so i can see myself in the game!
wasnt perfect dark just a goldeneye clone  i never played it for that reason
we need another soul reaver title or livr action movie
it s sad to see tomb raiders fandom drop over the years. the ip isn t really popular anymore. they need a solid hardcore reboot
it seems like lately any news for games is bad news. when s the last time there was good news
honestly im more worried about microsoft ruining joanna dark like they did before with perfect dark zero than lara croft
i reflexively shivered in disgust  lol.

it can be done as a purely fanmade project.  mind you  you may take 14 years  as crowbar collective had to put in to produce black mesa  half-life remade in the source engine of the sequel   or may require less.  depends on the patience and persistence of your fellow team members.
without amy henning i doubt they could craft a game that matches the heights of soul reaver 2
somethin  of a spiritual successor  it was.  it did throw in some new features  and from i ve read since... geez  1999  !   the enemy a.i. is hella good and fun to fight.
i m actually super stoked because they are no longer owned by square enix who is notorious for sticking their fingers in development and screwing things up.   shadow of the tomb raider was hamstrung to start work on avengers  and given how that went i think they took it personally and made a mediocre game.  now that they re free to concentrate on the game over the monetization and marketing  maybe we ll get a good tomb raider game.  same thing goes for eidos montreal and the deus ex franchise.   we re finally gonna get something untainted by shareholder board meetings and goal projections that are insane.   square did all of their western partners dirty for years and they still put out servicable  mostly great products.
they tried to make a legacy ip like perfect dark so pc half the dev team left lol
i hope they do not mess up your game starting over means they already screwed it up fingers crossed
the most recent lara croft games aren t even tomb raider no tomb raiding puzzles or fun its just her fighting mercenaries in the jungle its basically a farcry game now.
while it ll be nice to see joanna again  they should focus on lara first.
when all hope is lost  in nicobass i believe in you.
this all reminds me of the stuff that s going on with halo.  it just suck that we may see the end of both games soon.
of course it s going to be bad.  practically every franchise is being destroyed in succession.  they are running out of things to attack with their  modern  ideals if they are going after perfect dark.  that wasn t even very popular when it first came out .
i would buy angel of darkness with fixed camera issues.
i didn t have any hope of it being good in the first place after all the comments we ve already heard about the new tr.
i wish i could play tombraider but crystal dynamics ruined my entire experience
i like crystal dynamics  tomb raider trilogy.
i hope that japanesse studios are just great.
resident evil 3 remake flashbacks  hopefully not  but when they cut or rush things because of another game  it does not end well...
i initially played the three ps5 games  reboot  or whatever they called it   then played the originalsman  they really butchered her
i m sorry but i really enjoyed the latest trilogy of tomb raiders i thought they mix the gameplay with action and the puzzle element inside the tombs
perfect dark  what is this for  all five people who played it
so anything but tomb raider part 4  i can hardly wait. do you feel my excitment guys
i ll agree  tomb raider back then didn t seem triple a  she seemed more like double d.  sorry  i couldn t pass up on the joke  i miss bombshell lara
i think they need to make laura croft again and take out the politics as a side thought it would be awesome to see melanie as a character in the game
i miss the feeling of getting excited about tomb raider news    been a fan of the series for a very very long time but i m really starting to feel like there s no hope for tr unless they completely restart it. i kinda wish  lara  died at the end of shadow lol
i just ordered the 2nd tomb raider trilogy for the ps3 can t to play it sunday
oh  it s bad news for  perfect dark  fans  for sure... joanna dark is just one step away into sjw-ism... we can t have womanly women according to wokeists  we probably can t have androgynous women too.like you said  not messing with  avengers    good. the same goes to all three lolthat s what makes me sad  nuance is dead in the minds of these people and a franchise or classic characters are just a means to an end for them... nothing s safe in their hands  it s impossible to give the benefit of the doubt to people who don t deserve it and to people that proved they don t deserve it so much.
no perfect dark was announced first crystal dynamics put tomb raider to bed perfect dark was announced back in 2021
i am so sorry for your loss.
i really loved the reboot trilogy personally. i agree with most of your thoughts about how they gutted croft s character a bit  but i didn t even hate the idea that she was young and less confident. sorta like   these are the adventures that built her confidence  sort of thing makes sense. for the same reason i think her being less of a thrill seeking grave robber when younger also makes sense to me as it allows them to set the scene that this is where she got the thrill seeking obsession. i didn t like what they did with the backstory and they didn t need to make it  save a world scale threat  though. also  i think for me the scenics were just so spectacular that it really drew me in. when it first came out i loved the first one but i can t replay it now because older me can t deal with the camera shake that you cannot turn off but rise and shadow i mostly love.  though i felt there was too much combat in rise . i loved the challenge tombs in shadow as those felt like the closest thing to old style tomb raider but in modern graphics that they came up with to date. as someone who has been playing tomb raider games since the first game hit mac in 1996 i would say i enjoyed rise and shadow just as much  if not more  than any game that they have come up with to date but i always assumed that confident lara was coming in the future. i also didn t mind the visual change just because personally i m more attracted to a  climber s body  look than a super curvy look but i totally understand why it would be considered a downgrade to many.that said  if the next tomb raider rumours about the story are true  it sounds fucking awful.
if it s not indie or imported  we will most likely see more of this woke shit in our games.
i ll take a lego tomb raider game. i wanna play something that isn t crap xd
as a lifelong zelda fan  i can relate. breath of the wild fundamentally abandoned what zelda had been for almost 3 decades. gone were the massive dungeons  incredible puzzles  and tactical combat. in its place we got a dark souls lite.breath of the wild is a perfectly good game  if you like those sorts of games. i ve never said otherwise. but what it is not  is a zelda game. again  there is nothing wrong with the game itself  if you enjoy that style of game  i do not . but nintendo basically just slapped the zelda name and characters onto a new game for them. i d like to tell you to have hope for tomb raider to go back to what it was  but i doubt that it happens. i used to love the tr games myself as they were spiritually similar to zelda titles. but they lost their way even before zelda did.unfortunately games are made by bean counters now. cookie cutter copycats trying to chase the success of the most recent best sellers is the norm now. games that are built from the ground up  for fun  from an amazing idea are fewer and farther between amongst the big publishers.
i thought the newest trilogy was  fine . i thought the combat was good enough  the difficulty scaling too  the characters were mostly annoying and the story was very lacking.
atleast we re getting a tomb raider game
i loved the original perfect dark  would be very disappointing if they fucked it up.
hey  melonie i just want to tell you that i just wanted to see how the new tomb raider video game goes bc i just want to see how lara croft can find treasures in each tombs and finish her late father s journey before he got killed when lara croft was a young kid back in her childhood days  ok melonie. anyway also i just want to see how the new perfect dark video game is like before i tell you   anyone who wants to know bout it  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to tell you what my thoughts are bout the new tomb raider video game and i just want to tell you what i think bout the new perfect dark video game  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. p.s. i just want to tell you that you are doing a fantastic job with your streaming videos on twitch and on your youtube boom channel. anyway i am so happy for you for making videos on your boom channel and i am so happy to watch you play video games on twitch too. anyway god bless you and god bless your hard work that you do for your fans like me and everyone else who follows you on twitter and twitch and on your youtube boom channel. anyway have a great evening and good night melonie.
as someone who is a fan of perfect dark and tomb raider this stings. i just hope joanna doesn t get a  modern  makeover
regardless of what everyone is saying avengers actually had potential the game was fun
how much  updating  of tomb raider before tomb raider is no longer tomb raider
i have no hope for tomb raider anymore. until it s out of crystal dynamics  grubby hands  nothing will change.
melonie is lara croft.
if a tr game doesn t cause you to be stuck for a day or two figuring how to solve a puzzle  it ain t tomb raider
hi melonie can they just stopdestroying everything we lovein life.
appreciate your support towards my channel contact me for your reward
we ve already been there sadly  it s only going to get worse from here
if they insist on changing everything about lara croft  why not just make a new game series  calling this tomb raider or calling this new character lara croft is just an insult to the history of the franchise we know and love.
i ve done the classic original timeline tr core design games so i m not a hardcore fan but the games since 2013 don t really interest me  it looks like an uncharted clone and for modern lara one word. boiring.a aoe sequel would very much interest me though.
melonie... i m scared...
rise   2013   shadowi want a remake of tr2i would probably buy anything tr related unless its 180  in the opposite direction of what tr is
i ll give you coordinates in the arizona desert.its 3 days on foot and that s what you got .3days a portal and on the other side the same desert.seems crazy seeing 300 years ago..the night sky is lit up by lights that move.strange days.adventure we won t let be a lost thought...
please let the new tomb raider game be closer to the originals. i miss the pure adventure of the old days.
wasn t there a witchblade tomb raider comic book crossover where the two complimented each other often enough that we d be forgiven to assume they were bisexuals   i mean  it s not impossible a notion  but it s not a notion that fans readily adopt.  also  it s not the point of the game as you point out.  the surface trappings of drama and cinema are used because those are the more accessible chunks of the game at least for public shareholders.  and everybody at the studio is not really into these ideas.they re just playing along because someone said that esg is a financial safety net against failure  a very real prospect that everyone takes seriously in large software development companies.  people are disinclined to take risks and the whole esg racket says you can look good by espousing melodramatic acceptance of every crackpot notion.to be clear  tomb raider  at its core  is a cinematic platformer akin to out of this world  flashback  blackthorne  or nosferatu  but in 3d and starring a gorgeous big-tittied brit with two pistols and an adrenaline-addicted death wish.  the kind of gal you don t bring home to your parents  because at your parents  in their very presence  you d succumb to boffing her.  you don t need to embarrass everyone for nookie.and since all that also sounds backward  the developers assume they re doing themselves a favor as well as everyone else.p.s. since you always look oppressively pale  maybe you should cosplay as death of the endless year-round.
with a little less oversight hopefully they can slip in some organic lara.who am i kidding...
i would have to see the game  play first before buying any of the games
i don t have any faith in crystal dynamics. maybe that studio should be shuttered like volition. i do agree that tr started out as a platformer and has long abandoned that in favor of aaa pseudo-sneak shooter maybe they should go back to scratch.
i ve never had an xbox  but always wanted to play perfect dark. still  tomb raider forever!
been hanging out with millionaires  watching videos  on youtube for a long time  and they say  if a formula is working  you never change it!!  these guys are probly straight out of hollywood types that make stupid movies. but i did think the new tomb raider stories were alright but i would never play them. watched the game videos.
what happened to videogames  they used to be fun. or maybe it s just me.
i loved the reboot  it s actually playable.people are fooling themselves if they think the older tomb raider games held up any to date.they were good back then  but are almost unplayable today. and i see people complaining about puzzles.... did you even play the new tomb raider  there s def plenty of puzzles. real puzzles. not just running back and forth on a map til you figure out you need to shoot a bell with your pistol.
dora the explorer is the shift they made melonie.  they made lara croft  dora the explorers little buddy  cute instead of badass.  is that what you are saying
lara will be the vessel for woke character creation. a  make ugly b  possible lesbian c  praising the occult
i wouldn t be surprised if this game gets ruined as well  especially if they re rushing to finnish gameplay.
i m gonna pretend i didn t hear that
i wish that crystal themselves would have done shadow though. it was by far the worst of the  trilogy  in basically every way  and i think it would have been significantly better if crystal had done it.
unless games companies start listening to level headed women like yourself  old lara will forever be hyper sexualised
@@te-legram_meloniemacgoboom   i m good i m more of a humble person but i will keep watching your videos
they sadly became mainstream.
prefer a good tomb raider game rather than a rushed out mess that will be forgotten about.
2 5 2023i m old school tomb raider gamer.i have been playing video games since i got my first atari system back in 1978.anyways  it s truly sad how a once top-of-the-chart franchise games like tomb raider is being watered down to total nonsense!the game needs to go back to square one from the early days!all the ps1   2  games were classic gold!that s where i spent hours  days just chilling out in the old-school versions.the newer game is more boring like sitting at a long movie.also  this is the first time i have ever seen your channel.i will subscribe and look for more tomb raider reports from your channel.
hey talk about the tomb raider netflix series
the story for shadow was a snooze. too much focus on her and her male companion s feelings. i just found it whinny and pathetic. i agree the puzzle aspect of the much earlier tr games were great.
this is not good for either game perfect dark reboot has been in development hell for years this spells trouble for both games
it seems to be just some random user that throws some stuff around  hoping it sticks. i don t think crazyera even checks to verify  insiders  anymore. if someone like jason schreier says it  then i m more willing to believe it. i dislike the guy  but he knows his shit.
i am sure lara croft would be a trans binary fish with the reboot. you know to make it more modern and accessible to people today.
i ve purchased every tomb raider game to date... but  if those rumors are true  i m done.
in classic tomb radier  lara has already be doing what she does for a long time. in the modern  games she s just starting out  it s the beginning of her career  so to speak. so maybe this is how see was at the beginning  but as she gets more experienced  maybe that s when the acrobatics come into play. and maybe the more she deals with trinity always getting in the way  her attitude will change and she will be less of the girl next door and more of the lara croft we all know and love. this is just my opinion and understanding on the differences between classic and modern. i would love to hear everyone s thoughts.
yellow wall are the  you re too stupid to...  of gaminglet me fall a few times devs! !
i m a big fan of the survivor trilogy  it was excellent in most respects. the gameplay was nearly perfected. the puzzle solving was still there  just moved to the side so it doesn t stall the game unless the player wants to. the only real downside in the survivor games was the lack of a cohesive story between all three entries. i don t believe rolling back the depth and realism that lara gained in those games is the right path  but there s a lot of  modern audience  red flags in those rumors. after embracer s saints row reboot debacle  i d expect them to be really concerned.
this is wrong. the reboot wasn t bad on the roi. the survivor trilogy has just under half of tomb raider s sales. with 38 million sales. they just had a slow start. even if that 38 million was sold at an average of  15 that is hundreds of millions of dollars in profit probably  we don t know the cost of the game . the 2013 reboot was 94 million dollars  assuming a similar cost throughout the trilogy. 570 million earned vs  282 million cost is  288 million in profit. could be better but not a failure.
oh god please dont ruin joanna too like they did lara.....please  i hope it wont get seasoned with woke  and downgrading x.xbring our legend back long braided ponytail and all
just render the first game! give it the re 2 treatment
if i created a franchise like this or perfect dark  i would never ever ever ever sell it to anyone else. nor would my indy company ever be sold to anyone. these things are passions. why are these idiots selling them  if my franchise failed  it would fail under my control. no one else s. to sell what starts good and see this industry sully it like that  it would be a regret i would have the rest of my life. what the hell is going on
absolutely love the reboot. better in every way..
i was a huge fan of perfect dark for n64. zero was underwhelming. the trailer for the reboot looks like a climate change psa. my expectations are already rock bottom.
tomb raider was like zelda without the open world part.
looks like angel of darkness now has a competitor for the worst tomb raider game by the sound of it.
omg. they got two money grab name and still f it up.
every single tr that crystal has done is snooze fest and overly dramatic. they have ruined her character in so many ways.
no chance  crystal won t re-remake the first tr. we ve got anniversary and they sure won t be remaking other classic games given they hate classic lara.
why you ask  money... simple as that. it happens many more times than you ll ever realize. does not matter if the contents end up getting butchered overtime as long as it keeps earning money and sets you for life.
the last tomb raider was a big let down. not sure if a new one even interests me.
the only legacy franchise that did well since 2017  remained consistent and not ideologically subverted legend of zelda super mariometroidresident evilfire emblem i can t think of any else. i was so happy to see that samus aran doesn t talk feelings in hallways  in fact saying 1 sentence in a foreign chozo language. woman of action. which is what made it all the more funny when kotaku writers cried metroid dread was too hard  just wanted to  experience the story ... baby doll  metroid is not about story  never has been nor ever will be. it s all about gameplay  gameplay  gameplay  exploration and isolation  level design  enemy and boss design  and controls. i was also super happy they didn t release journalist mode til near 6 months after release  so journalist mode would ve been irrelevant and too late.
0 46 white tr 2013 i want a new one tr2 2023 or 2025 only ps5
there is no  new  tomb raider.there is classic tomb raider and legends tomb raider. that s it.
dig after dig after dig   pun intended
to be fair  2013 was a long time ago. the new games are for the new generation not the og fans. and the recent generations have been sooo ... not gamers. any game with any semblance of difficulty is just watched on twitch. story driven   walking simulators are all the phone addicted  yolo-gens care about.
meh  i liked the first two games of the new tr trilogy. really didn t like the third one. to be fair  those are the only tr games i ve played
square enix and crystal dynamics hater tapping into say i will no longer support anything from them especially after marvel s avengers
i suppose for many tomb raider fans  this shouldn t be good no bad news. seeing as this will likely not really feel like tomb raider  but rather a tomb raider knockoff game  featuring a bland lara croft knockoff calling herself lara croft.   seeing as this is how it s felt for years  the only thing to lament is that there hasn t been a new real tomb raider game in ages.
the guys that botched avengers are going to make a tomb raider... yaaay!
i don t like that this is happening  but i d rather this than what they wanted to do to indiana jones. at least lara croft is canonically a woman.
tomb raider underworld was the last good tomb raider for me.
nah  amazon will claim tr cost  1 billion to develop
as a metroid samus aran fan  i do not envy you tomb raider lara croft fans... i m really sorry tr fans. as a metroid fan  i know how well we got it with metroid samus returns and metroid dread.
modern gaming...
ugh i hate what they do with our icons.  they use ip to sell us bad games like they did with final fantasy 13 where an edgy sword wielding soldier and a black guy with a gun fights a robot scorpion.  then they make a very talkative master chief fight something that is  far worse than the flood  on a bland open world map that  looks so much like halo ce.   wonder what lara is gonna end up doing
the best modern  tomb raiding  game is still skyrim
sounds more indiana jones than tomb raider
i played older tomb raiders after the new ones.... maybe its just what you started with  but i like the newer games a lot better than the older ones.
i can t even pay attention to the subject of the video. i m still bamboozled how people can sit cross-legged on these office gaming chairs....
my first serious attempt at clearing a metroid story was the original prime .  it was such fun - all about gameplay  as you cited - but i never finished and i had to sell the gamecube and games to help pay bills.  this is my videogaming albatross.
@falcon_by_the_lake  prime is good  damn good. doesn t age as well as super metroid or just 2d classic metroid  but it s still damn good. love to get an hd remaster on switch for it.
there is only classic tomb raider in my book. the legend trilogy was so babied down it s insane  but aesthetically looked good at least
i liked the thailand level and bits of mexico  for the rest if was pretty bad imo especially towards the end.
also why does lara sound like the new indiana jones teacher by day and adventurer by night
all i can say is  if they          lara lesbian  and i do stress that word make   i m done. i don t really have a problem if it s optional  but i      have a problem with it being forced. and the agenda is soo obvious. i also hate the idea of mentoring giddy acolytes and turning the entire premise of the game upside down. lara was a raider  a thief.. now she s a.. an sjw. smh a plague upon thee  embracer.. amazon!!!   _
i loved the reboot  would love more of that.
amazon games nope i m out i ll stick to classic lara
this is why whenever i get a tomb raider itch  i will only play tr 1-5.  anything  aod  and beyond is not a tomb raider game.
i say build tomb raider from the grass roots.
perfect dark for the n64 is my favorite shooter. the multi player was amazing  and the weapons were creative and fun. and there was that little alien elvis. soooooo good! the next game will be trash just like every other game.
i ve never liked tomb raider  once i played the game  i couldn t find anything interesting on it  and the last ones  are terrible games. i don t have high hopes for the perfect dark game  time splitters is the true sequel to pd.
no more gotg either
i have zero hope for the future of tomb raider. my childhood teen self is rolling in his grave but i haven t been a fan since 2010. the franchise died after guardian of light for me since the reboot titles are completely different games and lara is lara croft in name only. i enjoyed the 2013 game for the setting  the rare sections of the game with no action and more emphasis on exploration  but it suffered from what eventually turned out to be recurring issues  bland boring side characters and villains  dumb plot  too many collectibles  mercenaries overload  scripted action sequences  and lara being constantly unlikeable  lame  and a far cry from the charismatic sexy daredevil woman we know.
why dont they remake the old tittles  keeping the mechanics but giving them better graphics  it sounds like a no brainer to me  but then again execs nowadays seem to have no brain at all...
perfect dark only has one good gamethat s far from iconicit was also basically just goldeneye but cyberpunk
i really liked the rise of tomb raider and shadow of tomb raider.
tomb raider 2013 reboot wasn t lara croft
i like all the tomb raider games  with the exception of aod . i have bought them all. as long as they don t get woke on lara and turn her into a black lesbian  im fine.
they re about to ruin two games  aren t they
i personally don t care who does the next tomb raider.if it s as good as the last 3 i welcome it with open arms.
dude. the new reboots are sooo much better then the old tomb raider. these are some of the best games ever. and i much much prefer this lara to the old one
didnt even know there was a new pdark game. all the games journalist channels turned into politics  .
i always imagined lara was bisexual  so the girlfriend announcement doesn t bother me.  plus  if i want to watch a beautiful woman kissing anyone  it s another beautiful woman.  the  teaching students  bit sounds pretty sus but i m willing to wait and see.  thankfully  for me  i have the benefit of only becoming a fan with the latest trilogy  so nothing feels ruined for me ... yet.
so  they are doing the indiana jones tomb raider rip off from the 1990-2000 s staring tia carrera  relic hunter. because they wouldn t give tia the rights to do a tomb raider show.
remaster   you mean  right remake is what square enix did with final fantasy vii  and capcom with the resident evil rereleases.
is this real
the people wanting reboot lara to be bisexual somehow never include any romance with men  they only ship her with women.
lol relic hunter. i remember watching that show as a kid.
as long as it s believable i m down for any changes. tomb raider needing help with a world ending issue  ok  no problem with that. she s just one woman and last i checked she wasn t super natural by any stretch
tomb raider  survivor trilogy was great. og lara croft was mary sue rey decades before rey existed. no flaws and perfect at everything. lara was even perfect as a kid.you are literally being a hater
she s a teacher. wo!
is tomb raider gonna go woke
i recently stumbled upon one of your gamestop videos and your voice sounds soo differently in them - why
so pathetic that there scared these days to bring back classic tomb raider and classic lara s appearance and sex appeal which she owned and made her a very powerful female role model in how bad ass she looked
it sbeen only bad news on the tr front for like decade now
i have no hope for ours beloved og lara tomb raider game . i have the impression we going to see that new reboot imposter for goddamn while sadly  not going to lie i m sick of it
very off-topic  i know  but...  aren t this gal s arms the epytome of beauty   physical perfection!
if we hear the words we dread to hear that s a red flag at an automatic hopefully nit
perfect dark... probably more like the perfect mary sue and simp adventures
i cannot defend the concept    we must stop defending the  good people at the company that just want to make a good game. . they are complicit in the destruction of lara croft. there are better companies out there that respect their ips. if they want my respect they need to work for another company. i ain t yelling at you  but we really must not give any breaks to these people at all. they are destroying our favorite things.
i don t wanna see perfect woke.
amazon .
the game is called tomb raider not tomb protector she s a grave robber the shift between characters for the new generation is not really gonna make game makers a lot of money they still is on   go woke and go broke
give me deus ex
there gonna tone her down
ok maybe it s because i haven t seen all your videos  but how come you don t read comments anymore
i truly like the 2013 remake  but the other 2 in the series are not that good.i mean i don t hate them but not love them either
have you heard the latest about gamestop that @camelot331 is reporting on
tell me you didn t play the old games without telling me you didn t play the old games lol
@melonie mac go boom  well  you re right lol  nothing more than the demos on the playstation magazine. the very first one i think  where you had to kill that tiger  idk i barely remember the demo that much. i couldn t get the shooting down and that tiger was too fast for me at 5 yrs old.
if you think she was a mary sue then it proves that you have neither played the older games or even simply just familiarized yourself with her as a character.
@charmingpeasant9834  actually  i did play the original games. she was a mary sue. even melonie portrays her that way. matter of fact the old lara was modern woman  i don t need no man  before that was even a thing.
was adding way too much bloat to my videos and i wanted to put more time into focusing on actual topics. you must not have watched for quite a long time indeed as i have changed this several months ago xd
@meloniemacgoboom  i was busy at times.
perhaps lesbian lara croft   or all girl girl adventure in new tomb raider
i rather play horizon zero dawn for similar game. i m starting to think square enix just dodge the bullet by selling tr franchise lmao.
well the game industry is sucking hard almost as bad as the movie industry.  stop supporting these game developers and publishers and let them learn the hard way.
tomb raider 2013 is the best one.
square enix is outta touch
i bet that game is going to flop really hard.
the tomb raider franchise died when they stopped making lara croft sexy. i haven t played tomb raider in years. we need a new franchise with a sexy female character like lara used to be.
sippin  on dat haterade.
avengers is done...
where is the netflix anime
i challenge you with mariokart
you say  hecking  because you watch tucker budzyn  don t you
amazon games   no buy.
hey melonie
not stonks
lara would have been better off at nintendo.
shadow of the woke.
lmao i dont want to sound like a hater xd
it s a bunch of crap that they still haven t added the old core games to modern platforms outside of steam.  i do not buy their excuse for a second.
modern tomb raider sucks. i like the free ps4 one the environments look crazy  i agree everything tomb raider sucks now. hope prefect dark is good though  zero was ok not the best though  not any good or better either but zero was ok for now. that s not saying much rn lol
they absolutely did lol
donezo xd
well as an old gamer that has played every tr game i will boycott any game or movie that makes a gay lara
can t wait to see black lesbian falesia croft so cool.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand joana in perfect dark will be gay! probably... maybe. xd idk.
is this 2023  how can i still be making games this bad i mean  i get the bad woke stuff  that is always on purpose. but crappy graphics  crappy gameplay  tech issues . . . shouldn t technology be passed this by now  we are going to be going to mars soon  why can t we get decently made game
did they asked gamers  no we just never wanted to look the girl of the next door and that ugly no the only thing thats left is braces
tomb raider is a beloved ip. it must be destroyed.
written for a modern audience    means written by post-modern introspective nihilists.
gaming is slowly dying
great. even indiana jones doesnt mentor students. he dosnt even menotr his own sun. thats not who indiana jones and lara croft are. you thought tr corn was bad now just wait with her being a teacher. this is just horrible. but i guess i shouldnt be surprised. as a gamer all i can say is f  k my life. i guess ill just play my old games that they cant take away from me.
comment for tomb raider
tomb raider 2023 lara croft  born larry croft  is a transtesticle  multicultral  non binary  pronoun warrior  with an androgynous avatar
rise of the tombraider was great
i m glad they re leaving the avengers in the past. they keep ruining marvel. i don t need that! leave it alone  already.
woke raider and femenist dark fate
love you
wokie aliens  sucking the fun and life out of gaming again  .  and i agree. that auto grab is wack not tomb raider. hogwarts legacy goty
perfect dark was only relevant as an upgrade from golden eye.and 90  of n64 owners still dint play it. useless ip.these game companies have no idea lol. i want deus ex but theres a high chance it will just be garbage. i predict eido s banking on the wrong franchises and going under again.tomb raider lol.....perfect dark lol... who honestly asked for this... use your brain and bank off cyberpunks failure. gamers are starving for deus ex. tomb raider would need an 11 10 for me to even look at it. i find the character incredibly boring.give us deus ex
deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex  deus ex
yet again another series going in the trash now back to warhammer 40k while 2k burn to the ground along with ubisoft and square enix .
another crappy movie game which isnt surprising. people are getting tire of that type of games specially knowing how fast those games low their prices in a few month after release.
lara croft another dead game.
you just know it will be woke garbage no thanks
2013 tomb raider is the only good one in the reboot seriesperfect dark was always meh on the 360
new tomb raider is just another uncharted prince of persia ripoff.
xbox is ruining evrything first perfect dark halo and now tomb raider fire xbox managment
the tomb reboot lost me its sexist to men witch i need to make a video about.
i loved the last reboot....well the first two. so  tomb raider is gay now....ugh. the entertainment industry has become a big cliche now. trying to outwoke one another.
i think it s about time they destroy another franchise we love  with a woke non binary transgender and black lara croft or her daughter or something
first
marone
the look on ur face on the cover tells me the pure disappointment u have  sorry.
you will hate me for this but... fuck tomb raider. perfect dark is more important to get right
i would enjoy seeing a trans person of color play laura.
sounds like they re trying something new with the new tomb raider  good! nobody wants the same old same old recycled crapif we wanted classic tomb raider we d play classic tomb raider
as a big tomb raider fan or follower they killed the franchise when they gave tomb raider to cyristal dynamics.
telegraph
tomb raider hasn t been done right since 1999  i am fine with it being on hiatus for a while instead of running it to the ground more. the fact that crystal dynamics is working on perfect dark is terrible news too  i don t want to see that ruined like everything else crystal dynamics touches
