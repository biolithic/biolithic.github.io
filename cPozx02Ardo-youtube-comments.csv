people only want male superheroes  all the wonder woman fans who are mostly male btw   are we a joke to you
wasn t she basically a female superhero in buffy  hope you re having a wonderful day  melonie. you look fantastic
she literally played a female superhero in a show with so much cult status that people still have viewing parties  especially with the musical episodes .
didn t she come from an era where female action heroes were in high demand  buffy  xena  charmed  relic hunter to name a few  gee  it s almost as if people like watching an entertaining show with a good story instead of propaganda...
buffy is an iconic character that smg happened to land and turn into a phenomenon  she was originally brought in to read for what became charisma carpenter s role  cordelia chase . if she doesn t see that it takes good writing and casting to create good heroes  male or female  i don t know how to help her. buffy works because she s relatable to a wide swath of viewers of every background. i m not a blonde haired  green eyed woman  but the struggles buffy faced i can understand and sympathize with. smg brought humanity to a  superheroic  character through her performance  and joss whedon  yes  i know he s a terrible human but he did create buffy   marti noxon  david greenwalt  jane espenson  david fury  and countless others write her in a way we can all enjoy.contrast this with today s writers that think the women they write for have to show out against men and need to have  grrl power  moments all the time. she can t just be powerful  she has to be more powerful than any man. she can t just be smart  she has to be smarter than any man in the room. truly impactful negative consequences for actions don t exist for her like they would a man in her place. she doesn t need training  she s already amazing out of the box. this kind of writing is terrible for a man or a woman  and yet with women in media these days  that s what we get. they seem to think we still can t accept a powerful  charismatic woman can exist  when we ve loved those types of characters for decades... when the writing is there for them.so no  sarah  it isn t that we only want male heroes. we want well-written heroes  regardless of their sex  and would very much like writers rooms to catch up to the way we ve enjoyed women in films from the late 20th to the 21st century. they are where the  backwards way of thinking  comes from  not us. buffy summers  sarah connor  ellen ripley  lara croft  cara dune  countless anime heroes  countless video game heroes... figure it out hollywood.
i never used to have a problem with female protagonists  it s just that these days  they re all such cookie cutter  girl power  man hating mary sues  that i can t help but roll my eyes the moment i see one.
as a kid i watched xena warriror princess  of course i found this out after watching hercules. i liked both hercules and xena warrior princess. it was funny and i liked the mythos. it did not bother me that xena was a woman. she was actually pretty good. lucy lawless did a great job. several other heroes came out  that were female. you have red sonja  ripley  electra  laura croft and so forth. i liked all those heroes. if they come up with more heroes  that are actually worth while to see  but they have to have a great story. these new female heroes are not worth a single dime because the story sucks or the woman is man hating.
fun fact. the 2002 video game  buffy the vampire slayer  was voiced by all of the actors in the series except sarah michelle gellar. she felt that it was beneath her.
it wasnt just her show that was popular. at the time jessica alba had a popular show  jennifer garner  the alyssa milano witches  charmed  etc. there are countless other examples from that time period of female lead shows that featured them as  meta-human  at the very least
this is funny actually coming from buffy the vampire slayer. i know a lot of guys that enjoyed that show.
ya know its crazy  not only do i love buffy  tomb raider  and underworld  but all three of those were something my dad loved before i did. i m almost 30  my father is in his 50s  and obviously the kids these days have been more than adequately exposed to female action leads. so it really makes you question which generation they are trying to desperately spread this message too
apparently someone forgot how she got famous
she has to be angling for something with this. either the approval of a certain group of people  or for someone to give her a role or something. she knows better than many how well a female hero can be embraced when the story is well done.
i fully agree with your assessment.  strongly written characters  be it male or female    a well written story will always find any audience.  hollywood has become toxic  pushing their  woke  agenda onto the public.  but to blame the fans for the failure to deliver a suitable product can result in a severe loss of revenue.
people liked buffy because it was a good show. the audience for the show was a good mix between girls and guys. it s tone deaf for her to randomly come out and say something like this. smg is literally famous for being an action star.
yes. we wanted a black widow movie. but the movie wasn t good. they changed characters. and to little to late. when it came out  we didn t care. and some of these celebs are so whiny and narcissistic. hollywood for the most part does know how to make good movies anymore. top gun maverick was a big exception. you look amazing melonie. have a good day. and have fun on fnt.
it s a sad day. sarah michelle gellar was my celebrity crush back in the day. also  you re take on how men are daydreaming about beating up bad guys or saving people is 1000  accurate. i often think about what i would do if someone was in serious trouble  being attacked.
i want the female heroes but i want them to look like the character in the comics and be like the characters in the comics not intersectional feminist.
i m embarrassed for her. of all the people she should know better.
sarah just wants the internet talking about her again. it s been years since she s been able to see her name trending on social media. celebrities can only go so long without being the center of attention.
pre-disney  carol danvers fans  first time eh
i m genuinely interested in how sarah reached that conclusion... i mean  did she talk to someone or did she just read the first few articles on page one of the search results
to them  we are non-existant or we are misogynists for liking wonder woman.
i grew up idolizing storm  she-ra  and sailor mercury.  most men around age 30 grew up in an environment where there were plenty of strong females and female leads in fiction.  oh but i m a mysoginist because i don t like a two hour long liberal hollywood sponsored misandrist propaganda designed to make me feel like shit for being born a male  these people are idiots  gellar is just another on the long list of people i used to like but lost all respect for when the woke  culture war  bullshit started.i d hate my female idols too if their only purpose was to emasculate men and oversell women. the reason i loved storm  she-ra  and sailor moon was because they were strong because of their personalities  not because of their genitals.
guess people like smg are just gonna ignore the fact that the 2012 avengers film included black widow  and people loved that movie! not to mention  even the old fantastic 4 had its invisible woman fans. and for a non-marvel example  i guess she also missed the elastigirl simps. we could go on and on all day about how moronic that statement from smg is! celebs are out of touch.
@anedime  it goes even back before that time if you go back to the sixties and fifties woman s was goddesses some people is afraid that example birds who was the lead of that film it was definitely a woman okay in the movie the avengers the spy version yeah two leads a man and a woman all the recently sequel to 47 running she was a descendant to keanu reeves character from the first one and the other one was the granddaughter of the grandfather as well you see where i m going with this they double-team teamed up to defeat a powerful enemy
we must be.  they can t get over the fact that wonder woman was way better than captain marvel.
i anticipated black widow movie since avemgers quite honestly but they butchered the story for  the message  and it s a half a decade too late.
@normanreaddis  i didn t like it for butchering taskmaster
@artfire28 that s the greatest sin of the film like annet bennings as mar-vell in captain marvel.
she live long enough to become the villain.
sarah follows jennifer into the i forgot about u.
there has always been female superheroes and they did very well in the sale but you know nowadays everything is problematic and victimized
yeah  she totally missed the irony.  as the actress who played one of the most overpowered and popular girl bosses of all time - buffy the vampire slayer - she should have realized what she was saying about fans not liking action lead females was ridiculous.
then when people want to watch woman superheroes the left claims it s only because the actor is sexy and hot
@eadric3338  she is almost as bad as jennifer lawence saying she was the first female action star in a movie lol. wow some of these actresses must have their head in the sand.
i wouldn t call her a superhero  but buffy was a vampire hunter.
while it is true that i think wonder woman is hot af  i really admire her compassion  heroism and badassery and she s alot like me in a lot of ways tbh. that s why she s my third favorite superhero of all time
wwll truth be told. people only want the pretty ones. imagine a super hero female looking like shrek
female super heroes are popular but not when you destroy the male version to copy and paste then insult fans and write bad marry sue type stories with no journey or character growth   trash is just trash stop trying to spin it
why does this remind that wonder woman was written by a man who him and his wife were apparently super into bdsm and female dominance.
or she hulk before disney........look at how they massacred my girl.
to be fair  we like wonder woman because gal gadot is incredibly pretty. she s not even a good  not even an average actress. she s pretty weak  tbh.
we want well written heroes who don t come off as tumblr feminists who hate men.  or who aren t insanely overpowered such that the only challenge they face is their own inhibitions.
@cainabel6356  yet if we don t like the character  we are labeled sexist bigots  so there is no winning with these people. they will find any reason to make anything bigoted  forgetting nobody but them is making this about race  gender  or sexual orientation. they make their gender  race  and orientation part of the character s personality. which should not even be a factor. if your story is well-written with good character development and personality and undergoes a change in the character s nature through the story not rely on identity politics to drive the plot along. then most people would probably tune in. these people in hollywood now want to push identity politics  thinking this will get butts in seats and people to tune in to watch their project. only for the opposite effect to happen  people show up  watch their stuff  and be mad that it is terrible and shallow in its content  only for such showrunners  actors  and actresses to play the bigot card for the umpteenth time  attacking the consumer as bigots in some way  shape  or form.
@mstevens94  - yep  one reason why everytime they call me something  i just here blah  blah  blah. the only thing i say back to them is   your words have no meaning at all to me  you horrid creature.
@yt1300mf  overpowered heroes exist and are loved a lot.albeit with more complexity such as superman and well more of an anti hero kratos.
yes. yes  just about every wonder woman fan is an anathema to these cultists. they despise batgirl and supergirl even more. you don t believe me  compare to what all three character used to be. yes  there were several questionable things about wonder woman until the 60s. i m not going into that. then there s the nosedive they did in 1968  and it took gloria steinem to bring back the  sexist  wonder woman.take a moment to think that through. these  progressive  people back in the late 60s nerfed princess diana  got her focused as much on fashion as anything else  and made sure to toss away that  sexist and skimpy outfit.  it took gloria  founder of ms. magazine  to personally campaign to bring back the amazon princess as she was   skimpy outfit  and all. ms. steinem pointed out it s not the revealing and flattering outfit that was central to diana  but it was certainly a signature of her confidence. and there s barbara gordon and kara zor-el.  yes  people tend to think of them as  just sweet girls  back then and even until the 80s  but they missed the point. both young women were ultimately independent and stood their ground in a world were most thought  men ruled.  it wasn t the case  but i digress. even more  in the 90s  both barbara and linda kara  long story  were more serious  introspective  and thought-provoking. both suffered personal losses which would crush most people  but not only did the press on  their both rebuilt their lives.now  now all three are pretty much the antithesis of what they once were. barbara gordon has daddy-issues and spends more time  protesting  instead of organizing  coordinating  and guiding pretty much all of earth s superheroes. kara has been transmuted into an angry  hostile  uncompassionate soul who could barely bother to look on someone else s suffering. and let s not get started with wonder woman.i have to ask just what is happening to make so many people in hollywood and beyond swallow down the ever-growing cult dogma that everything from before was  bad   everything was  sexist  and pushed down everyone  and it all  has to be destroyed.   ms. geller  you got your millions and your cushy life off that  bad  time period. and how about anne hathaway who now claims every role she had she  suffered with sexism.  you know what  if those nutjobs what to surrender everything to the  activism  cult  fine. we ll still keep the copies of the movies and shows they were on because of the good lessons they had  and also as examples of what happens to people who had it good  but sold themselves into the lies. that and we ll wait until the cult burns everything the touch to the ground. we ll rebuild it all in time.
wonder woman was boring
@jeymez6891  they mean the character not only the movie
@chandllerburse737  i know what they meant  i just didn t get into wonder woman  and that would include the character. buffy i wouldn t really call her a superhero  it s more like she had certain abilities that helped her deal with vampires. but wonder woman is basically a female superman  out of the dc comics i never quite got into her.
@jeymez6891  supergirl is a female superman.
@jeymez6891  she had super human strength  fights great and heals faster than regular people. blade  is literally the same exact thing except he s half vampire
@weaponsofwarfare9537  so buffy wasn t just a normal girl  i haven t watched the series in years. i used to watch all the time when i was still in school  this was around 2001. but the last time i watched the series dates back to 06  work and other things took me away from any kinda tv for awhile  marriage one of them. but i do remember her having something that gave her strength  and the heal part is like wolverine. i remember blade  but i only liked the first one.
and kristy swanson was the first buffy   so she should be grateful she got that opportunity
@jeymez6891   first 2 are great   but trinity was
buffy was a superhero comedy horror series.
and the show did good cuz it wasnt a man hating show
i watch the it once a year i love it but not angel so much
this! the main character of buffy the vampire slayer  arguably one of the most popular supernatural action shows of its era  denies that men will watch female action shows movies ! the desperation for relevance is sounding very strong with this one.
perfect example of forgetting where you came from. and it s not like the reasons for hating these new movies and shows is a secret  everyone has been explaining that we don t like the social politics of it being shoved down our throats. it can be done without doing that but it isn t.
@spaceranger7683  i agree. this sounds more like an old boomer trying to seem cool to their grandkids by saying something cringey and  modern . that or she is just a hypocrite. both show her lack of character.
@batman0  this is what happens when an industry gets corrupt and all the passionate professionals are replaced by woke npcs who have 0 talent and can t  seem to create something that surpasses a bad tumblr fanfic...
all of those shows ended over 10 years ago. before the mcu even existed. so not great examples. the media landscape has changed.
@user-tu6qe5xn4t  yeah  they are suffering from amnesia and marginalize all women like you are doing right now. of course female leads have lost popularity in the last decade. but like you  woke people have never bothered to ask why. rather  they marginalize all women before them like jennifer lawrence did by pretending they never happened and female leads in action movies are a novum. the people who don t like brie larson etc. are the same people  like me  who have watched alien  tomb raider  charmed  xena etc. but instead of doing some self-reflection and wondering why they no longer like female action leads  they shame them and pretend they never liked female leads to begin with. it s always easier to blame others instead of working on your own shortcomings. you are right though  the movie landscape has changed. good directors  script writers and especially actors have become extremely rare nowadays  regardless of their gender or skin color.
current hollywood despises these shows  because they would rather have agenda driven garbage than entertainment...
perfectly put.
she s just toeing the party line so she can still get work.
i never liked the tv show  buffy the vampire slayer. the movie with kristy swanson and donald sutherland was a lot of fun  but i never could get myself to like sarah michelle gellar in the role.
@hiraghm  well  for me and most fans it is the other way round. the movie was terrible  sorry. nothing against kristy swanson  but just no. without the tv show  this movie would have been long forgotten never to be mentioned again.
bet she only says it like some other actors i know ewan macgregor secretly dont like woke either but he stays silent of how he really feels to still get roles in hollywood movies
same  so it just makes gellar s comments that much more hypocritical considering it was a predominately male fanbase that even made her famous in the first place.
well spoken !!!
sarah is probably bored  maybe she said that to get hollywood s attention. sarah doesn t strike me the type to sound like the lost sheep of this generation  but she hasn t acted in anything major in awhile.
ripley was always my favourite
well  smg hasn t seen a good script since buffy ended  so it makes sense that she s forgotten what one looks like.
yep. exactly how i feel.
i thought they were  karens .
@chrishayate  i m not sure i agree. i hear read anti-hero  i think rambo  dirty harry  wolverine  hollywood cancellers are nothing but a bunch of snowflakes.but the anti-male thing  spot on.
@brichan1851  i m talking about anti hetero  not anti hero. anti hetero meaning that romantic relationships and scenes between man and woman are not wanted right now.
@chrishayate  ah. missed it. thanks. very cool.
you dont have to smash one whole sex to be seen as strong. whatever happened to the writers who gave us sarah conner  ellen ripley and original og princess leia
hells yes. xena was fantastic. it was also woke before all else  as gabrielle was depicted as lesbian.
i like lucy lawless in evil dead the game i just love her voice.
just imagine if joss whedon came out and said   all women want is topless henry cavill and bottomless chris hemsworth! ugh! i m a guy who loves stephanie brown from dc comics. james gunn just announces his new dc slate. in all the years of movies we ve had  and what s coming up  still no word on the female superhero i ve been waiting to see adapted in live-action feature format since nolan s take on batman in 2005.
@user-ko4wx4iq4y  i liked they left it ambiguous.
xena was great!
@gjergjaurelius9798  i agree! in fact there were shows like will akd grace  and even star trek tng addresses these things. they were all able to express an opinion that didn t actually offend anyone.
@briangrant9942  she played a great cylon in battlestar galactica as well
@valyriansteel5446  i wish that show was still around it was a great show.
man  i loved xena whenever it came on. may or may not have had something to do with me having a massive crush on callisto  yes  i know she was unstable but still lol .
and what about xena during the 90s  i m wondering why they haven t rebooted that show yet.
hollywood likes to ignore them examples and pretend they never existed...in hollywoods mind only certain shows and movies existed...
dark angel was jessica alba s
@user-ko4wx4iq4y  actually it was ambiguous and  they hinted at her having feelings for xena but wouldn t indicate if romantic or just as a sister kind of thing. the gay community pushed the whole they are gay agenda on it. if you actually watch the series she falls in love with a couple men at different points  her husband being killed by calisto and her wanting revenge was actually a major part of her character arc.
@bradmiles1984  this! this is exactly what i was trying to suggest. the actual story logic reasons didn t really matter. the story itself was more important  but it was dealt with in subtlety.
exactly!
i watched for like 5 seasons.  i switched to dark angel with jessica alba when that came out
yup  i watched buffy and angel every week. those were some good times. and at no point did i think  i like x better because of their gender.  they were both  just awesome heroes.
if you go to any buffy convention or space it s filled with women and lgbt
yup. buffy is still one of my all-time favorites. not gonna let a bad take from smg ruin her show for me.buffy was all about subverting stereotypes  and the series worked because it approached storytelling with a sense of humor  as opposed to lecturing the audience about what awful people they are.
yep  when i was growing up i watched buffy  xena  relic hunter  had zero problems with a female lead.  yes part of it was sex appeal  but don t tell thor taking his shirt off every five seconds wasn t for sex appeal too.  the difference in the days of xena and buffy vs now  is they didn t constantly berate men  nor were they poorly written mary sues.
@yt1300mf  yeah the thor part is a good point. look at kevin sorbo in hercules  they literally made it a joke of women oogling him every time he had his shirt off. it was played off as lighthearted joke but we all know it was for the female fans.
if they can trick the new watchers into seeing things this way then thats what their goal is  also to forget the past movies and tv shows...
her name has popped up in my feeds multiple times lately so i m sure you are right. she s probably working with a publicist and looking for a role. that said i didn t expect this from her. she has always seemed level headed but unfortunately this is how actors get work these days.
@evilfantasy69  we ll really know she s looking for work if she comes out hard against whedon in the next few weeks. she s been rather quiet on him from what i ve seen so far.
@rstarbuck13  the whedon stuff has already started. that s what i first noticed a few weeks ago. talking about how she was the main shield between him and the other girls. a few days ago there was an article about how she and dolly parton have low-kew been best friends forever. dolly parton is the queen of drag queens so that article was surely part of the publicity strategy.
this isn t anything new tbh. she and her husband probably got connections to disney.if you ever notice the timing of articles  those two always pop up whenever star wars or marvel or disney gets bad pr. so either freddie prinze jr gets into some dumb crap  another whedon scandal or buffy article drops in the press  probably from gellar or their friends  or gellar does something and gets fawning from the press.it s happened so many times over the years that it smells like deflection. i m kinda convinced that she s coming out more often because her husband is net-negative pr these days.
@littlebee7147  i think this is just a normal press run. i just found her new series on paramount  . looks very generic and has all of the current hollywood  inclusive  cast members. maybe trying to recreate the buffy phenomenon. trailer for  wolf pack  https   youtu.be 7vwyymed3j8
she s obviously trying to gain attention to make herself relevant again. wome just can t age with pride and honor.
he man woke reboot didnt do as hot as kevin  im an asshole  smith proclaims it did  of course shes fishing for a new role.
yeah i watched it i like wow taskmaster is really good but then i was like what the hell is going on what the hell is the a  hole from the first ant-man movie doing here and then i was like oh no they didn t you race swap into a woman task master and oh yeah i love top gun 2 but i m banking on elvis at the oscars
i wanted a widow movie for a long time.  it was the first movie i went to see after covid.  i m not sorry i went to see it  but it was weak.
the problem is the widow movie came out after when she s already dead in the current timeline so most didn t care about a prequel movie. they should of made it like after civil war. also they did taskmaster dirty in the movie changing the character just to add another female in.
they should ve made it 2 or 3 years after the winter soldier.
facts
i personally don t care who the hero is  marvel just needs to write the plot well and not push an agenda on everyone. great video melonie! i also loved that short video you made earlier! it was very funny and i m proud that you re doing what it takes to protect yourself! keep at it!  3
anyone from hollywood  all male superheroes and jessica jones have to do is make their main characters unique  relatable and likable and people just can t get enough of them.  how is that fair for female heroes
no-one  ... famous person  people only want male superheroes literally everyone  no  we want well written superheroes also  side note  i m pretty sure buffy was much better received than angel...
i think cynthia rothrock is too often left out of the conversation when it comes to female led action movies. she s a pioneer and a badass irl. most people can t tear the ligament in their leg  never have it repaired but have such strong leg muscles that her leg still functions fine.
dollhouse is one of my favorite series of all time.  another female led action show.
i think the heavy fan criticism comes from the trend of hollywood to constantly make heroines superior or political  instead of making them relatable. strong and interesting women are sprinkled throughout human history  hollywood just needs to utilize these characters and lose the posturing  and focus on the unique traits of these amazing and unique forebearers.
i could be outdated but i was just telling my girl about how strong females are lacking in this era. i was showing her alita  battle angel trailer and was giving her the gist of her struggles and how she overcame them. i m not sure if she was the most recent strong female character in movies but alita was the first person that cane to mind when i saw the title
xena warrior princess was one of my favourites growing up. we do like female led shows but they don t make them like they used too.
what a weird take  my favorite franchise characters are female. selene from underworld  babydoll from sucker punch  and so on....
i was a huge buffy fan growing up and loved most of what gellar has done since then. it sucks to see her distorted view on what s going on. you re definitely right  about what s really going on! i was so pumped when she-hulk was originally announced as i m a big fan of the hulk universe. but it was trash! disney needs to just give marvel back their movies!
so many great female x-men characters out there. all original and not copies of male characters. and people absolutely love them. do them right and they will be successful movies.
clears throat  takes deep breathbuffy summers  xena  wonder woman  storm  rouge  invisible woman  witchblade  she hulk  batgirl  elektra  queen   country  red sonja  lady death  scarlet witch  wasp  black widow  jean grey  morgan fairchild  raven  starfire  vixen. all female. all superheroes or the equivalent in their respective universes. and this isn t even going into manga and video games where i could list lara croft  samus aran  the sailor scouts  female soul reapers  any kunoichi from one of the hidden villages  or pirates and marines from one piece
i still read a ton of science fiction but haven t read comics in quite a while. i have to admit  i ve basically stopped searching for new female sci-fi writers. when looking at new material i now tend to screen out anything written by women. why  the messaging is too in your face  and the story too lacking most of the time. i m currently reading a story about a  strong female character   which is written by a man. i don t have a problem with that  because i enjoy the story. i still go back and read many of the classic female sci-fi writers of the past  norton  mccaffery  cherryh  leguin  etc... but i m happily missing out on this generation. and i m also okay with that.
this is making me love male superheroes
even if audience only wanted male superheroes  then it s up to the studios to figure out what their audience wants and then give them what they want. that s how business works  or at least should work.however  we know this is not true. and as you said  people just want a good movie  regardless of the gender or identity.
guys love a female lead show if they are good. i loved buffy.  if they had a she hulk that was like buffy  it would have be loved.
it is true  many people want male superheroes  because recruited  male teenagers dominate the fandom.  for female superheroes  such as wonder woman and black widow  people want to believe in the women  it means they have real superhero aspects  and they can bring the fight to the enemy.  all superheroes are enemy worship  it is all about conflict  and this means you have to be strong enough to survive.  no two superheroes are the same  and it is really the variety of the stories that keep people entertained.
meanwhile some of the most popular fanfiction  for better or worse in writing  and with authors of both genders  tends to center around either female characters directly  or how their interactions  read  influence  with the male main character of the base series alters the timeline. what people are annoyed with  as always  is the anvilicious social politics bs that is infesting newer official entries  where rather than showing a strong female character  they instead have to tell you they are strong  while at the same time having to actively degrade the male characters to make it function.
with my comics i decide to make both a guy and girl  because  i felt like they would both have great stories. i mean these companies  should pay attention  to the little guys and learn from us.
i enjoy how you always say what most of us are thinking and enjoy your content. keep up the great videos and content!!
thank you so much!
respect the source material  no benders.
@normanreaddis  exactly  there are so many good female super heroes and villains out there where if they stuck to the source it would be a good movie.
@bradmiles1984 this industry is so lazy by riding on the coattails of the establish ones and always relies on shock value and subversion of expectations the negative way. and they love deconstructing something like they re competing in the next iron chef episode.
@normanreaddis  yeah the sad thing is they want to upend everything instead of just adapting material that is already proven to work. i don t get the logic  it s like they want to lose money.
@bradmiles1984 they maybe losing money but overton window is a long term investment and they re learning. people are now tolerating the agenda as long as the product is  good . theuy can now hide it in plain sight and people will support it. just like the success of mcu phase 4 titles  most of that sales cames from people that just adapted the mcu trend and no knowledge of the crap of the industry. never underestimate the power of mediocrity.
it s been a while  but i recall buffy at least had a proper series ending  whereas angel ended on a cliffhanger.
i thought angel was better.
it was much better received than angel.
i didn t know that happened to rothrock.
@starsiegeplayer   i just found out last year. she was on scott adkins  yt show  art of action.
glad you brought her up  she s a legend
super underrated  i watched it long after it was canceled just coz i loved buffy  angel and serenity series  so  looking for more joss whedon series i find there was one where the protagonist was faith!! the character that i liked most on buffy   so i needed to watch and it  and it was pretty great.
i thought dollhouse was great and granted i was only a kid at the time  i dare even say james cameron s jessica alba in dark angel was also thoroughly entertaining at the time. gellar sounds salty af
i m rewatching that now. it s a shame it got cancelled
don t forget tru calling...
it was definitely underrated  though  the last season kinda went off the rails with the post apocalyptic story line. eliza dushku is a good actress. right before the pandemic crashed everything  there was an article about an adaptation of the black company books. she was supposed to play the lady. i would love to have seen that.
@boxcatkeys  someone can t deal with hitting  the wall.  personally  i think that s a hollywood created standard  but it s a reality. she needs to bash producers and writers  not fans.
disney sort of owns marvel though....i have been a she-hulk fan since the 1980s. never liked hulk though ......  weird huh     i had hope for the show. it failed.
didn t battle angel atila just recently do well as did the first wonder woman movie  even captain marvel did well financially so this is just a pr stunt.
i m a huge norton fan starting when i was a teenager  quite some time ago . i ve also enjoyed leguin and crispin. lately i ve read some newer stuff by anthea sharp  susan kaye quinn  and kristine kathryn rusch that i liked well enough. they re perfectly willing to write both male and female leads  though. i haven t noticed a feminist agenda from those authors  though i haven t read everything they ve written . i m sure there are some other female writers i ve enjoyed recently that i m just not thinking of right now. i have noticed the agenda at times in other works  though  and it didn t add to the enjoyment of the story.
super heros are for little kids and wokies
she was basically a superhero before a lot of these movies even started.
maybe we do.  give the people what they want   amazingly  studios will make money again
people love superheroines when they re well written. hell there was an entire show about three sister kicking ass called charmed that people liked enough for it to have like 10 seasons. it s not the sex of the hero people don t like  it s the terrible writing and preaching that comes with them that they don t likeshe-hulk is an amazing character in the comics  and definitely has her own thing going on.
i m writing and producing a sci fi sitcom in its third season  and i love having some very compelling women in the cast. what has been a great deal of fun is exploring every cast member as somewhat flawed  and in need of improvement and seeing how they manage that over time  and where they have setbacks. i ve always started my characters out at their most extreme and then slowly walked them back to reveal their more day-to-day existence and see what of those extreme elements still plays into them. but that isn t a gender-based thing  that s a character-based thing. when you have literally a non-existent budget you have one thing going for you  and that s your skill at developing  along with the actors  the characters. i m not sure that beyond the original marvel phase one - three that this was a consideration. disney may have opted to substitute fx for character  which certainly seemed to be the case with capt. marvel. movies are like songs  and they need to have a hook  and a voice. that means a compelling story and a compelling character. without either of these you can have the most dazzling fx and it will mean nothing.
paige guthry - huskillyana rasputina - magiktwo characters off the top of my head that i could have seen gellar playing in the mcu shortly after her buffy run. she s a little old for those specific roles  but i could still see her in an mcu role.the issue is  so many of the best female marvel characters were introduced in team comics and work extremely well in the team dynamic. too many female characters don t work solo because they re just copies of the pre-existing male characters or people expect to see them interacting with the team they re known for.black widow didn t work because they waited far too long to give her a film. she should have had a solo film immediately after civil war and closer in tone to winter soldier. also because they ruined taskmaster. having the real taskmaster in the role would have been a fantastic enemy for natasha to be up against. they could have gone with him signing the accords to get back on the government s good graces and going after natasha after civil war.
they focus way to much on them being better than men that they end up being worse than them
she s gunning for amberh. s roles  since she s out
well said melonie. i don t go into a movie thinking i only want to watch other men on the screen. i just want a decent story  with decent acting and if possible original characters. it s funny  i used to like buffy as a teenager and watched it primarily for gellar. but hey i m glad to know what she really thinks about us men. makes it easy to ignore her new content.
just a little thought guys  she is trying to stir up a little controversy around her name just as her new show wolfpack is about to come out. also  she s appearing in a lot of interviews lately. it could be a promotional thing  by the way  i too loved buffy back in the day  so i do see the irony of her saying that... .
some of my favorite movies have female leads  aliens  halloween  1978   kill bill vol. 1   2  hellraiser  a nightmare on elm street  1984    the craft  the silence of the lambs  kiki s delivery service  the secret of nimh  legally blonde  the haunting  1963   la femme nikita  labyrinth  carrie  1976   whatever happened to baby jane   the wizard of oz. i think you get the point.
well. if it s that what it takes to bring back good entertainment i m all for it.
your summary was spot on. as a member of the audience  don t shame me for not wanting to watch crappy content.
two words  wonder woman.
i liked seeing your cat  i got one too  nice cat cameo.anyway yeah  i ve never avoided a superhero movie just because it had a female superhero.  i remember when that carol danvers movie came out  i don t like calling her captain marvel  to me that s someone else   i was definitely turned off  and then that one ghostbusters movie before that.  as a creator of stories myself it s good to be reminded that i should never demand anything from the audience  or blame any missteps on them  personal responsibility in any situation is important.i want to create a female superhero now  even though i already have countless others  you never know where you ll find inspiration from!!!
i can t believe sarah michelle gellar would say something like that and i had a huge crush on her back in the days
i actually love carol danvers  the og ms. marvel before the dark times... before the mouse...  super hero wise  shes my fav.  comic characters however  shes tied for my favorite  along with frank castle  dan ketch  eddie brock  and blade.
jessica alba was also a badass in dark angel that came out in 2000
she s trying to get a marvel role.
keep up the awesome work  melonie!
10 seasons  4 spin-offs and a reboot.......
@nobodyshome6792  the reboot sucks.
buffy was way more than just horror. it was everything.
i loved buffy when i was a kid. electra  lara croft  hell i was watching sailor moon cartoon i didn t know at that time what anime is  when i was a kid and would still watch it right now just to see usagi plus rest of sailors in action and first iconic opening witch i adore  so they can stop their bs.
buffy is one of the shows i use as an example of female protagonists hero that we all loved. i laughed so hard when i saw this because it s such a self own.
it s amazing how people will do anything to justify their own prejudice  what sarah is trying to say here is she will reject any female characters who don t insult and humiliate men.
buffy was one of the biggest franchises of the  90 s!
if the story is compellingly written  i d bet a movie staring a plastic 80 s lunch box would do well. it s amazing what can be done with a good story. it s a shame that it  is  amazing because there have been so damn few of them the last several years.
i ve written and published two female-led superhero novels. while i m nowhere near a bestseller or anything  i ve yet to meet anyone who was put off by the gender of the leads. i ve sold copies to men and women  as well as teen boys and teen girls.
not true we just dont want to be talked down too by the female super hero about how hard their life is when they can fly
its not about them being male or female its about them being actual heroes or even anti-heroes and good characters in a good story and not too arrogant and self righteous and also not telling the viewer what they want and letting them decide for themselves and like what they like. the problem seems to come when the viewer is supposed to like absolutely every character which is not realistic some characters will be more popular than others and the viewer should not be made to feel bad when they do not immediately love a character  that can say more about the creators than the viewer.
perhaps it s not the gender of a  superhero  that we should be discussing. perhaps it s the idea of how we define just what exactly a hero is these days. one of my favorite movies growing up was brandon lee s the crow  a dark  gritty  techno-gothic infused action   thriller film about a guy who comes back from the dead to avenge the death of his girlfriend and himself. along the way he doesn t just dispense revenge  justice and the odd ass kicking  he reminds a street kid that she is cared for  tells a failing junkie mother that she has responsibilities...  mother is the name for god on the lips and hearts of all children. your daughter is out there on the streets waiting for you.  he also rocks out with a guitar solo and the soundtrack is pretty awesome. but aside from the aforementioned ass kickings aided by super human strength i would say his superpower is his humanity. something which all the villains in the film clearly lack. a few other  superheroes  i grew up watching  macgyver  a guy who doesn t rely on guns or violence but whose best weapon is his mind and his ability to get out of tricky situations and his intelligence. do they write protagonists like this nowadays  not many that s for sure. columbo is another show i love  i d argue he s a hero  a mild mannered  trench coat wearing  cigar chomping cop who always gets the bad guy. sure he looks like a disorderly  clueless  bumbling bozo  like the guy that peter sellers plays in pink panther  but his genius lies beneath. finally  i d just like to say that after watching fnt with melonie mac on it  it s great to have her videos recommended on yt. i subscribed right away and look  forward to more of her stuff. in conclusion... boom!  mic drop .
this makes me a bit sad because buffy is one of the best series ever and i ve always liked sarah. she seems like a good mom with a long term family relationship. she just hasn t given this subject enough thought.
i remember everyone gathering around the tv to watch buffy you didnt want to be the only one at school who didnt watch it.the reason everything is bad right now is because in order to have a likeable protagonist they need to have at least one conservative value but those are reserved for villains which why we like them so much.
one of my top favorite marvel characters is misty knight when she led the heroes for hire villains for hire. if they did that on the big screen  everyone would love it.
ironic considering her career was made on being a female superhero  a vampire slayer
as someone who was a big buffy when it was out  even rewatched it like 2 years ago  that s really disappointing to hear from her like she was literally the lead in a show where she was basically a superhero a show that was so popular that it had a spin off  angel  and even that was popular like how often does that happen  a very dumb take from sarah tbh
happy friday melonie mac! have a great weekend!
in short  check ya privilege buffy.
1 thing most people never mention is the marketing before release and sometimes even during the tv shows life. rings of power  cpt marvel  etc. they actively marketed everything around feminism and identity politics. when you do that  people are already turned away. it shows exactly where their pride in their  art  is. it s not in the source material  it s not in the quality  and it s not in the talent of the people who worked on it. it s in their moral superiority.
the way i see it is that if your a superhero and your strong enough to save world   and fight evil then you should be strong enough to show at least a modicum of respect and consideration for others. even batman one of the most aggressive superheros  does that to some degree.
coming from someone who was  herself  a popular female superhero  this proves she s a natural blonde.
agree 100  she missed the mark on this one.
she was great in the luke cage netflix show.
@iraford5788  i never finished the first season  but what i saw was cool. i just wanted her to get that arm and be a badass and they took too long lol.
lol does that to a degree.it seems like a progressive development of his character throughout his history to do so.but this reminds me of how in the animated series he ends up mostly alone with no one left to respect him because of his obsession with war on crime.
i think for the most part she s right though. you have your handful of female heroes  buffy  xena  wonder woman  maybe jean grey are there others  at least in comic books  they just don t sell well or at least compared to their male counterparts. not sure if it s the writing  the art  or the acting  if live action
is that why buffy was so popular at the time
melonie is our superhero!
she clearly doesn t understand why anyone knows her. she played a female superhero that is almost unanimously loved. it was all due to her portrayal and the writing that supported the character. these new  modern female heroes are rejected because they are always the bestest ever not because they are great but because the writers lessen every other character to make them appear that way. if you want female heroes accepted then you need to write them in a way shows the greatness they can achieve without diminishing their peers. it s called good writing and good performance.
did she forget she had been playing a role of a super heroine in the very popular tv show  if she has amnesia she should go visit a doctor
so much so she had to endure playing one for seven seasons on broadcast television. she s so right. that buffy. what a flash in the pan....wait
yellowflash had the same take as you  sounds likes she s bitter that she chose to be a wife and mother over her career.
hey melonie. im interested in seeing what this is all about.
wow!! excellent content.  one of the minuscule times the algorithm actually recommended a channel that is actually interesting.  thank you for the content.
i m curious mel are you going to do a reaction to the new show she is in  it s called wolfpack. i was happy to see her back on tv   all but never realized she was like this at all  buffy fan here so lol
i just happened to stumble upon your youtube channel because i like the same stuff you do. i have 8 laura croft action figures. collectables by mcfarlane toys. i played all the games. getting laura s butler from tomb raider 2 stuck in the pantry was hilarious. i m a new subscriber to your channel.
i know it might be random but i adore your cat. such a beautiful kitty. remind me of my old cat. i m a cat dad myself and it s a sweet thing seeing people moving animals   much love
buffy was a fantastic show that i ve loved for years.  what made it great was the writing and character development.  telling a good story was primary.   today s shows lead with a preachy agenda and storytelling is barely a consideration
women can be interesting characters if actually done right. i don t like women done in the feminist way though where they basically hate men but act worse then men or like a mary sue than can do anything without character development.
of course this happens the day after i start getting into the show
you want a new character  she-man  it s perfect for modern audiences.
sarah michelle gellar is a great actress n loved her role as dhapne blake n buffy
i remember that the first dcu wonder woman movie was pretty much universally liked.
imagine if hollywood stopped making excuses for and started learning from their failures...
i watched one of your fire emblem engage playthrough videos for the first time yesterday  although it s not my kind of game i had fun watching you enjoy what you like to play. and i didn t know you are from texas too! hope you have a wonderful day and god bless you fellow texan.
the math ain t math n !!  hilariously accurate my sis! keep up the excellent work!!
she spent too much time in the wokieverse.......forgetting those of us men who grew up watching buffy in high school.
yeah  just because buffy was a good show doesn t mean smg has good takes or is anything like the character she played. her character is actually quite strange if you look closely. she s like a grizzled veteran when the show opens  because she had already been acting as the slayer when audiences are introduced to her  yet she turns love stricken when it comes to angel  who i don t think does much to win her affection. it just kind of happens. and ask a lot of buffy fans  her character is not usually a favorite. not disliked  just not overly loved. the show was more about the group fighting together no matter how many times they recited i m the slayer line. so  yeah  i think she is definitely on the woke train  but thought she liked to play it more eve keel when it came to her takes.
buffy was a superhero. i loved watching buffy   also xena warrior princess!
i loved  jessica jones   badass who did heroic deeds but did not want to be a hero.
nah she s just begging for a job   that s a   notice me senpai  moment
well  at least the actress who originally played buffy  kristy swanson  has some common sense.
she s fishing for relevance work for sure. not only did she star as one of tv s most successful female action protagonists ever but at the time said characters were hitting a pretty good stride.i doubt that she s this out of touch. i m sure that there s an end goal here.
it never ends.
i would have loved to see smg as black widow. and also  arcane ticks damn near every box and was f qing awesome. i thought vi was great.
translation   i need a job  so maybe if i say something controversial  they ll remember i exist.
i can t believe they got daphne
buffy was very popular with a high profile back in the day  i never watched it  not my bag  man  but im gen x and can remember the 90s   00s rather well. in fact i also recall the wonder woman telly show way back in the late 70s being quite popular too.
i love how you point out how feminists helped to kick gina carano off of mandalorian. they have no idea what they want or why people don t like them.
sarah... really!! you know i hoped. buffy the vampire slayers female stars would not go down tgis path.but as someone who enjoyed buffy as much as i did angel growing up.i am really let down by her.also. new subscriber to.
buffy was a long time ago. it finished in 2003. not even the same generation of media.but there has been some stuff its rare but wonder wan  black widow and even the ghost in the shell live action were actually pretty good.
buffy was such a great show because it was written so well. buffy was not a replacement character either unlike a lot of the modern female marvel characters. she was her own thing.
all that fame over buffy the vampire slayer really got to her head.
i may be showing my age here but i enjoyed the shows charmed  sebrina the teenage witch  90s comedy sitcom version . they had multiple female lead roles in a positive image. it isn t rocket science. good writing and likable characters make or break it.
thank you so much  i really appreciate it
@meloniemacgoboom  anytime! happy to be a supporter for you!
probably got a new pr person who got her to make a fuss about this so that producers will remember she exists.
she is starring in a brand new show on paramount plus...she was just on jimmy fallon the other night promoting it
@hamanu666  she s in a new tv show lol wolfpack
@joshcramer3578 so publicity for a new show then!
well  they already got to velma  so i guess she was just next in line. lol
@spaceranger7683  sad but true
that s funny considering i m a guy who has the entire buffyverse on dvd and has watched buffy and angel multiple times through.
does she not remember that she was freaking buffy the vampire slayer a show that had more than 6 seasons
they should ask lucy lawless about it   that spearheaded the tv 90s female action star ... of see how lindsay wagner the star of bionic woman in the 70s reacted ... or lynda carter the original wonder woman ... or see diana rigg acting roles in the 60s   the main lead in avengers ...
so i am the odd one out for being a fan of supergirl and wonder woman  no i want a well written story and superhero sarah
sarah michelle geller may have been in a successful  female hero  series  but she s no jennifer lawrence  who started it all!thanks for he  common sense   melonie!
when i was a like 13-15 year old boy  i loved buffy the vampire slayer. it s one of my favorite shows ever. so what is she even talking about here  these people.
black widow was amazing. and ww84 just needed better editing.
funny how she is erasing her most famous roll from media history
we don t only want male superheroes they just seems to get the worst writers who write them all the same
yeah people want well written female heroes  not gender swapped new heroes. i believe storm and rogue would be huge hits as origin stories  if they don t make them hate men.
she was great in cruel intentions
let s just hope eliza dushku and summer glau won t go woke or my 90 s are ruined
they  audiences  want good characters who battle to overcome inner and outer obstacles and change learn along the way. they don t want perfect  arrogant  mary-sue arseholes who belittle and immasculate the other characters to build themselves up.
people don t like female led action shows  says the star of one of the most famous female led action show ever.
capt marvel wasnt the first bad mcu movie but was the first time we felt them forcing us to comply
this is why actors need to stay out of the press unless there looked after  there good at acting. there are exceptions but a lot seem not to even know film tc history  even there own  when a film dose well the actors get the glory and when it fails the audience gets the blame. when a film is good people dont talk about the sex of the leads  today when a film is bad the cast do.
there goes another one to the  used to like  list.
she s nuts. i m still hoping for and waiting for an x-23 movie! same for supergirl and spider-gwen. also  i loved the first wonder woman movie. sorry  sarah. like most activists  you re dead wrong.black widow could ve been a good movie if the teaser  mid-credits  would have shown a way for her to come back. same exact movie  add that teaser  and you actually have a solid film.
i liked captain marvel well enough  i ve always said all the wokness i saw could be solely attributed to brie larson  and i thought gal gadot did a damn good job as wonder woman.
people only want male heroes. right  that s why people only watched biff the vampire slayer.
i thought she was good in the grudge as well  even if the movie wasn t great. it looked like she had a real career in movies ahead of her  don t know what happened.
gotta dislike everyone who has a different opinion  nice echo chamber
@joshcramer3578  you just described hollywood. well done.
@surlyunicorn9461  i described op as well
@joshcramer3578  not because of that.  she broke industry rule  1.  don t shit on other ip s.
i don t care the gender of the lead in a superhero movie. i do care about well-written lead and movie.
she needs to watch fate stay night  unlimited blade works or black lagoon and come back
i love buffy but smg has always been ... disapointing.
how s that coolaid  michelle  what on earth happens to these people when they get older
i think you re funny... most of the time.  pshoeonhead is hillarious - i like her recent take on  men s cave .i know  she edit the hell off her material and don t do daily content  but i like her leftie takes  she s more of at center nowadays... .
keep up the good work
imagine how hammered you would be if you had to drink every time tomb raider was mentioned!   p
good grief. sarah michelle gellar was so awesome wat happened to her this is so sad dudes
if they can make a female hero that s not a mary sue or simply an ahole  that would be great.
jessica jones  wandavision  wonder woman  the suicide squad  all had incredibly successful reception. wakanda forever  literally the most recent marvel movie  is female lead and one of the highest-rated. there are plenty of female characters from the marvel roster  especially in xmen that people would love to see star in their own movie. because there are so many original characters we want to see  not just ripoffs of the ones we ve already known for over a decade.powerpuff girls were pretty dope too.
i liked 3 mcu movies  iron man  guardians of the galaxy  and guardians of the galaxy ii.other than that  i liked toby mcguire s spiderman  none of the subsequent ones  bring back mj .i m also probably one of the very few people who preferred the original hulk   bruce banner  eric bana.of course  to me the hulk will always be dr david banner portrayed by bill bixby lou ferrigno.
idk i kinda want a mail delivery person as a hero. maybe named postal
there s a lot to unpack  tbh. first  female protagonists  if written well  have always been popular. that much is obvious if you do your research. second  market share is affected by rising and falling interests... but it is a hard fact that women do consume and spend money on entertainment. guess what many of them prefer  o.o i think a lot of these snapshot type comments don t take into account female fans  like myself  who want to thirst hard for loki or thor or whatever. while there are many female protagonists that i have enjoyed  scully  buffy  black widow  captain janeway  ciri yennefer   i do prefer male protagonists because on occasion i do enjoy eye candy. o.o sue me.
hey melonie have a great weekend  loved the playstation hoodie btw
..they re good.. what a concept!   margot robbie s harley hard carried suicide squad..i like smg s early work  but right now she be clownin
it s like people have a compulsive need to moan about things and when there s nothing to moan about they just make shit up to pander to certain audiences
as stated with rey palpatine. we dont hate female protagonists. we hate that youre too scared to give them the slightest bit of nuance  personality or struggle.
if her claim were accurate  she would be working the pole
if she weren t so delusional  she would recognize that the sexism is not on the part of the audience but that of the creative staff who give women the least of their efforts.
the male hero movies in the mcu have been heavily criticized too. iron man 3 thor 2 3 and 4  incredible hulk doctor strange 2 shang chi  sarah clearly doesn t know what she s talking about.
i m a proud misogynist! long live the patriarchy!
angel was 5 seasons with its male lead and buffy was 7 with its female lead  which destroys that theory. story is all that counts.
smg is married to the super-woke freddy prinze jr and voiced teela in that horrendously  anti-male he man netflix adaptation. she also worked with joss whedon for many years. so is it really any surprise to anyone that she s woke  i find it more surprising how she s only in her early 40s and looks like she s in her late 50s  seriously  she looks like she s 58 and has looked this way for years now. i guess wokeness and being bitter will age you like that.
my husband was obsessed with elektra when he was a kid.
the comic book people at marvel will probably say that they have tried to create original characters like snowflake  safespace and trailblazer and people didn t want them--because the world just isn t ready yet. the people currently at marvel comics don t have a creative bone in their body.
the  slayer of vampires  is actually the  queen of vampires . sad to see it.
well i have to say i enjoyed the buffie vampire slayer series back in the 1990s   it was then the female version of a super hero and it was entertaining . and then we had charmed which was quite different which wasnt anything close to super hero but   good  witches with supernatural powers which was equivalent and male and female   audiences liked both shows.  but going onto marvel movies what does gellar mean   brie larsons portrayal of captain marvel wasnt bad actually
just watching so i can hear what melanie s opinion is  and at 6 35 kitty   so @melaniemac may i ask what your cat s name is   may we please see more kitty cameos please
she was buffy for years. it was highly successful. is she insane
having lived in hollywood for many years  i can say that smg didn t have burnout. she stopped getting offers because she was a brie larson prototype. people refused to work with her. she s had this attitude since buffy.
immature people tend to blame other people for their problems... that s literally what everything could be boiled down to... most of these people have the mentality of a literal child...
just look at the two wonder woman movies   one was good and made money and the other not so much   a good story goes along way .
i wish i hadn t seen this i used to love buffy and surprised s.m.g. would speak out like this!
i only want  heroes   the problem lies in the current generation of writers not understanding what that means.
buffy was a real good strong and well write female character not like the cringe and woke shit of to day
we just want good heroes. like buffy summers  lara croft  dutch from killjoys...
ok  with this take  she clearly can t classify buffy  which is still getting rewatches to this day  as a superhero then what is buffy
a very big problem is that they don t even know who their audience is supposed to be. if they wanted to make feminist movies that would appeal to women you d think they would have the same ammount of succes with women that they had with their male audience in the past
it just occurred to me that sarah michelle gellar has the same initials as submachine gun.
unworthy thor has the most powerful ladythor in it  the story is insane she even fought bloodstorm thor to a standstill
it s extra funny considering smg was apparently only successful as a female   superhero ... well that and hot step sister  in cruel intentions.  i wish i could say it like michael corleone in the god father.  don t lie to me  because that insults my intelligence  and makes me very angry.
yes. make original characters. that s what they need to get thru their heads.
i feel like someone has told her this and she s just believed it without any further thought...but that s just a theory  a ghey theory...also  i m sure gary  nerdrotic  and mauler would have something to say about this
i liked her in buffy the vampire slayer
i hope to see you on fnt later!
i never considered her as buffy the vampire slayer.  kristy swanson will always be the only buffy the vampire slayer.
wandavision was great
they still haven t figured out that you don t have to put the male characters down  to bring the female characters up. even women hate to see their male heroes pushed into the back seat.
oh you have a cat ! that s nice. she looks a bit like my 2nd cat. she got cancer. died 17 years old. my first cat died with 20. since 2021 i have a new one. a few months later a second one. they decided to make 4 more. they came 31.03.2022. 1 has eyes like gollum  1 does somersaults all the time. another one always plays with her tail and sleeps in sinks  the last one has a black dot on her nose  always looks a bit mischievous. and sleepy. as if she just woke up. and they are a force of pure destrucion. especially the one hunting her tail causes a lot of chaos greetings from germany!
buffy says people don t want to see strong female characters. buffy. buffy.
excuse me  but sarah michelle gellar did not pave the way for superhero women...credit for that  best i can reckon  would be vivien leigh  who portrayed the superhero woman  scarlett o hara  in the 1939 classic   gone with the wind .before her  i think there was barbara stanwyck  who portrayed  stella dallas   and after there was greer garson as  mrs miniver . yet another superhero woman from the 50s would be katherine hepburn s portrayal of rose  rosie  sayer  in  the african queen . and if you don t think she was a superhero... you just don t know what  hero  means .i m being semi-facetious here  but these are just a few examples of where a superhero woman would differ from a superhero man.a scene from one of my favorite movies   conspiracy theory  has mel gibson urging julia roberts to hit the gas  dodge around  trying to lose a tail. roberts calmly informs him   that s what a man would do  and i m not a man ... then pulls into the next lane  waves the tail to come up alongside  and cheerfully discusses with the gov t agent following her what the hell he thought he was doing.that... is badass.the problem isn t that people don t want to see female superheroes. it s that what makes a woman a superhero is different from what makes a man a superhero  and hollyweird keeps trying to portray them as male superheroes.
people just want good super hero movies.
i must commend you for keeping your focus when your cat jumped on your lap.
wow  she saw the backlash from jenifer saying the stuff about female superh roes and said  hey  i wanna do the same  hahahaha  kudos
i think at marvel the original good female character they have come up with since claremont worked on the x-men are fewer than the original good female characters claremont came up with.
sarah has never watched anime  and it shows.
so her business model for hollywood is to produce movies the customer dosen t want  how s that been going for the last 5 years
melonie  if you were the super hero in a marvel movie  i d go see your moving in the theater and i never go to theaters anymore.
that s always their excuse!
karen fukuhara s  the female  is one of the best super hero characters in modern television. the mcu just isn t based enough to pull off good superheros these days.
also  anna kendrick would have been the perfect carol danvers.
1  the show movie must have a good story and or writing.2  the show movie must not insult or disparage any of the audience. 3  the show movie must not pander to anyone for  approval  where some might have disapproved. or in short  you can t please everyone  don t try.all 3 of these rules have been not only broken  but  shattered  picked up  and then burned   by recent hollywood shows movies.
i made an amazing female protagonist  who is yet unknown.  she s out deh tho!
female role leads or male leads do good with the right actors and writers. terminator 2 is the best terminator movie and sarah conor s character and actress is praised by fans. sarah michelle needs to remember her big break in buffy love that series. but a lot of movies in general have horrible stories and stuff catered to focus on topics instead of making a good movie. hollywood needs to rethink things
no  i love woman superheroes with big personalities too
when these people come out of the woodwork to accuse us of woman hating  i instantly lose all respect for them. buffy just dropped way  way down on my list of favorite shows.
ummmm wasn t the first wonder woman movie largely successful and well-liked by all  it s not the gender of the superheroes  but the writing wokeism that is the issue sometimes e.g. captain marvel. using unpopular female characters like ms. marvel and america chavez doesn t help either.
she s still bitter that jennifer lawrence was cast as buffy instead of her.
susan ivanova would like a word with these people. - while she wasn t a  lead  she was definitely a big linchpin in babylon 5 s story.
this proves one thing. regardless of how great they were in the past  give it enough time  wait till they reach a certain age and they will sooner or later turn woke. happened to michelle yeoh and whoopi goldberg too.
if they want to make a female lead movie with a good plot how about having a male write the action scene the plot to the fight and have a female write a emotional scene there that might be good and no one is in charge cause
people are losing touch with reality
god bless you speaking truth in your own unique way
iron man set the bar so high. lol i haven t watched a marvel movie since endgame
isn t buffy a female super hero with super strength etc  with a series that was so successful it could have gone on forever if she didn t want to quit acting in it
do actresses watch any movies other than their own   we have been hearing this mantra a lot lately.
sarah michelle gellar. you ve broke my heart by being delusional.
the problem is the rules of hollywood won t allow a woman to look weak. that one rules prevents a lot of potential good character arcs. like captain marvel  where she only had to realize how awesome she was and get rid of the oppressive men that were literally holding her back with technology that suppressed her awesome power.
i m here for the cat
contact me for your reward
buffy was one of my heroes growing up  since the kristy swanson movie to the last season of sarah michelle gellar s tv show  same with princess leia  she-ra  lara croft  ellen ripley  sarah connor  april o neill  eowyn  charlie s angel both the original series and the 3 first movies... i could keep naming names all day and all night  and i am not the only one that thinks and feels the same way  so why do these brainwashed asshats get to calls us haters  mysoginist or blame us for their failures  they destroy great characters that worked before  the message  and woke culture poisoned entertainment  they turn them into mary sues or and change anything good  recognizable and relatable of them and their stories turning it into gargbage and we are the bad guys for not consuming said garbage  hearing this bullshit from smg really hurts.
we mostly just want good writing and characters. i remember watching buffy  xena  charmed  etc. good shows  with female leads. most of us had no problem with that. but if the character is annoying  pushing politics  or just male- bashing  no thanks. and male characters have been getting shit on for decades. watch any movie from the 80 s onward  every male is seen as oblivious or dumb  or cheating on their wife  or are just the bad guy. it was a common trope.
......but she played an awesome female superhero.
some of the best film franchises have female leads throughout
after the frachise she was the lead on for so many seasons.... the nerve of her to say that
heavy metals lead is a female and was pretty sweet  but i could name so many successful female leads and main characters in games  comics and movies shows.
isn t funny how this rejecting of female heroes is a very new thing. maybe  just maybe it s more about the quality of what is being made
the math ain t mathin
if they pay attention  we trash male super hero movies as well  and more often. we want good story  great action that compliments the story and characters that we care about or love to hate. we re simple. alien and aliens worked because it s told using a female. those two movies don t work with a male.not gonna list all the female stuff  but one scene i love so much is from wonder woman at no man s land. they said  no man can go through there. she said  i m no man. then started doing hero stuff. or ahsoka when she was told by vader they vengeance is not the jedi way. she said  i m no jedi  and fought her former master with bravery.
if audiences only want male superheroes  then give the audience male superheroesit s entertainment give the audience what they are willing to pay for
so why was buffy such a massive thing back in the day. if the public only wanted male superhero s.
mcu needs to get it together. harley quinn is carrying dcu on her back.
now i regret that i actually watched every single episode of buffy and enjoyed it i totally regret that
when you said she-thor it sounded like  sheathwhore .
people only want male superheroes so then why did i watch  buffy the vampire slayer  20 years after it aired i still want jessica jones to come back like daredevil did.honestly some people in holly s wood feel like they say crap just to be relevant again.
audience blaming  has become so normalized  its very implication escapes them. complaining that audiences don t want to watch a particular show  doesn t improve the situation for the show  if the audience doesn t want it  then cancelling it is the only logical next step. they really are doing female representation a disservice by saying this  as they re only encouraging networks not to produce these shows.
plus an comic book series that is still going.....
i will always be team buffy so she can have whatever opinion she wants. people need to calm down
sarah just killed buffy  she stabbed her in the back.
there will always be a larger percentage of male hero s because of the simple fact that men are stronger and more aggressive and females have an inherent desire to be and feel protected.  that plays out in real life as well as film.  it s what the majority of male and female audience members want to see.
it s obviously not true  but what if the audience did want only male superheroes  isn t it their job to meet the audience s demands  if so  why are they deliberately going against what they perceive to be the audience s preferences
i never got invested on her 90s show.
i m probably one of the few men who only watches female streamers. i find them more carefree than the majority of male streamers.
are they forgetting about the women from x-men we re awesome. i m a man  i wasn t even think about them being female just they were great.
captain janeway  played by kate mulgrew  from star trek voyager is probably my favorite fictional character from film tv.modern writers simply lack the ability to be able to portray interesting characters with that level of depth and personality. and the actors they cast are equally uninspiring.
emily blunt or charlize theron would have been a more charismatic captian marvel. either one would have taken that character  who wasn t well received in the comics   and made them a likable character. also  they should have left marvel a man. dennis quaid would have been a great marvel... the man s body is unbelievable currently at age 68!!  why has he not been made a superhero yet !!
where s the  modern audience   i thought they loved this stuff
while there are exceptions to any rule  hero power fantasies are largely had by men  the same way love friendship fantasies are largely held by women. that is not to say men don t want female action heroes  we love tomb raider  buffy  black widow  etc   or that women do not want male touchy feely characters  women love the winchester brothers . all it means is  in order for either to be successful  it still has to appeal to the demographic that the product is most likely to be consumed by.modern  strong female characters  are every bit as toxic  entitled  self-righteous man-haters as the women making these products are in real life. nobody wants to see arrogant pricks put down the viewer both on and off screen  so nobody shows up to support the product when it is released. that  on top of overall poor quality of entertainment these days are the sole reasons female superhero movies flop.finally  the average man would love to see more strong female characters wrecking shop and saving the day. that has never been a question worth discussing. the ratio of female action heroes that are beloved compared to male action heroes has always been far closer than the ratio of female to male action heroes that have existed. we can get 100 male heroes and love 10 of them  while at the same time only getting 10 female heroes and love 5 of them. it is actually quite impressive these multi-billion dollar companies are so consistently failing to achieve something that is so hard to fail.
funny i remember everyone watching buffy back then.
superficial perspectives from superficial people living in a  bubble  seem to have the hardest time grasping what people truly want but it s actually fairly simple...we ll take male and female superheros from existing creators and publishers as long as they are canon in existence  perspective  attitude  and the like and as a result their dialog is also canon for the vast majority...if any improvisation is allowed or ad lib thrown in we detest it if it veers into the realm of sociopolitical issues which have little to no relevance to the universe in which they are by canon residents. leave out the sociopolitical jargon as it is not welcome where it was never originally introduced in a comic book series  or ridden into the dirt by those same ip characters by their original designers and instead of pissing  bitching  moaning  and complaining when some ethnic group isn t represented create original characters that fit the desires to have that decried issue resolved rather than attempting to place a  token  ethnic individual into a position and part which was never canon anywhere. if you invent it you can do what you want with it...if you didn t invent it stick with how the inventor and writers put them together throughout their own comic book series sets. that s the predominant issue...if you want overt creative license and to put your own sociopolitical worldview into the mix of something it had better be something you created from the ground up yourself not hijacking someone else s creation to spew your personal drivel.
funny how a woman who was basically set for life due to the fact that people like watching kickass women on screen is now complaining about people not liking kickass women on screen. but there were also movies such as the first wonder woman and alita that people also liked. but you know  those aren t good examples because they had some sort of vonurability to them and therefore were not only actually relatable  they were also likeable to men. which is a horrible thing.
the fact sarah michelle geller of all people is saying this is shocking. she should stop listening to freddie
you d think that with the numerous movies and television series  i watched a lot of  wonder woman    bionic woman  and  xena  in my day  in the past  smg would know better than to make that claim.  by the way... velma dinkley in the live action scooby doo movies was hotter.  just sayin .
hell  i even play skyrim   fallout sometimes with female  hero  characters.  hundreds of hours lol.
it has nothing really to do with the gender. there is plenty of good female protagonists over the years  mainly from the older era . the reason the modern movies and tv shows with female heroes fail is because it is insanely forced with a woke message rather than focus on making a good film or tv show. instead of trashing men  just make a good movie. simple.
to be fair  she s getting older. she is in the autumn of her years. her memory is fading. it s understandable that she forgot there was this entire era of female-lead action shows and everyone watched them because they were full of women and also that normies loved wonder woman. her decline is very sad.
dude...sarah michelle gellar was the action lead and she was super hot. most everyone i knew had watched the show. the brainwashing has conquered her.
even if it were true. not giving the actual target audience the products they i ll consume  is a failing business model.  it s really that simple. blaming customers for not buying a product they don t want or need is pointless.
love the kitty cat photo bomber.
i wash shocked at how bad captain marvel was. i watched it after re-watching captain america  and remember thinking captain marvel felt like an early 2000s movie  not something that released in 2019. captain america has aged surprisingly well.
i can t believe gellar  who played a female superhero on a popular tv show  is bending to the mob. how the mighty have fallen.
we need a melonie mac superhero to save us all....... tbf........... lmao..............
to be fair she hasn t been relevant since buffy ended back in  02 hence the shilling. same time she of all people should know how disingenuous her overall statement is and this is coming from an actual fan who watched every then new episode of buffy from season one onward and also angel even though that 4th season was rough lol.
8 17 look at smg on scooby vs her recent photo  then look how that compares to melonie  smg is mad that she isn t as pretty as she used to be.
people just want good movies. if the movie is good people will watch it and love it. the sex or skin tone of the star is irrelevant. racist  sexist  phobic accusations are the standard algorithmic defense when people dunk on bad and or overrated movies.
if the films treated their female characters correctly maybe then the audiences would be interested instead of changing the characters personalities to fit into the agenda
we need a meme of melonie head on the history channel alien meme saying tomb raider lol
there are good female superheroes and female protagonists in movies. wonder woman jessica jones the bride from kill bill buffy the vampire slayer. you can make a good female protagonist good inspiring both male and female audiences without either pandering to the male demographic with cheesecake or pandering to the other by saying girl power and doing nothing else. it comes from a dedicated writer and not what some agenda wants you to say.
hi melonie i hope your weekend is nice relaxing for you.
an addendum..... wanda was fantastic  and i saw that in the theater for her  not strange. if every woman in the  nerd  space didn t cover henry cavill s bowel movements  i d say that all more carefully  but elizabeth olsen was sexy and badass  and is a great actress  i like cavill as well  not my point .  i m on your side  let s just pick our battles wisely  eh  cheers.
alright if these people really believe that then why not give the people what they apparently only want  so they go out of their way to not to give the masses what they want and then complain when the masses don t support what they give when they knew what the audiences wanted the whole time  oh  the irony
so after seeing this i was watching some tv and i guess she is in a new show called wolf pack i feel like it wont be good after hearing all this lol
so if us guys only like male badass characters  why is it that i remember all of these without breaking a sweat  samus aran - tifa lockhart - jill valentine - claire redfield - ada wong - faith connors - heather mason - lara croft - velvet crowe - senua - aloy - yennefer - triss merigold - 2b - cirilla fiona elen riannon  ciri  - imma stop here cause is getting out of hand lol
lol that funny cuz buffy is one of the best superheroes on tv lol
i liked shehulk  because i went in understanding the original character. i want x-men. i want rogue. storm. psylocke. give me good female heroes  and i will watch.
wrong sara! so wrong we do not want only male super heroes. what we want is well written characters and stories...which i guess that rolls out the entire superhero genre regardless of gender.
i used to love her.......now i am so mad upset . i loved buffy now i m sad
no  they want characters that don t suck and are more than just an expression of gender identity.you d figure someone that spent years as a  superhero  would know this.  but nope  she s got to jump into the gender-war and wave a victim flag because that s the virtuous thing to do now.
...fans want continuity...
buffy saying people refuse to watch female superheros is more than laffable plus her husband writes for wwe and for a long time becky lynch had the torch at wwe.
as long as hollywood doesn t get rid off the  anti-hetero  and  anti-male  stance they are in  nothing will change with movies and tv shows. i get that the whole epstein and metoo stuff was horrible  but we have to move on. focusing only on female  gay and queer stories and characters and rejecting and ridiculing everything manly and hetero is not going to work long time  audiences are rejecting that. we have to move on and get over our traumatic past in a healthy way.
she s not very self-aware  is she  she was buffy ffs
how about having a good story and script so the female super heroes are given the necessary tools to succeed.
the black widow movie should have come around the winter soldier and civil war. she kicked ass in those movies.
even if so  nothing wrong with that wish. rather see a male superheroe than shehulk.
if the female superheroes would focus on actually doing super hero stuff and not sitting around making snarky comments about how they  do it better than men  all the time i probably would enjoy their movies more. male heroes don t randomly make jokes about how  a woman couldn t do this .  they focus on being bad ass and doing cool flips n shizz.
she can take it with jennifer lawrance  because as we all know  there hasn t been anyone before jennifer lawrence.
the word audience makes it seemingly more acceptable for the corporations and their puppets to use in criticizing people who don t like what they produce and sell. it s a transaction plain and simple. not a social experiment. they re selling a product and we re customers. if a restaurant changes their menu and recipes why in the depths of hades would they shame a customer s taste that they themselves had successfully set
01 03 when whole cast of males is replaced with females  and there are not so subtle passive agressive remarks towards its audience you can tell what kind of message they trying to sell usat this point i m worried we never get good female superhero movie
people only want male superheroes .try telling that to  firefly serenity  fans. just try. hope your insurance is paid up  if you do.by the movie serenity  river tam earned our hero-worship. she d been through hell  and became the female equivalent of wolverine w o the healing powers  she didn t need claws... and in serenity when they showed her fight  she didn t stand and go toe-to-toe  it was a graceful ballet  makes sense considering summer glau was a trained ballerina   much like christian bale s gun kata in  equilibrium .and then there s zoe... you ever been with a warrior woman   fans will recognize the quote . she s the offspring of samwise gamgee and boromir.
buffy the vampire slayer was a female  superhero  for seven years.  it got kind of stupid as it moved forward  but my wife watched it to the end.
hey  melonie i just want to say that was sarah michelle gellar a female superhero in buffy vampire tv show  anyway i thought so bc she would go after bad enemies and strike them with a wooden spike to the heart to kill them. anyway i just wanted to say that there is no reason to have a female superhero at all and i can say that there are several women that are superhero like gal gadot as wonder woman   zoe kravitz as catwoman in 2022 the batman movie and linda carter as wonder woman in 1978 tv show  ok melonie. anyway any men and women can be superhero too and men and women can be playing a superhero part too  ok melonie. anyway i just want to say that there is no reason for both women and men to be a superhero in movies and on television shows and they can do both if they want to be a great superheros  ok melonie. anyway i just want to make a comment about this video topic for today  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great day today and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also hope you have a great time on fnt this evening  ok melonie. anyway god bless you and god bless your hard work that you do for your fans. anyway have a great evening melonie.
i honestly think this media gender war would be resolved if they brought back sex appeal in female heroines. you can write a character as intelligent and strong while also having sex appeal.
melonie dude you are the best
black widow deserved a captain america and the winter soldier kind of movie feel  something a bit more gritty. they completely messed up task master  made the character forgettable when they could have been awesome if handled correctly.
ghost in the shell   sailor moon   msg  the witch from mercury   metroid prime    xena  warrior princess   bayonetta   mulan   70  of the most popular magic the gathering characters  95  of the most popular pokemon characters   cyberpunk 2077
saw a video of jennifer lawrence saying something similar as sarah michelle gellar also the only movie show that i didn t enjoy was she hulk it was because of men being portrayed as shit human beings plus what does twerking have anything to do with being a superhero
what they don t understand is that you can t just gender swap a female superhero for a male one and expect it to succeed. there are fundamental differences between men and women. qhat works for male characters doesn t work for female characters and vice versa.
crazy how so many of these people come to hate what made them rich and famous....sad
people only want male heros  i m not certain about the other films nearly as much but the only problem i had with the plot of the latest doctor strange movie is that it was not a doctor strange movie  it was a wandaverse movie and i never saw that show so the entire thing really wasn t very interesting to me. if other movies suffer from the same problem in the mcu recently then i would say you re ignoring the criticism of not making the product that you are selling something as something it is not to  look at all of those bigots .besides  wonder woman would not have been anywhere near as much of a hit as it was if there wasn t a market demand for it
on the contrary  mcu-fans wanted a black widow movie for years. marvel disney is setting female diverse heroes to fail. they use them as a gimmick and hope that will be enough to make their movies shows successful instead of putting hard work into them and giving them proper quality control. the black widow movie we got was freaking insanely bad and i really really wanted to like it  but i couldn t. she hulk was given to an absolute hack  so was mom s script and others and would be equally bad if all the heroes were men  but then they wouldn t have the pre-made excuse.
lol. literally dozens of female action hero movies over the last few decades in successful franchises. sarah is either willfully ignorant of this  or as melanie here says  simping hard for a marvel superhero role.i m actually a fan of her earlier stuff.
sounds like sarah is looking for work
well  i always thought buffy was a long lasting successful female led action series but apparently i was wrong. sarah michelle gellar probably thought that as well until this point but recently we all learned that jennifer lawrence was the first female action hero  actress  human and even first beeing in existence  so we were all wrong  buffy was a dude all along  so was lara and ripley as it seems...
we need more female leads. please men  make a movie for us to be the lead in
she s salty she can t get work.
maybe  gellar can claim to be a man  portraying female characters.how many marvel cinema universe movies have an actress as a lead character does gellar expect to find employment openings by insulting the other companies openly swearing allegiance to one...while insulting the fan base and opinions ofthe public...is her value to entertaining the slobs so necessary  her outcry of howa problem exists can be fixed with words whatever credits or faithfulness she claims to marvel  comes from a job skill.i remember my first marvel experience  buying a print comic  56 years ago.the world geller lives in  regardless of her mouth and employment  the producti  consume  should she have contributed  will then have her a part of it.in what way is my opinion choices not valid...because she thinks otherwise
this is the same fan base that was upset when black widow didn t initially get a movie along side the rest of the original avengers cast
kristy swanson is the true buffy.
salt is the best black widow movie. captain marvel has been the lead of her franchise for decades.
bad writing is what kills actors career and it s not that people don t want male super hero only
i d trade another new buffy season for that whole she hulk season. buffy didn t drag men.  and don t forget willows characters. a character ahead of her time. we just need more original characters. we need more sara conners. hell bring back the show alias. i don t mind a black cat spinoff that would make more sense.
lul wasn t her whole buffy career based on a superhero female ! wtf  lol
am i the only straight white christian male who loves buffy the vampire slayer and xena the warrior princess
writers today only know how to write women one way and that s emotionless with a  i don t need no man  attitude and a story that centers around women s plight. they basically end up just making the woman a man.
i still have my doubts about cpt marvel making 1billion.
vandavision was suspenseful and they used their special effects budget smart. hawkeye i thought was better than her comic book. ms marvel was ok  i think i would have enjoyed it more if i was a teenager  i m 53 . she-hulk the visual design i think was good but the scrip was horrendous  those people should stick to writing fan fiction for themselves and never again be allowed to write for a living or publish any more drivel. you could have had a male  gay or straight  character go through the same as her and react like she did  i would still be stupendously stupid and really  really bad.
wonder woman was the standard that they should have followed. it wasn t woke  it had a great story and it made money.
buffy was a flawed character  that struggled to do the right thing  struggled to train  and despite being given super powers gad to work in her skills...how does she not see that is what is missing today.
and she explains the success of the first wonder woman movie how
if black widow had been released when it was suppose to be instead of 3 years later  it would have been great.  as far as the light hearted forced hysterectomy jokes vs not being able to really talk about it  that part is simple.  everyone processes and deals trauma in different ways.  yelena just accepted what happened to her and moved on where natasha laments about the potential family that was stolen from her.the only female lead movie i could not stand was captain marvel.  i didn t like how they changed key characters  brie larson only seems to have one facial expression and that s resting bitch face  and the story itself was subpar.  it s the only marvel movie i actively skip whenever i watch them.
in the name of d.i.e. we should watch shit on tv
people only want male superheroes  quote from a woman who played a female superhero in a highly successful show that ran for 8 years during a period of time that didn t have all the progressiveness and inclusivity incentives of today.
anyone notice how mel s answer to everything is lara croft  girl crush....
buffy was superficially exactly the kind of  mary sue  character that has been turning off audiences to female superheroes.  the difference was that buffy was well-written with many problems and faults  and because of smg s serious-as-cancer performance as the character.  that s one way to make it work.also  katee sackoff should have been captain marvel.  is that even questionable
hollywood just don t get it. they just focus on diversity over storytelling. it s obvious they re ignoring past franchises and films so they could throw shade at their audience  it s what they want and it s sad
given the success of buffy  one of my all time favorite series  her take is just not rooted in reality. in feel like is echo chamber banter from gellar. shame too.as a male  i don t  only  want male heroes. there s been fantastic female led entertainment. too many to list in fact!!!  problem is  they don t write for the story anymore  theyd rather write for self-gratifying activism.
no.we want interesting  well written heroes. not like we re asking for much but nnooooooooooooo! you guys just want to give us trash and telling us we suck for calling it trash.you made me  buffy! we exist because you made us! little miss  slayer gtfo!.bloody cheek of her!
it s becoming more and more apparent to me that the phrase  common sense  needs to be updated to uncommon sense given how fewer and fewer people have common sense nowadays.
git gud  - melonie 2023
men have the power fantasy  women have the romance fantasy. that s why men are the main audience for action movies while women went to the theater every week to watch titanic. that s also why boys prefer to watch gory vampire and werewolf films while girls are either team edward or team jacob when watching twilight.   males and females are just different in what they like  and males are accepting of women in action roles. we like seeing the ladies kicking butt. i mean  mortal kombat wouldn t be mortal kombat without sonya blade.
umpteen-squinchieth demonstration that being a great actress  and make no mistake  smg is great and still getting better  does not mean being either wise or smart. how could she possibly realize how those comments came from the mouth of buffy  and how can she not see the difference between joss whedon s writing and that of the m-she-u hacks  melonie s script practically writers itself  she  and the hundreds of other posters and videoers who will be lining up to criticize madame geller  never had an easier job in their lives. please  smg  just wake up and smell the coffee.p.s.  if this  as some particularly cynical persons have suggested. is angling for work from disney-marvel  that is even stupider. first  she is the wrong size and shape for the company that blew up natalie portman. second  it is becoming quite clear that disney are in serious trouble  and we will soon see cutbacks and cancellations. it s the last place she should hope for employment  given the likelihood that  even should she be employed  the movie or series would either turn out to be a turkey  or be cancelled evem before the start  or both.
look at queen of the south fk badass the lead is a woman the series is amazing
no we want heroes  female or male  who s existence isn t purely to virtue signal and pander to specific demographics. but actual awesome heroes made to be awesome.
swear i only know of sarah because of black ops zombies
what a shame. smg used to be really cool. i guess this is what happens when you re married to freddie for years  his brainrot must have been contagious.
so i was asking in a discord im in if anyone wanted to play hogwarts legacy and guess what a certain someone was like  as much as i would like to want to enjoy hogwarts legacy i can t in good conscience support anything to do with harry potter anymore  the way he put harry potter made me cringe because it seemed like this gay straightphobic person couldn t even be bothered to say harry potter even in text ps  i ll be streaming hogwarts legacy as well and will be banning anybody straightphobic in my chat  what i mean by straightphobic is anybody with a fear of straight ppl eg the whole trans community basically
she s just mad she hasn t been relevant since the 90s with freddie prinze jr. so she wants to make sure hollywood knows she s still around.
yeah  it has nothing to do with the fact that these shallow piggy-back characters were as poorly written as possible. the irony is that before this post endgame wokefest women characters where written with so much more depth. look at even agents of shield. feige used to want to distance marvel studios from abc tv yet he has yet to develop one single female character as complex as melinda may or daisy johnson.
people say the darnest thing...is this another case of  only male heroes
i have no problem with female lead superhero when they are well written  rich and pertinent. video games  series  movies even comics. if you can t write a good story no matter what gender your character have  it s useless to hide behind it. skills is the problem not gender.
actually i really want a psylocke movie but seeing how awful marvel is now i just don t want them to ruin that female superhero.
what happened to adam from the ending of guardians of the galaxy 2
the problem is this equality and diversity  thing... pushed on us in those woke movies ... just see ww1984  the whole promise was that having a partner and trying to have a family is making a woman weak ... what            it had so much feminism underlining tones   it killed the ww ip haha . people love female action stars and you can see it with   alien   red sonia   hunger games  kill bill   salt   aeon flux   atomic blond   mad max  the old guard  you can say charlize theron also nails perfectly like angelina   action roles  and a bunch of much more ... but you have to have a good script and jumping on the stream video aspect of female gaming ... the thing is gaming trash talk   you can be yourself on a male stream  fine example was filthyfrank  but try to be like that on a female stream on twitch ... oh boy   hahaha but since we all now live in equality and diversity lala lands ... you get woke games movies when females can with one hand kick ass to 200kg male bodybuilder... pr-ed not with story art graphics but with  if you don t own this saw it   your a misogynist  ...
buffy saying only male lead shows are liked  lol.
i want masculine men and feminine women. i dont mind feminine women as heroes  i actually really like them  but i am not gonna like masculine women in hero roles. there is a pretty big difference about mrs. incredible from the first film  and captain marvel. i would even say there is a pretty big difference between just the mrs. incredible 1 and 2. feminist icons are not likeable in anyway  and they usually come off as or are straight up villains.
i dont care what gender the hero is....i just want well developed characters with deep backstories and plots that dont deviate from their main point. if i can delete a character from the show and it still makes sense....you made a boring hero.
buffy goin  bananas.
smg and kevin smith ruined a good character in teela with that abomination of motu
reeva n princess baby leia were the bestest evar!
well  she s half right  the buffy movie bombed  but that had nothing to kristy swanson.  i mean  how the hell do you market a vampire named  buffy  to a movie audience   but i digress  the failed movie led to the successful show  which makes sarah michelle gellar the most unaware person on the planet.  i remember the 90s  if it wasn t buffy  it was xena!the fact that sarah michelle gellar said this is the reason why these franchises are failing  these twidiots who have been placed in charge of our beloved franchises  mcu  comics  star wars  star trek  doctor who  etc.  never cared about these ips and their apathy is bearing fruit.
sorry buffy. but it s just a bit easier for audiences to suspend their disbelief when they see the rock beating down hoards of bad guys... than it is to do so  when they see a 98lbs toothpick do the same.
wait.... she knows most buffy fans are male right
very disappointed! i thought the almighty buffster might have had the self-awareness to understand that 12  years of hamhanded activism has turned every ip it touches into clown shoes.
alita! hunger games!
what is she of all people on about   ..most people want well written leads and don t care about gender  and surely buffy proves that
woke disappoints more than not
i just want likable female heroes  we have them but marvel keeps insisting on making their modern era revisions.
that s cap. they want good female heros. the reason everyone hated captain marvel is because the character was awful to everyone she met. hostile  aggressive  insecure  bitchy  etc. people liked the first gal gadot wonder woman movie because she was kind and compassionate. she wasn t overtly hostile to everyone.
your so right  i enjoy movies with female leads if the movie was founded on that  what i don t appreciate is when a movie juxtaposes a women into a movie with a male lead such as james bond  he is a man which follows the traits of particular type of man  how are we to think that a women spy is also a player  the problem i have with just throwing female actors into these roles is that it s just not real. if you ever watch boxing do you think a 50kg women would ever knock out a heavy weight guy  it s ludicrous and these woke movies are.trying to push narratives that arn t based in really
besides the fact that there have been loads of female superheroes  isn t it ironic that by moaning like this she sounds weak  she s playing the damsel in distress. i also hate the hypocrisy of movies where it s mostly women beating up men  only occasionally other women. it s like we re supposed to believe that women are as strong as men but at the same time there s a taboo on hitting women  either way  it s all fiction in the movies. i always wonder what someone like smg thinks about the draft being only for men  or the fact that men do most of the dangerous jobs  smg is welcome to quit acting and work down a mine or join the marines and be a real life superhero.
i mean yea  male heroes are dominant in entertainment but doesn t mean female demand is non existent. there s just not as many on the level of batman  spider-man or superman besides wonder woman. wonder woman is for sure the greatest female hero. ripley  lara croft  princess leia and the bride are up there too.
the math ain t mathin.
and than someone decided to produce the power which has so many toxic feminist ideas that i decided to stare into the sun to cleanse my eye s after seeing the trailer.
the fact that she still thinks she s relevant is a marvel in itself...
there is no quality in recent movies. black widow wasn t good. my suspension of disbelief  was lost after second car crash and falling off a building. at that point  i felt she was just a terminator.  she hulk was just man hate  instead of bruce banner saving his cousin heroically by giving her a transfusion to save her life  she got it accidentally. and i m still bothered that she felt no remorse after killing those by dropping roof onto them.  captain marvel was horrible and i think that was more brie larson than the rest. may god bless you and keep you safe and well   you look beautiful  if i may say .
to be fair  she s always been delusional. when she took over the buffy role for the series  i prefer the campy film   she had the same attitude and superiority complex.
i named my daughter after charisma carpenters character in the show i loved buffy the show
black widow wasn t a bad movie  but it was a day late and a dollar short. it could have been better  but it was a solid mid-tier marvel film.
i seen this on digital tv.
that s not true  men do want to see female superheroes...  but the problem is in this generation...everything is woke now and has no soul in terms of writing and passion  so female lead superheroes aren t gonna be taken seriously if they re a  yass queen  archetype or are just completely unfunny and like to outline the fact that they re wahmen. there is a simple way to write a female character...just make them a likeable without outlining their gender...like seriously it s not hard to do that. if you write a good character that happens to be female then people will remember the character for their gender as well as the character itself for being likeable and having a relatable struggle goal their trying to achieve. so you get 2 things you want  without outlining the gender and having cringe woke writing  and people will like you for it as opposed to the writer s these days who really don t get it... writer s these days are becoming woke activists to shed light on their trauma to get their toxic message across while also getting paid large amounts of money for the shit they put out  cough cough jessica gao cough cough ...
she is just pissy because everybody hated revelation for being the teela show. even if people wanted a teela show  they would not want one where gellar voices her with a nasal valley girl accent and a terrible attitude.
testify  sister!   -
japanese anime studios are doing a better job of female-lead anime shows of any genre. last year i enjoyed anime series like boochi the rock  lycoris recoil  gundam witch from mercury  reincarnated as a sword  and even ensemble casts of spy family combining yor s and anya s abilities with limits.
if you want too watch a good black widow movie then watch  2019 anna .
wow the fact that smg said that has to be the most insane thing.  i was a huge buffy the vampire slayer fan and even the greatest i ever made was because we loved buffy and turned out her older sister at one point was not only and extra on the show and even bacame a makeup artist on the show for a while. both sadly passed away.  mind you it is said that sarah was the reason buffy ended cause people were major fans.  i grew up loving the original shera.  i think the original tomb raider more times that any other video game in have ever owned.  to this day i still am a huge fan of xena warrior princess fan and watch the show and im a dude.  so what is she talking about   the problem is that back then they were women where they were feminine  strong and bad ass and even if they were that feminine and just strong acting like ripley or vasquez from aliens  it didnt feel forced or like they were just trying to be men.  where now a days where they are made into male female hybrid types which takes away from them being women plus they are unoriginal characters. also they also make them like super over emotional or weaker now in the personality area perfect example of this are modern day lara croft and princess kitana.   that is my opinion though.
no we dont  just want male heroes. we want good writing great story telling and people who care about the project and the passion that goes with it. it doesn t matter either if the main lead character is a female or male. tomb raider is one of the most successful  franchise in gaming history same goes for metroid. and they are both female characters that i grew up loving and im a male.   my favorite female star wars character is ahsoka tano. if you can make a character that people of both genders actually  love then you just hit the ball bark. stop hiring amature writers and hire more professionals writers that actually know how to do their work with a passion instead of a person who has never wrote a screen palay in the first place. reashing race swapping characters is getting boring and overdone making it look terrible. i just want more people to make original characters  that people would care about instead of race swapping for political movements.
hmmm  seems she never heard of that series  buffy ...
might it be that the failure of the female-led superhero films is the result of sexism  sure  but that s unfalsifiable  not to mention  terribly rude to your audience . isn t a simpler explanation that the writing sucks  apply occam s razor.
man these names make anime sound more complex than a philosophy textbook
maybe they don t know how to make a great female superhero. i really like regan from inside job and she s a lead female protagonist. but when someone made a great female protagonist successfully it got canceled because of stupid reasons.  netflix already have l in their name what else can we expect from them.
buffy was a fairly feminist anti-male show  at least for its time. these days the anti-male stuff is so in-your-face that buffy seems  restrained by comparison.
right  sarah.  no one likes female superheroes  mainly because they re written horribly!  we d line up to see good characters that are well written and have depth and development.  when they re perfect from the start and they only fail because it is someone else s fault there s no appeal to the character.  fans can t identify with someone who is perfect every time they do something.now we have melonie to be our favorite female super hero.
melonie mac boom great amazing video
i made a terrible movie! why don t people love it   and remember to drink water.
seems like i remember it being  buffy the vampire slayer  and not  bubba the vampire slayer  just sayin...
buffy the vampire slayer is literally a superhero and one of the most iconic female characters of all time because she was well written and not an obnoxious feminazi stereotype.
people love female superheroes. what we don t like is lazy  gender-bent versions of male superheroes thrown at us through bait-and-switch media promising new adventures starring our favorite characters only to have them completely overshadowed by some shallow girlboss who is magically better at everything despite having little to no real experience and was written by people who loved the jarringly cringey all-girl scene shoehorned into the final fight of endgame
two words joss whedon s black widow  she didnt get hired by him for that or even called in to do anything in the mcu so she s bitter  and given how they took madem hydra and gave it to ellen from scienfield probably just based on her politics and work on 30 rock  she wants in  and figures the best way to do so is to play into their political base to finally get a job and get set for lifeand given all the backtalk and blackmail they got on him  from shacking up with eliza  to how he treated one of the pregnant cast members of buffy  to it being the other writers that actually knew what they were doing most of the time  not him  she figures she s got a pretty good way in here  and can guilt trip them into giving her a job to shut her up just given their connection to him  and his depiction of black widow given the sex shaming they do now with anyone hot in filmwhich while it had its moments of actually being sultury and badass  steadily got more and more bland as time went on  ending in her banging her brains out on a desk to spite dove the love from sexy beast as a stand in for some guy from miramax  and then having elane blow her nose rudely at her gravestone in her own filmlike what a pathetic end to what was supposed to be a pretty badass character like that  hell one must wonder if it was done to spite him above all else really.
i can tell you why a lot of guys don t watch many girl streamers. now you are very pretty and if a guy has a girlfriend or wife  who is the jealous type  sees him watching you then there is likely to be a problem. actually the girl streamer probably doesn t have to be that pretty anyway. lol.
buffy the logic slayer
buffy the vampire slayer was my 2nd alltime favorite tv show  right behind m a s h .   sarah michelle gellar is now just looking for renewed relevance  much like alyssa milano.  the last thing i can think of that had smg in a lead role was the crazy ones  iir the title correctly  with the late  great robin williams..... and that s been some years.
it doesn t matter to me if the superhero is male or female it matters if the story is good the recent black panther is a good example it was a super hero movie lead by a female character  but the under line story of it was going through the stages of morning and greving . as for her hulk  i liked the series they stayed close to the comics  i.e.  fourth wall breaking as for thor  love and thunder liked it having lady thor stay with the original comics   movies premise.   who ever holds this hammer  and they be worthy they shall have the powers of thor !  it literally spells out anyone could weild the hammer if it finds you worthy .
i m a guy and i watched xena and buffy growing up. she just desperate for work right now and she thinks going woke will get her gigs.not to mention it was men begging for a black widow and scarlett witch movie so many years ago but they waited till they started making trash to drop them and sw didn t even get a movie  she got a show.
i d love sarah michelle geller as a marvel superhero. not sure which one but it would be cool to see her as a proper superhero. she definitely kicked butt in buffy
she knows exactly what she s doing  she s out of job for quiet some time now. so classic blame game nowadays  everything is sexist  misogynistic  etc. . in other word she s looking for a job.
if you want good female heroes that s what anime is for
ah yes  buffy the vampire slayer whingeing about audiences not liking female heroes because misogyny.it s sad really.
talking about biting the hand that feeds you. eyeroll
if they made a movie about rogue or another popular female  and they actually made them sexy and feminine  people would absolutely love them.  the problem is they make all these  girl bosses  with terrible personalities and then cry when no one likes them.  protip   try making them have just a dash of charisma.
kitty kitty at 0 07
as in anything  people don t want to be preached to  they just want to be entertained. great story and writers equals great entertainment. there is no sexism  racism etc... just good entertainment.
if buffy was made today  sarah michelle gellar wouldn t have been given the opportunity to portray buffy  the character would be considered too white  too blonde  too beautiful  and too feminine. people don t mind female super heroes  people care more about great casting decisions  good writing  and staying true to the source material. personally  cinema has been oversaturated with comic book movies  smg should point that out.
my two favorite movies are wonder woman and captain marvel
she s trying to stay relevant  that s all. and don t get me started on how terrible the horribly overrated joss whedon is--a  male feminist  who is guilty of the typical  male feminist  behavior such as being horribly abusive to gal gadot and then hiding behind excuses when he s called out on it at last. his writing is the same unfunny one liners crammed in everywhere in everything he does  which renders characters unlikable. these movies get slaughtered because they re badly written above all  simple as that. how hard is that
as a man that loved buffy it legit baffles me that something this dumb could come out of the lead actresses mouth. seriously  what
of course people prefer male superheroes as portrayed in movies and tv   such things are masculine roles. if you want to have a female superhero  what makes a woman a superhero is far different from what makes a man one.you can have exceptions  a scarlet witch type character  where body type isn t as significant a factor  is an easy  superhero  to promote. female thor  aside from being a racist insult to nordic people  is an absurdity. thor s strength is all physical-based.  i m not going to go into how thoroughly disgusted i was by an ugly skank of color mis-representing the beautiful  majestic and angelic valkyrie who wandered the battlefield deciding what men would live and what men would die... oh  i guess i did. moving on... captain marvelous wasn t disliked because she was a female character  she was disliked because she was a supervillain being portrayed as a superhero. she was an awful person. not quite as bad as supervelma  but close.i can t comment on the mandalorian because i ve never seen it. i ve seen gina carano  and she s a fairly attractive woman  i hope for her to someday realize that she s a fairly attractive woman .i ve never played the tomb raider games for 2 reasons  primarily because i couldn t handle the camera mechanics. i m one of those people from the early days of 3d who got nauseous playing 3d games like dewm.  i suspect i contributed to improvements to the everquest engine due to my vocal complaints about nausea.  the other reason is personal and not relevant
ali larter from heroes should have been captain marvel.
i always wonder if smg was already that delusional or if her wife freddie prinze jr. had something to do with it... which by the way  his father unaiived himself at  the age of 22 and dated pam grier! he s already more interesting than the son.where s janeane garofalo  thora birch to put this valley girl down  smg was always hollywood s barbie ffs
she loves talking with her hands...
these folks just turn me off to hollywood in general.  so much so that i haven t bothered going to the theater since the first sonic movie.
sounds like she went woke now.they can be great heroes in movies  shows and not be political i want a good story for my movie ext  shows
shimada death!samus aran!
please  no. not her. we lost her to the woke mob
she-hulk was high jacked too. whatever we got wasn t her story. the story and cases made no sense
the problem isn t us not liking women superheros  it s us not liking bad superheros. make good ones and we ll like them  male or female. period.
she s right. my favorite male superhero is black widow.
lol i love the math ain t mathin
she is wrong. it isn t that we want a specific sex of superhero. it s that we want heroes that are actually  heroes . we want quality writing and quality characters. not token tropes and one note stereotypes. a good story is worth more than its weight in gold. a bad story has no value.
out of curiosity  melonie  were you ever a flyleaf fan
funny  i got a warning popup when i tried to post that  suggesting it didn t meet the community guidelines... when that s the topic of the video.
good choice
yes and still am
@meloniemacgoboom  i m so glad to hear that    i met lacey once  shes just the nicest person.
in the words of the rolly polly - git gud scrub
1000  agree   hihihi
2 48 haven t seen any mcu stuff since civil war cause i noticed that if you skip a movie or show you re gonna be lost in the next movie or show. like that doctor strange movie. i heard if you didn t watch wanda vision you were gonna be lost at some points and i don t like disney enough to give that much of a shit. but back to why i made this comment from why i gathered all shehulk did was set up planet hulk. it had no actual plot from what i heard
well  i was a fan of b tvs.
i watch this and think. . . . .  yeah  i guess miss gellar never played tomb raider - or even metroid
wait wait wait wait wait. the almighty buffy said people only wabt male superheros  has this person not looked at her own bank account. does she not remember her filmogrophy  she knows she got rich playing a female super hero rite
sarah michelle gellar is somehow relevant again  i used to crush on her as a kid but hate her show haha  loved the movie though
all my respect she just lost to say that i mean she was a badass vampire slaying goat now she is puppet
men were clamouring for a black widow film and she-hulk to be in the mcu - its not our fault they were bad
sarah michelle gellar doesn t think she s hot anymore.
people only want male superheroes   says the actress playing a female superhero for many  many seasons.
it s blatantly obvious that she doesn t really believe that and that this is just pandering
seems like people don t like buffy  that s why they watched it. it s like with video games   nobody likes female characters in video games   i think they are right  becouse the sorcress in diablo 2 was the most played character of all time  xd
!!whelp! ! at da least  be glad sarah did naught say brie created all the cool firearms in movies....though funny would have been epic.....
maybe the male superhero is the most prevalent is because men are overwhelmingly the soldiers and the protectors of society. maybe.
just thought about it chloe grace moretz wouldve been a greaat captain marvel. she was awesome as hit- girl and nailed being a bad ass while avoiding pushing an agenda. idk...
i agree  are you gonna wanna watch something where the creators and actors are calling you names the whole time  nope were gonna be out. have fun failing.
um  i guess that captain marvel  wanda vision and wakanda forever proved to be box office failures  yes
has she never heard of wonder woman and the terminator was a great movie and the most important character was a woman
shout out to you melanie
she used to be so cool
0 05 chubby cat!
mells bells!!!!!!!! acdc ft. melanieeeee
is she begging for a mcu role
it does have women in marvel lol my  1 favorite superhero on marvel is and will always be capitan marvel and she is a female    she kicks ass
that s why i dated tesla lmao she does the shockus pocus i m just nature god with robots man so what a guy can t be a nature a women can t be a hero but together we were a  couple i tire of these games now i m mad
i dont mind femail leads in any movie  if it is a good story it is a good story period  i remember i liked dark angel in my youth that had jessica alba as a lead playing a super soldier  and ofc the alien movies  long kiss goodnight great movie  the underworld movies were entertaining kill billzero dark thiryentrapmentaustraliaerin brockovichand many more.hollywood just need to dump the woke narrative and make movies with good stories  yes there are things that men are better at it dosent men we are trying to mansplain it to you  yes if you are sprayin throat spray on your throat instead in your mouth to your throat you are going to get the idiot treatment.
why would she say such a thing with herself being aprime example debunking her claim oh  she is trying to get back into full time acting after being  burned out .
good stories  marvel disney might as well look at a rock   yell  why aren t you water they re incapable of it  politics broke their brains.
if pepole want men the give it and make money ......don t see the problem
what!!!! hmmmm what s happening in this world.
i like rogue  storm  black widow  susan richards  wonder woman  zatanna  black cat  phoenix  shadowcat  etc.  etc.  what about captain marvel  femthor   riri williams   not really.   misogynist!!
honestly i don t want them.
bs we just want good women superheros with good main goal and not their main goal being putting down all men   superheros.
wtf  buffy.
honestly i rather see more female than male superheroes
love your tattoos have you lost count yet
weird  i keep hearing my thoughts come out of my computer speakers from this video. get out of my head!
in other words  she s not hot anymore so she needs to get attention a different way.
that s not even true sarah-michelle.   i loved underworld.  it had believable great characters and writing.  and i even really like buffy for the first 3 or 4 seasons.   but i hate bad shows.   i didn t like  for instance  what they did to supergirl.   i hated thor-amidala.  it was bad.
charmed!
says the woman who played a popular vampire slayer before most of the good comic book movies came out
i liked lady thor but that may be because i like natalie portman and for that film only thor  jane and gor were good. everything else sucked and that was largely due to the director who butchered ragnarok.write a good story with decent characters and people won t care if a character is a token.
didnt everyone like and want buffy  sounds like a cry to get noticed again because i really havnt heard of her in movies or shows since then. but maybe the movie industry currently isnt writting good roles for women because most of the ones they do attempt to make are full of propaganda or some sort of agenda. like only good one recently is everything everywhere all at once which was originally written for a lead male role but was changed due to michelle yeoh stating she wouldn t be in it unless the lead role was female.
these types act as though films and shows that depicts what they demand  did not exist 20  years ago.
not true at all  buffy be on crack.
my kids loved the female black panther  plus she isn t white.what is she talking about
her heydays have long past  yet buffy still believes she s fighting for others  in the name of who knows what  hahaseriously  she needs a reality check and a lesson on self-respect  because kissing up to marvel isn t going to help her career.
these actresses are just dillusional.
xena
if people only want male superheroes  then why is marvel doing the opposite of what they want
word. also can you pet the cat for me  thanks
what is she talking about   buffy was basically a female superhero and least that s what i thought.
here s another example of a hollywood type determined to be the dumbest person in town.  a claim to fame sought by so many  it s some of the most intense competition on earth.
was smg involved in something that cause memory loss and brain damage  poor girl can t remember that she did play a type of super hero for years. the show was super successful. that show wasn t the only one. lucy lawless played xena. she was more than plain human. super successful also. now before them. linda carter played wonder woman. compared to other live action superhero show wildly successful. linsey wagner played the bionic woman for a few years. another successful show. movies   helen slater stared in a supergirl movie that made money. famke jansen played jean grey in the x men movies. as for the mcu . people were angry black widow didn t get a better movie to showcase her. still for what it went through very successful. even though the movie wasn t that good captain marvel did pretty good.
so she has not really changed at all then.....she put down evey guy in the show...treaded them like total shit and they all end up simps ....
she is just saying that because if not she would never even be considered for a part.  she is old and has not had any big films in ages.   she is looking for a long term project that will finance the rest of her life.
i have buffy the vampire slayer comic  1. with puff picture smg cover she adorable. feminine and ladylike but not in a butch bitter ugly way. was. lara croft look like masculine barrel chested bruce jenner now congratulations west.
an actress that played buffy  basically a super hero herself  and no one ever complained about her being a woman  come and say this shit.another instance of about how selective is the memory of a woke brain.
yet she did a skit with jack black where he was spider-man and she was wonder woman. hypocrisy cubed
leia! red sonya!
oh because no one loved shows like buffy  charmed  true blood  xena  xfiles  once upon a time  heroes  lost girl  ghost whisperer  femme fatale  dark angel  sabrina  or veronica mars  geez these rich peoples lives must be so squeaky clean perfect that they get bored with existence and make up shit to get mad about. b   you were effing buffy! for yeeeeears!
what happened to sarah michelle gellar  i thought she was based. she married  retired from acting to raise her children  and seemed to be a rational woman.
yeah  i ll call smg with the name buffy  the slayer  summers...damn that actress is really not bright at all.
actually we do want female heroes we just don t want tweaking heroes thar dint you know do heroing and instead rack up a body count in bed then complain if they get rejected. also sara really wasn t a very good buffy in my opinion. i prefer the movie that came out before her show.
no  i want stories that are written to entertain and not written to divide viewers. simple.
so people only want male super heros then why did i as a male. grow up watching an liking an still like the shows like  xena warrior princess   buffy the vampire slayer  charmed the original series. then the new kung fu series up till it had that  blm episode then it lost me. movie wise the alien movie franchise their are others even cartoons and anime. all forms of visual media with female leads an i like it an still like it. that is because they had good stories and actual good storytelling in them everything made sense. now a days that s not the case it s let s make the females the best with no training whatsoever and let s make it  solely political and let s dump on men. then  in some cases like captain marvel or whatever let s make them completely  unlikeable. marvel directors and writers need to watch a youtube channel called film courage.  because they talk with people in and around hollywood.  like movie writers and directors an others around the movie making an tv show making industry. them they would learn how to make good movies an shows an anything. because they make it clear in one video you never attacked the  audience it never turns out well. you don t listen to that 1  of people on twitter it doesn t turn out well. you don t criticize and bash  half of your audience it does not turn out well.  then they would learn how to write an tell a good story. from professionals in their own  industry. i a am learning alot about how movies and tv shows are made an i an doing it for fun. but those people need to see it  to understand how to do their job that s  just sad.
she had a great show. i watched the bufgy movie and the show. she wants attention.
this is... disappointing for me. ....and the worst part is she   of all people  knows better... buffy was great... except for the musical episode... seriously did someone in the writers room lose a bet ...
didn t jennifer lawrence recently claim to be the first female superstar   wouldn t that put the buffy character out of running   edit   ah  mac mentioned that statement.no offense  ma am.  but could you turn off the windows   facebook sound effects when you are recording a video
explain how captain marvel made over a billion dollars. explain how black panther  wakanda forever made  860 million with female leads. the first wonder woman went gangbusters at the box office too.have fun with the nerdtronic crew tonight!
i remember watching evry episode of buffy lol
i haven t heard anything from or about gellar in literal years. she s just saying this trash for attention lol
when they make unrealistic female super heroes disconnects with the male female audience . just watch reacher instead.
yo  why you dancing in a hoodie on twitter you re so goofy  melonie
black widow movie coming out after she died was a stupid move on their part.
imagine they making a male wonder woman.... it would get equal if not more hate but it would just be overlooked and tey keep crying that female versions of existing heroes are hated cous the fans hate woman.
films led by female substitutes for male characters are not popular because people want the genuine thing  not a poor imitation.
sarah michelle gellar was one of the most popular pop culture action shows stars of the 1990s... how backward is her thinking if she held such a position yet makes this claim
marvel! marvel! marvel!like there s no other strong women in other movies. dc had the best superhero movie with a leading woman  wonder woman. battle angel alita was amazing  not superhero but better than  carl manvers  from disneymarvel.

omg it has 2 be good too  ! !     .    xd
i liked captain marvel. idk what people s problem was with it aside from being butthurt about it being brie.
it s all so tiresome
oddly enough the only movie that i liked brie larson in was scott pilgrim vs the world.  the math ain t mathing  lol.
commenting to feed the algorithm
i wonder  was someone payed to say  that
they do bad when it is a movie about hating men we just want a bad ass female being bad ass not making man hating jokes
omg cute kitty
well she s wrong.
misagony !!
dr strange was one of my favorites till the last movie... thor was basically unwatchable...  i have yet the see black panther but seem people making fun of it lol
love you
i guess old female lead characters doesn t even remember they actually were popular way before  feminism  wtf!
man hating  emasculating men  and gender swapping will turn people off. unrelatable characters also.  _gellar is ignoring black widow
uhhh . . . need to do better job of editing.  i meant to say in last rant that   melonie is our  armor  in this woke war.
buffy  alias  charmed - make the shows good and people will watch - make them woke and virtue signaling and noone wants to watch them
maybe marvel s woke writers are the problem and not the female leads
this host sounds and looks like frosk  lol
women spend their lives complaining when they could make the show themselves
no we only want good written heroes  male or female    stop changing heroes and mixing them up create new ones and if they are well written poeple will like them    gender does not matter seriously.   stoplecturing and start writing good stories that s all fans want that s all we ever wanted.
yeah buffy  what about tomb raider  huh  lol
what a dumb take ny her. i love wonder woman  lara croft black widow   gamora..... i love these women. raven from x-men.... they are ton other other great women superheroes that do not take over traditional men heroes like batwoman or she hulk
their biggest problem is they think we want knockoffs  she hulk  hulk rip-off  female thor um thor rip-off  iron heart  etc all rip-offs cheap clones of popular characters that nobody wants. how about we get rogue origin movie  storm  ladydeath strike  lady death  danger girl  or any one of the original characters out there that arent unpopular or carbon copies of other characters.plusblack widow failed because they tried to make it a big-budget action marvel film  it should have been a thriller espionage film akin to john wick not the family super hero romp that it was.
modern hollywood can t discern between strong characters who happen to be female and characters who are portrayed as strong because they re female.
she was buffy!
i don t mind female heroes  just have some serious  strong female lead  fatigue.
and if that s true who cares  really
maybe marvel should start making good movies and shows with female superheroes. that s just my opinion.
onlyfans is massively dominated by females  nobody s crying about that.
if that s true  well  give the people what they want then.   seriously.   this topic is so f  kin tired  dead  beaten  buried  and exhausted.   stop trying to force something  that isn t there.
like every video game and movie i ve ever bought has a female in it. disney has resorted to making the same movie again  and again  and again. all aimed at 12 year olds
this is sad i used to love sara michelle gellar when she stared in buffy the vampire slayer but now im starting not to like her based on the stupid comment that she made. people want good stories because these comic books were a way for people to escape reality
why are these actors actresses so hypocritical and bent on killing off their fanbase with such a stupid  shilling opinion    i used to love buffy
no  we just want heroes who are written well. gender and race doesn t matter.
everyone is now playing the victim card.. that s the new trend.. especially those that aren t getting work on big movies
wrong. people only want good superheroes  awesome characters in well-written stories.sarah sounds like she s smoking some of jennifer lawrence s stash. lets play their game for a minute  how dare you assume what other people want  why not just ask them  even with just a stupid twitter poll if that s all you have!
buffy the vampire slayer was literally a female superhero 25 years ago. what the actual f.i don t know if she s very bright...
like...what  like wonderwoman 1  buffy itself  xena and so on never existed  this is ridicilous.
guys like hot girls. so if they hate your show starring a hot girl then the problem isn t that the audience didn t like the hot girl. the problem is your show sucked.
xena! beatrix! ripley! angelina lara croft! sarah connor! fans pushed for a black widow solo movie!
i m misogynist when it comes to heroes.. if i was gonna be rescued i d hope for a male not a female to come through the door and save my life !!
no  we want the non annoying female heroes like uhm buffy. not like she hulk or captain marvel
i m sick and tired of marvel and dc movies and shows they re all the same and they never do anything different with them not to mention they keep getting woke and politically correct in the movies and shows this is why i watch anime
no just get tired of the forcibly inserted uninteresting female leads with no real character building who just show up and fierce woman roar over all the previously established characters like the whole thing is a trope now that we re all sick of  there are so many intriguing female leads out there and none of them have been recently a part of superhero society
insult the fans and get your acting job. doesn t matter if you re a has-been
then why are the masculine-ized female superheros doing so poorly
come on bandwagon pull her out of irrelevancy.
this is so stupid because the reverse is not true. fans dont like a male superhero because he is the right gender. people will absolutely rip apart a male hero that they dont like. people will criticize male characters but they dont get to cry sexism because they are not women. and by the same metric many female heros are very popular and it is not becuase they are women  its becuase they are good characters. like oracle from batman  mara jade from star wars  buffy the vampire slayer  kim possible  etc.
you mean dudes don t want to pay money to hear women nag them  i m shocked  i tell you.
female streamer  i need to see people who look like me to relate to and validate myself.also female streamer  why aren t more males watching my streams
these people don t understand that in these movies  the writing and directing was soooo bad  they ruined the make super hero s as well. we are rejecting the make hero s as well as the females in these movies. incompetence and cope.
she hasn t been relevant in decades and this is her trying to get some attention
another clout goblin  how the mighty have fallen lolsad to see her join the ranks of jennifer and eliza
so some one who was a female hero  was made famous by it  now claims we only want male heroes. riiiight...
we do not care about the gender of the superhero. scarlet witch is beast  and i want her to have her own movie. we do not like the preachy ideology they are trying to spread.  men bad  women good.  if you have she-hulk stronger than  world-breaker hulk because she gets catcalled... you missed me with that bs.
as much as i dislike her and the creator of buffy aka joss whedon i still love the buffy show and angel thoughts melonie
well that s rich coming her after all she played a buffy  a female led heroine. i bet she s saying that for attention.
sigh i keep saying  doesn t matter if women are the main lead  if trans are  if all the races and genres in the rainbow are  they just need to be... good! and don t shove crap down your throat  make them good and you have a billion examples of good women leading movies  just google.
smg is so stupid  i like buffy till this day. i like a good movie  not a hidden agenda  or a in face agenda  in the movie.
it s not even whether it s a female or male. it s just that most films these days are dog shit. no wait . that s an insult to dog shit
i call sarah bullcrap
female super hero s are just fine with me.  the thing i don t like at all is when they take a male character and just make a them a female.  or they inject tones of woke junk into the movie vs just being a super hero. wonder women 2 was garbage  but the first one was not bad at all.
and the resident evil movies they managed to get 8 films or something. just make it good and stop insulting 98  of your fan base
she s right  women should be subservient to strong men.
i don t even want male super heroes anymore. these people are neither super or heroic. i d rather watch a movie about animals at this point.
all these movies put men down or make them look stupid. why should i pay to watch that  buffy had strong male and female leads. who didn t love spike
my opinion  if you are a female feminist male feminist and a writer... write a comic  and if you don t do well with that  don t make shitty movies. pretty simple.
wonder woman is a fantastic film  great story and gal is easy on the eye. thor is fantastic  a great story and chris is easy on the eye. captain marvel isn t great  the story is poor but brie is easy on the eye. batman and robin isn t great  the story is poor but george is easy on the eye. make the story good or your film won t be great  gender isn t relevant.
black widow was entirely about men enslaving women... it s a virtue signal  the only man in the main group is a joke. mocking the fans cannot end well  even if the movie is otherwise watchable  i dont want a movie to succeed that pulls that crap.
her own best known character is a female hero.  she is mindlessly playing the victim card.
do these simians ever seen watch tv and old movies with female heroes
guess what  women can make bad movies too. equality!
when i get criticized as a viewer  i.e. the client  i simply stop watching. so buh bye smg
that s not true - people just want good superheroes - but even if her dumb claim was true  what could we do about it absolutely sod all. certain things just appeal to certain genders. men like football. women like footballers.
i think she has misread the situation.it is not that we only want male heroes.the female heroes have suffered from poor writing compared to those of the earlier male superhero movies.stop trying to tell some sort of feminist tale of a mary sue  and instead show us a heroic person fighting against great odds to overcome a very powerful opponent.
ha nope its not that we hate female superheroes we hate bad female superheroes done wrong
now i am angry again. no female superhero since the last female superhero. no female superhero between the last female superhero and the female superhero before that. they are a lot of movies without a female lead left. even if they are fewer and fewer  and even if the lead is gay or a weak clown  if it s no female superhero. but i see a huge problem  non of them is disabled. they all are ableists. especially sarah michelle. look at her. so arrogant. so pround of her limbs. smiling and showing  she has teeth. blinking with their eyelids. and why does she do that  because she has eyes! and otherwise they would dry out! i am so angry now!
not really  but i dont want entitled people with anti social behaviour bitching if i dont like something trying to label me as something i m not just because i dont support their particular political beliefs
yea  people didn t like scarlet witch or black widow did they. people neither male or female had a problem with female superheroes. what they have a problem with is people spewing this bs and replacing and weakening males.
wanda vision did really well
first elizabeth banks  then jennifer lawrence  and now sarah michelle  geller.... wtf. they just repeat the same feminist tropes over and over again.
no  we want female superheroes who are actually feminine instead of trying to act masculine and be  one of the guys  or telling the male superheroes to check their privilege and all that bs..... if the female superhero is going to act like a guy then they should just be replaced with a guy.  female superheroes can be both feminine and powerful  instead of a dude with breasts.  that s just my thought on it.
people don t want movies led by female derivatives of male characters. those are insulting both to men and women.
yeah nobody wanted buffy at all huh
benedict cumberbatch deserved to get bogged down and having women take over his movie because he said we should raise boys to be feminist.
tbh i d rather have more female heros  i like seeing woman kick asd.but they just write them bad and keep inserting cringe feminist sjw crap and complaing about men and bring other characters down instead of bring themselves up. a lot of female characters are popular in anime cos they are so much better then garbage modern hollywood.  underwold and residents evil did pretty well and are fun
really  i think people just want good heroes and movies...not any of this pandering bullshit. that girl power scene was cringe in end game. yet in the dc animated universe there has been ton of kick ass female super heroes done well and everyone loved the dcau from batman the animated series to jlu.
smg is a terrible person that only cares about smg.
the black widow movie was a terrible movie. it was she said as a superhero film
didn t she come from one of the biggest action series ever made  that also still has a huge cult following  she is just mad she is almost in her 50s and has hit the wall. this imaginary sexism is boring now. the stupidity is laughable. the writing in these mcu movies has been terrible. nobody wants to see smg in a marvel movie.
was jennifer lawrence   sigourney weavers  inspiration for doing the aliens films   supergirl was good at the start   it just seemed to be getting turned into virtue signalling garbage from season 3 onwards .
underworld had terrible lore
when all you supply is 2 dimensional mary sue s  dont be surprised if people arent interested. characters need to be complex  have successes and failures. have flaws .... not be endlessly better. but then female characters today are more a feminist deity we are to worship and thats never going to happen.
smg is no longer relevant and an idiot. we like women superheroes as long as the story is well made with good writing. but hollyweird seems to want to destroy everything they touch.
the 90s are over buffy. they were fun  but their gone  and you re no longer relevant.
wait good stories  get outta here with that crazy talk
natalie dormer would have been a better captain marvel  she can pull off the snarky arrogance of the character while being likeable  while brie was just arrogant and condescending
rollseyes - yeah  like lynda carter  lindsay wagner   lucy lawless never existed  right   and no one ever watched  or would watch again.  huh.
even women dosent want female superhero so that meant womensagony
no we want female superheroes we just dont want woke ones same goes for the male superheroes
my guess is  gellar here is a ragingly sexist misandrist.
you cite buffy as a reason why female lead projects are successful even though it s counter part show with a male lead angel was much more popular and successful and last longer. buffy was given to 3 different networks during its run. lol do your homework atleast if youre going to sprout your pick me ideology
she s right  though. women simply don t put themselves in danger to save other people that aren t kids. female superheroes are just not believable.
i personally do not like super heroes. but a good movie like tomb raider  and resident evil series was awesome. but i will not go and watch a movie that is going out of their way to drive it into my head about gays or color diversity. i have black and gay friends. they will not watch that woke trash. neither will i.
nope female superheroes are fine. as long as they are interesting and act female. kind of like buffy did  and not at all like capt marvel did.
no  we just want good movies with women superhero. ww was great but ww84 was so bad it maybe the word superhero movie of the last 15yrs to me.
i don t want all males plots forcefully ended so they can all be simultaneously replaced with females.and i don t find propaganda trying to create an  equitable  space as entertaining.
she hulk is a failure due to the actress   it all falls on the actor and the writing and who ever picks these actresses and ok s the scripts they should be fired.  she hulk  captain marvel and black widows sister were terrible actress to put in these roles just as the last charlie angels movie that had a chitty director  terrible actresses and a crappy script but banks blames the male population for her inability to do her job which is what they all do today
didn t buffy run for 7 seasons years before the mcu even started well  isn t she married to a beta-male  that would explain her poor takes lol
ugh.  girl who played uber-popular female superhero  now throwing around the victim card.  how stupid.  my dad  brother  and i geeked out over buffy back in the 90s  played tomb raider till we went blind  could quote the alien and terminator movies  both female led  front to back  and frequently did  and saw wonder woman in the theater twice because they were awesome.  we ducked out of the modern marvel movies because they were propagandist trash.  over this fan-baiting crap to the nth degree.
who cares lol
buffy was a terrible series!
i strongly disagree  i dont care if the character is female male as long as the story and acting is cool  but this woke bullshit no one want cares bout.
ya generally shes right
woman who played feminist superhero believes feminist bs.  how  un surprising.
comic book heroes are dumb. . . never understood the fascination.
blackwidow sucked taskmaster is and always will be a man
ummmmmm .my favorite superhero is elektra so .miss me with that bullshit.
wrong  sarah. like everything else  you guys have  all lost the plot recently  and we dont like being forced an agenda  we can see it  and we told ya ll we dont like it. deal with it.
another performer with absolutely no understanding of how entertainment works.
i don t mind a women superhero  but when the woman superhero bashes men and is a feminist.  gtfo.
shes wrong  all the male marvel heroes suck too
same old boring narrative ..it s all so tiresome.
hypocritical coming from the same cult who preach about representation
