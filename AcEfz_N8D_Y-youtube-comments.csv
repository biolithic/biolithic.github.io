if you look up her personal history  mindy is also one of the most privileged people who has ever existed. two extremely successful parents both in high-paying careers  went to an ivy league university  and got a great job directly after graduation and has been working in show business ever since. she has no excuse to be bitter or to hate modern society for any reason.
kaling  you ve beaten me at my own game.delisle  don t flatter yourself  you were never even a player.
gotta give her props for trashing the show in the most stylish and azula   daphne way possible
fred being the most well liked character kind of reminds me of archie bunker from  all in the family .  archie was cast as the bigoted  ignorant  sexist  stupid conservative character  as opposed to the enlightened and intelligent michael stivic who was the positive role model of the show.  or he was supposed to be.  but it was archie who became the most popular with the audience  despite his many flaws.  he was the most relatable.  he became a household name  while few people even remember michael s name... but you might remember him by his nickname   meathead .  rob reiner  the guy who played him  is quite the meathead in the real world as well.
mindy kaling seems like an insufferable person. who hurt her  i hope you re having a wonderful day. and congrats on 110k subs melonie
good call on her using the show to lash out at her rejection. now that you said that  i can see it. it s like the saying goes   hurt people hurt people. .
not just any actor  azula is spitting fire
the shadow that bred them can only mock. it cannot make. not real things of it s own.                                jrr tolkien
this show united everyone in hatred  its beautiful lmao.
mindy kaling used a beloved 60 year old franchise to vent her teenage-frustrations. my bet she literally is this version of velma
ah  the glorious shade from grey delisle threw was just  chef s kiss  deliciouswhen the va for daphne and princess azula throws shade  that s just another nail in the coffinalso yeah anime can go too far  depending on the anime  but even that has standards and is not some rule 34 self-insert fanfic
mindy velma  azula always lies  azula always lies.sane people  no  she s telling the truth.
i just want to take a minute and say  damn melonie you look great with your hair like that
velma actually makes the live action movies look somewhat decent.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.
when robot chicken s scooby doo vs jason is more faithful and wholesome than a scooby doo  spin off  like this that says alot.the velma characters in this spin off can come to camp crystal lake and nothing of value would be lost
this is just amazing! i love seeing when people from the original work that this series is based on come and call this pos out! honoring the lore and doing justice to your work is important and she knows that! thank you  grey  for standing up speaking up about it! you re a real wild card  sweetheart! love you so much  hon!
it s disgusting that she can get away with this  especially knowing what would happen if the roles were reversed.
grey never fails me  anything she s in is gold
she gets to say she saed a guy on live tv and audience laughs ...meanwhile yt is deleting mens rights channels
its hijra  look it up !!!
i think her  excuse  to be bitter is that despite all her privilege  her rich parents  her connections  etc  she is still little more than a hollywood footnote. she s known by regular people as a writer actor for  the office  and... thats it. she has had little success in any of her other ventures. i imagine she feels entitled to hollywood superstardom but she will never get it.
actually  even women who have been raped repeatedly aren t typically hateful. i know  i ve had quite a few female friends over the years  and i do happen to have a psychology degree.
its very often the case with most outspoken virtue signaling woke people. they didnt grow up with much struggles and adversities  so they go out in the world trying to find the north to their lack of moral compass
its almost like someone should remind her of that
lucky  yes.  advantaged  yes.  privileged ... no.
@hiraghm  lucky is a literal synonym for privileged lol
it sounds like she just worked hard. i can t knock her for that. but she was able to do that because she does have the privilege of being an american. not because of her race. and that s her claim  that white people are successful because they re white.
because to these people  the mere fact that people who disagree with them exist is a blight on their perfect worlds. if you re not exactly how they want you to be  they ll pounce on you like rabid hyenas.
azula reference  nice
yep  that s a good one there  man!
sweet azula reference
@whatahorriblenight  the daphne actress throwing shade at her actually won grammys lol
while i can t stand her and i certainly didn t come from privilege there s nothing wrong with people that did it simply means their parents were successful isn t that everyone s desired outcome
perhaps she got bullied or called out in school  and she holds a lot of petty and petulant grudges against them
@blaaaaah51  no its not privileged- having special rights  advantages  or immunitiesluck -success or failure apparently brought by chance rather than through one s own actions.
@blargy2inch  you replied the definition lol i said synonym
well  duh! and she doesn t hate modern society  but you can because it s full of disgusting  vile  narcissistic people in it  so it s not like it s wrong to do that like the activists in the media and on the left are claiming! this is just pathetic! not like i hate mindy kaling or anything obviously  she s done some great work on things like the office  the mindy project  which is semi-biographical satire based on her life  which was really good and probably kinda underrated at this point  and she s written episodes of parks and rec  among other good things in her career! so she s got talent  she just needs to know where to use it! that s all!
in theory  i could respect someone who grew up privileged but was still bitter at society - for example  because other people are still suffering. but that s not mindy s reason.
@scottdoesntmatter4409  agreed. a good friend of mine is a woman that was molested by her father repeatedly in her childhood and teen years  and she is married and loves her husband with all of her heart. she s actually confided in me that she doesn t respect people that hate other people just because they happen to be in the same social group as whoever harmed them.
except of course she is because nobody liked her show
@blockmasterscott  actually  blaming groups of people for the actions of a few is usually a sign of lower intelligence. it s a form of thought shortcut  aka prejudice. this is actually an ingrained trait in human thought processes  you can never ever get rid of it short of genetic engineering on a vast scale  species wide. it can be minimized however.that said  there are rare instances where it is justified to react that way  after you ve investigated why certain groups harm others.
the double standards or just mind blowing  if it was a guy no debate
unless... i m right
key word ivy league  her education system brainwashed her to hate modern society lol
@whatahorriblenight  she wrote  ran  and stared in her own show. it ran for 6 seasons. so i would say that was a success. her other hbo show   sex lived of college girls  has gotten good reviews. but i think it s terrible. mostly because the actresses in it are not very good. either way  velma is bad  yes.
did mindly write velma or did she just voice act her cause ik she looked familiar and thought she was kelly from the office and i turned out to be right  and now i m like there s no way she wrote this show given she played in the office.
all these revolutionary style whackos do  having grown up in extreme wealth and privilege that would ve helped you or me out.
well she is azula  she throws so much shade it s a pass time
actually didn t know she also voiced azula and now that i do her sassy nature suddenly makes so much more sense and i love it.
yep! she s just amazing and isn t afraid to take aim at anything like this that ruins the name of scooby-doo! nice work defending her show s legacy and continuing to just want to make fans happy! she is just a true winner!
@taejasper1343  i love everything about her been a fan of her since high school when i got into who voices my all time favorite cartoons and tv shows from my childhood. grey delisle and tara strong have come a long way and im glad grey defended immediately she s a queen.
omg that is such a good point! i grew up watching all in the family. hated meathead and loved archie  flaws and all
also because the late carroll o connor was funnier than rob reiner ever has been. even as a kid  i thought archie was funny and meathead was an insufferable oaf--kinda like in real life how sjw s are just like meathead.
great point
it s not really a moral appeal.  i don t know anyone from that era that actually wanted to be or act like archie.  everyone knew he was an example of what not to be.  that said  offensive topics are just funny.  not sure why  it s just how it is.
let s go 200k!
a man probably
it s not about hurt. it s about entitlement. and now she s a protected class so she can act any way she wants.
@muaythaicoachnimo  is she a protected class for not having a neck once you notice it  you can t unsee it...
ryan hurt her
@michaelbush1374  lol
@meensykw  ryan started the fire
dysfunction breeds more dysfunction.
to bad she never learned that having a good heart can go a long way.
ah i knew i recognized her from somewhere. so its true what melonie said  she s a really woke voice actress and not even she seems to like the show. this show was made for no one.
@optimusck1826  honestly didn t know she was woke  if anything she might not be be but seems like it idk
go team hatred!
i mostly know grey delisle for voicing handmaiden brianna in kotor 2  but now i have another reason to like her.
@dreddpirateroberts  delilah briarwood in the legend of vox machina  among many other roles.
based on conversations i ve had with a friend who is stationed in japan....when anime goes too far for a western audience  it seems like it is an  outlet  of sorts for a repressed version of society over there  i.e. - the dichotomy of love hotels being legal but prostitution isn t legal  being overly sexual in many areas but also extremely conservative in the same areas...
@christophercoates9   well  that makes sense  honestly not surprised since even being part japanese myself even i m just like  for god s sake  get off your high horse you are going to fall
that  together with her white outfit from the last video  god  so beautiful!
the live action movies also gave us a stealth-hot velma in a cat suit.
@marxisdeadandrotting   traffic cone
how dare you! those are classic! classic i say!
@daigon95  the only one i would not swerve to avoid.
the daphne actress in the the dtv sequels was wicked cute.
@marxisdeadandrotting  tru
certified wendy s enjoyer right here
i prefer hot velma over mindy velma
matthew lillard was cool.
@chandlerburse2754  plus that version of shaggy has been the definitive shaggy voice since those movies
@marxisdeadandrotting  don t forget that time that linda cardellini rocked a low cut v neck   in a deleted scene a swimsuit top. so that s echelon stealth hot.
it makes that prequel movie with velma meeting daphne seem awesome  heck the porno parody was more on track with the source material  yeah scooby was a guy in a dog suit  but hey it had a a scooby in it
chandler burse  its more of a rehashing of what jrr tolkien had said in his books about the creation of the orcs. its been revamped to that statement and floated around the internet these last few years. its honestly makes a lot more sense when you look at why all the garbage that comes out in every media and genre based on anything we all once found to be good or of good natured or even neutral.
and that was way funnier and entertaining than whatever this is  and that was a sketch
bu bu but the patriarchy!!!
@3dgar2oh   don t you just love it when they reply with that
exactly! we truly live in a fkn clown world. matter of fact it s more like bizarro world
i met grey delisle a few months back at a convention. she was an absolute sweetheart to meet and gave all the fans hugs.
also she did the same for the character she played on it s always sunny in philadelphia.  as a matter of fact she was basically standing in for glenn howerton in that episode.
not surprised at all that mindy kaling is a horrible person. keep bringing us these great  fun videos  melonie.
i love what you said towards the end that if women want to attract a guy they like to be a pleasant person. i hope many women take your advice on that.
velma was a missed opportunity  but it didn t have to be   every missed opportunity didn t have to be a missed opportunity  that s exactly what it means
starting back at the office  mindy kaling always left me uneasy. it was like coming over to a friend s house and being introduced to their dog  but i m convinced the pet is always on the verge of going full kujo.
linda cardenelli got the character just right   she is adorable and made velma adorable   they are silly movies for very young children but that cast makes it all worth a watch especially cardenelli
all my friends hate that show. one of my black friends literally said it looks like they just used the paint fill  from ms paint to redo her skin.also yes  that s why we don t talk about a certain  redo of a healer   save yourself and don t watch .
when you try too hard to fit in lol. this show is unacceptable and it won t last long. another amazing video mel  have a great rest of your day please!
seeing grey delisle dunk the velma spinoff is just amazing!
i can think of a total of one good thing about this show  it led me to find channels like yours
grey delisle is one of the goats of voice acting.
another awesome video from you  melonie   that last part you stated about how those who are loudest when it comes to virtue signalling are often those who have the accusations brought against them  kinda sounds like a comment i heard on another video by another youtuber who  when discussing how identity politics hurts individuality  ultimately   stated something similar. it was along the lines of  some of the loudest voices that you hear  those that tend to be quickest to virtue signal  tend to underperform in other areas . also  they often don t represent the majority - they are simply the loudest.keep doing your thing  melonie mac! go boom!
the fact that we get to see a second season of this  thanks hbo. stop taking those pills please its messing you up  just fills me with so much unhappy emotions.
this mindy lady must be super well connected  to have so many flops  literally everything shes ever been in charge of  shes got under her belt and the industry keeps tryin to shove her down our throats.....i was gonna make a gross joke...
the fact that kaling can admit that on national television  and face no trial or jail time  and not be canceled  says everything one needs to know about hollywood  if you didn t know already.
worst rated on imdb   looool.  i was looking for the link for that  bottom 100  on their main bottom site navigation but i couldn t find it  they must have taken it off. daphne va throwing more shade than photoshop filters. you are knocking this ongoing story out of the ballpark  melonie
4 00 generally  that kind of content is limited to shows aimed at teenagers in japan. velma is supposedly for adult audiences.
melonie  that stream last night... oh my goodness  that was incredible! when you were talking about the nephilim and were dunking out fact after biblical fact  and then touching on the sick stuff hollywood and the elites are likely into  i was going   yes! yes! yes!! girl  you are on point!! there was a writer  the late jack kelley  who is a favorite of mine for how winsomely he presents the gospel  he had this to say about the nephilim   ... the biblical account is to be taken literally. the phrase  sons of god  refers to disobedient angels  called divine beings in the hebrew translation above  who took on human form and entered into sexual union with human women. their offspring were the nephilim  or fallen ones  of which we speak  huge and powerful beings who may have actually taken over the pre-flood world.according to tradition  in addition to being very large and strong  the nephilim had enormous psychic abilities. they performed out of body experiences  levitation  mind control  time travel  mind reading and remote viewing. they had the power of pronouncing and removing curses and diseases and had ways of knowing and predicting the future. having aligned themselves with satan  the source of their powers  they controlled and enslaved mankind and perverted god s creation almost beyond redemption.they were also extremely intelligent. they knew all about science  architecture  and engineering. some believe they combined these skills with their powers of levitation to build the great pyramid and other great monuments around the pre-flood world. and they weren t just in mesopotamia.  nephilim may have sacrificed human beings all over the planet in temples and pyramids they built in central and south america  the far east  the british isles  egypt and other places. they drank our blood and slaughtered our babies  and were almost certainly tampering with both human and animal gene pools to pervert the creation and make our redemption impossible. they were the heroes of old  the mighty men of renown  memorialized in every mythology  and the primary reason god had to destroy the world and all its inhabitants in the great flood.the facts that the bible describes noah as being perfect in his generations  and that his was the only family saved indicates that noah s bloodline hadn t been contaminated by the genetic tinkering and that his was perhaps the only pure human strain left from which a redeemer could come.  gen. 6 9  if so  it explains why the entire world population had to be destroyed  lest noah s line eventually be contaminated  too. the things you were saying last night are backed up by a writer who was as sound and winsome as jack kelley was. you were touching on some of these very things last night!melonie  i absolutely mean it when i say you are a fantastic pillar of salt and light for god s kingdom. you re speaking on subjects that many churches are afraid to even discuss nowadays! so many churches have fallen to the woke progressive mindset that they ve become ineffective and lukewarm. a condition jesus warns against becoming.but you aren t lukewarm! you re doing what so many others are not  standing up for truth and exposing darkness and lies.so i just wanted to be sure to tell you how fantastic last night s stream was. you were spiritually on fire  and it was such a blessing to listen to! i can t help but hope that maybe  in the future  you might consider making a go boom! video providing an in-depth discussion on the nephilim. it may not get as many views as your entertainment-focused vids  but i think it could become one of the most spiritually important vids you could make.thanks a ton for last night s stream
stumbled across your contact and i m thoroughly enjoying it!! keep it up!
is it   de-lyle  or  de-leel   hell  is it  de-liz-lee
@themightyfiction8792  i ve always pronounced it the first way.  i could be wrong with ms. delisle  though.
@themightyfiction8792  it s de-lyle.  or you could always call her by her married name   griffin.  either will suffice.  she goes by both and even hyphenated.  so yeah  she don t care.
was so happy that only lasted an episode lol
bro its a man mtf they call it hijra in india ... oh so much to teach and so litlle time !
yeah i can t believe she had the nerve to call the golden god basic.
that episode was awful. i m so glad dennis came back at the very end and told her to take a hike.
@user-ub8nk5cc1l  please explain kind sir lol
mindy kaling  overweight salty chick resorting to self insert. jessica gao  writer of she-hulk show  overwright salty chick resorting to self insert. seeing a pattern here lol
oh  mindy s just a big nanny dog!
already getting a season 2
@theveryworstluck1894  yeah i heard unfortunately but with it s ratings it ll die quickly.
people keep hate watching  which is driving up the viewer numbers.
@eddiejravannen  that s why i wait for pirated versions  hate watching done right. i just rely on people like melonie  critical drinker  moist critical etc to expose them until then.
@batman0  same here  i ll watch people review it  heels vs babyface is my go-to  but i won t even watch a pirated version of this junk.
dang  long comment lol. but it s all fact.
ahh man  i wish i was not too busy to have seen that last night. taking care of errands. sounds right up my alley  i ll have to rewatch the replay later this week
chandler burse  i think people don t realise that the egyptians were apart of the dynastic period and had access to bronze tools  that would make shaping both granite and limestone extremely easy. infact the straight edges on the stones that people claim is impossible to achieve without  lasers  was done with a large  two man bronze toothless saw that used water and sand grit to cut. i ve seen it done and tested it myself  even gone as far as testing limestone polishing with quartz which is rated on the same mohs scale as granite.as for moving the blocks  that was done with counter balancing. you can t lift a 1 ton stone but you can lift 10 100kg ones separately to counter it.edit  sorry dude  egyptian stuff gets me going haha
interesting topic. every last one of them is either an invert or a nephilim. it gets extremely obvious after you practice your  they live  glasses.
i am a white male and i have been in this situation 3 times in my life and i always told myself it was because i was wasted and it was on me because they were sober  because i felt that way i never felt i could talk to a single soul about it.as time goes on though it just makes me feel worse but its good to get it out there anywhere  even if no one ever reads this.
grey delisle is a gem.
daphne is with us
velma should be in the history books for bringing everyone together
someone needs to tell mindy that ryan was just a character in a tv show
i couldn t care less about what message the creators and cast of velma have to say  and what they think about their own show. what i do want to hear are the perspectives of the former scooby-doo creators and casts  and what they think of this ip that has been warped so dramatically. if only casey kasem were here to see what has happened to poor shaggy.
notably  the man she kissed is lee pace  and from what i know about him he and mindy have incompatible hardware  so really it s not only a metoo thing but also an alphabet thing.
got to say a big congratulations to the developers and creaters of the da hne show on thier success at having the worst rated show ever
despite velma being garbage  this actually given me hope for the future. people of various backgrounds  beliefs  and ideologies coming together in agreement in how horrible this show is. in a twisted way i m glad this show exists.
haven t watched the show  but have seen a few critical videos of it  and holy        does it do everything it can to be hateable.
well it was always a red flag when none of the previous voice actors agreed or were approached to play their iconic roles from the successful franchises. even when recasting with the existing ip they at least tried to connect it with the past by having part of the cast stay as anchors and introduce the replacements where they needed  very rarely a full complete recast and redesign has been fruitful  usually when the previous cast and design majorly flopped and costed studio money and reputation
i hate that argument. this is not colorblind casting! in  colorblind casting  you are selecting the best people for the role with the best overall chemistry together in the ensemble. everyone compliments everyone else and brings out the best in each other. this shouldn t be difficult to accomplish  a perfect example of this done right was all the way back in 1999 cinderella starring brandi.   it s a beloved musical where the audience can easily suspend their disbelief in cinderella and that s for several reasons  the biggest one being the most important  besides genuine talent  which the cast had in spades  chemistry!bernadette peters for example is perfect as the step-sister s mother  their interactions on screen are highly believable.  and not just because it s easy to assume she married a black guy and one daughter looked like her while the younger one reflected her father. though i m sure that doesn t hurt. a better example is probably the king and queen with their filipino son. admittedly as much as i dislike whoopi  or rather what she has become  she too was believable as the prince s mom again  as was the very white king. again these people looked nothing alike  but we get so pulled into the story our brains tune out the mismatch and we are able to focus on the very enjoyable product.  what hollywood is doing today is not remotely the same  there is no heart  soul or even love in these projects  the  color  is simply calculated and cynical for the sake of checking boxes.
they got the adult part right !!
there s a reason mindy can t get a white guy in spite of clearly repressing her lusting after them. certain women put off a  metoo  vibe. as in  it s all sunshine and daisies  until you flip one of her switches and then everything you ve ever done together gets the consent revoked and you end up getting accused of all sorts of travesties. guys have been forced fairly rapidly over the past decade and a half to develop the ability to read this vibe  it s a necessity in today s age when you can have your life ruined in seconds just for having the  wrong opinion.  but white guys tend to be over-sensitive to this vibe because there s no safety net for white guys  they re like the one demographic that s okay to hate on in every environment  so whereas for most guys mindy is a red flag  for white guys she s defcon 1 alarms.
grey delisle also voiced jaqueline natla in both tomb raider anniversary and tomb raider underworld.  _
wow ! on point as usual melonie !!! i never ever made the connection that her office character was just her being herself! great observation! poor hr tobey would be beside himself knowing her real life antics are 100 times worse then micheal scott s scripted reality !!! when i saw this story about her awhile back i knew you d be all over it and lois lane tha  crap out of it !!!! you need to make some freakin decoder rings so we can super-friend support you   lol. thanks for your dedication.  you are always in my prayers
mindy grew up with rich parents  never worked a day job   was handed a hollywood job through her parents contracts   influences. so when she wrote fred as a spoiled rich kid with no soul. yeah i can definitely see she s really writing herself. this is what we in the business call  the projection    a classic freudian slip.
it s not color-blind. every color of each character was very carefully selected. we re talking about potentially long conversations in the writing room about the choice of skin color for each character.
hey melonie! wow really  that s interesting. velma is so bad. and disparu does a great job. you look amazing melonie
no wonder mindy kaling didn t mature enough in high school or college
contact me for your reward
i got the reward. it s fromunda
you should be blocking these accounts  mel.
@megakazuya123  wym
@megakazuya123  why would melonie block my account
@therealstephentv  i don t want to use the word obsessed  but you freakin love melanie. you talk about her constantly on twitter and youtube.
@jwonder4858  lol so what melonie is just a cool lady and no one is being creepy at all   so i don t understand what the problem is there is nothing wrong with being a fan i kind of talk about her on my twitter alot too but idc cause i respect tf out of that woman idc how some random dude on youtube feels about it i m just a fan of melonie mac  that s all i care about
fun fact  grey delisle voiced jeanne in the bayonetta games and natla in tomb raider anniversary . she has also voiced catwoman as well so she is a full supporter of sexy female lead franchises which woke people despise so wouldn t consider her part of that bat shit crazy crowd.
i ve never known melonie to be a wine-r but she does talk about grapes a fair bit in this video probably not a good thing
so if this show is a self-insert. this means mindy kaling not so secretly wants to be a serial murderer lol
people like mindy keep putting their trash on streaming sites instead of the garbage and then get upset they say it stinks
7 22 can you imagine what would happen to a guy if he did that  the double standard of these freaks knows no bounds.
actually   velma  might be a parody of wokeness. for example   velma  has the hots for  fred  even though he s a  privileged  white guy and a  pig-headed  male. this tracks with feminists. they hate on such men publicly  but then they turn around and show physical interest in them. also   velma  gives him a feminist book to read. he does and it brainwashes him to be a male feminist. and what happens when he becomes one   velma  loses interest in him emotionally and rejects him. again  this tracks with reality. female feminists reject male feminists all the time  and continue to lust after the chad dude-bros.i think this is why the wokies don t like the show either  because it s actually mocking them.
every once in awhile  the internet proves its  ability to bring people together.  it s like water finding it s own level.   now  if we could all just get together on some of the far more important issues confronting us  that d be great!!thanks for the content.stay up  stay free!!
it s kinda like wil wheaton who is playing himself as a bad person on the big bang and he is in sense doing the same person in felicia days the guild. here comes my point  he isn t playing mean he s just a bad person  both in television and real life. it s kinda sad that a guy like him was in star trek and in sense a show that talks about tolerance and respect of others isn t living by that code himself.
anyone can make a hated series. it takes talent to create a series that gets the normies and the wokies to unite and go after it.
lol  i feel bad for melonie using so many code words in this. basically she could have held up a purple nehi soda during half the velma descriptions and pointed at it.
watched reruns of star blazers in the early 80 s as a kid  amazing. the next anime i remember watching was ninja scroll in the mid late 90 s  violent af. some of it gets about as dark as it gets.
i love disparu...such classic gentleman.
knowing this gets a second season is a massive win for terrible woke media
jinkies!both to the story here and the fact you hit 110 000 subscribers. congrats!
once upon a time grey delisle used to make fun of sjws on tumblr
great video! keep doing what you do!
idt i ve ever seen a show bring both sides together in unified hatred lmfao. mindy should be applauded for doing something we all found impossible.
when a show rates lower than high guardian spice  you know you messed up. 1.4  hgs  vs 1.3  velma  out of ten.
110k subs for melonie! woohoo!
the hair looks great today with the extra volume!  have an excellent day
hello gorgeous great video nice to see  people calling this stuff out
if people can relate to velma.. they need to take a serious look at themselves in a mirror.
i keep saying this. . . this is literally the quality of a tumblr fan-fic.  it even includes all the self inserting as the hero and the romantic interest of long standing characters.  like her lesbo relations with daphne.  this is tumblr shit.
terrible and disgusting show to be sure  but watching you and disparu dunking on it has been fine entertainment.
many people ve said that this was likely a show that hbo wb wouldn t green light without a familiar ip attached to it. i wonder if the original show s name was  mindy .
when you say grape in this context  my mind instantly goes to the whitest kids you know skit  grapist  and i can t stop laughing.
7 10 a co-star she even hired herself  if i remember correctly.
i love that on this channel i keep learning new words  grape  corn  etc.
also there is a trope in anime where the character is  achtually 400 year old elder dragon gawd blah blah blah . in velma it s literally young people
oh  absolutely  anime can get really warped and disturbing by most anybody s standards--the first season of  tokyo ghoul  alone is not for the faint of heart. but it tempers that horror with human drama and the classic question of who is more human  the ghouls or the men who hunt them  on point  grey delisle-griffin may be woke  i have no idea  but i agree with you that she likely is because hollyweird   but she has every right as a va for daphne to call things as she sees them. good on her  either way. i m not surprised that this show is bombing and it has it coming. oh  and to touch on what you spoke of at the end  all the people accusing vic mignogna were way sketchier than him  but yet a bunch of salty millennial sjw s still spread a bunch of baseless rumors about him being a  con creep  without any real evidence because he s famous and made something of himself unlike they ever did. if he s so awful  where s the evidence  nuff sed.
is that a mini g-fuel refrigerator you have plugged up in the background   awesome!also i like how your channel is actually you making your videos from home  and not some big company paying you to pretend.
you re right. i ve met gorgeous women who  like mindy  turned me off instantly through their atrocious personalities.
also  how long do we have to wait to start treating mindy like cosby
moderen tv be like   its ok if a woman does it
i still don t know anything about this tv series and i ll keep it that way  i like this rock i m living under
mindy is a terrible person in real life  i m shocked.........shocked i say......
now for the rest of ms. delisle s castmates to grace us with a group critique of this new thing...it seems to me that the critiques from the older heads in the ip  seem to hurt these remake creators  egos the most.  as they should when the later material so blatantly - even proudly - works to upend all the built-in goodwill of the franchise.
grey delisle keeps winning!
why are there naked ppl in a scooby doo cartoon....wtf
thank you so much
she has to say that otherwise youtube will definitely demonetize the video
this is what happens when there is no baseline for moral values and people just make them up out of convenience.
the best sign of how much this show sucks is that even the woke media and celebrities have to at least admit it.
melonie is mid-winter purple pink hallmark boom.
maybe this is truly an original story of the original cast.the adversity makes fred a strong leader. velma gets decked in the face and loses her eyesight. shaggy learned to never trust women ever again and gets a dog.
im a black guy and i absolutely love red heads  i don t see what skin color has to do with who you re attracted to or likes. i just cant wrap my mind around these folks and one key reason i rarely watch movies shows made in the west any more just a bunch of bs and bitterness in the shows if not str8 propaganda and forced activism.
the sad part is   mindy is very talented but lost in a self-induced woke culture prison.
azula brought enough marshmallows and aloe vera for everyone   all the burns and roasting.
so mindy got  thirsty  once
firstly  i want to thank you for introducing me to magnesium glycinate. i ve recommended it to my family   now we re all getting a better night s sleep while working towards staying fit   lean. i ve had a noticeable gut for 8 years   even though i exercise frequently  i don t think i would have gotten rid of it without watching your videos.i ve been subscribed to your new channel since you started it  but i m not so sure anymore. i know you banned my account  backup368  by clicking  hide user from channel     it s because i didn t agree with you about tomb raider. all my comments on your channel disappeared  nobody can see them. i have been very vocal about this youtube feature for a while  because it only provides security blankets for corporations whenever they face public criticism. you retweeted a post that says  no one deserves to be silenced   banned   but you don t mean this. don t lie to us and tell us censorship is a problem   then add to that problem. we don t need to agree 100  of the time. i like to listen to debates as well as partake in them  but i never silence critics. they have a seat at the table just like anyone else. if you can t  practice what you preach   you re not a genuine person. you re no different from lrg.i m not asking to make amends or un-ban me. you have your reasons   it was no mistake. but what your fans would appreciate is for you to be transparent on your real take on tech censorship. if you have censored or will censor others    they also find out   spread stories online  your fans are likely going to lose your trust. many influencers like angry joe   matt jarbo learned the hard way about trying to keep secrets. luckily  you have time to not repeat them.
can we please put the word  manizer  in the dictionary  when it comes to vel- i mean  mindy kaling
they should just create their own woke characters  probably still wont be successful but wouldn t have double backlash  unless their goal is to destroy these well known characters
if people constantly have to tell you how great  nice  not racist and sexist they are they probably just want to repeat it as much as possible to convince themselves that its true.
imagine if he did that to her   thats her problem....... they dont want to...
i remember grey delisle more as yumi from hi hi puffy amiyumi and mandy from the grim adventures
please don t drug me  mindy.
it s a sign of how far we ve collapsed that a person could get sued for stealing a kiss... i think dick the butcher had the right idea.
mindy just inserted herself into the cartoon. with all her habits and toxic attitude and sees nothing wrong with characters  especially velma  the lead of the show. which has never been done before. even when it was just her shaggy  and scobie.  it was still scooby doo. the only way it possibly could ve been worse was to make scoobs into her house cat. changing the one person who did drugs now a black person and the one person who knew karate turned into a asian ethnicity. i find that racist all day. i m not gonna touch on fred because we already knew how they were gonna do him
great video as usual
min s attractive ! the manosphere is lighting up!!
we originally thought she was joking about the firing. but  guess she wasn t.
@ravimeena7280  cha cha cha
@user-sj2gj5nw1r
mindy kaling would make a great live action shrek
velma makes the rings of power look good. although that might be pushing it.   bro it s not that hard to be a good writer. but it s like these people are living in a sperate reality than they are. rich people are sus.
seeing this makes me feel like scrappy doo got way too much hate back in the day.
wow. jumping forward to kiss some one when a moment is obviously not happening is repulsive. i have had more aggressive experiences with out of control women not understanding that  no  was me being polite and it is not appreciated. it did help make me the insufferable and outspoken a  hole i am today though so... wasn t that bad in retrospect since it lead to personal growth.
it s springtime for velma  and germany.
are all the episodes even out yet for the show
isn t that lee pace  what project was he working on with mindi
every character she plays is a self-insert to me that means you have no talent but hollywood says you re pretty talented just to play yourself what the fudge
i grew up in a 2x4 room with nothing in the depths of brooklyn  all i had was family so i was rich with love  but never once did i blame anyone else  woke people are so devoid of reality.
they call it  colourblind casting  but all they talk about is colour.
thanks for the video. the cartoon was called scooby doo for a reason. i remember eating frosted flakes watching scob and shaggy  and  then the flintstones good times.
not trying to simp melanie but your hair looks amazing here
we can laugh but just remember this  they won t lose money over this. that s the thing about streaming services - unless we start unsubbing from these big tech   hollywood streaming services en masse they can keep doing this. their bottom line won t be affected - people don t need to watch these shows for them to keep making revenue since it s included in an overall package. if you really want to impact them financially  unsub from your netflix amazon disney hulu etc.
everything that mindy has been doing lately is all just for attention  that s all she cares about. it s much easier to get attention to make loved content into this garbage. she knows that doing this will get headlines without having to do a good job.
always complain about body positivity in exactly beautiful who they are yet they are out of control when it comes to someone attractive and sexy they are more sex crazy than they point out man to be
we ve really got to see what peoples  true colors  are nowadays. you see someone that s never really had a problem with people  all of a sudden have so much to say. people will say anything to try and stay relevant on some temporary situations
before this show even got released  i saw a bunch of clips where a variety of characters in this show were talking about fred s dick. that told me everything i needed to know in regards to watching it  namely  that i shouldn t.now  realizing that mindy used velma as a self insert to hook up with high school girls creeps me out badly. gotta love the people claiming that she s a conservative too  because the right is known for playing identity politics this hard.
twitter puritans and hollywood and comic book writers attack anime girls but when scooby-doo doo characters are serialized they say nothing  hypocrisy!!!!!!!
the pnly chance for this show is for ultra instinct shaggy to show up and actually go ultra instinct!
anyone else get the  gordon ramsay teaches you how to make the perfect burger at home  ad and watch the whole thing  me too.
better story and storytelling than four episodes of velma .
speaking of anime  the film that time i got reincarnated as a slime is fun.
you re not wrong about the anime point  there s a few animes that are  to me  too gross for their own good. but for every gross anime  2-3 wholesome ones pop up.
it looks like those were two different writers for that publication
it is almost as if allowing women to co-opt your ip is a bad idea....
wait the show is actually called velma  it s not scoobi do
dude. simple. there s a big difference between japanese anime and american cartoons.most american cartoons are generally  past and present  made for kids and teens.japanese anime is generally made for everyone in japanese culture. it s practically a movie industry. you can find adult theme anime  teenage themes  children s themes  etc.
velma  the m-rated scooby-doo show features underaged teens flaunting sexuality   consistent racism  and writing so cringy that shakespearehemmingway s garfield stories seem like 20th century s greatest masterpieces in comparison.
will all the  grape  going on  would this be considered the  catalina wine mixer
oh yeah  as an anime fan i have to say anime can be way worse. even as an adult i still look up parent s guides if i pick something new to watch  because no other media seems to have the ability to blindside you like anime can. i ve noped out of my fair share of shows one or two episodes in  and i don t think that s as common with american media.
where can i find the original conan interview of mindy
excuse my french  but i find your eyes incredibly gorgeous and hypnotic.
lol saying  anime can sometimes be creepy and gross  is the least controversial statement you could ever make lol.
i like your side-part hair style.  looks good.
let me hear about just one elderly womans funeral  and i ll try to re-apply for social security while applying for jobs online which the applications are already going out into the internet clouds...
if real life was an old scooby-doo episode  the scooby gang  would run through a series of doors . yummy yummy   yummy i got love in my tummy and i feel like loving you.. wait gang there s a monster in  our trap! it s mindy kaling!  fred would say    no it s just a mindy mask. let s see who the kissing bandit really is!   jinkies  it s old man harvey weinstein! ...... and i would have gotten away with it too if i had been a woke woman of color!
melonie  velma is the worst rated animated show in imdb history...me  it s also been picked up for a second season.
she just admits to sa and everyone laughs it off wtf
nice needler in the background  pink  spiky and makes things go boom  seems quite appropriate for you. keep up with the good videos
shes a self insert character
i am not a fan of how mindy portrays velma...simple as that. the way the character was wrote reminds me of a friend that i kept my distance from  i would avoid her. i don t wanna watch a show of someone that i want to avoid.
appreciate your support towards my channel contact me for your reward
what made shows and video games is gone  not been genuinely hyped in a really long time i hate it. many studios playing it safe and too many dang reboots   remakes but thankfully indie devs coming in clutch.for velma  i don t need old va s or even scooby just want something you know entertaining is all!
i did enjoy the scoob! movie.
beautiful sweater melanie
date grape lol youtube rules aren t great for many things but date grape reminds me of back in the day when r rated movies were on tv and they had to substitute curse words and they would get dubbed over with ridiculous things. this wasn t a funny topic but it still made me laugh lol
the true test on wokeness is can you insert any other color  race  religion or sexuality into their statements and it still stand up  almost exclusively you can say no. the statements would never be socially acceptable due to the fact its bigoted  racist etc. etc..
imagine having to ruin a faithful fun show to a small demographic to piss us off then it goes horrible in ratings makes me happy lol
that mindy person is very weird .. btw the color swap in this series is so weird and in your face velma reminds me to rachel dolezal
for the anime no shit  but manga makes more sense to me  it makes more sense  now yes. sometimes the anime is just as good as the manga  that s just my opinion.
you know mindy s brother pretended to be black to get into med school
i m so glad i will never will watch this. grey delisle is an amazing voice actress. hundreds of different characters. mindy is not a good person from everything i have seen. keeping you in prayers   melonie. not that it matters  and obviously personal taste  but you are at least as pretty as mindy.
i just think there s too much shade thrown on the actors and not enough on the script writers who created the ish to begin with.
i was wondering who daphne virginia is.
it is interesting how a show managed to bring together woke people and the more conservative side of twitter to hate on the same thing.
somehow it became heavily demanded. i wonder why.... oh wait....it s those trolls. they always take what we love and force us to deal with it.
you look really good in grey cloth. nice video.
if hbo max wanted to make velma an adult-oriented horror-comedy series  then they needed to take them out of high school  stop being perverts   and take the mystery team into the young adult view  and stop being woke.  woke-ism is a religion  and it is about being rebels  and they are incoherent on anything  worshiping eris  the goddess of chaos and the daughter of nix  is interesting  but her cave is nothing but darkness  not even zeus goes there    you cannot make a deal with the anarchist mob of woke-ism  don t even attempt to please them  because it is a dumpster fire that they leave you in.  hbo max also needed to rename velma  maybe the mystery machine team  confidential.  this is  because  like the movie channels  the soft adult stuff needs to seem to be private  thus confidential  you know  for your eyes only  a james bond movie and song.  admittedly  cartoon stuff like this isn t the most popular in the united states  because the culture has been conditioned to leave cartoons for underage children  it is why japanese anime is treated differently  because they have a different culture for their point of view that is much more acceptable for mature cartoon work  they don t have the guilt  and they are more clear about it.  i m open minded about many things  but adult cartoons appear strange to me as well  and hbo max should go to live action for the confidential report.  finally  i ve read a comment here on the melonie mac go boom site that velma is so woke that it appears as an act of sabotage against the woke-ism.  this is really them  they don t like their reality in the reflection  they are a bunch of punks without the music talent.
if it was such a  colorblind casting  why do they need to remind you at every opportunity of the colors of the colorblind cast
velma also repeatedly attacks  hot girls  so mindy hates you too for stealing her white men from her.
yes another melonie mac video ur looking beautiful as always sis
it doesn t matter what the characters look like this is a steaming pile of scooby doo doo just from the plot alone
@meloniemacgoboom found a fake bot using ur name again
there is actually an indie fan made live action series here on youtube that is 100 times better than velma.
every time i look at mindy my outtie becomes an innie and i m asian so i have to use tweezers to get it out.
looking good melonie. hope you know i ain t no simp tho
mindy needs the stunner were is stone cold when you need him
i feel like the most privileged people like mindy here.. don t deserve any nice things.. she should have everything being taken away.. mindy is quite pathetic for messing up one of the most beloved series ever..
looking good melonie
and it is getting a second season.
melonie mac go boom is correct.  mindy kaling was obviously miscast  and she made velma appear wicked.  velma has sass  and they are always critical comments  that is used to reveal her intellect  but she isn t a wicked woman.
wait  thats d voice actress for azula from avatar d last airbender.... cool
she didn t force herself on that guy... she stole a kiss. rude  yes. sexual assault  no.i wonder what my brother would think  when i was little  he used to advise me   if you kiss a girl  and she slaps you  what do you do  me   knock her on her ass so she knows she can t hit you just for giving her a kiss .my brother  taken aback    no... you kiss her again to show her it was worth it and that brother could get just about any women he wanted.  ended up marrying an ugly little shrew .
shesh  imagine your show just getting dunked on like that. i just wanna be a fly on the wall on the team that made this travesty.it s ironic that this show thinks it s critics are racist meanwhile the show itself is racist as hell.
i think mindy kaling is fucking nuts!!!
of course she did it ruined what made scooby doo popular in the first place.they made shaggy black and a simp for velma which isn t shaggy at all. shaggy isn t even interested in dating girls he s more interested in eating food with his dog and hanging out with his friends. velma isn t toxic or make fun of white people or laugh at people who has a crush on her. she s smart and loves her friends equally. fred isn t some useless dude who can t take care of himself. he s is the driver of the mystery machine  sets up traps and a chick magnetic. as for daphne well i don t know but i do know that daphne isn t gay or bisexual  she s a rich straight woman who loves fred.
1 - she likes white guys but only the very attractive ones.2 - she can t get a relationship from those chads. 3 - she is mad and frustrated so she proceeds to completely destroy a piece of art called scooby doo.
this is unrelated to the loud virtue signalers  but i have a feeling that many of the accusations against these male feminists occur not because of them actually doing something bad but because they re trying to date feminists.
welcome to 2023 where daphne is a crack  who are you....use your imagination  shaggy is a complete dumpster fire and velma  which i m not going to lie she used to give me a geek mhm  into a sociopath and fred is the only redeeming thing in this entire show thank you  hbo  for ruining 54 years of an awesome cartoon  thank you for showing your viewers that you belong on the curb with every other wasted potential
after seeing that clip and imagining if the genders were reversed  it begs the question  do men need a hashtag now calling out these women for their sexual harrassment   himtoo  etiam
the big difference between anime and this knock off scooby-doo spin off is that scooby-doo was always produced for children until this disasterous shit show!! just think about how many kids probably watched this smut and their parents seeing that it s just a scooby-doo knock off probably never in their wildest nightmares would ve imagined that their kids are watching a groomer s version of scooby-doo.i couldn t imagine walking into my little boys  room  when they were still little  that is   and seeing that shower scene and heard what was being said. i d have lost my flipping mind and burned down the world around everyone involved in the production of this grooming material.
i like the outro song btw!
i had completely no interest on seeing this series once.iseen the trailer to it i said nothanks lol.thanks melonie foralways bringing these topics to life.
i ve been saying this for years. not being racist is the new racism.however this show is just classic racism.
tbh  from what i get  this series works to woke twitter culture as starship troopers works for fascism  it is a parody in disguise  ultimately exaggerating the absurd and nonsense of those movements.
just goes to prove once again...get woke  go broke!
does anyone actually think mindy s finished  after this  for all the talk of male white privilege  she s a hollywood celebrity who can make one of the biggest flops in the history of cinema and still have a job  afterwards. the majority of people  if they screwed up on their job  would be fired. she will probably get a promotion. they have no right to talk about privilege when they re practically royalty with how privileged they are.
you want it all  but you can t have it! it s in your face but you can t grab it!! what is it   can t say it!!!
i love the cope from the woke that the show is actually a right wing psyop
it s worst than dragon ball evolution. that means a lot.
i do no virtue signaling. i must be a f     saint irl.
sorry  but the argument that you re racist because you re more attracted to one race than another is as stupid as calling you transphobic because you re only attracted to real women  or real men .
i m just sad that seth rogan and sarah silverman s santa show got knocked down from worst show ever made.
meat canyon made a better adaptation then velma
fine  great  we know. can we now please turn your attention to addressing the activists campaign to change the rt audience score for the god-awful woke willow tv series this show was universally voted 23  audience score on rt and activist twitter campaigns have raised it all the way to 60  for it s lgbtq  representation only. it s an activist campaign and it s not even subtle.the series itself is very poor quality and does not meet the basic minimum standards for  writing  acting or direction  and completely spits all over the fanbase. help!
so when will mindy rip on ultra instinct shaggy   norville
any form of media can have its creepy works. still frames  animation  live action  music  literature. no country is infallable either. however  i don t like the hypocrisy of hating  loli  which is a body type and not an age  while praising velma which has admitted teenagers being naked and a weird fixation on fred s dong. there has been a long-standing backlash against superheroes who don t kill. sorry  snyder fans. the movies were fun  the killing was stupid and usually pointless. there has been many arguments of  well  if i was a superhero who could kill bad guys  i would.  like that is a justification of trying to force the comic book writers to make the main heroes kill  and not on their sociopathic nature coming out. and they have offshoot universes of the heroes who do kill. there is a whole hour video where the guy talks about if superman is needed in our modern age. with some critics  men and women  mocking superman for not killing in the main universe  when again other universes have shown what happens when he kills  when batman kills  and so on.with all this  i don t totally blame mindy for this all. wb  run by zaslav  let this go through! fuck shows and movies that were already done! batgirl  who was a dark skinned woman  got cancelled after 90  finished! which many people called zaslav everything from  democrat in name only  to nyahtzee. cancelled a mostly done scoob 2  sequel to the cg movie. but then he allows things like ezra miller to stay as flash  even when the movie wasn t that much done  and there are rumors of him paying for a flash commercial at the superbowl  something wb hasn t done in years  even with the bigger heroes. and this abomination of an adaptation. what was he thinking there ! another rumor was that he could be looking at  if velma tanks so hard  he wouldn t have to spend money on more scooby doo stuff in the future  but still hold the ip. or make a new scooby doo thing that  because people hated velma so much  people will rush to whatever comes out that is slightly more faithful. it worked with ghostbusters after all.because of velma  i wouldn t be surprised if people look at things like netflix s cowboy bepob and paramount s halo and say   i think i was too harsh on you.
franco played  a really good looking guy  his @   should have won an oscar for that role.
melonie  all grey did was note the fact that the show isn t doing well. that s it. your response isn t proportionate. also  anime is fundamentally sexist on a frequent basis  and definitely sexualizes teenagers at times. japan is notably obsessed with sex  and bodily waste  culturally. i can cite examples!
velma is the best show. you all are just haters and bandwagoners. if you can t see the humor and coolness of velma  then you squares are starting to become the problem.
bloody hell. subbed for the accent
swore off most anime because of how problematic most of it can get. honestly do not understand how people tolerate these disgusting trends to the point they have infected so many popular media   also similar stuff has popped up regarding some of the fire emblem engage support dialogues which were changed for the western release  would be interested to hear your thoughts
a bunch of grapes in this video. remember to drink water with that. hahaha
agreed
i forgot to add this with regards to the last few seconds of your video! vic mignona  voice actor for many anime. been in many fan films because he enjoys helping people out. nice guy who won t let anyone on a line to meet him not get at least a word with him  even after the alotted time was up. was rumored of committing  sa  just because he is a christian  and people love beating the dead horse of christians and children. he was fired   let go  bs  from many shows projects because of the rumor. how was the rumor started though  other prominent voice actors  who felt they weren t as popular as vic  would  slip information  here and there. he s never been arrested and has sued for defamation and the like  even repealed a few times but the judges usually wouldn t let evidence be admitted. sounding a little like johnny depp amber heard case  huh  but wait! there s one big kicker similarity between the two! one of the accuser voice actors  has been investigated for sa of minors! i don t know if there were charges filed dropped  or a court case  but i haven t heard more yet. the accuser  allegedly   only because not convicted yet  doing exactly what they accused someone innocent of doing to ruin him. hmm! vic is starting to bounce back though.i just wanted to add another case of  virtue signaling wokesters doing what they accuse others of doing.
problematic how
@raifseverence  your best bet is to ignore anyone who says  problematic .
@bretling5805   disclaimers   i am not responsible  liable  culpable  etc. for anything.  if you think i am giving advice  don t take it. if you take anything you construe as my advice  see above. think you should change your channel description there or otherwise stop giving awful advice  mate.
well  as to your general commenting on anime... your not wrong. anime  depending on the type  is oftentimes  overdoing  it in terms of over-se ualization.at least when you talk to a certain portion of u.s. population. and the thing is this - it s fine. no one needs to have the same view on things or has tolike the same things. when it for example comes to violence and erotic depictions in modern media  the u.s. and europe are oftentimes a polar opposite.but the thing is this  anime are for the most part asian productions  primarily for asian audiences. naturally  the international audiences have greatly grown in the last 20 years  but it s still a fact. and usually  and hopefully  the asian artists don t let themselves be  corrupted  by western modern views on their art.and i m very glad that they don t. so that i in the future still have the actual choice of what type of anime and manga i want  or don t want to consume without being restricted by western censorship...
when was the last time you have watched entertainment when you wanted to and what was it  i havent even been interested in watching anything in years.
in velma she tried to make her personal fantasy real by making fred a white guy to simp for her because of her brain and confidence and she rejects him ..she wishes
scoobie is now a teen girl now to...like wtf
hi melonie! good afternoon. hope you re having a great day. you look incredibly cute.
@melonie mac go boompretty sure that grey isn t woke.  she probably has pronouns on her account because she s required to for work.
mindi kaling---   i didnt make this show for the fans..  ..no shit lady... no shit...
if they wanted an m rated velma have scooby be a son of the original scooby a scooby that is hilarious like his father but braver more like a dog that would attack a dude to save others kind heck a trained dog scoobys son
the daphne thumbnail looks like peggy bundy. don t know who peggy is look her up.
this is what happens when you take a dump on the source material so big that it s coming back up in their faces.
i really think  that people don t understand how to be natural  anymore   i see it in people i meet in real life.
just who in hell is this show made for   is there some kind of competition among the writers to see who could turn out the worst trash ever. and just who actually green lite this project.
those men don t want her not because of the color of her skin but the lack of content in her character.
i wish that when you did these videos you could m instead of maximizing your browser you could let it take up 2 3ds of rhe screen and zoom in a bit  ctrl and mouse wheel      it would be fun to be able to read some comments and stuff you arent mentioning
wow! dont isnult rule 34 artists and fan fic writer like that!
the original dragonball series had some very  uncomfortable  moments. def not for kids!
belma. black velma. mindy kahling has lighter skin.
if....no. men have been canceled and gone to jail for what mindy has done.recall   meetoo
sword art online is a good example of a creepy anime
oh god. every time melonie says  she s pretty  i threw up in my mouth. mindy could only be considered pretty if she was back under her bridge with the rest of the trolls.
contact me for your reward
chandler burse  you might be right  but idk  think very few of us are and the ones who are not are trying to match what everyone else is doing  and tell you your wrong for not doing what they are.
hello from brazil. please don t cut the text. i like to read with you to practice the language.
all true!
lets gooooo
the writer has issues with tv and is not the normal writer.  i watched an efap on alanah pearce irl channel.  she is a professional writer currently employed and santa monica studios.
if the casting was  colorblind  then why is it such an important aspect of the show for the writers and critics  they constantly bring up the diversity of the cast characters  as if it was the most important aspect of the cast characters. add unto this that each voice actor is the same ethnicity of the character they are voicing.......
9 15 mindy weinstein
it s really sad how you were stating regardless of race what happened to personal choice what if somebody doesn t want someone of a certain race..
apparently this show was rated m for manure...
that mindy woman should have just named this show   the mindy show   w naked kids ...
oh yes....go watch twin dolls 2 and tell me you were comfortable lol
wow! yeah big disappointment in mindy. i have had the hugest crush on her. too bad
edit  bravo to grey delisle-griffin for calling mindy kaling out on this miserable excuse for a cartoon.
the latest product from mindy groomation llc.
throwing shade  there s already too much shade in the show.
she reminds me of a horrible man hating bully of a hyper feminist at uni  who i later saw had found herself a boyfriend. i found it ironic that despite seemingly hating men she found herself the most masculine guy i have ever seen.
btw mindy is pretty much frolo from the hunchback of notre dame. almost  she lacks his sophistication.
jesaja 5 20 woe unto them that call evil good  and good evil  that put darkness for light  and light for darkness  that put bitter for sweet  and sweet for bitter!
currently waiting on dragon ball z to get the woke treatment.
azusa burned velma
honestly  i don t see the problem with the sitcom joke. did she say people can t make the same joke  but with the genders reversed  cause if she didn t  then it wouldn t be hypocritical.
so she has snow fever then
so  true   sis
i would watch anime  but i m a grown man that s straight   into adult women!
did anyone else notice that in avatar 2 that some of the underwater scenes of the youths featured some female nipple exposures  what s up with hollywood and including this kind of crap in their productions
forbidden white chocolate !
i like it
my pro nouns are fluff and floof
that s cool and all but grey delisle is actually worse than mindy kaling. seems like she s just vindictive that she didn t get a part on the show. grey openly advocates for the cancelling of any actor who doesn t fall in line with wokeness  has pronouns in bio  etc. she s seriously awful.
at least velma gave our beloved content creators more topics to monetize. thanks  velma!go away now!
i want to watch it but i don t want to give them views.
rules for thee not me   right i wish this was made up.
i have a question have you or anyone in the comments watched mon phycho 100
there was also an episode from mindy project called  mindy laheri is a white man.  a dream sequence episode where if you are white that you can get away with everything  and nothing in your life in will ever be hard. yeah that happened.
the characters was  diversified  so they can neither claim  colourblind  nor fan racism because they are the real racists!
shaggy is also a pot head unfortunately.
the reason why velma sucked so hard is not because of racism or woke culture or sexismit s because its straight up not scooby-doowhen we think scooby-doo we think  mysteries  ghosts  clues  food  splitting up  meddling kids  zoinks  jinkies  jeepers and random chase musicnot angst against the world! not woke memes! not 4th wall breaking realism! not anything that velma the show is!
you should look into the activision supporting the maps stuff. absolutely disgusting.
she makes a racist show and then accuses the audience of being racist when they criticize the show.
i have hbo  and i will check it  i do understand correctly that there is some sexual things with kids in that animation
its just a hateful show. its like the only reason they created this was to spite people  not just fans but everyone across the board. its like they are projecting everything they hate about themselves and the world. to them its funny  because they lack self-awareness. but everyone looking from the outside can see the bs. and it tries to be edgy  but it feels forced. it s not funny cause it s not genuine.
good to know
wait... whut !
@skrydon78  wish i was kidding
wow.
haha she s so sassy!  it s beautiful to see this trash show fall apart
the irony when i see shows that demonize men  usually the most likable characters or memorable characters are the men. i hate that we can t have men be cool  assertive  manly...we re just buffoons now and still  people tend to like the male characters over the insufferable female characters. even women i know prefer male superheroes over the female superheroes for example. i prefer older entertainment over any of this crap we have today  1930s-1990s  and it s crazy how well written a lot of female characters were back then  than the current ones of today  even with all the technology...i thought we were suppose to be a smarter society now. hmmm!
ar least the teenagers  tm    are censored to some degree. not full naked. but they are at least older than most anime girls in similar situations. but yeah  2 episodes watched from the boat on the high seas  arg ye matee!  and no more. velma is dumb.
the sexualization is totally different anime uses it to drive the plot and comic relief but i agree with you velma sucks
commenting to feed the algorithm
she s pretty  lmao no
at the first part of the video. whomp  whomp  whooooooomp! hahahaha i needed that belly laugh. now for the rest of it. it s funny how she did that to a white guy and got away with it but if he did it to her  oh boy! he would of gotten fired and then hit with sexual harassment charges. double standard to the max. what made it even worse is people laughed at it.
reduce the size of your facecam.said it many times before. rather than move your facecam to the side in anyone of your videos  shorten or reduce the size. everything you stated is spot on  but the point i stated about your facecam remains.
welp... this was made out of spite and even the excuse of a parody don t really work
22many will say to me on that day   lord  lord  did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles   23then i will tell them plainly   i never knew you. away from me  you evildoers!
i actually don t hate the snippets i ve seen of it and i m more conservative rick and morty and bojack horseman annoy me way more literally if they didn t have the scooby doo characters in this it would just be another crappy progressive adult cartoon that gets cancelled after or one or 2 seasons it s not much different than the other ones
you look good pale
hmm lee pace is married to a man in real life fun factoid
and i didn t even vote
check out timothy alberino!
didn t even watch it and i don t care to watch it  don t even know why everyone else bothered to as it just gives the show more views  meaning more income  meaning more seasons  that s basically shooting yourself in the foot.
kallings on off boyfriend is bj novak.. bj
stephen he  failure. wham!!! emotional damage.
the thing i don t get it s  why a warner ip on hbo  owened by warner  allowed this to happened. didn t the new ceo made a purge of people with this shitty woke ideas a few months back
we live in the most racist era  where racism is practically becoming something legal  how crazy. o.o
legend of the overfiend....yikes. did anyone really want an adult version of scooby doo
telegram scam has made it here!
hypothetical situation  black person throws garbage on the ground  then proceeds to record it for 6 hours. on day a network exec somewhere decides to use those recording and make a 6 episode series out of it  and tries to sell it because it was created by a black  creator .me - yeah  i don t like itmedia - your racist!somethings are just objectively bad.
yeah pretty melonie  nobody likes velma the tv show only make people angry.
book of enoch
if only  metoo applied to women  smh.
yea  i have to say that  for example  indian youtuber wannalana aahana is an attractive woman to me  but mindy kaling or mindy s character in the the office -- total pass. i don t care if she has money or status -- no  sorry. its not the race
omg mindy sucks in gen but this show i made it 11 min into first episode only!  no more ever !!
anime is fucked 60  of the time but at least you can blame the nukes jokingly but in america when hollywood people s cartoons is doing things with kids it s worse cause it s literally happening irl too while everyone is pointing at it saying stop.
don t say  heckin  it s weird.that is all.
as terrible as that show is i d hate to imagine anyone subjecting themselves to watching it just to ridicule it. honestly does not deserve the attention.
when you re so woke  the woke thinks it s woke  maybe this show needs to be in a new category going even further left then woke  nah let s just go back to basics and call it shit
can t hear the videos you re playing there melonie.
daphne didn t even look asian but she is voiced by an asian. they are lazy.
why they call it woke
so you wants to be the next harvey weinstein
oh the irony of screen rant calling people racists for criticizing the show for being racist. can t make this shit up but perfectly fitting in clown world
i agreed with everything you said until you said she was pretty...woof..nope
wow even the woke people don t like this
what about it
i ve never found mindy funny. even her cameo in night at the museum was just annoying. also  the actor she kissed without permission was lee pace  who is gay  so it was most definitely an uncomfortable and unwanted experience for him. not that being straight would make it permissible  but can you imagine if a straight guy did that to a lesbian just because he thought she was hot
damn worst than she hulk
jenkies
colorblind ! but it didn t include blue people! since avatar 2 we know they are somehow very important now  and not caring about that is racist. the woke racists make me so angry! again!
boom
i m not gonna touch this garbage show with a 10 or 15 inch barge pole
whitout all these woke people melonie has no content. becarefull you wont become a one trick pony melonie! all these anti woke content is getting old. so many youtubers are doing the same thing.   i agree woke ruining a lot
you re missing the point mel. they are actually succeeding! they meant to gain fame with how bad it is... they are doing great! and you talking about it just fuels that dumpster fire.
wow so the woke 14 percent of the population that it was made for didn t like it
if nothing else it s definitely got the  horror  part down. because that show is horrifyingly bad.
it is a double standard. but still true.. a woman s3xually assaulting a man is not as big of a deal.
mindy kaling should be blacklisted in hollywood for this. nobody s perfect  but this was knowingly  egregiously racist and hateful.
meep
imagine if kanye made a cartoon bashing on jews and talking about how bad they are. all hell would break loose  no outrage from this show though
to sum it up  the velma show is complete trash!
seems like daphne va is trying to save her a   after seeing the failure of the series. if she didn t like it then she wouldn t have accepted the va job in the first place.
hey melonie  i saw a spam comment here that a bunch of youtubers are getting. i flagged it. just letting you know!
i m so glad no one actually likes this show
horror-comedy is not synonymous with horrible-writing. also  being critical of horrible-writing has nothing to do with being racist.  hollyweird lost it a long time ago.  they prove they are incapable of learning anything.
well said
it sure is
yup i get them every day  impossible for me to find them every time. thank you so much for flagging!
@meloniemacgoboom  no problem!
same
anime creep and gross...well beserk has top that all i will say casca
based
pretty
you need glasses.
bokuno pico
mindi sounds kinda racist
the only difference is the anime is good while this show is trash
i mean the show did change known white characters to other races  that s kind of racist towards white people  racism against any race is terrible even white people
if anything....the show is racist.
i have never liked mindy. her attitude  her opinions  her comedy  are all terrible.
even the real daphne knows this cheap family guy cartoon copy n past template sweashop standard copium fest that is velma is a flaming mounting of unwanted garbage.
velma is the worst show ever made in history lmao...
worst so far
women can kiss me with or without my permission
be a pleasant person. not an evil racist activist  .that s asking a lot from wokies.
i like it... and i voted for trump
1st
@chandlerburse2754  you are not far wrong
