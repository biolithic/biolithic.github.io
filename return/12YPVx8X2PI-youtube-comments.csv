kinda unrelated to the video but!i am so glad i found your channel! i found out recently my iron levels were suuuuuper low. you ve inspired me to eat more red meat! i still kinda eat everything but have added waaaay more meat to my diet and am feeling so much better! thank you for the inspo. also really appreciate you sharing your faith! it s encouraging to see a fellow gamer   woman   christian

thank you for this and god bless you. it needs to be said  it s great to hear someone in the gaming community tell the truth and exposing satan s deceptions.

i hope you get better very very soon the sooner the better. i be praying for you
