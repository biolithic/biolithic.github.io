anita sarkeesian and her ilk may have changed the industry  but it doesnt mean us gamers are happy about it.  great job praying on camera for the first time! it was my first time praying along with a youtuber.

I have to say  Im really glad I found this channel.its such a relief to find someone who is more than willing to share her opinions on strong subjects  and is also open to others. its also so amazing that you and I share faith in our Lord God  and I am honored to have you as a sister in Christ. a cute  entertaining  and friendly gamer girl! 

yoooooo! this is my first time seeing one of your videos and the way you stopped and prayed for that young man mid video was a pleasant surprise! Im inching towards thatsubscribe button.

hey Im glad I found your channel  this woke culture is definitely destroying the industry I hope companies are realizing that most ppl cant stand this pc stuff. anyways nice to see a strong woman is who is nerdy and isn t afraid to express her faith in God.

thank you so much! you are all so amazing and I cannot thank you enough! Im so thankful for this community where I can come to listen and hear such beautiful words and be a part of a positive group that values morals and prayer. this really made my day and my upcoming birthday!

we need more people like you melonie cause your definitely a Godsend.

love the Bible verses and the prayer mel! please keep it up! one thing I got to add being a guy in gaming  is a majority of my favorite games star a female  shadow of the tomb raider  metroid  a plague s tale  innocence  horizon zero dawn  mass effect  male or female   older pokemon games  male or female   etc. I can go on and on of amazing games starred by a female. I think men and women are important in games. both can potray stories in different manners. I think women have a good spot in gaming honestly.

you have a big heart - the prayer on video was amazing. rooting for you chris.I suppose I should thank anita for the many hours Ive spent with kassandra  but that doesnt make up for what she and her kind did to bioware and my beloved mass effect franchise rip.

first Bible verses and now prayer   this is great!  also that entire isaiah chapter  53  is just one of the best chapters of the old testament.

I discovered you from your fnt appearance.  Ive been watching more and more of your vids since then and Im loving your content.  especially since we seem to have a lot of similar beliefs.we both do not like wokeness and how its negatively affecting entertainment and the country.   I also eating carnivore and absolutely love it.   now today I see you are also a Christian!!!  seeing you pray on video was great.  I really admire people who aren t afraid to tell others of their religious beliefs.  its something Ive had trouble with in the past so you are a great encouragement to me.

it was so refreshing to hear a young person pray on camera. that immediately got my subscription. God-bless you
