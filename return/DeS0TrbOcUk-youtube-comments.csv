melonie  thank you for your verses of the day and for your prayer group. Im an atheist on a bad day and an agnostic theist on a good day  but something compelled me to go to your prayer group. I had a wonderful experience and would love to tell you about itsomeday as it was incredible. your community was wonderful and welcoming and I will definitely be back next week.

this stuff either makes you want pray for the humanity to be better  or pray for the asteroid to take humanity.

love the verse of the day!

hI melonie  I appreciate your courage to stand up as a Christian
