I know you think you went a little long with yesterdays stream but I found it quite informative.   your streams when you discuss things you are passionate about like your faith and nutrition seem to fly-by quickly.  I give it five stars out of five.

I was almost 400 lbs before I was 20  under 200 now and 33 years old  and no one can convince me that being fat is okay when I know what it feels like to have back pain and neck pain from just walking a few houses down the street to get a slurpy at the gas station.I understand if someone is fine with being big but I just cant get behind celebrating being so unhealthy.

I saw this just as Im adjusting stuff in my life to make some changes so thanks!!side note... great to see someone who is not ashamed of their faith. yah bless.

hello melonie I just wanted wish you to have enjoyable coming weekend. thank you for sharing your passion on sharing Bible scriptures  course the interesting topics you bring to life. take care melonie

I was about to comment how refreshing it is to have found your channel  but then you knocked the poor cleveland browns. we are the down trodden! and you know what Jesus said about that!  p anyways.... love your channel and I will continue to watch even though you are a steelers fan. thank you for standing for your values and being such an awesome voice out there.

I was in a car accident last year around march. a 6 car pile up  I was generally ok thankfully but when I went to the er and I saw my weight  I was 268. im 5 10 and thatshocked me. I instantly knew I had to change. I started eating much better and working out every other day. Im currently 215 and I haven t felt this good in a long time. I bulked up and slimmed down. I would highly recommend everyone work out and dont be fat! melonie you should be happy at your body progress I know I am!

I think it was about 3 months ago now when I said that you helped inspire me to get in shape. well  I am down 25lbs  10  body weight  and started taking the first step of building muscle  push ups  crunches  light weights  etc. . still have about another 15 to 25 pounds before I am happy with the weight  but I will continue to get healthy. thank you for doing what you do.

I only found your channel a weeks ago or so. your content is great.
