elizabeth banks is not a clown. she is the entire circus.
that s what happens when you re a narcissistic person that can t take consequences and blame everyone else for them
the nerve on this woman... wow!after that charlie s angels b.s she expects anyone to hire her she lacks self awareness so much that it s mind boggling.
she doesn t want to get into the action movie genre  she wants to subvert it.  and if she s too subverting for a current mcu movie  that s saying something!
talked to a screenwriter working for paramount. he stated that most actors  producers  directors  unions in the industry are completely detached from reality. they really don t see their own hypocrisy. they make statements thinking it ll be profitable and noble and are shocked that it isn t.
elizabeth  no thanks  banks wants to fail upward but couldn t
for once marvel did something right. awesome video  thanks for chiming in.
marvel s got 99 problems but elizabeth banks ain t one
protect this woman at all costs  please.  3 great video!
the scene in power rangers where the town is getting destroyed and banks casually eats donuts in a diner must be one of the most hilarious scenes in the franchise. not technically her fault but still...
i don t know how you screw up charlie s angels  but she found a way.
i would ve tried to get the original cast back from charlie s angels and try to pass the baton to the new cast. while keeping the fun  comedy  and sex appeal.instead of making into a woke empowerment movie. that s just from the top of my head.
when you re too woke for disney marvel you know you ve gone too far.
it s like if hallmark started making rom-coms for men  told their existing audience it s  not made for you  possibly calling them  privileged     problematic  in the process   and then blamed women for low viewership.
elizabeth banks is insane. she s lost it. she s gone. real gone
wow!!! even marvel doesn t want elizabeth banks. i m sorry i laugh every time you say  glob  . i get it  i don t swear either. it just makes me laugh. god bless melonie. and keep her safe this weekend. and bless her with lots of fun today. in jesus name  amen
i miss the days when i was eager to see a marvel movie  with a few exceptions  the last one i enjoyed was endgame  and even it had some flaws  but it was entertaining. to even consider elizabeth banks for marvel is funny to me  feels way out of her wheelhouse.
elizabeth banks  i want a job.also elizabeth banks  i don t like working with other people s vision.also also elizabeth banks  why won t anyone hire me  must be sexism.
even marvel can get something right  lol. hope you re having a fantastic weekend melonie. you look amazing
you would think the fact she not getting work  should get her to understand nobody likes what she is doing.
y all hating on her  just watch brightburn
@ox_true protagonist chris redfield_xo  her being choked out and dropped out of the sky was the only worthwhile thing she did in that movie
@ox_true protagonist chris redfield_xo  that movie was a cool concept but it was pretty stale watching it more than once.
5 rings with no safety net
sounds like our political parties
i still remember her being passive aggressive about her movie. such a great sales pitch.... i was like  oh wow.... now i m most certainly not gonna watch your movie.  there was a time i didn t bother with who directed produced the movies coz they were usually good quality. that changed some 5 years ago. i now am very picky coz most that comes out these days it s unwatchable dog shite! and that s even putting it mildly.
you chose the long way of saying feminist.
perfect fit for marvel
yes. it seems like she is a narcissist. everything is others fault. others have to change. and everything who has a bit of brain sees  she is the best. she is perfect. that s her mindset. if they don t hire her  it s some ism or phobia  or it s jealousy  but has nothing to do with her  perfect work .they like being actors. are good in it. just play a role. be someone appreciated. doesn t matter what it is. but they always want more and more. want to influence. and they aren t creative and have no empathy  don t know what others would like. a role  yes. something more complex  no. so they just write a  story  about themself and their  enemies  from their rl. and servants. it s always something like a payback and humiliation. so they try to influence  usually at a point where you can t replace them as actor anymore. they say  do it my way  or i won t work. the company loses here  always  legal battle means a huge delay for the movie and costs millions. so usually they let the narcissist decide some things. if they do so  and change 20  for the narcissist  and that s why the movie failed  in the narcissist s opinion it is  because it wasn t 100  like they wanted it to be. in their opinion something like that proves  they were right. success proves it  fails prove it  everything proves it. and so you get people like her  thinking they can do everything. walking around and being surprised to not get hired. usually for them it s some ism or phobia  so they end up as activists or with identity politics
directs a movie and demands that men not attend.  then blames men for not attending.
not really current. this is back in the ragnarok days which was a bit before the pussification of the entire series. like she said  ragnarok was the beginning of that shift. that and ant man  and the wasp .
she s been failing upwards for years. how was she supposed to know this time it wouldn t happen
this was prior to charlie s angels!
hilarious
she is the wrong color for that to work.
did they  i get elizabeth banks was a bad choice  but taika waititi wasn t what you call a good director either.
@loki-of-asgard  i agree but denying elizabeth banks was still something they did right in my opinion.
eve thought of the fact they rejected her because they were already settled on director  do you even bother to read feige s numerous statements how they go about choosing directors
@paul langland . they denied her in the directing role but they re still open for her as casting i bet.
i m a little shocked too
@gloria thomas  yup  feige s director hiring is what gunn is emulating for his dc actors  easy to work with  yes men women.
for once   what does that even mean   have you not seen any movie from iron man to endgame
@flinty braz  since phase 4 began it s been a lot of blunders. it s been a lot of sad news from marvel. i m sorry if my wording wasn t perfect.
wouldn t be surprised if feige tries to hire!
mission accepted  commander. commencing mission. agents deployed. setting up a protective perimeter around the target. security protocols engaged.
i got a stick that can bonk good
i did not watch that movie. i heard about the scene and thought it was stupid. i also did not like the messages in it. another flop.
@cain abel  you don t like the message of team work and accepting others
@cain abel  that was actually a funny scene. also  the messages were very well done.the problem with power rangers  2017  was that the editing was unfocused. i did a re-edit of the film that focuses on jason  kimberly  and billy and removes the zack and trini scenes  to push them more into the background. that really helped the film. also  i rearranged the scenes with jason and his father so that their conflict lasts throughout the film rather being pretty much resolved early on  which makes it so jason has conflict with zordon in parallel to the conflict he has with his father . that really helped the film too. i also re-added some of the deleted footage  because it was good  and i have no idea why any editor worth their salt would remove it. i also re-cut the scene between rita and trini to make rita appear more insane and terrifying.overall  i found the way the story should ve been told and brought it all together. i also changed out a bit of the music to bring the classic power rangers theme into the start of the final battle.in short  the movie was good  it was just the editing was pretty bad and made the movie look bad. if you like power rangers  i would still recommend watching the movie as it is  simply because the movie s director took the source material seriously and tried to make a good movie  and i have a lot of respect for him for doing that. plus  bryan cranston is awesome as zordon  and elizabeth banks does a really cool rendition of rita. i was sad that there was only one scene that the two of them appeared in together.
@the deadpool who chuckles.  why do you need a film to tell you to accept others .did your parents fail at parenting
she helped ruin power rangers. that right there should tell you something about her crazy ass
that would have been something. it s not like cameron diaz  drew barrymore  and lucy liu are all that busy these days.
the charlie s angels movie she made. it seemed more like a ego trip. with her character getting as much or more screen time than the angels themselves. it s charlie s angels not bosley and co.
so your ingenious plan would be to do what ever remake has done
charlies angels is about as formulaic as there is. hot chicks  mtv style editing  current cool music  and someone like bill murray as comic relief. you ve got cameo opportunities all over the place. bring back a villain from the original tv show  if there are any still alive. if you can t break even directing what should be just harmless entertaining popcorn fodder  you re in the wrong line of work.
i don t get why people even want this type of movie i rather not have a new cast at all.i never did watch ghostbusters afterlife because the original cast had very little in it and i  am not sure how to feel about the egon ghost thing.i really wished bill murray just made a movie about all those insane times dan ackroyd tried so hard to force a gb3 script on him.maybe its good but it won t be better than the original two.
you don t need to originals to make a good film. you need a good script
that and most of the time disney marvel wants cheap no name talent so they can control and under pay them. marvel doesn t have directors  they have glorified acting coaches.
she s directing cocaine bear ! . i was looking forward to that movie. it looked like a dumb fun good time. according to her imbd page  she has 2 shorts and 3 actual movies. she was also in scrubs and i love that show.
i bet marvel would have said yes to her directing an m-she-u movie.
elizabeth would ve been perfect for she-hulk xd
you re awesome! keep up the great work
imagine saying   only men can direct men.  i guess  owyn   lyra belacqua  nancy drew and lisbeth salander don t count !
i dont think they rejected her because she hates on men. probably just wanted to go with tika because he is a comedian director and they were full tilt into the guardian of the galaxy humor
ragnarok was definitely the best standalone thor movie. just the right amount of serious and comedy with some decent character development with thor realizing his true power made a nice change of pace and really helped to set him up well for infinity war. glad even marvel was sensible enough to never contact her back!
i don t get approached much about doing anything
continuing to watch marvel is hard to justify
i can t figure this out given the massive success of her interpretation of charlie s angels  .kidding.
banks   i d like to direct a movie for you hit me back.  marvel   we can do bad on our on.
i remember sitting down at a mall once and reading an old thor comic  and how much different it was from watching thor in that ragnarok movie.  i think that was one of the first moments of me eventually deciding to ignore the mcu movies  although i didn t fully stop until after endgame.i think i ve only seen one elizabeth banks movie  pitch perfect  and even then not the whole thing.  i was with one of my sisters at the time  i really didn t care for it  definitely not the kind of movie i would watch regularly!!!
hey melonie. hope you re having a rockin weekend.
you would ve loved my pastor s message today  it made me think of you. mostly on how so many people in the world are lost and will always be because not enough people who call themselves christians are doing anything in their lives to serve god  especially in fear of being judged by the world. you are one of only a few influencers i can say are doing a great job at serving him through your go boom channel here and it s inspiring me to find my thing to serve. you re doing it right and people in the world are hating but we re here to remind you that you have all the support in the world from us to counter the negativity. i hope you re enjoying your sunday so far  keep up the great work but remember to rest too. and hydrate!
i wonderful explanation from melonie about the utter lack of awareness of the esteemed ms. banks. and thank you melonie for the history lesson on mrs. unaware 2023.
i m surprised marvel didn t take her  she fits soo well in that m-she-u phase bore and on
she only wants to tell her own vision  but the mcu has been based on feige s vision from the start.  more than one director has left because of creative differences.  shame jessica gao s vision matched up.
before video  i love me some elizabeth banks.  she s no melonie mac  but she s still elizabeth banks.after video
i can t do someone else s vision.  and  let me pitch myself to direct part of an intricately interconnected cinematic universe where my work is just a part of the whole  orchestrated by someone else.  does she really struggle to see the connection  or rather failed connection  here
man  i do want to see the failure happen. i just want to see who or what she will blame. i will not go to see even if someone pays me. apparently these aren t enough examples to let these industries to get it.
it s probably why she s directing that movie  had to work on something ridiculous that looks fun just to make money.
do you know who directed zero dark thirty  that was an awesome movie  and it was directed by a woman  kathryn bigelow. she also directed the hurt locker and point break  with keanu reeves .
@gabriel  great points  and great movies! it s all about the art  not chromosomes.
they wanted mindy kaling instead
hard to believe the same guy did ragnarok and girl thor...
roflmao
nothing to be gained from religion....
she literally inserted herself into scrubs in the 4th season. epic gaslighting
i think one of the biggest reasons she s not getting work on movies these days is because she s had so many failures.  she s basically box office poison at this point.
keep up the good work
how the f do you mess up charlie s angels  mcg did an awesome job with cameron diaz  drew berrymore  and lucy liu.
it s hard to hit and miss on these movies.
they probably didn t want her in their project for the same reason that people don t install viper pits in the living room.
i was a weird hybrid mix in highschool  huge gamer nerd  but also very athletic so i played football lmao  there was a few time if i got made fun for hanging with my actual friends and we were all friends  i didnt care to much about the jock groups or popularity  would just challenge them to basically any physical activity and would win a majority of the time  eventually somehow they just quit making fun of me and also i just started to ignore them  but ya gaming is amazing
she should just film charlie s angels ii   please watch this movie!
i geniuenely had to think long and hard to remember who elizabeth banks is and then melonie says charlie s angel  and i felt like i was trying to look into abyss
yet they had no issue hiring the writer of she-hulk.
don t forget zack snyder was a producer and writer on wonder woman.crediting patty jenkins with the success of wonder woman is maybe overselling her capabilities.
thor  rag had more than enough  gurl powrawr!!!  going on so it sure didn t need her  sensibilities .
her direction will be  love and thunder  in every moment.
banks doing an superhero  action or science fiction movie  would be like tarantino doing a sex in the city movie. although a tarantino sitc movie would be good in this case  the people that like it wouldn t.
hot babes who kick but  boom  you nailed it.
the problem are the people hiring these people. they do not care for the franchises. they care about money and power. they will hire them to get them to put a message in it  their message. this is why people are so tired of these corporations and the stuff they put out. if they want to fix this  then they need to hire people  that actually value the stuff.
i play dragon age origins from time to time.i decided to create a  fireball slinging  mage character.  since he is all about throwing damaging spells  i named him   mcboom  as a joke!later i thought to myself   wait!  did i just steal melanie s channel name  .  lol
huh  thought they would eagerly take her into their company.
marvel mostly rejected her because they most likely have settled on a director. just so you know these things are made years in advance before principle photography commences. do people even bother to read feige s numerous interviews where he talks about marvel studios process  of doing things  also i doubt banks is the only director that has ever been rejected by ms.
the thing hogwarts legacy has taught us is while the mob will complain  if you make something of quality  they will buy it anyway.
i don t know the pit is pretty helpful in keeping people in my home and i can finally realize do my buffalo bill cosplay
@blackdragoonv7  put the f n boa in the basket!!
that s a fair point.  i d even take it a step further and say any director not directing for marvel has been rejected by marvel  which puts her on equal footing with 99  of directors.
to be fair  they hired the she-hulk  writers   so it isn t that far fetched
melonie i am glad that you are enjoying hogwarts legacy it s a fun game that reminds me of fable thoughts
honestly seems like she d fit in with the current direction of marvel.
aw given how the way disney i wished they d have  we could ve had a laugh at another disney failure.
feminists    let me grab this gun  aim at my own foot  and squeeze the trigger...   bang    men invented guns  and it is their fault for me shooting myself in the foot!
to be honest with you if she had gotten the directors chair  i more than likely wouldn t have watched it in theaters. given how she screwed up charlie s angels. lol
we may  may  be getting to the point that woke directors along with woke actors actresses are becoming unattractive to studios because their movies tank at the box office.  go woke go broke  is a real thing and studios aren t in this to go out of business.
that sucks to hear she s turned into one of those. she was one of the few actresses that was actually funny
i would love to see elizabeth banks write bidens autobiography and diversify it...
banks is mad because she will always be  that one hot chick from 40 year old virgin  and that s it.
just watched you on critical drinker.  good job! sub d both channels.
hey she was great as rita repulsa.just give her a role as a new marvel villain  like for example the evil bikini blonde.
i was sorta looking forward to cocaine bear  and then i found out it was elizabeth banks directing it.
oh patty jenkins being the force behind wonder woman turned out to be a lie. zack snyder saved that movie and there were all these safety nets for patty jenkins. they had to keep up the woman directing woman lie. when patty jenkins had to actually do it herself we got ww84. also her pitch for wonder woman 3 involved steve trevor being  brought back to life  this time with the lazarus pit. it also had ra s ah ghul as the villain.  the movie would have ended with ww leaving trevor with amanda waller in a ripoff of what the mcu did with winter soldier. apparently when giving notes to tweak the story patty jenkins threw a fit saying they don t understand her or the vision and even emailed her boss a wikipedia link the definition of character arc which got her fired.
i loved the underworld action movies
@melonie mac  let s be real here  despite making the kitchen joke  you technically never have to be in the kitchen.    your last name is  mac   your family is of the  big mac dynasty   you have personal servants and cooks that make you fresh big macs with ground prime rib patties  fresh keto buns  all the topings fleshly grown  cut  and mixed xdhappy sunday melonie  p
that s what it sounds like when you re too high off your own farts.
every time i hear the words  tomb raider  in melonie s voice it s like the sound of a nerdy war horn.as for elizabeth banks  was she always nuts or is this just the madness of the last decade infecting her
guaranteed if she made a marvel movie pitch today they d say yes. ok maybe not today but the last 2 years in phase bore of the m-she-u
she s perfect for marvel phase 6!
i hope the bring on mindy kaling   sarah silverman for season 2. the trifecta!
@this is what happens  larry  that in of itself would be one of the signs of the apocalypse.
i knew i wasn t the only one who gets subtle fable vibes from this game. the atmosphere is kind of similar.also helped that i played through fable 3 like a week ago lol
it looks so brilliant  never played a harry potter game before but this will definitely be one of them i can see playing for a good while.
lmao

more like that eric andre   why would men do this   gun meme.
yeah   parker posey  janine garofalo  and elizabeth banks were funny.  garofalo went nuts when gw bush was president.  banks went nuts later.
i still remember banks from the 40-year-old virgin .  funny as hell  then.  then i remember that was 2005  technology and culture changed quite a bit in the 14 years leading to charlie s angels .
@alice bowie  parker posey is annoying.she cemented this for me in the walking dead spinoff she did
this just made me hungry. i want all of those things now.
@lvthor ascending   i ve watched some videos of people making the quote unquote 600 buck versions of fast food or candy bars.  some look really good.
elizabeth banks forgot she directed charlie s angels.i don t blame her.  everyone wants to forget about that remake.
her recent movie about abortion is much more up her alley i am sure.
i watch movies to be entertained  not to be attacked  lectured  brainwashed  or talked down to. this is something they need to get back to. my movie consumption is almost non-existent compared to my past. so sick of all these agendas  i just want to be entertained.
banks was pretty good in the power rangers movie
spot on. has she ever directed a successful film
weirdest part is that charlie s angels came out a couple years after ragnarok. but then again  if she did direct thor 3  she would ve made thor look even worse than the clown he was already made into.
at least elizabeth has  cocaine bear.
probably for the best  with what marvel is putting out i wouldn t even want to be in it.
they probably rejected her not for being misandrist  but because her last movie was a bomb.
that didn t stop them from hiring  and keeping  btw  the clowns that wrote and directed she-hulk. the mcu just wasn t woke enough for her when ragnarok came out. nowadays it probably would be.
no one wants elizabeth banks to  bring  her  sensibility  to things  in any action  gaming or superhero movie.
i still think the first iron man was the highlight of the marvel movies
it s my impression it s an unspoken rule that you don t get the job if you publicly ask for it. so her asking for the director s position was a rather unwise move.
posers are easy to spot in all fandoms.
i m a woman and i don t particularly enjoy action movies. i decided to finally watch mad max fury road...which  except for tom hardy and the villain  is primarily led by women. and it was awesome without having to shove feminism down my throat to be so.
why would banks  ideology and wanting to insert it into a movie bother marvel  though  isn t that basically their whole deal now
this is the woman who was dissing spider-man during her charlie s angel press tour.
if she can t carry other people s visions  why not make her own new creations  and  she should keep trying through phase  it s the best time for pretenders
all she will do is blame the fans
wait. miri  without zack  made a charlie s angels
ragnorak treated the thor character bad enough. can you imagine what she would have done  worse than loathe and blunder.
she just wanted to direct chris hemsworth and hold his mighty hammer in her hand.
banks was alright in scrubs and slither.
i m surprised marvel didn t take her up  based on she hulk we know now they don t their fans and think little of them
i am not saying a woman can t direct an action movie  but banks doesn t have the heart to make a good one. there are reasons why male directors have a higher tendency to make strong women.even my girlfriend says that if she and i have a daughter someday  she is more likely to want to emulate how i am  which is calculating but can kindle that fire in my heart at a given notice and that s the kind of woman that she would love to see as well as i to see a woman that can not only inspire woman  but for men equally to stand for a better tomorrow seriously why do you think wonder woman was a success
wokies are the embodiment of the old adage  misery loves company.
she has 7 director listings on imdb  none of them groundbreakers  and i have a strong feeling that cocaine bear will flop. she s not ready for the big time yet and she should do something about her overblown ego.
i love that the man hating psycho has a movie coming out that will be watched by a 99.99999  male audience
disney marvel is feeling it.
honestly it doesn t even matter because taika basically took the demasculating route in love and thunder anyways
i always find it strange that many feminists believe that all women must have the same views as they do. as long as feminism is characterised by  equal pay for equal work  - of course. if feminism means  hate men   i have a question  what actually distinguishes them from machos
she could have done captain marvel lol
i feel like the past 10 years have been the best and worst timeline for fantasy  syfi and games to the big screen. there have been amazing works and great talent shown. yet the whole telling  our  story not the original has ruined my faith in anything coming out. i don t want a single movie or tv series made anymore till we get this whole thins sorted out.
directors don t write the script
i thought the industry practice is  don t call us we ll call you. taika was one of the directors in the 2011 thor.  it was successful.  it is logical to use him again.   elizabeth  it is not all about you. i m tired about ragnar k.  between ac valhalla and god of war i m tired.  mostly the stories make no sense.  for one  spoiler  i thought odin was a good guy until god of war.  likewise about thor.
didn t she have a hand in the creative for the power rangers movie  these days i d rather stick with video games than movies with all these crappy movies coming out nowadays. god bless you  melonie.
it says a lot when even marvel turns you down.
it s funny how they then turned the next thor into some feminist thing  she must have been like  i could have done that
mc g has been laughing his ass off all the way to the bank for years
it s never about equality. it s always about power. it s never about fairness. it s about advancement. it s never about the empathy. it s about narcissism.to incorrectly quote talieson jaffe. i find that most people extol the virtues that they themselves lack.
it s probably pretty low-budget  so i can see it breaking even or eking out a small profit.  cgi bear is probably the most expensive part.  but then again  i can see them doing something stupid like licensing 30 top-100 songs like they did for  cruella .
if uwe boll movies has brought more joy to people than your movies  then there s probably a problem that should be resolved.
i m confused explain she-hulk than  it seems to me marvel should want her to direct movies.
imagine not being good enough for the bottom of the barrel that is now disney.
elizabeth banks is one of them...
the power rangers reboot was the last time i saw banks before realizing she was a psychotic leftist. as bad as she is as a director  i thought she was terrific as rita repulsa. i hate it when these psychos actually have some admirable work in their history because as much as i want to completely ignore them  i can t because i love what came before.
every time i hear you say glob i instantly think of adventure time.comic book movies are just as bad as comic books themselves. characters and origins changed so much they might as well be new characters. maybe if enough people put their spin we can get back to the beginning when superhero movies were good.
and now she wants to direct a dcu movie lmao . let her destroy that franchise
i love how based mel is shed awesome but she s also in a different age bracket as these stupid lil modern feminists lol.
she loves losing a bunch of money and blaming everyone for her own problems i ain t an expert but i know she is terrible for business i wouldn t call back either
daym i like her in scrubs  never thought that she would be a woke mess like this.
even kevin feige is now saying  hey  we have to actually entertain people .  imagine that.  by the way i think the critical drinker or someone made a video a while back about how hollywood and particularly the mcu simply can t write realistic men well anymore.  i tend to agree  and disliked a lot of ragnarok for that.  it s a movie that had its good points  but it s far  far from perfect.
kinda makes me wonder what s going to happen with cocaine bear. after all  she ruined charlie s angels...
thor ragnarok by elizabeth banks would not have been worse than the obscenity they made.
patty jenkins didn t write ww1. she directed a film that two dudes wrote.
considering how much of a botch job wateenee did on the last thor flick   i almost am curious how banks would have done  probably the same or worse more than likely. taika is a nut job.
as much as i like the first thor movie  it wasn t true to the comic book.  most movie goers had no idea because the mighty thor isn t one of the greatest comic book heroes of all time- because marvel doesn t own them.
she was pretty good in power rangers.
dave chappelle said it best about feminism. its just the belief that men and women should get treated fairly and equally with regard to pay and work. equal pay for equal work. the shit we got going on nowadays is toxic feminism  or some other label. its weird but i think whacktavist is a better word to describe her.
because the film was good as it was
in the mcu could it be she blames her failures on men   no. no it can t. have you seen what happens with every other mcu phase 4 movie   not to mention showit is a male dominated genre  but they are doing everything they can to turn the creators female so again i m not sure why she wouldn t be almost the perfect choice. if she wasn t it s because she s not a good director not because of her ideas on feminismshe didn t get a call because the love affair with taiki waititi wasn t over. it was after that movie and she couldn t have made it worse
at least uwe boll occasionally enters  so bad it s good  territory.
still waiting on part ii of drinker s rant . anyone not drinking the kool-aid misses the existence of male role models.
contact me for your reward
i loled hard you throwing out women in kitchen jokes  although i m wondering if they assumed you were a man or kid trolling them.
hi melonie i hope your weekend has been going well for you. hey melonie have youthought about doing anothermilitary challenge like you haddone with few other youtubers   takecare melonie
imma say it. i never liked thor  ragnorak. we never got thor as he should have been. watch avengers  earth s mightiest heroes. that s thor. mighty. epic. shakespearean. heroic. the thor we got in thor  ragnorak was tony stark meets guardians of the galaxy. way too much comedy  sci-if  bright colors  80s music  and a butchering of the norse mythos. i remember how in the first film they toyed with the idea of how asgardian power could be magic  maybe really advanced science mortals couldn t comprehend  but didn t give you a 100  answer. by dark world  it was nearly answered it was science and tech  boring. all the plot and meaningful character development in thor  ragnorak was either side swiped by a joke  or moved way too fast. what happened to the fact that thor was supposed to learn humility in the first film  that glory of combat  the throne  his own ego  etc. meant nothing in comparison to service  family  and friends  by ragnorak  he was almost the same guy all over again  he cared more about proving he could beat hulk  that he was called god of thunder and not lord of thunder  or that mjolnir was the source of all his power. was barely a hero in the film. it was played up for laughs  and hardly relied on any actual norse mythology unlike the comics.
women in the kitchen jokes are funny every time.
i think that you re wrong as to why banks didn t get a marvel directorship. marvel absolutely wants feminism. kevin feige is a feminist. and they re looking for female directors for the m-she-u. i think the timing was just wrong. maybe her pitch sucked. but even if good  nobody would take thor 3 from taika after thor 2 was so well received.i do agree with you in that i don t want banks involved with any comic or marvel or dc property. i don t particularly like her. but i may eat my words with cocaine bear. that actually looks good  despite banks.
let s be honest  taika waititi who ended up directing thor ragnarock was absolutely horrible. if he can put out a pile of dog crap for marvel  there is hope for elizabeth banks.
well  we can at least predict her excuse for being rejected by marvel.
tell good stories and you win  push agendas and you lose!
marvel has gotten super woke and even they denied banks. this shows she is absolute dude hating overkill. if a show like she-hulk got approved i am actually amazed they shut her down. but i am glad. she has no place in the directing field.
hasn t the character thor suffered enough at the hands of marvel films.
actually  i think she probably would have done it better than waititi.
i stopped watching marvel movies back in 2015. i could see where they were going and it wasn t good. the only way out of this mess we are in now is to let the company go bankrupt.
happy valentines week melonie
well if cocaine bear ends up being funny maybe she can do more movies like that ridiculous off the eall movies
that s odd  she would have fit right in with the msheu
i say marvel hire her now and lets watch it implode
none of these directors marvel is hiring nor their writers are fans or have any interest in adapting the source material. they only care about inserting themselves into the stories. when is hollywood gonna promote storytellers rather then narcissists again
she hates on men    why didnt marvel hire her sooner
good video.
to think that she was once slinky linky in zack and miri..
ragnarok was great.  tl t was when they went full-taika.  never go full-taika.
@this is what happens  larry  ragnarok was ok. mediocre and annoying at the same time. def better than dark world tho.  tl   t was an absolute disaster. i actually liked the first movie the best. they hadn t made thor into a doofus and the butt of every joke yet.
i kinda wish she had asked for and directed love and thunder... cause it could have been watchable.  ok  maybe.  nm  probably not.
thor  ragnarok was one of the best marvel movies to me. so i m glad she wasn t anywhere near this one...
7 26 john cena was in deadpool 2   wtf
as many dumb things that disney has done since that time  she almost sounds like a perfect fit now. i m glad she didn t get it either.
at this point   why would the msheu even bother    they might as well just hire her  given the overwhelming incompetence they have lately ...
my question is first off why would you want to join marvel nowadays the chances are you would become an all powerful character with nei reason to why or a bs reason or be a side character that s forgettable or dies within 5 seconds to where we don t care but marvel makes a good once eventually
elizabeth banks is just mad because nobody casted her in a marvel movie
didn t marvel approve the she hulk show which sort of shitted on the fan base
her spouse is max handelman.
what s wrong with tika waititi      keep up the good content tho
favorite women in the kitchen joke....go!
we should stop calling this feminism and call it what it actually is  misandry.
here a good female led action directed by a male director. atomic blonde!
it ll never not be funny she blamed dudes for not seeing her crappy charlie s angels remake...when women didn t go either. just like when billy s what s his name blamed us straights for not supporting his film  and called us homophobic...when his own community ain t go to it either.
she also has a reputation of flopping her movies.
at the bottom it said john cena was cable in deadpool. yup  we are  in a simulation.
watch her forget about katheryn bigelow and say that audiences are misogynistic towards female action directors.
so she s too woke for marvel
ha! i like the adventure time reference instead of using his name in vain. glob is one i use sometimes too  thats a bad habit ive been  working on breaking recently  its harder than i expected
velma finally ends
i don t know why women spend so much money on sunglasses...wouldn t it be cheaper to just tint the kitchen windows!
by  flopping   i assume you mean  sabotage   because that s what she seems to be good at
0 35 is that scientifically proven   idk
i hate the humour in comic movies i want to see some serious one s already.
i decree that she is accepted by marvel.after all hollaback girl.
feminism will truly be the fall of society. we need to start gatekeeping these people out of our hobbies
she great with comedy  but action is not her strong suit.
3 32 the problem for feminists is that it s just another way of saying misandry these days.
just imagine if they would of let her direct thor  he would of lost his powers to valkery making her a better thor an the hulk would of been oppression women while there  and loki would of been a goof ball the whole movie
melanie mac go awesome!
sorry i had to pause the video and look up who she was. i ve seen some of the movies  but i guess i wasn t impressed by them.don t forget to drink water. everyone have a wonderful day.
she appears to be a ragin feminist.  there are other types
waititi f d ragnorok up  he made it a joke  then  doubled down on that  in love   thunder  completely destroying thor. banks probably would have made it worse.
taika waititi isn t much better than her.
ye-ess  women in kitchen jokes can be funny.
oh boy and cool interesting video melonie mac go boom
liz banks s 2019 charlie s angels reboot revealed her to me a flaming misandrist.  it seems marvel studios higher-ups knew this before said fiasco.edit  i meant  ...revealed her to be  .  mea culpa for not checking my spelling.
a shame. i would have loved for her to damage marvel
rejected by a man most likely. lol
cocain bear might be her big shot because every one going to watch it based on name of movie
the outro is skillet right  what is the name of the song
commenting to feed the algorithm
sorry!  melonie mac go awesome!
he s a beta male himself  but as a man  actually had to get work based on his talents and not accusing all your employers as being  sexist.
i find him funny for about fifteen minutes but not two hours.
being a flaming misandrist is a basic job requirement for disney employees  so it must be something else.
price is right fail horn plays
no idea who this is until today
charles angels  coke bear  avengers  rise of kang. normal career arch.
marvel is fine with woke people like banks. clearly. shes just down the list of them to choose from.
the hair in my recommended always gets my attention...
disaster averted.
love you
she would be perfect for some of the garbage marvel has been putting out recently.
so what point is she s trying to make  that major studios are sexist or just have good taste.
cocaine bear looks fun though.
patty jenkins may have directed ww  but she didnt write the story zack snyder did. so more proof that men can write good female lead stories. but she did write the sequel and we know how that went down.
what a pathetic quote  i dont  get approached much about do anything. but that s the thing i m open for business  i m open for business  lol. so would she say she s maybe...not successful at all  sought after  wanted  or liked at all  hahah
cocaine bear finna beat marvel
she is a very good comic actress  but a terrible producer   director.
marvel screwed thor up completely  and he was a clown. the focus should have been on thor and the surtur saga is what should have been adapted  he would have been as popular or more so than iron man. also elizabeth banks is a victim of her own success at failing upwards  she s the no frills version of kathleen kennedy.
elizabeth banks and marvel... hell no!  stay away far away...
thor ragnarok was great  one of my fav mcu ones. love and thunder was trash tho.  glad she didn t make a mcu movie.1st thor is pretty good. for some reason iv watched it quite a bit.
is that the citra 3ds emulator on your taskbar...  wow is it sad that i recognized that...
banks is box office poison. almost everything except maybe the pitch perfect movies that she has a large hand in writing for is absolutely terrible.
elizabeth banks she hates marvel movies and comics and so she did not want to do a character in marvel movies bc she was doing some other project and plus she would think that she won t be a good person to play a character in marvel movies bc she wasn t into marvel characters at all and so that is why she declined of getting a role in marvel movies bc she was going to be doing something else instead of playing a movie role in marvel movies series  ok melonie. anyway that s what i have to say bout this video for yesterday  sunday  and for today  monday   ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great time with your family over the weekend and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed safe trip back home  ok melonie. anyway have a great blessed day today  monday  and god bless you too melonie.
smart move!!!!!!!!! marvel already did eternals  she hulk  love   thunder. now that kangs on the way. marvel has to be on they re shit for the next couple phases.
go boom
elizabeth banks is someone who s famous for reasons i don t know why. like amy schumer. at least mindy kaling comes from a rich family and cheated her way into hollywood. what has elizabeth banks been in  that power rangers movie the odd thing is  i don t even think banks is untalented. she directed that cocaine bear movie coming out and that looks great. but she seems to be her own worse enemy  like feminism to women in general. only 18  of women  all of them living in first world  western countries  and 1  of men consider themselves feminists  but 95  of people believe in equal gender rights.
isn t marvel hating on men just as much  xd
does she say  go poop  or  go boom
she is too woke for the woke.
this would be the only way for marvel to sink any lower. to dial the woke from 10 to 11.
too bad  she was actually very funny  in  scrubs .
banks is a no talent hack.
she didnt sleep with who she had to to get into the mcu. thats how all the other mcu feminists got the green light  only way such people with no talent for the position get the job.
i will say this that female comedy directors do not know anything about male comedy
what happened to your verse of the day
dude  every single shot  and i mean every single shot was f ing green screen in ragnorok. watch it. it s beyond annoying.
i would think marvel would hire her anyways then bc all their stuff is turning to crap
i used to like her... but like many  i have to cross another off my people i like list...... just go boom
uhm... as actress she should do her job. not try to influence the movie. a lot of this people seem to be narcissists. thinking they are the best at everything. entertainment always is about what the people you want to entertain like. narcissists can be ok actors. but you see  how they fail as writers and directors. they make it about themself. and it s like always with narcissists  everything is others fault. if people aren t entertaint by the annoying  arrogant  evil narcissist  they are fault and have to change. narcissists shouldn t try something like that. they can be annoying actors  but pls  nothing that requires creativity. you will just get the narcissist and his or her  enemies  from rl. it s just awful
she  believes a call was made   how is that even trying  after a call that might not have ever happened  she wasn t contacted  by that standard  she was  rejected  by marvel  by that standard  so was i. i  believe  a phone call was made  and i didn t hear anything back either. this is an article to market hiring an incompetent female director. i know  redundant.
should change her name to elizabeth blanks because all the movies she shoot are blanks. she is shooting blanks movies.
i love elizabeth banks. but she s not a fit for a marvel film
the only movies i saw her in besides power rangers were the hunger games movies.
we have icons like amy schumer to thank for setting that trend.
if the director is good at filmmaking and storytelling  we don t give a crap about their gender or race. why can t hollywood do the same
it can t be her thoughts on men since they see us as trash in movies now. men get beat up by women in all the mcu  she would be a hero.
who
analytics
thank the fck they didn t call her backragnarok was imo one of the three best marvel filmswhat a ruin it could ve been  worse than asgard
hey pretty melonie  so miss banks wanting to enter marvel and it says no thanks. also actors and actres dont represent their acting the real person many times suck.
every thor movie is still bad anyway
ragnarok was a funny movie but bad thor movie. i would assume if banks directed  it would just be bad.
clearly what we need is a man pretending to be a woman directing these films so women can advance in the field.
hot take  ragnarok and love thunder are equally garbage
yes but marvel just sucks anyway and i would not have said this 5 years ago.
angry feminists and the simps who join their clubs looking for an easy score.
i m sick of superhero movies and shows
she s not a very good actress but she has asserted herself into the sjw woke culture by means of producing and directing horrible movies. that charlie s angels reboot was terrible. people need to stop giving her jobs.
marvel doesn t deserve your support
women action movies when done right can t be pretty badass. peppermint was badass so was lucy
ragnar k.
did i hear you say patty jenkins did a good job on ww 84 that movie was terrible. your credibilty is now in question.
as an actress  i enjoy banks.  but as a director  she is terrible based on her movies  and from a political perspective  makes me want to vomit.
that s a hot take
@josh 032  yes  most people loved ragnarok
@idawg  ragnarok was a poor take on two different stories put together  it definitely felt lazy once you look past the surface.
@lvthor ascending  like i said i hated both mainly for the humor. but most people did like ragnarok
ah yes  the liberal white knight tactic. as amusing as it is obvious lol.
you misheard. she said only the first one.
i like e banks per pitch perfect movies and slither.    but if she directed the charlie s angel s reboot     no thx.    ewww.   talk about terrible.
hi it mel
why  she flops everytime. that s  marvel  msheu
still wouldn t help ragnarok. the mcu suckssss
slither was such a dumb movie.
