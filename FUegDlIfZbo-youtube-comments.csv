never apologize  never bend the knee  because it is never enough.
hogwarts legacy isn t a game  it s a character test. and a lot of people are about to fail it.  - yeah i always hoped i d be sorted into ravenclaw  but deep down i fear i d end up in hufflepuff.
i am playing the    t out of this game as soon as i can  and i will enjoy every second and i hope my fellow streamers and just gamers all enjoy !! . one love to everyone    ! we are wizards harry !! xd
i was just ignoring this drama until i heard about the woman who was fired from limited run games. this has gone too far. my heart goes out to her i ve seen some of the interviews she s done and she seems like a lovely person  completely undeserving of the shit she got.
we should all stream hogwarts legacy together  they cant stop us all
it s not about kindness or what s right  it s about control.
once you start letting people bully you into changing  it ll never stop. always be true to yourself melonie. i m not a streamer  but i preordered the game and i m looking forward to melonies streams of it.
if anyone gets upset for others playing a video game  they won t survive in the real world
the funny part about it  is that not playing the game has absolutely no effect on jk it only really effects the design team and studio  which likely has very little to do with jk herself.
only watched two of your vids so far  and i have to say i am very impressed! thank you for standing up for yourself and most of all....being true to yourself for your beliefs! so refreshing. always take the narrow path and you will be rewarded.
really happy i found your main channel about 2 years ago   it s cool to see you branch out on this channel which i guess now can be considered your main  lol thank you for the  content   work you put into your videos  you re awesome melonie keep doing your thing  subscriber for life here  t s cool to see someone with similar views   a more raw unfiltered take on current events  no pandering  just keeping it real with the viewers.
i know some people are getting the game just to combat the crazy.  people who aren t big followers of the franchise.  i agree  if you allow these people to control your choices then they will keep pushing for more and more control.  it would be nice if these people would see the hypocrisy of what they re doing because if the tables were turned they would lose their minds.
when everyone is cancelled  no one is cancelled.
this is great we will now see who is woke  who easily bends the knee  who stood up and those who don t care. cancelling is a form of bullying.
thank you for this. we need more fearless people in the gaming sphere. subscribed!
this is my first video from you  and i m in awe of how genuine and authentic you were in this video. i don t see this very often on youtube. just subscribed!
i completely agree. nobody has any power to control what you do. nor do you need to appease them because you want to play something that they hate.
don t worry about it melonie  we will love you more if you put out videos on it. we need our news.
they don t have enough  cancel  bullets to take everyone down. hopefully the influencers and other streamers will stand their ground. this is just ridiculous.
love your video! just found your channel. nice to see someone who doesn t do as they re told! lol rules for not getting canceled is 1. don t care2. don t apologize
just ignore and live your life is the best option as appeasing them never works
ya easier said when they lose their channels for it... something needs to be done tho
not only because it s not enough but because it s stupid to apologize for playing a video game
exactly never enough
what is sad about all of this is that they went from just wanting acceptance to demanding others to obey them. and the few bad apples that push this behavior  give the whole community a bad reputation.
@shinozaki6239  no it is not just   a few bad apples   it is like  95 of them.it is never enough.
dude! that was perfectly said! you are so true!
jeremy clarkson is learning that lesson as we speak.
one day we ll be free!!!
@trevorrawlins6025  this.
paying taxes is bending the knee
even better  if you want to bend the knee  make sure that your knee damages your opponent s head.
@majandrafan  well....i mean...if you want paved roads  a place to flush your turds to  and your kids to have a school to go to...then  ok
of all tyrannies  a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. it would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. the robber baron s cruelty may sometimes sleep  his cupidity may at some point be satiated  but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.    c.s. lewis
proved by jeremy clarkson recently. apologised twice still potentially having his contract not renewed next year
correct  it will never ever be enough so it s easier to just ignore and move on.
it all happened when they started to accept gay lesbian people i don t have a problem do what make you happy but don t force your opinion or beliefs on other they turn into a mad king they want more and more
@maddworld3317  never done it never. if you try to reason with lunatics you become a lunatic. just lose your channel much better than loosing your integrity. life is not over
their morals  their code  it s a bad joke. dropped at the first sign of trouble. twitter is only as good as the world allows them to be.
@saltycat666  but if creators do play the game  they can lose their channels... for some of them it s their only means of income.  we can want them to defy susan here but i can see why they wouldn t play hogwarts
@maddworld3317  that would be incredibly weirdlosing your channel for playing a game
@dsmith3279  maybe but is this game worth it to keep your large channel  income    following    i d do it on another site like others do here.  start your stream here then lead them over to the other site
@saltycat666  i thought that s what this insinuated   that you d lose a channel  maybe i didn t hear this right.
@maddworld3317  if that s the dude i m thinking of  i loved get him to the greek  i watch odins men.    and i m honestly just tired of the this apocalyptic level threat being normalized. if you want to dress up that s cool but expecting others to bend to rules that don t exist  effect them  and if you don t agree with them your ph bic and you have to dance around words to not have your comment removed. i wish i could see the future  i don t want to be live  for it age won t allow   but i just want to witness what happens if we don t get back on track to  reality.rambled a bit there.
you sniveling dorks are so dramatic
agreed. they will always find something to bash you on. and if they won t put money towards something that someone owns for opinions that person has  they wouldn t be able to buy anything without cancelling themselves.anyone that has to go on the internet and demand people not to play a game are insane and really need to figure out what went wrong in their lives that sent them down this path. cause it s nothing but toxic
@fclefjefff4041  it s not dramatic though. the same guy that brought the world critical theory wrote an essay called repressive tolerance calling for the complete subjugation of wrong think. it never being enough is an integral part of the woke philosophy.
gamers against groomers gag
i m pretty sure that was jesus christ himself who said never apologize. like i get what people are saying that s a really stupid comment people make. i apologize if you do something wrong. don t apologize if you didn t do anything wrong  especially to bad people. sure apologize to friends and family if you hurt their feelings even if they are in the wrong because you love them and sometimes that s the right thing to do. but don t apologize to bad people because you are doing the right thing and not participating in something that is wrong  but always apologize when you did something wrong. never apologize is it incredibly immoral and irrational thing to say and i don t get why people keep saying it. i m not going to assume the context.
@mech0p820  do you know i agree with that in all circumstances but that s easy for us to say because none of us are essentially celebrities or influencers. you can all say you would participate exactly the same as you would now  but you don t know it until you re in the situation. when you are a more public figure  the things you say and agree with  and do need to be more tactile. you do have to think about the criticisms because you have so many people watching you and getting ready to not support you if you actually are doing something wrong. again  we are all on a youtube channel where it s about fighting back against this kind of behavior. most people who are celebrities or public personalities or influencers aren t involved in this kind of politics. they are so much more neutral. they aren t even involved in this world enough to know the issues and know if they are doing something that is wrong. i ve definitely said or done things that i thought were funny or even accurate or perfectly acceptable and then you get a lot of backlash and you kind of realize  oh  maybe that was an appropriate thing to say or do and it s good to apologize. definitely people should not be apologizing about playing harry potter because someone who created the universe doesn t think a man can become a woman lol
@maddworld3317  exactly dude. these people don t have anything to lose the key  pretending to be brave. you aren t brave for doing something and not being afraid because it doesn t affect you either way. how many of these warriors in the comment section would actually lose their jobs. they have a good job outside of just being customer service at walmart for standing up for these beliefs  not only that  how many of these people would lose an absolute dream job and give it up to take these stances  one out of 1000. one out of 1000 that are watching this video and commenting about never apologize and you can say  if you apologize  they will eat you if you stand your ground  they won t. they eat people all the time they don t apologize. and that s just the stories you hear. i m sure thousands of people in america a month faced something like this lose their job and it ruins their life at least makes it significantly harder for a long period of time and they have nothing to show from it.. i like to think i would do the right thing  but none of us know until we re in that position and none of us are probably ever going to be in that position. it s like saying in the apocalypse and the end of time i would never screw over innocent people to protect myself. to say  i would never hurt innocent people if it meant  that was the only way i could be protected. maybe not. but until you re starving in the apocalypse  and the only way is to take the food from other people  hypothetically  you don t know what you re going to do  when you have a family to feed in a dream job and you re going to lose your job because you posted something about transgender people on facebook and they say you need to take that down and take a few hours of a course about sensitivity training or they re going to have to fire you and you just moved across the country with your family and your kids for a dream job. it s a once in a lifetime opportunity  i bet you  1 million. most of these people are taking that post down and doing a few hour courses and answering some questions lol so everyone is a get off of this don t apologize ever because sometimes you should apologize and most of you guys are going to die on your sword and sacrifice all this just to stand your ground  but nobody is going to see it happen. stop pretending like this is always on a platform and you get millions of people to applaud you for doing the right thing. that s not hard to do. getting applauded for millions of people because your story is really famous  is not hard to do. that s the easy thing to do. to have everyone who believes like you support you and apply for you  that s easy. do it in the dark  sacrifice everything and let there really be no impact for the movement possibly and by possibly i mean 99.99999  likely. this stuff happens to people all the time and they don t get praise for doing the right thing and they lose everything. you guys have nothing to lose  and neither do i for the most part i m not pretending to be better  i m just not in my safe place on the internet with everybody agreeing with me already  claiming what i would do
@shinozaki6239  the a few bad apples  you mean the vast vast majority  lol i should say the vast majority to have any sort of influence or authority and support the lgbtq community  you mean like pretty much every democrat politician  every corporation  every social media platform  almost every celebrity in the music and film industry and almost every gaming journal  it s clear you just support the transgender movement because there s no way someone could try and downplay it to being a few bad apples. so that s my problem when people try to say it s both sides or try to actually conflate the radical left with the radical right. like it s not comparable the amount of crazy people in congress or they have influence the support  left-wing ideas and support right wing ideas.
@majandrafan  nah. it s not. don t get me wrong  i don t agree with most taxes  and especially how they are spent but that s not the same and you aren t fighting the government on spending taxes anyways so stop pretending like you are. even if you are invading taxes it s just because you can get away with it. you wouldn t actually  make the choice to go to prison or pay attacks right in front of you and everyone else please so don t pretend like you re being a hero. everyone pretends like they aren t bending the knee and they are standing up against tyranny when they aren t and they have nothing to lose. you guys  we are all in the comment section on youtube. everyone get off your high horse and quit pretending like you re doing anything in. i believe a lot of you guys would stand up to him versus the sacrifices it was necessary for the opportunity arose. but i get skeptical when you pretend like you re doing it as we speak and you aren t.
@jesse4473  right     i understood this  rule  to mean you will either take strikes for each time you play hogwarts on your chan or just deleted if you dare to try it.yes  it s real easy to tell everyone who depends on this for income to just get removed when they aren t losing anything by it   i highly doubt the majority would attempt it if those are the terms.all they have to do is lead people here to other sites where they can play for hours without losing their y t chan.
@maddworld3317  these lunatics don t have the power that they think they have and that they have convinced others that they have.  if we are cowards this will never end and will only get worse.
exactly their like little kids who cry when they don t get what they want
not only because its never enough but because bending the knee to evil is wrong. its our moral duty to shun evil.
@christisgreaterthanculture9255
@maddworld3317  i don t politics like at all.it s a bot fest
it s pretty much crazy
double down and go harder.
@saltycat666  my best friend is trans and he complains about the way these people act. don t get me wrong there are some really cool trans people it then there are also the crazy ones
just call me sleepyhead cause i ain t wooken
@cynthiahembree3957  yes i have cool friends too but it became a cult and a religion at this point
@maddworld3317  no one loses their channel  the people that try to cancel others are not even fans to begin with lol
@shinozaki6239  reminds me of a group that started in 1920 s and changed shift in the 1930 s.
this.
so  you would if it was enough
this is terrible advice. one should know where their  line  is  sure. but you should also have the presence of mind to question your own lines at every turn. there is no room for growth in a person who refused to reflect on their own ideals and beliefs. the biggest critic to yourself should be you.
@krimzonghost1987  tell that to the other side
@hivedragon  i do  when i am presented with a circumstance to do so. i don t generally subscribe to the concept of polarity in my day to day life. my main metric that i measure a persons opinion on is whether or not they actively question it. if you are a liberal and do not question your opinions  then your opinion can t stand because you have not put it through real stress. the same goes for conservatives  or any political stance for that matter. ideas  ideals and beliefs should be questioned incessantly regardless of their origins. left  right  heaven or hell  question it until you run out of questions... then write some new ones.
@krimzonghost1987  well good luck then  there are a lot of people who are selective in hearing no matter what.
there is no possible redemption in the woke worldview. once a sinner  always a sinner. best course of action is to call them out for their manipulation  authoritarian tendencies  double standards and word games. make it very clear that you will never capitulate.
@prokofny  to quote churchill   we will never surrender.
@prokofny  i don t mean to split hairs  but if you want to criticize someone for  manipulation  and  authoritarian tendencies   maybe don t start off by comparing people who think differently than you with  sinners . that whole vibe comes off as a bit authoritarian in it s own right.
@krimzonghost1987  what i meant to imply was that the woke think those who do not think like them are sinners. i said that there is not redemption in the woke worldview  not that the woke are beyond redemption.
@krimzonghost1987  progressive   liberal   liberal progressive   authoritarian tendencies   woke
1.5 million preorders on steam alone. also ps 5 is dam close to that amount as well as xbox one. with those numbers it s obvious the whiners didn t influence anyone.
@maddworld3317  no one will lose their channel over this  most people watching people don t care.
@nathr7375  i understand that but i heard someone say that y t was going to remove chans if they played hogwarts.  so ya i would have never thought that without someone saying that was a rule once the game released.
once you bend your knee they want your head
@maddworld3317  they won t
@ljessecusterl its like that old book   if you give a mouse a cookie
never apologize  never bend the knee  because it is never enough wrong to cater to the will of insane people.
@dinglemccrinkleberry2463  i don t know what that means but i would give the mouse a cookie bc i love animals too much
@nathr7375  i m happy to hear that!!
yeah  that s what the trans community and allies are doing.
@mech0p820  too bad now many people will do that
i even didn t try
great life advice will take it to the grave
or double down. but do not keep going down to the bottom or thats gonna be the deepest grave to be dug
@tanimal3964  he got canceled tho for saying he wished markle would get paraded through every village in britain naked and have feces thrown at her. i ve watched that guy and his team for decades  loved them....his farm show was my fav show on amazon....but that was too much even for me.
if a streamer gets cancelled by the small percentage of woke population consider it a blessing!!!!!not a huge harry potter fan but will buy this game just to piss off the woke!!
put some respect on hufflepuff
let s get the talking hat out and find out who are the rejects.
nah hufflepuff is where all the people who hate this game ended up in
it s not even a game worth even buying
oh i m going to play it just to be evil haha
as a hufflepuff i am offended and will promptly be callin on the woke army to cancel you ... jk  rowling  as a puff i m used to being made fun of but you will regret it if you ever want the good food or the good weed - just sayin  d
@miraclemira  xd well damn stuck on that gryffindor weed now... wanted to be a ravenclaw so bad but the hat choose gryff  .
listen  come puff with the huffles. we don t bite.
you do realise all 4 were some of the greatest wizards to ever live durring there time

hufflepuff allday!!!
hey i got hufflepuff and have never bent the knee.
i m classified as hufflepuff but i have an inkling that new potterheads who play this game will be a shoo-in for gryffindor.
don t sell yourself short. you re a ravenclaw. your self-awareness of maybe not being ravenclaw enough  is exactly what makes you a ravenclaw.
knowing my luck i d be a squib
a woke individual during the test.  the hat assign them to ravenclaw. excuse me  did you just assume my house  i identify myself as a hufflepuff  this is housephobic!
@user-tk4br3ux4s  hufflepuff life!
@tenryuu  conformists will be gryffindor
@bobbyhill6193  what game is then
same man  did the test and was put into hufflepuff  lmao
hey  hufflepuffs are particularly good finders.  5 points to your house if you know the reference.
@tenryuu  i got sorted as a gryffindor on the hogwarts legacy app. i quickly switched to hufflepuff
@ndihrkop  respect. i too am a good finder.
hey now
you look like draco malfoy
i feel you i feel in my heart that i m full slytherin but i m scared the hat  will put me in hufflepoff as well just to diss me
@bobby hill  i already paid for it cod is a game not worth buying
this whole debate has made me feel like i might want to become a slytherin
a have a male charakter  who protect femal childs to lady.lovely j.k.rowling  a nice women with strong eggs.
@williamdrum9899  lol
@williamdrum9899   bro im a hufflepuff and i love harry potter
@miraclemira   ayyy we puffs got to stick together
yeah sure you can join the cowards im just gonna be chillin with my fellow hufflepuffs
@wjumeau  you dont understand what us puffs stand for we are  chefs.nurses paramedics doctors we value hardwork and loyalty without us the world wouldnt be plus where will you silly slytherns be without your hufflebuddy
@williamdrum9899  are you serious  i pre-ordered the deluxe edition of hogwarts legacy and my personality fits with hufflepuff.
@krane97  it s a joke
@williamdrum9899  that hurts because if i end up there then i have to align... . if you can t join them then you gotta beat them. oh wait that might be wrong  i m not sure i m so confused with life now .
@bobbyhill6193  it is now! you can find out who you truly are if you take the test
same my dude same that is my ultimate fear i only want to be ravenclaw haha
that was funny.
@bobbyhill6193  how do you know its open world and what i have seen with game play its pretty awesome.
aint nothing wrong with that mate  hufflepuff is a great house to be in although i prefer slytherin.
i answered honestly and got sorted into gryffindor  spelling
that s nice i may not be a huge harry potter fan but i did thought the movies were okay and i do love the idea of creating your own characters in video games so i m a give this game a chance
if u pre-order it u get early access on february 7 for 72 hour s i m ready are you ready and i hope the top dog youtubers like markiplier and jack and wade and bob and cartoonz and h20 etc will play it
i hope they play it i enjoy they re content . but yes pre-ordered and waiting very impatiently xd even started watching the movies just to burn time ...can t wait !
@tiege_gaming  i been watching the old harry potter games on ps1 and ps2 long playthrough
i m not really a gamer. and i m not a super harry potter fan. but i cannot wait for this game! i m so excited! i have preordered and took next week off work starting on the 7th just to play!!
hahahahaha go outside incel
i m in
this is a true statement but also partially false.  they can t stop us all  applies when you re actually doing something wrong.here it s not even accurate to say  they can stop one of us.  no they can t.
play hogwarts legacy  lets see them wizards  they cant attack us all 2023   had to make a joke about the area 51 raid
you may have my wand !
exactly.
i thought woke activism was about love and inclusivity  and yet all these people do is hate and exclude.
lol
holy crap...
the only way to deal with bully s is by facing them. usually they don t even know how to react to that.
well said
remember when bullying was as issue   guess it s not any more ! especially if you have an agenda.
stop preordering games..i dont know how anyone still doesnt this after all of the terrible releases.
@nothingisawesome
i m  going to pre-order it  but don t know if on pc or xbox series s.
@loveletters  i only pre-order after reviews come out. usually the day before.   then i can judge whether or not i want it. and still get the pre order bonus crap if i do.
@nothingisawesome  who cares honestly
especially as they distanced her from the game to save any outrage
i assume she still receives royalties since it s her ip
@mrmistah1588  which is like fractions of pennies on a sale  i think the very low percentages that she will actually make are very little compared to the millions she already made has. depending on the contract she likely already made her money
@stevenharper7118  but she still will make millions  its her game after all her life work  doesnt matter if she didnt work on it its her world
@azurie580  she is already a billionaire regardless of whether you buy this game or not.
@stevenharper7118  yeah whoever thinks that she not getting a single penny from this game would even make a dent to her finances is unbelievably naive. 10 huge hollywood movies  hugely successful bookseries sold all across the world and practically an insurmountable amount of harry potter merchandise vs. license earnings of a videogame made entirely by someone else.the amount of hate and harrassment they have put out into the world has made tons more harm and i m sure even their cause has gained more enemies than turned anyone to be sympathetic to their pressuring  do what we want or else  hate tactics.it is a campaign of hate. which in itself is incredibly ironic.meanwhile  j.k. rowling has set up a human shelter. yes  for biological women  but she has set up a humane shelter ... yet her efforts to help out some is not seen as a net positive  but instead she is seen as a monster for all the people she failed to help.despite there also being the obvious thing that women who need such shelters often need them due to domestic issues and can have traumas revolving around men and could use peer support from women. while i believe trans women are women and they have my sympathy if they have a mismatch between their brain and body  i do believe that only a biological woman can truely relate to the lived life experience about her body  self-esteem and all from another biological peer.equally  i wish trans people can have shelters for trans only  if they have suffered traumas relating to non-trans people being bigots or so. it can be a valuable option for peer support.no to mention how j.k.rowling  a woman  probably is allowed to have an opinion about being a woman.not that i d agree with her  but she doesn t need to be de-platformed and mobbed either.but no  crucify her  smother her in hate and everyone else in hate and harrassment too  who is even moderately  guilty by association  through a game.i have seen these boycotters be infinitely more aggressive and hateful than jkr.sorry for the wall of text...i m just honestly fuming at all of this. my sympathy has never ran so low.
@sarkasmi83  that s cool. i can t read good.. but that s cool..
i also preordered the game  and not just the standard the deluxe!
i refuse to stream the game not because it does or doesn t harm gay people but because liking harry potter is in and of itself gay
@anonstreasures  no it s not. if you think that then don t comment. lol
@anon s trunk of treasures  ha! i don t agree  but i appreciate the joke.
@anonstreasures  that s some classy old trollin my friend
@nothingisawesome  maybe because steam allows refunds
@anonstreasures  i ll pretend that somehow remotely made any sense  let alone correlates to how playing a game about a magic school has anything to do with being gey in of itself.  now if it was about a game where gey material is involved  then your comment would made much more sense. but nice bait mate  i rate 0 8.
yeah..... but  at the same time  i d say 90  of streamers ain t doing it cause they  think it s fun.   they doing it for the views  follows and revenue.  they re profiting off it more than they re having fun.  or... money is fun.  take your pick.
so they re going to bully people into not playing the game and if you do play then they re going to try to have you canceled  what does that tell you about these people  if you let people bull you it will never stop. put a spotlight on these cockroaches and hold them accountable for there actions.
@acemax1124  in all honesty  the only thing this whole controversial situation about a video game getting canceled or not over a political view made by the creator of the franchise the game is based off of only tells me just how much power these wokesters have behind the scenes that we are simply unaware of. and the worst part about it all  is we are losing  or rather  on the receiving end of being  ran through  by all this woke insanity that we can t have anything that is good  or remotely fun anymore. these are the times we are living in now. and going up against these woke individuals have never ended well for anyone. all the more reason to loathe this pathetic world we are living in. where people can t even put their political views aside and enjoy a video game for what it simply is  a game.
@truthseeker7406  books are gay  in a derogatory way  and spawned an absolutely insufferable fan base content to settle for the on average sub-par writing not to mention added heavily to the rising tide of adult children  this isn t really a fault of the book and more society but it sours me to the franchise regardless so all in all  not bait  mate . also use  gay  what are you an african tv host
you are right. give them one inch today  they will take another later  and another.it has been a hot debate in the warhammer 40k community about retconning the lore to allow female space-marines lately. i realized most of the gatekeepers are actually not as opposed to it as they claim. it s the idea of giving an inch to the narcissists that demand it that does not sit well with them.
they accusing us of doing to them what they are doing to us
@nothingisawesome  there you go telling people what to do.
@nothingisawesome  depends  sometimes the preorder bonus can be worth the risk but yeah.
@debbierobbins360   they re trying to warn you. pre-ordering games is a mistake because they release games perfectly fine  wait for glowing reviews to pour in  and then censor it into intolerability. unless the game is completely sequestered from any sort of cloud update system  never preorder. if you do anyway  it s your money to gamble  but you were warned.
@anonstreasures  i agree
this
syndrome is love
its un un canceled
@-huracan-8444  the villain from the incredibles
exactly  this game is gonna be huge. its pre-order sales alone show its gonna be a big big release. they can t stop this game  it s gonna be way too popular. i ll love watching them cry like the babies they are when literally everyone is playing it  streaming it.
yup  they will cancel you for being canceled !!!
@mrkevin486  play  yes. stream  i don t know about that. if these wokesters have a handling on how yt operates  then you can forget about it streaming. let alone sharing what you enjoy about the game as videos of anything related gets canceled and taken down by yt s ridiculous policies.
@hakimshaberdashery  double negation ... when people try to cancel u  u cancel their cancellation
@hakimshaberdashery  yes
so doesn t it all be canceled
tim pool said something like this a little while ago - the only defence against cancel culture is herd immunity. when it gets to the point where everyone s been cancelled over some impossibly tiny thing - everyone is just gonna stop caring.
@morrigan eris le fay  that s why you don t stream on youtube. if twitch blocks it  then facebook  if not there  then rumble... and of course there s always only fans....lol
@aklitorose8079  my comment failed to follow the golden rule of the internet - if someone can put an autistically over-literal interpretation on what you said  someone  will . yes - obviously not every single last person needs to have been the subject of a cancellation campaign for this idea to work. only a critical mass.
enough with this cancel culture mess. who is getting canceled  you guys just keep on falling for these right - wing grifts smh
me thinks this one doesn t know what cancelled means.
there is no i in team griff.  yeah  there s no u either. so i guess if i m not on the team and you re not on the team  nobodies on the god damn team! the team sucks! - red vs blue
it s high time people start telling the moralists that their entitled  borderline narcissistic zeal does not actually make their opinions any more relevant than anyone elses.
woke...
its sorta like.... magic....i ll see myself out
the emperor has no clothes moment.
i m fairly sure this aggressive outrage trend will reach the point where tons of people will just snap and decide  no more  and stop trying to cater to anyone and they have at best managed to create more angry people that oppose them rather than sympathize with them.such aggression these social justice people display is bound to be face with similar behavior eventually.at least i m noticing that no matter how much i d try to live my life trying to be as respectful as humanly possible  the demands just get greater and i am still accused of being this and that.just being cis  i m evil. i can t understand. i need to become an ally and serve in a way people want me to or i m transfobic. just being white  i m priviliged  entitled  arrogant  evil. just being male i m toxic and need to shut up as i can t know hardship. just by hoping characters would be accurate to the source material  i m racist  like when i hoped i would ve seen one of my favorites  domino  be portrayed in a comic book accurate way on the big screen.  except when i m against a dark character being replaced with a white one - again hoping for character accuracy.. then i m ok just by drinking a tall glass of chocolate milk from nestle  i m irresponsible  part of all of the planets problems...and now  just by playing a videogame  i m transphobic and deserve harrassment of all magnitudes.i will wait for the next one. for already being labeled a horrible person  i feel like maybe it d be easier to just start acting like a horrible person.maybe it would be freeing. as trying to be understanding and nice and caring sure isn t causing nothing but anxiety.
yes. i don t care what virtue they claim to be the cause  this whole campaign is a campaing of hate  harrassment and bullying in function.
thank you so much
i believe you re right.  time for common sense to regain control.
i m not a big streamer  but i don t subscribe to being cancelled. this game will be covered on my channel. i have a great community and moderators that are fantastic. i m certainly not trying to incite the haters  but i ll deal with them if they come.
@draco.invictus  im definitly not big lmao  but im gonna stream early access as well. can t wait!
@ultimatebreak827  fantastic! enjoy the game with your viewers.
@draco.invictus  thank you!
define  enough  because this is not for the big streamers that everyone will come forward to defend. this is a message for all those  nobodys  with 50 people watching them  get in line or get the boot  its the carrot and the stick
all i know is that once the game goes live i ll be streaming it day one of my 72 hour early access on the 7th.
@charison22  same the second that it unlocks i ll be live on my gaming channel!
those that do will see an increase in their numbers and those who bend the knee will see people leave
asmongold will play it so you will have thousands of people watching him
exactly they cant really cancel shit anymore.
i find it so crazy that they can try to control people not to buy this game. i m not only going to review it  i might even do a full play through
brianna wu talking about the character of any other person is the most hilarious part of this whole thing.
i m about to stan this game so hard. and we all know why.
as long as twitch  or other platforms  itself isn t going to ban people for streaming it  which actually is a possibility  knowing their  safety  council   i don t think anyone s getting cancelled over it. it ll likely get them more viewers.i agree btw  it is a character test. and a lot of easily manipulated wussies are going to fail it. not enough to make a dent  though.
all this makes me want to play it even more
meanwhile  outside of the twitterverse  thousands of harry potter fans and gamers loaded up the game and had a good time.
i just want to say well said! i have never watched you or any of your vids before  but i have been looking forward to the game for a while and think its ridiculous for someone else to have the right to tell me what i can and cannot play. i appreciated your views  and agree with them 100 . just want to say thankyou for being open and honest and standing up for yourself and encouraging others to do the same. thank you!
one of the funny things about this to me is back in the day  it was the angry mob who made liking harry potter their entire personality
wait a minute  this is the first i am hearing exactly why the game  looks bad  because  i have been on a social media break for a bit. coming back this was instantly one of the things i saw  hogwarts legacy and why you shouldnt get it  or  this game looks bad . this is a game i legitimately want to play and seeing all the negative headlines had me concerned that it was actually a bad or disappointing game and was going to be another let down of a game like  anthem  or  callisto protocol   those 2 still hurt by the way .but you mean to tell me.... the game itself isnt whats bad.... its the lgbt community that is saying supporting it is bad       i mean seriously       now we cant even play video games    i swear they get so damn tiring  you want to support them until they start to do stuff like this. i mean we are grown people who can make our own decisions. let us decide if the game is bad  the same way we all found out velma is bad  not just because you tell people because of your infuriated views. anyways  so i guess i will be gettin hogwarts legacy and determine for myself if the game is actually bad. smh  jesus christ. cant even play video games anymore. something we use to escape reality for an hour or two  especially us working and tired adults who dont have a lot of time in the day to do everything they want. we use games to escape reality and now these angry folks want to try to push reality into our escape from it    i mean how messed up is that     playing a game does not mean you dont have support from someone! it means they are a fan of that franchise and want to make it a part of their collection!
i m so tired. i just need to remember the best way to deal with this is to not engage. don t watch videos on it  don t read comments on it  don t look at tweets about it. my time is so much more valuable spent being happy than going though all these random thoughts that i m a bad person for enjoying a game. i wish you all much happiness and comfort in your life. i m going to try to be better about avoiding videos like this because it just adds kindling to the fire and makes me focus on it more.
i love the fact that the lotr and harry potter fans are the ones willing to fight against this woke nonsense.  melonie  fellow viewers  keep fighting and god bless you all with excellence!!
loved this video  thank you for what you are doing!
thanks for having the courage to being yourself.  it s terrible how even industries are scared to offend the perpetual whiners.  go boom!
i m so glad i got this preordered  we will be streaming it asap
thinking of getting a streaming set up just to start with this game. with all the big ones getting threatened and most of them listening..it might be a good one to start streaming with.
honestly it s hurting the people who s careers their families lives hang on the line
these people are absolutely nuts. this crusade to expose and cancel anyone that has a differing opinion of them is so far gone.like do they realize that every single product they consume  whether it be food  clothes  entertainment  their car  house  the coffee machine they just bought...everything...likely had someone involved in its production that has a differing opinion of them
it makes me want to stream hogwarts legacy  as someone who stream once every few years   and see if the two things happen first  how fast i get falsely reported for bs for playing or get put on list because a group of  journalist  feel they are the arbiters of the internet and must keep a list of whose streaming in that category.
i had never heard of this game before this controversy. now it s on my wishlist for when it goes on sale at markdown
honestly i just found your channel and i love it. i am a member of the lgbtq community and i am getting this game and i can t wait!
all the negativity made my friend i game share with preorder the deluxe edition
@joefiser9393  lol ..it s almost here. i can t wait
it s having the opposite effect   pre-orders are going through the roof
@michaeldavies7949  it shows people are tired of others trying to control them  especially for a video game
i got the deluxe edition just to give them the finger that much more. first time i ve ever bought anything other than standard.
ikr  still trying to live off the grift of gamergate
muted brianna long ago  she was ranting about rowling and it became tiresome  to say the least.
you know her giving money to people who quote hitler really makes me wanna give money
@tracey9888  what
how dare they have fun  said every far left troll...lawsuits we need lawsuits!
@tubebammy so that s why people are saying bad things about this game. i m not a hard core fan of harry potter but i love the world and the idea of making a character set in this world i think it s awesome especially since i have a wizarding world account and my profile on that can be put in the game is even more awesome makes me think i m actually in the world.to make a long story short i m getting this game and i m gonna have fun playing it  but i will still support the lgbtq community but they shouldn t have any say on what franchise i can and can t enjoy.
you forgot the the witcher and the wheel of time fans. they also made quite some noise.
let the fellowshop grow against the evil madness.
warhammer fans under attack now from woke rejects. fighting back!
because all those things are literally stories about people banding together against evil orcs sorcerers or witches empires  so it translates very well to the situation
even if their fandom isn t so masive like tlotr or the witcher ones  don t forget about  cowboy bebop     resident evil  fanbase stood their ground against the woke cultists.or how we call it here in my country   no se dejaron copar la parada .
arch rivals setting aside differences to stand against the true dark lords.
@samuraiedge2619  resident evil is a much larger franchise than witcher. i don t count internet  most of internet are bots. i look more at total sales figures   brand awareness. in the usa i come across way more people who know what re is due to the movies   games.
rings of power isn t that woke ffs  it s like people are angry that galadriel is powerful or something  we already knew she was powerful.
@iforgot87872  if you say so wokeist.
@andrewmanook  what s so bad about rings of power seriously  that it has a few black people  why is that a bad thing who really cares about the race of the cast.i don t like when movies have heavy handed far-left messaging either  i just happen to disagree that rings of power is a major example of that kind of propaganda.
deeper the lore  more passion defending it.
@iforgot87872  in the books and the peter jackson movies  galadriel is powerful because she s good at magic and diplomacy  not because she s a sword swinging karen.
@iforgot87872  galadriel is supposed to be well measured and wise  not an angry teenager. she s one of the most powerful magic users in the entire lotr universe.
@thebeastch  can t they start the character in a place and have her evolve what s kareny about her  also- how is any of this related to wokeness  wouldn t it be more woke if she wasn t flawed
@johnathon007  the character can evolve over time- also- none of this is related to wokeness by the way which was the main issue being discussed here.
@iforgot87872  if they wanted the character to evolve they should have started 500 or more years earlier. and wokeness is exactly what causes this. they can t just have a good strong female character  they have to turn them into mockeries of what they see as toxic masculinity. its the exact same thing they did with she hulk.
@i4got872 ytp  look at her behavior  talking down to people constantly  even the fucking queen  and demanding things. if that s not kareny  i don t know what a karen is. and that s not depicted as a flaw. it s depicted as her being right and her being badass. and when she eventually gets her way  it s depicted as a good thing. either way  don t let me talk you out of liking what you like  even if i don t like it.
@i4got872 ytp  and if they did have her evolve as a character over time  give her an arc  it would have been even better than if she was as we know her all along. thing is  over the entire season  she didn t change one bit  and i didn t see any hints that she will.
@iforgot87872  no dude. people are angry because she sucks.
@thebeastch  sauron s not gonna fight himself. she knows he s out there. it made sense to me as a fan that she would have to stand up to powerful people- which gandalf did to denethor by the way. he also ousted saruman out of theoden s body by breaking edoras s rules  and grima was in charge. but no one cares when gandalf does it. yeah we knew grima was bad  but it s similar behavior.i would argue we did see her change  which is why she tried to protect the kid from the southlands from ending up as hateful as she is in that conversation near the end.anyway  yeah agree to disagree  i just think there are other things that deserve more hate and i keep scratching my head about the level of backlash to this show.
@iforgot87872  the wokest thing about rings of power is probably the marketing. not even necessarily the casting. that s the bait. the black people they cast were exactly 1 black human  exactly 1 black elf  exactly 1 black dwarf  exactly 1 black hobbit  harfoot  whatever   none of them get any context or mention as to why they look different than anyone else. are they from a specific region  where people look like that  or are they melaninos  the opposite of albinos  even more rare   we aren t told. even tho they are seemingly important characters. no one seems to even notice. that s not necessarily wokeness  but it is race baiting at best and virtue signaling at worst  and i believe it is both. marketing puts them front and center  and pretends them playing those roles to be some ceiling shattering event. and when audiences point that out  ask why the black woman couldn t have been a haradrim  that do exist in tolkiens books  or make comments about black elves not appearing in the source materials at all  they point at them  call them racist and fascist  and use that to call everyone who doesn t like the series racist and fascist. there s more pretending to be political activism  persumably to win over the woke crowd. numenorian elf-hatred is a parody of right-wing talking points  just to make it even more obvious that it s wrong. the one white male on the posters  the one white male considered a main character  turns out to be sauron. and he goes on to try and conquer the world because galadriel rejects him  and he goes full incel. does all of that make rings of power woke  i ll let you decide. but there is certainly some attempts of catering to woke audiences. even tho it s doubtful the showrunners themselves are wokeists.
the darkness of melkor will be overthrown in time
@i4got872 ytp  yes  agree to disagree
@boozeaholic  maybe in the us but not in europe
gamergate did it first. expect hitpieces about  toxic transphobes in the hp-community  in the near future.
@iforgot87872  if one with the agenda  the agenda is not seen. agenda 101.
facts
a lot of fandoms fought back tho sadly star wars just gave up after like 5 minutes. but here is to us in the anime community keeping strong
@iforgot87872  ignore all of the arguments people make then twitter bot
@ryanwood6754  i was making arguments back did you miss them  i m a person  sorry my ideas bother you  i think there are annoying woke things  i just don t think rop is a great example.
we in hp fandom made those fruitcake basket cases - time to break them
@iforgot87872  even without woke points  it was a woke production  they strayed so heavily from lore that the fans couldn t console the show with tolkien s work.  that there is a huge woke thing  destroy another s work to make their own.  so yes it was woke  by nature of the destruction of a beloved work.
@samuraiedge2619  what happened to cowboy bebop
@falsebelievers  basically they changed many important aspects of some characters and the series was a complete disaster and was canceled almost immediately  after that a couple of actors defenders of certain ideology came out to criticize and blame the fans of the original anime for it s failure when they were the ones who were attacking the fandom during the promotion of the  live action .
im pretty sure i have to be discovered before i could get cancelled.    so i ll be streaming it
don t break their brain dude
its not really about people having different thoughts and opinions then them they just dont want people to be able to publicly share those thoughts and opinions with other people because they wish to clamp down on views they disagree with from spreading by trying to harm anyone that dares to speak out against their insanity
its funny huh when religion this time around is not the one doing it.
@ozarqus7310  this ideology is a non theistic religion.
@meesteranonymous8177  technically the first crusade was the muslims invading.also  the second definition of crusade is  a vigorous campaign for political  social  or religious change
@choryrth  not gonna lie  first paragraph got me scratching..by chance do you know who made the second definition and when
@meesteranonymous8177  the first crusade was the muslim islamic invasion of the christains  the next like 7 or so  were the christians retaliation. a lot of people just don t call it a crusade  even though it was one. it was a holy war religious war.  a war instigated for alleged religious ends  is another definition.and no  no clue. but it s well known  and the most often used way to use the word definition  but i googled it just in case  and it s the second definition.
@earlbedfordjr83  same shit.
agreed
@ozarqus7310  not necessarily. but for the purposes of separation of church and state all social based ideologies should be considered the same. which would include atheist non profits. the government shouldn t be siding with none of it.
that s my point  or even has done more disgusting things like exploitation of people  child work  pedo.... you get what i mean.like this is absurd.jk rowling doesn t even play part in the game. it s her universe but they made sure not to include her. and even made tran characters an option.like what more do they want...
@user-ci3vt9fi4w  to destroy the ip to destroy her
it makes me miss life before social media to some degree. back than you where allow to have your own opinion.
thank you brian  bless
thank you for speaking the truth and voicing your opinion in such a strong way! you just earned a subscriber. keep up the great work and looking forward to your future videos!
great to see you stayed true to yourself
how have i never discovered you before  instant follow and subscribe. keep up the great content and thank you for representing us sane folks. cheers!
imagine being a grown adult and thinking -  if i ask the bullies nicely  maybe they ll leave me alone
this is even more of a reason to play hogwarts legacy
i didn t realize how serious they were about this game until they started attacking streams for saying they would stream a game before its even out smh. btw great job on being consistent with your hydration
also i think you did right with the shots it should have been a personal choice between each individual persons or with families not something that should have been forced because i can understand both sides of it but i personally took 3 and still got it
ugh ok guys i am trans and ill be playing tf outta this. you re entitled to play what you wish this game is gonna be epic and i hope yall enjoy the hell out of it!
this mob thing is turning into something creepier like a gang of raging mobsters
i completely agree with you . i can t wait for the game to come out !
super refreshing to see another woman that games with similar ideals  first video of yours i m watching i m gonna sub for sure
the way a lot of the mob is  i haven t seen this kind of peer pressure since i was in school  these people are acting like what you d think were the cool crowd was and they ll try to pressure you to do  cool stuff  and label you as a loser if you don t but in reality it s hurting them more and yet they re looked at as the cool crowd
i ve been tempted to start a stream to stream hogwarts legacy. i mean it seems like a great boost to a streaming career
just discovered you on twitter. you are awesome! keep up the great work!
man im glad i grew up in a time when the worst thing i had to worry about was whether i could go to my friends house and play or not
i remember watching a video that was covering this exact topic before i had bought the game  before that i was just considering it because it 100  looked like a great game. well  halfway through the video  i paused it  went to steam  and bought the digital deluxe edition...
seriously  that s sad.
you ve got it backwards  they re the ones bullying anyone who doesn t bend over for them and they don t want to be left alone  they beg for attention.
@84c4  pretty sure that s a huge  whooooosh for you my friend...either that  or it s a huge  whooooosh for me. one of us is def whooshing right now
@renzo_kookin4208  i m pretty sure you got it renzo.
@morganpike7612  hahaha i thought so...thanks for the clarity  his confusion was making me confused
@renzo_kookin4208  pretty sure this one s on me  i didn t realize he was talking about the streamer  i done goofed this one. lolthe woke weirdos narrative is always  you re oppressing me  please stop  or i ll destroy you    so my mind went straight for them.
it s what happens when you come from a soft world  you become a snowflake who gets triggered over everything no matter how small it is.
@lockonstratos7787  good times create weak men.
i don t watch much streaming  but i will watch hogwarts legacy streams when it come out  just to say screw these people.
i wasn t really hipped about hogwarts legacy and wasn t about to play it but now i really want to play it.
to be fair  if you just live by  always do the absolutely totally opposite of what brianna wu tells you to do  you ll be off to a good start in every facet of life
totally agree with all you ve said.... play the games and stream the content you want to do  me personally i ve not been a fan of the harry potter franchise from day one  i mean i enjoyed the movies from 3 onward but found 1 and 2 irritating  2 less so but still... however i ve had people come to me with  why watching show movie or playing that game   crap and my response has always been  because i want to.... dont like.... dont play or watch it...  simples the problem with the woke crowd is everything has had to appease them... they ruined a couple of the franchises i grew up with  and because of that i wont watch any of the newer stuff... but the older stuff created before  sure... that s on my list of most enjoyed as it will always be  and the reason why... cos i refuse to allow the woke tribe out there ruin the enjoyment i have had with what i like or love.... and people should realise they have a choice... they can pander to these irritable ingrates who have the capacity of a glorified muppet which crossbred with a spoiled and ungrateful person  who always had their own way... which they ll never satisfy.... or they can satisfy themselves  and play and watch what they want and form their own opinions based on what they prefer... after all the reason we are called individuals and are set apart from sheep following people  is because we have the ability to choose our own paths and we dont need anyone else to determine what we like or dislike for us
@joebeezy9471  weak men create hard times
@darkangeleu  imagine being a minority and thinking you re more important than the majority
only thing thats ever worked for bullies is breaking their nose.
this isn t about being trans  straight   ect.  my guess is a lot of people causing this drama arnt even truely trans.  they are just unhappy people who want to bring everyone down with them.
you can t play this game or else you re a loser  um yeah  that sounds like how school bully s were being depicted as back when i was in school
they re more like pod people from the invasion of the body snatchers.
when haven t they
@thegreywanderer8427  such a good movie  yo.
they would have to leave the house to be a true threat and we know that s not happening.
a cult of sociopaths.
@christophersmirnoff5222  im going with this one  even though they indeed also pull of mobster concepts constantly.
it s only creepy if you are a beta boy
i grew up dirt poor. my friends and i found sticks shaped like guns to play with. we d spend all day running around the neighborhood and building forts wherever we could with whatever we could find. i can t imagine a better childhood.wait a minute. since we were poor  am i owed something
@morganpike7612  hah  yeah reality owes you a check.
@morganpike7612  although young  17 soon to be 18  i also grew up dirt poor in a poor country. simpler days where youd go up to someones window and scream their names to see if their mother let them play outside or not... but i do not wish those days on anybody now. may have been fun but id rather have a child that grows up on technology and doesnt have to wonder what he will have to eat at the end of the month because theres nothing in the fridge...
@idfkidfc5451  that s what we all want for our children. not necessarily the technology part but we all want to spare our kids from the pain of an empty belly. unfortunately  those who grow up never wanting for anything end up feeling entitled. i won t pretend to know the answer to this dilemma. i ve been on both sides. went hungry sometimes as a kid and  raised kids who never did. luckily mine didn t go crazy but i see it things like wasting food on their plate. something i could never do. even though i know i have enough now  that behavior and mindset is now a part of me.
the only thing missing are pitchforks.
@alphaqhard  they are scared to lose their precious video games. sad.
@jimmymac2292  you have the most beta ccomment so far...
@jimmymac2292  says the actual beta soyboy.
they ve always been
@sannypowa  that s exactly what they are my friend! well said!
@galadrius the mighty  don t need pitchforks. they prefer molotov cocktails. like civilized   mostly peaceful  individuals.
@the hero class  yeah  cry more about hogwarts.
@sannypowa  wow  stellar reply. cluching your pearls about harry potter
@sannypowa  stop arguing with the hate bots.
@jimmymac2292  no  i just hate cancel culture and i want to put an end to it.
@batman0  lol
@thegreywanderer8427  they re like the aliens in the faculty
@sawdust8691   peaceful.  suuuuure.
@galadrius the mighty            mostly  peaceful.     also a pretty inaccurate description huh  they seem to always be out for blood on some stupid non-issue or another.
@thegreywanderer8427  at this point i think they are some.
its becoming the salem with trials  people are attacking others and jumping on the bandwagon  so they dont get accused of the same things. there is a destructive feedback loop happening and it isnt going to stop until everything falls apart.
@paultate5213  says a person who fell for the age-old  unnamed boogeyman named  they
@paultate5213  they re usually too fat to fit out of their front doors   lol!
@sannypowa  defending the socialists  doesn t get more soy than that.
turning  always had been.
speaking of mobsters where s good old al capon when yo need him
they re worse than death eaters.
you just woken up to that  you re about a decade behind.
@synthlizard8  just pointing out the lesser of two evils.
must be something in the water
@yagamifire7861  i am an atheist but it saddens me to see people abandoning churches to end up in a cult. that sucks.
at least mobsters rock up make thier point and bugger off
their groomers man
@paultate5213    ever hear of anthrax
@the unbeheld  harry potter is a child s book  adults concerned about children s books and super heroes in the context of their own fandom is regressive behavior.
everyone needs to stream this game!
like a cult you could say
even if their crybullying mattered  you can t cancel us all.
yesss! true and real. it does much more harm to yourself when you conform to something that you know is not true or good than the backlash that you will get for not conforming to insanity. denying reason will send you down a path where you will only be a shadow of your former self.
i think they just don t want to separate the product from the creator. since y know  i doubt j.k. had really any final say on plot points and was probably only contacted in a sense of   does this makes sense in universe    but that s just what i think.
i can t wait to play as a wizard and have a pet owl!
i wasn t even going to get this game until it went on sale  i have been let down by a lot of aaa games as of late. this video just made me want to buy it on day one.
they make me want to get hogwarts legacy and start streaming.
this will never end and will only get worse if they re allowed to constantly get away with their insanity
streamers playing hogwarts legacy    challenge accepted!
appreciate you speaking out about the mandates.
there is power in numbers....all the streamers should do a takeover....pick a time and everyone with a copy of the game streams play at the same time.....are the streaming services really going to cut their own throat and strike that large of a number of creators
i m very tempted to start keeping a tally of how many individual weirdos want people to boycott the game and then just buy that many copies and give them away for free
man i bought this game just to show them they can t control me. not a big harry potter fan  but i will say the game looks alot of fun. i m going to fail this test with flying colors  and i m ok with that. first video i have ever seen of yours  and now i m a subscriber
honestly  i don t care about these people s fragile feelings  i just want them to tear up in rage while i play hogwarts legacy!
this coverage made me a fan. good shit. stand bold against these controlling weirdos
i hardly ever pre order games but now i feel like i have to buy this game.
the people trying to boycott and cancel hogwarts legacy are actually promoting it. they are drawing so much attention to it  it s actually getting more people to buy it. it always backfires on them  it s so hilarious.
this is making me want to preorder the game for the first time ever
it backfired hilariously though. ppl that dont even like hp are preordering just bc these ppl are saying not to lmao
@btnhstillfire  right thanks to them hl is hugely successful
the only reason it was so effective before  this crybullying thing  was due to twitter protecting their fee fees
@btnhstillfire  me
crybullying is a funny term.
exactly right lol  let s say they actually bullied all the big streamers  all it would take is a nobody to stream the game and people would flock to it and that person would become popular simply because they were willing to stream it as everyone else bend their knee to the woke mob.
its funny cause they help game sell better then it would have
never give in to the woke mob. and i believe that the way this game is going. i believe that hogwarts legacy will be up for game of the year and maybe win it as well.
never apologize to these people. they need psychiatric help.
you just earned a sub girl! common sense isn t common!
they have freedom of speech just like we do.
@user-ly4xs8rh9q  and we should use our freedom to call them out for their authoritarian bs.
@captainalex157  yes we can. but we also have to show some respect. just because we strongly dissagree does not mean we get to shit on them! that is my whole problem  people are beeing so incredibly hateful  agressive and showing pure evil. we have to respect others opinions like we want them to respect ours
@user-ly4xs8rh9q  im all for civilized discussion. but i wouldnt say we need to respect all opinions  tolerate them more like it. for example i wont respect the opinions of a nazi when it comes to jews.
i heard buying this game end lives  how is that even possible sorry i m not from america.
@user-ly4xs8rh9q  yea except they manage to only speak evil
@allgameplays  it doesnt everything bad that your hearing about this game is honestly  woke  bs dont fall into it
@user-ly4xs8rh9q   they drew first blood  not me
@user-ly4xs8rh9q  freedom of speech and freedom to control people are 2 different things
@richard  i m all up for freedom of speech  however we still have the freedom to disagree. also it depends how absurd the statement is. e.g if someone is telling me i m killing trans people by buying a video game in my own home.. that s literally nonsensical and moronic. i have nothing against trans people at all and trying to use emotional manipulation to stop me playing a game about wizards in school does not deserve my respect. am i open to listening to opinions  absolutely. doesn t mean i have to respect absolute drivel.
if you really want to tear them up  create a trans character and unalive 41  of the way through. bonus points if you advertise as an ally and stream it up to that point.
i am buying the game and i rarely ever play games anymore  i am doing it just because the little totalitarians do not want me to buy it  in fact i will buy it for gifts.
same here let the haters cope   seethe
@frishter  haha that ll be awesome
@drawingmagicboy  gonna be honest  i was actually seriously considering it because i figured that if you did it smartly  you might be able to go viral and get a quick ticket to success if you managed to get banned from one platform purely from the outrage and have a counter following afterwards.
what a time to be alive  you play a game and you get ridiculed for playing said game.
i am not a streamer  but if i was  i would definitly stream hogwarts legacy. and i m buying the game on 1st day it releases!
i ll be getting hogwarts legacy  was gonna wait a while for it to go on sale  but because of the backlash i m gonna preorder it this coming week to upset the jk rowling haters
i hope this game hits the top of the sales charts when it s released.  the meltdowns would be glorious to witness.
tbh i ve been thinking of starting a streaming career based on this stuff  starting with hogwarts legacy
the problem is likely to be that twitxh mods will get involved and blacklist the game once it gets close to release. the bigger partner streamers have likely been warned by twitch staff that it is coming. twitch itself may dodge a lawsuit  by saying it s a rogue employee  but i expect to see that twitch will put the game on their blacklist in february once the news dies.
those bullies will never leave you alone if you give them an inch!before you know it everything  will need to be approved by them  freedom of choice will begone forever!
feel like i should start streaming just to stream this game.
i m buying hogwarts twice just to give one away to a friend and promote it that way go hogwarts legacy stand up for your rights
calling it now hogwarts is gonna be the most streamed game of february.
i hope people play and stream it. i m on ps4 so have to wait until april to nab it. i m curious to see the game play and which houses are best etc
if twitch comes out and cancels streamers for playing this game  that will not only be not surprising but also a huge step backwards for them as a platform. here s hoping youtube won t. i d say  let s hope twitch doesn t  but we all know they probably will.
imagine a streamer not playing what is probably going to be the biggest game in a long while.
this video made me sub. im glad to see people not giving a shit. i lost family over me buying this game for me and one of my partners. im part of the community with the alphabet mafia. so as someone thats part of the community so many people who dont care how this looks on us. i appreciate you and your content
you can preorder too!
imagine  if your not on twitter these people s have absolutely 0 effect on you  it s brilliant. i ll be playing the game cant wait.
the problem these days is  everyone is fearless behind a keyboard  but once those persons face other people personally the bravery disapears instantly!!! streamers won t get cancelled  specially the big ones!!! they aren t doing anything wrong!!!
you d think people would be a little more tolerant of others in this day and age. i guess stupidity and ignorance will never go out of style.  -carth onasi  star wars  knights of the old republic
after years of waiting for big budget  triple a harry potter game to be made  it gets released into a storm of controvery. already have it pre-ordered but it s still disappointing that that s the world we live in
i say the hell with them all. all that smack they talk online guarantee you they wouldn t say that in person to anybody because they know the repercussions and consequences of their actions or even attempting to do something about that somebody in person will lead to their demise.
it definitely will.  looks like a really fun play.
these lunatics are going to make it a best seller of all time. it s hilarious
why   it s a shit game full of  diversity  and  trans inclusive character creation .
@fredrick2003  they give you the option to personalize your character any way you want at least.....it s something good i guess...
@fredrick2003  the  diversity  is the players choice though it seems like. you create your character however the hell you want  it s not forced on you to be a certain character
@kitingaful  i just don t understand why they re punishing so many people that worked on this game just because at least 1 person  jk r.  said something.what about everyone else that poured their hearts into this game  there s probably someone involved in the creation of the game that is lgbtq  and the woke group is indirectly affecting them. blows my mind.
it s already on top on all platforms
it s already  1 here and i think  2 in the uk.  pre-orders...
it might because they themselves are giving it the best publicity. people who didn t care about it are now gonna buy it all hp fans are gonna buy it and a lot of fans who don t even play videogames are buying consoles for this game. educated people who respect others views and do not shove them down another individual s throat will buy it. i mean  just cause you stated something publicly doesn t mean people have to agree. i have many lgbtq  family and i have talked to them about it and they couldn t care less. we even laughed about those making it a big deal  they are literally trying to deprive devs and studios from getting paid.
@fredrick2003  have a cry about it
i want to play it. looks like a fun game. wished there was online wizard tournament. though it s alright the way it is still. can t wait to play it.
why stop at february  i m calling it stream of the year!!!!
it s already on top of the steam charts for sales just on the pre orders.
i m of 2 minds. i hate it because its harry potter and i also hate rowling and her wokeness which caused this shit. but i hate the people who are trying to censor it.i just say let them eat their own
@fredrick2003  you don t have to interact with any of those people. you play your game with your character that you create. the other folks are playing their game with their character that they create and you never even meet them. there are no trans npcs that i ve heard about. it s all just character creation for the player to immerse themselves.
i hope it becomes game of the year
@fredrick2003  it goes to show that nothing is enough.  bending the knee to them is a mistake.
i think the game looks good. i do not see the issue with it.
if i could afford to buy the game on release then i would make a point to stream just as a middle finger.
thank you so much for supporting jk rowling and women s rights! i had you follow you!
to hell with those people. if you want to play that game  play it. if you give into their demands  you will be giving into those people for the rest of your life. if you want to stream this game  just do it. youtube should step up and stop the canceling of streamers.
my next tweet would have been   you guys are right. i will no longer be streaming hogwarts legacy and donating the money. i have decided to keep the money.
i am not that interested on the game itself  but i am tempted to buy it just to stand up to these people..  -   i guess here we will see the streamers that stand up to social pressure and those that don t.
best part of the entire thing is that their so called  boycott  has helped sell more copys of the game than anything the streamers could do at this point   d
am definitely gonna pre order the deluxe  version now.
so going to stream the game and hope that big names like asmongold do too
when you ve killed all the bad guys  and it s all perfect and just and fair  when you have finally got it exactly the way you want it  what are you going to do with the people like you  the troublemakers. how are you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one     the doctor speech
your stance on this issue just got you another sub from me and a like on this video
i just want to play the game  cast spells and explore the game.. no bs gonna stop me from doing that
the troublemakers  likely response   reeeeeeee!
definitely one of my all time favourite speeches from doctor who
i used to loove doctor. they f ed it up too
by far capaldi s best scene. love that speech.
don t worry  half of the people will follow me  and half of the people will follow you.    joseph stalin s last words to vladimir lenin
my favorite scene of any episode. the power in that script was phenomenal.
@mkultra3034  just had to create an existential crisis in people didnt you
@plat217  rtd   tennant are back so i think it will be good again
yes  make the supply smaller  more views for the people streaming the game. people pretend that not buying this game will somehow hurt jk as if she is not set for life.
i am going to buy and play this game..period if it offends people...good. don t care. i ll use their tears to keep my screen clean while i m playing it. i like the fact you aren t afraid to say how you feel. you earned my subscription.
nerd culture  i hate to use that term  it sounds so stupid  has been a place for us to hang out. we found friends online because we did not fit in as well in the meat space. sadly  bullies have been allowed to punch  push  threaten and make life hell for us while holding up the cause of the moment and trying to look virtuous. they are no different from the mean kids we all had in school. they stay in gangs to not have to fight on their own and they attack when there are a lot of them. at the same time  those people who do not fit in  seek to join them to be a  cool kid . that is sjw culture. a bunch of misfits using their frailties like armor while they abuse the crap out of people who don t agree. it is to the point they make up frailties so they have that armor which is really  really sick.  until everyone punches back and ignores the fake outrage we will be like this. everyone needs push back when they go too far. we don t excuse a drunk for driving because they are alcoholic  we shouldn t excuse toxicity and bullying because someone is trans or something. screw them. if they can t get along in life without bullying  they can die alone.
cool  now i want to play it more. wasn t a big fan of hp but i am a fan of fantasy and magic. lets get it.
i wonder in what part of the terms of service that these companies can justify cancelling a streamer for playing this game.
hey dude want to do harry potter marathon   friend   how dare you... we are no longer friends...  me   wtf
which episode is that one from
@creativewm_personal  the zygon inversion
fantastic speech from an amazimg actor
@creativewm_personal  season 9 episode 8
@gregcourtney6310  never saw that one
@mkultra3034  in other words they all follow him
@gregcourtney6310  nope  he is being brought back to be belittled  and shamed. they need to ruin the one doctor who is most people s favourite  now.  to trample western men into the dirt  just a little more...
that s why the emperor killed all the thunder warriors after the last battles.
i m not a streamer but i want to be one yet i am not fully equipped to do any streaming. but if i was able to  i would stream hogwarts legacy  not only for my enjoyment but for everyone else s as well.
i never planned on buying the game  but after this. i pre-ordered the deluxe edition.
oh harry  don t you see   hermione breathed.  if she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview  it was banning it! - harry potter and the order of the phoenix
