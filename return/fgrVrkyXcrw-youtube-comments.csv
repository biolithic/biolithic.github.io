hey melonie been following your channel for a long time love this new channel as well. really loving the unapologetic sharing of your faith. on the note of the law and the new covenant I highly recommend joseph prince he blew my mind saying similar things as you mentioned. also I totally agree the closer we get to God the less we want to sin even though we all fall short. keep up the great work!

I hop back on twitter on the 28th of october after about a decade and your right there as a recommended follow  and I see that little cross and Im like huh  she s a Christian.  so I followed you there  hopped back on youtube and subscribed and started watching your videos.  its really nice to find a content creator who shares my faith as well as whatever other interests.

I love how you add Bible verses and faith-based educational moments into your videos!

Ive never considered myself particularly religious I dont even know if I believe in God or not but I do find the Bible quotes at the end of your videos interesting and it gives me something to think about during my day

even though Im not religious. I appreciate the Bible talk because I can see it gives you so much strength plus so many others in this world.

hey  mel! Im far away from the tomb raider as you can get  but the topic is interesting. question  which version of the Bible is best for a beginner  Im an atheist  but recently became intrigued with religion. cheers from russia!

this is great commentary!  not just on lara croft  but on the Bible too!  Jesus shed his blood for everyone!  so  if we follow him  we should show love and respect...to everyone!   -

love the Bible verses in the videos and your not afraid to give your opinions on stuff

that  go boom indeed  comment u read made me think of that michelangelo  cowabunga  meme..and I could so see u taking a fitting pic of urself and captioning it as  go boom it is  ......annd on a more personal note  I rly appreciate ur Bible verses bcoz despite being atheist I want to believe and hearing those and ur commentary on them helps
as austin powers would say   thats a man  baby!

@melonie mac go boomÂ  thank you! I bought the audio version of king james s Bible. will it be ok as a starting point

there is a good passage in the Bible where Jesus came to them after his resurrection and they asked what will we do when you leave us. Jesus says follow my father s commandments and I have one of my own. love each other as I love you.

I see you melonie. just casually flexing those guns at the start of the video. loving the inclusion of the Bible at the end of each video. it is refreshing.  judge not  that ye be not judged. for with what judgement ye judge  ye shall also be judged.

I love your Bible talk and appreciate you! Im binge watching the  melonie goes boom  videos right now. its a regular sunday and it feels like Imissed these videos.

right  good  and just  keep on sharing Jesus!  keep being a voice for the gaming community.

Im glad for your scripture moments. I have been working on getting back into the word more this year. I have been successful or at least better  but your little tidbits have really helped with that  in a since of community. to share my side for a 2way street  my current plan on daily biblical readings is a 21 day plan of Jesus  parables. today the parable of the pharisee and the tax collector.
