this is always why I wait a few days if a story breaks in entertainment  politics and or pop culture.
I will never understand why people immediately side with the supposed victim  especially one clearly engaging in emotional manipulation. victimhood is a currency in 2022.
someone pointed this out but hellena taylor is basically gonna be blacklisted from voicing any character in a japanese heck maybe even western developed games due to how she handled this situation cuz she intentionally lied and left out crucial information to get support from others.
bloomberg  she asked for six-figures.taylor  I did not ask for  250 000! they re lying!thats a very specific number you have here  hellena...
when this first popped off  one of the first things I did was look up helena on imdb.jennifer hale  the voice actress hired for bayonetta 3  has some 400  credits over on imdb.  she is praised by fans and peers alike.helena hasn t done anything for the last 8 years.  fans loved her bayonetta but you have to wonder why she wasn t in anything else.  I would guess the air of entitlement she showed has something to do with it.  she burned her career to the ground here.  who would want to work with her moving forward  who would trust her to not air any grievance she might have publicly  shameful.
the nsane thing here is the studio did the right thing. considering that the last game was 8-10 years ago. they contacted her. they had her read on the part to make sure her voice was still good. and they made her what by all research seems to be a very reasonable offer.  4000 session which is quite a bit higher than her sag aftra contracted  900 session rate. she demanded 6 figures and residuals  something that voice actors do not get from video games. the two parties failed to reach agreement. the studio offered her a flat  4k to do a smaller one session cameo  and recast the main part with jenifer hale. this is perfectly normal  perfectly above board business. she s mad because she did not get a part of the earnings from the prior games. the ones thatshe apparently contributed about 15 hours work for each. as opposed to the publishers who shouldered the risk and put up the money to get the games made  or the developers who spent tens of thousands of hours  using their hard earned skills and education  to create. 15 fucking hours work per game! but  she s an actor!!!
what is also telling is that with the new context  her videos take on a more deceptive meaning. the things she says sound sincere  but when you learn the details and re-watch them they hide the sinister intentions. for example  she says... their final offer was  4000 for the entire game.  we now know thatshe was offered  15 000 and she rejected it. the 4k was a gesture of respect for 1-hour cameo as love note to fans because she wouldn t accept the other deal. she will never be hired as a voice actress again. she s damaged goods.
Im glad to see an update on this story. it felt really fishy how little info she gave and how hard she went on the game. she s not the only person who worked on bayonetta 3 and to throw the entire team under the bus because she didn t get paid what she wanted seemed rather underhanded and entitled.
helena taylor by her own admission now was offered 15000 over 3 6-8 hour sessions. thats 650 per hour before tax. any common worker would be head over heels with that. before this I bet hardly any gamer could tell you her name. if she thought it was too low she should have said no thanks and go about her life. I agree with you that her career is dead now. especially because she lied. great video.
incredible actress. her performance as bayonetta was fantastic  so sad to see her career end this way.
glad you held off on this story. so many times it pays to wait for more info. its sad thatshe s done this because I sure wouldn t hire someone that did what she has. have a great day melonie!
its gunna be hilarious when we see her crying about not being able to get work cause she trashed a potential client because they didn t want to pay her what she thinks they should lmao
asking to boycott the game was weird because that would just be a slap in the face of everyone else who made the game and had nothing to do with her wages. imagine everyone seeing all their hard work in flames
sad to see because it is an iconic character and voice  and helena is obviously going through some tough times  this will hurt her career now. however as a longtime fanboy of jennifer hale I have no doubt she ll do the character justice.
hey melonie. Im a 16 year old boy from south africa your videos help me so much. they heal me when I feel sad and they help. you ve also restored my faith in God after a hard year. I became very suicidal and angry at the world because Im disabled but your videos helped me more than anything.
what made me question this story was when it was mentioned jennifer hale was hired for the job. I was pretty sure she would be worth than a flat 4k rate  and probably would not work for a fee that low.
nintendo doesnt even need to promote the game at this point hellena taylor is pretty much promoting the game for them because of the amount of attention it got due to her calling for a boycott. if its about wanting more money she could ve asked for more money. its not hard to do.
this is funny cause she is doubling down on the lie and it is just making her look so much worse. good Lord way to ruin your reputation because you could not negotiate well.hope everyone has a fantastic day and Im surprised Im so early.
she asked for six figures  - jason   I did not ask for 250k  - hellana     that was a weirdly specific number no one else ever used ms taylor. hmmmmmmmmmmm
the problem is you dont get to decide your own value as a voice actor. the market  ie what video game companies are willing to pay for you to voice act  is what determines your value as a voice actor. the fact thatshe is trying to destroy the success of the game because she didn t get what she wanted says a lot about her as a person.
as a man of action  as soon as anything displeasing comes to my eyes and ears  I rheeeeeeeeeeeeee
this is the way
@creatorsfreedom!!!  su cuygar
why...  its not like people would lie to claim victimhood for clout  money  or revenge...................................
good 2 weeks for me.
wise thinking.
yep  right there with you bud. I never make a judgement until I get both sides of a story. no matter how bad it looks  no matter how much flak I get. case in point  I am yet to make a judgement on the whole  amouranth s abusive husband  situation because there is only her side out there. does it look like he s an abusive asshole  yes. is it possible through careful curation and entrapment thatshe is making it look like he s a total monster when really he s not  also yes.
I learned with the covington kids and byu racial slur story  wait a bit before making a judgment.
bias and projection. they would want people to side with them in any situation  but are also antiwork  have no understanding of supply demand or living wage  and just feel entitled to receive whatever they think they re worth. they dont realize thatsimply because you want something doesnt mean youre worth it  or that any given entity needs to pay it.
2022  its been like this and seems to be getting worse to where I hope people can wake up and stop it
there s a cycle where people regret past victims that didn t get attention and then demand unquestioning support for any claims and skeptics are pressured. eventually the fake victims get so obvious more people push back against knee-jerk accusations and the a vocal handful of people become very outspoken about never believing alleged victims and then there are genuine victims feel silenced. listen and believe  was back in the 1990s  there was a bit more skepticism back in the 2000s  and then we got  believe all women  in the 2010s. it is a brutal cycle of people finding out the edges of what social pressure can be used and what skepticism people can express without hostile reactions.the way to end the cycle is to simply wait for evidence  be skeptical  and avoid making a judgement until evidence is in. sadly  some people are prone to knee-jerk reactions so the result is like how vibration in engines causes them to break down.
I have to admit that I was one of them  although I usually wait for evidence  knowing what happens with voice actors and this actress in particular having some recognition  I did not think thatshe will need deception to improve her position  with all this the idiot ruined her career .
I want to like this multiple times ffs
because she s a women  if she was a man it would be a different situation  just look at what happen with jonny depp.
to be honest  with how developers are treated in certain game companies  its easier to believe someone when they play the victim card
especially gamers and our fellowship. youd think after all the scams and political targeting we have seen especially after me too that we would question things before siding with someone. yet I saw so many channels that do political videos instantly supporting her without question then having to peddle it back later and say  weeellll I didnt totally believe her . like cmon you fell for it hook line and sinker just admit it and learn from your mistake. personally I didnt get involved in this mess. I sussed something about it after all the stuff like projared and other me too type crap where everyone sides with the  victim  only for the  victim  to be the aggressor.
idk why anyone has energy for outrage anymore. we ve all been had so many times  everyone single person alive that has spent time on the internet should be suspicious about any drama from any politicians and celebrity f-list up to and including a-list.
I feel ya  I actually jumped on the hate of those kids in dc with the maga hats and the native american. after researching very much realized a narrative was produced and I fell for it. I now follow your mantra.
yeah  especially when something like that pops up. itseemed intentionally inflammatory and way too convenient.Ive just been sitting back and observing.
or just wait till steven crowder uploads far as politics go. my go to guy. him and lauren chen. pop culture I look to people like melonie mac goes boom or josiah rises
same here. before the vic mignogna situation I would always jump to conclusions and go to one side but ever since then I have always waited for the whole story and then take a sidejust like with the quantum tv situation
just use common sense and critical thinking skills. I knew that chick was lying before even finishing all 3 videos.
to be perfectly fair  it was somewhat believable at first because voice actors are always terminally underpaid. but this is her using thatsame conversation to fuck up the previously understood conversation about underpaid talent.
its called the  noisy minority effect . I just made that up but you get the gist of what Im saying.
@viktor vondoom  did you write this while you had a migraine sweety
as someone that knows people that are professional actors  her type of occupation is not really a great way of making a living and really doesnt pay much unless you are a top talent. you would be surprised at how many who do this professionally are struggling just to put a roof over their head.
@fallen soul  wow! love the razor sharp wit there. I neither support nor condemn the va. all I am saying is there are a lot of people mistreated in the gaming industry  hence it is easier to believe someone when they play the victim card.
@shinyajax unless youre top talent  actors do not get paid much. I can speak from experience because I know people who do stage acting professionally. these people literally have to take on second and third jobs just to keep their acting career and cover the basics i.e food and shelter.
not gonna lie  I wasn t buying the game in the first place  I played the first one  never bothered to complete it  its not for me. but  I did  admittedly  enjoy having an extra reason not to buy the game. now  Im happy I didn t buy the second game and give her money. its win win for me. lol. but seriously  if they had done what she claimed  they re messed up  but it turns out  she s apparently messed up. cant wait for her to respond and to find out that they re both messed up.
because being a victim is in style
people are emotional. and emotions can be easily manipulated.
@gloria thomas  well she not meant to be living off one singular pay role... actors get paid to the work they get... just like with every other freelancing job out there. that the risk you undertake.
I admitted that I was on her side at first because by publicly spoke out like thatshe has commited career suicide
demonizing is the anti-currency  too  said a russian guy lol
blm has entered the chat
@gloria thomas    unless youre top talent  actors do not get paid much. uh...yeah. I know this. thats what my comment was saying  why are youreplying like I said otherwise
that and people just want to be mad at something and they re looking for a vantage point they can attack someone and be righteous about it  seeing people where so fast at attacking the va that got the role since she turned it down  they dont care what the talk is about  if its true  they just want a reason to get mad and  win   doesnt matter if there is any truth or justice to it.
@blastoise buddy  props to dior for sauvage though.
@saifis  crusade logic yup
she s a woman. everyone takes a woman s side  instinctively.  its human biology.
@viktor vondoom  thats why its an easy scam
@shinyajax  how are they underpaid  a contract is signed by both parties  their time is only worth what somebody else is willing to pay. let s not forget the job is  show up in pajamas  hang out in a climate controlled studio  speak  go home
when victimhood is the currency  expect counterfeiters.
I never really  sided  with her  cause they didint owe her the role  they are free to recast the character. but regardles the act of lowballing someone so they are forced to get out of a project is objectively shady practice  no matter their motivation and preety common  therefore not super unlikely to happen. my biggest doubt was what exactly made them not want to work with her all of the sudden. honestly this only hurts discourse massively and indirectly ends up hurting the very legitimate conversation of voice actors being massively underpaid sometimes  and thats is very unfortunate because now conversation just shifts into the lies and is not about the existing issue. I guess it could also be argued that what they offered her was fair or not considering how massive the ip is but then again I dont know exactly what good deals are in in voice acting world so I still wont judge her.
Im pretty sure you be siding with her if you were a professional actor as actor dont really make much money.
its all titles  the more popular   the more they d support without question. people are just people in the end of the day...
@shinobi-no-bueno    you have literally no understanding of how voice acting works  do you
@ricky uzumaki  doesnt need to  she only voiced 1 character 3 times and last time she voiced her was back in 2014. people jump fast to  everyone should be paid higher  when taylor isn t even worth that yet.she s not worth the effort of considering valuing her  hard work   when she hasn t worked hard in the va industry yet.if she had a quarter of jennifer hale s portfolio number than its totally fair for her to ask for more.
its called  innocent until proven guilty  in case you ve been living under a rock for the past few centuries
you know how to know if a woman is lying  if she s speaking she s lying
because people have been ignoring survivors of things like sexual assault and other abuses. as a result people try their damndest to overcompensate by siding with whoever speaks out about anything  missing social cues that hint at deceit.
I keep track of voice acting and I know that anime vas dont get paid a lot  but videogame and cartoon vas get paid more  which is why some anime vas moved over to video games and never came back to anime.  this is why I thought her saying she was only offered  4 000 was fishy.
because actors get mistreated all the time in the industry to the point that eveb other voice actors thought  yeah  this checks out  siding with victims is good  worst case scenario they get exposed like in this case
ikr
fact
@dudemaister18  no dude  the worst case scenario of siding with the victim is that those they accuse have their life destroyed before the truth comes out  which is quite common.
remember  we must believe all women. no matter what.  according to them anyway.
her career was already dead so
and she called to boycott a game she worked on. thats a big no no.
@raskolnikov  true if I remember right she s only voice bayo and hasnt done any other voice work which idk why she d make that decision she should ve tried other roles
@kingkilla 777  she s got other work.
lying and attempting to harm and cancel a company just because she didn t like the negotiation that wasn t even remotely illegal or inappropriate in any way  it really looks bad  she definitely destroyed her va career.
@jundageki  what she did was defamation. its against the law.
@raskolnikov  she boycotted the game because she realized rejecting 15k for more money was a bad move. since she broke nda  it backfired.
not to mention demanding that customers boycott the product because she didn t like the payment that was offered.I hope helena knows how to flip burgers. because no one will ever want to hire her as an actress again
no developer is going to work with an actor that willingly broke their nda. if she actually had a career to speak of  it would be over.
@raskolnikov  her career was on life support  she just pulled the plugI even doubt she ll get a job in theatre as well.
innit great
I forgot that the article only said  six-figures  lmao
methinks she s overshooting.
@psypher wolf  she also wanted residuals so yes  way overshooting.
I honestly thought she was asking for about 100 to 150k. which in itself is alot. but the 250k plus residuals seems to make sense when she calls it a 450 million dollar franchise. she attributes the game success to her voice and her voice iconic to the role so she wanted her cut. she thought she was indispensable and got mad when she learned she wasn t. .
@kelvin w.  well not really since she made 10s of millions for the games...
@kelvin w.  yep I cant really think of a game that I wouldn t have played because of them changing the voiceactor. I was a little bummed with mgsv not having david hayter voicing snake but I still played the game and then the twist made me think it actually worked better with the story or that it was like a hint from kojima. rip mgs you deserved so much better than konamI s souless cash grabbing gave you  and to this day no game has ever had multiplayer thatstole my heart like mgs4 online. running around with liquid making finger guns and yelling  bang  gave me the ability to piss off all my friends before grabbing em slapping a sleeping gas mine on them  choking em out and  teabagging beform running off cackling over the vc like a mad man. I dont think another game will ever make a more fun multiplayer I remember the day they pulled the plug me and all my buddies logged in one last time to squeeze out just a few more games.
a lochness monster asked for fo-fiddy.
yup  she is probably done.  nobody wants to offer somebody work if they might try to cancel you if they dont like the offer.  I was really surprised she even did that in the first place.
woke playstation might take her
@david conway jr.  but not much and nothing that was as major of a role.
she probably already has been  she hasn t had a voice role since 2014.
@lemon party  when I said  it wasn t illegal  Imeant the negotiation.
if we could only make all women accountable for her actions. that would be paradise
@tomasz szupryczynski  it would be a first.
I dont know about the twisted west  but in japan she s dead already.
she was blacklisted the second she complained
@don fairfield  long before.  2014.
@don fairfield  what is funny she was only voice in a game. looking at her reality picture was a joke like sex-phone lines in old days  sometimes even that was a dude. who had more sexy female voice than women. and here comes best part. she silenced herself without anyone help. she can cry now whole day and nobody will listen. just like us men feel whole life
@david conway jr.  which is clearly not working  remember thatshe told a sob story  of not being able to run her car   begging  for living wage  so what other work
@tomasz szupryczynski  er  u r the  incel  monster I didn t actually believe existed  eh
@don fairfield  and what  thatshould offend me  make me angry  insult you back. no need you showed already your level. I just laugh
she killed her career by not taking the deal like other voice actors that want to build a strong portfolio lol. she hasn t had any work since 2014  bayonetta 2 on the wii-u  and thought she was worth 10x s more than her actual market value .
its a shame too  Im playing bayonneta 1 on ps3 latelly  and she had talentthe rare times where bayonneta is a bit afraid or concerned for cereza luka it feels human  and she has a good voice for combat situations too
@elikyia el  Ive heard some of hale s take on bayonetta and its just not the same.  I dont have a switch so Im not getting 3 anyway  but if I were  I d miss her voice.thatsaid  she threw it all away  and deserves to be exactly where she s at.  they shouldn t have even offered the cameo.  what she did here was disgusting.
@thekingofruckus  amen bro
I wonder if she s in financial trouble and thats why she ranted about how she needed more money
she also seems to  believe thatshe s too good for mere video game voice acting and is resentful that bayonetta is what she s known for. no wonder she struggled to get other jobs in the va industry!
jennifer hale is an s-tier voice actress. always love when I hear her voice in a game.
@mr. s  she voiced black cat in the first playstation spider-man game way back in 2000.  thats the first role I knew her for.  absolute legend.
@thekingofruckus  same. but I didn t know who she was until many years later.
hale being on board should have been the ultimate clue - she s in high demand and doesnt sell her services cheap. the devs were clearly offering a reasonable salary.
jennifer hale  like shepard
so itsounds like she was mad cuz the main vo part went to jennifer hale and she got the minor session and she s throwing a tantrum. oh well  my pre-order is in the mail lol.
this reminds me of that ben shapiro clip of him talking about pencils.
bear in mind that is not uncommon for  actors .  alec guiness for example had to be given a helaciously good deal for him to agree to lower himself into playing obI won kenobi.  I think it actually gave him some of the merchandising profits even  of which there were millions.the catch 22 here is you have to understand your value.  as a voice actor  even one as iconic as bayonetta s  you are not alec guiness.  you have not won a tony  or an oscar  and you are not working on a product that has no star power and name recognition unless you participate.  bayonetta does not  need  her to be taken seriously.  star wars episode 4 did need alec guiness to be taken seriously.
much like with the strike a few years back  its mostly vas being pissed they dont get the perks of film and tv actors in residuals and stuff like that. which sucks I guess  but its part of the trade off since its not nearly as time consuming to do a va session for a few hours in a booth in whatever you feel like wearing vs having to show up first thing in the morning for hair and makeup and then spending all day on set  sometimes for months at a time if you ve got a major role in something.
@bob1986  yeah  but to remind people  the video game industry broke the union and the strike. the va s were starving. the dev studios kept on working. for hollywood movies and tv  the actors performance is the product being sold. they are the core of the business. with video games they are a minor extra value add. the product being sold is game play. the va s really dont have anything to do with that. you and I would be just as happy playing bayonetta as a silent protagonist. good voice acting is nice to have  and can elevate a game. but its not the core product. which is why va residuals is the line the industries line in the sand. the point they say no! get fucked to sag aftra. after months of striking the union settled for a contract worse than the one the industry had offered. the only things the industry gave them were things they probably would have given without the union. limited session times to not damage vocal cords. some safety and health stuff.
@karkarov  I didn t even know who hellena was until I watched this video. she isn t a household name. that in itself proves her current worth...which is substantially less than alec guiness. she was being unreasonable.
@andrew taylor  yeah  a game can still sell alot even if its voiceless... looks at pokemon... lmao. so game voice actors by default doesnt have a high leverage in the first place.
just for the point  15 hours was the recording session. she still had to study and create the character s personality  talking style and shit  so it was more than 15 hours work  but still nothing compared to devs sinking their life to be able to release the game.
@karkarov  actually  alec guiness only took the  sliding scale  because it was a common thing actors were offered for productions that were expected to be troubled. lucas had already offered everything else he had and the only thing he had left by that time was merchandising rights. honestly  the fact that guiness ever actually took that is surprising since historically  at that time  merchandising profit was always pretty low. but to your point  yeah  she was not as irreplaceable as she seemed to assume. while she was the voice of bayonetta  her voice isn t as distinctive as steve blum or david hayter or tony oliver  I can always point that dude out . heck  there were a lot of people who didn t even hear the change in the  bayo 3 trailer.
I did not ask for 250000   what an odd thing to say hellena  no one said you did....interesting.
as an aspiring va hearing 4 000 coming from that is awesome! Im a newbie but I look forward to make that much money in the future if I pursue this further.
she should ve just accepted the  15 000 - its very good money and bayonetta isn t even that popular.
@elias r ssel  its more than my annual income  in about 4 days of 4 hour recording sessions.
@henshinfanatic  I hope you dont live in a first world country with less than  15k  before taxes  a year
@mathieu s.  I do and Imanage. the utter destruction of pop culture is the main reason as so many things I once cared about went woke and I stopped spending anything on them. Imight not have a lot of cash  but I also dont have any debts and can live frugally. also my dollar is canadian so its worth about 70 cents usd.
she might get hired again  if some developer is banking on the  there s no such thing as bad publicity  angle. until all this stuff started  no one outside of some bayonetta fans even knew who this woman was. even if they were familiar with bayonetta s voice  they most likely didn t know the name of the voice actor. now  way more people know exactly who she is  she s pretty infamous at this point. some dev team will hire her to do a voice  and at the very least  it will bring more interest in their game than normal because   hey! thats the chick that lied to fans and threw shade at jennifer hale! what s she doing here  how is she still getting work!   something like that.not saying for sure that would happen  I can also easily see this killing her career outright. just saying I wouldn t be surprised if we see hear her again.
@losnf jslefn  it would be stupid because she basically used the internet to try and negotiate a higher wage. fuck that. and tbh 15k for what doesnt even end up being 40hrs of work is pretty good.
@ryan alt  sure it would be stupid. since when has thatstopped people in this industry  though
@elias r ssel  thats like  10k after taxes  its not  very good money
@thekingofruckus  I think thatshe also voiced black cat  in the spiderman  1994 animated series.
@sizemore  yep  she voiced fem-shepard.
@gameraGodzilla  she said she is  I believe. but if its the case swallow your pride and accept the  15k
not just any grievance  given this she could completely twist any minor thing she considers an insult to make the company look as bad as possible and call others to destroy it. like  she decides to go vegan  gets invited by boss and coworkers to a diner  says no she s vegan  boss says thats fine they probably have salads  then she goes online saying the company tried to force or trick her into eating animal products and hate vegans or some shit.
jennifer hale was outstanding as femshep
she was the voice of the female warden aka  hero of ferelden    additional voices in dragon age origins
@thekingofruckus  and the 1994 spider man cartoon
4k bucks for 15 hours of work that 266.66 dollars an hour for voice acting. Im in the wrong field of work
@pool oftim  its still very good money if you ask me. you have to keep in mind that bayonetta isn t a hollywood movie  but a niche videogame which on top only comes out on switch.
those that worked on the game got paid so dont worry about them.
@mad thing media  getting already paid wouldn t justify any reputational cost lost from the game being a potential failure were the boycott to have succeeded. hellena also pettily throwing shade at jennifer hale was uncalled for as well  for it got some misery-hungry activists sent her way after the fact  thus meaning her reputation is or was on the line too.
what reputational cost   the second she called for a boycott  pre-orders skyrocketed.  there s no damages to sue for.  if anything  taylor just ensured the game would succeed.
@fierysmile  yes  of course it did and will  which makes me happy to hear. hence why I wrote   were   the boycott to have succeeded  but let s say hypothetically if the reverse did happen - the game actually selling very poorly because of everyone blindly trusting her to the extent of wholeheartedly carrying out her request. then shouldn t there be reason to believe that the finished product s failure from that could ve further damaged the reputation of all those involved in making it besides  breaking an nda seems to be a big deal. so as things stand right now its looking like only hellena s may fortunately or unfortunately be taking a blow. least as far as trying to receive any other voice acting gigs in the future goes.
yeah  I wonder how much per hour the guys actually making the game are getting paid. people who have likely been working on games for 10  years.
@piranha plant  exactly. according to her union thatshe s a part of the minimum amount per hour  they can be paid is  250. she was going to stand to make  650 to  800 an hour seems pretty reasonable to me.
she s not even one of the more famous voice actors like troy baker or nolan north. or had any roles other than bayonetta. if she has a better voice acting resume like jenifer hale they might of given her more money.
I wish someone would pay me  15 000 to play a video game character. hell  I d take  5. hell  I d pay to do it!
Imake about 40 dollars an hour and Im moderately happy with it  good wages but price of living just seems to be skyrocketing lately so may need to start cutting stuff I like but dont need soon. 650 per hour would be amazing. even the 4k works out at something 180 dollars more if she s talking us and you need to convert that to  my currency. very unsteady work but I d be delighted to get paid that much an hour.
@art l  on top of this  she likely isn t expected to stay exclusive outside of the given hours. so she cantake on multiple jobs throughout the year  working less hours and getting more money than the guy busting his ass during crunch time.
@piranha plant  facts
@mr. s  alot of people would pay for that.
she was good  then she seems to have developed early onset dementia.
was it a difficult role
talent good  but as a person she s horrible and you shouldn t feel sad for her. its all on her.
its honestly hard to guess if she s good or not  when the only role she ever done is bayonetta.we dont know her range and capabilities outside of her bayonetta comfort zone. like she maybe is a one trick pony that can only do a bayonneta voice. lmao.
@bleachrush  Im more sad about the wasted talent since I doubt anyone would hire her after this.
@bleachrush  dont tell people what to do
what career
honestly  you didn t even have to wait to see issues with what she was doing. even at its face  it was simply a company making an offer and her rejecting it. no harm was done  so she was causing drama over a failed contract negotiation. the new information changes her from being whiny to downright malicious.
72 hour rule from 40k view works better than an emotional reaction every time.
her claiming bayo series was worth 450m before merchandise is already a red flag.
you shouldn t be sad. the only time we ought to truly feel sad for someone s career  ending  is when said ending happens inadvertently of the person itself. in helena s case  she herself was her own downfall and deserves no sympathy as a result  lmao.
actress  voice actors aren t actors  they re puppets.
but if she never worked on anything other than bayonetta... what work would there be for her to cry about
she wouldn t have done this if she was still a successful voice actress. she hasn t done anything in voice acting for 8 years  though. she s got maybe 25-30 roles total but hasn t done anything since 2014.because she doesnt have any roles anyway  destroying her future career over this didn t really matter  and she might get some virtue signalling out of it. she knows platinum wont say anything because even though she broke nda they still must abide by it.
@david conway jr.  more like platinum doesnt care enough to respond. if she broke nda they can sue her too and good luck single voice actor vs mid size gaming company
its all about her  didn t you know. this entitlement is getting crazy.
the game is a waste of money.
she really thought she could throw her weight around to pressure the company into folding with the threat of boycotting. stupidest thing when the game is far beyond her voice acting  replacements aren t hard to find and if the game is solid  people will still buy it because thats what they re paying for.
from what I heard in some leak gameplay  she did. its not too noticeable and Im pretty sure we ll get use to it.
hey bud. no matter what. never give up and never ever lose hope. I believe in you. praying for you brother. stay strong
yeah man  hang in there  try to ask help from God when your feeling down  it might not always happen immediately  but he will help you  dont be surprised if it comes as a change in your perception of your circumstances. also remember the greater the trial  the bigger the reward in heaven.
its easy to become bitter in a world thatseems so unfair. but its important to remember what you have. God put you here for a purpose man. I ll be praying for you. keep fighting the good fight. much love my brother in Christ.
you got this my dude. keep the faith and hold your head high. you have purpose and your life has meaning. prayers and good vibes my guy
much brotherly love from the u.s.a. to you. may God bless and keep you always. be strong  stay diligent.
we re all going to make it bro  keep on moving forward
find your voice  chonco kid!see how many have found this random comment and responded. ask God where he is and what he is doing in and around you . then share your story.  you ll find a strength and peace thatsurpasses understanding.  you ll become a name to be remembered!above all  your name is remembered before your God!
Jesus. only!
Im so glad that you find healing through these videos and a restored faith. its hard to become disabled at a young age and it cantake a person to a very dark place. I wasn t nearly as young as you are when I became too disabled to work almost 3 years ago  but I know it can be crushing to lose the ability to do things most people take for granted. God reaches for you when you need him most  sometimes in the most unexpected ways  like in a youtube video from an amazing content creator who likes cool things  but isn t shy about sharing her faith. I pray for your continued healing  whatever that might look like for you  and that you may continue find God and his blessings in the most unexpected places. you will find - or possibly already have found - that  with God  you are stronger than you can could even imagine. God bless
life is a battle  my little brother. the trick is to learn to enjoy the game of it.stay safe and commit to building something.
it was a pleasure meeting you here  bro. you got this. may God light your way for many years to come
thats what also made me suspicious.
4k would make sense if the amount of work was low which was the case here. think of it if you were paid 4k for a weeks worth of work would you say you were underpaid.
@ryan alt  that was proven to be a lie though.  as stated by hellena taylor  with her new statement   she was originally going to be payed 10 000  in total for her work.  but hidekI  helped to raise the amount to 15 000 .  which shows that no  she was going to be payed quite well  for a weeks work.
very true
maybe she s off her meds or something. its such a weird thing to do and could only have ended with a stain on her reputation.
@don fairfield  all corps need destroying  I take it you dont shop at any incorporated stores  or purchase any products made by corporations then  free speech means youre allowed to say things  it doesnt mean youre free from consequences or judgments.
@don fairfield  please explain. if you are buying things from corporations then you are choosing to benefit from their products or services which means they are useful to you.
this is not an rpg  this is an action game. Im sure her work would have been done in a few hours. being paid that much for a few hours of work is a Godsend.
Im so sick of the twitter court. there s been a lot of baseless accusations and things thatshould be handled by police   the legal system that Im forever jaded by anything on that website. top that off with the  crime  of wrongthink  twitter is just cancer.
this is the proof Ive been waiting for. thus  I also want to point the problem with both side  those quick to take her side and those quick to take jason s  sources  as gospel a few seconds after the fact. in the end  she was lying  but could also not be. so the moral is   dont take any side  until there s concrete proof about it .
notice how the lying wasn t what got people riled up.it was the associations.
this is why we should not be quick to align ourselves with the twitter mob lol
something always felt a little off  that I stayed out of it. at some point there is going to be that insecure manipulation that rises through social media. even though I would like the voice actress to continue being a part of the series without any trouble  this kind of entitlement devolves into nonsense.
loving all your videos! too many people scared to speak up these days.
its pretty sad how she didn t need to lie. everyone believed her and supported her until the real facts came out.
man was I rooting for her to. itsuck s honestly seeing this but its good that the truth finally got out. voice actors do and should get more though but what she was asking for seems so far out of possiblity tbh
first rule of actors  they are usually messed up and narcissistic and thats why they became actors...take anything they say with a grain of salt.
there s also the fact voices in games are a  nice to have . bayonetta could have been released without any localisation at all and it would still play the same. also hidekI kamiya probably thought she was being done wrong  but then got told the reality of the situation when he looked into it.
I saw this coming I know voice actors aren t paid to well yet 4000 seemed super odd and then I figured out that it would be per session and it clicked thatshe just wanted more money out of it than they were willing to pay
well said about how a person can simply move on or request more money. I took it at face value as it wouldn t have surprised me if a company low-balled someone.
I was wondering if you were going to talk about this. because before I was seeing mixed info. you make a lot of sence. there are people I agree with on some stuff but disagree on others. I agree we do need to research things better. Im glad you looked into it more and not just initial reaction like people do from time to time. thanks for the video melonie. until the next one.
I guess fans will be welcoming jennifer hale as the new voice of bayonetta with open arms. which is certainly a good thing of course!
thats too bad thatshe got caught lying. puts a bad mark on her and is going to make it just a little bit harder for other voice actors out there on certain projects if the shenanigans continue with others.
really great to put that out there  please get the whole story everyone  no matter what the politics  3 great video as always
this is why I never immediately take sides whenever something like this happens.
Imiss the old days...when someone just got made and released without all the drama...
taylor would have been better off looking for advice from tabitha st germain  ashleigh ball  tara strong  kelly sheridan  and other very talented voice actresses. I never realized how many voice actors I knew off the top of my head till just now.
this exactly. I dont think people are looking at it that way and have no clue what a flat rate is. they gave her a rate she tried to get more and probably shot way too high and basically told her to kick rocks. thats how negotiations go. instead of taking it at thatshe basically ruined her career because no one is now going to hire her if she is just going to run to twitter to try and pressure a company to get paid more
va are actually notoriously underpaid in the western area. she took that fact spun it out of control and attempted to use it to incite fan outcry. she not only destroyed her own career but potentially will make it harder for other vas to now get better deals.
thanks for your comments ..you ve been selected to claim a package congratulations!!! lucky winner.
no the moral is to check the politiks of the sides and choose the one of your politik team.
Im still waiting on concrete proof for either side because they both lied.
the problem is that even if we took her initial claim at face value. they made her an offer she didnt like and she rejected it. whether or not they lowballed her doesnt matter. they are not obligated to give her a desired rate and she isn t obligated to accept a given rate  end of story. her coming out and asking for a boycott over a failed contract negotiation looks bad on her no matter how you slice it.
@bowsette  there is no evidence so far that platinum lied
it was obvious thatshe was lying. the franchise is not making 450 million in revenue. not even close.
her 450m claim  was already a red flag  you dont need to wait for jason s report. she already used a random number to paint that  this is a big franchise
@kaimax_61  going by google sources  the franchise made close to 45m before steam. I trust she saw an extra zero in there.
yuuuup
I dont get why they should get more. they are kind of irrelevant when it comes to gaming.
that might be too broad a judgement  some people just have a talent or go into the family business  but everybody should be treated with skepticism.
@lawofimprobability  good point  they re not all crazy...just a lot  more than the average profession  I d wager.
my red flag was her being replaced by a much more in demand actress. why would they hire somebody obviously more expensive if they were stiffing people.
she isnt exactly putting in long hours either. she greedy af.
hoping this is an example. like all this should ve been done in private. va isn t the most stable job.
@c i  I agree. let the proper lessons be learned. as for the sustainable job part  not everything is guaranteed for the long run. even certain professions like a paleontologist have to take a second job just to make sure they can get by in life.
Imiss your verse of that day.  it was an awesome segment and such a smart idea to teach a connected lesson to the story you covered.
the fact that they were still willing to pay her for a cameo really shows that this company actually does care about their fans  and thats becoming a pretty rare thing to find these days
excellent vod  mel! its unfortunate thatshe lied. she will get her just deserts when she finds out that it will be even harder for her to get work now because of it as well as for the boycott she asked for. I suggested this topic in the go boom suggestions channel in the discord server around 3 in a half hrs ago.
what I find depressing is how the writers and the devs get paid nothing compared to voice actors. voice actors get on the low end like  250 an hour... while devs get what maybe 30  its insane.
you rock! thank you for providing more information than other people will take the time to do. if Imay...there s like a humming sound  that would be great to filter out.
lol I knew something was a bit fishy. look Im not defending companies they do most of their workers dirty a lot of times but something about this was just off to me. I was like  man  as she talks I feel like she is bullshitting me but I cant put my finger on why
as a labourer  I d love to take 2 months pay to sit in a sound booth.....actors  vocal or otherwise  need to understand how blessed they are...
she pretty much burned all the bridges in that industry and probably others
you would never think she could deliver a line after watching even just a part of those videos. good Lord.
not only I preordered bayonetta 3. I bought copies of 1 and 2.  and this is when reports of her getting offered 4k per session up to 5 sessions.  so I guess it help boost the sales
this just makes me hope for a trilogy to be available when 3 comes out.
whenever I feel there s  no good ones left I watch mel s videos  and feel hopeful. lol
the sad part is that the voice actress has a great voice.
at face value it was like  man thats bad step back  critically think   but they hired and paid one of the biggest vas in the industry. hmmmmmm
I d rather see the devs  who bust their tails working 18 hour days  then pay someone more than  1000 per hour to sit in an air conditioned studio and talk into a microphone for 4 hours.
thank you melonie   team     thank you for being so real
as a part time voice actor myself I jumped on her side because we are definitely underpaid on the regular. however  after learning the details she was clearly dishonest and manipulative. I do think  15 000 is chump change for a lead character in a big seller  but lying to make itsound even less has killed her hopes of support  and wrecked her future as a vo.
I knew something was up. always wait for the whole story!
was never a fan of bayonetta myself and had no intentional of buying any of the  but I hope this scandal doesnt cause ramifications with other voice talent and games. quality matters and I hope we dont see other devs walk away from good voice talent.
Ive been trying to figure out what sounds so familiar about your voice. when you said  you know what Imean   I pinpointed it. it isn t exact because the character is a bit nasaly  but the babysitter from the incredibles just a little bit. enjoying the content keep it coming!
all the charisma of a bowl of plain pasta
@ryan parker  lol  exactly.
I think 15k for between 18 and 24 hours of work is far from chump change.  most people dont make that inside of 2-3 months working full time and she was offered that for what amounts to 1 week of full time work.  I know it wouldn t be a full time week  but spread out a bit.  but there d be nothing stopping her from doing other work while on downtime from that project.
@mazzimo var  what people dont understand about the industry is that most of our work is finding the next work. we have to audition  audition  audition. its not like a 40 hr per week job with a regular pay. thats why it has to pay well  or nobody would do it  because after you account for all your training  studio equipment costs  weeks of auditioning for a short job  then onto more weeks of auditioning it wouldn t be worth it. its much the same with screen acting. you spend most of your time auditioning to maybe get a short spot on a commercial or ncis  and hopefully you get a break and get the lead on a film  which could be your only one for years. this was probably her only option for a lead character on a game for literally years  and its expected to pay well. for a  450m game  15 000 is a very weak offer. and voice work is much more grueling than an outsider would think.
bayo was never a big seller  thats the lie she s been trying to paint from the start.  450m number the bayo series finally reached a total of 3m life time sales in 10 years. animal crossing got over 100m in a week.
thanks for your comments ..you ve been selected to claim a package congratulations!!! lucky winner.
I admit I was considering cancelling my pre-order at least until we got the whole story and knew whether or not she was telling the truth.  guess that wont be necessary now.  also  cute dogs.
keep it up. I like how you talk about video game related news. I listen to you on my lunch break before going back to the grind.
3 15 yes! my thoughts exactly. if you dont like the amount of money they re offering  you can ask for more. but if they think its too much or its not worth it  then they can just find someone else. its called negotiation and ms. taylor has failed it.
she s obviously never read the art of the deal. never be afraid to walk away from a bad deal. be smart enough to recognize a good deal. if you walk away from a good deal then thats on you. whether or not she signs the contract is on her.why should consumers boycott a company and their product because she cant negotiate God bless melonie
Im just now getting into the bayonetta series in preparation for 3  really enjoying itso far.
her bs stunk from the moment she recorded that video. shame on her. she should issue an apology to jennifer hale. facts always come out also we need to stop believing everything we see on the internet as a whole
believe all women! thatslogan hasn t aged well.
it was always a bitsuspicious. if they d wanted to go with hale they needn t have offered her an insulting amount. they needn t have offered anything.
not that your gender is the main point of your channel and videos but im glad I found your videos so I can get a perspective of a female gamer on subjects that I enjoy  helps remind me that there are still people that are reasonable.
at this point the more she speaks the more of her career gets hit.
she sounds like someone who s always struggled and never had it easy
if there s one thing that I have learned from this is I need to get into voice acting. I d like to get some of that money
I dont understand the idea of lying about this stuff when you have to know someone is going to do some digging and out you  making you look terrible.  it happens often enough that nobody can really say they re ignorant of how this goes.and what does her call for a boycott actually do   say a lot of people did boycott the game.  did she think the developer was going to go back to her and beg her to voice it
yeah I was one of those people that would just fall for everything in my late 20 s early 30 s.now Ive become just very skeptical I just listen intently and try to verify. there s just so many extremes these days  but I too try to be supportive.
thatsucks. I really wanted to believe her cause I always root for the voice actors and hard working low level actors who can barely get a break. itsucks to have our emotions played with so easily from social media whiners.
damn she just set the va community back years
I laughed so hard when she said its an insult to her talent.
I cant believe I felt bad for her now this makes me wanna reverse boycott! that ll teach me to jump to someone s side before Ive heard the full story.
she was offered 15k and dared to say that wasn t enough. most people need to work nearly a full year just to earn that much. how much work would she need to put in for this game  days  weeks  a month  maybe two she should be thankful to have been offered that much money. I know I would love to make that much for so little work.
Im not gonna lie I feel a bit petty feeling good on this issue since some dude online was calling me some corpo lover online  yes he said corpo like he lives in cyberpunk  for saying the fact someone else took the job means something was up and them originally saying she was too busy was justified and the polite phrasing while her attitude was unprofessional.

amber heard killed what was left of that
thanks for your comments ..you ve been selected to claim a package congratulations!!! lucky winner.
she looks like she s going through something right now and she s lashing out. this was not a good move nor a good look for her career. there may be some underlying psychological problems.
to be fair  how many people blindly believe melanie and other social media outlets from the left and right  nobody has actually proven that helena taylor lied. she wanted a six figure deal and was still being offered peanuts. jennifer hale is still making huge money - more than taylor was offered. its interesting to see how 1  platinum games and hale wont talk about her rates  2  they wont talk about the specifics of the va deal and 3  they wont talk about franchise revenue and lifetime sales.
@true faith  Im afraid you make valid points  but I dont really follow this particular story so well  and I was making a large generalization without a lot of context. for all I know youre correct. I try to see things in an unbiased way  and if Im having a conversation person to person  it would be easier for me to tell their motives. conversations on text can be misunderstood and you dont really get the tone or feeling someone is expressing  in some cases.
@true faith  she already confirm herself that it was a lie.she said  bayo was a 450m franchice  bayo is nowhere close to that .she said  she was offered 4k to voice the full game   no  the bloomberg report and herself confirmed thatshe was offered 15k at first  the 4k after that was for a cameo  not the full game
no she didn t. by doing this she actually shined a light on a misconception people have about people in the acting business...as someone who knows something that performs professionally I sympathize with her because because actor of all disciplines aren t really paid that much.
making 15k a year is below poverty in the us
@marco genovesi  dude  that is a good price for the job. and you know what s good about being a va  is that you can voice in other projects too. instead of accepting the offer  she turn down the offer and didn t do other voice acting gigs. break the nda and complain the price is low. well  she wont get any va job anymore though.
@marco genovesi  va jobs for a game like this will not take up all of your time for the year. if we actually compared it to expected work hours  she s earning hundreds of dollars an hour  and she has time to work on other projects.
@faI cry  what did I say  I said 15k per year is below poverty. Im not talking about vas.thatsaid afaik she was on her way out anyway and bayonetta was her last gig.
@piranha plant  where in the Lord s green earth I said this va job should take one year. Im just commenting on op s statement that  most people need to work nearly a full year to earn 15k   by saying that people with such low income are below poverty level in the usa
@faI cry  what  right word   I said  15k per year is below poverty in the us  and thats a fact. Im just commenting on op s statement that  most people need to work a full year to earn that much Im not talking about her  or vas in general
@marco genovesi  okay. so you that type of person huh. good on you. 15k a year indeed makes people below poverty.
being she proy lived in a city where rent is 3000 a month for even small shitty places  she s probly living a little better at 4 or 5k amonth. so 15k isn t that much. its socialist societies that destroy us and raise prices. 15k for me would be wonders where I live. but not in calI or europe. socialist places that is.
@faI cry  exactly like most voice actors actresses have multiple roles a year. she should ve built up a resume.
if youre barely making over  15k a year at a full-time job  you did something wrong.
for 24 hours of work  3 full days  that would be  650 hour. three freaking days.
15k for one gig come on that is good money right there. if she is so talented should could pick up another gig and get paid another 15k  then another  then another then another.   fuck she could be making good money for only having to work 5 times during the year
@marco genovesi  a year    we are talking about 5 das of work  4 hours a day .
@raskolnikov  which to a normal person isn t even 3 days of real work. she s basically getting paid 1k dollars an hour for voice acting in a video game. its on her if she cant fill out her schedule to make enough money to live.
its sad that anyone took the side of a person that basically tried to sink the entire boat of a team of people that worked years on this game just for her own selfish reasons and then had the nerve to attack jennifer and then continue to contradict herself after being caught in a lie. as a huge fan of this game I am so happy to see the sales of this game sky rocket on amazon
good on u for waiting to get more info  something sadly lacking in media  whether its journos or other media
david hayter will always be the voice of snake.
I learned my lesson... again. I was like this before but because I really liked hellena taylor s work I was with her  but again this happens. and yes she just murder her small voice acting career she had.
they should sue her  4 500.00 for defamation.
first thing that popped into my head when this crap broke was   how many hours of work are we talking about here  .  anything under a week .thats good money!  then  just like youre saying  dont burn bridges girl!
its been a trend for several years where voice actors are getting too big for their britches. the one thatsurprised me was phil lamarr.
melonie   I d like to share 3 opinions I have. I have watched ur channel for a bit and love ur content and how u deliver it. 1st  you are a female gamer which I love and wish I saw more of yourepresented on u tube.   2nd ...ur very intelligent and very good at expressing ur views on a subject.  3rd   you are a very attractive woman... and a tomb raider fan . I remember when the first raider came out and my friend and I would call each other and ask  where u at    a friendly competition.  good times. also   love ur tattoos. gonna sleeve the other arm
considering that nintendo hasn t been advertising super hard for this game  at least compared to some of their other big releases this year   its kinda hilarious how this situation has essentially been a ton of unintentional publicity that got bayonetta 3 on a lot of gamer s radar. not sure this will actually boost the sales much  but its definitely not hurt the sales. my only hope is that people wont start being critical of all voice actors because of taylor s poor decision here.
the next time helana taylor gets any kind of paid voice-over work   welcome to mcdonald s drive-thru  how may I help you
so... she is allowed to complain about the offer. however she did hide some facts   15gs is a lot more than  4gs and she was given this offer first  but declined so they gave her the piss off offer. she gambled for more money and lost. thanks for the information. that does shed new light on the situation.
boycot this game because Imade a decision based upon my wants and desires and the company made a business decision. no. no my dear  I wont be doing that. you made a decision and now you must live with it.
even if she wasn t lying and actually was a victim  its not ok to try to tear down a project that hundreds of people have worked hard on just cause they didn t want to pay you as much as you wanted. their work also matters. I personally love jennifer hale  so I dont think this will be difficult for players. kiefer as snake got backlash but I think his voice aged well and I think jennifer will too.
if you need to learn how to talk to a lady  dont ask hellena taylor.
you ve quickly become one of my favorite gossip streamers lol
she was offered more than Imake in a year for 20 hours work...
I think your mic is picking up your fan     do you have a fan on the floor next to your desk    or your mic stand is touching a wall that is adjacent to your ac unit...etc.  there is a variable resonance  its very low  that your mic is picking up...idk....just looking out  d  edit   love your content fyi
I was rooting for her to start with because for the longest time now a lot of the talented artists  animators  actors etc that work under large corporate umbrella s tend to get paid quite poorly considering how much the franchises make.but the whole boycotting angle seems a bit much and is not fair on the thousands of other people that worked hard on the game that did not have any issues.
taylor    4 000 is an insult to me and my talents james woods anytime he reprises hades   I ll do it for free
this is funny  she got canceled by the cancel mob while trying to cancel a game.
I think people dont really understand her videos. the listening skills are very poor. I cant believe people are still defending platinum games and demonizing hellena taylor. I cant believe people are happily defending a greedy corporation. melania got this story all wrong. lol
its not a piss off offer tho  4k for  few lines  is a lot of money. if 4k for up to 5 sessions  1 hour session   then her hourly rate would be 800  and more for less session if she did it quick.
@cwingnam  for a few lines  sure  but the offer was still more if a  piss off  because she wasn t the main anymore.
oops. I had some box fan sounds playing on the tv in the living room so the dogs would calm down because they were upset my parents stepped out lol  parents and their dogs are staying at my place while they look for a new house out here . I didn t realize it would be picked up from my office
@melonie mac go boom  omg thats so cute and I cant believe I nailed it haha  love it.   also loved that you said  Im a Christian...not a fan of joel..   haha I was like ok she s legit  3  d  keep up the good work!!  we have no time for charlatan s and you are so refreshing.  please keep hustling  I truly believe you are going to blow up.  you have to.  cheers.
yeah  her claim that bayo series was worth 450m  was already a redflag for me thats she s lying. the bayo series was never a high seller  only reaching 3m life time sales  after 10 years. even if we re generous and times that with full price   60  it wouldn t have even reached 200m  not to mention costs are not accounted too.
she lost me when she said that basically she made the bayonetta character  and the new voice actress should not sign autographs because shes not the original bayonetta  like wtf game writers developers  programmers be like  are we nothing to you!
I dont like to jump to conclusions. also  wussification of james bond.
honestly its the gameplay that makes the game..if the game sucks the voice acting is not a game changer
worst part is hidekI got flamed and harassed off of twitter for a little bit - all for some lies. the one positive is this did at least seem to bring attention to anime voice actors who are criminally underpaid. hopefully some good will come from it
the first shred of doubt was when she was naming bayonetta s sales. as a huge fan  I know that the series is very niche and not that popular.  most people are well aware of the trouble platinum has with getting not just bayo 2 but most of their games out the door. its why I have no problems with the company sticking so heavily to their sugar daddy  nintendo since the company lets them do whatever they want.second  was the rate. again  platinum  especially when they were previously clover studios  has a history of being shafted. so  the idea of the company low balling her seemed amazingly hypocritical to me. Imean  kamiya had his games series taken from him and learned about it when he was working on translating the previous title. I realized then thatshe prefaced with the statistics to make itseem that bayo was aaa game and should be paired with the likes of the next legend of zelda game or gta. the reality is that the game is at most mid-market which would put it at bloodborne levels. by that Imean that if it wasn t a nintendo game  it would be around  20 by the end of the year. like the first one was for a lot of people. heck  I picked it up originally that price for my ps3 in 2010. the final nail came in when she started complaining about her replacement. jennifer hale not only had a long list of roles and awards  but she is also one of the major champions thatspearheaded va industry reform. one of her major platforms was on the better pay of voice actors and better working conditions. it was this that made me look up what was the standard rate of union work and I realized thatshe was mostly talking out of her butt.  1k per hour in 4 hour intervals is the standard. I also found where she stated that it only took her around 4 seesions to complete bayo 2.
this is why you never use emotions in cases like this  first you need to wait and see what is really going on... its not the first time  for some reason we got few groups of people  people mm... take them at their word I think this is how you say it in eng. . no proof needed  circumstantial stuff at best  not even circumstantial most of the time.
people lie. its our most consistent and defining feature  the other being that we pretend to be surprised when lies are revealed.  most people aren t dumb enough to expose their own lies so publicly
I love how she mispronounced jason chihuahua on purpose
pretty happy I didn t jump on the platinum games hate bandwagon. seeing as though itseemed kinda fishy she was releasing these videos a week before the game released. lol
what u said around 3 40 is what monique really needed to hear during her whole netflix fiasco
you gained my respect when you explained your views  without going too in-depth. I dont like joel either. you are making great content! keep it up!
a simple no would suffice unless they lied to you and bound you by contract . if you can say no then your credentials speak for them self
I d be over the moon if I could earn  15-20k just from yelling into a mic for 15 hours.plus jennifer hale is a legend... more recognition than ht.
one thing I know from all this my respect for jennifer hale knows no bounds.
if youre gonna break nda...well  first of all  probably dont. but if you are going too  maybe lying about misrepresenting the situation  and calling for a boycott is probably not a great way to do so...what bothers me the most is the group of people that took her word for it  then proceeded to swarm hidekI kamiya s twitter  ultimately causing him to delete it  then celebrating him doing so... then when this came out  and they mention nothing about that and post shit like  well yeah hellena may have lied  but itstarted a great discussion about va pay.
all those years of acting training  didn t take econ 101  theory of supply and demand  as an elective.
this is just another reason why I gave up trying to be a voice actor .
atleast they didn t model the character after her.
lesson of the day  you can either have 15k dollars in your hand  or none. as beyonce once said   so dont you ever for a second get to thinking youre irreplaceable
react immediately!  and ignore the other shoe when it drops!  thats the way of social media  today s version of bower of bliss.
voice acting doesnt make games good. it can benefit them  but its absolutely not necessary. I honestly miss the days before voice acting in rpgs  the dialogue options were generally more creative and offered more branches.
noticing when children lie is an important point in childhood development as it indicates when the child understands that there is a difference in perception between people. realizing that people lie is part of recognizing their common humanity and agency.
she really is among the best in the industry.
@raskolnikov  your comment got censored
hely  melonie. youre at 80 000 subscribers  nice one. also you taught me its always okay to love franchises even if they go to hell  like your love for tomb raider and my love for halo.
vic mignogna was on flashcast and basically said voicing in anime and games is for those who love the business and not in it for the money.   I do feel that these actors get paid for so little on these vastly popular aaa titles  but this isn t hollywood where star power is putting people in seats.   va are part of the team like the animators.   perhaps in the future the animators and va s get a bonus if the game does real good.
va lies twitter  sleepsva likes cops and follows people they dont agree with twitter  fully woke
notice she is a voice actress but made a video response.
I saw quarterings video on this and my first thought was there was something shady. nice to know my instincts still work.
so her ego was so offended   and she thought this was the best way to deal with it
either way Im still getting the game
I just noticed the gojira kanjI tattoo. thats legit.
I still do think certain voice actors should have higher value put on them. the video game industry is bigger than hollywood itself.... so regardless  I still think they are robbing many people with what they are paid.
of all the place she could have come out it is cesspool twitter  not only thatshe didnt tell the full story too. she put a nail in her own coffin.
melonie mac should try voice acting her voice is cute
yeah  basically the entire internet said  Im gonna need more information before I take a side.
I sadly just assume all english voice actors are liars or scumbags. especially after how they treated vic years ago.
4 000 treats for doggo cameo.
well said melonie
she lied ! what !
on bayonetta voice actress part  she s right about one thing  voice actors dont get paid nearly enough for the work they do. they can be considered the star of the show  and only be paid diddly squat.
its sad what has happened to hollywood and the actors
melonie love your content what s your thoughts on yakuza games and shenmue
if she asked for 6 figures  thats insane.
most aren t even good. I regularly use the japanese vas  when offered  just to get professional level work.
voice acting is one of those industries Ive been disillusioned with over time. the japanese dubbing industry is competitive and culturally important enough for actors to actually put a lot of effort into voicing characters. while over here  Im certain individuals are more dependent on personal connections in landing roles meaning they may not have to work as hard. doesnt mean there aren t potentially good people in voice acting  its just Im a lot more skeptical. itseems like an industry that facilitates falling in line with a certain way of thought or being blacklisted like in hollywood.
@rambleon07  dear God that their vas are good. even a side character can hit all the right note in a script!
how is this hollywood
hImelonie I hope yourweekend was really good toyou as always I enjoy learning interesting topicsthat you cover. takecare melonie
fye  the video you played of the actress talking is so quiet I cant hear it. like only 20  of your own voice volume.
my theory  platinum games want to re-hired her for the 3rd  negotiation happen  around  4000 payment per recording session  which based on calculation require 4 to 5 recording sessions. but then they background check her career history on va  and its shocking ... she has no va job since 2014  so platinum questioning her quality for 5 years absent in voice acting. then platinum games decide to contact another talent and they get one of the best who still active in va career  jennifer hale. out of respect  they offer hellena some small role which only have 1 recording session   the  4000 .
I am still in the wait and see category. I think there is a lot of trash on both sides we dont know and I think we are just seeing bad blood spill over.Im not taking sides here
not surprised she is terrible with numbers after saying bayo made 450m.... thatsmelled like bs too
melonie is one of the only youtubers I watch who didn t immediately side with her on this. griffin gaming said this before anyone else was last week or so and people got mad at him. well lookey lookey
they wanted her to design and develop the entire game for only 4000 thats crazy.
greed is one hell of a drug
isn t there a legal issue with her being dishonest when talking to the public about the company  that kinda sounds like grounds for a lawsuit against her.
me giggling at all the folks who cancelled their preorder
I called this from the beginning and got dog piled for it.  people said I was a nintendo and or platinum games simp  Ive never played bayonetta.  it doesnt interest me.  it looks like a devil may cry sort of game to me and thats not my thing .  I first saw this story on g g and jeremy immediately sided with hellena without thinking things through  in my opinion.the first thing I said was that I would bet thatshe was going to have to do about two weeks worth of work and I asked if the expectation was that one 2 week gig should pay for your existence for a year  two years between gigs  which would be tough since hellena apparently hasn t booked a voice acting role since 2014 .  it turns out I was overestimating the amount of  work.   it was actually four hours per day for less than a week.anyway  Im rambling.  point is  I feel vindicated.  I just try to be objective.   thats the sound of me patting myself on the back .
nice to see the sailor jupiter hairstyle back.
Im not happy with the offer to be a part of of it  so I think the whole project should be ruined! damn  didn t know bayonetta was such a karen
she just did a massive disservice to all vas.
no matter how thin you make a pancake itstill has two sides. - dr. phil
0 04  tiny dog enters room.me  waits entire video to see tiny dog again.
melonie should be the voice actress for butternetta
please  tell me that Im not the only that thinks thatshe s like a female version of critikal btw  about this drama Im happy that it ended with hellena being exposed  such a great satisfaction .
I could tell in her initial videos thatshe wasn t telling the whole story as she didn t say what her initial offer was  which sounds like it was the 15 - 20k offer. if she felt like she was worth more than that then kudos to her but my understanding from other videos on this matter is that the 15 - 20k offer is the going rate in the industry.
the thing that irks me is she compared herself to a nurse
same. I actually love the license and helena s taylor s voice as the character  but this was shady. everything else  after that  just made it look more and more obvious thatshe was not genuine in her claims.
my calling
@melonie mac go boom
is bayonetta still a hot ip  maybe the va thinks it is but the developers dont  so it doesnt justify paying the amount she s asking for.be it as it may  it doesnt surprises me thatshe distorted the truth... what surprised me were people defending her right off the bat. I agree with you.
my opinion on this situation is I work two jobs at a total of about twelve hours a day five days a week and monthly I bring home about 3k so she s complaining about 4k for a few days work Im like wow I wish I could get that much I d be sitting pretty over hear at 4k a month so basically I just didn t give a crap
it is difficult to pick a side in this scenario  that being said...Im not buying the game  for personal reasons  empty wallet syndrome
it doesnt matter how much training you had  youre only worth what youre worth.  so if she wanted more    she should negotiate for more.
whenever I see a story thatsays   we totally got trump this time! he s going down!  ...Ive learned to always wait 2 or 3 years to see if the claims and predictions come to fruition.  still waiting  in the entertainment world  its a little easier  you just have to hold off on commenting for 2 or 3 days.
I saw the articles and titles of videos from last week and thought there was definitely some details missing from the story. itseemed too ridiculous to be true.
Im curious how much the programmers and design artists are being paid. curious indeed
she wanted her piece of the pie
I agree with the actress.for the vast majority of americans wages have been on the decline in the last 40 years while production of workers has been rising.the more people speak up and shame these corporations the more this might change.as unlikely as that may be.I consider myself a center-leftist but I think its good to see more conservatives understanding that corporations are not our friends.
company  here s  10.000her  thats too low  I want morehidekI  ok  here s  15.000her  no  I dont want to work with youher  why are they not responding after I said I dont want to work with them
would say she has destroyed her voice acting career but seeing as she has not done anything else apart from bayonetta in the last ten years there was very little to destroy. probably the most unprofessional and undignified way she could have handled this  pride before a fall and all that.
yep I agree if she s having having trouble finding work calling for a boycott as she wasn t offered enough is not going to help her find it.
people need to stop simping for everyone who posts a tweet about how they were  mistreated  by some company. you think of you went into her twitter complaining you didn t make what you thought you were worth  she would give you the time of day   ridiculous.
to be fair she does have a very nice voice.
I deserve trillion   for voicing video games for few days because Im a whaman
I say it before and say it agane she wanted blood  without realizing her blood was the one shed
yet another reason I never bother with twitter lol unless its for contests or video game sales.
never believe anything from social media
well  she basically ensured that no game developer will hire her again lest she call upon the twitter mob to cancel their game because she s dissatisfied with their offer.
as soon as I watched her vid I knew she was lying  that is a comicly low amount.
its extremely easy. one side blatantly lied about a generous offer while the other didn t.
@raskolnikov  there is that issue...deception is a slippery slope  that along with her reaction  making the fight a public issue only compounds that. still not buying the game though lol
also legal ownership of the franchise. k thnx bye
first comment
3 10  the reasoning for calling for a boycott was that the offer was way too low for any voice actor  such that it was just a dishonest way for them to fire her. if it was true  it would ve made perfect sense to be upset  as it would ve been a shitty thing for them to do to her.
she didnt lie she just didnt give the whole story. that being said I feel like 15k is a low ball. based off of how popular the game is and how much money it has made over the last two editions. she never said what she asked to get paid. I am more curious about that.
even if you didn t have the title  I still would have thought she was lying. 4k is an amount that I could comfortably afford  so Im unable to take itseriously.
remember when the only time people got mad at bayonetta was because she had a ridiculously unfair advantage in smash bros
she knows how to use google translate!
helena taylor helped the bayonetta franchise make hundreds of millions of dollars. she created an iconic voice that defined an iconic character. none of you would be happy with a  4000 rate  given how profitable the game was. do you think jennifer hale is getting that low-ball amount  of course not. lol. hale is getting paid much more. japanese business culture usually doesnt fire people. they ll make an insultingly low offer  hoping that you walk away  so that they can hire someone else. jennifer hale is a larger voice acting star  which marketing can use to drive more sales. helena taylor clearly states that it was a rate. a rate. lol. when did you guys start to support big corporate companies  when did you guys like screwing over the little guys  finally  voice actors  in general  get paid very low. they tried to go on strike  in the past  to get higher pay and residuals  but it failed. this was a bad video.
with all of the batman s or joker s or spidermans... none of them are going out and saying  hey  I was the first spidy bat jokey... you cant sign off on stuff at conventions as being  x  character... I was first! right from the get-go  she seemed very untrustworthy.also  I believe this is an excellent case study of how to shoot one s career down the toilet. because any company can look at this and decide if they even want to deal with her.
no one survives the purity test.
welp I bought them on wiI unow Im getting the trilogy full price to spite her
I held my judgement and glad I did  itseemed weird for platinum to offer her so little then hire a va who would be far more expensive. something clearly stank in paradisio.
and then you wonder why less and less people believe people who come out with their issues abuse etc ..
aquaintences of mine were reeing so hard about it on the day she dropped the vids platinum bad  va fucked over  etcthe moment I got about 10 secs into the first vid I told them  she bullshittin  and went digging to everything such as union minimum payments etc and explained how she probably got offered 4k an hour and shes misleading on purpose but even a flat 4k was more than the minimums the union allowed for the time she was going to do  basing my analysis on bayonetta 1 and 2 voice acting times  naturally they didn t believe me.then all the news was coming forward  15k offered and she asked for 6 figures and I relayed this like  look I was right these people risk libel and their reputations and some are so damn pro union that they have no need to lie . they still didnt believe me!today there was a new post in the thread of people calling me a liar and a piece of shit to va s and uncaring etc etc and itsimply read  sorry kyte turns out you were right      now I dunno if itsays something bad about me or the world that I instantly thought it was bs but it doesnt even feel fun to say  I told you so  anymore d
everyone started defending her and I feel like I was the only one saying wait for more info to come out or for platinum to respond. but everyone jumps the gun. the shitty thing is these yt streamers aren t apologizing for assuming  they are shifting blame to her now. it would be great for a content creator to say they ll be more patient next time  maybe wait for a receipt or something
never bite the hand that feeds you.
itsounds to me like she was trying to weaponize the twitter mob in hopes of twisting her boss s arm into offering her more money. the attempt was just terrible
reminds me of when sarah silverman claimed some comedy club paid her less than the male comedians and it was a 100  lie.
hellena said she was offered 4k  then she got caught in 4k. oh the irony... and the poetry.
well  since she admitted thatshe omitted the first offer she got  which is  15k  and only mentioned the last offer she got   4k  she really weakened her position significantly ... quite sad  she should have mentioned the full story from the beginning.
glad I waited. I wasn t sure. I dont trust anyone anymore.
4k rate was only for a cameo after they already replaced her. also she did not make an icon and the director told her how to do the voice. also it has at best made 120 million only if every single copy sold  60 over the franchise s life span  note this is not a popular game franchise .  with the info she was giving out today she was offered 15k 4 times the union rate. now she pointe out it would have been 5 sessions. a session is 4 hours so she turned down 750 h. for only 20 hours of work. that is more then most people in the us make in a year.
@flameknightdragon  how much do you think jennifer hale is getting paid  I guarantee thatshe s getting paid much more than taylor. robert downey jr gets paid a lot of money as an actor to make movies  which make a lot of money. hellena taylor should be compensated appropriately for her role and job in the entertainment product. voice actors aren t  regular people   just like Christian bale and dwayne johnson aren t  regular people . the bayonetta franchise had two games  was re-released on several platforms  had physical sales  playstation  xbox and nintendo  and was sold on several digital storefronts  playstation  xbox  nintendo and steam . bayonetta also became even more popular and sold more units after she was included in smash bros. it made a lot or money. during contract negotiations  platinum games would have to disclose franchise performance. every agent would request and receive sales information  especially if youre trying to negotiate residuals. platinum games hasn t released any up-to-date lifetime sales for the franchise. and jennifer hale hasn t revealed how much money she s earning. they re both as quiet as a church mouse. total silence from both of them.
platinum games were feeding helena taylor scraps. I guarantee you that jennifer hale is making six figures from this voice acting gig.
just say she lied.
@brad dl  oversimplification is for the weak minded  what she said was true  but it wasn t the full truth.
give me the one and only atsuko tanaka!!!! the original voice of bayonetta!!!
that actress seems to be under the impression that there is people  as in one person  that bought the games because of her. well  its not true  love. she did a great job  but who the hell buys a game because of the voice actor  especially a action game.
wait  does she say 5 thousand or 50 thousand in her tweet  there s a coma after the 5 but there are four zeros
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that you are doing great job with each of these videos and I am so truly happy and blessed to be your friend and follow you on twitter and on twitch and youtube. anyway keep it up and hope you continuing to well with these types of videos each day and every year  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that I have a big problem with how bayonetta voice actress got the part of the game and turns around and get everyone from the game company get busted for not paying her for playing the voice part of the video game. anyway I just dont think that it was a right and smart idea and thing to do but I guess she will find something else to do for her next job in future  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to make a comment about this video and I just wanted to tell you that you are doing fantastic and great job with making this type of videos everyday and every year. anyway keep it up and I am so happy for you melonie. anyway hope you are doing well with yourself and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and with your parents and family melonie. anyway have a great evening and good night.
so as a lay person  I have no idea where  4k lands on the pay scale
I feel if she was hurting for money so bad she just took the job regardless how she was getting paid she s still getting paid a lot of money I understand she got to go what she work but if youreally need help and desperate for money just take the job not a lot of people  have the luxury like she do
I can understand voice actors grievances regarding their payment and how they get no additional paydays regardless of how well the game sells  God knows that big games companies definitely would have enough money to pay them some extra ...but lying about the payment and then basically refusing to say anything on the issue anymore saying  I just  want to move on!  is not a way to have a positive impact on the industry  surely..
she s blinking three times a second... and youre saying she s lying
this is a great lesson to not jump on the hate wagon. she knew how the fans would respond and she s 100  a bitch for sending the mob after platinum. hopefully after this people will learn to wait for more details.
if I were hiring voice talent  I would definitely steer clear of this woman. running to twitter to generate bad pr for the game seems unwise to me. I wonder if she thought they d offer her more money or if she was just mad at the low offer and didn t care about burning any bridges.
did she really think this was gonna help her in the end  its sad  man- sometimes you just gotta take it on the chin.
I learned about this late and Im glad I did   since I would have definitely sided with her. a lesson from this atleast is to examine the evidence and the other side s claim.
and yet jeremy from quartering wanted her to get pay  500 000 for video game voice acting...
if this game doesnt sell at least 8.9 million copies  what would be the primary reason
if anyone should get royalties for a game its the developers  because they re the ones who are putting in the true work.
a lot of people must be feeling like s  right now
after seeing the initial video and knowing nothing of the bayonetta series  I was skeptical  but I was leaning towards trusting her. definitely not now.
these people are really nuts. what was the plan here  that they come crawling to her to kiss her feet and offer her million of bucks  man  the delusion is strong on this one.
I dont really know how much money voice actors make...but my initial thought on this story was that even the 4k offer sounded...ok   its more than like a quarter of the country makes on a monthly basis...Imean I dont know how many hours of work it would take but its not like voice actors do one gig a year...Imean maybe thats the dream but it doesnt sound tenable to me
immediately when I saw this story and watched her vids  I had two thoughts. one  even if they low-balled her on the offer. its a non story  because she isn t obligated to accept and they aren t obligated to hire her again. there is a lot more that goes into game development than just voice acting. Im not boycotting a game because a voice actor didn t get a rate they wanted. two  theatrics like this immediately make me wonder if there is more to the story. narcissists will typically drum up crap like this because they didn t get her way. I wouldn t be surprised if she hit them with some absurdly high offer first that they rejected.
simping is unhealthy  my friend
completely nuts. there would be no new bayonetta game if va was that expensive.
bayonetta one and two have sold around 3 million copies combined.
to he fair  japanese game developers have their fair share or narcissists  no different than western developers . most people would agree  if you worked hard to help a business succeed  bayonetta franchise   then you would expect to enjoy in the rewards of more products  increased sales  etc. or maybe people just selectively decide when they blindly support big corporations
@karma queen  can you clarify what your point is  first you mention that there are some narcissistic japanese game developers. yeah  and  what is the relevance here  I know narcissists exist all over. that doesnt mean she gets a pass for being a narcissistsecond  Im not really sure what youre trying say here  aside from the bit of blindly supporting corporations. Im not  but im not blindly trusting individuals either. Im just looking at the situation for what it is and saying what I think.
this is why you always wait for more info now if you excuse me I ll be laughing at all the fools who cancelled there preorder for queen bayonetta
what in the world was she thinking in sabotaging her own career by lying by omission in the first place  she has lousy business negotiation skills or she s just nuts. all that is left of her future is flipping burgers in a fast food joint or working as a clerk in a grocery store. she could have just swallowed her pride  taken the offer and shut up. she d be lucky enough if the company doesnt sue her for damaging their image by defamation.
while I agree that nowadays so many are ready to jump on the righteousness bandwagon  and you know  maybe wait for more information before making assumptions  its worse if it turns out the person you thought was a victim turns out to be a liar and  not  stop supporting them  or worse  double down.   woke  has become a point of mockery for some  but the root of it is being willing to call out problems in society and the way we treat people rather then  not all  insert here   or  oh its not that bad .that being said  her lying only hurts other voice actors  ultimately in a field where they are undervalued and underpaid. good riddance. hope she gets snubbed in her acting as well.
I loved hellena taylor as bayonetta she was amazing but after this I feel so let down by her and I am not sure if I want to come back as bayonetta in the future.her replacement jennifer hale is an amazing voice actress and will definitely be able to be a good bayonetta but she will put her own spin on the character while it wont be a bad thing I will be missing hellena s unquie charm.it could work for bayonetta 4 as in bayo 3 there are multiple different bayonetta s and the main one we will play as looks younger and jennifer hale sounds younger so of bayo 4 had the original come back it would make sense if hellena taylor voiced her.having seen the leaked first 10 minutes of bayonetta 3 it does sound like hellena taylor is voicing the original bayonetta at the beginning of the game the likely the cameo role but jennifer hale is voicing the main version of bayonetta in bayo 3 which makes sense as like itsaid bayo 3 looks younger than the original bayonetta from 1 2 who seems to be voiced by hellena taylor who does sound older.so did she start recording then turn down the rest of the job over pay or did she work out her differences with platinum and accepted the offer for the cameo I hope she did work out thing with platinum games and apologies for what happened I think the fan would eventually come forgive her as I hope I cantoo but I honestly she would have to do itsoon.
you and vara both posted this story at the same time.
well  I partially agree with melonie on this one. I agree that its not quiet  good taste  to screw your former employer online trough twitter for not paying you enough this time around. although the question really is  what should one do  if an extremely famous company  only pays peanuts for for a prime role in an extremely famous franchise  should you accept that  they are basically try a dumping price on you  well in my personal opinion  that would really depend on how far off a reasonably well payed amount  they would be with their offering. and whether its an increasing trend in the industry  because that might really become a problem...sometimes companies really would need a lil pressure from the outside  to make them clear that they are treating their employees like  sh t .but as melodie pointed out... there are always two sides...  and taylor sure didn t better her  public position  by not mentioning her initial offer...but what I would point out that according to backstage .com  the average payment for a voice actor in games is 200-350 usd hour on average  maybe even higher in this case .so considering that  the initial 10.000usd would be roughly payment for  28 working hours... and Im not sure that that would be enough for an entire game  or an adequate ratio for such a popular franchise. though I have no idea what amount of lines we are talking about in the end.
this was very suspicious from the beginning  this game was announced for the first time in 2017  why would she only spoke out now  a few days from release
Im glad thatsee has a career in broadway as a back up  Imean primarily
hellena taylor is the living embodiment of  bret screwed bret. if you know  you know.
so they decide not to go with her for the original part and use another actor to voice that original part .. then offer her a different less valuable one session cameo job for a different amount .. she then says they offered her that cameo fee  for an entirely different job  for doing the original larger job .. ok  she lied .. slam dunk.she had two separate offers for two separate jobs  she turned down both jobs  is what it boils down to  no harm no foul on either side.until she decided to lie.
15 000 is pretty substantial for what it is. thats like at least a months work in the studio and then youre done. most people barely get by with 4 000 month in wages. my guess is she wasn t getting enough work from multiple sources and got desperate to milk a single studio. obviously  that didn t work out well for her.
dang I canceled my pre-order for nothing!
I glad I actually waited for both side of the stories knowing how entitle some people are....not even fan of the game....now makes me wan to buy it just to support it
4k to 15k may seem like a lot to her  but she d be getting royalties from every game sold...
welp......its good to be vindicated once again. called this story b.s. the moment I heard it.
I figured that that was too good to be true...
this publicity will turn into more sales of the game
why is she so delusional to think that just because she spent 7 years training to be a voice actor she deserves more
maybe she misunderstood the offer
not going to lie even if she said had been true I still wouldnt boycott the game because of it. I dont care thatshe was unable to get the amount of money she wanted to voice the role. bayonetta is a good game  like why would I boycott it. has nothing to do with me.
the offer was  3000 per recording session. each session is 4hrs with an estimate of 5 sessions needed. thats  15k total over 5 days or 20 hrs total. that comes out to  750  per hr. that wage to hr ratio is significantly higher than everyone else who is working on the project. also to add  unlike other aaa games hellena isn t doing mo-cap on top of va-ing. a different person is doing bayo s mo-cap. she is basically doing even less work than the vas who did last of us for example. lastly  bayonetta isn t as popular as you think it is. bayo 1 actually performed poorly. platinum had no interest continuing the franchise. bayo 2 exists because nintendo used their own money to revive the ip. bayo 2 barely did better than bayo 1. fans had to wait 8 years for bayo 3 because financially it isn t as good as hellena makes it out to be. her valuation of  450 million  makes no sense. even if bayonetta made  450 million in sales  that is not pure profit. not even close.
any one who says they want  to move past  after starting the mess to begin with  was lying and was caught.
if I ran a company  the first requirement would be that the people who I hire do not have a social media account  on any platform.
here s my opinion  while I understand thatshe wants a better paycheck for doing the game but I dont like it when they tell their fans to boycott something over something petty and a lie. its up to the person to vote with their wallets  not people like taylor.
tbh I was a little sus about her at the beginning but I just couldn t put my finger on it. I guess I just didn t like how she called out the other actor and was calling for a boycott
the market is imperfect  but it is the best tool we have to determine prices and it takes everything into account. so yeah  emotional manipulation of people on twitter can be a card to play in negotiations. not a very smart card to play  but valid. looks like she is going to lose this hand in the negotiation game.
I said this before but boycotting the game was asking way to much because there where other people that worked on this project and I understood that there are va struggling with in the business because of how badly they are mostly treated but boycotting the project is not the right answer..but now however   Jesus  this shit has hit the fan and the worst part is that the people that are struggling voice actors in their line of work are the ones that will have a harder time  all because of her lies.obviously this is also bad for her because like you said this will potentially have other businesses keep them self far away from her sense she isn t exactly safe.but her actions ultimately will affect other people in her line of work.well on the positive side of things  if y all fans of bayonetta y all should consider buying the game and show your support for the people that did put a lot of work on this project  and also give this liar the middle finger  greed is just the worst thing ever.
she literally denied lying while confirming the media reports were accurate. even if it was a lie by omission itstill doesnt make you look good.
she wants to be paid like she owns part of bayonetta for being hired by the creators owners voice her.  is she a creator of the character
thats nuts thatshe would lie and say I only got paid  4 000 for being the actress in bayonetta is she trying to get the studio to pay her more and using the hashtag believe all women
I didn t think she was that worth in what she ask for  6 figures  shes barely been in anything else in 8 years. jennifer hale is worth it though due to her massive resume and the fact shes one of the most recognisable voice actors in the world.
damn I d talk sexy for 10 grand. Im already british.
at this point Im just going to wait until this gets into a big political fight
so  is she going to start using the  what I said was correct  from a certain point of view  defense
6 35  well  if youre not getting hired anyway and when you do the pay is sht  then what difference does it make
she went the terrence howard route from iron man 1  not a pretty picture when it becomes known that you got greedy.   she basically blew away all the fan support and respect she got over the years by acting like a spoiled brat.   slow clap
damn if thats true she s done lol
honestly is that how little voice actors make though  15 000 for the whole game is painfully low. should be more like 100 000  for the main actor  I think. admittedly  I know nothing about voice acting fees.
they didn t offer her 4k. they are pretty adamant about that fact. I dont know a single gaming company who would offer a semi-professional voice actor 4k  or anyone. 4k breaks down to 133 hours though at  30 an hour  which is the medium rop for voice acting. so they offered to purchase 133 hours  and I would have told them that. its honestly not unbelievable that 133 hours is enough for bayonetta s lines. specially if the voice actor is usually a one-take actor.platinum studios should find better talent. I will be ok if she sounds different.the average rop for voice acting is about 31k a year. entry level is usually around 18.4k  and the highest paid professionals like tom kenny are usually offered 90k. thats salary. when you voice act for a game  they probably only need you for 8 hours a day everyday. think of characters like kratos.you could probably fit everything kratos said onto two or three pages of script throughout the entirety of the 40-hour game. by comparison  atreus would easily push 30 pages of dialogue. Christopher judge was the voice talent  and he made between 1 mil and 5 mil dollars. the catch is  Christopher judge signed a contract. he sold his voice  like an athlete sells their body. you have to have a voice thats desired and marketable first  and you have to impress the right people...thats just life.also  let s be honest and frank about it  bayonetta is not God of war. its got a cult following really. its a decent game  but its devil may cry fem-fatal edition.the voice actors for dmc 5 got paid standard rates  they probably got salary gigs though and not a contract. reason I say this is because dmc5 had a longer production cycle than what bayonetta 3 will have.people like Christopher judge  tom kenny  and daniel southworth are worth their weight in gold. voice actors like liam o brien have a networth in the millions...because all they do is work. they put their ass to the grindstone  and when they get handed a crap deal they either quietly walk away...or decide to do it just because they enjoy what they do  and its not just a career for them.my advice to this sad person  quit your profession and do something else. I dont know anyone who would want to work with you after you put them on blast like that. platinumgames is just trying to do some fan service and revitalize a cult classic...here you are just ready to dawn a coat of victimhood without even considering their position.me @ this  voice actress  cow  you ever think that maybe  just maybe  they dont have a whole lot of cash to work with  you think that if you demand more  they wont have to take it out of some other area of the game  the levels of entitlement are obnoxious  and this is someone who accepted general management for  11 an hour. I know a thing or two about being offered far below what you are worth  you suck it up and prove you are what you say you are worth  or you make exit plans and respectfully and peacefully leave causing the least amount of damage you can on the way out. its called  professionalism .
you got my view for the cute doggo
what s even sadder is that people still continue to harass her everytime she makes a twitter post. its time to move on and let it go. the past is staying in the past. thats it. its over. time to put all that drama away and move on to better things. continuing to harass her is not going to make the situation any better.
I see a lot of comments here of people telling how bayonetta is a great game and such. I remember playing it and I just felt it was  cheap  - no coherent story  the enemy or level designs didn t stood out for me. though graphics and controls weren t bad at the slightest.but those two assets dont make a game great  only okay in my opinion.so can you offer me your reasoning why you think bayonetta is a great game
she needs to re-negotiate her contract if money is the issue. negotiate for a a certain percentage of the overall game sales.
I would love 4k right now lol
her asking for a boycott kinda screws over everyone else who worked on the project  smooth move honey.
by now  we all should have learned not to immediatelly trust allegations of people who get loud in public and wait for judgement until the full story or at least more is out  apparently thats still not the case. the  in this case very fitting  witchhunts keep on going...
I would argue the initial response  from the internet  has the legacy aspect behind it  mel. might be an unpopular opinion  and she s absolutely in the wrong at the end of the day  but I would agree thatshe  is  bayonetta.
they should ve paid her in pesos. 79k doesnt sound too bad
I dont mind people sharing their salaries. I am a manager myself  and my employees often compare their wages. guess what  its a free world. she wants to tell everyone she is being paid shit  and that thus the company is shit  go nuts. lots of companies do lowball employees  and should be laughed at for their incompetence. I dont like the fact she lied about how much money was actually offered though. extremely distasteful. it can be really hard for bad press to go away sometimes. at least her career is probably over.
imagine my shock !  d
a boycott is too much and a perfectly good reason not to support someone by a mistake they made  and calling a boycott is already a huge red flag  but the people really thought they were fighting a good cause and only called it quits because of her completely unrelated beliefs  its absurd.
Im buying. no seconded thoughts about my pre-order. if anything  all this did was make me want to see how jennifer hale does. hellena taylor is an excellent bayonetta no doubt  but no matter how many  years  of whatever she has done  hale has x10 that. also not a fan of sacrificing 10 000 livelihoods for 1 person. thatsounds like something blizzard would do.
youread my mind. great vid!
if actors get royalties from movies  why do voice actors do not get royalties from their acting in video games
oh no! I guess I ll have to go back to not buying it because I didn t want to instead of because the voice actress lady said not to.
did she not know what she was getting paid before the payday     Imean if she agreed to do the work for the pay it isn t insulting.  seems odd she wouldn t know the pay up front.  but also  paying for her training and talent  seems like an odd complaint.
lol I knew something seemed off from her story.
a voice actor is literally the least important person in a video game production.
honestly Im not surprised in the slightest  the whole thing had all kinds of red flags around it especially when she attacked jennifer hale.
4k for how many days  worth if work   five sessions for  4k.   800 per session.  if she s truly the talented professional  she could probably could have gone in and nailed it.  even at 8 hours per session  thats  100 per hour.  where do I sign up
I dont have a reason to trust her anymore  but if what she is saying is true  thatshe tried to get a larger raise  then found out later she d been replaced without being notified  I can kind of understand why she got upset.however.she said no to the offer. I bet she expected them to come back with an even bigger sum  thinking herself irreplaceable  and when they simply hired someone else  this was her reaction. the company has no obligation to continue bribing with her. her bargains didn t get the result she wanted  sucks  but she s got to be an adult and accept thatshe made a bad business deal by turning down the 1500k offer.she tried to hurt the livelihood of the other voice actors  animators  artists  and other employees because she made a mistake. and because she broke the nda no one had any reason to doubt her  because  who would lie about something that will get you blacklisted and sued   thats not ok. buuut  all this publicity might actually end up drawing more people to the game  so it might be positive for the game sales lmao.
well the fucking programmers dont  which as you know are the people who do literally 99  of the work they ve got a set salary and after that they get nothing
@beansoup  yes the list can go on  I was making a single example question sticking to the context of  actors
even if it were all true  would anyone ever hire this woman again after these tweets
ya  I was wondering why these gaming journalists were quick to jump on her lies. if her politics were hard left  I d imagine them going easy on her and say how her poor pay led to her lies or something. my 2 cents.
puppy crashes shot to venerate the laracroft shrine xd
she tried to sabotage the game as payback for them declining to pay her what she wanted and that is low.  its a shame  because she really did great as bayonetta  but knowing thatshe lied only makes me more willing to accept jennifer hale as her replacement.  hale also has a much more impressive career under her belt when it comes to voice acting.
I dont think going to twitter is the problem.  I truly feel the only problem here is her misrepresenting the reality of the situation to rally the community to her agenda of revenge
it makes sense she false even when we didn t got the full pictureva s get payed less in the industry  yes  but telling people to boycott a company will just make other companies to not hirer you. I think she thought she could create enough backlash for the company to hirer her on what she demanded.
the timeline checks out.  she declined to voice the character so they needed to figure out a way around that.  either find someone close enough to her  or change the story to fit a new character.   she said the offer is a buyout and then talks about the profit they make...  when its a buyout  thats it.  you have no rights to any of the property  or any royalties.   now  if she made that kind of deal for the previous games  I see no reason why they wouldn t structure this one similarly.  she wanted more than they were willing to pay  so they offered her 4k to voice what would probably be equivalent to a paragraph or two to write her character out entirely.
wrong think
not really taking helena s side here but even a  15 000 offer seems oddly low to me considering just how successful the franchise is and just how important to thatsuccess the voice acting is. I dont know diddly-squat about the gaming industry but I would have thought she would have been offered at least a six figure salary.
... creatives  have a negotiation problem. like a man-against-man fist fight  the nature of negotiation is adversarial  but both parties usually end up friends when its over.
air mac drops another boom!
forget the topic for a second. I saw a hotdog walk into the room within the first five seconds. good pooch!
who s the more foolish. the fool or the fool who follows him. - ben kenobi.
when you start your video saying how great and talented you are  with how the franchise is successful because of you  than ask people to boycott the game in solidarity for you  this woman may have an ego problem  and yeah thats a red flag. not really sure why people didn t pick up on that when this first broke.
as someone that likes videogames  I feel disappointed. what she s telling people to do is to get a franchise  that is already not really that looked for  to fail. on top of it  bayonetta is a nintendo property. the moment the big n sees bayonetta s sales going down  regardless of the reason  its going to take it out. in other words  she s getting people to kill an already niche franchise. how good!  sarcasm
she is a voice actress..a c level one
the hatred towards joel osteen is actually hilarious because Ive never heard a genuine argument from anyone as to why they hate him and I actually dont care either way.I just enjoy seeing all the outrage over something that most people have never taken the time to look at and even funnier is that the things they do accuse him of there are far worse examples.one that really got me laughing was a post going around fb where someone had snapped a picture of a ferrarI claiming that it was his and everyone went nuts!like  no one questioned whether it was authentic or not. like  just because someone says its his no one questions it which proves my pointif it was his they think he gets paid by the church which he actually doesnt  at least according to him.they dont know the history of the church nor his father who was actually awesome btw and had a lot more solid understanding of the Bible and was a very loving guy and it just oozed out of him and his wife.the whole thing is just a subject that people love to hate him and Ive yet to hear a good reason why and its actually comical at this point and full disclosure..Im not a fan of his teaching.he doesnt feed me. I dont think he has a solid grasp of the Bible and he s done some very dumb things over the years that I didn t like but when Im fair and I step back from the way Imight feel about it there s never a time where I can say he wasn t trying to do a good thing.I just think he genuinely makes dumb mistakes and its funny how everyone is so quick to hate without ever getting the full story just like this girl in the video
already blew my budget on nier  automata beforehand anyway.
Im a Christian too  I felt sad for her but it was obvious for me from the beginning thatshe was being emotional and hence  irrational  and because of that I honestly didn t expect this to become the big drama it became  now her potential politics and beliefs are new information for me  she may have Christian beliefs but lying is not Christian at all.
reminder that our mrs. taylor here posted the video woke twitter cried out feminist twitter then cried sexism  with a lot of bad logic  but Im not the judge of that  the set difference of woke twitter and feminist twitter then said  no  this isn t sexist  this is a general va industry issue  and puts better logical arguments behind why we should stand in solidarity it comes out that mrs. taylor lied all of  logical  twitter looks like a bunch of idiots because they defended and supported her under the reasoning that vas are underpaid when it turns out she turned down one of the best payment plans a va could get. and I laugh at those on  logical  twitter the most.now  I know that vas in general do have a case for being underpaid. but I didn t believe taylor for a second about only being offered  4000. for how lucrative bayonetta has been  nintendo and platinum wouldn t offer so little if they wanted to ensure that the game had the quality fans were expecting. because  y know  they want to sell the game...
hI Christian.
15 grand for a few days work sounds pretty good.
I believed her too if something is unfair its not right   but she twisted the narrative even thatshe got a low ball offer it wasn t as bad as it was  still how she went about itshe cancelled herself. good job greed   common sense.
4 000 is definitely low  this sounds like cap  like ain t no way she s definitely lying
admittedly  I dont care if hellena backed the blue  God bless our troops   follows citizengo  or listens to osteen. personally speaking  I am pissed that I  a nerd and creative that knows the business from a practical view  was lied to about an issue that actually could ve happened.
cant believe people like angry joe rush in to make judgements. joe should know better cuz he got accused before.
I think we need to address the elephant in the room  who is that dog and why aren t they getting airtime
4k or 15k shouldn t matter. she does have one point at least. being paid that little as the voice of the main character in a half a billion dollar franchise is kinda dumb. if that is an industry norm  then I agree it needs to change.
I just saw you on revenge of the cis one of my all time favourite shows. I cant believe you are 35 years old. excuse me if I sound like a simp but you are kind of girl that I need to run into at some point at a bar soon.
what tipped me off thatshe probably wasn t being honest was when she threw out that claim that bayonetta  not counting merch  was a 450 million   franchise. it is not. its a very niche series thatshe  for whatever reason  thinks is way bigger than it is. when you do the math its only made about 180-181 million for both games  and that is if youre selling each copy for  60. so thats being generous even. unfortunately for her  the bloomberg article seemed far more realistic and yeah  we now know she was lying as she confirmed the article s info was true. hope this is a wake up call to people to wait for more info in the future when these things break out  but its the internet so fat chance. hahaha
in the end va s still get paid shitty wages  she went about it the wrong way though.
first she lost a decent voice acting job. then she lost my respect.
I gotta disagree with one point. based off the amount she  claimed  they offered her I can see why you would make a fuss about it. that goes beyond not agreeing on terms. the amount she says she was offered would be an insulting amount for the work and a greedy business practice  something that probably should be exposed...y know...in situation where that actually occurred.
who is voicing in the trailers lol
thats some nice entitlement there.  she failed to procure a contract at the price she wanted and then snubbed the company for not giving in to her demands for her contract.  they made their own counter offer which she rejected.  then she tried to use what ...um...I hate to use the word cloute as she doesnt have any...but she tried to use her cloute to get customers to boycott.  the company didn t flinch.  this person is needing some self awareness and readjustment of their own monetory worth to a business.  its like a line cook for a restaurant demanding a salary and shares in the restaurant and then trying to threaten the restaurant with customer boycotts  claiming those customers will back them cause of their previous line cook work.  someone needs to go work a real job for a while and realize the real world again  dimagine how she would promoted herself by instead of holding out for more for herself  she asked for donations to non profit animal care groups.
actors vastly overestimate their value. blue collar workers are much more important to society and we make breadcrumbs compared to these people who sit in a studio and talk into a microphone for a few hours a day. it would take me the better part of 2 months working my full time back breaking job to make thatsame  lowball   4 000 thatshe claims she was offered.
450 million dollar franchise hooh! thats worth more than tomb raider!
this was just poor execution on her part.  if she would have just made a video that was to the effect of  hey guys I just want you to know I will not be voice acting x because they offered me x.  I did this that and the other thing to get to where I am  I worked hard  I love this franchise and it breaks my heart to say this but....in my opinion  my time is much more valuable that  4k    I think people would have rallied behind that.  true fans would be upset that their beloved character was getting the short end.  edit   oof then the  lies come into play.  this is one of those  yikes  people. walk away  d    4k a session is pretty good money.   oh no they wanted to pay me 20k for 5 days work...the horror of it all     puts on the tesla coil hat  right so 52 weeks with 5 days a week times 4k a day  carry the omg    1 040 000 a year at that rate....  you poor poor soul  lul
you know you screwed up when you get your dram starting talking points from mia kalifa
so these woke people wanted to attack her because of who or what she liked on twitter   thats ridiculous. what matters is if she was offered a fair rate for the amount of work she was expected to do.
believe a word a woman says is like believe a word a politician says.
I strongly disagree. thats way more than the vast majority of people working on the game. revenue is irrelevant. net profits is what matters. hundreds of people work on these games for many years. they all need to be paid. then you add marketing costs and all kinds of other costs. hundreds of millions in expenses. vas are not important  easily replaceable and their work isn t hard. why in the world should they be paid outrageous sums  gamers dont even know them. they dont increase sales. they are not stars  very few exceptions . she was offered 15-20k for 4-5 days of work  4 hours a day . that is nuts. despite bayonetta being far from a half a billion dollar franchise  another lie by her  and being barely profitable  and platinum is even a company in financial troubles. should a a janitor who works for microsoft make millions because the company is worth billions
that was such a massive red flag.
from what I am seeing the 450 million is only gotten by using the sales numbers on vgcats them multiply it by 60.
@flameknightdragon  even going by vg chartz  the highest would be like  187 920 000. still far from the 450 million hellena claimed. when I ran the numbers in the initial estimate  I rounded it off to just the 1.3   the 1.7 million. I didn t add in the 0.09 or the 0.42 million  of steam sales  in there. either way  she s still far off.
lol exactly.
chrissie mayr and mxr plays got bogus strikes in the last few days. check out rekieta law for more info on chrissie and the quartering for mxr.
to be fair  even a  15k flat fee for this work is ridiculously low considering  likely  back-end profits. she s not wrong to call out exploitation  but one person acting alone will not change the situation. that would would require solidarity among all vas  leveraging their collective bargaining power. as itstands  melonie is right she ll have a tough time getting hired after this if companies see her as a troublemaker who isn t worth the aggravation.
gamers are so weird today
it appears thatshe made a material mis-statement about a contract negotiation. and then called for a boycott of the game  based on the mis-statements. the company might well consider this libel  and sue for damage to reputation and brand  while making a knowing untruthful statement. ie malice aforethought. and they would be on reasonable grounds to do so. her arm movements give her away - it is the subconscious expressing the tussle between the words from her mouth and the truth thatshe knows.
its always disappointing to find out that an attractively designed character is voiced by and uggo
Im not boycotting a damn thing
honestly  popular names in any industry should make their financial matters private  not complain online and allow the internet to put pressure on the game company and bully people not even involved in her problems ! there are developers who work their butts off to make the game possible and fun to play  this game is their way of making a living and one woman who was not satisfied with her paycheck and wanting players to boycott a game is not right!glad I waited for the other side of the story to be revealed.
yea I didn t believe she was telling the whole truth right from the start. what she was saying just didn t add up. turns out I was right.
from what I can see now  they both lied. platinum with their usual canned  scheduling conflicts  excuse  and her with stretching the truth  to put it lightly. at this point  we need to see some hard receipts instead of just he said  she said. itsucks thatshe got low-balled by a big company  but not enough reason to cancel my preorder. although I dont doubt for a second how much of greedy scumbags game companies can be  having personally worked first hand in several of them as a cog in the machine  once upon a time.as for the leftists  Im not surprised that they need to vilify her for wrongthink when sensible people need only to look at the facts to make their decision.
to be fair  she s right about some ridiculous salaries and residuals for a-listers.  hundreds of people making barely enough to scrape by on a movie set and 1 or 2 siphoning 30m out of the budget is ridiculous.  but the solution is isn t to pay all actors more its to pay those actors less.
lmfao! I got attacked like mad for not  white knighting  for her and pointing out basic reality. what s his face  the geeks   gamers guy did this scathing video where he  white knighted  for her and attacked the company. he lost mad respect from  me for not thinking first  not doing any research  and let me add not thinking again to the list.
apparently the average rate for a voice actor in the us is  902 for 3 voices over 4 hours or  451 for 1 hr  one character.soooooo yeah.  bayonetta isn t exactly the wordiest of games.
she hasn t worked on another project since dragon age origins on the 360.
4k or 15k is too low for the level of a va star of an ip if it was a hollywood star they would throw millions at them. while throw millions at a faceless va does not make sense something like 60k-150k would have made sense based on the ip s value. sure she hurt her stance with her  miss-telling  of the truth of their offer but both were insulting.
melanie  this was a very poorly researched video. helena taylor said  in her video  that it was a rate for the whole job. if I get paid a  15 rate  at work  what does that mean to you  it obviously means an hourly rate. similarly  a  4k rate for voice acting means that you get  4 000 per session. if you work 3-4 sessions  then you would get  12k to  15k. math  it ain t that hard. next  helena taylor was the star voice actor for that game series. its definitely fair for her to ask for more money as a franchise grows and becomes more profitable. jennifer hale isn t certainly being paid less. she s getting a fat check  because of her storied career and marketability. its funny  because this channel  and others like it  have probably participated in disney  marvel and other boycotts. vote with your dollar. send them a message. dont reward this ideology. but when a worker asks her fans to do the same  you guys poop your britches. everyone can sh t talk their greedy employees and ask their customers to support them. or maybe you guys like unfair treatment  everyone needs to divorce themselves from their political ideologies  left and right . the culture war is incredibly stupid  and so are their soldiers.
if she needs money and voice acting isn t cutting it for her thatsounds like she needs to look at other options.
if children and animals can do your job  you should be grateful you get paid to do it.

just seems like a poorly handled disagreement at the end of the day. surprised its spun out for this long.
even though james gunn was cancelled by conservatives rather than the wokeists  he learned a lesson that other public figures should take to heart and deletes all tweets that are older than 6 months.
four projects per year for that rate isn t though.
companies pay them more because of these peoples names  brands. they increase sales. thats why they are valuable.
@raskolnikov  right.  that makes sense.  especially with half of them insulting half the fan base to the point that it tanks their movies.  great investments!
I dont know if she couldn t get any other roles or just hates working  going by her resume.
hehe little dogo in the back was just chillin
Imean the work to voice should still be paid more than that. thats like a job paid for completion vs hourly thing. games are played and replayed so the work is still valuable. even 15k for a cameo is just trash for a very successful franchise. Imean  character voices matter. if I hear goku with some pip squeak voice going super saiyan as a kid  it just isn t as epic.
well  I thought it was pretty obvious by the get go  while I never heard of her  sorry not sorry  I knew how big of a name is jennifer hale.. so she was expecting me that they didnt offerend more then 4k for her while they hired someone definetelly more expensive then her for the job ! that just doesnt really makes sense..
amazing how many people think they deserve to be paid extra because of what school they went to for training  how much they paid for it or who they were trained by.  doesnt work like that.  you get paid based on what results your employer thinks you can deliver  and how well you do it.
the real question is why are people still preordering any games in 2022  preordering was only necessary when there were a limited amount of physical copies of a game on release. havn t people been burned by preorders enough times to stop doing it
algorithm. plus  I like melmac.
even if it was  4k.. thats  4k for a few hours of work.. its bayonetta.. its not going to be some great epic with award winning dialogue.. she ll have a few hours of lines to go through and be done with it.. I d take 4k for a half day of work...
haha they should get a hold of me I wouldn t mind doing a voice for 4000
a big part of hellena taylor s complaint that I dont like is how she associates her extensive  training  with how much she should be paid  or how much her time and effort is worth. I know not everyone agrees with me  but training should not determine how much you get paid. if you can do a job  then an employer will offer you a wage  hopefully fair  for the work you do. if you cant do a job  you cant do the job.if youre an expert woodworker who can make amazing things  but your employer just wants you to cut some 2x4s  it doesnt make sense to expect to be paid a higher wage than a guy who can just cut 2x4s.not that Im saying voice acting and woodworking are necessarily comparable. one is undeniably more useful that the other. but the analogy still fits.
I hate thatshe lied  but you guys realize how low 15 000 is for a protagonist vo  right  she shouldn t have lied  but I think everyone can agree with walking away from15 000 for a multImillion dollar franchise.
I was offered 4k to do a few hours of work and I feel like I was worth more . well I was actually offered 10k for a few hrs of work and that was offensive I went to x school and here is my degree I am worth far more so I contacted the big pants and then he insulted me more by upping the pay to 15k .
even if the original story of getting paid 4000 kamalas for one job was true  - if I decided to boycott every single videogame or videogame company that done something like this or worse  what would I play  what about saudI arabia beheading journalists and buying nintendo stocks and entire companies like snk  what about the chinese semi-slaves making our consoles  - when comparing her salary to how much money they spent and how much itsells  its a low salary  but when compared to most jobs  its a big salary. - nope  bayonetta is not a big franchise  without the money from nintendo  it could have died with only one game  and platinum is not rich  they could have gone bankrupt. - she is not a big star  someone that will make people buy the game only thanks to her.
so she want 6 figures for a cameo va work.....seems reasonable lmao
but this game will see sales near a billion dollars and people are debating if she should get  4000 or  15000  she wants less than 0.01  of sales for  120- 150 000. thats more than fair since she helped build the franchise. however  boycotting the game is ignorant to others who worked on the game.
my opinion is thatshe got blacklisted for her personal views  by the va mafia that we know exists.she did it wrong   got desperate and posted those videos without spelling all the true imo.idk hale   I found a comment from her saying she is a independent voter but she have sided with leftist politics more then once.take all the fluff out and the most basic facts are usually the true.taylor got called for the job she probably looked at the some console sale numbers on the net and came with a insane counteroffer.pg   most certainly nintendo says   thats a no go   find an option .the va mafia got then hale that took the job no questions asked probably getting a better contract then what taylor got  because taylor counter offer was stupid to begin with.taylor panics and put that video out.
anyone else wondering where the doggo went
your entire argument hangs on the idea thatshe only messaged him on twitter... once.negotiations dont really work that way.her plea for the boycott was deceptive  but only because she had more than enough footage time to explain everything and failed to be forthcoming.
love your cute underarmor   workout gear  my   go to workout stuff to
did she ever consider thatshe may have been mislead about the value of the franchise and that corrupted her perspective on how much it was actually valued  its not that we dont want her to get paid  but this isn t how you negotiate business. she could ve asked for an upfront fee with a small percentage of each copy sold or something like that. playing the victim on social media and dragging the creators that gave you the opportunity isn t the way  when you could ve got an agent to make a deal and meet in the middle. the money was their in many ways. now youre at a complete loss. voice acting is a niche  take it or lose it  kind of business and opportunities like this are what fledgling voice actors want to capitalize on for the convention circuit. free travel  free hotel  free meals  free assistant  autograph meet greets  some with a guaranteed flat rate thats cancels if they exceed the agreed upon amount in autograph sessions . it all adds up to experiences  maybe good or bad  most people would love to have.
she could ve posted the original offer and still gotten sympathy. 10k or even 15k for a signature character like that just instinctively feels like a lowball offer  even if it is industry standard.  gentle reminder here that  200 to 300 years ago  getting  paid  in barely enough food to survive and a few rags a year was a competitive salary for farming work lying through her teeth by making it appear as if the 4k offer for a few lines was the total offer for the entire game was just a really stupid move.I get that itsounds much more outrageous  but you dont lie like that if there s a second party that has the receipts for what actually happened and that has a vested interest in stopping your story.now she looks like a clown.
the game would have to sell more than 16 million copies in order to make a billion dollars.
nonsense. let s see if it will even be profitable.
she was not mislead. she just over hyped it to get pity for herself.
@flameknightdragon  she got the franchise sales total and multiplied by 60x for  60.00 per sale. which isn t accurate due to various price points and discounts over different platforms.
15k for a couple hours work    sounds good to me.
she said their final offer was a flat 4000 and it was indeed their final offer and a flat fee. she just didn t say it was for a cameo and didn t disclose what the initial offers were.
Im impatient  so skip to 7 00 to find out how she lied.
its 2022  almost everyone puts everything on twitter.  its kinda pathetic.  to be honest her initial statement if true of 4000 for the whole game would have been like an insulting offer  offensively so.  so I could understand someone being very upset and suggesting boycotts in a scenario where they were asked to do a job  that they had previously done  for an insultingly low amount of money.  I also understand the no at 15k  that isn t really a lot of money for this kind of role  not a boycott rant.... but a no.however that wasn t what really happened so yeah  this was a pretty big blunder on her part.
I dont know whether or not to buy the game now. on the one hand  this entitled loon makes me want to buy it now. on the other  there s questions as to whether or not bayonetta 3 is toning down the sexy.this assumes it comes out on pc. which is a massive assumption in and of itself.
I have years experience as a narrator for military ceremonies in washington dc  and I dont get but free meal when I do a gig now outside the military.   I probably have more experience and training than her.   voice actors dont make great money. do audio books as they pay a bit for every sale.
this situation only demonstrates the lack of critical thinking of the woke movement
I ended up taking a 2nd job in retail or a gas station when things got financially rough. I didn t go online and raise a stink. mabye she should have taken the check and get a 2nd job instead of making an ass of herself with her bs
and this is why no one should ever believe all women or anyone without full details and context. I suspected she was lying because if she was been such a low amount  it would have been illegal anyway and she broke her terms of contract. she was suspicious from the start!
so she claimed she was offered  4000 to voice the entire game  yet when she turned them down  they went out and hired jennifer hale  one of the best female voice actors in the business. obviously she was lying about what the original offer was.
so  it turned out thatshe s a fraud. no surprise there.
hellena taylor literally lied to her fans. she went from   they offered me  4k    to  they offered me  15k and then  4k to cameo.  why would you not say that at the beginning  also  why wait to break your nda until a week before the game came out  she got caught in one lie and is  most likely  lying now.then we find out thatshe was most likely offered  4k  4 hr session  with a guaranteed 5 sessions  20k. if that is true  I wish I could make  1k hr. but to hear she asked for six figures... if she only asked for  100k  that would be  5k hr! sounds like she may have overestimated her value  would not negotiate  and lost. based on some research I did  sag-aftra appears to say voice acting should be offered about  500 hr for 4 hr sessions for 1 voice or about  950 session  not by hours  for 3 voices. if that is the case  even being offered  4k hr would have been double the industry norm.
I ll voice the game for  4000
your opinion would be fine and dandy if it was her first time around on the game but the fact is thatshe carried the game therefore she should get more as a legacy
are these voice acting people full-time employees  or are they trying to make their cushy occasional side-hustle pay as though its full time. why should they get a  living wage  from a few hours worth of work I keep seeing people say that these people are  terminally underpaid   when in actuality there isn t enough work to warrant full-time employment.and so  unless a voice actor can forge a reputation that allows them to make it full time  they should work another fucking job between gigs.  youre not entitled to a  living wage  just because you like to do a thing.the voice-actor complaint is just a bunch of whiny entitled babies saying   I want my cushy part-time job to pay me as though its full-time.   keep pushing  voice actors  and you ll start to see just how far voice synth tech has come in recent years.
she is so pretty.
4000 for a whole game does seem kinda a low  or am Imisinformed
who accused her of asking for  250 000  its the first time Ive seen that number anywhere. why thatspecific number  was that a freudian slip
two things really bother me on social media.. well many  but- 1  how people will jump on a bandwagon in a comment section  so they can  fit in  with the conversation- and 2  when people dont first look to see if they are understanding the meaning of what s being said  and not just read things  word for word. I could be totally wrong on this  Ive no issue w being wrong- but people of her stature   beliefs  do not go off on social media  because they re just emotional imbeciles. something happened her. she is not responsible for the criminal  woke mob   that likes to flash itself  if there s a cause they believe they can exploit. as a life-long gamer  voices can be extremely important to the success of a game. in face  many times  they are the game. this is just a fact. I dont care if a voa hasn t worked for 30 years- if they were stellar before  still sound relatively the same  and can pull-off the same  feeling  the original character had  they  are worth far more  than a generic voa  who does many projects.all this being said  what I heard her saying  she was offered an amount prior to all of this- 10k being too low she said- this being after the initial amount offered. so she wrote to the creator  and laid her case out to him. he agreed with her  and stated the wanted her to do this. I think some confusion comes in  because the immediate sentence following that  makes itsound like he offered her another 5k  which she then declined. what y all have to remember  is this is twitter. you know  character limits  many times  when people are trying to  squeeze  something in at the end  they cant make a new paragraph  to let everyone know its not a part of the previous sentence. I think the people who d undercut her  offered another 5k  meaning 9k total  to go with a 4k amount  they only offered her  to buy her out. ok  with me  so  this gal was offered a set amount before beginning. thats how things work  this isn t nancy pelosI s bill  where y all have to pass it  to find out what s in it- she was offered an amount up front  to come back and re-voice a character people loved. she agreed. except  somewhere along the line  these numbers began decreasing- or  maybe the guy running the project didn t like something  and decided he didn t really want her in the game. this was when they offered her 4k- to  buy out her contract  or whatever she had- this is what pissed her off. this is what she s saying happened  which makes far more sense  that the other crap we re reading from some of the other stories.I do think she could have done a better job in laying it all out  and  as melonie said  twitters not a good place to do things like this- especially if you have any  conservative  in you. but she must have been getting desperate  had things that needed paying  like we all do  not necessarily in  trouble   but behind  because they were not paying her  what they promised  which she may have then  in turn  promised those she owed  she would pay  when her contract was done. now  this is what I read heard she was saying  trying to take things in from all angles- this being social media  w its limitations. I found this an interesting story  so Im going to do some digging here. if Im mistaken  I ll return and say so. if not  hopefully I can clarify wth s really going on here. but itsure seems to me  there s some kind of a  breech of contract -type thing thats been done  not this gal lying  especially not intentionally  to anyone. I ll do my best  then let people know.
strong lead woman. a key supporting character and fan favorite is black character. yall shouldn t even care about this franchise its not for yall lmao
she said the  4 000 was for  the entire game   which is a blatant lie.
final offer was 4k whats the problem
watch the rest of the video  that figure was a lie
4k was only for a cameo not a whole game. she was offered 15k with is 4 times union rates.
its 4-5 days of work btw for context
l knew somenthing was off l didn t knew if could trust her well my gut feeling was right
Im not saying hellena taylor is in the right here but isn t it too convenient how platinum games replaced a woman with her political spiritual views with a more  current day  radical actress like jennifer hale
that poor dog in the background looked so lonely and bored...
regardless hidekI kamiya is a racist against anyone who doesnt speak japaense and calls us all insects and blocks anyone who doesnt speak japanese so thatshould be the reason people shouldn t buy bayonetta 3! sadly people are too ignorant to not buy it and lets kamiya walk all over them! no other game developer I know does that to fans!
hold on  your hotness.   Im a friendly and youre hot  so not bad vibes meant... youre just wrong on this one. . just because the lady might be a bag of cats it doesnt mean everyone who supported her is wrong.  they just look silly.  I look silly because I think she s absolutely correct.  youre saying in another way that employers can do whatever they want and I call bs on that.  if I have desperate money trouble  youre saying an employer can use my desperation by saying  hey  its less but its still something.  take some or take not at all.  its not the exact situation  but one allows for the other.
helena follows joel osteen . . . . . .. . . . yeah I have questions about that part. . . .
mel  I dont think yourealize how unregulate the gaming industry is. sure she lied about the rate  but even the 15k they did iffer her is not nearly as much as she would be getting for this role if it were tv or radio  in general voice actors in the gaming industry are treated rather poorly
funny thing is  she hasn t done any voice acting  or acting at all  since super smash bros for wiI u and 3ds  that was the last time she voiced bayonetta  and that was on 2015! and she wanted to make itseem she lives of voice acting. well  what the hell was she doing to sustain herselg during all these years  it was weird from the start  and now she has confirmed  that indeed  she was lying.
believe the victim but dont trust their word.ortrust but verify.
even though she was lying
Im shocked  so shocked!.... well not really...
yeah  something sounded off when I first heard it.
agreed  she should negotiate and if she doesnt like the rate then she can say no and move on. Im in it.  if someone offers me less than  120 hr to do a job  I say no and move on.  I have the experience and the talent.  but I am not going to go on social media and bad mouth them and call for a boycott of their business.
gee  your hair looks nice truth anyways  what about  liking cool bands   can I judge people based solely on that   thats ok right  dont scold me
thats one more reason why we cant  believe all women
we see your puppy in the background
dont know the game  dont know the actress  dont know amything about the drama. but looks like Im buying it
15 thousand for 20 hours of work.  750 per hour ain t bad
you have a very nice doggo
I didn t know what you where talking about so I subscribe
oh I get it  I have been in the gaming industry at some capacity for 13 years. dabbled in a little va  minor stuff   was a host for gamestop tv and riot games  many others too   and have done tons of marketing campaigns in general. the gaming industry pays terribly compared to other stuff for sure  and she is in her right to decline and even speak out about how the gaming industry needs to pay better  but to break nda  lie  and call for boycott is just absurd.
in an interview 4 years ago  she said bayonetta 1 lines took 4 days 4 hours a day  if she got paid  4k for that thats  250 hr.  are we really suppose to feel sorry for her   voice acting is a tougher roll since you can be replaced easily by other voice actors.  jennifer hale s resume is far long and probably cost more than hellenas  so its not about the cost.
15k is a damn good offer for voice acting. remember  on the first game in the series  she only had to work for 4 days for about 11 hours of recording. divide 15 by 11   keep in mind the standard pay for a really good va  which she is  is around 300-500 an hour. I dont think I need to tell you  getting paid over 1k an hour for a job is an f in steal!
its a job that literally takes 4-5 days  16-20 hours . she was offered between 15-20k. that is just nuts for a no name va who isn t that great and whose voice isn t even unique. most actors can only dream about that kind of money. va is not a high skill job that only a few people can do. people are replaceable and there are way more vas that job offers. gamers dont even know them. they have 0 star power and sell no games unlike hollywood stars who are worth that much behause the companies value them that high. their name  brand sells products. to compare video game va to successful actors on tv and in big movies just doesnt make any sense.bayonetta is a barely profitable franchise and platinum is not even a big company. her lie about 450 million in revenue is just nuts. she is entitled as hell.
yeah but she lied.
what victim
what lie  the final offer seems to have been 4 000. she is the voice of a multimillion-dollar franchise. pay the woman.
subway is hiring.  winterishere
puppy!  there s a puppy in the background!!!
I wish I knew anything about your subject matter because I enjoy looking at your beautiful face.
please buy bayonetta 3 game is gonna be
she did get caught lackin  in 4k hd 120fps
she s cute  I forgive her.
cute dog spotted
for some reason  I didn t want to jump on the hate wagon on this one. Im glad I didn t.
hey grab that doggo now
look at how she blinks her eyes  believe my lies bat bat of the eyes
mel s like pokimane...only mel s much much nicer
awww the doggo
are you liking chainsaw man
melanie youre so pretty
itsmelt like bs from the beginning when a far more veteraned voice actor accepted the role
new bayonetta. melonie mac.
ahh yes  the age old  women dont get paid enough  card. this isn t the 1960s. things have thankfully changed.
ok lets be honest...we need reference. someone tell me how much these voice actors make tara strongnicole sullivanphil lamarr
doggo in background!
yes I love it!
the initial speculation that was most favorable to her claims was that they were low-balling her to get rid of her so they could get someone else. low-balling happens but then she released other details that made that explanation implausible.
beliveallwomen btw
it just sounds like buyer s remorse. she recorded the lines  or was going to  and as a result she wasn t happy with the agreed non-changeable price. clearly she took the money  but now is regretting the choice thatshe couldn t get more money  how greedy can some people be. at least you could have tried to get a royalty  if youre going to be paid so little  on a game that you know what s going to make millions. but she doesnt seem thatsavvy to me.
im not going to ever understand va 15k to read some lines  of a reaccuring character does seem a but low dont get me wrong but what part of the work did you do going into the game did you write the script did you help animate the the game did you help with coding it no you  go into a box and read lines your contribution shouold be more then that for a reaccuring role but just because its a billion dollor franshise does not mean you going to get anything higher the maybe 100k unless you know you want to start paying them for using her voice or paying them when you go to conventions to sigh merch for the game cause that going to be money in your pocket
victimhood is a power in 2022.
next time let your dog host the show thanks in advance
watching this you can just see this helena lady is bizarre
it doesnt matter how much she claims to have been trained. its speaking for a video game. she s not a celebrity or an established movie actor actress. I literally didn t even know who she was until this video. she should be getting scale and thats it. nothing special. but Im not surprised she lied.
speaking of... and I dont want to spread aspersions about someone  but ... amouranth has continued to upload content. kinda weird given her claims.
man imagine black listing yourself bc you disliked your 15k first offer
she is talking as if her job was the most crucial  what about the programmers  the level designers and animators  to do sooo much more job than her.
sips drink neat
your face as your playing her video about the 4k offer. its like youre watching the video  and every so often you look at the camera as if to say  this woman is nuts right  .
what s bayonetta
people lie every day these days.
I just dont really understand why she would destroy her career by lying like this. it just was so unnecessary
bayonetta this ip is dead to me now because the true bayonetta is dead and viola took her place
didn t know they were working on 3. didn t play 1. didn t play 2. not gonna buy it  but not cause anyone said not to.
why does it have to be like this
I play most my games anime in japanese
videogame voice actors that go woke need to go byebye as theyre being replaced
its not even close to a billion dollar franchise. its a barely profitable franchise. also the pay is for 5 days of work..
@raskolnikov   did I say billion Imeant million my bad
some people get attached to voice actors or narrators but that is far from universal. I do know that the voice actress in mass effect got a lot of attention and has actual fans and I certainly like audiobooks narrated by some voices more than others.
cause the world has a sick disturbing sense of humor.
15k is pretty good.
I ll voice a video game for 15000
helena taylor did more harm for the convo if va are getting paid fairly. love her voice in bayo 1 but the person behind the game is a p.o.s.
another voice actress thatsucks irl  I already learned my lesson with ashley burch  damn that one still hurts
I could understand calling for a boycott if the company was paying significantly below the industry standard  but they offered her way above not only the industry standard but the standard for union workers. when she first came out and said this stuff I was suspicious not because of the boycott thing but because she never mentioned the initial offer she got only the  4k offer  and the fact she bashed the other actor for taking the role after she turned it down. she wants to get paid actor money for voice acting  but she only has to do 4 hour sessions at a time  no spending 2 hours in makeup and having to take lunch in costume  no having to spend weeks or months on set in a foreign country  no having to gain or lose weight or spend weeks learning a new language or doing choreography. even tv actors can spend 80 or more hours on set a week. if voice acting was that lucrative  a lot of regular actors with iconic voices would quit doing regular acting because the long hours wouldn t be worth the pay. its true voice actors have to do a lot of auditions which are unpaid but so do other actors.
I believed untilprobably ben guilty
I found it wierd the objection from her happened when the game is to be released and not when the game is developed.. if the contract you have is fudged up  you take it up when it is getting signed.. so she was offered 10000.. complained and got 5000 more to wich she declined.. the game story got revamped and her character only get 4000 amount of spanduli.. maybe she should just have said okay to 15 grand.. how much does she think the programmers make pr hour worked on the game
in this age of entitlement  identity politics is an ouroboros
why she blink so damn much
so you are going to believe jason and the company even though they have not shown any proof of their claim. they have no document proof of what she said  so they cannot say she lied.
what accent is this  its nice.
5 0000 is not 5 thousand nor is it even a correct comma placement xd.   but yeah! she s going to lose work for this.
talking about lyin etta
she career sue is sided eek
turning down 15k to not stay a legend. wow. I cannot even. recession much
soooo ....  she gets 15k  ... for talking   ...  and  she compares herself to a nurse   ...  now  I want to see a nurse that makes 15k just for talking
called it
oh whaaaa.....whaaa.... whaaa.......actually I cant say anything much about it because I dont do the online gaming stuff..except laugh at drama queen actors..
her version of the story was so off from the get-go that I dont get how anybody fell for it.
its called lying by omission.thats what she did  since she refused the offer leading to her being replaced. an of course out of spite sought to sabotage bayonetta 3 sales with controversy.
it looks like those in sag get overpaid if anything.
she lied..and gamers died
bwah ha ha karma annnd the fans won we got jennifer hale!!! fem shep for live
lying by omission and vague wording is still lying
believe all women am I right hahaha   I called this lie from the start. it a good call that melonie didn t buy in the nonsense garbage as well.
Imean  I always turn on japanese dubs if offered anyway. legend of zelda breath of the wild  much better in japanese.

smh
who cares how long she spent learning her trade  accept the job or find another one  simple.
the boycott thing never felt noble to me   just bring it to awareness   get justice why destroy something ppl are involved
4k sounded like a bs offer  itseemed like a lie to me.
of course she lied. whatever fits the narrative   more important than the truth.
I will buy the game because I have been waiting forever for this game  but now I also will be buying it out of total spite for hellena taylor becauseher.
wow youre pretty. best of to your yt career.
I saw her videos its more like 1080p

her voice and performance as bayonetta is what made the game though.... yeah  she lied  but how do we know the other side of the story is true also .... I want to know how much they are paying jennifer hale.... but I bet its way more than 15k...... she voiced bayonetta for 2 games  what do you mean  just move on if you dont like the pay    look what happened with dead rising 4 and not bringing back the original voice of frank west bit them in the ass  and pretty much killed the character  and maybe even a franchise...to be honest  for a 3rd entry  I would say she deserves 6 figures at the least.. she is the main protagonist  and the game is literally called bayonetta..... let s be honest  they most likely didn t pay her because of her political views  and because she is no longer young and attractive....if you follow the game  everyone s main complaint after the reveal was  thats not bayonetta .  .... you are literally siding with the mob  who stopped caring because of her beliefs
love you
3  3  3
so where was the lie  how much was she actually offered
I hate that hellena taylor lied about how much money she was actually offered and played victim but what I hate more was thatshe threw shade at jennifer hale. roles do get re-casted for one reason or another. unless the character is your oc  you dont have the right to say  she has no right to sign autographs for this character.  just to give one example  for the sly cooper games  the character carmelita fox has had a different voice actress all four games. and what does hellena taylor do after she revealed thatshe lied  she tries to throw more shade at jason schreier.
same but then I learned what the standard rate and work day was for a va and was irritated to learn that its a little less than  4k a session  4 hours . pair that where she said somewhere thatshe voiced bayo2 in 4 sessions my mind placed her into the manipulative c    file.
watch the video and you ll get your answer lol
@melonie mac go boom  I did I got halfway through and you weren t going anywhere so I unsubscribe because it was boring as hell and I was getting a headache from you
@melonie mac go boom  I subscribed gave it a couple of days and just not the cerebral flare Im looking for
@melonie mac go boom  she clearly stated in her video that it was an hourly rate. I think you  and several other channels  need to watch that video again and listen for the keyword  rate .
@miller s meat locker  helena taylor was offered a  4 000 rate for 3-4 sessions  which means she would get  12 000 to  16 000 for the whole job. she wanted a six figure deal  where she d get between  25k and  33k per job. jennifer hale is definitely getting paid much more than a  4k rate. thats for sure. helena taylor rightfully asked for more and better compensation  such as residuals   but platinum games wanted a bigger voice acting star  jennifer hale .
@karma queen  thats not much different  16 000 is nothing for the return based on her making the previous 2 games successful. but its ok replace your main character and see how that goes for a franchise
@miller s meat locker  it will go fine. she did not make the character  she vaed her with a generic british accent that just about any other va can pull off.
@flameknightdragon  voice actors have to bring the character to life. the cadence  inflection  tone  style  attitude  etc. helena taylor did all the legwork. also  voice actors have some input into the dialogue. japanese aren t very good at writing british dialogue... since they re japanese. jennifer hale s bayonetta voice isn t as good as taylor s. just like how kieffer sutherland is nowhere near as good as david hayter  playing snake from metal gear.
@miller s meat locker  the franchise is barely profitable. her voice is not really relevant. no one even noticed she was gone outside of the small core fans. no one even know who she is. she wasn t the reason the game was  successful   again it was a failure and no one wanted to fund a sequel until nintendo stepped in . many can do a voice like that. she didn t write the voice lines. bayonetta 1-2 took her 4 days of work  4 hours a day . she said it was easy work.
@raskolnikov  so if Imake  100 million on a project and I pay you 16 grand youre cool with that even though youre the main part of my project  God people must be chomping at the bit to hire you
well..... I guess your message resounds clearly. it also applies to your video. clearly most people commenting here didn t watch her 3 videos  and they were short lol. you are correct on the idea thatshe will be a difficult hire from now on. did she lie  yup  so youre title isn t wrong. but as you demonstrate  context matters. and my guess is she simply misspoke.all bs aside though  even if they had offered 25k  its too low. business is business  sure  but there are such things called  loyalty  and  appreciation . its not like voice actors can work wherever and whenever they want. she has every right to call for a boycott  and I have every right to ignore that. I still preordered the game. I think it will do great. but she was still wronged imo.
4.000 for months or work  are you kidding me! ! what the shit!
japanese  not big on lying.
entitlement
does thatsay Godzilla on your arm
@melonie mac go boom
believe all women.
at least 50k in this economy and the money they will be making its nothing
I knew these were crocodile tears when I saw the video the first time. just seemed very insincere.
15 thousand  4 thousand  its still too low.
Im still not going to buy the game...not because of her  but because I wasn t going to buy it anyway lol
15k is nothing. I feel like unless somebody makes a thumbnail thatsays 15k!  with a sad emojI people wont get it. 15 k is nothing
thats evidence  ...ok.
she keeps harping on   400m franchise  as if that matters at all. because its popular does that mean their janitors make millions a year now  no  they make what janitors make for any other company. what matters to the market is the difficulty and length of the work and how easy it is to find someone else that can do it as well.
not activists  cultists.also I have no idea who the voice actress is  so in my mind bayonetta made her career. but now thatshe is kinda famous to a enough people to inflate her ego she thinks she deserves more money and that her voice is bayonetta. but this is literally the first time even hearing her name after beating both bayonetta 1 and 2. either decline the offer and shut the hell up or take the offer speak your lines then shut up.
my thoughts I dont care about these voice actors.I dont care about these companies.unless the game has fuckery going on inside the actual game then as long as the game is good  I dont give a fuck.
this sucks cause I used to love hellena
replaced!
does no one get thatshe was getting paid 15k for what equates to probably a weeks worth of work. for her to say she is underpaid is dumb and if she couldn t fill her schedule with work then thats on her not the video game company.
a women lying to leverage people against a person or company  because they are spiteful  never happens  this must be wrong.
yes
@melonie mac go boom  respect    thats my favorite character of all time. been a huge Godzilla fan since I was a kid.
the last part if her videos when she starts to say some things from Bible was....weird lol
they can find a better voice on any low rent street corner  anyway.   4000 is overpaying her...
well.....this is awkward.
actors are overpaid  in everything they do. 4 grand was probably over paying for the amount of hours they worked.
tough
thats so disrespectful to all the other people who worked on the game. she accepted this job  she knew what she was going to be paid. she should be lucky she was offered the job rather than whiny about the lack of money.
nooo smh
yeah  let s pretend thatsjw s on twitter have enough financial power to hold a boycott that is even slightly noticeable. lol
the fact that people are complaining about only 4000 dollars a days work is what s wrong with the world. most people on earth dont make that much per week or month. much less if at all
if the only voice she can do is her regular british accent  I see why she is struggling. most voice actors get good at making more than one voice to keep getting new jobs. you wont last long if you are not versatile or at the very least have a really unique voice or prior celeb status. a british accent is pretty replaceable. my guess is the job was coming to an end and she cant find anymore work now. she is looking to cash out before she retires the gig.
I could give a crap what they offered her. she can agree or disagree with the offer. if she doesnt like the pay she doesnt have to do the job. there ya go.
hellena taylor is a great voice actor  but she needs to stay in her lane
bayounutters
4000 just to read some lines into a mic. she s over paid. lol. its not like she programmed the game  she just reads a few lines of dialog. yeah  she s over paid.
can I have ur dog
what s that creature next to you looks kinda scary.you must be very brave.
stand in solidarity  hearing those obnoxiously overused buzzwords should have set everyone s bullshit detectors to high alert.
hey kitty kitty kitty
good luck finding work now  you never bite the hand that feeds. if they offered that low  why did you accept the job
oh boI nintendo is gonna sue her ass into oblivion  if bayonetta 3 doesnt sell well.
what other roles has she been  great  in
how entitled
not going to lie 4k sounds kind of crazy low to me but idk maybe that is a good amount for voicing a game. but to say that I trained with 3 or 4 people and blah blah its like you are just talking anyone can just talk. thats like being mad that you went to school for cooking for 6  years and mad that olive garden is just offering you 16 an hour. but then when you see she was going to get 15k to just talk she shouldn t get any sympathy.
dontcha know
hold on a minute...  youre wrong.  the lady didn t lie... the story evolved.  forgive me  but I dont think you understand.  itsounds to me like a friend to you she lied and thats what you decided to run with.  so since they offered her  15k earlier but changed it to  4k a year later  then she s a liar    what the hell sense does that make
wait women lie for attention ..amouranth  this lady  amber heard..catching on yet
to me this is hysterical. I created  am writing  producing  editing  and promoting a tiny little scI fI dramedy on broadcast tv nationally and I do it all for free as a side project. Im not putting down money  I am as much a capitalist pig as the next person  lol  but oh my God what she s being paid for that work is more than I have paid into a 52 half-hour scripted tv series  plus a one-hour musical holiday special ! Im by no means wealthy  in fact I probably make less money than most of your viewers  but damn  if you dont like the deal dont effing take it. someone else likely will. and if you can hold out and get more money then thats fantastic! there s no such thing as  too much money   well... there is  but thats a whole other discussion... .  awesome show  Im glad I found your feed! love your common-sense and non-histrionic approach to all this.
as someone who knows people that are professional actors I can personally sympathize with her frustration.truth to be told  acting  regardless of your discipline i.e voice  stage  advertisement  tv or feature film is not a good way of making a living unless you know the right people or are top actor.  in fact you would be surprised at how many broadway stage actors have to take on extra jobs just to cover the basics and pay bills. contrary to what we see on tv  this is not a business where everybody is taking home million dollar paychecks let alone living a lavish lifestyle. the term  starving artists   is a real thing and I think people should show some sympathy for what artists like her have to go through.
they should have learned from the covington catholic kid story. gotta wait for the facts
first melonie  has another dog second the actress should not have lied to people or to omitsome information she alone mess up.
why would anyone ever believe an actor telling a sob story
perhaps she should get a real job.
I understand placing value on your talents but this woman is somewhat of a narcissist when she wants everyone to go to war for little ole me because I am such a victim.
not buying game  just because wokied is against boycott
this is not how you get more work.
there are no protections for these kinds of workers especially in gaming  we have to have some recourse or else we lose everything everytime. art studios have gone bankrupt by taking a big brand deal because of the fact that they have to operate on razor thin margins because they have no protections like other industries. it is the olympics or world cup of gaming. look into brazil now with their huge stadium they were assured would bring them out of economic uncertainty and now they are basically in ruin. when you ask for what you deserve  then never get it  15k is even too little. the lie is no bueno  but creatives are screwed every time always.
ay!!!! hellana taylor all the way.  the hell with platinum games nintendo saga my opinion
imagine if ford stopped making a car because the guy who screwed on the tyres said this. yes  ford could afford it. but imagine the thousands of jobs lost because of one person bitching about how they are too good to work.
it is my eye or I actual see 50 thousand
everything I have given to this game and the fans...   let s be real lady. you worked a grand total of maybe 20 hours on this game.  that ain t even a full work week.  you want more than 1000 an hour for part time work. and you have the audacity to boycot developers who work 80 hour weeks for months to produce this   are you outside yo damn mind
buy game review it then shit about it the rule of nature also I like you tattoo
haha yeah  my parents are staying with me while they move out here and their dogs are here now too
@melonie mac go boom  how many dogs are over there  is it like 10
@melonie mac go boom  those dogs are cool
Ive seen people say the company didn t think she was worth more cause she hasn t voice acted in anything else which would mean she s didn t build up a bigger portfolio to get more money
did she call for boycotts when david hayter got replaced in metal gear  or michael ironside on splinter cell or peter cullen on transformers  nope because it was not her money  that is all she is mad about. and she got replaced by jennifer hale the one of if not the best female voice actress of the generation so there are plenty more people more talented and trained than you waiting tables  I am sure they can get you a application.
she fails to understand a lot. first of all  your degree is worthless. second of all this is incredibly unprofessional they offered you an amount you didnt like it  you declined  end of story. calling for a boycott is ludicrous. lastly they didnt have to even offer to let youreprise the role at all.
traveling nurses make fuck loads of money. working 3 12 hour shifts a week. its insane what they can make. like  10k wk.
that va is actually super woke  shes probably mad just because bayonetta looks like a woman
as a Christian  Im not a fan of joel olsteen either  but there s nothing objectively wrong with that tweet. literally just telling people to do something good to improve their community. wtf.
another case of  believe all women .
its like how you tryina paint a pictuure of the game studio low balling you when the game studio hired a way more famous more high profile voice actress lol foh.
wow talk about priveleged
so you want me to believe a western person who as I know most of them are layers and attention seekers  nope  I dont like the game anyway but I cant trust her either.
15 000 isn t even 1  of what the games have made  even if it was a cameo for  4 000 thats still not enough money for a few lines.she also didn t lie  youre just jumping back and forth trying to make itseem that way.
she never said she asked for 4 grand. she asked for more and they verbally came back at her with that figure. probably it was sarcasm. either way bayonetta is a weaksauce ninja gaiden gow clone with psuedo Christian symbology done by heathens. I ll just wait till its free with playstation plus 6 months from now.
hmm...things to worry about...possible war with russiainflation midterms and here I am wondering how I ended up watching 11 mins of this ... hmm...
too bad  va salary isn t worth the artists  the coders  programmers etc.but Im a fan of games that I play  not talk or watch. see metroid dread.
bye bye career!
I dont care if its a trillion dollar franchise. speaking a few words into a mic for a couple of hours is not worth even one grand. hire anyone off the street to do that.
big mom
cute tattoos babe.
boycott bayonetta 3!
this whole story is so annoying. she is saying she deserves way more money for a week s worth of recording verses the developers who have put in years of work  Im sorry but that makes you a horrible person. 15 grand is pretty generous for the amount of work being asked of her. the ones developing deserve more girl  they have put in way more hours and deserve more credit than you.
jussie smollett anyone
yourealize expecting 1  of the game s profit is completely ridiculous for a game made by hundreds of people  4000 for 1 hour of recording not enough money lying by omission is still a lie. why did she not bring up 15k in the first place  even you think 15k is low.
lol
now they say black people dont influence the culture   hahahaahha look at monique jr.  hahahahahhaha
she s most likely black listed herself by lying intentionally stirring up drama and calling for a boycott to hurt the sales of the game what a foolish way to destroy one s career.
so helena believes in female sex based rights  and police oh well. I dont like her because she lied politics aside idc but her career is done
didn t we learn after the whole pro jared thing to not just  listen and believe  women anymore
nobody gives a shit about your training they care about your product.  you pay for training.  we pay for product.
she torched any future career opportunities while lying about it. total chump behavior. pea-brain drama  all for nothing.
devil may cry has always been better anyway
they took away a bunch of the sexy stuff too. I have no problem not even touching this game.
further proof that feminism is cancer.Imight buy this game just because of her  boycott plea   and I haven t played either b1 or b2 before.
12 min. video to say basically nothing little.
these people boycot and protest  but they dont have to take the jobs. they can change jobs or not do them. they agree to the conditions and then demand more. if you didn t like it  dont take it and move on.
yeah she lied about what was offered her.but even the truth is pretty bad.I believe it wasn t  4 000.00 total.I think it was  4 000.00 per day or something still compared to the  450 000.00 or more they ll make from the game its kind of shitty.by asking for a boycott was all on her.thats her own decision.not our place to judge whether its right or wrong.at least not as Christians.right melonie
soooo many people white knighted and we re screaming support the poor female victim too
believe all women  metoo
madame  the problem is that you are a voice actress. no offense  but the reality is that voice actors are pretty low on the acting totem pole. you want more  go make it on broadway or get roles in tv or film  and you can command more money.
7 days til  halloween
did this woman do the work before they offered to pay her   I dont understand.  its capitalism. is she asking people not to buy a game thatshe isn t even in
jason schreier is also no saint. he doesnt know a damn thing about gaming
zero skin in this game as I have no idea about th bayonetta games but she sounds like shes a conservative....oh oh cant have conservatives doing anything can we. thanks wokiesand yeah the joel osteen does send crawlies down my spine
shes a
how feminism related to someone just choosing to lie to people for sympathy or money related to their job
@yu lee  feminism has been encouraging this type of thing for several years  a few decades  even.
its not always thatsimple.
I dont like him but he s a va ubersimp so him coming out against her says it all. he has seen the documents.
lots of white knights.
oh Lord she lie play bayonetta 3 and new game bayonetta 3. actress voice  I know ... play game suck dude
if she was in support of black lives matter  had pronouns in her bio  and supported the new atheists  I d buy 100 copies.
melanie.  its disappointing you dont know the best use for your mouth.
who cares.its a bayonetta game.
wasting my time  typical youtubers.
I feel bad you had to be around that mersh character eww cringe alert
as a professional you put crap online. I now do not care about your opinion. I default to the company being correct.
the game is still woke globohomo trash though.
how is paying an established professional mere 250k for a project  that brings you multimillions even an issue
thats a sexism I believe
the first two aren t imo
how is not an issue  the janitor who is working at the company is an established professional as well. why should he get less than her  she is replaceable and irrelevant. no one cared she declined the role until she lied shortly before the games release. now she is ab established professional who made the character  wtf. also bayonetta is a barely profitable franchise. she was offered 15-20k for 4-5 days of work.
