i was in the er with my grown daughter who had sepsis secondary to rotting wounds from getting the  you know what  in 2021 just to travel. our largest hospital er nurses kept triaging around her for over 4 hours. even after i called the housing nurse supervisor and bringing this to the er nurses attention several times  they still left her in the waiting room deteriorating in her condition. i loaded her back in my car and took her to our second largest hospital and they triaged her right away  admitted her for 6 weeks on 3-iv antibiotics. unfortunately  she lost a toe and had 4 surgeries with skin grafts to her left hand and has multiple scars and 9 current wounds still healing. i m a nurse myself and pn is absolutely correct about our current healthcare system! it makes me ashamed to be in this industry right now!
i ve said this over and over  i took my hubby to the local hospital experiencing extreme pain and numbness in his upper body.  no feelings in his hands and arms up tothe elbow  it was going on for weeks and getting worse every day  he thought he was going to die..   12 000 in tests later they diagnosed carpal tunnel  they wrapped hishands in braces.  we left in disgust   went online to research  we discovered the problem   he was suffering from a relapse of lyme disease   and yes  he had been bitten by a tick.  the staff never asked him questions  they wouldn t even look him in the eye.  we researched again for a treatment.  his cure was 3000 mg of cbd  no thc .  within a half hour of taking the first dose  he began to feel better and withing two weeks he was back to normal.  don t go to the hospital unless you re bleeding out your eyes or  you havea compound fracture.  anything else don t risk the chance of being killed or being misdiagnosed by quacks who couldn t care less about you.
anyone who has spent time with a friend or family member in a hospital knows this is 100  accurate. it s been happening  to some extent  for 10-15 years  but today it s truly frightening. you cannot leave anyone in the hospital alone  especially anyone who s young  elderly or severely compromised. without a bold and knowledgeable advocate  they re in danger. sad  but very true.
my mom is an rn she left conventional nursing over a decade ago because of these issues. she was targeted as a whistle-blower. she keeps her license up to date and treats people privately. she stays up to date on all the latest research. spending hours in conferences with doctors  nurses and healers. she tracks down remedies and makes sure to source her treatments from the highest quality manufacturers. she was one of the first to treat people for morgellons when everyone else was lying to patients and telling them they were psychotic. she really cares and will even pay out of her own pocket if someone can t afford treatment. she s a real nurse who really cares!
i m a 22yr experienced bsn critical care rn. i walked away from my hospital career on 10-1-21 when the covid vaccine became mandatory. i worked covid and saw the evil and mismanagement for myself and refused to be part of any of it. once people like me see the medical system for what it really is you can t go back.  i m now studying to become an herbalist naturopathic rn. it s time to use my skills in another way. sad but true.  mother nature has cures in our own back yard.
my sister was murdered in the hospital this year on august 5th.  even though we stayed with her around the clock and threatened lawsuits  they didn t care.  my sister had been cared for by hcmc for her whole life and treated well by her renal team until now.  she had gotten a kidney transplant many years ago and lost it after needing blood transfusions when she had ards 4 times from 2014-2016.  always really good care.  well  not anymore.  after covid  she was taken off the kidney transplant list for refusing to get jabbed.  she was on home dialysis for several years and then back on regular dialysis for over a year.  she got lyme s disease and was in the hospital and they didn t know what was happening until one smart doctor asked if they had run a tick panel.  she lived in the middle of the woods in wisconsin they drew blood for it and discharged her. it came back positive. they called in meds but they hadn t addressed why she couldn t eat more than two bites of food per meal.  she ended up back in and she still couldn t eat.  they were going to discharge her again and we had been begging them for a nasogastric tube because she was getting so weak.  they kept refusing and wouldn t give her any nutrition by any other means.  she didn t  want  to have one  but she begged them for one and i threatened malpractice.  they attempted one with zero sedation  and  of course  it didn t go in.  they released her the next day to a nursing home because she ate 4 bites of food and they told her she was now well.  she further deteriorated in the nursing home unable to eat.  nursing home did nothing until she was so weak she was sent back to the hospital.  now she had ards again from no nutrition and weakness.  she was convinced she would live because she had before so many times and had been on a ventilator for 45 days.  they still refused to put in a nasogastric tube.  we finally got one doctor who had seen her years earlier to start iv nutrition.  wth    why not do that nearly a month earlier   the next day she ended up in icu and had to be put on a ventilator.  she was okay with that because she was so weak  she knew her body didn t have the strength to keep breathing on her own and they would put in a nasogastric tube while on the vent.   they did both  but the next morning when i went to eat breakfast in the cafeteria  they removed the tube and put her on hi flow oxygen.  they were sneaky and waited until i was gone.  i got back to the room and asked her wtf had happened. she said they were trying to kill her and screamed that they were f ckers trying to kill her.  she couldn t breathe because she was so weak from no nutrition for a month.  they said her oxygen numbers were fine and i said that s not the problem. she s too weak to keep breathing on her own because you didn t feed her for a month.  they put her on bipap. the next morning  when i went to breakfast  they took her off bipap and back on hi flow oxygen.  i told them if they didn t put her back on hi flow so she could sleep and try to rest  that the room would be filled with attorneys and if they removed that mask they would all be sued.  they left it on.  the next thing that happened was she went into cardiac arrest and they put her back on the ventilator.  it was the last thing they did.  her blood pressure wouldn t stay stable and she ended up dying.  her husband was in the hospital at the same time and heard the code blue from his room and could only sit and cry hoping she would live. they forced the jab on him and he ended up with thrombocytopenia from that and eventually dying from his interstitial lung disease. he had lost his wife of 50 years  but he fought hard to stay alive.  he just didn t have what it took.  he originally went in with shingles when my sister was in with lyme s disease.  the nurses and doctors were not caring  they were okay with not feeding her or feeling threatened by my words.  they would leave her cold and in the fetal position with no blankets. they simply did not give a shit about her or her husband. she was 67 and he was 66.  time for them to go  in their opinion. especially  since they refused the jab.  my brother in law was forced to get jabbed to even start a conversation about a lung transplant. i m saying just to talk about the subject  not to receive one.  so he did it because at that point my sister was still alive and he wanted to be able to stay with her.  that s not everything  but it s most of it in a nutshell.  my parents started the kidney foundation of the upper midwest before i was born.  we knew everyone there at hcmc and it was a great hospital. it s now a killing machine.  no empathy and zero fear of consequences for their actions or inaction.  when i got covid  and i have terrible lung disease  i knew i couldn t go to the hospital because they d kill me.  i ve never been so sick in my life and i knew it was a bio weapon. after 15 days of thinking i d die  i contacted america s frontline doctors and got i ver mectin. i received it 5 days later.  after starting it  by the next day  i knew i wasn t going to die and after 5 days i was over the worst of it. it gave me a heart arrhythmia so i stayed on it to treat my long covid.  i wasn t setting foot in any hospital.  oh  and what finally took out my brother in law  well he had pneumonia while in the hospital but got over that. he ended up dying of covid even though he had been jabbed.  so much for safe and effective. dirty bastards ended up with a big payday by being able to claim his death as covid instead of interstitial lung disease and a broken heart.
the only thing i ever wanted to be was a nurse. i ve been and rn for 42 years. the decline is real. the medical care has declined. the actual caring has dropped dramatically. now there is a man made shortage. i am still a nurse because my exemption was approved. i have personally experienced the lack of caring and follow thru. if you have vulnerable family  do not leave them alone in the hospital.
i retired from being a pharmacist at 48yo because healthcare erased my identity as a compassionate and truthful human. i was reduced to a salesman. i m regaining my humanity day by day.
been an rn for 25 years at our    285 bed local hospital. was able to get a religious exemption to continue working without the jab. i thought i was lucky to keep my job. not so sure now. to say healthcare has changed is an understatement. i feel like everything goes against the basics i was taught. came home in tears yesterday. the workload is double with half the help. not sure how much longer i can do it. my coworkers feel the same. we are in such trouble and the public has no idea.
at 71  i am fortunately in good health. i am on no prescriptions  which always seems to surprise people. through all of covid i didn t wear a mask  that cost me a job of 15 years   didn t social distance  and certainly didn t take the jab  any of them. i got wise decades ago when i saw how hard the government was pushing flu shots. i was taking vitamin d3  c  e  and zinc long before covid came on the scene  so my immune system is in good shape. on the other hand  my oldest niece  who was an icu nurse at one of the largest hospitals in the twin cities  was coerced into taking the first jab under threat of her job. she got so sick and had such an adverse reaction that it was decided she wouldn t have to take any further jabs. then  the hospital changed its mind and told her she d have to get the subsequent shots or lose her job. her husband  also a nurse at the same hospital  had already quit when he received his ultimatum  and since she owns a condo in florida  which she had prior to her marriage  they sold their house in minnesota and moved to a relatively free state. it didn t take long at all for them to find jobs in florida  given the nursing shortage  and from all the research i ve done  if you got the first jab  but no more  your system has a good chance of recovering  so i m hopeful for her. unfortunately  i can t say the same thing for some other family members and friends  who either believed what they were told  or succumbed to the coercive pressure. i am concerned for them  including my youngest sister who had covid and still got the shots  a total of four  now  she also works in the healthcare industry   even though she has ms. i now don t trust the healthcare system at all  and i especially don t want anyone getting anywhere near me with a needle. i hope my health continues to be good  because i know i can t go to the hospital if i ever get sick. hospitals have become like death camps. i had a good friend who got covid and was murdered because he was  treated  with the fauci protocol. so  i m staying as far from hospitals as i can. i m also fortunate in that my doctor is scott jensen  who has been aware of all that has been going on  since the beginning. my hope is that the people responsible are eventually held accountable for their crimes against humanity.
this applies to dental care as well.  my son had a tooth abscess in september.  his dentist could not get him into the oral surgeon until the first of november  so he had to stay on antibiotics for 6 weeks.  the oral surgeon scheduled the removal of his abscess tooth for january 31st.  he was given 6 refills on an antibiotic.  the tooth will be removed in another month.  having to go 5 months for the removal of a toxic tooth is inhumane.
i lost faith in the medical system seven years ago when my youngest daughter had an awful vaccine reaction at just one year old. the doctor and nurses tried to make it seem as though this was caused by anything but the vaccine  but it was obvious to me what happened to her  especially since she was perfectly healthy before receiving those jabs. at the next visit when i declined all vaccinations for both of my children i was made to feel like i was a terrible mother who was willingly putting my kids in harm s way. i stopped taking them to the doctor after that and i dare to say they have been much healthier for it. i started researching for myself instead of blindly trusting  the experts  and i was appalled at what i found. the agenda becomes very clear when you start following the money as they say.
i m a bsn rn.  retired.  the system now goes against everything i was taught.  saddens me.  patriot nurse speaks the truth.
you are so correct! i presented in er with severe pain at my right kidney.   was admitted  and they knew the diagnosis  focused frantically on getting the iv started  ignoring my pain  veins kept blowing. they ignored me  wouldn t answer call light. this was 2021. then the floor nurses were worse! they moved around like zombies  devoid of any point of care or empathy! i finally lost it and called them out on it! embarrassed after finding out of my nursing education background and knowledge  they tried quickly to backpeddle with excuses! i was done  got a script for pain meds and i was gone. i saw so much more!   it s beyond words to describe it. it s like we re living in an evil dimension now!   it s insane! it was worse than a tragedy again  to watch what happened to probably a majority of exceptional healthcare workers. it s so insidious it s almost as if they wanted to get rid of them  and if that s true  then they really don t care about our health anymore   at all!
this has been actually happening for quite a while in my experience in er s.  way before covid.  let me put it this way  you never want to end up in a hospital for any reason.
before my precious wife passed away 4 1 2 yrs. ago  she was in and out of the hospital with chronic pneumonia.  when the obamacare bill was passed and implemented  you could see a definite negative change in the way hospitals and nurses took care of patients.  you really had to look close at what was being administered and the dosage.  i know that since covid  it s even worse according to people i know who have been patients in hospitals.  no one needs to leave a family member or friend alone in a hospital setting for any reason.  they will kill them to get them out of the way.  i know that s harsh  but i ve seen it with my own eyes.  once a chronically ill person has  cost  the system too much they will suddenly pass away for a weird reason.  watch your families and friends if they have to be admitted.
thanks patriot nurse  i needed to hear that. i struggle with this topic every day.  the aging population is going to have healthcare rationed and i know why.  i m in my 60ies  very healthy  but the family is not. they loved to party but the years of booze have wore them out.  booze was cool  hip and fun when the family was younger but now at retirement age  joints are gone and a flight of stairs is next to impossible. i  however  took care of myself and still jog so guess who they call when they need something.i love to help but i need to take care of myself and live life too.  i ration my time  i have too.the healthcare system has finite resources and busted down self abusers have infinite needs.  rationing is not going to go well with this group.
i am hearing horror stories from friends who have gone to the er or have family members who have had to go to er.  they are getting literally zero care.  some are being sent home with no treatment at all and they are severely sick.  it s really horrible in the medical facilities right now.
you are spot on with what you are saying  i saw this first hand as a cancer patient. when i decided to not do the recommended chemotherapy  i was sent to talk with a  counselor   down the hall who tried to put fear into me and ask me if i wanted to just receive  palliative   care! this was from a 1mm breast tumor which was removed!   i chose at that point to stand up and be my own advocate in healthcare. i actually worked in that organization too and they were appalled every time i refused a recommendation. i am now at the 5 year mark since cancer. i retired from healthcare prematurely when i was told to take the jab or be terminated. i am in charge of my own body and what happens to it is between me and my god. no one else!
i am scared to go to the hospital. this should be a sign to all of us that we need to take care of our health to the best of our ability and pray that we don t end up in the hospital for any reason.
that was agonizing to read.  thank you for sharing your story.
truly sorry to hear this. i m actually unemployed nurse working jobs outside of the hospital. very frustrated with the entire mess. outrageous foreign co workers. bizarre work situations   of course out of normal demands on personal time   total lack of respect from superiors for the nursing profession.
@thepatriotnurse  i ve been a nurse for over 35 years.  lost my two jobs as a home infusion nurse because i would not get vaccinated.  luckily i was able to apply for social security  early less money .  no regrets here however ..at least i don t have cells in my body producing and cranking out spike proteins into perpetuity  so it s a win for me!  i ve been a patient a few times since and the care is atrocious.  when you re a nurse or other healthcare professional  it can be really scary going to the er or hospital   we know what good and bad care looks like.  thanks for all your wisdom pn
i quit nursing two augusts ago. couldn t be around those degenerates anymore.
but they can treat 5million new illegals and you as a citizen can pay for it.
@sophie snuffy  i m a little curious about your post.  you said you refused levaquin but then took cipro  i was under the impression that both were fluoroquinolones and carried the same risks side effects.  i have two relatives that had achilles ruptures after taking these drugs  one took cipro  the other took levaquin.  so  now you have me curious if there is a difference in the safety profile of one over the other and if there is  what it is.. i m asking because if i ever had something where i really needed this type of heavy hitter antibiotic  and  one is safer over the other   i d prefer to opt for that  but i m just a little confused because i thought that they pretty much carried  the same risks.  if you could elaborate as to the reasons you were more comfortable with one over the other i d be interested in knowing what the differences are and why you picked one over the other.
i watched an old lady in a wheelchair in the er the other day... she slumped more and more and her adult daughter kept saying  momma look at me  can you look at me !  !   this went on for hrs. the whole waiting room went to the desk and tell them to check her ox  she cough and slump over and over... they finally checked her ox and ran her back... wtf
@thomas voloshen
@sophie snuffy  but-how does a person who doesn t have your knowledge know a dr is right or wrong!! !
what brand cbd did you purchase
someone on here mentioned an accident with multiple fractures  he left with tylenol
@miki miki  my sister broke her arm twice   because of her past addictions  which she has been sober from for about 8 or 9 years  all they would give her was tylenol for the pain from fractures. not to mention so many doctors are now paranoid of the ol   great  opioid crisis     are threatened w  being suspended by higher ups  that they blatantly leave too many patients in agonizing pain  which is criminal   against their oath. since their opioid crisis paranoia has caused their fears of addiction    od deaths   more patients are literally dying from suicides because of their uncontrolled  agonizing pain. it s horrible   overlooked.
that s an awesome story! thanks for sharing! my fav way to get terpenes is through diet  as a nutritionist . eating a whole orange  lemon  or lime is the best medicine there is!  eating the peel is key  pine oil and eucalyptus are huge too. spices are excellent too! quinine supp too!
it has been going on in los angelos county for nearly 25 years. the decline in care there was very obvious. i nearly lost my life due to iatrogenic causes. still suffering health wise from doctor care.
@be bop  one set of stats i read 20 years ago stated that in the usa about 250 000 people a year die due to medical mistakes  i think back then this was a very low number  in the classes i taught back then most of the students i had would get a blank look in their eyes until i put it in prospective--  the state i live would be totally depopulated in less than 2 years at that rate. that got their attention! i believe that the true numbers are way higher  then and even worse now.
@eric blair  i read medical error is the  3 killer in the country. i personally know several people misdiagnosed and a few dead via  medical care  in hospital. i myself have had some experiences with sickcare and i m very hesitant now. they took my mother away 2007 at 66  no blood thinner for an older woman with complications  she was ravaged by blood clots everywhere several days after her surgery in hospital. a specialist was necessary  but her surgeon  come to find out wasn t even board certified. my grandparents outlived her by 30 yrs  her siblings by 15-20 plus yrs. watch your back. remember they re not god and its a business  question them. advocate for you and your loved ones because we re just another number  an empty bed for who s up next
@miki miki  sadly we do not have the real facts stats on how many and the types of medical errors  even just in the us  much less world wide. in part many such things go unrecognized or are miss recorded  -- example nurse t. gets an award for  catching     saving  a patient who went into respiratory arrest.... this sounds a fine and good  right  until you dig into the real story...  the nurse was in a hurry as that floor was short handed again  was short of monitoring equipment again .... the patient was in pain from surgery. the nurse breezed in  gave the patient 100mg of demerol iv push  too fast  and was headed out the door when the patient started to say she felt  funny  meaning odd and stopped breathing.  the short of it in plain words....  the nurse directly caused the problem by being in a rush and almost killed the person. however the situation was set up by administration because they did not have enough staff on duty due to the bottom line budgeting ....
we kept a notebook at all times when my mom was in the hospital. we took shifts. you have to.
@eric blair  sad
i totally agree. my mom passed from  breast  ancer in 1999. in her battle  she was in out of the hospital. our family constantly pulled shifts so at least one of us was always present and advocated her wishes. glad we did because 2x they were going to give her the wrong medication. inept doctors and nurses couldn t wrap a simple bandage. once  a main artery busted  she lost a lot of blood. she was so lethargic and pale. i fought  cussed them out  the hospital to give her a much needed blood transfusion. after the blood transfusion  they didn t clean her bloodied body up for 2 days. i cussed them out again and forced them to immediately wash her in front of me. after that  we moved her to a hospital that gave a dam . the other hospital staff was caring and  did a great job in performing their job duties.
they killed my mother off. you re absolutely 110  correct.
@teddy b  horrifying. so sorry for your loss. praying for you now. much love.
absolutely true. i had a family member who was admitted into one of the top hospitals in the uk for a condition that left her unable to eat. despite being extremely malnourished they let her languish in their care for over a week without providing any nourishment whatsoever and only had excuses piled on over more excuses  including being short staffed   for why they had not started treatment. it blew my mind.
would an infusion nurse hypothetically  of course  surmise that the spike protein is making it into immunoglobulin serums
@karen  did you get treated differently for not being  v   we did with our son. thank you for you true story. i m sorry. but glad you didn t comply. praise god.
@sophie snuffy  ahhhh ok i thought you meant you took cipro and got dex drops.. that makes sense now
as someone with a fair amount of experience in healthcare both small and large hospitals i ll tell you this.   large hospitals frequently do not equate to better care.   they see sooo many people that you are just a number.  just another face in a crowd.   the best care i ve seen is the smallest hospitals that have the specialist you need for your issues.  super large hospitals have the unique doctors that know how to treat rare things  but if you go to john s hopkins for stitches  you re going to get a first year med student doing it with no supervision.
@robert hansen  exactly right  less is more .
@d soule   hypothetically  and  alleged  to be in the blood needed for transfusions  as well. pretty scary.
@sophie snuffy  i have family physicians too watch out for me and us  i watched people i knew die before we even knew they were in the hspital.  i got good help and came out fine but i knew they were trying to keep me alive.  have heard similar storys about my hispital since.  also know some top nurses that have gone on the road.  their families help them do it as a team.  so.... what is a person to do without that family med pro s help    i try to help mine stay ahead with smart use of meds too.  payback is good.  family is good too!
@govtom4  locked into standard of care ethics - much like administrators from what was the soviet union!
@good ole arky gal  triaged already!
@robert hansen  about 5 years ago  i was told that a niagara falls hospital had only 2 doctors on duty - which included the er.  they are called hospitallers!
@isaac  less care can actually mean more money!
my brother had sepsis from a booster too. was sent home three times over 9 days from an urgent care. had his shoulders and leg gutted like a fish.
i bask in the lords glory and feel his safety. his house is built on the most beautiful  and strongest rock. my fellow brothers and sisters. please please remember to work hard and find the flock  find that church and help that church. its is our duty as christian. times are getting tough for many.heavenly father  lord show us your will. only your will knows what is right in all things. thank you for jesus christ. lord our father    me  we love and miss you.amen
@christina mersereau  christina i would like to reply to your comment because i completely understand where you are coming from and why what you see is the reality of nursing today.  i wrote a long comment myself about the previous 25 years when i had been employed as an rn prior to my retirement due to very bad arthritis which required several orthopaedic surgeries  and i couldn t stand the pain nor perform my duties which i took very seriously! i want to describe to you just what happened after my final surgery and why now  when i really need a hip replacement   that i am extremely afraid to go into the hospital to have it performed! i had my 4th knee replacement in 5 years and i d had other non orthopaedic surgeries as well during that time. i used to have a very high pain threshold prior to these surgeries which allowed me to have 5 babies without anything but some gas and i d also been involved in some experiments at the hospital i d worked at involving pain tolerance.  but by this point in time i d had it with the pain and i just wanted the procedure over with so i could return home and back to work.  but since my previous procedure and the one i m talking about there had been a large change in the nursing staff and the quality of care had hit an all time low.at the hospital i d had my previous 3 operations at. after my op i was in the theatres recovery suite and i was closely supervised and given pain medication through my iv and even though i had been taking a lot of pain meds at home to allow me to continue to work right up until the operation and to look after my 5 kids. the nurse there knew this  understood this and medicated me appropriately! but when i was  taken to a ward i was initially given a pca or patient controlled analgesia machine to use so that when i needed it i could give myself the analgesia.  my anesthesiologist had written up a higher quantity of narcotics than usual be put into my pca as i would need more. but for some reason the nursing staff didn t do this and decided themselves that they wouldn t provide me with the quantity of fentanyl ordered by my specialist and when i ran out early   which was inevitable as i d literally just had major surgery   they completely ignored my nurse call bell and just left me there in so much pain that i literally couldn t scream abd i was holdingmy breath! . then my dad  praise god  arrived and saw that i was as white as a sheet and i couldn t speak and he could also see that i was in excruciating pain! also my nurse call bell was on and that the alarm was beeping on my pca as it was empty. i never asked him if he d seen nurses sitting down chatting at the desk but whatever he saw there he took one look at me and went and got 2 nurses who were not from australia originally and they deferred to my dad and he watched them look at me and then went to prepare some more pain relief.  i was finally able to speak after i got control of the pain and i explained to my dad what had happened. he was very angry and i eventually managed my pain with a reduced amount of fentanyl  but this experience has caused me to defer my hip replacement because i ended up with ptsd due to this incident and i cannot trust that i would be treated properly and given what pain meds i need. this comment will sound racist but it is a fact that people   mostly women  from african and asian countries do not   as a whole  practise nursing the same as white anglo-saxon nurses because it is considered a high value profession to have gone to university and ended up as an rn and its an attitudinal issue!.  but it is this prejudice about the high status in which they perceive nursing to be that too often  makes them lousy nurses and lacking in compassion for suffering! as an rn i not only gave out medication but i also washed and toileted my patients and wiped their bottoms and turned them frequently when it was required.  but whether it s a cultural thing or just a very bad attitude   the nurses from overseas who came from afrcan and asian nations on working visas do not perform as well as the home grown variety! i have worked with some nurses from all walks of life who have been horrible nurses but unfortunately the majority of these other staff will do the bare minimum only  believing that the other manual labour and duties were beneath them! when i have complained about actions which i believe to be cruel   especially in aged care  i have basically been ignored because  we need the staff  and so patient care was severely compromised. we now have more and more people with cultural differences that aren t good for patient care in what was once the  caring profession   caring less and less and it makes me terrified to submit myself into their  care ! i absolutely believe that more and more nurses are in the job for reasons other than helping people and it s shocking but it will continue and that s a travesty! thanks for reading this and take care christina.
@thepatriotnurse  i m here to tell you i saw the major demise of medical over 22 years ago.  i have a high pain tolerance  i don t go to the doctor unless i need an rx. i have been doing homeopathic   grandmas remedies for many many years.  i have had 4 kids without  a single tylenol.so one morning  5 15   i woke up doubled over in major pain. my husband was out of town and my friend came over to take me to the hospital  carlsbad nm .  i was sent down for ultrasound . 3 times! the 3rd time the tech said  i don t know why they sent you back down  i already told them it s only gas .  this last ultrasound was transvaginal !!!   a total of 6 hours in the er..   the er  temp doc  doctor comes to me and says  you don t need to come here for attention  you just have the flu.    i fought him on that one and demanded to see my doctor.  a nurse comes in with a clip board asking  who is your doctor   i told her again  as i did in the beginning  and she tipped the clip board slightly enough for me to see there was six lined out names in the doctor space!!! they never got it right.    so my doctor  who hardly ever saw me  comes in and says he doesn t think it s my appendix or the flu  he will consult a surgeon and after i get into a room that doc will be in to see me.  i drift in and out of awareness for hours  each time i buzzed the nurses about this other doctor arrival  i would hear i should go to sleep and i would feel better in the morning  again not even a tylenol.  next morning a friend of ours who was in nam as a nurse  came by to see me and freaks out in how i looked! she storms out to the nurse station rips them a new one!  the surgeon comes by about then too.  he says two choices   go home or surgery to find the issue . how soon  i asked  i was ready to be knocked out!!   turns out i had a large ruptured ovarian cyst!!! i had been bleeding internally about 28 hours!!!  so much for the gas a tech thought it was    the nam nurse came by later and told me she saw guys dying in the field that looked better than i did before surgery !!!!   she knew right when she saw me i was bleeding internally!!    to this day i stay as far away from hospitals  take no meds  no health issues.   we all need to be our own advocate!!!
if you are waiting it is due to factors out of the staffs control  such as acuity and bed state. those are management caused issues that are related to under-resourcing. even when we are crashing and burning as patients there are sicker people the nurse has to work through first.
@nicole blackwell  hello nicole and a happy new year ! i m not sure if you were replying to me or someone else but i thought i d just reply with a couple of points anyway.  as an rn of many years  now retired   i can say that there are certainly occasions where a patient might wait because staff are busy with an emergency event like a heart attack or perhaps someone died and staff are attending to the distraught family members. but regardless of whether there is a code occurring and staff are busy it is never good clinical practice to ignore a patient call bell because you could have another emergency on your hands and thus be completely unaware! i could have   if it was to me you were replying   been having a massive bleed  stoke  seizure etc and be dead by the time i was found! having one emergency in a ward doesn t preclude having another one at the same time and people s status can change very quickly! i spent 2 1 2 years working in an emergency department and i know that things can go from zero to 100 in a very short period of time.  ignoring a patient for any reason isn t just bad practice but adds to the increasing rate of patient death and morbidity in a clinical setting. there will always be someone who can see a bell light up  acknowledge that a patient needs something and quickly go to that room to ensure that they are not in immediate need of care such as the examples i used  but can say to the patient   i m terribly sorry but the rn looking after you is very busy and i can t help you either   but i will ensure that she he will attend to you as soon as they can . it only takes less than a minute   you reassure the patient and you acknowledge their need  turn off the call bell and go back to what you were doing  after of course ensuring that you let that patient s nurse know what the call was for! it safeguards everyone!. as for me   well i could barely breath and if i d had a gun handy i would have blown my brains away with it rather than endure another moment of excruciating pain. i know that sometimes nurses get overwhelmed but sometimes they are there just for the paycheck and should be packing shelves and not  caring  for actual human beings! thanks for reading.
praying for your family!!! omgoodness what an ordeal  wow!!!
@nicole blackwell  that wasn t my daughter s triage experience. i m an experienced doctorate level rn myself and these er nurses  on this particular day  were not triaging according to acuity but according to who walked in the door first. they literally were triaging bodily-abled individuals with the sniffles who were utilizing the er as a clinic for their healthcare needs and should have been assessed by a primary care physician or at one of our many local urgent care clinics.
@mustanger65  i m so sorry to hear this about your brother and pray  he is getting better!
@jan patton  its bad. all the experienced nurses are gone. i refused to get or give the covid shot until they fired me. 20 years experience with perfect evals. i am in my mid 40s  every other nurse on my unit was brand new early 20s. they were thrown off orientation early  they can t operate outside of epic protocols. i was spoiled with senior nurses mentoring me back in 1998. they don t have that. i am not dismissing your experience   but you do need to realize that frontline nurses are being set up to fail. administrators are calling the shots. i wasn t even able to stop the high school diploma educated bedboard clerks from slamming my floor with 8 acute admissions in 30 minutes who needed tele  when we   1 had no tele boxes at all because all were in use and  2 we were already at a 10 to 1 ratio. i had 9 patients and was charge.  management tells these clerks who don t understand medical stuff not to listen to the nurse and that it is more important to get people into beds. i couldn t get them moved and was ordered to take tele off of other patients who needed to be monitored to use them for the new admits without talking to the docs..  by administration and bedboard. we were forbidden from calling bedboard again and telling them that what they are doing is dangerous because it   interrupted their workflow . they were sending icu patients to medsurg floors and even the supervisor was not allowed to override them  and they were dispatching patients to floors from the ed with no report. a bad outcome for these patients could easily be blamed on  incompetent nurses . all of the charge nurses   including me  were threatened for saying these things are dangerous. tip of iceberg. no official reports from frontline nurses in regards to these things are being responded too. lots of worse things are happening. like i said  i refused the covid shots till they fired me. done. this shit is not going to get better until people grasp what administration is doing and how it affects overall function.
i m so sorry she lost her toe.  what a terrible experience
@kacee65  i actually developed an ascending aortic aneurysm from cipro. bad stuff!
woe what the heck    wow. glad you were there. glad she is ok now....or going to be.
@thomas voloshen  yes  but is it really treatment    bad care is still bad care no matter who you are.
thank you for sharing that jan
i so agree with you!!! this kind of generalized type of non diagnostic health care is how i wound up getting an mvp repair which left me with a-fib d-block because the revolving door universal style healthcare left me with primary physicians whom are more general practitioner than specialists when it came to thoracic health. there is nothing like having a real doctor whom has spent a lifetime dedicated in true practice. mind you  this is the va.... even here revolving door practice is common. had i known better when young  i would have been more engaged in getting a ppo and doing the research for finding a true general practitioner that is dedicated and understands just what is at hand. government involvement in using government program trained personnel for these jobs is what has dragged down the public and more so the private sector of health. the one size fits all way of doing health has amounted to more problems for not only the people whom seek good healthcare  but a monumental problem for doctors whom practice privately. not all doctors are horrible  and i do agree not all doctors are saints. insurance is a big problem and the healthcare regulators  underwriters and pharma s that push many good doctors aside for general aspect health in selling social medicine. nothing is quality anymore. we are between a rock and a hard place!
@michelle sartori  i was ignored for hours in the ed with what turned out to be sepsis  experiencing absolutely excruciating pain throughout my entire body. it felt like my bones were being snapped in half and that i d been lit on fire. i was written off as being hysterical and drug seeking. i was eventually given a  talking to  by the clearly annoyed nurse who let me know that she would go get the doctor  but i should know that she s currently taking care of an  actually sick  patient. i would never wish that amount of pain on anyone. i was so desperate for relief that i nearly got up out of the bed and banged my head against the wall in an attempt to knock myself unconscious. i know that may sound ridiculous but it was pure agony. i was discharged and sent away with an rx for naproxen... i went to a different hospital later that day and was admitted for sepsis. the original er  who took cultures  never even bothered to call me with the results. this caused lasting damage both physically and emotionally. i still feel ashamed in some ways  even though i didn t do a thing wrong. that s just how i was made to feel  despite being extremely sick.
@thomas voloshen  or are they even bothering with treating and ignoring whether those entering are well or not  i still think it s aggravating  that we as a nation  citizens that are living here  are subject to heavy restrictions and such  but millions may be bringing in things we haven t been exposed to in this country.  people tend to think they are from mexico. not necessarily.  mexico is just a route for many.  we have no idea in some. i expect our system to collapse. you know  even if i love helping people  i couldn t accept multiple strangers into my home. i know what i can afford  what food and medical supplies i have  number of beds i have  etc. our country s leaders seem to think we have plenty. the medicaid and assistance programs will break eventually. medicare will break. what then  the bad thing is because we were deceived  lied to  treated like second class over c  if a true medical emergency happens here people will brush it off. maybe they know this. i know that sounds conspiracy  but that s where they put our minds. you don t know what or who cares  who to believe  etc.
@tdog  to make us believe we are helpless
@percy lee  percy  i am terribly sorry that you had to experience that. sometimes i wonder if emergency departments are staffed by psychopaths  and i m not kidding! i understand how you would end up traumatised and with ptsd from that experience. i have been septic in the past  i believe that it was 1990 and i had recieved an injection in my knee which had caused a fluid build up and my knee was hot and filled with pus and exudate. i was however treated like a human being   not as a malingerer wasting nurses time. i will explain why i made the earlier comment  i worked as a nurse in the ed  which is what we here in australia call the a e. i loved being able to help people but i was told  get this  that i  cared too much to work in the department because once i had provided medical treatment to my patient and especially if they were aged or had come from a care facility   i would get them comfortable and ensure that they had a cup of tea and a sandwich and if i couldn t find any food then i d make a call and get some from another ward. often these people hadn t eaten or drunk anything for up to a day and i considered that  as well as effective pain relief   that i was required as a human being   to provide proper care  but a lot of the lazy ones felt threatened by that unfortunately! i was also unpopular because we had a man in his early 30 s who was known to have a drug problem present for treatment. i was caring for him but the doctor had written him up for morphine only  when there were many other drug types we could have been using as well or instead of. i ended up giving him 90mls of morphine iv within the space of an hour or so  but it wasn t helping.  i had asked the attending dr if we could try something else but he didn t want to.  now that man left the hospital with his problem undiagnosed and he presented the next day at a larger hospital about  an hour away and this was the tertiary teaching hospital for the area health service.  they had the records from his stay the previous day and determined that the man was  drug seeking  and because of that they made him wait for several hours in the a e waiting room and eventually he left after not being seen.  he was found dead the following morning just outside of the hospital grounds! now there was a big hoo haa over his treatment   obviously   and i was called by someone high up in the health service a few days later. i told the truth as i saw it  which was that this man was provided far less than appropriate care because he was perceived   even without having been properly assessed by a physician   to be drug seeking. he was given a large dose of the wrong medication which masked his clinical symptoms and because he was nor being treated at all  except for the morphine   he left  presented the next day somewhere else and wasn t treated properly there either so left again only to walk off the hospital premises to die of whatever ailment caused him to originally seek medical care! i was not popular there i can tell you but i hadn t done anything but speak the truth! i believe that the health service had to pay a lot of money to his nok and management didn t like that.  but i have always tried to do that which is right in the sight of god not man! i wish that your case was unusual   rare even  but some of the worst sob s work in ed s and because they work there their hearts are full of pride! thanks for your reply and for reading this! god bless your day!
so sorry. i was an r n for  40  years.  i  saw the decline coming. i retired in 2012.
when this system comes crumbling down-and it will-current and former nurses will be called upon to act in a greater capacity than before at a more local level.
@michelle sartori  as my family is aging and going into nursing homes  i am seeing this first hand.
@mustanger65  our tree guy died from sepsis use after his jab.  every time i read that some kid died of sepsis this yesr  the doctors blamed on the flu. i can bet money that they also got the jab
@thomas voloshen  paid dearly for insurance and expected equal treatment.  should have just put my monthly premium dollars in the bank like so many do and get away with it while on medicaid. at least you re not paying for the bad treatment. medical insurance is an important benefit from your employer  while others were going to party s or cash under the table  here i played by the rules. plus add some alphabet letters and you re getting expensive treatments.
@barbara lock  plus you have to pay your monthly premiums for inadequate treatment unlike those on free medicaid.
@mustanger65  oh i m so sorry to hear that! u guys w b in my prayers! i have alot of nerve damage in my arms   legs were the nerves just scream at me like some1 is inches from my ear   oh man words cannot express how deep my empathy for u guys  it brought tears to my eyes for u   ur families
@michelle sartori  b

@christy brown  i pity them enormously and i m sorry for them. i believe that the lord would take me home before i get to that degree  and may  god forgive me saying it  but i d rather someone hands me a 44 magnum with a hollow point bullet and a room lined with plastic and leaves me there for a couple of minutes alone rather than send me into one of those places to die daily inside until i finally stop breathing! i wish i could lie to you and say  it s not that bad   but i believe that  it s like all the dogs and cats that get dumped in a shelter and it s survival of the fittest! i wish that i could be more positive but i can t   not honestly when most staff there seem to be  nurse ratchet . i d rather be dead.! sorry but i must be truthful.  is home care an option or anything else  i m not meaning to be so negative but i am being truthful.
the doctors can  suggest   lol  the protocol. in the end i do what my gut tells me  after researching as much as possible if it warrants it . i ve fortunately not had to encounter many medical issues but when i did  i did not blindly follow a doctor s orders.on one such occasion i was put on cipro oral antibiotics for a nasty uti. the leaflet s warning information was enough to steer me clear of it. i was on vacation with family and they thought i was nuts when i said i would not be taking it. my sister-in-law was simply aghast at my decision  poor thing. i proceeded to drink lots of water and some cranberry juice. it took about 4 hours and lots of bathroom trips but i was successful in flushing the bacteria out of me and felt like a million bucks.  i had done this in the past with much less mild bouts and figured it was worth a try . this occurred about 6 years ago and i haven t had an issue since. i ve been much better about being properly hydrated.
listen to what pn is saying. i m a retired rn. the medical system has been going downhill since the 1980 s. the more the government got involved  the more healthcare plummeted. part of my job description was emergency preparedness  starting 30 years ago. i was laughed at then   even after everything we ve been through these past few years  people are still laughingstock up on medical supplies   medications  don t worry about exp dates  meds are good a lot longer than the date on the bottle . learn how to treat yourself   others. learn what meds are forthe majority of people abusing emergency rooms  are not true emergencies. so don t be those people. that s why er s are back logged
@theoldfarmerswife  yep  case in point  veterans administration....
@aunty mar-mar justme  thank you
i m sorry for what your daughter is going through. i pray that she heals soon.
@eric blair  i believe medical intervention is actually recognized as the third leading cause of death
yes  in life   death danger!
thank you for sharing this. we recently moved to wisconsin from phoenix az. corporate medicine was not a huge problem in az because most doctors had their own group practices and were not employed by the very corrupt enormous health care systems. here in wi it s very different. it s communism at its finest. i found 2 good specialists but mist docs are all in on protocol and bullying the patients who want to make their own medical decisions. it s terrifying. i m a retired nurse who also taught for 19 years. i worked in both bedside nursing and education for 34 years. it was my intention to work into my late 70s but not now. our wonderful patriot nurse is spot on with assessment of the situation and her recommendations. take charge of your health. lose weight  get fit and reduce your reliance on the system. build a community of support and advocate for yourself and those in your circle of family and friends. be careful out there.
@michelle sartori  thank you for having a caring heart and following god s way. we need more people like you in this world.
sounds like she was in the hospital long enough to get sepsis
@thepatriotnurse  p n  i had to have screws and plates inserted into my tibia and ankle because i fell and snapped them clean away from one another. they didn t have me scheduled until 17 hrs. later. after surgery they sent me home 2 hrs. later without pain meds because the dr. said i already took a low dosed pain med for my back which is also held together with metal. was i seriously wronged as i feel i was  god bless you.
i am glad you are still a nurse because we need people like you who actually care! all the best and god bless!! prayer sent for your family!!!
@sophie snuffy  i agree!
god bless you and everyone in your sphere
@sophie snuffy  true and i really did not want to make a  racist  comment but to define the differences from a  cultural  standpoint  but unfortunately i couldn t describe what i had seen without adding race to the equation. however it is true that there are bad apples in all groups and angels as well  but some nurses are not suited to the profession regardless of race or ethnicity.  i hope that you have a lovely day! thanks for your reply.
@jim waterhouse  amen brother. america needs jesus christ.
@melanie dileo  amen!
amen
@sophie snuffy  what a nightmare for your sweet boy but i cannot help but think of all the other animals that the chinese vet will  treat  over the course of her career! it made me think of the university hospital that trains veterinary students and i used to have rabbits and they and the guinea pigs and i was very close to them all. pascal was my final rabbit and i can t remember what the problem was but without going over the experience again  i will just say that i felt the very same way about the  treatment  given to the poor creatures! there s a lot of nast  cruel and horrible people in our world today! take care.
@sophie snuffy  you re in montana then   i forgot that you wouldn t know where i was from because i usually write it  but i m in country nsw australia and i watch a channel on youtube which david paulide s operates. he wrote the  missing 411 books and the documentaries as well. he s in montana too and it s one state in the usa which i would have loved to see! you guys are fairly independent  liberty loving montanan s there aren t you  which i admire greatly
we are living  i. 1984 and a clockwork  orange society if you don t know what i am talking about they are movies. they are coming to pass .
@thepatriotnurse   watch the movie 1984 and clockwork orange . this is what is happening in society  today.
my uncle was killed by the healthcare system last year. it started by the ambulance company dropping him giving him a brain bleed. they kept him in the hospital for 9 months causing problem after problem  until he died 5hrs after my dad died unexpectedly  from complications of a colonoscopy where they perforated his colon. my aunt is currently working w a lawyer.
@moonglow630  i m so very sorry to hear about the loss of your dad and uncle. may god surround you and your family with the peace and comfort that he alone can provide
@jan patton  thank you so much
holy cow! so sorry she is going through all of that  that is heartbreaking. if you see or can treat any current infectious wounds  try to do so with manuka honey.  not medical advice  but it has been used to treat mrsa. i ve used it to treat  boils  cysts  infections  unknown  and bumble foot on a chicken  staff .
i m so sorry to hear that about your daughter. that s horrible.  it shouldn t happen in this country but it is.
we the  you know what referring to  the jab  aunt afraid to say it.
@arbonne lady  i had two cysts that had grown tails   were strangling each other. because the pain was on my right side    i was vomiting because it was so bad  so they thought it was my appendix. they waited 3 days before doing an ultrasound. i was left in pain waiting for my white blood count to go up that entire time. i had emergency surgery days later. that cyst pain is no joke. i ve been suffering from chronic pain for 20yrs    i still use that as my  10  on my pain scale.
sad!  i believe it.
i m so sorry that  happened to your daughter.  i avoid any healthcare today  and  being an  rn only  makes me more committed to stay home..
very sorry about your daughter this is what we are dealing with money over people. i cannot see the health care system getting any better god help us.
you get the best care when you are there with a loved one watching and asking questions.
registered nursing in the usa has never had strong state or national leadership to work to keep the integrity and honor of the actual profession strong.   everyone from the lowest rung aide is called a nurse.   rns let the system dilute the importance  the once rigorous education and the actual job of a registered nurse.   the state boards for rns  of my state  tx  are no longer even hard folks.  what can we expect when such basics have been ignored   only thing great about ca nurses was they at least had enough compassion for their patients to stand up to ca lawmakers and make good nurse to patient ratios a law.   so  fellow nurses  these things can be done!!
@arbonne lady  a free for all - of tests  assertions  diagnoses  etc. - with a lot of money changing hands!
@suz h  you raise an excellent point.  if your doctor comes in sporting rainbow colored hair and a pierced nasal septum  that would be a  red flag  in my estimation.....
all these horror stories from the front lines of the medical pharmaceutical corporatocracy empire.  after 27 years i had a few of my own to relate.  i am glad to have broken free of the rockefeller medicine matrix.
@marilyn buchanan  i felt the tremors myself in 2018 and reading the writing on the wall  i got into senior home care which was much better until the covidiocy struck with the masking and demands to be quackzinated.  so i decided to get out whilst the getting was good
@michelle sartori  yes  there should be many at home senior care businesses out there  all over the country.  they can provide lite housekeeping  laundry  cooking  supervision of med taking  toileting   companionship  and shopping  transportation. they also provide 1 on 1 bedside sitting care if desired should the client have to be hospitalized for any reason. of course  proceed with caution  as always.  if i were you i would read reviews by both family members and care workers of any of these businesses in glassdoor or indeed so that you will get a sense of whether or not they provide a good quality of care. then you can interview them in person  with a list of pertinent questions to which they need to provide satisfactory answers.  a good medicare supplement ought to provide financing for this  maybe with a rider specifically for home care attached. long term care insurance should cover this as well.
@catherine hazur  thepatriotnurse revealed a lot more about the finance-driven health care system.  i m looking forward to learning more from her!
sorry   michelle  i answered your question as though you were here in the states  rather than in australia. i have absolutely no idea whatsoever regarding the status of senior at home care there in your country.  i would hope that it is well established.
@catherine hazur  senior care has been trending toward triage!
@steve kaylor  what have you observed so far
@catherine hazur  that s why those in health care  stick to standard of care ethics - which is often not accountable in its real effects!
@catherine hazur  i will certainly look up starfield.  in 2008  i read mary brennan s article in the buffalo news about what was done to her very fit 88-year-old mother  lilly.  she was getting ready to attend her 70th class reunion and was practicing her dancing.  she was injured and sent to the hospital. while there  the staff found a muscle relaxer buried on her prescription list and immediately added it to her cocktail of drugs.  when lilly began her walk rehab  she started becoming dizzy. she continued her unsteady walking - the staff noticed this but took no action to stop this drug.  so  after about 4 days  lilly fell  was badly injured and died about a week later.  this negligence is a very good example of how a doctor and staffers lockstep around standard of care ethics  while ignoring the condition of their patient. it is obvious that their political-financial agenda is all that matters - here they were able generate a financial stream and terminate lilly  without hospice or a lethal injection from canada s maid act.  this kind of ethics has become mainstream  since health care is so financialized - this is entirely immoral and must be reversed!             i gave people photocopies of brennan s article - along with my response.  i postal mailed her this and also other material 4 times.  mary said that she had trusted the system  and then began a speaking tour about medical error - i said that  structured negligence is hardly a happenstance error!    in iceland  a patient must sign his name once and then he gets all he needs to heal-up!
@steve kaylor  i looked up mary brennan  the patient s daughter  on line.  apparently after her mother s death in 2011 she became a strong advocate for patient safety  working in conjunction  with the university at buffalo medical and nursing schools in a volunteer advisory capacity.  she lectured students at both schools regarding  the medical error issue relevant to the broader concern of seeing the patient s humanity  which should be first and foremost.nobody has any business being in a so called healing profession if they regard the patient  primarily as a consumer of experimental procedures  treatments and pharmaceuticals that ai  algorithms  spit out.  but that s what we re getting with current rockefeller medicine modeling protocols that seem to slip further and further away from human biology and into the realm of transhumanism.it doesn t seem as if her ministrations  affected  business as usual  all that much long term  but it may have helped raise the consciousness among intelligent consumers that medical errors had been being accepted as standard protocol.  because the medical pharmaceutical corporatocracy has been up until now one big monolithic whitewashed sepulchre  very  efficacious  in their disguise as an angel of light  holding out implied promises of defending the helpless global population against the corporatocracy s predatory promotion of disease and death.no healing.  there s no money in that   the idea has always been to use side effects  direct effects of their pharmaceutical products and  miracle   treatment modalities to  keep patients in a chronic or subclinical disease state as repeat customers as per the medical business model to fatten its bottom line.  the mother had been on too many meds which led to weakness  instability  compromised immunity and falls which ended in her death and decline.  she had acquired 3 infections to antibiotic resistant bacteria while hospitalized  leading to overwhelming sepsis.  sepsis related to antibiotic resistant infections is fairly common in hospitals.  this is nothing new.  fast forward to 2023 and ub as well as other corporate cartel teaching institutions are awash in indoctrination in wokery and the promotion of  dependence on digital medicine as it departs further and further from human biology and into the realm of experiments in transhumanism. you can see it in their teaching syllabi.  this feels like that jolt of adrenaline  you get during that split second  after that train you ve been riding on has left the tracks and is now plummeting downward in a race with itself to the bottom.  with disaster and demise but a moment away  too late to intervene on the human levelgod s judgement on the whole mess and the western idolization of so called medicine
@catherine hazur  hi catherine  she is mary brennan-taylor and her mother s name was actually alice.  i m just getting started with barbara steinfeld s 1992 primary care principles  1.  first contact care  2.  continuity of care  3.  comprehensive care  4.  coordination of care.  in today s health system in the u.s.  someone gets first contact care and little else - unless financial arrangements are right.  the aca is even worse - it is obstructionist and is triage by accountants!     i will write more later!
@catherine hazur  i m going to be working with your powerful description-indictments!   here are a few of my adaptations    nowadays  the patient s overworked doctor  nurses and other staffers ignore the patient s dignity  and follow rote instructions about care  while hardly visualizing what they are effectively doing.  this must be the case - since e.g.  giving someone 13 pills a day is poisonous to his immunity  liver  heart  digestion  morale  other inner functions and walk therapy.  keeping him in this subclinical disease condition  where he eventually gets mersa  sepsis or other infections must be very demoralizing and unpleasant to the patient - yet serves the purpose of keeping him as a cash cow for maybe 3 months  like my friend phyillis  mother  who died anyway.          quite a bit of this structured negligence is due to the top-to-bottom financialization of health care  and most other things .  furthermore  such financialization is probably issued as derivative trade items on the international marketplace - which has  2 thousand trillion of gambled-up claims and where  5 trillion changes hands every day.   if such financialization is damaging health care and the general welfare of populations - then the u.s.   other nations must impose a 1933 like bankruptcy reorganization  which will freeze   firewall out all speculative claims  while also generating credit for hospitals  more staff and the instituting of holistic medicine for the healing of all patients.  in 1933  the reconstruction finance corporation provided credit for hospitals  the construction of 38 dams in the se and for the build-up of industry - all promoting the general welfare of the people locked-in by the preamble of the constitution!
i learned the hard way   one nurse tried to do me under at a big hospital the other hospital wanted me to sign a do not resuscitate   to talk with the end of life people. i had 60 pounds of fluid on me that was mainly being ignored a lung dr. told me he could drain the fluid off my lungs  they wouldn t let him!   sent me home with still yet 12 pounds of water on me  needless to say i ended up back at the hospital where a kind kidney dr. saw me and followed up with me   my fluid overload each day until i was normal weight again  but while there i was abused both by a different kidney dr. both physically   verbly   a traveling nurse. i am terrified of having to ever go to a hospital ever!
@elsie  at least with the tiergarten 4 program in germany during the 1930s - carefully selected doctors   nurses  handled  certain patents.  now  hospitals here are so finance-driven that almost any staffer will blithely carry out standard of care procedure  while also inveigling hospice .             except for maybe children  hospitals are hardly dedicated to healing - yes  try to handle things yourself!
may god bless your mom  she s a real jewel in these days of greed and selfishness.  thank you  to her.
what s the treatment for morgellons  thank you
@m l  ivermectin  clean diet  a regiment of supplements. takes a long time to heal from it. i can put you in touch with her if you need help
@renalda markos  ... thank you for responding
may god bless her!
lucky  you said no!
my god...this was absolutely heartbreaking!!!!   i am so very sorry!   these people need to be held accountable for this incredible cruelty!!!!
my heart goes out to you i can t believe this is happening in our country! god bless you!
i m so sorry!
i feel sorry for you -- having to go through 4 deaths murders of your closest family members within a short period of time.  anger or rage would be a healthy reaction -- i hope that you are receiving therapy by an empathetic psychologist  not psychiatrist  that you can trust.  if not  then some type of support by like-minded trusted friends.  take care.
im so sorry this is so painful
so sorry for your loss sending prayer s your way. may our heavenly father comfort you   wrap his loving arms around you during this very difficult time in our nation
@steelers girl  praise jesus
i totally understand! my wife died nov 5 2018  and she was lucky!! if she were alive today she would have been forced to get the bs vaccine! i miss her but at least she didn t have to see the rapid decline in our healthcare and our country!
we are dealing with pure evil
with you. my father died in a misnamed  care facility  of starvation. verifoed that when i acced under demand his medical records. best part  i tried to get legal action against the doc to stop him. three attorneys all said it was not worth the time even thoughthey agreed completely. theyy said there was not enough    in it for thwm.
my husband was trained as an md at u of m and hcmc 20  years ago.  we hear horror stories coming out of mn s health care these days.  while no where is very good these days  he is happy to have moved away and practices elsewhere. the quality of graduates is terrible.  i am sorry for your loss...i tell everyone who goes into or has a loved one go into a hospital to never ever leave them there alone  and question everything.
i know someone else who needed a lung transplant and was told they needed the special juice to get a new lung. well they eventually got the call for one. the surgery from my understanding went well but the body rejected it. it may had something to due with the special juice prior to surgery. it s awful what the healthcare is doing
what did they give your brother-in-law  maybe he didn t die of covid  but a drug
i m so sorry! i i survived covi hospital stay but they tried pretty hard to get rid of me.
every american needs to watch d!ed suddenly as soon as possible  god wants you to know what happened
revelation 18 23
i am so sorry. we really need a covid jab support group or a medical abuse support group for people that have been harmed by the medical community during the pamdemic.
i m so sorry  i lost my husband in 2009 because the dr s were sure he just wanted drugs  he ended up having a stroke and died 9-24-09. because they didn t believe him
no more common sense from the medical field. nobody trained properly and no one able to make diagnosis outside of the flowchart. if you don t fit the flowchart then you are out of luck and it does seem like they could care less.
oh my god this was utterly so so so so disturbing to read  i m so sorry to loss of your sister .
personal bedside rental rn is an untapped entrepreneurial activity
thank you for your service!
@c mcb  for those who can afford it.
@c mcb it is but with the cost of healthcare very few can afford to hire an rn privately to monitor their loved one in the hospital  i m an unemployed rn refusing the vaxx and would love to do something like that. i m going to ponder your idea !blessings
were there any special tricks to getting your exemption approved
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  while pondering  i  an unvaccinated unknown to the hospital staff  was allowed to visit my son his wife and my new grand daughter in the hospital with no one asking my vax status here in michigan
@papabird  so sorry for your loss
@papabird  long before covid or leastwise in 2015  we got to take my mother off life support as she went and got a flu vax and pneumonia vax one in each arm  adversely affecting her pradaxa anti-coagulant  resulting in pulmonary demise. her pcp was unaware she went to a pharmacy and obtained both vaccines on the same day  and also when she started to experience respiratory symptoms  she was embarrassed in not consulting her doctor before making vax decisions. afterall vaccines are safe other than a sore arm right
yes absolutely agree!
@papabird  they counted on people being afraid. i have an elderly family that has taken every c jab available. i believe the fact that he takes a prescription blood thinner is the only reason he is still alive. i m so sorry for your loss.
@papabird  i am so sorry. condolences to you and your family.
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  if you are interested in an exemption  contact peggy at the healthy american. she can help.
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  good luck and try assisted living facilities.
@c mcb  i will never take another one. i had a child who s life was destroyed by a mandated childhood jab.
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  don t give a religion! just scripture alone. that s what they will prod for your religion. because pope is head over all religions and he gave the ok for the thing.
@do the hokey pokey and get busy  same brain injury
@rebecca 11 11  thank you ! no pope is over anything for me  my faith rests in jesus christ and him alone !glory to god  the king of kings and ruler of all !
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  i  agree halleluyah!
@papabird sorry for your loss. many seniors are scared. who can blame them with the bombardment of fear they see and hear every day. they are much more trusting of the media  their government and the medical health system. all of these entities really couldn t care less for us.
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  no one said you have to charge outrageous fee s... something is better than nothing as you said  you re unemployed currently.
@c mcb  yeah but most people can t afford that.
sad but true
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  find an empathic physician or np who will find a good reason to write the exemption request for you  i did this for two nurses i worked with at my last gig. both of them were approved.
@hycoperosity  if its medicare or your health plan that s requesting an annual physical that is not something that  an rn can do.
my father had a traumatic brain injury last year. i never left his side  constantly advocating and becoming very stern with the docs and nurses in his care. he would have died had i not dropped everything to fly out of state to oversee every single step. he lives with me now but i always think of the frail elderly who do not have anyone.
@jcgurl  you are smart. my daughter that i mentioned early was hospitalized many many times during her life. she was total care. we did not leave her no matter what unit she was in. keep on being the best advocate for yourself and loved ones. i tell that to my patients every day. you have to be strong and verbal to get what is needed and deserved.
@c mcb  we used to call them private duty nurses.
@do the hokey pokey and get busy  i dropped out of nursing school right before it happened because of the things i saw in clincial. i did not want to be a part of a group of people who were mean spirited  selfish and out for their own. i kept a journal of everything that was done to my dad - med changes  care  doctors rounding  etc. i saw so many things!
i was accepted in boston for lpn program but they required me to take high school algebra prior to registration.  that stopped me at i was scared of algebra and also someone told me a story of corpses sitting up suddenly in the elevator.  i was young.  kind of glad now that i see what happened to the ones refusing the illegal mandate.
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  i hope this works out for you because i am sure that your services would be needed by many.  best of everything to you in achieving this.
@hycoperosity  the problem with a retired rn  i am retired  your license is retired. this means you can no longer practice nursing volunteer or otherwise  you can go-to jail if caught  and you no longer have nursing insurance to cover any malpractice brought against you.
@tjcole  my cousin is now 75 years old.   she s been a nurse since she was about 22 and she still gets her license renewed!
easier said then done. my husband is in the va hospital.....no visitors allowed. so there is no choice. family is at the mercy of getting 2nd hand information from a nurse who typically telling me nothing mire  he s resting  or that i need to ask the dr. some drs don t return calls. very frustrating.
@do the hokey pokey and get busy  stanley plotkin under oath-
i have always made a point of daily visits to hospitalized family. but due to my state s covid restrictions we couldn t visit people who were in the hospital in 2020 and early 2021. in august of 2021 through september of 2022 i couldn t visit them at all because i haven t gotten a jab. i have a family member who declined going to the hospital for further inpatient testing and treatment to preserve kidney function because they couldn t have family present to advocate. since surgery needed to set up dialysis can be done outpatient  they elected to start dialysis a year or two earlier than they would have otherwise needed to do.
when i grew up in the south  nobody was allowed to stay overnight alone. a family member always stayed with them. those days are over.
my hubby is a quadriplegic  when he got covid they wanted to throw me out. i picked him up when he asked and we went for the front doors. we ride together til the wheels fall off and he would rather die in the parking lot with me than have the doc kill him without me....
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  no hospital here would let them in  never gonna happen. here
@marylynn caldwell  not so much looking for a nurse to provide services in a hospital which would be a legal issue  but to stay at bedside and ask questions take notes and make the staff concerned. like they used to notate in hospital paper charts  dating myself  that family rn at bedside  which alerted all hospital personnel to not make mistakes in the family members presence. more of a guardian angel at bedside.
@kathy mc  i m from the hartford ct  and i was allowed to stay overnight with my 89 yr old mother. i had spoken to the supervisor.
nurse of 47 years  totally agree.
@good ole arky gal
thank you!!!
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  my pc doc got his exemption on religious grounds.  he is a fantastic doc and his patients are loyal.  he told me not to get the cov vac.  if the religious exemption had not been accepted  he said he would have quit.
i ve been telling ppl i care about - never ever go to the er or dr appt without someone who cares about you  who has some medical knowledge or good critical thinking and isn t afraid to speak up ask questions and will not leave you by yourself. my son is 40 yrs old had asthma and i ve been saying that for around 36 yrs. even that far back it was scary for the most part. but then again there were those practitioners that shone. i ve never understood why i should just give over the care of my body to someone who literally spends maybe 5 minutes talking and some listening.
@silvershades  make sure the person is your legal health advocate  who accompanies you.  that what me and my sister do  and it is signed and witnessed officially so they can t tell us we can t accompany or know everything about proposed treatment.  --of course  the first part is staying out of the hospital in the first place.
@jcgurl  same here. va nurse told me to get him out of va hosp before they killed him. got power of atty for my then fiance  to advocate for his health while he was hospitalized. good thing  i had him transferred from the va hosp. to a civilan hosp for better care. voided poa once he was able to make his own decisions.
canada here-my mom  recently moved to a care home  was given the flu shot after i repeatedly told them  no shots  and to chart that. they dug up a paper where my father said the flu shot was ok but he had died and i was in charge! so many staff moving through that place! so  mom got all achey and weak  fell and broke her hip and 6 weeks now she s still in a wheelchair and i pray she will walk again soon. my biggest fear is they ll give her  the  other shots  by mistake  at which point i might go postal. i have a plan for big changes but i ll not write it now!
canada here-i no longer trust medical people and it s good to get patriot nurse s confirmation. my mom  recently moved to a care home  was given the flu shot after i repeatedly told them  no shots  and to chart that. they dug up a paper where my father said the flu shot was ok but he had died  oct  and i was in charge and had given them legal protective care documents. there are so many staff moving through that place  they can t keep up with individual protocols or maybe certain ones do as they please. so  mom got all achey and weak from the flu shot  fell and broke her hip and 6 weeks now she s still in a wheelchair and i pray she will walk again soon. my biggest fear is they ll give her  the  other shots  by mistake  at which point i might go postal. i have a plan for big changes to her care but i ll not write it now!
@c mcb  hummmm  interesting thread.....    i have some friends who have unique skills..... they have both a medical background and detective background.  i plan to suggest this to them....     btw i concur never leave family friends alone in the hospitals.....  we never do....  some of the stories i could tell....  the few that i can share are scary enough...   a nurse friend had stayed with her sister 24 7 one week when the sister was a patient...  except the last night with the sister going to be dis charged the next day...  so my friend went home for a shower ect.... when she got back early the next am her sister had partly fallen out of the bed and got hung on the bed railing.... dead and cold. so the sister had been dead for several hours and the staff did not know it. the oncoming staff were still getting report before the shift started.  --- so yes  never leave loved ones alone in a  healthcare  setting!!!   if you can not stay with them  then hire someone to sit with them especially at night. if money is a real issue  it does not have to be a nurse- i have worked with cnas who would be great watchers....
wife fell  broke hip. er let me into exam rm accidently i think. nurse with badge on backwards gave he a shot of something and left. she would have died there if not for me. ran for help. then ekg tech hooked up the wires wrong. i am a biomedical equipment technician  their worst nightmare.
@sirsmilealot  i m sorry people are not treated properly and timely. never let a person give you or a loved one a shot. i would go so far as to say they should pop up the safety top and draw it up in front of you after showing you the vial. if they are unwilling to do that  call the doctor or patient services. if you aren t familiar with the med name look it up before giving taking it. i would not put it past the facility care provider to give you the one thing you don t want. they have shown themselves as complicit in this evil.
@sirsmilealot  my gawd! i m sorry to hear that. they are not to be trusted for a minute.
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  amen!
@c mcb  yup  secretly being done too
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  it s being done
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  and you ll get the one who doesn t ever want to work again  and she still couldn t overrule a dr. death.
wow! god bless you
god bless you  have faith. you got this you will feel good soon  keep the faith.
thanks for all you do. i felt the same only w less years of experience and went to work at a pn nursing school.  big difference.  no real stress
mine was accepted too but the coercion was so awful. how can you work with the thought that they can pull the plug are you at any time as far as your career goes and kick you out for not getting the jab. respiratory therapist here i work the front lines through. this whole pandemic was a hero and then coercion to push me towards early retirement. i said ok i m going.
@shelley zoe  wow. ik it s terrible what they did!!! i honestly think  they  ran the numbers and pushed plenty of people to early retirements with these ridiculous mandates. if there were enough experienced people such as yourself  standing up   saying  no  this wouldn t have happened imo. they know certain generations are in student debt. they know other generations are almost to retirement so their arguing days are over. not blaming any group of workers we all work hard..i m just saying what they did seems very calculated
@nm c  agree.. tried to  fight it  too scary  lose my pension etc. nope sorry.
i was one of a small few saying no.. alot took it  jab and did not want to for sure.
@nm c  once a health-care professional wakes up to reality  i don t expect them to leave the industry. but i do expect them to buck the narrative with their patients  off the record of course  and not follow harmful top-down protocols. compliancy tests of this nature are designed to purge    employees with above average morality and replace them with the least moral. those who ve never been to china are going to soon experience it.
@derp  good point. i do that w my nursing students now and i will continue when i have patients again. i switched from fnp major to msn and while i hate what has happened to healthcare im doubling down on my credentials so that i can properly fight for justice even if it s in a small sense
@shelley zoe   that is exactly what they are doing to the older teachers!  they know they are close to the finish line and just too damn scared of losing 1 2 of a 30 year pension and the medical coverage.  they stay quiet about what s happening in school.
@v den  wow not suprised...
@shelley zoe  now you know what pensions and unions are all about...they are about controling you  not  protecting  you.
@swisschalet  yep   i do. that s why elon musk was shunned by the government because he is nonunion.
i totally believe you. i filed an official complaint and they began an investigation yesterday. when i first called that line in allina the woman asked wearily if i was another employee. i am not. i have specific and outrageous detailed assertions that can be easily proved. this should be interesting. and it probably involves two hmo s. over a period of at least a decade. when i mentioned the doctor s name the call taker gasped and seemed to recognize the person. it involves punitive mental health diagnosis after much gaslighting and bait and bash by staff trying to make me angry. i know the routine as it is so common around the twin cities. are they in for a surprise!
you re very fortunate   blessed to have dr. jensen. i ve followed his interviews etc since the beginning of the  pandemic.  i also have family members with heart problems  2 of them almost died  since taking the  secret potion.  my husband s brother inlaw is disabled from a stroke post jab. they are all fairly young with no serious hlth problems prior to. wishing you continued blessings   good health! dr. jensen he has a big fan in the south
the picture of minneapolis nursing assistant jumai nache laying in a hospital bed with blackened hands and feet  which were later amputated  was so horrific  i thought that it had to be fake. her husband s lutheran church had set up a gofundme for jumai. i even called a minnesota and wisconsin branch of the church to verify this   she was forced to get the clot shot to keep her job. she got it  and within hours  started experiencing symptoms which ultimately led to the amputations. naturally  all of the medical staff blamed it on convid  and local network propaganda outlets have ignored her plight. yes  it s really this bad.
same thing is happening to my young grandaughter- she is now 6 yrs old.
truly disgusting. the dentist who pulled my son s teeth bruised my son so badly.
i am in the same position with 7 teeth. abcesses caused by a side effect from a prescribed drug.
my son who is 41 has never had a cavity in his life at every check up. he went to a dentist in my area in upstate  ny after covid to get his yearly checkup since he was visiting.  a dentist who saw him for the very first time examined him and presented him wit a treatment plan totaling  4 000   stating that he needed 2 root canals and 2-3 surface fillings and a cleaning. i was shocked at the treatment plan and took him the following day to another dentist office for a 2nd opinion...turns out he only had a one-surface cavity in a molar...that was all...! i was so angry to see that the first dentist absolutely lied. this is pure evil. please everyone  get a 2nd  3rd or more opinion when seeing a dentist. i ve lost trust in them  too  just like i ve lost all trust in medical doctors. caveat emptor!!!!
@bea g.o.  dentist carry on average  300 000- 400 000 in education debt   they are desperate for money.
@plain jane  may i ask which kind of medies cause that
let alone the antibiotics that have had an effect on him just to keep the 8nfection at bay. god bless you and your son.
good for you  those kids are lucky to have you
you are an excellent mother!  ignore those ignorant brainwashed fools who judged you.
my son passed out from the hpv vaccine. they said it was vaso vagal  but i cannot understand why this was the only vaccine that gave him a  nervous  reaction.
smart choice  stephanie  to cut off the endless gaslighting from the getgo  because it will only get worse if you should start complying
anything but the vaccine - sounds familiar....
retired bsn here too.  i couldn t do it anymore.
i am a pta and i can t agree more.  i was terminated for not taking the juice.  maybe an alternative healthcare system will arise.  it has become all about the   .
i am  too. sucks  doesn t it
i too are one who say well in advance what the medical system was doing and continue to do all in the name of greed!!!
i work as a rt and did through the  medical crisis  i was grateful for getting an exemption and still have my job but i see what pn is talking about and struggle with  keeping my job because of what i have seen going on.  i hope to retire this year.
charles  just like the education system  contradicts what they just taught us about human development.
@sharon abbott  all systems are rapidly deteriorating.
i retired on 12 30 22 after working 27 years as a rn. over my career i saw the continued demoralization of america society  as well as increased greed within the medical-industrial complex. it seems there s a different species of human out there.
yes!  rn here. i can t talk to nurse friends with scales over their eyes.   they get angry with any opinion.
same here.  i told my kids they better just let me die at home. because i won t go to a hospital.
rn here......i was done a while ago....i think there is more to come.
@r. l.  different species is correct....
@big red   yes  this is just the beginning.
@r. l.  ditto on everything you stated except for the date -- i retired in february 2005 after working 27 years as an rn.  i have no doubt that there s a different species and they seem to be increasing in numbers rapidly.
another bsn rn that left early. i loved being a nurse...as an icu nurse  it was truly an honor to care for pts and their families at what was likely the most stressful time in their lives.  it was ethically and morally painful to watch what was being done to covid pts. so sad to see what has become of our profession.
i too was a nurse for close to 20 years i changed jobs quite a bit before covid for me it was the spiral of healthcare when obama care came on the scene. i knew it would only get worse.
@truth seeker deliberately.
@sabrina devol  me too.  watch hospitalists who don t even read a patient s chart before quickly scribbling orders made me sick.  ridiculous that a patient s physician who knows them cannot see them in hospital outrageous!!  i have had excellent older docs tell me that is not even good hospital care for any patient.   but he said local docs went along because good they don t have to make hospital rounds.
their design and chess game is too on point. look at all the unfolding and their boldness. when a hurricane is ravaging your state in emergency and the leader of the  free  world goes on tv to say the best thing to do is go out and get vaccinated and people bury their heads in the sand  media says nothing and the masses still vote for these people....that says it all really. get healthy  stock up as best you can  be as independent as possible and pray
people need to do something about it other that just complain if not for yourselves than they need to do it for their loved ones.
i have experienced this! 3 of my mothers elderly friends died very suddenly and without reason  while in the hospital. just in last three years. if you have an elderly family member do not leave them alone in the hospital! no one should be without someone to look after them at the hospital.
thank you bob! yes  i agree obummercare definitely started the decline in u.s. healthcare. and god help us when the system starts routinely treating according to one s political status beliefs.
thank you be bop. i don t doubt that at all. but i m guessing it might be more common in urban or red-city hospitals.
this just happened to a friend of mine. his ex mother in law 82 and in  general good heath  caught that flu and she stopped eating so her hydration got real low so the daughters call the ambulance  because she couldn t walk well at all. when the sisters arrived  parked and got inside they were told she died.  just died and they didn t order an autopsy because the hospital said it was sad.
you sound like such a caring person. not!.
@starlite556  lol
the patient rights have been removed . i understand that they no longer have it posted in hospitals. there is a lot of complaining about the care now but no one is trying to do anything about it.
amen! bless you and your faith.
proud of ya.  i don t take any shzt at the. va. sorry ass doctors in the clinics i go straight to the. e room.
exactly right  grammy  preach it!!!!!!!!!!

aaaaaaaaaamen!!!!!!    so glad you stuck to your guns and you got through it!
me too had cancer  said ok to surgery only no chemo or radiation   wth no thank you! still here after 4 1 2 yrs.
@suz h  awesome!!!!  y all are wise ladies!!! we need a new slogan when it comes to mainstream medicine   just say no.
wow! i ve always thought that the horrible outcomes may be partly due to the horrible treatment. good for you!
medical staffers implore sympathy - then inveigle hospice!
check out dr. morse a naturopath and start a grape fast for at least a month or longer
i did the same thing.  had tumor tested for 5 types of chemo  none would have worked...  take control  know your body and you make decisions. thanks pn for all the info..
congratulations. hurray you took control over your decision! i am 36 years after modified radical mastectomy. multiple physicians  surgeon  oncologist  specialist thoracic surgeon to insert a porta-cath  and primary care   physician    tell me if i declined chemo i would die. they gave me a 1 year max with or without the treatment.  literally got furious with me  smh. anyways  as  28 year old  i chose not to take chemo. i had actually done investigation and found out that if i did live  the chemo would likely produce another cancer 30 years out.anyways  i m 64 and 36 years out. still alive and no further anything  praise the lord. i thank him for many answered prayer. you did good. this is your decision based on your priorities. blessings.
amen and amen !!!!!
prayers are with you.
amen! .
i am at 11 years  take care of yourself...
glad that i come from the land down under with nationalised health care and dont have to worry about this nonsense cheers.
5 yrs for me2 .stage 3 colon c .stayed over hydrated  flew through kemotook vitamins and other things  almost had another surgery for cancer months later    turns out it was a desmond tumor .thanks pn
was just having a conversation like this with my cousin not too long ago  of which we are of a like mind when it comes to this sorta thing. it s just such a shame that nobody can trust doctors or the medical establishment at all anymore to the point that they d rather just die with whatever condition they have. and i can t say i blame them  i m pretty much feeling the same way. it s truly disgraceful and despicable what they have done to our amazing institutions.
amen!!!!
after my husband and i being involved with the largest medical research facility in the us  same place as the  great  doctor f.a.u. c1. obviously that s with sarcasm  for 17 years  we were both traumatized when they had given him an iv of extra strength tylenol for pain when he had his last  7th  brain surgery. he was already a palliative care patient  but they had abruptly stopped his pain medications when we had arrived. nott only was he made to endure severe pain during brain surgery  he had to endure it while going through withdraw! i want to add that by husband had the 6th and 7th brain surgery at the same hospital  same place in his brain and done by the same neurosurgeon  but they never only gave him extra strength tylenol for pain! he has since refused to continue to fight for his life so he s now on home hospice  which i am his caregiver. what the hell is going on with this country ! if people don t start to take a stand against this insanity  we are done for!
as an rn who has worked in 3 major hospitals in a nw large city  this is 100  truth. i watched 30-40 rns and cnas leave one of my units during the plandemic.  it s bad out there. god bless you.
i ve been grieving for a year i left the icu.  i ve watched this video 6 x.     i felt like i was being gaslighted by hr before i left.   this video is epic.
my sister just suffered through exactly what you are talking about.  she had a very large kidney stone and was in a great deal of pain.  finding someone who even cared and wanted to treat it was very difficult.  it took a little over a week before she was finally able to get the surgery she desperately needed.  her bedside care was pitiful.  the nursing staff were blatantly telling her they just didn t have the time to take care of her on a routine basis.  getting medication for pain was awful.  she literally had  to beg for her medication that had been ordered by a physician.  thankfully she recuperated and made it home without anything worse happening to her during her stay.  i can honestly say that i live in fear of having to go to the hospital for any reason whatsoever.  i also heard that you definitely have to ask each time you are given an injection.  because if they know you have not had the jab  they may try to work it in during your hospital visit even if you have declined it.  so ask each time you are about to receive an injection regarding what it actually is so you can be aware if they are trying to just give you the jab without your knowledge because you are obviously too unstable to decide for yourself.  scary.
covid saved my life.  i was one on the termination list from the kid sniffer because of my refusal to participate in the experimental vaccine mandate.  i did exactly what patriot nurse recommended except i did it almost 2 years ago.  i changed my diet and lifestyle losing 52 pounds of visceral fat and dropping all 4 of my prescription medications because i no longer needed them.  i was pre-diabetic with fatty liver disease  on different blood pressure meds  meds for triglycerides and other prescriptions.  the mistreatment of me was my motivation to  teach them a lesson  that i m healthy enough without the shot.  of all things to open my eyes  i never thought it would be a planned viral outbreak from globalists.  great video patriot nurse  your the best!
this is so very true. i am appalled at the lack of empathy with this new generation of health care providers. scary!
being almost 70  i see so many flaws in this health care system.  one of the most awful things i now have to deal with is having to make an appointment  and here in oregon  one has to wait anywhere from 6 to 18 months to see a doctor. however  you don t get to see a doctor. they are nurses   not knocking them  but i  want a doctor.  then it s a video call no office visit.  then 8 people out of 10 get infections after having some type of surgery.   the system is totally broken!
in 2007 my grandpa was given a fatal injury in a nursing home. the nurse on the night shift at the hospital talked about how many patients like my grandpa that she had helped die. i must have looked horrified as she changed her wording to  helped transition . i was not in charge of my grandpa s care and nothing was done about either situation and he passed several days later. he was pushing 90 at the time so his life was no longer valuable to anyone except us. in my area  there is only one hospital that might be safe to go to and it s 90 minutes away from where i live. the local hospitals are crooked and inept. they did many false reports of c infections and deaths  probably still are . several motorcycle crash deaths were reported as c deaths. this world is evil and growing darker everyday.
yeah  i was hospitalized last year with covid and needed a longer oxygen tube so that they could stand up twice a day.  the nurse returned to my room and told me they were out of oxygen tubing.  i would also like to thank all the nurses out there.  the doctors and medicine may have kept me from dying but it was a nurse that made me want to live.  forever grateful to the nursing community!
you are spot on! as a nurse and as a family member of patients i have seen this big time in the last year! it s horrible! standard of care is so horrible  a lot of the good ones left and the others live in fear of the higher ups and they are so burned out!
i am an active 60 yr old man. i had an ac separation type 3 5. i m in the oklahoma city area. i am currently being treated at the va hospital. i was referred to an orthopedic surgeon. while waiting 7 days for my appointment i began treating myself with kt tape and homemade bone broth. when i was finally seen  the surgeon was surprised that the joint was back in place. it looks like i have avoided surgery.  i spent my first days after my accident reading every study from usa to australia to india and came up with my own treatment.
i noticed this when i was in the er a few months ago  was a horrible experience  as a retired nurse i was treated like crap and forgot for hours
wow you are so right. i was a hospital nurse for 44 years and even those of us who consistently strived to give good care were hindered by management and short staffing from doing it. we  fellow nurses  always used to joke that we would take care of each other when we become patients in the future. i am beyond thrilled to be retired.
you just validated what i feel. i would prefer to die at home than to go to a hospital. i might as well cancer my  1 200 a month health insurance. that insurance saved me from a near death accident 7 years ago  before the chaos started. thankfully my body has completely healed.
i m 63 and my wife is a beautiful 60. i m trying to keep myself in good shape. my weight creeps up in the winter but i still cycle i ve got a bad knee but it only needs to be cleaned out. now i m scared to even have that done. it doesn t hurt to cycle but it sounds like keeping in great shape is our only defense against this fascismwe re both unvaccinated
my family tries not to go the doctor hospital if we can treat them at home at all. my wife has read medical books for many years and has a great interest in it. wanted to be a nurse  but just didn t have the opportunity. all the family call her with their symptoms when they are sick and she is able to help them. can t get the meds if needed  but she is always right about the condition and what is needed. some things you just can t take care of yourself without help. she has had to tell an er doc what was needed and he has agreed she was right. we help all that we can. in her next life....
i was shocked when i took my barely 18 year old daughter to the er for extremes abdominal pain that led to nausea   throwing up. they wouldn t let me in with her  not a c-rule . i stood outside the door for 5 hours. she was crying  texting me that she wanted me .felt like she was going to pass out. she could hear the nurses telling each other that she was crying for attention. another girl  just a year to 2 older was having a miscarriage  bleeding that mother also not allowed. they discharged her with an diagnosis of nausea. a month later  2-3 weeks into her first year of college  same pain again  throwing up. she didn t want to go to the er due to the trauma of the last experience. her boyfriend thankfully insisted. this time  the hospital near where she goes to college  a very very small hospital. diagnosis  severe sepsis and appendicitis. she ended up having her appendix removed. i could have lost her if her boyfriend did not insist she go to the hospital. she was not alone at all except for overnight. the staff was so kind and truly cared. i am so thankful for this small rural hospital. none of my family will go to the other hospital  in our state s capitol  ever again.
i agree with much of what you speak.  as an er nurse that has worked in small and huge er systems. yes there are nurses who are not very personal or empathetic. in the other side many have been and are  treated so poorly by an increasing amount of people who don t follow direction want a magic pill for the problems that come from years of poor diet ect. violent patients are daily with no consequences to them.  people want servents not nurses. i often find myself parenting  adults . it gets old.  for many having problem you get what you give in life try looking in the mirror before blaming everyone else. for all the good people we empathetic hard working er nurse are still here just a little more haggard hange in there we are doing our best for you.
hospitals are tough. i worked in a number of them for 11 years both as staff and as a locum. some were better than others but none of them was good. one might presume that the joint commission standards makes a difference. they don t---for many reasons. if you are a clinician with genuine empathy for your patients and love what you do you will find it difficult to continue working in that environment. the politics  short-staffing  gossiping  backstabbing  and incessant greed for more profits. its all very toxic! there are still some good physicians and nurses out there but they are very few in number. if you re a patient in any hospital  never assume that the person providing your care actually cares anything about you. i ve been working in outpatient care and the greed  lack of professionalism  and slackness are present in this environment too. you must be an advocate for yourself. ask questions without being disrespectful. don t just blindly accept what what they say. the healthcare industry got a whole lot worse after the introduction of the affordable care act. and it continues to deteriorate because there is no true measurement of quality. it s all about the money now. hmos and other mega corporations have bought up most of the hospitals  clinics  and private practices  and all they really care about is bigger profits.the best thing any of us can do these days is to eat good food  get plenty of exercise  and keep our bodies healthy. if for any reason you find yourself needing to access the healthcare system be sure to say a prayer first.
i m so glad you re back and feeling better. i m sorry to say your reference to the failure of  healthcare industrial complex  is spreading to other industrial complexes  specifically law. the aba is becoming  woke.  if this isn t reversed  no patriot will ever win a case in court. always vet your legal counsel via social media etc.  but most attorneys are smart enoght to be  a political.  be sure to  interview an attorney before retaining one. find out how they feel about the current state of affairs and direction the country is heading. they ll tell you  by their body language. choose only conservative attorneys. it s our only hope.
good lord! tylenol does nothing for pain.
yeah  you can thank the opioid epidemic for that debacle and the drug addicts that followed.  now doctors are super paranoid to even consider ordering a narcotic for their patient s  due to fear of potential addiction issues or government investigation scrutiny. it s so unfair because those who really do need it for legit acute care pain relief are being inappropriately mistreated with over-the-counter analgesics that are not as effective.  my first nursing job was in 1998. that is when the joint commission was pushing for us to assess pain as the 5th vital sign. of course  if anyone had pain  we had to offer pain medication and document the before and after results. that is when the explosion of addiction happened and it perpetually worsened over the years. it went from doctors writing scripts like the meds were pez candy to an anorexia of such orders or prescriptions. i think there certainly needs to be protection from potential addictions  but when withheld completely when appropriate and necessary  it is wrong because it leads to undo suffering. so the drug addicts continue to get their fix from the streets  while those who truly qualify for valid medical reasons are denied.
we need you on the front lines.  try to get supplied up and avoid products from china.  reincorporate your knowledge and skills and apply accordingly when the time comes.  you ll  be ready.
i had a backed-up kidney  hydronephrosis  from a lithotripsy complication.  because surgeons don t work on holiday weekends  i had to wait days to get a stent.  i gained and lost over 10 pounds of water!
get off sugar   refined  processed foods. do intermittent fasting.
@saraswati  i had to laugh at your post because that s exactly what i did.  i dropped all sugar drinks  refined and processed foods then went on an 18 6 if program.  subsequently i have and will continue to perform prolonged fasts of 2 to 5 days about every 6 weeks.  if you have never fasted don t judge me because fasting is he healthiest and best feeling i have ever experienced.  strange how you can go 24 to 96 hours without food and not be the slightest bit hungry and have the energy of a child again.  thank you for your reply.
i have seen all the known mrsa s that have come into the united states. i refused the jab every time i was told it was good. my doctor asked one time if i wanted it. i said no. he smiled and we went on treating me as a patient. i ask him questions  he gives me as much of an answer as is possible. we are good with that.
right on mark. fantastic to hear the positive change.
and do not eat packaged foods that have additives.
the number one cause of being overweight is carbohydrates. yes  sugar is the obvious one  but bread and pasta are actually the larger contributors because they represent a large portion of our handed diets. look into keto  where you can eat all the meat  eggs  cheese  and vegetables you want  and you ll lose weight towards healthy.
please pray for me! i m having terrible stomach attacks. i m on a mission to lose 60 pounds. i m guessing rolled oats are out! i mixed an 1 8 of a cup with moringa  manuka honey and fresh berries and turmeric and saigon cinnamon. i ll ditch that and i plan to eat lots of berries  fresh greens  cabbage steaks and salmon  sardines  tuna.  any advice on how y all dropped the weight is appreciated.
whole30 was what i did when doctor told me i was prediabetic. took me a year of clean eating to shed 65 lbs. if i had been exercising regularly it would have been quicker and the extra skin would have been lessened. currently exercising 3 days a week and some of the flab is turning to muscle! the weight loss took care of my high sugar and the cholesterol. i have a new wardrobe and feel so much better and can do so much !! and i will be 71 years young in february!
@nadine petersen  wow! 71 and you did all of that.  that s something to realty be proud of.  ok  so lets talk wardrobe.  i was a small man at only 5 6  and 185.  i just bought 6 pair of new jeans at the store that fit me fine at 34  regular fit.  after a couple of months they practically fell of of me.  the wife was proud of my accomplishments but told me i should have waited on buying over  200 in jeans so i went back to the same store and bought 6 pair that now fit me at 32   you know what i m fixing to say next  yes it happened again.  in the top of my closet were two rolls of jeans labeled 34  and 32 .  i felt so bad about wasting money because were far from rich but i loved my progress.  i bought 3 pair of 30  slim fit afterwards but again they went baggy after a couple more months.  the end of my wardrobe story is i now bought 6 pair of 28  slim fit wrangler jeans because i knew i was not going to lose anymore weight.  i now have 3 rolls of jeans labeled 30   32   and 34  thinking that if i ever gained my weight back they would come in handy.  i can promise you they will never fit again because i feel so good living this way i ll never go back.  thank you for you story!
@e wood  i ll tell you exactly what i did.  it was through the youtube channel  dr. berg .  1  i dropped all sugar drinks and sugar snacks like candy and cake.  2  i started an 18 6 intermittent fast program and 3  ran as fast as i could away from carbs like bread and pasta.  i will be honest telling you i almost didn t make it the first 10 days due to sugar withdrawals but once i conquered them  i felt much better.  after a couple of months of 18 6 i went to omad  one meal a day  and would throw in prolonged fasts of 24 to 48 hours about once a month.  counting calories and exercising may be a good thing but people always gain the weight back after a few months.  through fasting i have controlled my insulin production and as hard as this is to believe i can easily go on a 5 day fast and i m never hungry after i  reprogramed  my metabolism using intermittent fasting.  i don t know if you are a male or female but i ll tell you this all started by me  a man  watching a youtube  ted talk  with cynthia thurlow on woman s weight loss and health.  what she said amazed me so much i didn t believe it so i searched other videos and that s how i ended up with dr. berg and thomas delaur s intermittent fasting programs.   i would suggest watching her video.  note   if you decide to do the intermittent fast you cannot cheat at all  not one bite.  that s what gets most people.  during your fasting time just 1 2 of a cookie or snack makes your pancreases produce insulin and you will have a large insulin spike that takes several hours to go away.  insulin is the fat storing hormone  don t cheat and i promise the pounds will fall off.
@e wood  praying for you  but you also need support  accountability and a provider who can walk with you and your specific situation. no one side fits all  whatsoever. find a functional medicine practitioner. prayer and action! go!
@mark white  fasting also helps clear the mind. it makes me more empathetic.
@derp  a couple of years ago i would laugh at that statement.  today i respond by saying  it sure does.
@mark white  a couple of years ago i laughed at conspiracy theorists and christians. ignorance was bliss.
there is no better defense against bad health than eating whole foods and eliminating carbs  sugar and seed oils. i went keto 7 years ago and full carnivore 10 months ago. i feel better now at 49 than i did in my 20 s. i have not been sick in years despite refusing the kid sniffer shot.
@dave m  my biggest surprise of all was the seed oil.  i had no idea they were bad for you.  after all they are vegetable oils and vegetables are good for us right   truthfully i don t know if it was the sugar or seed oils but i m 60 and have dealt with arthritis for about 10 years.  especially in the fingers and wrists.  after keto i solved the math equation 0 sugar and 0 seed oil   0 inflammation   0 arthritis pain   0 daily ibuprofen.  i literally ate those pills like candy and i m afraid i took so many i harmed my liver or kidneys.  routine blood work and liver function tested ok so maybe i just got lucky.  my pills have changed from olmesartan  amlodapine  trilipix  singular  pepsid ac and ibuprofen to omega 3  d3 k2 combination  multivitamin  zinc and magnesium.  i feel better at 60 than i did at 40  guarantee you.
wow! i m loving all the success stories. kudos to y all. i m a 53 yo female. i live alone on 10 acres in the high desert. it s very rural out here in the high desert. i ve tried keto before and honestly it gives me a ton of energy in the beginning so much that i can t sleep at all. then something seems to happen with my electrolytes or something and it feels like every muscle in my body is gone and i feel extremely weak. right now i m eating stuff like 2 brussels sprouts shredded with 2 anchovies mixed into eggs. i m having teas with manuka honey. i stopped drinking coffee and stevia. i ll have an apple mid day and usually a salad of fresh greens  salmon or sardines with mct oil.  or a cabbage steak with chicken or salmon.  i eat my last meal about 5 30 pm. if i m feeling hungry at night in bed i ll drink some of my homemade bone broths. i m down 5 pounds since sunday. i haven t felt hungry at all. i bought loads of salmon  sardines  anchovy  all organic...purple cabbage  asparagus  mushrooms  brussels sprouts  beets  fresh greens. luckily  i love all this food. dropping the rice and pasta hasn t been difficult so far. i don t eat bread or drink sodas. never have liked cokes or sugary drinks. i did buy 100  cranberry and aloe vera juice and i pour about an ounce of each into a mason jar and fill with sparkling water. that s to help cure an ulcer i m pretty sure i have. thanks for all of the great information. i m going to keep at this. i garden year round and i need to start walking. especially while the weather is so nice. blessings to you all.
@mark white  that s fantastic that you were able to eliminate the daily ibuprofen. i had no idea how bad seed oils were either. in my case i had already cut out sugar before quitting seed oils so that made me realize how bad seed oils are. i had a lot of arthritis pain in my knees that is almost completely gone now. i can hike big mountains now without being in agony on the way down. my chronic migraines are completely gone now as well. i don t get sunburns anymore either which is amazing since i have very fair skin.
@e wood  not eating enough fat on keto can make you feel weak   i made that mistake in the beginning. mostly though  the weakness is your body detoxifying from sugar intake. it can take a while for people s bodies to switch from burning glucose to ketones after becoming fat adapted. that s usually why people give up on the diet  they lose patience not realizing that our bodies don t heal overnight after a lifetime of feeding themselves sugar and carbs.
@dave m  - i was entering everything and tracking the fat  protein  carbs  sugars.  is it supposed to happen around the third or fourth week   i ve read about the keto flu  but i don t think this is what happened. i literally had so much energy i was bouncing off the walls. i live in the mountains so  i was hiking twice a day. then  i would garden for hours. after a week of trying to burn off the crazy energy  i crashed hard. i couldn t lift my arms. it s as if i had no muscles at all. i had a few ppl tell me to drink pickle juice. i also tried drinking acv  organic lemon juice  stevia and water. which i have loved in the past. that s when i started to figure out something was wrong with my stomach. later that night i thought i was having a heart attack. the pain was horrible and my chest burned into my back. nothing helped ease the pain. no antacids  pepto  milk of magnesia. it lasted all night.  i m having a spoonful of manuka honey in my teas. i will continue that with the way i m eating for now. hopefully my gut will heal and i ll lose some weight.  also  other than dark chocolate  i m not a sweet eater. my problem is rice  pasta  and eating too much and too late. i was also drinking alcohol. i ve completely cut that too.
@e wood  yes typically it does happen around the 3rd or 4th week but i ve heard dr. anthony chaffee and dr. ben bikman mention  that it can take up to 3 months for some people which is why i think a lot of people give up. you definitely didn t have the keto flu because that only happens in the first few days when your body is detoxing from sugar which is a drug. i have some gut issues myself so i know what you re going through. that was why i switched to the carnivore diet because i have been on ppi medication for years for acid reflux. carnivore has improved it significantly to the point where i reduced my dose from 40mg prescription to 20mg otc. my goal is to eventually get off them completely. too much fiber can actually cause gut issues believe it or not. when i switched from keto to carnivore i lost an additional 25 pounds that i could never lose on keto  the weight literally just fell off in a month and a half. i now weigh the same as what i did in high school even though i basically eat as much fatty meat as i want. i live in the white mountains of new hampshire so i hike all the time too  i can hike all day without stopping or even eating anything and still have a constant  even energy all day. it s pretty amazing how your body feels when it s burning ketones.
@dave m  - i will gradually wean myself from the manuka honey. right now i just want to heal my gut and lose weight    i m a 6 gen native texan so carnivore diet also sounds good. i m also a prepper so  i can tons of meats.  i think you re right about too much fiber. i was eating huge salads  but also still drinking wine or vodka w club soda. my stomach was always a mess. i m eating small salads and no alcohol at all. it s getting better. i m headed back to the store tomorrow for more salmon  sardines  avocado and stuff for more bone broths.  thanks for the advice. i m going to look up carnivore. i ve heard about it  but never looked into it. i also just stopped taking anything big pharma after 23 years being on 2 bp meds. i m trying to treat that naturally  so  i ll be sticking to a high fish diet for awhile.
@e wood  you re definitely on the right track eating lots of fish  salmon and sardines are great! i eat those and mackerel too. getting rid of alcohol was a big help for my health as well. i m a prepper as well so i liked canned meats. another good thing to look into is pemmican. if you make it with just meat and tallow it has a very long shelf life and is very tasty. congratulations on getting off the big pharma meds  that s so important for good health and why i want to get off omeprazole. i m almost positive my gut issues are from that because it raises the ph of your stomach acid and it blocks mineral absorption. check into carnivore when you get a chance  i will never eat any other way because i feel so good. it cured my chronic migraines  took away the arthritis pain in my knees  took 5 inches off my waist and 25 pounds plus i don t really get sunburned anymore if you can believe that. my gums and teeth have improved as well. my hiking performance is much better also  i have steady energy all day even if i don t eat that day. i can fast easily if i want  i have fasted for 72-80 hours a bunch of times. i never think about food anymore during the day  i only eat one meal at night. i feel like i m free of all the food addictions i used to have.
@dave m  - that sounds absolutely amazing! i think i will try it after i go through the greens and vegetables i just bought. i looked into carnivore yesterday and of course i read loads of pros and cons. i have noticed eating all this fish  i m not as hungry. i have my last meal at 5 30 pm. if i m feeling so hungry i can t sleep  i drink some bone broth. it does the trick. i typically eat breakfast about 10-11. i ll have a snack around 2 pm. then the final meal at 5 30. i ll be doing my weekly weigh in monday. i m anxious to see if i ve lost a decent amount. i m feeling better so that counts a lot.  i m headed to the store for meats! i m replenishing my broths i ve been drinking. can you have mushroom broth on carnivore  i m thinking probably not. i do save all of the tallow and chicken fat when i makes broths. what was your starting weight and where are you now
@e wood  7 years ago when i started keto i weighed 295  i m 6 2   and was able to get down to 225 which was my high school weight but i had to really workout hard and not eat as much as i wanted to maintain that weight so my weight would always want to creep back up to 245-250. last march when i switched to carnivore i weighed 250. i measured my true waist  just above belly button  and it was 43 . i am now down to 225 and my true waist is 37 . i dropped a couple pant sizes. most of that weight was lost in the first month and a half. i feel great now. during the summer i pulled a hamstring cutting wood so i couldn t hike or exercise for 6 weeks and even then i was still losing weight without exercise. that s great that you like bone broth  i drink a lot of it and people have commented that i m aging in reverse now. mushroom broth wouldn t be considered carnivore but you could always try adding it back later and see how it affects you if you miss it. i would recommend trying carnivore for 90 days minimum and see how you feel at the end of those 90 days. tallow and chicken fat are great for carnivore. do all of your cooking with those and don t use any seed oils. i would recommend measuring your true waist as well as checking the scale because losing fat is actually more important than losing weight. sometimes the scale didn t move for me but i was still losing inches off my waist so use the tape measure as a motivator even more than the scale  plus go by how you feel. i originally intended to try carnivore for 90 days but once i felt the way i do i had no desire to go back to eating vegetables. i don t eat any dairy other than butter or ghee because i m sensitive to dairy but you may not be. if you eat cheese use it as a condiment rather than food. don t be afraid to eat a lot of fat and eat until you re pleasantly full. check out dr. anthony chaffee on youtube  he s a good resource and also the steak and butter gal  she gears her channel more towards women on carnivore. it s good to stick to 3 meals a day in the beginning while you re trying to get your body fat adapted. the only time i need electrolytes is when i m sweating a lot while hiking  i use  keto chow electrolytes.
@dave m  - that s fantastic. i don t drink milk and i used to put a splash of cream in my coffee  but i gave up both for now. i do like goat cheese  but it s not something i have to have. i went to the store this morning and i put a pot of beef bone broth on before i left. then put on a pot of mushroom broth and 2 huge pots of chicken bone broth. before i knew it it was 3pm and my stomach was growling  but not badly. i  sliced some avocado  opened a can of wild caught sardines and put boiled eggs crumbles and green onion and that ended up being all i ate today. i ve been chopping beef  pork  and chicken and canning my butt off. i think i may have just started where i get crazy energy and not too hungry. i better not overdue it in the garden.  it s supposed to be almost 80 tomorrow. i will check out the chicks link for carnivore. thanks for the recommendation.
@dave m  - okay  i m really starting to get excited about carnivore. i still have cabbage  brussels sprouts  cucumber and fresh greens to use up  but i m thinking february is a great month to start carnivore. i ve been binge watching laura spath. she lost 120 pounds doing carnivore. i need to lose 60 pounds. i also bought a bunch of packages of chicken drumsticks to can up. i ll have those for february. i prefer to eat filet mignon  but i ll try to start buying some fattier steaks and i don t usually eat bacon  but i ve put that on my list too. every comment on these carnivore channels are just amazing. this is going to be my year to shed this weight and take back my health. thanks so much for the inspiration.
@e wood  yeah laura spath is great. another good one to watch is kelly hogan  she lost over 100 pounds i think and has kept it off for over a decade. i m excited for you! i can t recommend this diet enough  i feel amazing on it. i have healed so many things with it. i don t know if i mentioned this to you but i haven t really gotten a sunburn since i started carnivore  i can stay out in the sun all day now without sunscreen. it s crazy  i guess it s because seed oils cause the issues people have with sun burning easily so once you eliminate them from your diet things go back to the way they should be.
@dave m  - i checked out kelly hogan. good stuff. the more i hear and see the more motivated i am. i m actually eating less and less vegetables and adding more meats and fats. i ll be ready for full blown carnivore by february 1 or sooner. i m down 5.4 pounds this week and 10.4 pounds total since january 1.  not bad for 9 days. i m feeling really good too. i have too much energy again  though. i m not sleeping.
@e wood  congrats on the weight loss  10 pounds in 9 days is nothing to sneeze at. i m glad you liked kelly hogan  she has great energy and seems down to earth. she s been a very successful carnivore for a long time with all good health markers so i know it can work long term.
@dave m  - yes agree. i just watched dr. berry do and q a while i was working. more good stuff. i did a walk last night after work. a mini walk this morning before work. and i did a 1 4 mile hike during lunch. i m not even out of breath! i ll definitely be doing these 3x a day. the energy is crazy again. i know why i had that crash last time. i m not a salt eater! i m salting everything now. i never knew i needed to increase salt  electrolytes  when cutting carbs. it makes sense  though.   i also took your advice and others and i m increasing the fat. cooked salmon in lard this morning with 2 eggs. lots of salt. i m still stuffed as if i just ate. yesterday i was hungry at 3pm so i ate sardines  1 egg  1 2 cucumber and 1 2 beet. still trying to use up the last of my vegetables. i wasn t hungry for the rest of the day. i did have some bone broth about 9 30 because i was feeling peckish. it did the trick. my only problem is trying to sit still so i can work. my body wants to get up and go!!!!
forks over knives  dr mcdougal eat all you want!
@e wood  that s awesome  it sounds like you are doing great so far. i love dr. berry  he is very down to earth. him and dr. chaffee plus nina teicholz were my main influences for trying carnivore. dr. berry  dr. chaffee and kelly hogan are in costa rica right now  filming season 3 of reversed which is a show about people reversing type ii diabetes and other illnesses with keto and carnivore. i totally forgot to mention the salt thing to you  i m glad you found it. judy cho has some good videos on salt. it s a pretty individualized thing so you have to figure out what works for you. i seem to do better with more salt. i use redmond s or himalayan pink salt. if i know i m going to be hiking all day in hot weather i will mix keto chow electrolytes in with my water. it s just  salt  potassium and magnesium. other than that i don t supplement electrolytes other than salt on my food.
@dave m  - i think i ll go by my little natural food store here and see what they have for electrolytes. i do have redmond  himalayan pink  and kosher salt. yesterday  i was not bouncing off the walls. i didn t feel badly  though. i m still not sleeping. i keep wondering when that will start happening.  i ve been down on the scale everyday. this morning was only .2  but i ll take it. i didn t walk or hike yesterday because i was feeling too tired. i feel pretty good today and we have a one day cold front lol. i ll probably go on a walk for lunch. i m thinking about freezing or dehydrating the last of my vegetables because i really want to advance to complete carnivore. i wasn t drinking coffee for awhile  but had some yesterday with butter and a couple of drops of stevia. i did the same this morning and both times i also sprinkled a tiny bit of salt in it too.  should i not be drinking any coffee when i switch to complete carnivore
@brian harris  - i m eating all i want and overall feeling better than i have in a year.  i grow a vegetable garden all year long. i love homegrown everything  but i was feeling massively fatigued everyday and it didn t make sense that i was overweight and sluggish eating so many vegetables. i had nothing to lose trying a new way of eating and all i can say is so far my stomach is so much better  my energy level is off the charts most days. i m dropping weight like crazy. we all need to do what works best for our individual bodies. what works for one doesn t work for another.   be blessed.
@e wood  it s better to not drink coffee if you can but i tell people to worry about quitting that last. i quit coffee way before i went carnivore because of acid reflux issues. i was completely addicted to coffee. i used to drink two pots of coffee a day. i feel way better since i quit but it was difficult to get off of coffee. if you haven t done so yet i recommend you take some measurements of yourself like waist circumference just above your belly button  etc. that way if the scale ever plateaus on you the tape measure can still motivate you. sometimes the scale doesn t move but the tape measure does during the process. i never got to experience butter in my coffee since i quit before i went carnivore but it sounds delicious. i will sometimes boil water and melt ghee into it for a hot drink in the cold. even that is really good.
@dave m  - i m definitely not coffee addicted. i have one cup in the morning. i m one of those rare people that actually get a headache from too much caffeine. i m loving buttered coffee right now. i bought decaf some coffee today. i did take my measurements this week. extremely traumatized now. for some reason the scale didn t scare me as much as those horrific inches. more encouragement!  i m still down each morning  even if it s only .2. i m noticing i m only able to eat about 1 2 to 1 3 of my plate of food. i m still having two meals a day  but i can easily see that becoming one meal. my last meal was about 3 30pm yesterday. i went into town this morning to fill up with gas and the store cooks breakfast and the smell was strong. it didn t trigger any hunger at all. then  i went to the store to pick up some steaks  butter  duck fat  lard  etc... i wasn t hungry at all while shopping. my first meal was about 11 15 am. i m interested to see if i m hungry later or not.
@e wood  the inches are what scared me straight. ken berry did a video a while back about metabolic syndrome and mentioned waist to height ratio should be 0.5 or less but mine wasn t so that was what pushed me to get serious and try carnivore. the last time i checked a few months ago my ratio is now 0.51 so i m just about there. when i started it was 0.58. i m generally doing one meal a day on work days and two when i m at home. make sure you eat enough when you do eat  sometimes if we don t eat enough on carnivore our body will hold on to the extra fat instead of burning it. it is pretty amazing how much your hunger will change. eating for me has become totally optional on some days. if i m really busy and don t have time to cook i might just decide to do a fast. i love the sense of freedom that it gives you  food no longer runs my life. i eat to live instead of living to eat so i m able to focus on other things. oh yeah  check out browned butter bites. i make those sometimes for a treat  they taste amazing! i keep them in the freezer.
@dave m  - thanks so much for all the awesome information. i was just thinking yesterday how nice it would be to be one of those people that eat to live and not live to eat! i m going to check out the video and browned butter bites now
@e wood  you re very welcome! i m glad i could give you some useful information. i feel very free now that food doesn t control my life.
@dave m  - well  i had my first bad experience. i drank sparkling mineral water yesterday afternoon and then i decided to make my last meal at 3 30 so i could eat by 4pm and fast until today. however  i wasn t super hungry at 4pm  but i ate anyway. i ended up having a bad heartburn episode. when i have this it lasts for hours and nothing relieves the pain. i m going to stick to less fatty meats  no more fizzy water for a long time either. everyone thinks i have gallbladder issues  but i won t go to a doctor. the good news is i m down 14 pounds total today. i had my butter coffee this morning and i drank decaf because my stomach still feels a bit tender. it went down okay. i may do bone broth only all day today.
@e wood  congrats on the 14 pounds  that was fast! it went like that for me too  the weight came off immediately. i tend to have issues with sparkling water too  as much as i love to drink it. i ve been dealing with reflux for decades now. when i first started carnivore and started eating a lot more fat my reflux went crazy. i ve been on 40mg of esomeprazole for years now and even that wasn t working. my ex girlfriend is a nurse practitioner and she told me to take a box of pepcid  h2 blockers  for a couple weeks. i did and everything calmed down. i didn t have to take any more once the box was finished. i think my body was just adjusting to the increased fat. now my reflux has actually improved quite a bit. i m taking the 20mg otc omeprazole rather than the prescription stuff and hope to wean myself even further eventually. i also use gaviscon if i eat really late  it does help with the reflux symptoms. i use the stuff made in the uk  they sell it on amazon but it s not available in the us. carnivore has definitely improved my reflux quite a bit  i just had to get past that initial adjustment time in the beginning. i would also fast for 3 days if my issues got really bad to just to give my gut a break. i m trying to heal decades of abuse to my body so it s not going to happen overnight. there are a lot of people who have cured their reflux symptoms completely with carnivore. jordan peterson cured his  he s mentioned it in multiple interviews.
@dave m  - i took 1 omeprazole last night and 1 this morning. i need to go to the store for more. that was my last one. i ll try taking it for 30 days. i m pretty sure that sparkling water did a number along with the fat. i ve had a big cup of bone broth this morning. i m starting to feel hungry so i think i ll just have some scrambled eggs cooked in butter and more broth throughout the day. i m on a mission to drop 40  by march.   i do a weigh in with 2 girlfriends each monday. needless to say  i m way ahead.  i haven t craved any sweets except dark chocolate. i won t need the butter brown bits. i didn t know what it was  i did cave yesterday and i ate one small square of dark chocolate. that probably contributed to the stomach attack too.
@e wood  that s a good idea to take omeprazole for a few weeks while your body gets used to the increased fat. the dark chocolate may have had an effect on you as well so don t rule that out either. definitely keep going with the bone broth  i drink that daily. eggs are always awesome  i typically eat 6 or more a day.
@dave m  - i finally got some sleep last night and my stomach feels back to normal again for now.  no weight loss today. i managed to eat scrambled eggs for brunch and deviled eggs for dinner with a lot of bone broth early in the day. nothing past 4 pm. i didn t make it to the store for ppi. i may have to pick some up this weekend. i m definitely not having anymore dark chocolate. that one piece actually fixed the craving i was having. typically after a stomach attack  i don t want the culprits that brought it on. so  fizzy water  dark chocolate  are out and i will eat the meat  but probably not the fat in the meat for awhile. i ll continue with butter and animal fats for cooking  though. did you or do you eat avocado  i know some carnivores do and some don t. i ve had small amounts here and there. i had a quarter of one left and mixed it into my deviled eggs. also  i ve heard everyone say their faces clear up and acne disappears  but i seem to be breaking out for some reason. hopefully  my body is just releasing toxins and it s temporary.
@e wood  i don t eat avocados. i used to cook with avocado oil until i found out that a lot of manufacturers of olive oils and avocado oils cut their oil with seed oils so i use nothing but animal based fats to cook with now. i had issues with dry skin before carnivore  but they have gone away. i still get occasional acne but it s pretty rare now. it used to be regular before carnivore. most people have their skin issues clear up. oh yeah  don t be afraid to eat that fat.  bring it back in slowly though to make sure your gut can handle it.
@dave m  - i have noticed my feet are a lot softer. they were very cracking on my heels. i don t know if that s because of the diet  but they are soft again out of the blue. i have been soaking in epsom salts at night too. i ll bring back the fat after i m sure my gut can handle it for sure. i m feeling pretty tired everyday again. i ve bumped up my potassium today. i also take magnesium and other supplements. i only sleep maybe 2-3 hours each night. it s very frustrating. i wake up at 1am wide awake. even if i go to sleep at 11pm. i can t wait for that awesome sleep everyone talks about to kick in
@e wood  my heels used to be very cracked too. that improved years ago when i went keto and is even better now on carnivore. i m not positive but i think cracked heels are a symptom of insulin resistance. skin tags are another sign of insulin resistance. hopefully you can sleep soon  i sleep very well. if i eat a big meal before bed it will also make me sleepy.
@dave m  - yikes. i read skin tags are a sign of diabetes or pre diabetes. i started getting them all under my boobs. i also started getting eczema  i think  last summer. the insides of my elbows would get a rash. never super bad or itchy  though. i had to go into town today for the ppi s. i was feeling pressure again last night. i also bought crazy water  mineral water  electrolyte drops and trace minerals to add to my water. i had my butter coffee this morning and then ate salmon and eggs at 1pm. that s going to be my only meal until tomorrow. if i m starving later  i ll have some tea with mct oil or some bone broth. i ve been the same weight for 3 days in a row.  i knew it would slow down  though. i m sticking to this woe through march. thanks again for all the advice. i don t know anyone that s ever tried carnivore or anyone that will try it with me
@dave m  - i m feeling sooo much better today! having my butter  mct  coffee now. i made it eating only one meal. i did have a small cup of bone broth about 7 30 pm. i m down 15 pounds as of this morning.  hopefully today will go the same and i ll continue with the trace minerals in the crazy water.
@e wood  you re very welcome  i m glad you re having success. 15 pounds is a lot in such a short time. i used to have tons of skin tags too  i don t get them any more. i m pretty sure i was prediabetic and i think i had metabolic syndrome as well. i think i was getting eczema in between my fingers also and that doesn t happen anymore. i haven t been able to get anyone in my circle to try carnivore with me either except my 20 year old son told me the other night he s going to try it. he has acid reflux already that he wants to make better. you should take some measurements on yourself right now  that way if you run into a plateau you can gauge if you re losing inches or not.
@dave m  - i already took measurements by your sound advice  it was traumatizing.  i ll check them again february 2. i stayed the same weight for 3 days in a row so  it s definitely slowing down. i ve started omad. today is my second day. i ate a huge meal. grilled a new york strip  a salmon filet and 2 over easy eggs along with 4 cubes of hard cheese. i had steak leftover  but managed to shovel all of the rest down.   if i get peckish  i just drink some tea with salted butter or mct oil. it s 5 30 and i still feel as if i just ate. i ll take a bath and get in bed by 6 30-7pm. i just chill in the evenings so  i m not even tempted to eat. it really has been pretty dang easy so far. especially since buying the trace minerals. i definitely don t feel deprived. i still crave dark chocolate  but i don t give in. i hope your son will give it a go. i m trying to talk my niece into doing it. i send her pictures of what i m eating everyday. she thinks she ll try after she moves from florida to nc.   you were the one that got me to look into this woe! i m super glad.
@e wood  i m glad your journey is going good so far and i m happy you decided to listen to me haha. you re the first person who has taken my advice on trying this  people usually tell me there s no way they could just eat meat even though i rattle off a bunch of health issues that it s solved for me. oh yeah  i love new york strips  i have a bunch in the fridge ready to cook. i m going to have some later once i get hungry.
@dave m  - i m up 2 ounces this morning  lol. maybe my omad was too massive. i bought the new york strips because the ribeyes out here are so thin. i usually prefer filets  but they aren t fatty. meat is slim pickens as well as most groceries out here. i m sure it will only get worse. i ve got to go into town this morning so  i m thinking of grabbing up as much decent meat as possible and can a bunch more. i did 86 jars of meat and bone broths 2 weekends ago. time to do some more. i haven t been able to buy propane out here for months! i had 6 20  tanks  but i use them for canning. i bought a smaller canner to use inside on the glass top stove. fingers crossed i can get a few tanks refilled. going to need to grill my salmon and steaks on occasion. i have tons of charcoal stashed too  but i need a charcoal grill.  have a great weekend.
@e wood  that s rough that you re so thin on supplies  especially propane. i wonder why that is  it s readily available where i live. if you decide to get a charcoal grill the cheap weber kettles work great  i ve been using one of those for a while now. you can even smoke with it. i make a lot of ground beef so i ll cook it indirectly on the weber with chunks of red oak  beech  hickory or maple for smoke. i do that with ribeyes too  indirect over smoke until the internal temp is 110f then i ll sear it at the end over the flame on each side to finish it off. i have a propane smoker as well for longer smoking like pork butts or brisket but you can also do longer smokes on the weber if you want  i ve done it. have a nice weekend!
@dave m  - all that sounds super delicious. i was able to drive to a commercial and residential dealer and they filled my 4 tanks and i had 2 that were still pretty full. i m wayyyyyy out in the boonies lol. if there is coughs   supply chain issues  it hits little towns like mine first. it s extremely desolate out here. i m near big bend national park in texas  if you care to look it up. you ll see how remote it is. i m in the largest county in texas  but it s the least populated. i love it.  i just canned 16 jars of beef and pork ribs. i m fixin  to can up 7 quarts of beef roast  ribs  and steaks. tomorrow i ll do chicken and bone broth. so happy to have all my tanks filled. in case we can t get meat  i ll be set for a good long while. i was up .2 again this morning. i m just hoping i ll be down on mondays weigh-in day.  i did end up having 2 smaller meals yesterday instead of one meal. sardines w 1 boiled egg and 2 over easy eggs. then i heated chicken bone broth and added 3 scrambled eggs and one boiled for a delicious egg drop soup. that was it for yesterday. it really is very satisfying eating this way.
@e wood  i looked up your area  you are definitely way out there. it s beautiful country  looks way different than where i live. i m next to the white mountain national forest in new hampshire so it s heavily forested. i can see why getting supplies could be tough for you. i m in a rural area but i m only a 3 1 2 hour drive from boston so there are tourists here a lot. that s awesome that you can a lot of beef  it s good to stay prepared. i have a good stockpile myself as well. during covid the shelves at the stores were bare  it doesn t take long for the supply chain infrastructure to fall apart. i make bone broth on a continuous basis and my chickens keep me well stocked with eggs. i m glad you re liking this way of eating so far  i could never go back to eating the way i used to.
@dave m  - i m down 2 more pounds today!!! woohooo! that s 17 total now since january 2. i fried 4 chicken thighs in lard and ate 1 with half a grilled ribeye and an over easy egg. i love this woe. it s been so crazy easy. you were god sent to this comment section.  i never would have taken this leap without you and i m so grateful. my birthday is in march and i plan on hitting my goal of 40 pounds by then.  i m back to having more energy again  but i m not sleeping at all! i m taking melatonin every night too. the most i can sleep is 2-3 hours tops.  i got my greenhouse all cleaned out and started more compost. it s funny  i m not eating any vegetables  but i really love gardening. maybe i can make some extra money selling them at the farmers market on saturdays.  tomorrow is weigh-in day and i m excited to brag to my two girlfriends that are doing different things  but we re all trying to lose weight. i m gonna check out your neck of the woods!
@dave m  - i ve been extra hungry today and i m up 1.4 pounds. i realized i m not eating enough fat. even fried chicken thigh is lean meat after the skin. i m going back to more salmon. that seems to work the best for me. i also remembered i have a blood keytone glucose reader and i checked my keystones today. it was 1.3  i m definitely in ketosis.  i haven t been snacking at all  but today i ve just not felt full or satisfied. i ate a palm full of pork rinds with a tablespoon of goat cheese and drank some bone broth. i m having grilled salmon and filet mignon with lots of butter for dinner about 3 30 pm. then i ll fast until tomorrow. i hope i m back to losing by then.  did you go through this your first month almost forgot  i checked out your area and it s absolutely stunning!!
@e wood  my first month i intentionally stayed off the scale so i wouldn t get discouraged at all. i don t think i weighed myself for a few months actually. the only thing i ever checked was my measurements and they consistently improved. i learned that from the first time i did the keto diet. i lost 65 pounds total back then but i hit a plateau that lasted months where i wasn t losing any weight but i was still losing inches of fat so when i went carnivore my goal was to lose inches of fat rather than weight. kelly hogan has mentioned multiple times how she gained weight for her first 6 months of carnivore and she was getting discouraged but trusted that things would get better and after 6 months the weight just fell off and she was able to keep it off from that point on. bella the steak and butter gal had the same thing happen to her so don t get discouraged if you gain a little. things will work  i promise. you are on the right track with salmon and butter. make sure you eat enough  sometimes you can actually stall if you re not eating enough. your body will go into a preservation mode if it s not getting enough food so it will hang onto every calorie it can. it seems counterintuitive to eat more to lose weight but it works if you re getting enough fat. i ate a lot of fatty ribeye in the beginning and lost a lot all at once  i was also eating salmon every day too. eggs of course  too. that s good that you re in ketosis  it sounds like you re doing things right. fasting definitely helped me as well. i try to eat intuitively  if my body is feeling hungry i generally listen to it and eat more. where you were feeling hungry you might need to eat a little bit more. it s amazing how different both of our areas look  we re on opposite ends of the country. you re close to the mexican border and i m about a 2 1 2 hour drive from the canadian border.
@dave m  - ha! i didn t even snap about our distances to the north and south borders. i m obsessive compulsive with the scale when i m trying to lose weight! i m up another pound today.  i do feel like i m going to fluctuate and in a few days i ll probably have another big drop. i did increase my fat and food intake  though. i m still not eating past 3-4pm and if i eat 2 meals i m having the first about 10 30 am.  i m taking my keytone reading throughout the day. yesterday was 2.1 and 1.8  so  i know i m in good ketosis. i ve been working and not been active. i m going to start my garden this weekend so  i ll get in some back breaking exercise then. since i m not eating the stuff i grow  i ll probably have a bumper crop.
@e wood  as soon as i stopped eating vegetables my garden started doing fantastic haha. my chickens appreciate the vegetables at least. it can be hard to stop checking the scale when you re dieting  i used to check every day back when i started keto. now i never check anymore. i only occasionally break out the tape measure. i feel really good and fixed a bunch of health issues so it doesn t matter to me anymore. it helps that i m the smallest i ve been since high school.  2.1 and 1.8 are really good readings so i wouldn t worry about the scale right now  good things are going to come with readings like that. when i first started carnivore i got into intermittent fasting after about a month and once i was used to that i did some extended fasts  my longest was 80 hours. i am probably going to do an extended fast soon just because it makes me feel really good. the sweet spot spot for me seems to be 48 hours  after 48 hours of not eating i feel the best and i have tons of energy for some reason.
@e wood  yes  i drink nothing but water when i fast. when i first started extended fasting i would drink bone broth as well. start off slow with the fasting and build up  i was amazed at how easy it was once i was fat adapted though. the first night of the first day i d be hungry so i would eat a tablespoon of salt. it would take the edge off. by the next day i wasn t hungry and i could keep fasting pretty easily from that point on. that s good that you thought about the hawthorn berry. once you drop a little weight your bp should go down. my bp used to be sky high as well  now it s normal.
@dave m  - i feel like i screwed up my progress with the dang hawthorn extract.  it was definitely jacking with me. probably full of sugar. grrr. my keytone test showed 1.3 this morning. thank goodness. i was down .02 on scale. i can t help myself i can also tell i had sugar or something because i didn t get up for two nights in a row to pee. i had to get up twice last night so  maybe i m flushing out that sugar again. i noticed when i first started this  i had to get up to pee a lot. i ve started adding to my garden today too. my back is screaming lol. hopefully i got in some good exercise. i was so hungry afterwards i ate about a cup of seasoned pork and a palm full of pork rinds. that was before 3pm  but i can probably get by with that being my last meal. i ll sip on some tea or bone broth later tonight.
@e wood  yeah that sugar will wreak havoc on your insulin. i was listening to dr. ben bikman today  he teaches undergrads at byu so he explains things in very easy to understand terms. he was saying that high blood pressure is almost always a symptom of being insulin resistant. i know in my case i had high bp for a number of years and many other symptoms of being pre-diabetic. you re definitely on the right track to fixing things  i was able to fix mine. i m glad the scale went in the right direction this time  you have to stay off of that thing haha! that s another thing that has improved with me  the whole getting up to pee multiple times at night. i have bph which was most likely caused by being insulin resistant. i was waking up 3 - 4 times a night sometimes  it was awful. now the most i get up is 1 time and i can sometimes make it through the whole night now.
@dave m  - i m almost 53  and i ve had high bp since my early 30 s. i wasn t overweight then. it runs in my family. everyone has it. i was put on meds at about 33. i quit taking them cold turkey last october. i started taking natural supplements and decided to divorce big pharma. i have told my niece who is approaching 40  to not take bp meds if a doctor tries to prescribe them. it pisses me off that none of them will tell you fish oil will lower triglycerides or magnesium and hawthorn berry will naturally lower bp. i went for a refill for bp meds and my 15 year old dog that was my life was dying of heart disease. i was upset and wanted out of there asap. the  doctor  was telling me i needed anti depressants! i was sooo pissed off. i told her there is a huge difference between being sad and being depressed. i refused all meds offered. after paying  10 400 a year for two bp meds  i said screw this! i have no doubts i m probably pre-diabetic and positive i m insulin resistant. i ve always joked that i m the healthiest eating fat person.  i ve never had to get up more than one time in the night to pee  though. this more frequent urinating started after cutting carbs out. i think it s the water weight and flushing out the toxins.  have you checked your bph since you ve gotten healthy  my step dad suffered for years with high prostate counts and they did so many biopsies for years always missing his cancer. he kept going back over n over and to different doctors because he knew something was wrong. after about 5 years of him insisting something was wrong he finally found a new doctor that not only found his prostate cancer  but it had spread into his lungs. he had the biggest mass the doctor had ever seen. he couldn t believe how many  doctors   missed it.  i have about zero faith in so called medical doctors these days. it s all about pushing big pharma and nothing else. on a happier note  that evil scale that i m obsessed with is finally back down to my 17 pound loss.  however  my keytone reading was 0.6 at 4 30 am.  my last meal was 3pm ish and i only had one cup of chamomile tea at 7pm. i m sure it will increase later today.
@dave m  - i need to keep listening to you lol. my scale has been fluctuating so much  i don t know how accurate it is. i was going to wait until feb 2  to retake measurements  but dreadfully  i broke out the tape this morning  i took my chest  waist  and hips on january 10th. then added arms and thighs january 14. the results are  chest -  1 2  waist- 1-1 2  hips - 2  arms - 1 2  thighs -1   that s in less than 20 days. amazing. i m so happy today.
very true...you cannot get in to see a doctor at all! it s  a nurse practioner and it takes months to get in...i was told many doctors died  retired or took on patients of doctors who died retired.
fellow oregonian here  i was so disgusted trying to establish care and having to wait 8 months to see a pa not even a dr. i have insurance but pay out of pocket a monthly fee to be a member of a direct primary care md.  it was new to me and have been so happy with my care. i have almost hour long appts with my md and can get an appt within a few days if need be.or if i was really sick she also makes house calls. all that to say  direct primary care can be a good option. it s expensive not going through insurance and i don t have a lot of money  but it s worth it to me to stay out of the medical industrial puppy mill. god bless
@morgin hammer  thank you. that s good information. i ll keep it in mind.
i cannot see a gi doc unless i agree to a colonoscopy again  less than 10 years . what a joke.
that plandemic burned us out! -respiratory therapist . icu   floors  nicu... and wear a papr non stop . covid was crazy weird and the way it worked... i could say more but...
hallelujah and congratulations!   you are one smart cookie!!!!   awesome that you did this  god bless you!
i am a a vet.  had an almost complete ac sep from a fall.  guy told me the worst he had seen.  no surgery.  read where 2 out of three fail in a few years and then it is worse.   i was retired so i did not have to actually use the shoulder much.  now - no pain no discomfort and no problems.
out of all of the hospitalizations and medical care that one could have the va has to be the scariest. granted financially some go to them i would put my trust in god and use them as a totally last resort this coming from a nurse of 28 years and having had a father and various friends in the va system with very detrimental outcomes.
good job! we all need to get back to taking care of ourselves. i never understood blindly doing what someone  a doctor  tells you to do  that s just slavery.
@roberta vaughan  absolutely! this navy brat agrees.
how wonderful eric. you are proof that we can help ourselves. bless you.
nice!
good going eric!  i get chiropractic adjustments and then myself - push in other subluxed areas.  then i m ready for sit-ups and light weightlifting!
@kathleen fuller  as pam popper points out  frequent visits to doctors - are not related to longevity!
i did something similar. said a huge no to medical treatment.  used home means. healed quickly and fine  mt injuries quite worse actually.  used comfrey . more people need to learn home care.
@ hed  home health care - until better health care is restored.  12 years ago  when the aca was brought into the u.s. - i learned about how ailments were logged within 110 000 categories and where accountants made the decisions on treatment  not the doctors.  that s also when i learned from kathy helgaslog about health care in iceland.  she said   just give your name once and you get everything you need for free!
also concerning the temperament of the nurses. some people  more   more imm afraid  are abusive to the nurses. i heard of a nurse who was taking care of a patient that had dropped her tv remote. the nurse made the remark   2e are nurses  no waitresses.
@billie preston  yes  part of the entitlement we see that s so prevalent these days. i did not spend over 3 years and many     in college  to say nothing of all the extra studying and training  years of experience   to become or actually stay a waitress  in my high school days . it appalls me to see what has happened to our medical system! where is independent thinking !  depending on where you have to treat someone  you may not be in an institution  with whatever med. supplies you need at your fingertips. what then !  i always said that nurses  like mothers  have to also learn to be a jack of all trades  and a troubleshooter  especially when providing home health care! i worked  in psychiatric and home care for many years. when the plan-demik came along  i withdrew from my beloved choice of living  because i refused to administer a med. to anyone  whose effectiveness  side effects  and reason for ever coming into being  was is highly controversial  let alone take it myself. so i stopped working in nursing. i knew it was  still is  the right choice. i was initially considered an alarmist as well as other things  and my opinions and teachings  we re mostly ignored. now the tables have turned  but too much of the damage has already been done. i have lost loved ones  both in my family and outside of it. it breaks my heart. for so many that have let themselves be a guinea pig  essentially  they are having medical and psychiatric issues that no one can find a basis for  other than the obvious. why are young athletes dropping of heart failure  those people should ve lasted well into their 80s or 90s  and enjoyed a long  full life. there are so many things that are caused by     and they are left to try and figure out what to do  if they are still alive. i could go on for hours  but please  listen to people that should know what is going on in this current scenario  who have no  skin in the game   who stand to not make unlimited funds from this whole thing. learn as much as you can  be prepared  because you certainly can t depend on the old medical system that you used to. self education is the best thing you can do  and listen to people that know what they re talking about  like the patriot nurse. she and i are products of different generations of medical nursing care paradigms. we truly care about the people  not about the money. and thank the people that are brave enough to speak out.
that is wonderful   i love this.
excellent! good work!
we learned to late.  the va took my husband s life six years ago.  had confirmation from st john s  osu  and ou....on purpose.    i learned.  i know have no doctor....won t go.   off all meds except one allergy pill a day and occasionally a inhaler.    working on weight loss  etc.   no more.   no more.   last time you had to go to er....nurse gave me an injection....i asked what it was  she told me it didn t matter  i needed do to allergy attack.  burned like madness.   two years later still have a funny bump rash there.   found out it s parasitic.   now treating.     had no clue....my doctor didn t know.   didn t know about psoriatic angioma either.   didn t know about radiation poisoning either.  treated myself.
@ml gusman  reducing dairy  especially milk  helps with allergies.
@roberta vaughan  god has healed me   trust in the lord are god

wow
@ben lagging  i am going through the same thing right now fell on my shoulder   didn t go to my dr and have test but went to my chiropractor he has therapy in his clinic  it s been to months and still can t raise my arm good and still in pain how long did it take you to get over this and are you completely healed.thanks!
@livi lou  that shoulder has never given me problems after recovery.  it took almost four months before i could move it at all.  i also broke that same shoulder last sept.  have to sleep on my other side now.  the side i sleep on gives me pain every day lol.  ac and broke should seldom give me pain and i never did have it repaired for the ac sep.  the broken should blade can not be set and it did stiffen up some after that one.  had to do some shifting with jobs for mt right hand over to my left.  hard to reach certain spots for cleaning.   -   hope yours gets better!
that s what i did. went back to school to study microbiology  anatomy  etc.
that s awful. i am a nurse and as you named off those symptoms i knew it had to be appendicitis. i would have been standing on that phone calling the dr. and wouldn t have taken no for an answer. you really have to pray you get a sharp nurse who takes her responsibilities seriously.
i swear  this is why i m glad my kids are grown. if i had been in that situation with my kids at a younger age...well...i would try like hell to convince myself they re not worth the prison sentence i would get for putting one through the ear of those pos nurses. imho  far too many so-called medical professionals have become low-life  money-grubbing snakes who give a bad name to the good ones. pn is spot-on!
praise yhvh!
she went to the er with severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting and they missed appendicitis  that is very curious. no ct
sounds like sac..
my beloved was in a er waiting room with an aortic aneurysm for 5 or 6 hours because his ekg looked good to the screening nurse. he s ok now praise be to god.
thankfully  there are still many good people in healthcare  though most of them are gullible  here in mo because christianity is still a thing here. the ones in the big cities... not so much.
omg.  i have a similar story with my adult son. we are refusing to pay the first er bill.
i remember being on duty approximately 12 years ago and this happened to a coworker of ours almost died standing my ground i finally had to tell the surgeon that wanted to wait until the next day to run more tests on my coworker nurse that i m calling another surgeon immediately and did he was willing to be there immediately. that got first surgeon there and guess what  ruptured appendix. never second guess your gut feeling ever
jonica s kitchen--that is a horrible story and i m glad your girl is ok. we do have the right to have a friend or family member present as our advocate when in hospital. i would contact the hospital s patient advocate department and threaten follow through with legal action  as your adult daughter s rights were violated. she would have to do it  since she s an adult  but it may be worth it to make them change their awful ways and compensate her for their medical abuse.
yes! many ppl are hoping to see some private hospitals popping up.   we d all go support you.
sounds like one in a smaller state on the west coast where i worked 30 years ago  rn   for only a few weeks  and quit when my supervisor told me to lie on my paperwork so they could continue receiving the funding for this one particular patient.  i said i wasn t lying for anyone and walked out!   she chuckled.  about 15 years later  i ran into that person and she had become a nurse practitioner.  a very poor one  indeed -- did not understand the medications that she was prescribing  etc.  that hospital has always had a bad reputation  many patients have died there because of negligence and malpractice.  i ve heard many horror stories from various individuals who were either a patient there or lost a loved one there.  sounds like it could be the same one.
@patriot pam  i am not in medical industry and reconized the signs.
maybe you and the kids could start a site that reviews hospitals and er s so we can check them.
my son  who is 42  went to the er two years ago with severe abdominal pains. he called an ambulance. this was in la. they left in laying him that ambulance the parking lot for 3 days!! told him they would not admit him because he was only there for drugs. finally after three days they gave in because they realized he was not going to leave and admitted him only to find out his appendix had ruptured. then they put him on iv antibiotics and put a draining tube in him to drain out the infection. he was released like three days later. i don t even know how he is still alive to be honest with you. sigh.
don t ever leave your children i don t care how old they are! i did and they killed my son!
you definitely have to watch out for your own.
wow. appendicitis eval is almost a no brainer. that structure can also be saved and healed w early treatment  but not medical they wouldn t know or been taught how .  we desperately need education on home care   vital signs  administration of self nursing.
they violated her patient rights.  esp since she was a minor.
i really like the smaller hospitals compared to the larger ones. even though the nurses are busy  they were very kind.
yikes! glad your daughter was okay. although my appendix wasn t the problem  in the fall of 2008    i had just started the semester when one period cycle  i couldn t seem to keep anything down and on day 3 or 4  my belly was swollen and i couldn t keep anything down. my mom took me to the nearest er  dad at the time wasn t sure if it was that serious at the time  and we discovered that my cecum had turned 360   blocking everything! luckily  i had good staff and my cecum and appendix was removed from my body.  while in recovery  i learned that my cecum began to have surface tares and had we waited another day or two  it would have burst out. i am so grateful i was still living with my parents and that my mom followed her instincts!
@joyce chapman  i am so sorry about your son   how they treated him but know all to well what this feels like. it s uncalled for   unnecessary.  i am from the same state   had trauma surgery at one of our major capital area hospitals. terrible experience! they didn t want to adequately treat my pain  bone trauma  and pumped me full of nsaids for 3  of the 6 days i was there. i confided in another surgeon and he said they could have killed me. i had 4 huge drains   the day i refused the nsaids they were finally able to remove 1 4 drains. it s a long story but as sad as things are  i m glad people are waking up. some leaving the country for procedures. this is how bad it s gotten in the states.
@fallacy as praxis  32 years ago they missed appendicitis with my then 14 year old daughter who had worsening pain that traveled from her umbilicus to her lower right abdomen  nausea and vomiting.  fever that shot up from 101.2 to 104 and a blood pressure dropping down to 70 30.  the er docs were speculating that she either had a torsed ovary or an ectopic pregnancy.  after they put in a foley they were thinking about whether to put in an ng tube. all this time  no tests  no cat scan or sonography to aid them in their diagnosis and i told them appendicitis!! her appendix is bursting!  she needs surgery.  then they told me that well  surgery is a risk.  i replied  if she doesnt have surgery at this point she will die!!!!  let s go!! this is malpractice long story short  i must have said the magic m word because they did wind up taking her into surgery  and sure as shooting she had a ruptured appendix because of all the clowning around  procrastination and stalling.  she came through the surgery ok  but spent the next 4 days in pedi icu because of the peritonitis.  and to think that this happened back in the day before things got really bad.......
@fallacy as praxis  i m not surprised. my daughter was in and out of the er for three years  ages 3-6  with severe abdominal pain. every single person we saw in the er wanted to chalk up to constipation and send her home with miralax even with me telling them that she ate a whole foods diet and consumed plenty of fiber. finally  one np asked if she d ever had a gallbladder function test. boom. her gallbladder was essentially non-functional  less than 3   and causing gastroparesis. she went through three years of hell because the  professionals  just wanted to check another patient off their lists and chalk the pain up to her being a whiny kid who ate too many happy meals. when we finally got to the root of the problem  jaws dropped and doctors started asking  how has she functioned for the past three years  gallbladder pain is excruciating!
i very much struggle with the issues you discussed in this video. i have lost virtually all confidence in the medical establishment.i had a great relationship with a family practitioner for over 20 years. that relationship was destroyed during the pandemic. it became very clear to me that he was not thinking critically or listening to my valid concerns.i am now in the process of searching for a new general practitioner family doctor. the process has been slow and relatively unsuccessful. it seems that most of the medical establishment has foregone whatever understanding of science they may have had. it is truly sad and disheartening.the ongoing promotion of the poisonous vaccines and advocacy for wearing masks only serves to further exacerbate the issue. what i need is a resource that will direct me to medical practitioners who were not duped.i want to trust my doctor again  but i don t believe i m ever going to have that sort of relationship with my caregivers again.
i had a major surgery during covid. couldn t have any visitors the entire week i was there. i never saw my doctor again after he cut me open. most of the nurses were cold. it was a nightmare. i am still dealing with the trauma. god is good and is providing healing over time.
my husband works in healthcare. patriot nurse speaks the absolute truth.
i went to the hospital last year and i swear  i thought i needed a representative to fight for me while i lay there incapacitated and unable to defend myself while on drugs and in pain. it was the absolutely awful attitude of non-human behavior of most of the doctors surgeons mostly that made my already trying stay there even tougher. good thing i m like an old saddle bag. i walked out of there even though they almost made that impossible! god bless you  patriot nurse. you are awesome.
spot on!  i retired last year out of frustration after 25 years in healthcare as an x-ray  ct tech.  the healthcare system is a mess.
i sure appreciate your update.  i  too am an rn that took early retirement several years before the  c  hit to take care of my elderly sick father.  i knew things were changing in the field but never thought it would change this fast.  i know after watching several yt channels that the quality of care is severely lacking but it is more like the patients are on autopilot.  i thank god everyday that i am experienced and trained to be able to make the necessary decisions for my family in this day of no care in site.
i learned that if i have a family member in the hospital  that i need to stay with them as.much as possible. if i hadn t  my mom would have passed away. they were so short staffed  the nurses couldn t keep up. and since mom was not jabbed  she was quarantined at the end of a hall. pretty much ignored. disgusting
i went to my np appt last month and was told by the receptionist to put on a mask. i said   as an rn  i m going to need a rationale to go with that demand.  she said  it s office policy  if you want to be seen  you have to wear one.  i said   i am not going to be told what to wear or not wear  and i cannot trust a clinic that places politics before rational  scientific patient care  so i guess you aren t my provider anymore.  i walked out. i sent an email to the clinic regarding the same. a few days later i got a bill for my  missed  appt. do you think i paid it
the reason i quit nursing in 2017 is because the state government would not let hospitals restrain violent patients anymore. even holding a patient s arm or leg during an injection was considered a restraint. we were taught that if we were ever attacked we were supposed to just run away. i became more afraid of being fired or sued for defending myself more than actually being battered. the final straw is when a patient slugged me and i held up my fists in a defensive position and was told by management that it is against policy to hold up clenched fists and that i should have shown my palms because it is more passive. that s when i retired from nursing.
i appreciate your videos very much. a good friend of mine was a nurse for 26 years here in south central north carolina  and finally quit  not because she wanted to retire  but because she saw the handwriting on the wall just as you have described. i think you want for sound advice and we  do well to heed it. the globalist factions in our government really do not care about the general population  that is very clear. i m old enough to remember when doctors made house calls and we are in a far different country than the one i grew up in. thanks again  take care and keep up the good work.
i work in a metro hospital in mn.  even tho my hospital got huge wage hikes approved this month  more nurses are still leaving. we are burnt out. we are taking care of many more patients with fewer staff.  b4 covid  a busy day in our er was 45 patients at a peak in the evening.  this week we saw over 90 at its peak one evening.  more  and more  and more. we have fewer kitchen staff  fewer housekeeping  fewer lab techs  fewer doctors  etc.  we are constantly running out of items and getting substandard replacements. this is a snowball going down a hill.  i don t think i can continue to  do this much longer. it is truly awful.
i was lucky. i graduated in 1969 and had a 50 yr career in nursing. this woman is correct in her assessment of the current healthcare debacle. you may remember a time when churches started hospitals and schools of nursing as a ministry to the suffering. those days ended with the beginning of the insurance industry s takeover of a lucrative business model.   i tell people now to avoid hospitals if at all possible. get and stay healthy. learn how to take care of yourself and loved ones. look for or look into forming groups to provide care  perhaps within your church. the place we call hospital started in france   hotel dieu -house of god. we can make them so again by disrupting the insurance industry.
i m in canada  and i had to take my daughter to the er on boxing day  as there were no walk-in clinics open. while we were in a curtained cubicle waiting for the doctor  they brought in a lady in to the next cubicle. i listened in on the situation  no privacy or confidentiality at all  and this lady came in with a toothache. she was also diabetic and when they tested her blood sugar  it was off the charts! she hadn t eaten in 25 hours due to her toothache  and hadn t taken any insulin or medication  that she was supposed to take with a meal . so  now they had to treat her for her diabetes. the nurses were good  but it just goes to show how lazy people are when it comes to their health. apparently  this lady had been in before and i heard the nurses say that she was a nightmare. our socialized medicine system in canada is a joke and people like this treat it like a merry-go-round.
it s virtually impossible to see a doctor today in my area of california.  pas are all you will ever see.  no matter how serious your issues.they don t read your records.  they require new lab tests and when you go back in for follow up on labs  they assign someone new and you are back at square one with someone that doesn t know you or care.it s all about the profit.
spot on! i ve been a nurse for 20 years and i m disgusted with the politicization of medicine. i left nursing. i won t bow down to the covid lies. i loved taking care of patients. it s unfortunate. i have about 20 good years left to work but i can not work in  healthcare  as it is now.
i have definitely felt like my healthcare  has become very robotic in the last few years  even prior to the pandemic. i want to find a good doctor who will listen and work with me based on my families medical history but i ve been shrugged off because i m not old enough to worry about those things.   it s so sad  but i m educating myself  as much as possible.
relative of mine went into the hospital in january for breathing problems. the hospital was a ghost town  but nevertheless instituted covid visitation policy and would not let his daughter in. they wouldn t even let his wife in until he had a covid test  which came back negative. she told them absolutely no ventilator  no remdesivir  and he concurred when they asked him. she was finally allowed in to see him. turned out he had pneumonia and sepsis. they said they had to keep him in er overnight because they had no beds.  keep in mind this place was a ghost town  empty-feeling  and with many areas roped off .  the next day was a sunday and they moved him to intensive care and allowed his wife in to see him. within a few minutes  a nurse came in and said it had been decided to treat him as if he was covid-positive even though he wasn t  and told her she had to leave. she refused. she sat there waiting for someone to come in and throw her out  possibly call the police on her. of course  it was a sunday and she couldn t contact an attorney  though she planned to the next day. she was terrified they would kill him during the night. no one came to throw her out  thankfully. she secretly treated him with hydrogen peroxide sprayed on the back of his throat and giving him zinc and vit. d. the next day  he was released. the doctor said she had never seen someone recover so quickly from pneumonia and sepsis.  his wife believes it was the quick action of ems  ambulance  that night that saved his life  along with iv antibiotics administered later. i believe that as well  but also her vigilance that prevented them from instituting the deadly covid protocol  isolate  sedate  ventilate  and remdesivir for the kill. i won t go to a hospital now unless there is absolutely no other option.
this is timely....my mom is a now retired ccrn. she had been on blood pressure meds for years but almost immediately after she stopped working she didn t need them. she said she was glad she was getting out  2016  that too many people were treating nursing as a business and losing empathy. her words.my cousin just switched healthcare systems this week. she had gone through the c0vid mand@tes unj@bbed and she was disgusted with how her previous health system wasn t treating patients with c0vid meds but allowed them to be put on a vent and d!e.also this week  i am having to explain why i don t have a local doctor any longer after moving out of state in 2020. we haven t been sick enough to warrant going to services  yet they wonder why i haven t brought my 10   7 yr old to any well child visits....you explained perfectly well why.i missed listening  i hope you continue on an upward path with your health and look forward to upcoming videos in the new year. i m awaiting the new schedule  i d be interested to see if a class comes to michigan. much love!
my mom was a nurse who decided to retire early last year after years of deteriorating working conditions  and covid was the last straw. her health has gotten better since finally deciding to leave.
as a transplant patient  2 livers   i am so happy i had mine in 17-18. they wouldn t give me one now bc i won t take the vaccine if i needed it. my hepatologist whom i have had since 2003  she s like family  but i asked her very firmly if i would need to get another doctor  because she isn t going to bully me. i get the final say. she stood down and said no no no  we don t have to talk about it again. i refuse to get another flu vaccine and i won t be taking a pneumonia vaccine anymore. they have already said this is  non compliance.  funny how that works. i am terrified of going back in the hospital.
me too during covid  was so eye opening we made major changes  moved too. disgraceful and demonic ppl running the show. most are complicit with the madness.
hang in there. take good care of yourself.
i doubt absolute truth. for example i d wager he calls july 4 a holiday  lying. only god can declare a holy day. all others are vanity  it is written  false. there are 7 holy days. we lie constantly to one another  evil hearts continuously.
@gameliel auceps  a holiday is not a holy day...holi     ho li     also known as the festival of colors  the festival of spring  and the festival of love  is an ancient hindu religious festival and one of the most popular festivals in hinduism. it celebrates the eternal and divine love of radha krishna. the day also signifies the triumph of good over evil.holi-day is a festival day  not a holy day.
i was in the medical field for just under 30 yrs. even back in the 80 s and 90 s it was pretty bad. it has gotten so much worse.    yes  i am an old fart....... 71
same
its like living on a inhospitable alien planet these days. who would have thought it would come to this.
@derek tomlinson  the old prophets in the bible...
@ghosty426  i never had a flu shot. i will never take that clot shot. my dr.  just like yours  tried to get me to take that damn thing. i wish i could find a dr. who would tell me never to get that shot and eat lots of eggs.
@rick adams  they are still out there. find a provider with a private wellness clinic that does not take insurance.
best way to be your own doctor   1. drink a lot of water  eat a lot of veggies  enough meat proteins and somehow get enough omega 3  and zinc in your system.   2. do exercise at least 1 hour everyday.  3. stack on anti-biotics  the only medications that can actually cure illnesses  4. get some high end med kits  5. stop smoking  6. stop smoking  7. did i mention to stop smoking...    8. wash your hands often  9. brush your teeth  10. drink some more water...
@rick adams  you are not old  you are a seasoned person with wisdom to share.  but will they listen   i for one would like to hear what you are seeing.
@gameliel auceps  what are you talking about
@gameliel auceps  truth and healing are the keys!
@derek tomlinson  like 1930s germany!
@gameliel auceps  maybe look up npc  and what it means.
@derp  since health care is being run by monied interests - like health care   insurance companies - even curative care is being strung out for everything these market interests can get.  the large banks which own or invest in this process then speculate on these assets - while government officials allow this racket to go on!
@rick adams  must be a bigger influence by big money and the standard of care ethics that they shape.  a 1933 bankruptcy reorganization is needed - so the real economy gets the credit needed  at the expense of the usurious gouging by the large banks!
yes  they teach us how to defend ourselves by not causing harm to our patients.  so let them beat the crap out of us  but we should not instinctively react and harm a hair on their body.
i got basically the same training for sped teaching. i got mocked for speaking out about administrative neglect when students or patients harm teachers and nurses.  that s part of your job!  i m an slp  so i straddle the healthcare and educational worlds. there is so much in common. teachers are leaving the profession in the same way pn described the flight from nursing.
same with teaching. a 5yr old killed a teacher not that long ago because it s illegal to restrain kids  even if they are abusive.
painful to hear this.
over the last years ive been horribly neglected  given contraindicated meds  im disabled and my last ever stay in november id been left in the corridor with no assist to toilet i tried to walk there by holding the wall but i started to faint and hit my eye on the corner of the the nurses station - still no assistance - hours later i had to use bathroom again - i asked for help and the nurse spread her arms out and said  nobody help her- i watched her walk earlier she doesn t need help  she was furious and repeated it. i thought i was over the trauma of sexual assault by a ob gyn in 2013 but i was terrified that night and day - i am alone anyone going to hospital needs an advocate now and an assertive one at that.  ive chosen a dnr  do not resuscitate
i never feared anything while taking excellent care of patients. what did it for me  was in 2015  after the institution of ohbalmakare  was my total exhaustion panic attack burnt out with the rising number of patients that was so unsafe  in our step down icu unit that meant 5 6  and 7 1 ration! tele tech to justify giving us more patients..i had people bleeding out  post-cardiac cath  drug overdoses  elderly eloping.....scary! i was having nightmares my patients were dying and i couldn t get their faces out of my nightmares at night. they were become day terrors. i was told by management  there s the door! ... you just have different...work ethic  when i was reporting crimes against patients....the list goes on. i will practice my science with conscience. now  i m a patient. disabled. and crushed in many way  i m working through and on.
@jennifer  after i had been assaulted the hospital did not want me to press charges  but i did anyway and he got 3 years in prison.  your right about tele units. i worked in icu  but floated to telemetry and thought that some of the patients should still be in the icu.
hospitals must follow cms guidelines for reimbursement. what that really means is  under the cms condition of participation for patient rights  the nurse is a punching bag.
demoralizing and stressing healthcare professionals helps to purge the good employees and replace them with immoral  ignorant and mentally unstable people.
4 of our er staff were being verbally sexually assaulted  spat on  and kicked by a male patient- because of the rule of no aggressive use or restraint towards the patient  the female staff called the police and pressed charges on this patient.  it was frowned upon but legally  the staff had the right to have the patient charged and arrested for his abuse- he was not drunk or high- he had been in a fight and the police brought him in then left on another call  small  rural farm ranch community .  the patient went to jail  had no one to bail him out  ended up doing 90 days in the local jail for physical assault  threatening first responders and verbal harassment.  once all bedside staff heard this  we all agreed this is how we protect ourselves  from that point on.  i will say  this is not an admin position  this is a federal position our admin must follow to a  t   and  in some ways  they were doing this before the fed mandates so the organization wouldn t be sued  regardless of staff injuries  workmen s comp crappola .
@jkp62  when a patient would become verbally abusive to a female staff i would step in and tell them  you don t talk to her like that!  most of the time the patient would back down  but it was when a patient was threatening to hit a young female cna and i stepped in is when i got slugged. a nurse manager told me that everyone appreciates how i am protective of the female staff  but a doctor  naturally a psychiatrist  told me that i am too  old school.  i guess the new school is that medical staff are supposed to be punching bags. as i wrote in another comment that the hospital didn t want me to press charges  but i did anyway and he got 3 years in prison.
did you report the assault to police   you don t lose your rights just because the assaulter is a patient in a hospital.
@terry kelly the unit manager called the police and he was arrested. i prosecuted him and to my surprise he received 3 years in prison.
@edward white  thanks for your response. i am glad the assaulter was arrested and charged.
well  it sounds like you were more worried about what was going on in the next cubicle that your own daughter. it must be hell living next door to you.
@starlite556  my daughter was fine...she was napping while we waited for an hour for the doc to come.
same in michigan!!
@hycoperosity  me  too!  tennessee
me too!
you got it!  same reasons why i left as well.
start your own business and provide supportive care to those who need a good and true nursing skills. provide your expertise outside the system.
@teresa levell  have to do this at the friend family level for  free  or the state board of_____ fill in the blank-- medicine  nursing  pt  ect...  will charge one with practicing x without a license...and one really should not advertise such so they can fly under the radar......                                             that said...   great idea!!!
i retired after 10 years in nursing.  even as an adon  i could not effect change at our facility.  oh  upper management  listened  to me advocate for our patients and  listened  to my concerns about how we were always so short-staffed  the inept and unqualified staff they were hiring  and how unsafe things were  but  in the end  it always came down to money.  they simply patronized me.  i got tired of it.  i refused to work in a broken system  so i retired in october.  i haven t missed it all.  i just pray i never have to be hospitalized.  it is a scary place now.
i m in the same boat!  after 27 years of nursing  what now
stay strong we may need you soon
financialization and politicization!
@teresa levell  somewhat the way peter breggin and howard glasser do in mental health.  how complicated is it to enlist people into training an aesthetic cathexis - which is what mental health is!
try private duty if you can.  there are a lot of that need help in their homes.   i now take care of people as a care!aide and they are so grateful!!  it s way more rewarding.
that is outrageous  i m horrified!!!!!   thank god he survived and you stayed with him!
this is so true. i ve been a nurse since 1989. i have never seen such absolutely no empathy for people from the  new nurses  coming out of college now. they have no experience  no sympathy and no clue how to take care of patients. we are living in a different world and it s scary. pray for our country.
as someone who suffers from multiple serious chronic illnesses  i can say this is completely accurate. i ve seen it first hand and for me  it is terrifying.
i m an rn  bsn retired  thank god. i do homeopathic medicine for myself and my family for everything for treating the common cold  to malaria  typhoid or an  intestinal infection. i m living as as expat abroad now and i feel fortunate to not have to witness the decline of of a profession so dear to my heart.
i was at a doctors appointment and the door opened and a nurse called a gentleman back. he stood up and swayed a little and then collapsed to his knees. all 6 of us in the waiting room jumped up and rushed to his side  the nurse just stood at the door and said nothing. it took a few minutes and another patient gave him his walker so he could get into a room. the nurse continued to just stand at the door and didn t say a word or a do a thing. once he was gone we all looked at each other and were like wtf!
you are spot on. our families realize there is substandard health care at this time. if we need medical care it s in god s hands. now  wait until this deconstruction hits the utility companies.
it s not just the healthcare industry...this country has become dysfunctional in about every endeavor you can think of .. not much works anymore  nor do most of the younger workers  care.. the most frightening thing i can think of is having to get in  involved with the healthcare industry...
i left healthcare in 2017 after 25 years of emergency and critical care work.  my wife  rn with 20  years experience  and a friend who is a dr just walked away from corporate healthcare and started a direct primary care clinic and a unique care model of transformational care. meaning they have a team of themselves  behavioral health  physical therapy and a local crossfit gym working as a team to take people with chronic diseases  hypertension  type two diabetes    chronic inflammatory disease  ect  and run them through a 12 week program to change their habits and behavior and teach them to live healthy and get off of many meds  and reduce their dependence on a broken system.
i retired early this year after 30 years as an rn.  my employer mandated the jab  even though i was a remote worker. i was initially threaten with termination.  i decided retirement looked good and i immediately quit.  my license will expire in  a few weeks and i have no plans to renew it. i currently have no health insurance  as i can not afford it.  i have paid cash for the little medical care  i have received this year.
excellent video. we are older than yourself  both of us raised at a time when you were required to critically think. there was no ambulance service  only one doctor in the area dr. celestino. we leaned how to do things on our own. when mumps  measles  or chicken pox went around and one of us caught it  my mom would say  great  gather all the children and lets get this over with  we have seen the system change and then change again. thanks for all you shared  i think it was rather brave of you.
i live in illinois  and i m experiencing this first hand. it really is every bit as bad as you ve described  and it s steadily getting worse. my mother is only 68 years old. she has chrons disease and colon cancer and was admitted to the hospital two months ago with renal failure after undergoing three separate chemo sessions and becoming severely dehydrated  during which she had been on a mostly liquid diet. prior to this  she had undergone a re-section  which was supposed to have removed the cancerous area of her colon. nevertheless  she was pressured into doing chemo for at least six months  and despite my warnings  chose to do as they recommended. she was walking on her own  and drove herself to the hospital when she was admitted for renal failure. she was given iv fluids  to restore kidney function  but after three weeks of being in severe pain that was only getting worse  they had still failed to properly diagnose her condition. during the third week  she had a scan that revealed a perforation in her intestine  along with a severe flare up of chrons brought on by the chemo. i was at work when i got the call that she was being rushed into surgery to repair the damage  so i went to the hospital and waited for five hours while they operated on her. the damage was so bad that the surgeon performed an ileostomy after a large section of the perforated intestine was removed. after this surgery  she was so severely weakened that she was unable to sit up in bed  lift her legs  or stand on her own two feet. after less than a week with zero improvement  we were pressured by the case worker who was negotiating with her insurance company to allow her to be discharged into a care facility. said facility had a five-star medicare rating and was supposed to provide wound care  a wound vac  24-hour care  and daily physical therapy to restore her movement. not only was the facility staff  totally inept at meeting her needs  but  and this came directly from the surgeon who performed the ileostomy  she was so neglected at this facility that she developed a wound infection  and became so severely malnourished that she could no longer be moved without maximum assistance  and a lift to get her out of the bed and into a chair. during her short stay  she had lost more than forty pounds  and looked like a skeleton.the surgeon  who at this point is the only one i even remotely trust  had her immediately removed from their care  and re-admitted to the hospital  put on a wound vac  and given iv antibiotics to treat the infection. he was so furious with the care facility that he was willing to initiate a formal complaint on our behalf  and now i m in the middle of suing them. out of the entire team of doctors we ve dealt with  he s the only one who has shown any real concern for her  not just as a patient  but as a human being. the others have been unhelpful and inept at best  and one of them has outright lied to her on several occasions.it has been over a week now that she s been back in the hospital  and already  they are pressuring me to put her in another care facility  because they want to discharge her as soon as possible. i refused  and insisted that she not be discharged until the infection has been cured  and she is in perfectly stable condition. i had to argue with the insurance company just to make sure they don t discharge her too quickly. i refused to put her in another care facility  and insisted that when she is ready to be discharged  she comes home  where fortunately  i m able to take time off work to take care of her and hire someone to take care of her when i can t be there. i was able to arrange for wound care and physical therapy at home  and was encouraged to do so by the surgeon  who flat out admitted that the longer she remains in any facility  the worse she will get. they are still pushing for her to be discharged this weekend  and the surgeon is the only one who has stepped in to make sure they don t. this whole situation has made it clear to me that i m better off arranging for care in the home than dealing with hospitals  and insurance is little more than a scam that enriches the medical complex.our healthcare system is severely broken  and government intervention is only making it worse.
i m a nurse since 1993 and you are exactly right.  it s really gone downhill and it s sad.  i m not sure how much longer i am going to stay in the field but i m trying to hang in there because i worry about the patients.
the hospital i worked for in the past two years went from every nurse being an rn to now the majority being lpns. the hospital system is encouraging experienced nurses and support staff to leave so they can hire new hires and pay them less.  i was told that the new staff is very fragile.  one told the boss she needed several days notice if she was going to have to work on a different floor.  if she came in and wasn t told she would just leave.
those days are gone   amen! we two old retired army nurses have been aghast at the demise of the healthcare industry. our motto to family and friends  don t get sick!
this dear lady is going to age very gracefully because she takes such good care of herself and others.
wow some of you guy s stories make me feel grateful that i ve not had to go to the hospital but a couple times in my life knock on wood  to this point .  i d agree that small-town doctors are more likely to give you better care than many of the larger hospital chains in our county.       not to mention medical care costs keep going up.
the obamacare started the decline i feel  lost my insurance so many times because of it  spent so much money  it s getting nuts.  i m a chronic pain patient  i had a great doctor  he left and the folks that took his practice over act like they can t be bothered by anything.i m so tired of it.thankfully my mom is getting good care  she s in for the c  but that said they are still short staffed at this hospital.
thank you for articulating this so well! these people grew up in daycare ripped from their mamas by their mamas. they know nothing of love and sacrifice.
i ve had a couple of friends critically ill in hospitals this entire past year....  there has been gross  criminal withholding of certain medical treatments that you know should   would hardly ever happen in the past before this. i m talking about blatant withholding of treatment. i told my friends to get ready to sue for their sake   for the sake of patients who are forced to follow after them.
this is true...and in veterinary medicine too. i see this type of non caring attitude everywhere...not just in healthcare. like in the bible...we are living in the end times!
patriot nurse  i m a psychiatric np in oregon  full autonomy and prescriptive authority here  and agree with everything that you have said. at least for outpatient healthcare  i urge everyone to go to the smallest practice clinic that you can find. think of it like this-- when seeing a provider  ask yourself how many pairs of eyes you think might be looking over that provider s shoulder  management  hr  other nosey providers  etc. . if you can think of more than maybe 1-2  go somewhere else.smaller practices don t have the busybody hr nkvd agents and therefore your provider will be able to prescribe what is actually appropriate without fear of retaliation in the workplace.
its evil and orchestrated
i have noticed the same thing within the past few years
@proverbs 3 5-6  yes  it s in the bible  revelation or matthew 24  that during the end times  people s hearts will grow cold.
@truth seeker    all of this is in the bible. we are in the last days. all four horses are riding. the only answer to this horror is for everything to be destroyed by god and redone in the correct manner by the remnant.
all looking at their phones
@christine pound  yes!
the coldness is a two way street. the patients and their families are relentless and heartless. you can bend over backwards for them and do 99 things out of 100 and they ll complain about the one trivial thing you missed. they give me compassion fatigue quick. also  mee-maw with advanced dementia  cancer  incontinent  needs a heart valve replaced  diabetes .but they know how to wear that call light out that is what we re seeing.   crappy patients  crappy coworkers that are woke sometimes i hope the worst for them all. i used to not see how someone pull believe in slavery but these people do and they would love to enslave others for convenience and for revenge for disagreeing with them. these old farts called  the greatest generation  man that vexes my soul. these old folks will treat you like crap. their generation ain t the greatest in my book.
@john doe  i mostly agree  but i have to say that  the greatest generation  is  by and far  now gone. that generation fought for our freedoms in wwii. most were born in the first two decades of the 20th century  and are mostly gone. my father was one of them. he was born in 1925 and passed from this life in 1995. he served our country honorably from wwii through vietnam in the us navy -pacific fleet. 22 years active duty  and 8 years fleet reserve. i believe you are conflating my father s generation with  my  generation  which i and my wife  of 44  years  vigorously disavow  known as the  baby boomers . the  only  reason we  both born in the later half of the 1950s  were part of the  baby boomers  was that the aarp decided that they didn t have enough  warm bodies  to wield the political clout they now enjoy  and included multiple generations in the so-called  baby boom  post-wwii.
@sonya rhoads   and let s not forget the tictoc dancers  while our hospitals were supposedly overwhelmed sigh
@christine pound  indeed!  mens hearts will fail them for seeing what is coming upon the earth!
@john doe  it sucks when they are demanding i never tried to be rude the nurses at some were nice and worked really hard and some didn t it really depends on the hospital now i would not go until im dead
i went to my regular primary doc yearly . i broke down and cried over my issues. there was no compassion!
scary
i once had a family member collapse in front of me as he was berating us for not forcing his brother into rehab. we tried to explain the situation to him and he wouldn t have it. he obviously was drinking too. he actually tripped and fell to the ground and as i tried to help him he said  don t touch me bitch!  who was the one that needed the rehab
that is wonderful!
wow i love this
incredible i love it!
how hard would you say it was for your wife and her colleague to walk away and start their own practice  i am praying this becomes more common.
@k cann  it took about a year of planning  basically working 2 jobs  and looong weeks.   about 6 months of capital set aside to cover expenses  but they are on track to hit their break even patient load within 4 months of going full time.     in the end it really wasn t as much of a sacrifice as say starting most other businesses as the demand for affordable healthcare is huge.   once you remove the insurance companies out of the loop healthcare becomes much less expensive.i can t post links here but if you google true north dpc hamilton montana you can read about their model.
that sounds wonderful  wish there was something like that in my area. you both are doing a wonderful service for people.
god bless you!
how much of a kickback do general practice doctors get from drug companies for ... hypertension meds  diabetes pills  pain management pills and other psychotropic drugs
where is this
@maura demarco  montana.
@ghosty426  honestly i m not sure.   i have seen some get free food  and a trip or 2 for  education  . ie a class on hypertension done on a caribbean cruise.   if there is actual money changing hands i haven t seen it.
well done! this is how  we the people  can take care of ourselves!
@robert hansen  i think they had many seminars at the hyatt regency grand cypress in lake bueno vista fl. back in the late 80s and 90s when it was a 5 star  5 diamond hotel..  nothing but the best and it was close by wally world and sea world too...https   youtube.com shorts bxwb0csw1jw feature share
@robert hansen  i d love to visit montana... beautiful country and cutting edge patriots with survival skills. dave paulides hales from montana anymore and he just put out a new movie about all the folks who go missing in national parks and forrests.   missing 411 the alien connection    he already has 2 movies out about missing people. they are free on youtube.   don t go camping or hiking in the deep woods without  seeing these movies. his books are very informative too.
i retired from nursing two months ago.  i think your wife and doc friend are on to something!
@ghosty426  david p lives about 3 hours from me.  i have watched his movies and listen to his weekly videos.  very interesting stuff.     my dad was a park ranger and i grew up living in park housing around the west.   i ve spent my whole life in the woods  a lot of it alone.   i have had some wild and weird experiences out there for sure.   it s just stuff that you have to see for yourself.
@robert hansen  thank you for sharing that with me. i m from william penn s nape of the woods. i ve  enjoyed the woods around harvey s lake pa since my childhood.   i didn t have any strange things happen to me hunting 30  years ago.  i have a desire to go out west now and see those beautiful areas.
@robert hansen that is amazing. sounds like a wonderful program.
i recommend watching doctor robert morse  an amazing human.
what is his address
@carole coyote  1313 mockingbird lane...tell em grandpa sent you...
would you be willing to disclose your location  we need you   what you are doing!
@ghosty426  in normal medical practice  there is no direct reimbursement. this means that the majority of doctors are not getting anything for prescribing the newest and most expensive medicines. a number of docs do a lot of speaking  so that is a way to compensate those who prescribe a lot of a new medication and advocate for their colleagues to try the medicine.  maybe  500 -  1000 for a dinner talk  - it is not so common in the last several years so i am guessing . the real dirty dealing is in the way that  evidence based medicine  is skewed to extoll benefits of new medicines. sometimes those benefits  are real but often very minimal for all the extra money. only big pharma has the money to sponsor the research behind  ebm  and they have a thousand ways to put lipstick on a pig. to me  the bigger scandal is the way the medical journals pass on this biased research. they have not followed through on promises to police the trial data that they made after vioxx killed thousands of people. most doctors are not aware of the degree of bias in what they are presented by journals and in continuing medical education. peer review is also gamed. a few years ago  the standards for starting people on cholesterol medicine were changed to recommend statin meds for several million more americans. there was no new data. the statins are lifetime meds and the percent of people actually helped is small  so many take the meds with no benefit - and side effects are minimized by the way the drug trials are conducted. major medical organizations  state medical boards  etc are heavily politicized. doctors are not controlled through bribes but through biased  ebm   a complicit medical press   medical debts  large mortgages  their own fault but it is rational is you are early in career to stretch the budget  and desire to keep their families in the middle class or better. and we brainwash ourselves  after years of  training.
@re most  thank you for your reply.  do they make any extra money for pain management patients and their  contracts   i had a discussion with a pain management doctor in hospice. he said he only takes cancer or hospice types of patients because he doesn t have to worry about contracts.
@ghosty426  i think the contracts are documents that the patients sign  typically agreeing to frequent drug testing - tests prove they are not taking anything else than prescribed  but marijuana is sometimes accepted  and that they are taking the prescribed meds so not selling it on the street. suboxone for opiate addicts is not very profitable for clinics and i ve seen it limited by hospitals because they might even lose money. but pain clinics can make a lot of money  even if they are legitimate - i think most  of them are. pill mills prescribe freely  do nothing to stop diversion  resale on the street  and are illegal. the dea can shut them down and they do if they see enough evidence. meanwhile other legit doctors are sometimes afraid of running afoul of the dea when they are compassionate  and flexible and go a little outside of the guidelines. sounds like the doctor you you talked to decided to stick with a select group where there there is no reason for controversy - at least do a little good.
@re most  thank you for your kind condolences.   i experienced one of those adc dream visits from my immortal beloved high school sweetheart after she died from breast cancer back in 2002. she let me know there s life more beautiful after death and more heavenly joys than this world could ever offer.   it was also a blessing for the future when i lost my son.  i know life is eternal.     i also recommend the latest hagmann report video on rumble with steve quayle.  that s  where this country is headed.
there are more docs than you might guess going into various kinds of concierge care  some doing excellent practices with like-minded doctors but they are pay when you come in.  they do not get involved with insurances because they are then controlled by them.
@ghosty426  personally   plenty
just an update for anyone who was curious. she has been home since friday and in this short time  i have already seen a massive improvement in her condition. she can move her legs again  she can sit up in bed on her own  and thanks to a decent diet  her color is already starting to return. she s got a long road ahead of her with physical therapy before she ll be able to walk again  but just being at home and cared for by myself  and the home-care nurses i hired is such a drastic improvement that i m feeling optimistic for the first time since this ordeal began. i am just extremely grateful to be in a position to care for her at home  because if i d have left her in the hospital  i am convinced that she would have been dead in a month.
i ve told my family the same hospitals i m terrified of. i tell them drive very safe and vitamin up and stay healthy. most hospitals seem as corrupt as our school system is. so sad to see this in america. i never knew these things were so bad!
we need to get back to basics with our health!!
@jami barnett  medical staffers transfer the stress put on them - to the patients!
@steve kaylor   i ve seen that. i feel if your going to go into nursing you need compassion and empathy as well as knowledge. seriously lacking in the model of  health  they have set up these days.
@jami barnett  yes  know your nursing science - and then help people get better!            since this faltering health care-financial system is stressing nurses  et.al. - a 1933 like bankruptcy reorganization of the dollar based system is a mandatory step toward alleviating finance related stresses and restoring better care!
same with dental care
yes
yes  it s crept onto vet care. they bully you with their  standard of care . thankfully i m alternatively trained in all regards.
i believe that some are like this but thankfully not all and hopefully not most.  god bless
@michelley b.  honestly i think its been bad w dental all along
@ hed  ugh
yes  and as a certified veterinary technician for 30  years i agree.  i stopped working in clinics after 10 years and started my own business.  it s worse now because the pay is better.  when i started you didn t make even decent wages.  the first day of school we were told if you re in this for money  to get up and leave now be you won t be making any.  now they pay them well  they re often far less compassionate and it has driven the prices up at your vet beyond what people can pay.  if you don t have pet insurance  you and your pet are screwed.  emergency services want thousands up front for anything and will gladly watch you cry as you euthanize your pet instead.  literally  millions of pets are euthanized every year due to this because of outrageous prices.  a simple dental costs more than a spay used to. i m ashamed of people in my profession.
@nm c  i heard something from another youtube video  not sure how accurate it is i haven t really looked into it myself  but apparently things like cavities in our teeth are filled with soft metals and things like that that are harmful to our mind and so on. now if this is true  it s a pretty scary thought for me because i ve personally had multiple cavities filled and have not taken the best care of my mouth. oh well  at least i have the son of god to save me and take me out of this wicked world. no worries.
@faithgamer  hmm i ve heard that also. i know there are holistic dentists who can remove the amagdalem fillings and put composite in
@michelley b.  definitely!!!
i work in healthcare and i feel like superman one day and burned out the next.  i can t save all the patients but i will try.  it is a moral responsibility to me. nothing to do with my employer. i took on an oath to take care of patients. i don t care what corporate and government tell me.  patients care is  1 end of the story  no compromise.  you speak the truth.
it is my plan to avoid going into the medical system for any type of treatment. i got out the hospital system back in 2013 and it saddens me the state of things going on these days  but we all know it is by design. i now serve as a nurse in the insurance industry. i did lose one job over the you know what  but gained another. if it comes down to it  i will walk away.
hello all  wife of m here  i am also a nurse. it saddens me to read of all these tragic situations . it saddens me for a number of reasons. i thought  what i was experience and seeing as a peer   employee   along with the lack of standards and unrealistic expectations was just me. i have quit my last 2 jobs. for many of the same reasons mentioned in the comments. the apathy of nursing is terrible.  expecting a nurse to take care of 25  very sick patients in a rehab nursing home is ridiculouse. i told one family they need to take their very sick and complicated loved one back to the er.  i knew in my heart she would die if left up to our staff. we simple did not have the time for her acute needs.   we have to many agency nurses working for us  different  one each night.  no dr. on site  after 5pm. only tele health dr.  for an emg call  you have to wait 15 min to get a face to face time on the i pad!!  i predict that health care will go broke. forcing the long term   rehab facilitis to be federally run.
always had health insurance through my employers. i ve been completely stripped away of my life s savings 3 times with medical bills... even with insurance. i had health insurance through the state as well. back in 2015 i broke my hand which required minor surgery and a few pins. it cost me  17 000 after insurance. in 2016  i had to get rectal surgery which cost me another  17 000. this year my son s birth cost me  20 000 after insurance. they did the max out of pocket on my wife and then started to bill parts of the birth directly to my son. i barley make  50k a year  i dont drink  i dont smoke  i am a veteran  and was a police officer  but this country has done nothing but fuck me.
i m not a healthcare provider  but i spent enough time in and out of doctor s offices and hospitals at a young age and you are correct. i quit going to doctors over 10 yrs ago. the politics are a stumbling block to good healthcare. i love to learn and educate myself and have a natural memory retainage for medical health knowledge and it has made me acutely aware of how unknowledgable many in the healthcare industry are. i do my best to take care of myself and ultimately trust in the lord to take care of me. my life and my days are in his hands. he is my physician. i try not to worry about the what ifs and just stay away from doctor s if i can help it.
a neighbor kid said he wanted to study nursing which he grew up and did.  their family really loved music and were accomplished musicians including song writing.  i spoke to him about his work and he said  it s great!  they know i m a musician and song writer and let me take off any time i want to go perform or hold song writing workshops .  being kind  i didn t say anything but thought  really    i sure hope i don t have to rely on care from someone whose mind is more focused on a different career.  sadly  after open heart surgery i met more than one who was there for reasons other than providing the best care possible.  be sure you have a personal advocate if you ever are admitted to a hospital!
you re efforts and dedication are absolutely appreciated ma am
she 1000  speaks truth. i work in a hospital and have told everyone i know for the last few years that if you go to a hospital the chances are very high you will not leave alive. trust me folks  the hospitals were complicit in this disgusting event and they will be held accountable.
an active rt and have been following you for years.  i have been watching this unfold for years also.  it is a shame how corrupt the industry is.  thank-you pn
love you  pn! thank you for all you do for us to keep us well   informed. so happy to see you re feeling better now. with love and gratitude  shari
i graduated from nursing school in 1966. worked 42 years as an rn. i loved nursing. but stated seeing changes in attitudes  nurses becoming more disheartened.  in my second year of nursing school  one third of my class was asked to leave  reason  that they were not nursing material. about 20 years into my nursing   a fellow nurse told me the people going into nursing was for financial security. i was speechless.  but how true it has become.
you summed it up  sister!  p.s. i noticed telehealth providers  phone number and website on the insurance card  care more about their license than the patient  every consultation ends with a recommendation to go to er.
i m still here! in the hospital holding the line! it s not easy for those of us in healthcare. we are doing our best under extreme pressure to do more with less. i agree that people need to take health care into their own hands. get healthy  eat well  exercise  don t follow the sad diet it creates patients for big pharma! they want you to take more pills and jabs to your detriment. i pray for you patriot nurse keep fighting the good fight. i will too!
after finishing your video i have more to add. i personally have been kicked out of 3 medicare clinics over the past couple of years for refusing to take vaccines. first it was just the flu shot. i wasn t rude or hateful but in order to get away with kicking me out they wrote that i was  abusive  when in fact i was not abusive  but  i was firm in stating i do not take vaccines. one nurse  sub par at best and from south of the border  called me at my home three times calling me names  telling me i m not compliant  and threatening me. i finally told her  what i put in my body is between me and my doctor  she reported me for being abusive to her  even though she called me at home 3 times calling me names. this is the health care system we now have in place.
sebastian hospital almost killed me for a basic procedure in 2021. went in to have two small tumors removed from my bladder. after surgery you have to have you bladder flushed out for a couple hrs and then you go home. the nurses let the fluid run out several times and i had to ring the bell to notify them. well because it happened so often my bladder went into muscle spasms   i don t wish that pain on my worst enemies  witch caused my bladder to bleed more. i was getting blood drawn every two hours and my hemoglobin went from a 10.8 to a 7.1 because of the loose of blood. i stayed like this from after surgery at 6pm till 7am the next day. doctor took one look at me and rushed me to a cti scam  on the way back to my room i stopped breathing. because of this i had severe organ failure. i caught pneumonia  was on dialysis for 8 months  took me several weeks to walk and feed myself again. i asked many times for my doctor only to be told i was over reacting. if someone is in pain and passing in and out of consciousness  i don t think they are overacting. i had to have another surgery in 2022 and they again let my blood count drop dramatically  causing me to stop breathing. nowhere near as bad the first time. and to think i still need another surgery. this scares the living crap out of me and i don t know what to do . i sincerely apologize for my shitty spelling and grammar. learning disability  another reason i m looked down at
thank you for this video  patriot nurse! i am a nurse and have been in nursing administration since the end of 2019. what the pandemic has done to the workforce is scary  infuriating  and has forced a desperate workforce shortage. my mother has been in the hospital for almost 4 weeks  and if i wasn t there everyday overseeing her care  and demanding that the basics  hygiene  repositioning  etc.  be done   she would be lying there rotting away  while the doctors come in for 5 mins  and rush out the door. i can attest to the fact that empathic care is dead. and while i will conceed that there are certain medical conditions that require acute medical care  people need to realize that they are entering those doors at their own risk. now more than ever  it is imperative to get one s health in order and to be completley self-reliant.
my wife walked away from her ot work two months ago. she worked in multiple skilled nursing facilities and couldn t take it anymore. she s still a wreck.  everything you ve said in this video is the truth.
hello from the uk again pn  i just wanted to add my two cents worth to this subject. we ve had  the benefits   obvious sarcasm for the liberals  of government provided healthcare here in britain since the 50 s  and it s been failing since the 50 s too. the nhs has been an ever increasing government white elephant where standards have been in free fall  bureaucracy increasing  and satisfaction diminishing over the years. we now have a broken healthcare system akin to the third world  despite the billions being thrown into this money pit  with the total money being wasted being larger than some countries gdp. ever since the kenyan fraudster inflicted obamacare on americans  i saw the decline of your once envied system becoming inevitable too  as government should have nothing to do with such a critical part of your infrastructure. as we re witnessing on both sides of the pond  anything the government provides is going to be overly expensive  third rate  and most important of all  rationed. we re now in the incredulous situation of having an out of control juggernaut of a government telling doctors and nurses how to care  teachers how to teach  and the self employed  wealth creating part of society how to run their business. the nhs in britain now has record waiting lists with filthy wards  and more chiefs than indians. a friend who works in the nhs told me that when he started his career there  he had two managers above him but when he recently retired  he had twenty seven. one nhs are recently advertised for the position of  shared life experience coordinator  at a salary of  130 000!  while nurses have to threaten strike action just to get a living wage! this typifies the waste  attitude and mindset of this organisation  which is now the uk s largest employer  as ridiculous as that sounds. the money wasted on the convid19 theatrics is beyond madness  but it s a reminder that socialism is wonderful   .until it inevitably runs out of someone else s money. sadly i can t see a solution to the healthcare crises in either country  and the whole thing is designed to fail  all orchestrated by psychopath  criminal politicians who only rule due to the corruption and rigging of our electoral systems. of course many will see this as being the opinion of just another crazy tinfoil hat wearing right wing extremist  but let s just see what happens during the coming few years  as our nations implode before our disbelieving  gullible eyes. keep up the great work pn  your channel has become one of my go to sources for real news  god bless you and yours.
a few years ago  i went to a young doctor who told he didn t know how much longer he d be a doctor. when i asked why not  he said that he became a doctor to heal people  and that s not what his profession was all about. then we sat down  and he spent three hours telling me how to improve my health through eating and lifestyle. i hope he found a job that let s him take care of patients the way he wants.
yep  100  correct. the double edged sword faced by sick or injured family or friends - seek subpar inpatient medical care or take your chances at home with trusted family. i would be lying to viewers if i didn t warn viewers about larger metro hospitals with staff that  selectively   does not speak english and ignores patients and their families. it is horrible... like americans who worked and contributed to society are now abandoned to strangers who cannot communicate and do not care.
they screwed us all.  i m sorry to hear your story.
this is exactly what i do and the exact attitude i have!!!   hallelujah!   jesus is my healer and protector!
amen. and  that s how it should be.
you are 100  correct! there is also the danger of doctors and nurses with poor critical thinking that do not focus on the source of the illness or disease but just look to check a box and move onto anything else but the sick person in front of them. i honestly met an older pt in the hospital who told me  the hospital is the place you go when you want to die!  he was right! he s passed on since. i plan to stay out of the hospital by all measures   any means.
he isn t called the divine physician for nothing
stock up on any homeopathic meds you can as they plan to go after these  taking them off of the market.
i trust none of them!..they could care less...you could go in there dying and the first thing out of their mouth is do you have insurance
retired bsn here.  nursing schools will take anyone anymore because there is such a  shortage of nurses!   i recently quit as an adjunct clinical instructor in an accelerated nursing program because there were so many students who were not  nursing material  as you have alluded to above  entitled  and only in it for financial security  as you have mentioned.  oh  there were some good ones  but more that were not.  it was just too much.  i m much happier now with my life  and no longer stressed.
i m a retired teacher.. teaching now is a mess too!  most i worked with were there for those kids... i still have hope but when teachers are told to do a  b and c that may go against earlier common sense education they either quit or    sad   so sad!
yes @claudia ebner  same reason why teaching profession is a mess too.   they do it because there is little accountability  you are unlikely to get fired and even if you don t like kids  the benefits and state pension draws them.
unbelievable!!!!    how dare she do that !
while you are demanding basic care for your mother  there are several other patients who don t have family present and they are getting no care at all.
after raising my siblings and i   my mom went back to college to become an ot. she worked in that field for about 15 years.  it severely drained her. after she retired she no longer looked exhausted and stressed all the time.  also from what she told me about the job  her employers seemed to only care about treatments that they could bill people. they wanted high productivity  aka billable hours   but didn t consider the notes and paperwork as productive even though it had to be done for the company to be paid.
i walked away as a pta in snf three months ago. i couldn t take it any longer.  i had been there 15 years. they want robots. patriot nurse is absolutely speaking the truth!
@indigo bunting  i learned about this 90  billable hours nonsense as an slp in a snf. it barely leaves enough time to walk between rooms. i learned to document in rooms with the patients in there. i got extra time with patients who were mostly cognitively not there  or otherwise non-participatory  so i could catch up on notes then. they weren t benefiting from my services  but i had to milk their approved hours out  still had to see each one for 30 min.
i ve said this many times this past couple years... i wish so much i could use united healthcare ins to take myself to a veterinarian instead of a human doctor.  i bet they would run every test  treat me and make me feel better.  i already take animal meds for myself because animals get better care than we do.
thank you for all you do! i am a registered nurse with over 3 decades of experience. everything you said is the absolute truth! it is heartbreaking.
paramedic in canada here  for now . this is 100  accurate. especially with regards to how protocols are set up for liability avoidance first  profit second  and patient care a distant third. i strongly recommend being extremely careful with divulging any personal information to medical practitioners. the health care field skews heavily left-wing  and some of them are among the most prejudiced and vindictive people i ve ever met. if you hold any beliefs or values that are not in compliance with the stereotypical progressive mindset  keep them to yourself at all times.
had an accident at work three months ago.  hospital did an ultrasound to look for a blood clot in my leg.  sent scan to a third party to examine.  bill is 420 bucks.  they sent bill to me personally even though it is workman s comp billing.  knew i was in for a long fight when i called the company and one of the prompts was  press 1 if you are paying a bill.... press 2 if you are calling from a lawyers office .   give them insurance information for billing.  next month got another bill.  went to hr this time  she knows the company because another guy has been fight to get his bill paid for two years.  called the company and got the run around on speaker phone.  called insurance contact directly and they said claim is covered but company does not want to submit the bill to them so they can pay.
excellent information  thank you and agree getting as healthy as possible through diet is essential  doing keto got me out of diabetic range  lowered my blood pressure and regulated my thyroid levels.  now i m off thyroid meds and off blood pressure meds  never took metformin  just did keto .  stay as far away from all processed foods as possible  pre-packaged  microwave  foods    zero sugars  no white wheat flour and buy apple cider vinegar from bragg s to help with digestion and many other ailments.  getting as healthy as possible will help you not be dependent on their system  which is crumbing anyway.  oh and pray in jesus mighty name...god bless
i am 63 years old. have not been to a regular doctor visit in almost 8 years. i did come down with covid in the beginning of 2021. it qas rough. took me about 3 months to get over it. did go to emergency room for an overnight stay. got my fluids back up etc...went home on oxygen for 3 weeks. other than that i take care of myself and husband. we take lots and lots of supplements. eat out rarely. get as much exercise as possible. i gave up on doctors years ago. managed to get my hubby off of high blood pressure meds 2 years ago. by the way...didn t get the jab and won t.
truth! i m on a small town ambulance service. protocol is mainly there to keep providers from getting sued. the rules we have in place to follow are not in the patients best interest. our closest hospital that we are almost always required to transport to is a failure. people frequently leave the hospital in worse shape then they were when they went to the er. it is amazing the number of people i have talked to that say if something happened to them  don t call 911 and personally drive them to a different hospital or leave them to die. it s so sad that they same places we were used to going to for help are the places that could kill us.
it woke many of us up. my elderly mom experienced abuse 3 different hospital stays at 2 diff facilities. my personal experience - woke up in critical care. i had an accident on myself. the 2 older nurses laughed and made fun of me. it happened twice as i was coming out of anesthesia. after i was moved to the regular floor  i had great care from 4 young nurses. midwest girls that had manners and empathy. they told me that the other staff in the hospital refused to work with them in cc. before i left the hospital  the caseworker brought the administrator in and i filed a report.
as a nurse she is absolutely correct!
we also need to change our lifestyle so we can stay healthy since healthcare is getting so horrible. so sad to say this as a nurse
you hit the nail on the head with this.  i actually had a doctor lie to me when i asked if he would do a d-dimer  test on my elderly  81 yo  fully vaxxed  fully boosted mother.  she went against my recommendation for the first time ever out of fear.   she went to the hospital as she became unbalanced and completely disoriented.  she recovered in the hospital shortly after admission.  they did all sorts of tests  mri s etc and found that part of her brain had atrophied but said it was due to age and that there was evidence of a mini stroke some time in her past.  when i asked if they did or could do the d-dimer test he said  well  we could but we d have to inject her with a dye and then do another mri.   she decided she didn t want that.  though i knew about the test i didn t know how it was performed.  i looked it up and every patient admitted to the er of the hospital which website i was looking at  had the test as part of the triage.  this was not the hospital she was in.  it s a simple finger prick blood test!  now  tell me why that so called doctor made such a big deal out of the request and lied through his teeth about what it entailed
thank you so much for all your hard work putting these videos together. and prayers for a full recovery
we ve been witnessing this for several years with both family and clients. even women giving birth being put through the ringer. just happened with an extended family member. went in bc of pain near her due date. thought it was labor pains. ended up having her appendix removed followed by a c-section. what happened after was when the nightmare began. baby put thru unnecessary surgery. put on antibiotics.  unnecessary bc they simply failed to change her feeding tube when they were supposed to  then essentially jumped the gun on an  emergency surgery  or  she could die. needless to say  a month later  the baby was released. when wanting to be released earlier  they were threatened. plus there are all these ridiculous mandatory  classes  like using a car seat appropriately.  don t even get me started on my mother-in-law. told by her cardiologist she needed open heart surgery right away. very clogged artery and  she could die!   uh  hello  she could die any day or any year. she was 85. did the invasive surgery and 10 days later died. in addition to renal failure  not being able to speak bc of tube down her throat  and not being able to see her family   guess the cause of death  sepsis. half a mil and 10 days of misery to avoid an all edged worse fate.
very good word and warning. i was a medical provider until several months ago. i was forced out of my job after disagreeing with the practice s administrators over treatment of patients. today everything is about making money  not patient and employee care or safety. it s truly gotten disgraceful.
you have no idea how true this is. i wasn t given appropriate care at two ers and one md practitioner. i was left with pneumonia  a collapsed lung  and several pleural effusions untreated for 2 weeks. i was finally taken to a neighboring city on death s door. i was sent by ambulance to the regional trauma hospital and put in icu for 7 days and another 7 days with tubes in my lungs surviving on dilaudid. i was transferred to a medical lodge for therapy and 6 weeks of daily iv bag infusions for a spine and lung infection. i lost 50 lbs and i m now home lucky to be alive but i have mesothelioma i now have to be treated for with chemo and radiation. get a second and third opinion. you are now an inconvenience and a number. i am a personal trainer and have worked out for 45 years and i will never be the same. this is no joke!
you are so correct! my husband went through a very intense year of colon rectal cancer ending in a month long hospital stay after a colon rectal surgery. while in the hospital we suffered through so many  traveling medical teams and actually did not have one nurse that was considered his nurse   very scary when transferred from icu to regular hospital stay. in icu he had a nurse that was there most of the shift. we felt safer in icu    actually having the nurse there to check on him and follow through was such a peace of mind! we felt it was more traumatic than it should of been. and i can honestly say god brought him through and we could bring him home!  i m appalled at our healthcare system and you are so right to get this out there because it s almost as if you take your life in your own hands when entering into a hospital now. there were a few wonderful nurses and thank god for his surgeon but in this case i m sorry to say the bad ones outweighed the good.
my mother was misdiagnosed for months with constipation even tho she told them she wasn t.  it was ovarian cancer that spread because no one cared for almost a year.  she eventually found a great oncologist that really cared and was willing to try natural and homeopathic and alternative ways to treat cancer.  this doc was fired.  my mom spoke to several of this docs patients and they all loved her because she was willing to try anything to help them. one woman had cancer for 7 years and prohealthcare of wisconsin refused to help her until this one woman doctor prescribed her a treatment given to patients for diabetes and this actually helped her. a week after she prescribed this off label drug she was fired. several other patients have the same experience where she tried helping them in alternative ways which were helping. unfortunately this meant not simply going along with whatever big pharma wanted to prescribe. so they fired her and in our area she is no longer allowed to work within a 50-mile radius of her previous employer which was prohealthcare of wisconsin which is the most horrible group of doctors. they do not care and they brush everything off and if you go into the emergency room you will wait for hours do not bother with prohealth care of wisconsin. my mother-in-law had breast cancer and they gave her a horrible surgery that was a total hack job and she has had problems with swelling and pus and draining for months afterwards and they keep telling her everything s fine it s fine you re fine. no one i know in the greater milwaukee area will intentionally seek treatment at prohealthcare.
so true. my health plan contracted with another company to supply me with certain services. the problem  the other company has no phone number and apparently uses ai to respond to at least some issues. i needed help to book an appointment online  and there was no one to help me who could understand my issue. ai certainly didn t get it  and even the health plan could not phone them. it was a nightmare  and i fear more are ahead of us.
love your content patriot! everything you said in this video is so true and been worsening for decades and your advice to people is spot on as always.  that said i believe what also needs to be said is its time for true conservative minded people to band together and pool resources to develope our own practices and centers totally apart from the establishment! if change is truly desired resistance must be made and like minded conservative groups and individuals must bind together in unity and in support of one another!
i live in a little rural mountain community and i go to a np. she is better than most dr s i ve had!  she not only tells you the meds you can take  but the natural choices choices that help so much! ex turmeric for inflammation.  she feels like a mom.
yes  i recently retired from nursing for the same concerns.
that conjures up dystopian images for me !   a 1984- ish  type of hiding our  wrong think
thanks for the heads-up analysis for diverging medical preferences and beliefs to my pcp   i ve noticed that recommendations for medical procedures lead to a more profitable outcome for them medical system .
this is so sad and unbelievable that you even have to say this.  these people swore an oath and it means nothing anymore to those people you describe.  absolutely horrifying.  thank you for what you do and i pray it will get better so good and caring person can keep working to help others.
wow!  that reminds me of a hospital i used to work at.  it was a running joke in my department  radiology  - 1st.- we do the paperwork. 2nd. - we do our continuing education credits. 3rd.- we take care of our patients. priorities  right
@miki miki  exactly
excellent analysis.
i m a nurse and as a teenager i worked as a nurses aid and to get into my nursing program you had to have a interview and they wanted some medical experience to be accepted. so many of the new young nurses coming into the profession never had outside experience and they are shocked or not emotionally mentally ready and it shows with poor bedside or the nurse not able or wanting to do the  dirty work  .
sadly so.
standard operating proceedure
their thinking will come for them  god s karma is real.
@tradmanmike  amen!!!!! babylon is falling!!!!!! make sure you are spiritually aware and connected to god!!!!!!!! i am!!!
its evil  its just that simple. this place is dying but thank you lord for your plan unfolding   seek a daily relationship with jesus  its the only chance to survive what s coming..
for the love of money is the root of all evil!
i love my np she actually listens.
ah  the good ole days  as it was as it should be again.
np    nurse practitioner  or  naturopathic physician
@sophie snuffy    do you use black pepper or do they contain black pepper with them  edit  after researching  i discovered that the meriva-based products render black pepper unnecessary.
you are blessed.
i ve been in medicine since 2010. this lady hasn t told a lie. everything she says from stem to stern is true.
this is all so true! i have two doctors and two nurses in my family and it makes a huge difference in the advice  treatment  and follow up that i should have been getting!
i was in lna for over 18 years at a large hospital. despite having a strongly written letter from my provider  stating that i was not a candidate for vaccination  i was told that i had to have it by hr. it was  for my health  . this despite the letter from my provider  stating that i would likely have an anaphylactic reaction. i chose to leave versus taking something that i knew was not safe for me. i have never regretted my decision.  healthcare is definitely declining. we need to take care of ourselves.
yes  i believe this is why my father died in june!at the er they sent him home after he collapsed  couldn t walk   was still disoriented!!!  he was back at the er 3 hrs later by balance again!   i wish i was there at the time but i was in another state.  once he was admitted and in critical care the  protocol time !!!!!  they put him in a recovery room too soon!!he quit breathing less than 20 hrs being in the recovery room. he was trached and the rest is too sad to talk about.  it in all instances i think the protocol schedules are what helped push him to an untimely death i did get there 2 days after he was first admitted thank goodness! it took me two days to drive there.better also have a strong will advocate for you too.
we ve been seeing this and knew it was coming for years. as homesteaders in maine who work every day  eat our own food meat  we ve been doing medicinal herbs for about 5 years and will continue. we do not use the  sick care system . i think that s about all we can do. god bless and may he hold you in his hands.
my wife in an onc nurse. she just made a career change because of all the things you mention. she is now a case manager trying to fight this fight. you speak the truth.
i m an emt and i work patient transport. my medic partner and i were talking just last night about how much more the patients talk to us than they do the actual doctors.they talk to the nurses  a lot  and to us.. a lot. the older patients don t do the virtual chat bollocks. they don t like it. but  they have very little choice in the matter because that is the  new way . plus  lets not mention er wait times. i picked up a patient  recently  who had to wait 37 hours before she got a bed.. staff shortages on that one.and  the supply issues you spoke of... preach it! ohio state is building a new cancer hospital  they don t need  yet  patient needs are hurting for some  unexplainable  reason.. also  next time you come back this way.... i am so in!
my brother s mother-in-law had a stroke.  the  treatment  was to put her in a bed a sedate her to unconscious.  they then recommended she be placed in hospice  care - basically sentencing her to death - because she was unresponsive.   my brother s daughter is a nurse and on her days off she went up to investigate.  she got it straightened out  and the patient is now ready for pt and long term care.  you must have a knowledgeable patient advocate for loved ones in hospital.  what the pn says is absolutely true.
i ve been a nurse since 1984. i m just done. abusive administration  nasty patients   ridiculous politics on the floor. i emotionally checked out a few years ago. i just can t go in and provide  care  this way. i asked god what am i doing here  covid was the last straw. coercion  threats  bribery  ostracized because i refused the jab. watched them lie to patients so they d take it. then watched the patients die suddenly of unknown  reasons in my al facility.  i can t do this anymore.
so glad to see you back and informing us once again on health care system.  we knew you had been very ill and so prayed for you during this time.  thanks for being here and continue to get well.
sadly  she is 100  correct and i m a doctor who has left hospital medicine due to forced protocols and other issues.
i am a retirement-age md trying to figure out an alternative private practice model where i can keep going outside the corporate systems. absolute truth spoken  -- very well. thank you!  protocols have replaced guidelines and clinical thinking.   we follow the experts   is what i hear from white-coats who used to be doctors.
this rings so true for me! as a rn i am astounded by the younger nurses who continually put process over patient. it s difficult being a patient advocate in this system!! i hate it and want out!! just don t know what to do!
thank god for you patriot nurse!  your videos are so needed. i ve noticed in the last few decades that the quality of care has gone down in part because it seems like people got into the industry purely for the money not because they care for people. i know there are people who do care but they are fewer and farther between nowadays. i am a type 1 diabetic and i am concerned about having insulin available in the future.
i have witnessed the mistreatment and negligence in the past 3 weeks  with my mom being in a rehab facility for a hip surgery. she s coming home today  thank hashem!!!  i have had several fights with staff over her treatment.
we hold you in prayer routinely. your guidance is so valuable and we thank you for your time and efforts. keep on  keep n on as we said in the 70s!
i m not jabbed.  i avoid doctors at all costs  and the only way i ll go to a hospital is if it s an emergency and i m not conscious!  i take care of my health with diet  supplements  and exercise.  i m 66 and only take 1 rx for low thyroid.  i do need to make a change from my toxic and stressful part time job.  i ve been looking and applying  and interviewed once  but didn t get hired.  praying about that  and many other things.
yes. natural medicines are my lifeline right now.i was diagnosed with cancer. the incision from the tumor debulking surgery went from my my breastbone to my pubic bone. after my first round of chemo  i just could not recover. the chemo killed my gallbladder so that had to be removed too. 18 months after ending chemo and i was still anemic and sick... and then i was re-diagnosed with cancer again. this time  i took charge of my own health and  recovery. i leaned hard into herbal medicine...and this time  i didn t get as sick. if anything  i slowly got better than i was when i started. then covid hit.i refused to get the covid vax. the bully tractics used to force people to get an inadequately tested vax for something that  according to the statistics  just was not that lethal made me suspicious of it. then i got covid  delta variant . i was sick for an entire month  but never needed to be hospitalized. my oncologist ordered me to go to the er to be checked since the treatment protocols increased my risk of  inappropriate bleeding   avastin . the doctor there sent me home.  there s nothing we can do for you. you re sick and short on resources  but other than that  you re doing fine. you don t need to be here. being here could make you worse. go home and rest. keep doing whatever you re doing. it s working for you.  i have to respect that doc  he was honest. his bedsider manner sucked  but he was honest. i went home and rested and continued with the nac  mullein    plantain syrup  plantago lanceolata from my yard . after a bit  i got better and finished my chemo. 1 month after i finished chemo  my blood counts were already back to normal.i get sick more quickly than i used to  but there are a whole pack of reasons for that. most of them stem from the reason i was gutted like a fish in the first place. being poisoned repeatedly over the course of a few years is gonna have a long term effect. the body can only take so much. but  herbal medicine is treating my issues more gently than pharma would with fewer side effects and using less medicine. i m treating the cause rather than the symptoms. it feels good to know that i grew the lemon balm that calms my stress in my own garden. it feels good to know that if i begin feeling some distress  i can treat it immediately  before it gets out of hand rather than wait to see an overworked doctor who will tell me to take a pill that probably won t work anyway.it feels good to be in control of myself.
my husband went into a clinal trial at a very well know cancer hospital in boston  the immunotherapy did the reverse and made it spread to everything  they had to admit him and could never get under his pain  they wanted him transferred to hospice.  i said no  you never got under the pain that he was admitted for  after 1 month and less than 10 hours left for him to live they called in hospital hospice  this was august  they are deplorable.  his immunotherapy cost 45k per treatment and doubled when a duo was administered  the hospital cost were over the moon.  they are gauging the system.  they don t save lives they kill.
patriot nurse i just read a book called  mary on horseback  it was a read-aloud from  my christian homeschool. it reminded me of what you are doing in today s age for all of us via these videos and the classes you offer. this book was for my elementary aged daughter. god bless you for all you do i hope you look into that book it s a quick easy read. but boy this woman poured her heart and soul into helping people. like you do. i m still keeping you in my prayers. glad to see you back doing videos. heal well with the light of god .
which herbs do you grow
@miki miki  we grow the usual savory herbs for cooking and herbs for teas. we grow things like elecampane  echinacea  yarrow  motherwort  stinging nettle  st jon s wort  etc... about 20 different ones so far. we have used some  but are constantly adding to our knowledge. a lot of the last 2 years has been concentrated on learning the grow flowering cycle  then we ll start using more next year.
@camille patterson  excellent  i ll take note. we started growing april 2022 for the 1st time  we learned some things  but we have much more to learn. god be with you and yours
@miki miki  oh  i have tons to learn as well. lol my first year or 2 with anything new is more to learn the grow cycle than anything. may god bless your endeavors as well.
tell her we appreciate her.
is that a easier job. i thought about that
my granddaughter is studying to be a peds oncologist. hoping for her future!!
case managers are getting very important! good for her!  they are often the only voice one has when we are being lied to by doctors and nurses.
@angie whitley  physically  yes. she is now almost 60yo some it was getting difficult at bedside. now it s an entirely different sore of difficulty. it s constant problem solving all day  every day.
maybe look into direct patient care. they are clinics that don t take health insurance. patients pay a monthly fee and have direct access to their providers. we have participated in this for a few years now. it s amazing.
@lisa eldridge  thank you. i have started learning about dpc. i want my focus to be long covid  acute as need arises  psychiatry for ptsd in particular  and neuroimmunology. weird combination  and i would not be the best at general primary care. in other words  i need some colleagues with complementary skills. for anyone in primary care  dpc is the way to go.
start a private business to help advocate for patients when in hospitals. doctors and nurses know the ins-n-outs hence the  politicos  so people can get the right care. people can pay you to utilize your expertise.
there are folks out there doing this  drmccoulough
just look into the information you were trained and pushed on for years.  so much has been askewed to push drugs.   i m off thyroid meds because i took charge.  i have two friends that have been seriously injured by meds pushed by doctors .
concierge medicine. limit patients  but give them great care. you can always do a little volunteering to balance.
i ll pray with you!
celeste solum.......will help keep u safe.....
joining you in prayer sister...god is faithful
stress is a killer.  i ve intentionally not gone back into it work since c19 because of the damaging effects of stress.
@ispy saidmylittleeye  great!
i m with you sister!  have got off all meds but 4.  working on those as well.  isn t it interesting that pharmakea is sorceries in the scriptures.
find someone who has the same blood type as you and is also unjabbed. don t accept jabbed donor blood.
i was on the same rx.  then  recently  i ran across symptoms of low iodine. the symptoms were the same as the low thyroid. i ordered some iodine as a supplement. have almost weaned completely off synthroid.  we shall see if this works. i have been on it for twenty years so i hope it works out.
@hycoperosity  my recommendation would be to find a local homeopath and or herbalist and work with them. i also would start researching alternatives medications  growing foraging for your own herbs to make medications tincture elixirs salves. there are a lot of videos and books about the subject. most medications have been derived and developed from the same chemical composition in plants  so learning and using them is beneficial. all the best to you !
just saw where delta is hiring remote workers.
ditto.. must be unconscious and unable to babble  i do not consent.
my partner bob and i are not jabbed either. he switched dr s last year because his was retiring. he was asked about the vax once again  and refused. his new doctor was ok with it  gave him the standard line i d suggest it because of your age  he was 67 at the time  but she accepted his decision  and said it was a choice.  so far he seems to like her  but will know more in january after his next physical. he s relatively healthy  thyroid meds for a non functioning thyroid  and a stomach pill for his acid reflux. the less he see s doctors the happier he is!
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  thanks for the recommendation!
@hycoperosity  i ordered some raw desiccated  thyroid glandular  from forefronthealth to try in case i can t get my rx.  i guess we all need to be researching alternatives.
@denise human
@sandylou in az
@never saynever  that s great.  i wish you success.   i have some nascent iodine on hand.  i will give it a try.
@rnupnorthbrrr sm  subscribed to raincountry and found the video you mentioned.  thank you!
btw  i m a retired teacher.  i retired early because i was assaulted by a student during class.  i got zero support from administration.  teaching isn t like it used to be either!  so glad i m retired!
@fran webb  delta dental  or which delta
@lora bor  they do not separate jabbed and unjabbed blood.
@xboobtubex smith  for my family i started building a list of folks not jabbed in the event someone needs clean blood.
@xboobtubex smith  the folks i have would be on-site to give  i guess they could switch but there would some type of chain of custody with personal blood donations.
@xboobtubex smith  do you have first hand experience   if so where did it happen.
also  take your vits  especially c  d  zinc  and others you ll find on health channels  drink plenty of bottled water and teas of all kinds  lemon water everyday. no junk food or mass produced sweet stuff. sprinkle turmeric on rice and vegetables  and black pepper.
@georgia francis  i said that i took lots of supplements  that includes vitamins c  d3  and zinc   and that i watch my diet.
@georgia francis
2023 will be better for you i bet.best of wishes for you and my prayers.
@richard sledgecock  thanks.  same to you.
so 60percent of my clients are on thyroid meds   why are thyroids not working in humans anymore  anyone else curious
@valerie r  bless you!
@faithgamer
@hycoperosity  i am also on levothroxine. wish i wasn t! i m in the uk.
thank you so much pn i m so happy you are feeling better praying for you it takes a while to recover one day at a time. you are thee best.  i m a phlebotomist in the hospital i visit all the rooms i see and hear what you are talking about.  i feel like one of the only empathetic people left here.  sharing the stream as always! much love.
i wasn t feeling all to great running a fever off and on so i had my doctor to call me. the only thing she was concerned about was if i had all the vaccines. finally she told me to go to a clinic of which i had no choice. from the beginning of seeing her until now she has done a flip flop. i need to find another doctor but am having difficulty.
thanks sweetie  71 years and still going strong. no meds  no doctors  still working as a nanny and loving it. family life is stressful  and good  pretty normal now days. the thing that gets me through it all is knowing god did not bring me this far to leave me alone. i get really upset with the world as is  so i just picture myself sitting in god s hands  and know no matter what he has me. much love god bless
on my second battle with cancer and i can tell. when i went to the hospital i could barley stand up without passing out and the intake nurse wantede to walk to a waiting room pretty far back because i had no immune system  then wanted me to walk all the way back to the room to get vitals  and when i said i couldn t make it any further she got really snobby and said  well i can get you a wheel chair is all i know  then made my 60yo stroke survivor mother push me it. by time i got my vitals took my heart rate was 160  because i was severely anemic and dehydrated.
i was hospitalized for nearly a month back in 2016.  my gallbladder backed up  and i wound up with pancreatitis and sepsis.  i went into acute kidney failure and nearly died.  the care i received in the icu and while recovering was exceptional.  i couldn t have had better care.  if that would ve happened now  i don t know if i would still be alive.  covid has been used to destroy our way of life.
you are correct. my mother died because of medical incompetence during covid.
took my wife in for a medical appointment. she has to double mask when going anywhere with possible smells such as perfume  due to extreme asthma. the inner mask is a thick carbon filter mask which helps significantly in reducing odors. she can t wear it for long because she has trouble getting enough oxygen through it  but it works for short duration issues. the  nurse  checked her oxygen level and i asked if she should de-mask for a minute first  to get her oxygen level back to normal. she told me the masks in no way affect your oxygen level. i just about walked out right then. the doc herself seemed competent  but the  nurse  is dangerous.
i was just at the er last week for the first time in probably 8 years.  it is exactly what you say. i left with a fistful of scripts and no real diagnosis. i m supposed to see my primary care. called immediately and got a telle-med appointment with a pa. wth   i hope i make it that long.
my mom is a dr. she has taught me that god given natural cures for illness come first. eating healthy  getting sleep  drinking water and reducing stress and listen to your body. thanks mom.
thanks for the heads up again. i saw your other video quite a while ago where you talked about this topic also. i ve got to say that i mostly have never received great health care in my life. there have been a few good doctors here and there usually specialists but one primary care provider that was good. the rest were terrible and didn t care about helping me get the answers i needed to make the best choices for my health. so i m not really ever going to be surprised at crap care. i d be surprised at good care if i can ever find it.
i noticed that also. nurses and teachers are absolutely underpaid and abused  those with common sense and alert . my wife was an excellent pre-school teacher. decades ago i took a second job so she could quit and enjoy the kids at home. it paid off  raising our children made them superb  well behaved conservative christians. yet  the reason was that no money suffices  especially the miniscule teacher salary  for coming home tired or sad and frustrated form walking on eggshells all day. and  i always feared learning that a  karen  or  ken  would verbally abuse the greatest woman on earth that i was lucky enough to marry. i would have hunted them down  so we did not care if we downsized or even want....as long as she could be home where she is absolute queen! she loved it and was able to tackle daily errands and visit with her mother and mine  etc. happier than a bird on a french fry.   now  i have been beefing up my gold and silver holdings as well as buying xrp  only one that is legit  in uphold. things are fast approaching a nasty  result lately. i never thought my country would join in the lunatic views of other socialist and pantheocratic ones. we have inepts running every agency now and is a headless nation since the one at the helm is braindead. i already have supplies and am pretty much set for at least the basic necessities but some silver and fractional gold is also important once the dollar collapses and as a hedge against inflation. the xrp is because it surely will replace the dollar as world exchange currency since it will be digital and the value will sky rocket  is the only one i have since the others are useless air fake tokens hyped by kardashians and snoopdog.i followed all your advises  those i could afford since i don t have much land .just covering all bases!
i had a similar experience to your relative.  i was released from the hospital after major back surgery the following day  even though i told them i wasn t ready to go home.  my husband had pneumonia at the time and couldn t really care for me.  i was refusing all food and water and regular meds when i got home - have no idea why  except that i was on heavy pain drugs.  i almost died   i m told  due to dehydration and hyperglycemia.
it s very hard to stock up on medications these days sine the insurance companies closely regulate how often you can refill your medication. i take cardiac meds and wonder what other options i might have to prepare for the future. thanks for all you do  bless you.
i m 65 yo nurse and working as a home health aid bc i as a nurse can not give personalized care in other settings. when i first became a nurse we had patient contact but now it s computers   phones.i have recently been seeing my doctor and endocrinologist and as a patient   i have not been followed through with  no personal call or appt was made for my abnormal labs. i received a short text message with incomplete information on what to do next. i had to make 5 calls to talk to several people in office of both doctors to find out what are we doing next for me  i m so fed up with lack of care and concern and follow thru. my primary care provider is lazy  uninterested and just punching a time clock for what i can see. i want to switch doctors but they told me i can t . i still plan on looking for a new doctor. i m ashamed   disgusted  with the medical profession.  doing my chart app on phones  preregistration requests to do on your phone along with notifications of your results without the doctor explaining the results is such a do it yourself medical care system is shameful.
in my last job  in a neuro icu  i worked with nurses who slept at the desk for hours on end  in full view of everyone without reprimand. i worked with techs who were aggressive if they were asked to separate themselves from the 3-4 hours of screen time or school work in order to care for patients. i am gen-x and these were people born in the early 90s. i find myself in a position where i don t know where i fit  because my stress level and blood pressure can t tolerate the obstacles of apathy and aggression i face at the start of any given shift.
excellent advice patriot nurse! i m a medical coder and came to the same conclusion when the world turned upside down. i started weaning myself off big pharma meds and supplements and started learning about natural remedies.
you are so correct. i am a long time patient due to heath problems that i was born with. i have been in and out of hospital s all my life including working in a hospital for four years. when i go to doctor now  the only thing i know to say to the nurse is   one day you will be sitting on this examination table and someone else will be staying in you spot. is this how you want to be treated    my daughter is a second grade teacher. i told her to teach them well cause one day one of them could be your doctor. she said that was too scary to think about.
you are completely correct  i kept my mother the last 10 years of her life  i was fortunate enough to work for my self so i was able to advocate for her  i actually can do a better job than 50  of care nurses i dealt with.
i have noticed this big time when i go to the doctors now. my doctor was a bit candid with me about how much he has control about treating his patients and it s not a whole lot. they  the doctors  are controlled by a higher power. what ever  they  say the doctors have to do. i m trying very hard to stay out of the hospital. i have no trust in them anymore.
i remember when i was in nursing school back in 2011  there was a push to stop calling admitted people into the hospital as  patients   and instead refer to them as  clients.  i will never forget the shock i had when that was revealed. it was at that point that i really began to notice hospitals becoming more  business-like  in their demeanor to patients and their families. it s only grown since then unfortunately  and quality and genuine patient care seems to be secondary  even tertiary in some cases . truly sad.
that s amazing. my step mother s step mother was a nanny until she was 82ish.
@laura nilsen  very cool we live longer healthier active lives .. can t stop don t stop
@laura nilsen  right  got to stay active  read  play video games  word games  walk around the block everyday  go back to work  don t retire. when your brain stops  you will stop  so keep it active. go back to school  go to church and join a group of readers. do your own marketing  do not have it delivered unless you are bedridden. punp your own gas. get a dog and walk it everyday.       there s so much a person can do to stay young at heart and have an active life. the bible promises 120 years to everyone  some have made it longer than that - make it a goal!
@georgia francis  i don t agree that the bible teaches we will live 120 years  my understanding is that genesis 6 3 is referring to days til the flood  but yes to all the rest! and my step grandma is 93 now but declining a little. she s like the adopted grandma to the kids she nannied for years.
awesome advice!
i had a double mastectomy  horrible operation. they sent me home same day  i was in shock. i was so angry  could not care for myself. god have mercy on us  please make away to expose and purge these demons from the human race.
i would look into supplement and herbs.  they have changed  and saved  my life  not pharma drugs.
oh my gosh  can i relate!  i am a gen-xer too and some of the experiences i have had with certain staff are unbelievable. i have seen some crazy things and the attitudes in some are too much. nursing can be such a toxic environment  not only brought on by other staff  doctors  admin. and certain patients  but also families.i remember getting a post-op hip surgery patient and immediately going to her room and getting her settled and comfortable once she arrived to the unit. i spent a good 10 minutes in there getting her comfortable and assessing her. my patient was still out of it  but vitals were stable including 02 sat and she was fine. i followed the unit protocol. that unit was awesome  like a well-oiled machine.  after settling my patient  i went into another patient s room and just got busy. about 10 minutes later  the patient s husband came to the floor and asked to see the nurse for his wife. i was that nurse of course. he immediately yelled at me for  ignoring  his wife and said that i did not see her at all since she arrived to the floor. i kindly explained that i was just recently in there for about 10 minutes and did everything already  including a full assessment and that she was fine. well  that wasn t good enough. he asked for the charge nurse  who was a weak beta male who had no backbone and only trusted the husband. he too berated me unnecessarily and only supported the irrational husband saying that i  should have not ignored the patient.  huh     i didn t ignore her  and in fact i was immediate!!!!! i asked to speak to that beta charge nurse in another room and explained that i saw that patient immediately after she was brought to the room and did everything and that she was resting comfortably. he asked  well then why is that husband so upset and saying that you didn t see his wife   hell if i know    he still seemed to favor the husband over me. it was so bizarre. i felt like it was a twilight zone moment.  so  you can do your job perfectly  but work around toxic people who just don t get it. one final part to the story is behind the curtain  the patient had a roommate and a few quiet  family visitors. they heard everything and after all was said and done  when that husband left  they came out of the woodwork and defended me  only to me though. they did not speak up for me in front of the husband or charge nurse  perhaps because they were too fearful   but it would have been nice if they did. they said  we witnessed everything and you were treated so unfairly by both of them.  they said  we saw that you came in right away  helpful to that patient and cared.  in the meantime  my patient was still in a deep slumber  sleeping like a baby. she had no clue what just transpired. i ll never forgot that moment and how awful it was and how defeated and gaslit i felt.
if that doesn t scream the bottom line has nothing to do with health.
exactly!  it is all about the money.
that push to use the word  client  has been used to categorize patients  prisoners  residents  recipients of aide services into an umbrella term.  as if  to make it impossible to distinguish these people from 1 another.  there s different levels of care between these individuals  there s differences of character types between patient vs prisoner   accordingly doled out treatments   security.  to lump these people into the same category is appalling   incorrect.
i remember that same concern when the words to describe hospital facilities transformed from health  care  into health  authority . paradigm shift.
thank you soooooo much patriot nurse for making this video and saying exactly what us nurses who know the truth have been telling everyone. keep preaching and telling the truth! 100  to everything in this video
we need to return the threats with legal threats and inquiries about whether their institutions are receiving fundings and grants that violate the stark laws and present conflicts of interests creating medicare and insurance fraud and malpractice  and that in the event of averse effects and consequences of their actions  they will be held accountable as private individuals for malicious behavior.
how true this is. we need to try to stay as healthy as possible i ve had two nurses tell me you don t want to end up in emergency room room nowadays that s beyond disturbing and sad. will be keeping you in my prayers that you continue to feel better. wishing you a blessed new year thank you pn i appreciate you beautiful   .
i have elderly relatives in their  60s and  80s. one will have to get a heart valve repaired next year  the other one will have to be starting at home dialysis. intermittent fasting and low carb eating helps their conditions  but it won t work forever. i m absolutely terrified of having to deal with the hospitals and taking them in for surgery. i m in my late 30s and i don t expect to live to be their age because i fear the hospitals more than death. the stress of taking care of them and dealing with our nightmare of a healthcare system is taking its toll on me  and i m sure it s taking a toll in ways i can t even see yet. i had covid in january of this year. the health impact was nothing compared to what s going to be coming down the line for me in the next 10 to 15 years.
does sharing this on media like fb put tpn in danger of being removed   i would love to share videos like this because i feel that she has a very important message here  one that everyone needs to hear.  great information on this video.  i am particularly interested in hearing how the medical system is breaking down--it makes it more urgent to get our health in better condition and avoid what treatments they have to offer us.
i haven t been to the doctor since i was 17  5 years ago  and my health is better as a result of it. i choose to live as natural and clean as i can  i don t need any needles in my arm  or poison pills in my stomach. god bless you pn!
can confirm all of this. while at an urgent care dealing with a broken finger  the doctor warned me ahead of time saying she couldn t set it because  there wasn t enough time   mind you it was 3 pm. i asked why that was and the reply was shocking ...  because i can t do it all. there is no one working with competence right now. unless you want to be dressed up by the noobie.    i took my chances and said sure. they couldn t wrap a fucking bandage. my finger is a bit crooked now and gets sore easily.  after 200 dollars and a swift kick out the door i just was thinking to myself.  damn  what a worthless effort  i could tell the head doctor wanted to help but was too slammed. i get it 14people for 1 doctor   but people work there that can t make a splint   made me really rethink some shit.
happy new year and godspeed  patriot nurse.  thank you for everything  that you ve done over the past years.
talking to a canadian doctor i got an insiders view of the american for profit hospital system.  in the u.s. hospital where he worked  he was required to request excess procedures in order to boost profits.  after a year he went back to canada where patients come before profits.
graduated nursing school in 1994. you are    on point!it breaks my heart but the  days of empathic nursing are over  is true  hospitals medical entities should have a sign   enter at your own risk. when my elderly mother had cv in 2021 i literally nursed her 24 7 to prevent her from going into the hospital out of sheer fear that she would not survive an inpatient stay d t negligence in the new establishment. god help us
i was in the hospital for 3 days and it was horrible the person next to me in the bed throw a family get together at 3.am and the nurses didn t stop it because of their race.i was lying in bed pretending to be asleep because their was 2 young men there and they kept coughing loudly trying to wake me .there was a portable pot beside my bed  no bathroom in the room i couldn t use it because of the 2 men there you could see through the curtains my husband complained about my treatment after i left .
my son is a minor by law and can not make decisions for his health care because he was 15.  they asked if he had the covid shot and we said no.  they offered it and i said no.  the nurse told me he was old enough to decide for himself.  i said i brought him here and i will bring him home if you won t listen to me.  she asked him if he wanted the covid shot and he said no.  then she put he was 18 on his file and said he could get blood products even though my husband  myself and my son said no blood products.  i told the doctor about the nurse and we got a different nurse.  after that  i told the office and the billing department that since my son is such an adult that they don t want to listen to me about his care  i will not be paying for it.  i never received a bill and neither did my son.  they pulled this crap with my daughter too and the minute i bring up since they are such an adult you can bill them even though by law you can t they do not bill me.
i appreciate your faith  honesty and courage! i moved out of montana for the soul reason that there is a surgeon in wyoming with a very poor reputation but an excellent track record. i need to take advantage of modern technology to continue working and provide for myself and family.  i ve been working to avoid a spinal surgery for 20 years plus. as a combat veteran who served over seven years as an air born ranger  it makes me sick that the va is so incompetent that  they tell me my injury is nonservice related. i half to do something  i m no stranger to pain  but there comes a point where it doesn t matter how tough you are. thank you for speaking the truth!a men! injured or not rangers lead the way! god leads the rangers and america needs woman like you!
i ve been retired for almost 20 years now and i ve never experienced the adamantly of registered nurses demanding i have a nurse come to my house for a home visit.  when i tell them that i currently do not need a nurse to visit me at home  they ask me   why not  your insurance pays for a monthly home nurse visit.   i just refuse to have a nurse come to my house just because my insurance will pay for it.  i don t currently need this service  but i feel as though they re demanding me to accept this service because they call me every month...sometimes once every week  even though i tell them that i don t require the service currently.  i honestly am starting to feel harassed.
you speak the truth. been working in hospitals most of my career. i have to stay quiet and can only speak to a very few coworkers on this. i have a religious exemption. luckily my hospital system accepted it. they didn t want to but i heard so many of us put them in - they wouldn t have been able to keep the hospital open safely without us. btw they are still requiring it. my sister just got a job in the same system as me and was forced to get the vax. she didn t want it. sad. i m so sad about all of this. so i am leaving my employer. however  now have taken a job in academia. they are pushing the jab and the boosters! omg  it never ends. my current employer did not push  to mandate  the boosters! when will this end
i m so glad i started learning about natural medicine at about age 19. had a subscription of prevention magazine for many years. it s been about 40 yrs now. i know natural remedies work. it s well worth the research.
the hospital system killed my mother this year. and of course nobody knew what the other person was doing and nobody had any accountability
as a certified nurse aide i totally agree with what you are saying. honestly i saw a big shift for the worse with the administration of the  affordable care act  which is anything but. the writing was on the wall when people were referred as clients consumers and not patients.take care of yourself pn and thanks!
i took my 16 yo daughter in to the er on a weekend when the regular doctors office was closed. she had what looked like a bullseye rash on the back of her leg and had an allergic type rash that now covered her entire body. we suspected a tick bite and wanted to have her tested. the doctor wanted to do a nasal swab for the vid. my daughter said no. she told me that goes against protocol. i told her it was still no. she got mad  ripped off her ppe  threw it in the trash and said  i guess there s no sense in trying to convince you to give her the then.  then she stormed out the door. a few minutes later a male nurse came in and proceeded to open a nasal swab package. i said   what do you think you are doing   he left. they sent us home with paperwork saying we were required to quarantine because we refused the test. after all that we couldn t my daughter s tick panel results because in maine they passed a law that parents are not allowed access to their child s medical information once they reach 13. the only way to get it is for her to go to the doctor and that wasn t happening.
glad to see you back! praying for your continued increased strength. love you!
nurse 32 years. i quit doctors 10 years in. 67. no meds. i see a naturopath as needed. and that s rare.  just found my dream job yesterday. they ll take my exemption.  i ve been like a fish out of water for the last year. happy to go back to work.
@maggie b  i m glad to hear that  i am currently looking to find a natural health advisor myself as well  not many around sadly so i just learn these things myself for now.
@maggie b  thank you for the information and compliments  i really appreciate it  all good things come from god!
@isaac  he gave us everything we need  in nature.
@maggie b  that is the truth!
i m 75 and have not been to a doctor in 15 years and quit the vaccine charade 25 years ago.    i suppose that at some point i may need a good doctor  know where i can find a good doctor  i don t.  oh well  i ll stick to my herbs which has keep me healthy for many years and when it s time for me to leave this world  i ll do it on my terms.
@itsopinion  i m so happy to hear that  don t let them fool you into their industry  they will grind you up and spit you out  stay close to god and his natural resources for health as much as you can.
@isaac  you as well my friend  i won t let them kill me  not saying they won t try lol.
@itsopinion  ditto!!
i recognized the b.s. when i was young too  back in 1989. i would go every fews years for a cbc  now i wonder if that s even worth much.  on rare occasions i would go to the e.r. for something i was unsure of.  since i took patriot nurse s clases in 2015  not once. i really listened  learned  and followed up with her recommended further self education. i highly recommend patriot nurse s in person classes if you can  otherwise  you can do them online. and  her older video playlists are a pure treasure.
lol  you got the last laugh!!!!   good on you for standing up for your rights!
a year and a half ago i took my husband to er for chest pain. he has a stent from 11 years ago so i wasn t gonna take any chances making an appointment with the va for a stress test etc. they did all the blood work and a chemical induced stress test  which was extremely painful and nauseating  duh!   the cardiologist told him it wasn t his heart it was pancreatitis. all the questions i had got shot down or explained away. they sent him home with meds for his stomach which he probably had an issue with but two weeks of continuing to have pain and couldn t walk five yards from the car to the house and a middle of the night episode we took life flight to the er. he has an additional stent that opened a 99  blockage. they weren t going to even do an angiogram unless he submitted to a cv test they said even if he tested positive to cv they would stent him but if he didn t submit to the test they wouldn t. omg! what a nightmare and the va refused to pay for life flight even though we are an hour and fifteen minutes away from the nearest hospital! in the midst of this i had a spike in bp with palpitations  stress related i m sure  and i fainted so went to a different hospital to get checked out. they were great in the er no mask no pressure. talked me into spending the night for additional tests. then things changed  it was no more hospitality central. it was were gonna shove this thing up your nose tomorrow morning before we do anything. i refused and fought and argued! then i was quarantined and my husband couldn t come in. i was so stressed! didn t sleep all night! they sent several nurses to argue with me about taking the test although they said we don t think you have cv it s just our protocol.  i demanded my discharge papers and left! protocol over patient needs does not fly with me! we will never go back! i feel like i have a mild case of ptsd as a result of this ordeal. praying for an alternative for emergency services in the future.
i so believe that things and people come into your life for a reason and at the correct time.  very interesting video.  have had many of the experiences you mentioned.  i watched one doctor change in a 6 year period  last appt i told her i felt like i walked into a cult.  walked out  lost 60 pounds  no meds  changed my foods.  my inner peace is the most important thing in life.  god bless you.
i m 73 and in good health. i have taken care of myself for years.  years and years in the gym and healthy living have given good life.  i hadn t been to a doctor for over 30 years. when i turned 60 i made my first apt with an incredible  caring doctor. my first appointment included a 30 minute  talk   on my artitudes toward my health and my doctor. tests were done for markets. the next appointment he shared the results.  he never gave me the numbers. his cimment   your doing great. whatever you re keeping doing it. i have been.he has since retired and my new practitioner has never had a conversation with me but always tells me what tests i need. i simply say  no . she s not happy but i don t care. i think it s a matter of time if we don t take these tests your health insurance will not pay for anything going forward.  we re at a time we need a network of healthcare professionals that deal with our health  not diseases. thank you for this video. it has been shared wiith my friends to get the word into the public sphere.
you are so spot on! i bowed out of the healthcare industry prior to covid because of the crap that i had seen coming down the pipes so to speak. the pressures on me to give newborns not even 24 hours old 14 different vaccines. also to give medications with side effects that were so numerous and detrimental to others. i could no longer stomach it. this while i was 28 years in as a registered nurse and seeing the new nurses grads coming on the scene with even less knowledge and empathy required of them....
thank you. that was a very honest and truthful discussion about the current situation in healthcare. as a fellow nurse  i can vouch for what you say.
wow  i had no idea it was that bad. scares me because i have two elderly parents who are hard core lefties who take every jab that comes out. my whole family wanted to kick me out and cut me off for not taking it. in the end  i suppose they didn t because my parents wouldn t be able to pay their mortgage and other bills without me. not to mention all the household chores i have to do for them because they can t anymore. i have 0  chance of being able to convince them that medical professionals might not always have their best interests at heart. i will pray for their good health because that s all i can do for them. they refuse to listen.
i work as a med tech for a small independently owned  assisted living for the elderly facility. we had three of our senior and best med techs quit because of stress covid burnout. the two are cleaning in the afternoons for a local school. less stress and better benefits. the other is now taking care of her grandmother. she left because the  stress was so bad for her it was making her sick. when covid all started healthcare workers. we are now zeros. no wonder so many left.
patriot nurse you re an amazing woman. thank you so much for all that you do for everyone. there needs to be many more of us standing for the freedom  liberty  sovereignty and even health of all mankind. please stay strong and continue to keep up the good work. happy and blessed new year to you.
i am a retired rn who still entertains the idea that i am wasting my skills. however  when you talk i feel better and know that i do not want anything to do with the medical field. i do miss patients and caring for people  but i always had difficulty dealing with admin. let me get back to my watercolor world    .
experienced this with my husband a few weeks ago during a  required  annual physical  do the annual or we won t keep you as a patient   most of the time was pushing prescriptions and vaccinations none of which he wanted and it was obvious their care team was exasperated  with us and had an agenda
the same can be said for the education system.  even 20 years ago we had mostly excellent teachers.  today we have few.
thanks for the excellent description of what has occurred in our society. this will give us a heads-up on preparation for the future. this information is vital for our protection.
i seriously refuse to go to the er! but for now... i ve got a very good dr  that gives a dang. but if i have to go to the er  i m treated like pure crap. and i nor anyone deserves to be treated this way. it s very wrong.  i had surgery in sept 22 . the pre-op nurse was just as livid as you are right now. and she absolutely made her frustrations very clear. about the financial part of the healthcare system. and what s got all of these hospitals   soo screwed up.. and all i could do was to completely agree with her about her frustration
i love this video i shared it with many of my family and friends and you re right on the money i m sorry to hear you re sick i can empathize with you i got this virus four weeks ago i m 74 years old and it comes and goes left me very weak i m starting to get a little concerned i m doing everything i can holistically and just taking basic meds and my insulini do wish you the best i am a retired nurse myself so i understand everything you re saying
i am very aware of the slow destruction of the medical system unfortunately my kidneys  went on strike this summer and i am tied to dialisis. 3 time a week a highly paid tech puts large needles in me and filters my blood.   this is paid by medicare to the tune of 80k a year.at some point in the future  this largess  will evaporate. i have already found the cost overseas is about 1 20 of here and by cdoctors trained here in the usa. what frosts me is the 300   markup of products used by folks like me and the   industrial   medical care i am reciving.i have seen upclose  personal exactly what you have described  and am trying to put together some sort of stand alone system to survive whats coming. this will involve home hemodialisis and the biggest stock of filters i can lay my hands on.oh well i guess this is how i get to spend the rest of my  retirement life....dealing with a decaying medical system
my esthetician who does my facials is a former icu and er rn. she said she had enough. so after 25 years in nursing  she went to beauty college. she still treats her clients like patients and does a wonderful job but she says her stress level is so much better. while i love what she does for my skin with her hydrofacials  it is a loss to the healthcare in our area. she is a wonderful  caring person but i understand her need to improve her quality of life.
they have seriously lowered the standards for nursing. a friend just took her boards  you pass at 75 .!! when i graduating nursing school in 1982 things were so different. it s scary what i see working in hospitals today. god bless you pn for all you do.
i do all i can to not go to a hospital or medical office. as a certified lymphologist i know how to keep my immune system healthy and know how to step up my healing efforts...i have invested in a really good anatomy book to use as a reference...and have some training in herbals  essential oils and do have some medical supplies that i can use in emergency situations. and strive to be as careful as i can to not get injured. including but limited to prayer.     @thepatriotnurse i have a pdf sheet of basic instructions on the activation and care of the lymphatic system that can and will help prevent you from  catching  a cold or getting sick...would love to send that to you.
considering that a suture removal appointment last week apparently was a bust  as i m still removing my scalp sutures  myself- i find trusting these people with anything more significant than that is something i just don t think i can or will do.  this video is heartbreaking  but good to know. thank you.
and bravo to this person that got out of the matrix.
oh thats interesting  our nurse practitioner left our unit when the viral stuff started to go run a health spa instead. botox injections  line fillers  cash pay and no insurance nonsense. we still havent been able to replace her 2 years later.
@jeep nj  good  good good  i enjoy any report of anyone leaving the matrix.
i m not in medical.. i m just a dumb retired welder but i have made these same observations and have screamed it from the rooftops.. i m glad to hear that i have been on the right track.. it s good to he validated in that i m not misguided in the leadership i hold of my family and community
i remember when the v1r s first hit in 2020  many healthcare wrkrs that i ve known for 20 yrs bought into the healthcare lies shift that was happening. i was very sad to see this and some were my close friends  came against me bc i wasn t on board with this shift. homeopathy works great but take longer. joette calabrese has a great website too
as the only nurse at my facility to refused the experimental jab  religious exemption   who also refused to inject anybody in the rolling clinics...i see so much less care being given  because  honestly the nurses are overwhelmed! our rural er has 11 rooms  10 monitored   1 on room  which is used as overflow  and two hallway beds  usually occupied with psych holds awaiting transfers . we get bogged down because of delays in transfer to higher level of care. other campuses are swamped. it takes hours to get a bed. if we have an mi in progress  and transport is available and the stars are in alignment....the patient has a chance to get to a heart authorization. i had a patient wait 7 hr for transport with an ascending and descending  aortic aneurysm...no air or ground because of fog. i was terrified he would code! god was watching over him...he actually went to a large hospital outside our system that had one of the only 2 physicians in this state that was available and qualified to do his surgery. god was watching over that man. he survived as far as i know.
this video was so helpful and confirming. we have 4 total care children  now adults  that we adopted as babies. they are tube fed only. we learned today that their insurance which for all these years past has paid for their enteral milk supplies  now wants them to have a new swallow study done to determine that they still need to be fed this way.  i have know for many months from reading articles on our state s insurance etc. that something of this would come eventually. we are not going to have the studies done  as i told the insurance person  and that it was ludicrous for them to implement this new rule.  we are seeing other issues for their care come about and have been making changes for the day  of which we believe will come  that there will be a complete end to the resources their insurance pays for now.  i have recipes for making their foods that will go through their tubes  healthy and organic as i can.  my personal view is that the ones in power now and their view on population control is the elderly and ones as our children do not  give  anything to the system  they only suck out  therefore  ...... losing them is no consequence to them.  thank you for this video and all the needed information of encouragement. in joy
as a 30 year rn  i am not proud of my former profession. the staff left in the system at this time  imho  are the dregs  the ones who can be bought.  i do my best to avoid hospitals at all costs.  in canada there is a big push toward convincing people in need to consider suicide.  i am so appalled and saddened.
what you said about people and situations keeping you sick is true for me! realized that recently. so now moving forward and making changes so i can emotionally  spiritually get better then prayerfully my body will follow to heal the rest of the way
pn  i found this absolutely informative. i had my suspicions from the experience some family members have had in the past few years. i would like to know how to safely get off of a low dose blood pressure medicine. my resources are very limited these days. it s the only one i m on now after getting off all the rest of the meds. believe me  it s great and a true blessing.
i totally agree with you. i had broken my femur and a right arm. the leg needed surgery. this snotty arrogant anesthesiologist wanted me to have a spinal. she was abusive when i told her i wanted to be put out.  finally  after continual harassment  i told her i had scoliosis  and a spinal was not an option. you are correct with the lack of empathy... it was the worst experience of my life.  i told a hospitalist to get the f out of my room after overdosing me with heparin. the list continued. by god s grace  i am alive to tell the story. how many other patients are not capable of being their own advocate or have family to do so.
first off  i want to thank you for being a voice of warning. i have been fortunate enough to have critically thinking parents. i am also blessed to have a dad who listened    still listens  to talk radio. back in 2012 13  14   my dad listened to jack stockwell in the mornings. jack would talk about politics  but he would also talk about health -the forbidden knowledge people have inside of them if they only understand that they can be in control of their own health.  in addition to this mindset  jack stockwell promoted whole food  nutritional supplements from a company called standard process. upon hearing this and other non invasive treatment  i felt the urge to try it out and become a patient at jack stockwell and associates.as someone who has been born with a congenital heart condition  i ve had my fair share of doctors  nurses  and staff. with the pharmaceutical hospital  it  feels more like i want to roll my eyes almost the entire time  along with groaning  all while enduring the experience.     however  during my visit  and visits since  i was surprised how different not only their treatments were  but the atmosphere itself!   now whenever my mom goes to pick up supplies from their office or whatever i have an appointment myself  i actually look forward to seeing them!  so when you mentioned about the different in atmosphere  i am already there!   not sure how you feel about masks  unless using them for construction or during surgery  but whenever i went to jack stockwell s office  they didn t care if we had a mask on or not.  in fact according to a few radio show episodes  jack mentioned about how he wanted to groan and tell people to stop using them because except for large particles  they don t work or benefit! . as for the hospital and associating clinics   this year in october in fact   they still required masks! i understand that transplant patients might need one  but if people did just fine before covid lockdowns  and technology should be improving right    then why keep up the mandate ! oh yeah  virtual signalling and never getting back to the old normal. honestly  i don t think they re a new normal. just a  new .    oceania has always been at war with eurasia!   1984
thank you  we have been praying for you and glad you re feeling better!
i saw a marked difference with the affordable care act passage. you are very correct about the measures the health industry takes to limit lawsuits and for the bottom line. as far as my recent medical care experiences  i ve been satisfied. i suffered total hearing loss in my left ear on september 21  2022. i went to a doc in the box the next day and my doctor h. evan dingle m.d. saved some of my hearing by immediately prescribing oral prednisone. he referred me to an ent which saw me 4 days later. they praised him for his quick action. after both oral and injected prednisone treatments   i ve regained some volume and now have 4 percent word recognition  which is better than nothing.
this was talked about almost 2 decades ago and it was unimaginable that something like this can happen.  it s a shame that we continue to forget our past and repeat these tragic errors because  our government would never do anything like this...    why would our government do anything like this...   and the most popular sheep quote   this could never happen in america! .  be prepared because this government will kill you and your loved ones without a care in the world.  once this last sentence is realized  things will turn around for the better.
i find it horrifying that so many have no conscience  i ve seen some nurses actually laugh or enjoy when they do something wrong
stay far away from hospitals. if you absolutely have to go then please always have a family member or friend stay with you.
thank you for sharing this.  so true.  we need an alternative system.  frontline doctors is one group that has started to do that.
i m an rn in new york  but the last few years  mom  has been my sole title. the kids are moving out now  and i want to return to the work force. what are some alternative careers you would recommend   i also have marketing  design and writing experience. thank you for this video. you have confirmed everything i had suspected.
thank you patriot nurse. you are spot on. my dr. put me on ozempic for diabetes. 2 weeks later started having debilitating migraines. she said it could not be the ozempic. short story  6 months later  neurologist  ct scan  mri  mra  blood work. i took myself off ozempic. 6 weeks later  the migraines quit. the dr can t even list it as a side effect  because the manufacturer does not recognize it as a side affect  so in my chart it is listed as an allergy.
myex husband  we have a good relationship went to the er with severe abdominal pain after waiting at home for 11 hours thinking it would go away.  thankfully he finally went to the er. he waited from 5 30a.m til 2 30pm to finally see the surgeon after cat scan and bloodwork showed appendicitis.  he also had a umbilical cord hernia that the surgeon fixed along with taking the appendix out. surgeon told me he would probably stay the night.  however the nurses in recovery told me they didn t have the help and they discharged him 4 hours later.!! he just turned 58 that day and thank god he had no complications after coming home.  i can t believe they didn t even keep him 1 night.
it s nice to see a woman drop straight truths   i think w the education revamp that has to come   cna and nursing classes should be available to start in 8th or 9th grade.  also other living needs jobs careers to combat the technologically destroyed generations that have been intentionally dumbed down and made numb.
i noticed instead of seeing doctors  we re seeing nurses taken over. all my nieces and nephews are all going to school for nursing  and they re all good kids  smart and kind. my one niece has been a nurse for five years now.
never put yourself down  you sound great to me!
doma ding
been hearing a lot about that on twitter.  coming soon to the usa.
this is shocking  outrageous and terrifying!!!
yes  i retired from nursing two months ago.  we were so short-staffed they hired contract nurses to work for  75 hour while the state employees were paid less than  30. i helped orient these new nurses and was appalled at their lack of knowledge and desire to care for the patients.  they came for the money and truly were the ones that no other hospital would have hired!  i couldn t stand it anymore.  could never effect change even while working as an assistant director of nursing!  uppers never took me seriously.  i ll be 64 on january 16  2023.  i took early retirement  now living on meager savings and social security.  however  i am no longer stressed  and i am truly happy.  i m living a simple  healthy  frugal lifestyle.  just praying i never have to be admitted to a hospital where they put money above true patient care.  i rather die at home.  so sad  isn t it
this is shocking!!
@sabrina devol  i am in the same boat fellow rn here i am learning herbal and alternative methods now we must be our own doctors as big pharma has corrupted most of the medical staff left.
@goodfigtree  well said!!!!   yes  and god is testing all of us right now -- will we choose good or evil    and those who choose evil will be spewed out of his mouth!    god bless you.
@repent  jesus is coming soon!   thank you. your user name reminds me of what a friend said recently. he shared his observation that the word repent is rarely heard in  mega  church sermons   a word that is paramount to our salvation through jesus. you re sharing a vital message with your user name!  god bless you too.
@goodfigtree  thanks for the encouragement  blessings to you!
wow! any idea what caused the sudden hearing loss
@laura nilsen  the use of prednisone steriods indicates that was an immune system attack. and my guess would be that s autoimmune condition has a connection to the covid injections. note  it wasn t an infection of some sort because anti-biotics were not prescribed or not the key treatment.
@lauranilsen8988 hearing loss can be an adverse reaction to the mrna shots
@terri pebsworth  thank you for that assessment.  it makes a lot of sense.
@kelly smith  that information is starting to come out now.  i remember reading reports about it.
oh for sure agree with this
@kelly smith  yes. i ve read that.
@terri pebsworth  makes total sense. i figured it was something pharma did.
sadly  i have friends who absolutely refuse to believe something is wrong and carry on as they did 10 years ago. some have issues now they didn t have 3 years ago.
thank you! thank you!patriot nurse for highlighting this! i ve been a victim of exactly what your family mbr. experienced. i was admitted for trauma surgery   possibly prt of a study w no proper informed consent  long story short i was treated with inadequate medication. i had very good insurance. made no difference in my treatment they gave me alternative meds in lieu of appropriate medications which increased bleeding   6.5 units . i now have medically induced ptsd frm this horrid experience! please be aware we are now rationing necessary meds under the guise of a crisis. there is an agenda at play since the  16 cdc guidelines  reminiscent of covid pandemic g ls ! listen to pnshe s spot on! ps see the cpp community on twitter  suicides are escalating   similar stories are rampant.
i had a bone marrow transplant in 2020 at mskcc.  the stark difference between then and now is mind blowing.  people went from kind caring  rarely a rude nurse or doctor  to now  everytime i go there some rn or pct or reception is arguing with me  hurting me or just a pure attitude.  i don t want these people to touch me.  i m out. cancer free. i m heading to nursing school outside of nyc. i am a healer and know i have to be the change  start alternatives.  everyone please take care of yourself.  look to alternative healing modalities as well.  it s not safevoit there.
i see wisdom  professionalism  and a deep deep care for humanity. wow. i m sharing this as it was just shared with me today.
this past year i have made so many tinctures for my family. it is incredibly how much medicine can come from a little garden
i was in nursing school in 2013 when my father got deathly ill. i stopped school to go care for my father. during that time i saw an ugly political side of the medical community. the doctors and administration i had to deal with definitely had a god complex.due to this i decided to not continue in nursing. previously i was a surgical tech. while doing my training i saw doctors refuse treatment to a homeless man who had been hit by s car. because they knew he didn t have insurance and they would not get paid...what we saw in covid  just showed us the massive lack of compassion  and the money hungry greed that drives the industry. it s been there for a while. it just finally showed it s ugly head to the public.i do not trust our medical system. period. i m trying to manage as much as i can via homeopathic herbal medicine...
after decades of pain  i m scheduled for back fusion surgery in a hospital in a couple months  although i m on a cancellation list after initially schedule for mid january in a private recovery center until the surgical team discovered my sensitivities to anesthesia   rx pills . i m  for god s protection  miracle  and healing!
i keep telling people that we don t have a health care system our medical institutions are nothing more than a disease identification and disease management systemthey aren t interested in  health  or  care if they were a things would be dramatically different once you realize the difference between these two  you ll understand what you must do to protect yourself and family and begin to take things into your own hands!
i just had a heart attack and two surgeries....  hospital got a c minus at best.  nurses  except for one  were outstanding.  however  as soon as they found out that i had not had a flu shot  or the other one  i was labeled  non compliant  and given a hard time by a few of the staff.  fortuneately  the surgeon was a prince  and did an amazingly fine job of putting my heart back together.  but all of the attitudes you spoke of were just under the surface.  i just  as some people would say  got lucky....i give the thanks to god - i was blessed.
thank you patriot nurse. and god bless you. may the lord keep you safe and healthy and strong in these troubling and darkening days.
you are so right patriot nurse. i m 62 and i ve been watching the medical field go downhill for the last several years.
a couple months ago  my elderly uncle was transported via ambulance to the er  we thought possible heart attack. all the tests and scans checked out fine yet he was in extreme pain. they gave him morphine and fentynal. the er dr said it was obvious he was in pain and the fact that he had never been to the er or a hospital stay.  hours went by. nothing. finally  i asked to speak to the er dr . the nurse returned and said the er dr had left for the day....and she didn t know who was replacing.  what! ! ! my uncle refused to stay. he passed away at home the next day...i am not a medical professional and i used to count on the professionals to be knowledgeable and know how to handle these situations. now  i m not so sure....
well you just explained what happened to me when i went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago.  thank you!
i got hit by a car  tore my meniscus  tweaked my back and hip  rushed to the hospital  stayed overnight  received one pain pill  was discharged and received no pain medication  was told to take tylenol as needed. was hurt enough to be off work for a month  sent to see an orthopedic doctor  still am on tylenol. this is inhumane.
behavioral health nurse here. i just went back to work after about 9 months of trying to start a business but it s not paying the bills. not even close. i ve only been a nurse for 10 years  4 years as a traveler  but seeing what i m seeing from my peers is downright terrifying. i always heard that nursing was not like it used to be  but i didn t understand what people meant until i started working. nobody cares or understands what a work ethic is. nobody pulls their own weight  everyone passes the buck  nurses are lazy and don t have any commons sense  and the patients suffer. it s ironic that you bring attention to this generation being educated by screens because i was part of my program s first  hybrid learning  class back in 2009 to have lectures online. we were basically experimented on as we were taught through powerpoint presentations and had no interaction with our instructors. if we had questions about the material  we had to message them. i couldn t believe they were teaching us how to be nurses online  and i frequently complained about it. i can only imagine how bad nursing education has gotten since then and i see the results of this firsthand with my peers.
my sis-in-law is a licensed herbalist   nutrionist  and takes great care of herself but has sadly suffered from hashimotos for years. she ended up in the er and was told she has cirrhosis of the liver. she doesn t  drink! she does have fatty liver disease.they re telling her she needs a liver transplant and are making her go through a bunch of tests. thing is  they refuse to even put her on the list if she doesn t submit to a number of poison jabs including clooooved  2 of them .she is of course against those particular poisons so may very well be out of luck. she s going through the tests but it s  not looking good for her if it does turn out she needs a transplant. they will just let her die. they ve already made that much clear. as part of their policy  they had a social worker do a zoom call with her and the guy was so intrusive.. at one point  he started commenting on all the books he noticed that she had on her bookshelf immediately behind her. he must have zoomed in because he was giving her much more detailed info than she realized he could see.she is well informed and educated  a licensed nutritionist and herbalist with clients. her questions are always well founded. once one doctor realized that she was into natural medicine  they noted her file and now every doctor she has to deal with brings it up  giving her a hard time and seemingly trying to back her into a corner with their coercive questions  seemingly trying to get her to admit that she s an anti-v.e.r. she s not  btw  and makes sure to tell them that when they push.i myself have suffered from crohn s disease for most of my life and now have 4 types of arthritis. i ve been into natural medicine for many years and i m on a strict regimen of vitamins and nutrients  from the coimbra protocol  which is helping me a lot. i can personally attest from all the doctors appointments and hospitalizations i ve had that our healthcare system is quickly deteriorating.the horror stories i have! the doctors don t like being questioned or challenged. they seem to get personally offended no matter how respectful you are  if you merely dare question what they ve told you to do. i have many years experience with my complicated health history and have done a ton of research  having also consulted with many doctors even out of the country. i am not an ignorant schmuck yet they love to treat me as one. i ve had to file formal complaints against 2 of my doctors because of the lies they ve put in my file in retaliation to my daring to question their orders  orders that would have killed me if i had followed through. it s unbelievable the things i have to deal with  and which people in general have to deal with. i pray to god i never lose my mind as i get older because if i do  i m toast.
i just retired.  i worked in a subacute rehab centre for seven weeks at the height of covid.  a couple of nurses ended up getting sick so of course we were even more short staffed.   it was hard enough  no good computer training   before the don decided to open our facilities back up.  5 clear facility wide tests in a row   i walked in to 29 patients  i worked nights !!   my aunt by marriage just lost her husband due to complications from diabetes.  he refused to stop eating crap and then to move after his leg procedure.  he got pneumonia and passed suddenly when we thought he was going back to rehab.  i truly believe that if we re given physical therapy  then we need to make an effort to help ourselves.
you re always a blessing. thank you for this  and all that you do. have a great new year!
i have been trying for years to   educate   my family on not to rely on modern medicine!!  i will have to just practice  for myself and anyone who will listen to natural healing advise  ...my suggestion is that you tead on all the natural healing books you can find and educate yourselves on all the healing properties that are right under our feet!
god bless you patriot nurse. you are most likely saving some lives. you are loved. keep up the good work!
i m curious if their social media posts are a bunch of selfies.i m curious how anyone things that learning from a computer is anything like having the hands on experience.hospitals have smells. there s unavoidable work involved to keep things clean and sanitary.we saw many times where nurses wouldn t clean their hands between patient rooms. food service workers had more sense of what cross contamination was than the nurses providing direct contact care.
i promise you there are a few of the good ones lefted.probley they might not be working due to critical thinking skills. no one would get a experimental vaccine which was not tested unless they had half a brain was fearful or intimidated to have to quit their job. unfortunately it s going to make a difference because those nurses have stood up all along and made a difference in our healthcare. i know what you mean a lot of nurses i worked with are taught differently now and it shows
i agree. i m an over 20 vet in the field  well  no longer in the field after the plandemic .  i saw plenty of nurses come out of school and never had inserted an iv  a urinary catheter  a ng tube  etc.  when i was in nursing school in the late 1990s  we had to do those things during our clinicals or we would not graduate.  we also had to know every medication our patients were on  what they were for and would get quizzed by the instructor as they stood there and asked you a bunch of questions about it.it s scary to think they hardly let nursing students get any hands on experience during their clinicals.  to call it clinicals and have the students just stand around and watch the nurses is just plain stupid  as it s the hands-on experience that makes the transition from nursing school to the real world so much easier.  glad your eyes are opened.  you must be one of those few that has real critical thinking skills.  just watch your back  as things are not good in that field anymore.  i m looking for something else to do and haven t figured it out yet  but can t say i trust the  system  any more than i can throw it.
meanwhile i have a 26 year old niece who  insists  on online learning only. these students are literally unable to function in the real  non-digital world
i went to find a new doctor recently. i have a chronic illness that i treat myself with herbs and vitamins and i see a rhumatologist that is retiring. the potential doctor said well the cdc say we can treat with only these meds   not the meds you are on.... after 20 years this is the only protocol that worked for me. i do not want different addictive meds. i left and never went back. it was disheartening... i will be treating myself.
it s crazy how fast things went when covid came about. it s like everything was pre planned. can you imagine if we put all that effort to progress instead of regression.
...in the healthcare and medical industrial complex...  that is the most accurate description of modern healthcare. thanks for all you do. zei gezunt.
your so right! i am a retired nurse and have seen this myself.
love you patriot nurse.. keep up the good work i really appreciate you spreading good messages. and i definitely am so glad to relay to others
i m 73 years old. retired nurse after 40 years in every are of nursing. i m appalled at the medical system now. most hospitals have medical students taking the place of staff doctors. the nurses know more than these students. scary!!! and infection rates in patients is multiplying rapidly. in some cases  the infections are so bad that the patient is sent home to die!!!! my god!!! what happened
what you describe is similar to what happened in my profession  k-12 education. at the time of the gates common core takeover teachers were forced to abandon the ethical standards of their profession. the good veteran teachers got pushed out. the young compliant teachers were retained.
i m so glad i found you. i know everything you re saying is 100  on target. thank you.
absolutely solid advice! the rift within our society has reached levels not seen by anyone currently living. i m patiently watching and waiting for the emergence of medical  and other professional  establishments where the adherents are committed to supplying true services where life is held sacred . i will resist funding or even dealing with people who believe infanticide and euthanasia of those deemed unproductive is okay.
i was fired when they mandated the shot last year  did two local travel contract across state lines and paid most of our debt off... my husband has been in and out of the hospital with a new diagnosis  i had to be on them like valtures.. i was kind and respectful  but i knew my stuff and told them exactly what was going on.. i even had to go up the line to get in during morning rounds bec they dont let visitors in until after bec i was the one who knew what the heck was going on ...
so glad you are in better health and back to releasing content .  blessings to you and yours.
dad died in late in a year just before covid.  he received good care.mom died mid 2021   her care was below standard.  they essentially advised us to let her die.  they left a shazam! shaped iv needle in her after getting her out of their hospital  the presence of which only the second hospice nurse discovered.  while still in the hospital  the resident bedpan nurse put the pan down backwards.my sibling wanted to go to the doctor for moderate  not life threatening  surgery.  i talked him out of it.  i couldn t shake the feeling that that one procedure would have killed him.
would love a franchised patriot nurse  one where the good retired nurses and docs teach your curriculum nationwide under your brand banner.
always providing good and relevant information. thank you!
i actually had a male nurse speaking and acting in a condescending manner while i was healing and walking with another nurse during respiratory therapy. i wanted to punch him in the mouth but i couldn t breathe lol.  love and prayers to you
i heard this recently.  my friend was sick and went to dr.  the dr wanted to do a covid test but my friend said no she didn t want it.  she said no several times but the dr got angry and said well i want it and you re getting it. my friend was so sick and flabbergasted with it that she didn t think to just walk out.  within a few sec the test was done.  it was negative! my friend knew she didn t have covid but the dr would it listen and did it anyway.
i pray we all have a happy new year  but my pragmatic side won t let me believe it.  we the people  have allowed a lot of pain to accrue. seems we thought we could just pass the bills to the kids.thank you for the knowledge you bring. have a safe new year.
you nailed it! the same is happening here in vancouver  canada      .  i have little respect for our health care system-  i ve seen too much esp over the past three years my body my choice.   my colleagues were fragile  emotionally weak and should know better   but they always excuse their actions because they have  bills  to pay  families to house  and new electric cars to buy no one values a human life as much as a new tesla. the system crumbles more and more each passing day.  they want to hire  foreign  nurses now.  nurses are always working short and stretched beyond and so  the health system has made them become angry and bitter. they want the system to fall apart  and so it is
do you have rheumatoid arthritis  or what
take patriot nurses clases for an overall knowledge and then you can do most things yourself
look for a holistic dr. of course depending on your insurance you will pay the brunt of the cost
absolutely!! you have to be your own health advocate  and i refuse pharma drugs.
i ve been a registered nurse over 20 yrs   she is absolutely right.  it is very upsetting to see what healthcare is devolving into.  do what you must..... stay out of the hospitals!!!
i was awaken to the true focus of medical care in america starting in 2012  after researching info and statistics about health and wellness as a health teacher   then receiving a medication for a sinus infection that caused stroke like symptoms.  then my journey down the wormhole of the great money grabbing machine.....with no benefits to me...it was horrifying how the doctor who prescribed the meds was no longer available for appointments   the pharmacy had no record of my prescription  3 years later  note  i only took one pill  woke up not being able to move my body  not being able to talk.after going to hospital getting no help  i through bottle of pills in garbage as soon as i got home...and then it took 3 weeks before i could slightly function to go back to work.  to this day  my loss of cognitive function still has not been fully recovered. my microbiome was destroyed. i went from being the healthiest person to major digestion issues.i am now a student of herbalism.  i have been studying and using herbs and natural techniques to treat any illness fir me and i m trying to teach my adult children as well  but they have not reached the level of awakening needed.
i went to my kindergarten granddaughters conference last year- and i asked her teacher 2 things. 1 was what did she know about the  new  sex education being taught in schools  i was asking primarily about 5 yr old grandaughter - i told her i had read on the early elementary sex education curriculum  grades k-3  1 providing accurate and appropriate info about sexuality. 2. giving students opportunities to develop their attitudes   values   and beliefs about sexuality. 3.helping students develop relationships and interpersonal skills   and 4. providing students instruction and practice in developing personaland sexual responsibility. that was day 1  day 3.had things like   shared sexual behavior a. touching   hugging   kissing b. to show love and share pleasure. this is only a tiny bit of what our babies are being taught.  oh yes this one too - on assertiveness c. parents sometimes override your rights and then - looking for help if parents aren t respecting your sexuality.  it s absolutely insane or dare i say satanic  this was from health education 2001   currently listed on my states board of education  she has been taught how to masturbate hygienically  her teacher claimed not to know anything about  that class  but if you need more detailed guidelines for developing this curriculum just go to the siecus web site for the pdf. my niece in ca had her 20 mos old daughter at a park   she said all the kids were dressed alike- no differences between boys and girls. and i will say this you d better not speak up unless your prepared to be read the riot act for your outdated thinking. this is in a state with churches every 2-3 streets  slight exaggeration  and it s not in the south.  so her teacher doesn t know anything about that class or the teacher   who i ve been told by my little one   is the best  the nicest and the funnest teacher.  one other strange thing to me is why most of the world uses the metric system and the usa doesn t    teacher shrugged her shoulders and said  i never thought of that . all the more strange because this woman is quite obviously intelligent and informed on everything else we spoke of.
@silvershades  meanwhile the schools are teaching little of the basic survival skills  reading  writing  and arithmetic.
pay no tax..
i have said for many years now that a medical advocacy group  retired or active dr s  nurses  paramedics  etc  should be started to help people  usually elderly  that don t have family member that can help with medical decisions.  the state provides this for mentally challenged and in state custody.
@shari mientus  i think ali schultz has started something sort of like that. advocacy is huge. i think the hospitals arrest you now  as you try to advocate. i m asking here to consider a self-reliance training that reaches every state under the auspices of patriot nurse quality and expectations. this network trains but maybe other services can spring from them...patriot nurse clinics    etc. i like the franchise model  where a network of small businesses are created.
@lon knight  franchisees lose licenses all the time. let the good guys make money  focus on all things health. starting here with education.  it is doable. i m not saying its easy to sustain.  it can be done. it takes the right culture.
@gina  where is ali schultz located   to me  if hospitals really cared about patients  they would should provide a non-hospital affiliated advocate!  but  i guess that would make too much sense!
retired bsn here.  agree!
@shari mientus  i ve replied 3 times here but  seems to be getting blocked or somefun. ali is in arizona. she founded hands for health and freedom.
then keep your home life safe and secure and happy.  no one can get to you inside your 4 walls as long as you protect it.  we re locked and loaded so we re safe.
we didn t teach god  standards to the younger generations and the chickens came home to roost in this godless nation. the father of this world seeks to steal  kill   destroy. seek god s guidance to keep you and your loved ones safe from this evil
this trend is also true in the ambulance 911 industry depending on where you live. that critical care at the scene is also impacted. the chain of medical care is in jeopardy. you will have less caregivers to respond to your emergency and will have less experienced caregivers to help you survive. the experienced caregivers know what has been happening  because they saw it first hand! mandating things was the breaking point.
prayers for your continued healing patriot nurse.
i m so grateful to have found and subscribed to the patriot nurse. such a beautiful and intelligent woman that cares enough to tell the american people the truth of what s going on in health care it s very sad.
i m a recently retired nurse.  patriot nurse is speaking the truth.  i know from experience.  healthcare isn t what it used to be.
i have no healthcare. i haven t had any for 30 years except medicaid when i was pregnant.  i m 63 now and surviving. i have learned everything that i can for free.  now  my health is going down even more. patriot nurse is right.    no money  no care.  no money  no new learning to take are of one s self and family.  learn everything you can!!! research everything you can!!!!  your own life depends on it. your family depends on you.  pray  trust god and do the best you can.
i am a nurse at a level one trauma center and agree with everything you have said. covid changed the landscape of healthcare and it will never be the same. i work in the operating room and listened to many surgeons advocate for the jab while i stood quietly and maintained my convictions. i was able to get a religious exemption and continue to work. the environment is unprofessional and hostile at times but i am still standing on my convictions and will not waver. i was prepared to walk if my exemption had not been granted. all glory to god for working it out.  it breaks my heart that so many medical professionals who chose not to get the jab have been disrespected and treated in such a bad way during the last three years  it did not have to be this way .  the damage that has been done to healthcare cannot be reversed. god be with us all and let s keep fighting for truth.
i ve followed you a long time  you re consistently genuine and amazing.
i have worked clerical in the er for 26 years.  i have not been jabbed.  i have consistently come against my leadership and given my dept head and dr ramin davidoff with my email against the jabbing of my coworkers and pregnant women with the harming of them all.  i have now been called a racist for speaking the truth about fentynal coming from china through the border.  i have been out on administrative leave and contacted by an eeoc atty for speaking the truth.  we are now handing out narcan to anyone who asks for it.
patriot  i agree  my wife got covid from me and would up with pneumonia. which resulted in me almost loosing her. the medical complex uses your emotions to get the desired treatments performed. in my case i wound up placing her on a vent  ended up with a tracheotomy later. she we in a medically induced deep sleep for 60 days. eventually she went to rehab which got her off the vent. what bother me the most is she still suffers from numbness in her hands  she got a bed sore on her coxix  spelling . after 12 months she still is in pain and not fully functional. this would have not happened if they floated her and braced her hands. i do not trust hospitals. fortunately we do have a pa we work with and see for basic medical.
former nurse here. i left years ago when i noticed this start to happen. i will never go to a hospital again. haven t been to a doctor in a decade and am doing fine
oh yeah! this is super real.. i had walking pneumonia and i was told that it was anxiety... i pushed back and got proper treatment and antibiotics. you re going to have to be so firm in advocating for yourself
our doctor we ve been with for 20  years decided that because we didn t get the covid a jabs  she didn t want to see us anymore for physicals.  my husband then had a heart attack a year later with 2 stents put in.  we live in an area where there are no doctors taking new patients and have a 2  year waiting list.  so we have been just doing tele doc visits offered through our insurance for any concerns and go to er for emergencies.
she tells the truth my elderly father in law was going septic after their demands to agree to ship him out to a hospital in another state  when i refused to do it they gave him antibiotics and sent us home  he collapsed spent almost a month in hospital it s a miracle he got well.
total truth on political weaponization and  protocols  for safety of licenses. i m a retired fnp  i left after the ocare began to kill my own ability to care for patients  and landed with a t12 fracture in april. in my day  that person got 1. xrays if they didn t already  2. set up for ct scan 3. set up for mri and 4. referral to neurosurgeon that day. so when that patient returned to the office in under 2 weeks they were pain free and back to participating in life because they were treated asap and could participate in healthcare. here i am. went to the er got a diagnosis of a small one. called doc for appointment. waited over a week. told well  that s the way the cookie crumbles almost literally by the doc. we have 2 acres  chickens  we helped feed the animals on the ranch next door  and brought them in when the neighbors were out buying hay or other feed. so i had to  ask for a ct scan and a referral to the neurosurgeon. the first ct scan was done backwards and had to be repeated. the second assistant in the ct set up didn t understand i couldn t raise my legs  that fast  and shoved the foam so hard i can no longer stand for longer than 3-5 minutes much less help with the chickens or ranch next door nor can i lay flat. i didn t get an mri for a month. it was another month before i got into the neurosurgeon s office and saw the np. she had me fitted with a brace which sent me through the roof in pain  to her credit she did say it would hurt but she didn t say i would be begging for death. when i told her she then said since i failed to keep it on for 12 weeks  and listen to these next two sentences and see if you can untangled them   i couldn t get kypho or vertebroplasty. i asked why. she said   you waited too long.       from april s er visit to september s  sayarnara   that is the no treatment i got. so  i am doing my own pt because i already know the pt in my area. and this doesn t include the  lets get an xray  and no you don t need a follow up appointment  for what i believe is a torn rotator cuff and or ac separation. so disappointed with the care i ve received  knowing what i would do to help my patients to the standard of care  beyond if i felt it necessary. oh  after covid that someone gave me  my heart rate ran from 40 to 160 and my bp all over the place  and the stand in doc said  take a mvi daily. not. kidding. totally inept medical care.
thank you so much for this video.  i have seen all that you are talking about.  i absolutely will never leave my husband alone in the hospital.
my wife of 43 years just died  she had spent a 6 weeks under the care of joe s hospital at rehab she could not breath  they called me saying they were sending her back to the hospital  so i ask can you send her to scott s hospital. at the new hospital within an hour they diagnosed pancreatic cancer. that was never uncovered by the joe hospital.  she had blood clots all over  which was indicative of many  jab people. my high iq wife never got that jab   but the md at joe s kept saying the cause does not matter the treatment is the same. if we had known earlier we could have brought her home to die sooner. i think that between medicare  insurance doctors make no decisions they just follow what is covered   know what they are not allowed to say. our brave new world.
i m retired. started working in a hospital 49 years ago. retired 10 years ago. did some limited volunteer work until 5 years ago. pn  you are quite correct. the larger a facility is  the more you will see this type of work environment. you can still get good quality care from smaller facilities  but those smaller facilities also have limits on what they can offer. i ve helped teach many students when they were on the floor for their clinicals. i hope those students will carry on in the best tradition of nursing  but they have an uphill battle.
i m a bluecollar steelworker.  yesterday   i met my new coworker who is was a  registered nurse at a major hospital in st louis. his pay was cut in order to insure the doctors got their  bonus . he s on our emergency response team.
i took my husband to the er for what appeared to be a rapidly growing tumor on the side of his face.  they were not even going to look at him for over a month before that.  we were put in the hallway because they said their were no rooms.  he had an indwelling catheter and a feeding tube.  after several hours they took him for a ct scan.  several hours later after me asking where the results were an er doc came and told me what i already knew.  hours later the doctor on call  who was also the doctor he was scheduled to see in that month appt  sent a resident to give the results.  midway through all of this i could see my husband was rapidly getting dehydrated.  they had done absolutely nothing as far as triage for him.  i asked the nurse for a syringe and some water so that i could give him fluids.  he did so and i kept him hydrated!  they refused to admit him for a biopsy and wanted me to take him home by ambulance and come back by ambulance when they could get around to doing it.  long story short.  i took him home.  we knew anything they did to treat the growth would just kill him anyway and he would be very sick along with it.  he was already non-verbal and the growth was growing daily.  he held on for a few more weeks waiting for our children from out of state to be able to get there and as soon as he said goodbye he was gone 2 days later.  the hospital has the gall to send me a bill for almost  300 for that trip.  they should be paying me.  i was the one who took care of him.  it s supposed to be the greatest hospital around and a teaching hospital at that.  what a nightmare.  i have saved all the meds he had from hospice and homecare for when i or anyone i know might need it.  i totally agree with patriot nurse s urging to take care of yourself and beginning to stock up on supplies.  we haven t seen anything yet.  if you don t know god on a personal level  i fear for your soul and body for what is coming.  i know where my husband is and can t wait to join him in heaven.  i hurt for all those who will be left behind to deal with this fallen world.
love your advice a billion tons.  thank you so much patriot nurse.
meadowlarklibrarys and intenet are both free to continue your learning only thing that is costly is buying the herbs for treatment plans. good luck be well.
@lon knight  thankyou  yes  that is what i am doing.. though i often cannot afford the herbs. i do the  best i can.  always use the internet and library for free    that is what i meant.
@meadowlark8  tome to start growing the herbs you find yourself turning to the most!
amen  this has even trickled down to affect emt s as well
as a kaiser member  i see what you are talking about  more and more. i just dropped my pcp of 10 years because he pawned me off onto some pain mgmt. program whose sole purpose is not the patients welfare for chronic pain  but the dea kaiser agenda for reducing opiods. i m a 71 yr. old man with 6 ortho surgeries 3 level cervical discectomy  two level lumbar discectomy  and two surgeries on my right foot  two heart attacks  the last one killed me and i was in a coma for 6 days on life support after a hypoxic episode  las  and various other medical issues. i have a 1.5 centimeter abdominal aortic anurysm and a 4.8 centimeter growth of some kind on my right kidney.  all they want to do is  monitor  them. so  being on opiods long term for chronic pain is the least of my worries. i have refused taking part in the pain mgmt. program and requested a patient advocate be at every video chat  on every phone call  and any physical visit.
this video is spot-on! healthcare has been corrupted beyond recognition .avoid going to er hospital alone  always have someone with you. if the situation allows  be prepared to leave if necessary  have an exit plan. any good caregivers left are working under tremendous mental physical pressure.be respectful  but stay alert  ask questions  insist on understandable answers.show appreciation for good care when it s provided! good caretakers need deserve our support.  we need them! assume ineptitude can will surface at any point    be prepared to quickly firmly react to it.  whenever possible  choose home care options.most importantly  do what you can to stay well!
people should request a paper copy of the agreement the hospital makes you sign electronically when you go in and read it. its quite surprising. some terms say you give permission for the hospital and doctors to make medical decisions on your behalf. you want to cross that out and attach your living will and health care proxy. also hospitals are calling the v a biologic so the electronic sign in might say you give permission to be administered with a biologic definitely want to cross that out.
i ended up taking a nursing job i thought i d never take.  surprisingly i really like it but i fear going into my hometown hospital for fear of their horrible care and being shamed for not taking the vaccine. but i m a lpn so i m expendable
thank you i appreciate the time and effort you put into making your videos . wish i had the kind of memory that would allow me to not only remember but put to good use the information from one of your video courses. i am the kinda person who needs hands on training  even your in person courses wouldn t be enough . i wish i had the money and you had the time and willingness to do one on one training but i don t and you probably don t either. pretty sure you aren t ever coming to california   even northern california to do one of in person training courses.   i guess that means i will have to do the best i can w o training.
yes. i just sent email to my state senators that there is not an ob gyn within 200 miles of my town asking them to work on this. i ve had a uti yeast infection most of the past year with 2 gp s and a np treating me and still can t resolve it. not typical for me. i m looking at 2 months waiting time for an appointment in albuquerque  plus a 400 mile round trip and a motel stay for one doctor appointment. i m actually thinking of moving to another country
thank you   all truth here   keep shouting the truth from the rooftop patriot nurse and  god bless you!
you are telling the truth. i cannot believe the questions the doctor asked. when i refused the boosters they asked why. i simply told them i felt is was unnecessary since they neither stop you from getting or giving covid and i d already had it once. listening to her report for her files she at least quoted what i said somewhat correctly. i need knee replacement and can t get an appointment with a surgeon until i have them  so i guess i won t be having surgery. it s nuts.
gonna have to take my hub to the dr. i fear he has subungual melanoma. his gp told him it was probably an ingrown toenail. i will not be satisfied until we get a biopsy. i read everything i could find on it he has 5 of the 7 signs of nail bed melanoma. it s black  growing  irregular shaped  nail deformity    but no hutchinson s sign - yet.edit  he thinks i m overreacting. it killed bob marley! but i learned that now it is less likely to result in amputation of the digit so
severely broke my ankle and required surgery on both side of my left ankle. mass health and cape cod hospital got my insurance  in place after the state  workers denied coverage. the care and specialist were excellent.  thank you all cape cod healthcare  and hospital.
thank you for this video  miss! the information you gave was noted and valued! god bless!
fabulous talk.  i m with you all the way.  i just had my insurance company send me a health survey and they marked it as  very important .  i m not going to respond.  i ve been going holistic for years. i just started drinking olive oil and balsamic vinegar every night.  i actually enjoy it and i just picked up straws so i can keep the acidity off my teeth. it s critical to not brush once you ve drank this potion  it will destroy your teeth.   i can feel things happening that are good signs and this one habit can do so many things.  i m only taking 1 medication and i want to go off it.  i think that s achievable.  thanks for confirming and saying everything you ve just shared.  you are wonderful.
left  nursing in 2019 before covid .    i believe the medical system is a house of cards .let them what they do best . destroy themselves. a new wave of health care is coming
patriot nurse  you couldn t be more right! i am a retired rn of many years and i absolutely concur with everything you said. i was medically retired before 2020 but i could not treat patients the way that patients are being treated now  including the jabbing  of people with a very dangerous untested in humans technology. i have been prepping for years and i am very grateful to have acquired dressing kits  surgical ppe9  gauze  bandages  iv bags and tubing materials for fracture casts and the basic monitoring appliances such as a bsl machine   a sats machine   bp  nebuliser  crutches etc. i have some medications for pain constipation   diarrhoea etc but i would really treat family with natural herbal medicines and tinctures  etc than to use allopathic medications. i do however need more basic medical supplies such as more suturing materials  iv lines   cannula s etc because i have been aware since 2020 that the way in which nursing and medicine were going to be practiced from that point on was sliding down a mountain side and about to crash! aahpa  the governing body and licensing vehicle for professional registrations to be approved and continued by individuals in that field here in australia put out a statement stating that they   the practising professionals   would in no way engage in conversation about the jabs  falsely accused of being a  vaccine   being anything less than  safe and effective  and to reiterate that these jabs are the only way to get the world out of this  pandemic . the medical staff would risk their professional degrees and registration if they went against the government rules on this technology.  it was our previous pm who actually was  the person to sign off in our highest court  that these technologies would be puahed on the australian people and now we have over 140  000 cases of severe disability   death and side effects from july 2021 to november 2022! this is more than jthe 50 years before 2021 and included all other vaccines given since 1971  but most australians are completely unaware of this. our medical staff were not able to discuss this experimental gene therapy with their patients! now we have had a new policy set to come on in early 2023 whereby a doctor will be unable to talk with a patient about different ways to manage a disease process including various treatment options. at our door is a health care system whereby a treatment protocol for that particular illness is set down already and that is the treatment that will be offered and bad luck if it doesn t work.  i am old enough to remember a doctor coming to my house 20 years ago to give me an injection for nausea and pain relief for a severe migraine i was having.  that old timer gp went to be with the lord a few years ago but he was the epitome of what a  good doctor  looked like back then and he always did his clinical practice and home visits in a 3 piece suit. i have pain all the time and i was talking to a pain specialist recently who really couldn t talk about it when i bought up the new health care policy changes with respect to what constitutes  care ! when i was practising nursing i looked at my patients to see how they were going  clinically and i will give you a brief example  one of 1000 s of the opposite of this! a dear friend had been operated on the afternoon before and she only had a 50 50 chance of surviving the operation. i told the younger male rn that i too was an rn and he was suitably unimpressed when i told him that i worked in a drug and alcohol detox ward within the hospital grounds. no questions about the years of clinical practice in other fields   id just failed the test in his eyes. so he said  so you re not a real nurse   at which point i knew he was arrogant and cocky and not good at his job. he  looked after  my friend that friday night and i went home and returned the next morning about 9 00 am. i could tell at that point that my friend wasn t going to make it and the nurse monitoring the monitor came infrequently and changed the settings on the baxter pump and put the o2 saturation device on her lips  then her ear and eventually i removed the 02 sensor because it was by then a failed exercise as she was actively dying. as i rubbed cream on her arms and lip balm on her lips my friend  who couldn t speak  just kept looking at me and her eyes were on mine as i shared with her my silly stories while watching her body shut down.  at this time it was morning tea time for the rn and the relief nurse came over to look at herwhen my friend s eyes rolled back in her head and i asked him if he was going to call a code but her lips and fingertips were blue by this time and her heart was stopping. i told this young male nurse that  i will stay out of your way but i won t leave and that you won t get her back because she s already gone ! i told my friend that i loved her and wouldn t forget her  which i haven t. the resus started almost immediately but i got the opportunity to speak to the senior consultant ic of the icu and i explained the clinical findings of the morning and the way the staff were monitoring the machine but not the patient! so he just told them to stop then and there and her suffering was finally over. as i was talking to the consultant  who would arrive for his afternoon shift but the male nurse from yesterday! he saw me talking to the dr and i remember giving him a stare that said i held him in contempt for not watching my friend!! i m going on about this for a reason which is that true nursing   where the patient is the centre of the care process  just isn t a part of nursing and the medical model is even worse.  i have seen pictures of patients almost killed within the hospital due to zero  care  being provided and many  patients dying alone due to neglect and using a known toxic drug which was ineffective to treat patients who had dnr on their charts without the knowledge or consent of the patient and his family! it is this kind of medicine and nursing that people with a sickness or in a trauma situation have to look forward to! please listen to the suggestions which pn has given and look after our  temple  better. i have had a couple of nasty falls within the last 2 years and i need a hip replacement badly but i m not going to enter a hospital unless i truly have no other option! we must become more resilient but it s going to turn into george orwell s 1984 shortly and that is scary. thanks for reading and god bless you pn and i always enjoy your content! lovely coloured jumper you had on today and i love the jewellery too! i hope to see you in the air shortly   lord willing! god bless your day.
we are who we are.my dad was born in 1894 and lived to be 82 years old.colon cancer took him finally.he was strong until the last 6 months or so of his life.
when the enemy gets inside the camps perimeter in war  we call it a broken arrow  and all hell breaks lose  this is what we are all going through in this medical industrial complex.
i m  of age  and starting to have medical issues . please don t tell me   this is what i have to look forward to  .
may hod protect you from their evil agenda
very good advice !
she s telling the truth. i had an extremely painful cornea surgery about 4 years ago. doctor was not very nice and was actually saying most surgeons don t even want to do cornea work because of all the hand holding they have to do.
i was supposed to get elective surgury.  i told the doctor i m not getting tested for you know what... and he just changed his demeanor in a negative way.  i never got the surgery and turns out i never needed it anyway.
watch dr john bergman videos on yt  to correct you joints... you will be glad you did
hang in there!   the lord is very very soon to pour out his glory   healing upon all true believers...then the great end-time revival followed by the rapture!   god bless  take good care of yourself.
@barbara mcintosh  a very happy new year to you and your family barbara.  may we keep our eyes on the skies awaiting his glorious return!
@repent  jesus is coming soon!  thank you so very much! i too am eagerly awaiting my saviours return and looking upwards for my redeemer. i will say that  even though i cannot know exactly when the lord will return  that it is certainly the season for his return! i wonder just how much worse things have to get globally before the actual tribulation begins .  none of my family believes in jesus christ and i will leave 5 adult children   whom i love very much as well as my 83 year old father  knowing the suffering which they must now endure!  it hurts me so but i know that they are adults and i have spent my entire life as their mother trying to be the parent that god s word says i must be in order to lead them to jesus   however they have rejected  him. i also will leave my almost 18 year old grandson   whom i helped raise until he was 10 and i love him as a son  but he lives in darkness too  not believing in the word and i can only just keep praying for them all and hoping that throughout the tribulation that they will see that i wasn t crazy and that they need jesus christ in their lives! god bless you and i hope to meet you in the clouds shortly!
@michelle sartori  thank you michelle for your heartfelt comment...i am looking up every day...awaiting his return!!  wishing you and yours a very healthy new  year!!!  and...i wish you lived across the street...you are one in a million my dear!!!
@michelle sartori  sister  there s a bible verse that says   i will contend with those who contend with you and i will save your children!    that s the lord promising he will do this!   i ll pray for your children and father s salvation right now  trust in him that he will indeed change their hearts!   if the lord gives us a promise  he is faithful to perform it!   he is not a man that he should lie  as the bible says!  blessings to you and happy new year!   may it be the year of the lord s return!
i just had my hip done outpatient for this very reason!
@barbara mcintosh  hello barbara and please accept my apologies for not replying sooner.  i was very busy yesterday and i am only catching up on my replies today. thank you for those lovely kind words. they really meant a lot to me.  all the very best until our saviour s return! god bless.
@repent  jesus is coming soon!  thank you very much for your positive words of faith and please accept my apology for not replying sooner.  i was busy yesterday and i am only catching up on my replies today.  you just reminded me of something which i had forgotten over the years  which is this. i was reading a book   which i m not sure of the location right now  about 2 years ago. it was about the wonderful man george muller who started building up several orphanages during the 1800 s due to the number of abandoned babies and children in england. this man was a prayer warrior of the highest order  but the most humble of men. he and his wife lost their only child when he was 18 months old and so they then basically became the parents of 1000 s of children over the years. george woke up in the morning and immediately went down on his knees which was a practice which he would keep for all his long years! he had started praying for his friends salvation and throughout the decades these people gave their lives to jesus.  only one person was left unsaved when he died in his 90 s and that person gave his life to jesus not long after this man died. thanks for the encouragement because i can only see just how against god they all are now  but god knows the future. i have prayed that whatever they must go through due to their disobedience in rejecting jesus   that before the final day that they would be saved. this includes my grandson and my father who blames god for the suffering which my mother endured because of the cancer that killed her many years ago. i will keep praying and holding onto god s promises  and thank you for reminding me of his promises! god bless your day! till he comes....
@pionus  how did you manage to get your hip replaced as an outpatient  i m not doubting you  i m just astonished as i have never heard of such a thing! i m afraid that mine might be more complex due to the damage i was born with.  as i was born with a dislocated hip and operated on as a baby   i have such a degree of wear and tear not only on the ball and socket joint but almost all the actual iliac crest is worn away   which is part of the reason that its so painful and difficult to walk! i m glad that you managed to get an operation done and i wish you all the best! my apologies for the delay in responding too. i was very busy yesterday and i am just catching up on replying now!
i ve watched it coming on for years.  at 74 i hate the thought of being under this system s control  so doing all i can to avoid them my life long goal.   thanks for the cold water of reality.
my parents are at that age. they are being given tons of meds and encouraged to take all the   preventives  possible
i was passing a kidney stone and went to the hospital in burlington vt to get some pain medication like i did years before when the same thig was happening while i lived in newport vt. in the newport hospital they gave me an injection of darvon and the pain was gone immediately and the entire time i passed the stone. what a relief. but in burlington vermont where i went for the second stone they ignored my pleas that i was in such pain and needed something for it while i was passing the stone. finally they did give me something like motrin after i passed the stone which did nothing for my pain which was gone anyways. i spent 3 hrs in the er in pain while the stone passed and they finally came to me and said i had passed it after viewing the xrays. everything they told me i could have told them. if i knew i was going to have to go thru all that pain i would have stayed home and gotten some pain medication from a friend and not had to deal with these pompous cold hearted assholes who made me suffer and charged me for it! now that i know they helped murder thousands of people who supposedly had covid with the cdc s death protocol i will never go to a hospital again.
thank you for your help for everything!  i went completely carnivore because my ability to keep healthy goes in hand and hand with being carnivore and keeping myself out of any hospital!  ever again!  amen!
you are wonderful patriot nurse !! keep speaking the truth!!!
my primary care physician will no longer see patients that are sick. if you have the flu  a head cold  or stomach issue  we re being told to stay home or go to the emergency department or urgent care center!!!
i worked alongside a person that was a md for 25 years. he left the medical system in the early 90 s because of what was happening in the hospitals.  i know enough about medical care and first aid to be dangerous.  i m luckier than most   i feel.  i will not walk into a hospital under my own power ever again.  i m starting to see some medical professionals starting to open up brick and mortar clinics as well as online clinics.  people you should also be aware of the medications that are coming out that are dangerous. do you your own research and thank god for people like this woman.  patriot nurse. thank you for what you do.  please keep this information coming.  you are one of god s gifts.
the pain and suffering that is being perpetrated by the present medical system is horrifying to say the least. as noted by the postings below. in 2018 i retired as an rn  with a 50 year career in multiple specialties. i wanted to work longer as a per diem nurse  but my latest and longest stint as a mental health nurse was becoming more and more dangerous. under staffing  violent patients  ridiculous protocols  nurses that weren t there to work or be safe with what they were doing  upper management that only cared about the numbers  shackled to the computer doing useless and excessive charting. most nights we had a great team but when they wanted to keep patients on our floor that needed emergency or intensive care or float us to medical and surgical floors  where our experience had waned  it became crystal clear that we were putting our licenses and the safety of those patients in jeopardy.  upon retiring i thought i would do something different where peoples lives were not on the line. sadly  i couldn t even get a job at the local grocery store. the disappointment didn t last because then 2020 rolled around and we all know what happened next. now honing my skills with growing and making herbal preparations.
one thing i consider while going through my day to day life is in most tyrannical blue states the only people still working in the police  ambulance  fire and hospital departments  etc. were and probably still are fanatical about themselves and others getting the jab or are probably bitter because they didn t have the strength to avoid it and stand up for what they believed.
just found out i am pregnant at 44.  i m terrified of going into the hospital to deliver.   i m a nurse  so i know!
soooo nice to see you back. very glad you are doing better and able to communicate with us again. miss you!! happy new year.
same for the dental care profession!! it s now  treatment plans  with thousands in charges  fancy 3d cameras  and a dentist that spends no more than 5 minutes in the room talking to you. unbelievable.
pn is right on. i m an rrt  39 years in the field.   best practices  is what most protocols are based on and they are very political.  this is how you get  we won t treat you with xyz because it s not approved and yes  there is a huge cohort of elderly patients who did not take care of themselves and pretty much live in the hospital now.  which means that the hospitals are jammed full.i work in a small  critical access hospital. the last shift i worked we were full no beds available. there are other hospitals in the area also full and not accepting patients.  our er was holding four patients  2 hip fxs  a copd chf and a copd stemi  with no room in sight.  and then you have the  woke  nonsense coming along with  proper pronouns .   i ve already said that my ventilator has a selection for  male or female    not  it .   i m 62  i hope i can last four more years.
a lot of folks getting sick these days. prayers to everyone.
@thepatriotnurse.  i am glad that i ended up on your channel.  i do believe that the lord sent me to your channel from the material that i have been receiving. i do think that people will be denied care unless they have some magic  vaccine  or injection when the next plandemic comes. now i just need to get to one of your classes so i can be prepared.  may god bless you and your work.
i always said the very most i got out of my degree was to take care of my family
@rebelsbestfriend 2021  my friend gets them from spinach smoothies from other high in oxalate foods  she san rn. its presumptious to demand someone fix their diet without knowledge to conclude they have a bad diet to begin with.
thank you for telling us the truth.
my mother  who is 70 and healthy  active  very thin  was told by her dr   her english came back with slight abnormalities. he ordered bloodwork  stress test. her heart function came back great  but she was told her cholesterol was high at 221 was prescribed statins. i told her to do some research and told her i wouldn t take those if i were you   doesn t sound real high to me  she didn t want to listen to me. then my aunt told her the same as me  then she started questioning the dr. he then told her  his recommendation  is not to take them after he literally prescribed them. sounds like  they just want some sort of kickbacks. i never take any men s prescribed without researching whether i really need it or not. i don t trust most drs. i just had a growth removed from my uterus and was biopsied...thankfully it came back benign. but i would research everything they were telling me. if bloodwork came back slightly abnormal levels  i would research that. my experience drs tell you hardly any info  even if you ask them  and they don t like answering questions
i m 62 and i have health problems. half came from the drugs the ba treated me with. i am not lazy  nor am i a sloth  as you say. i ve already decided i will die at home because the last place i will go is to a doctor or a hospital.  2nd  i used to be in nursing and left because of the abuses i witnessed among g my peers. the abuse is not new. it s getting worse. but not new. thank you.
i am glad to see that you are healthy.... love and peace . thanks for your hard work.
i agree mary  when i worked in the industry  lots of lazy  slothful ones earning a paycheck back then  too. always the choice of how we want to behave.
i ve been in nursing since 1993. i plan to never be a patient in the hospital. we are constantly out of supplies  medicines and have inexperienced nurses. the young nurses have very little compassion and 90  are mean. i had some tell me that when they worked in nyc during covid  they never went into a patient s room to take care of them. no food  no water  no care. some of my colleagues went to nyc and left within the first 3 hours. the young docs are nicer  but are very obedient to the system. they refuse to believe anything that isn t given to them down the chain of command. even when faced with the truth  they refuse to see it. i was treated like a leper when i refused the c jabby. please learn to take care of yourself. they don t care. it s all about the
thank you. very insightful. i m in the uk. we have the same problems. low staffing  poor care and tests for the unmentionable to get access. i have lost 67 pounds in weight in 2022 with keto carnivore  just so i can stay healthy. hospitals scare me now.
this has been going on for a long time. my mother died in 1999 in canada simply from lack of monitoring and neglect by the health system. she was 74 and had hsd three heart attacks due to long term diabetes.
i m retired military  as is my brother... my brother was having surgery this last year and the hospital lobby was demanding i wear a mask! i told them i m medically exempt!  everyone with emphysema  bronchitis  ocps  copd   breathing problems  neurological problems  ect are exempt for wearing masks...period!  they got that  deer in the headlights look !! i told them   in accordance with the americans with disabilities act  ada  of 1990  you are not a doctor  nor are you my doctor! i don t have to discuss or explain my disabilities with you! it s a  75 000 fine to discriminate against me because of my disabilities and it s a  150 000 fine for every offense after that! i can go out those doors and come back in every 5 minutes!  ..  uh...go ahead sir !!
thanks for sharing your knowledge.  a majority of people in this country are oblivious to what s actually going on.  hopefully good folks like you will help people become more aware.  prayers for your health.
thank you. you are and have been for several years a remarkable human being.
i m not a nurse but i can tell you this women knows what she s talking about !
my loved one with advanced dementia was transported from her care facility and waited 6 hours in the non-emergency er to be admitted to the hospital for labs  x-rays and treatment without the knowledge or consent of her healthcare poa. by the time i found out visiting hours were over and i was not allowed to see her.
my son was sick with a respiratory problem. i had a colts 45 baseball cap on. everyone got seen even people who came in later and we were finally seen with a almost empty waiting room. i could not figure out why until i started thinking they saw my hat as a nod to the 45th president.  it s crazy they are that petty
god bless you pn for all you do.  i am a 60  yr. old uninsured person and i have very little money.  i m constantly trying to get the best bang for the buck in whatever i do   by necessity .  what can a poor person like me do to try and protect my family and myself from the corrupt health system   also  do you know about rife healing frequencies   royal raymond rife technology    i listen to these frequencies on youtube whenever i can because it doesn t cost anything   i listen at the public library .  a company called spooky 2 sells equipment that focuses this type of treatment.  i can t afford it  but i was wondering if you or any of your associates has used it and what results they had.  hope your strength returns asap.  thank you.
my son recently inhaled a straight pin into his lung  he has  autism . my husbandvis a nurse. we brought him in immediately.  it took 30 hours to get him in surgery. i sat by him and watched him like he was in bad hands. i have stage 3 cancer and god supernaturally kept me awake and i didn t eat think i even missed meds. the first hour they were already pushing the flu vaxx. i know what s up we quit everything v when he was injured at 18 months like thousands of other s that have the same story. god is with us if you allow him. psalm 91.
good work for alerting  people to the  usuary within the the healthcare  sector
great updates! thanks for all you do! god bless!
i just recently had a major spine surgery a few weeks ago and you are right.
you are a blessing in these trying times.  thank you for your great information.
you re exactly right. i saw it for myself when i was in the hospital.
this info is sooooo true!  i kept changing jobs as a nurse due to the serious lack of empathy from most management and the brazeness of these young unskilled punks that have flooded every area of nursing i ve been it...and sad news..it s tolerated..they d rather lose a good competent caring nurse to keep those  caregivers ...     i guess
same happened to mine  she was 66. disgusting
@miki miki    my condolences for your loss. i live in a country where the health system is very available. i was permanently paralyzed by a stroke in 2010. at any time i can go to a hospital or clinic without an appointment and see a doctor in five minutes or half the time no waiting at all. that s not just me but everyone. the medical technology i believe is more advanced here than in canada and has kept me alive for over 12 years. friends told me by phine way back in 2010 and 2011 if i ever went back there i d be dead in two years. i have been ba k to visit four times since 2010 and i think they were right. when you have a stroke every minute counts as every minute you a losing body function. i was delayed an hour because i wa on the floor paralyzed on my left side home alone. all i coukd do was drag myself over to pull on the cord of my phone thst was recharging on a table. i couldn t stand up to reach it. all i coukd remember was the number of my department at the university where i worked for help. they didn t know where i lived. that was the delay until they found someone who knew.in canada the wait could be hours or days ss has happened and the person expired. i don t think that happened to m mother. she apparently died in her sleep. but i flew back from europe to british colymis just weeks before she died and found she was getting little or no help and surprised thst though she wa on the medical plan she hs o pay for ambulance and all medications they used on her in transit. not covered by medical plan. here i paid  25 for everything because medical plan covers everything including dental care 70  or in cases of poor people 90 . my brother died in canada five years ago and i am beginning to wonder abou that too.
what i am seeing now as an actively working paramedic is the unwillingness of pcps and their nps   pas to treat patients and it is starting to filter down to the urgent care and clinics. they expect ems and various emergency departments to treat these people for them. so i m seeing a continuous  mass dumping  of patients on my ems service and our area ed. patients are constantly calling 911 for concerning but not emergent complaints because their doctor told them to call. to your protocol point the idea that an ed has to medically clear a healthy psych patient is ludicrous. let a psych facility  who has licensed  physicians do that. bottom line is we do not treat patients based on their healthcare needs anymore but rather on liability necessity.
i had a major surgery that required my stomach cut wide open due to an ovarian cyst as big as a 7 month fetus. the refused to give me pain medication they said that an epidural will be all i need but they where wrong. it seems like they fix you think your are a cave person who can do this without pain  medication then sent me home in a few days being cut wide open. i felt like the dr and her team didn t care about how severe my pain was and sent me on few days after surgery. this gave me ptsd
you re doing great work! keep it up!
i don t think it s as bad as all that. if you look at the numbers of americans that refused the jab  it brings hope that everyone isn t brain dead.
yep  welcome to the decline.....
psalms 37 1-40 amen
@kathleen pimentel  thank you. i needed that. god bless you.
as old  retired nurses  my wife and i have observed that nursing is no longer a profession. it is simply a well paying job to the young generation. one sign of the demise is the lack of participation in professional organizations like aorn or the ana.
you clarify how far things went in medical field. thanks
prayers for a full recovery and a great year
love you patriot nurse!  god bless you and keep you!  my story is too long to tell but i can vouch firsthand on what you are saying.  this has been going on for a very long time!  prayers for your full recovery!  we need you!
i don t even have a family doc anymore and can t find any in private practice within 25 miles. they ve all been hoovered into corporate systems. the one i had for 40 years retired because he wouldn t go along with the corporate party line about jabs and general practice.  village medical. horrible outfit.   got through c19 last february. wasn t bad  but gave me pericarditis for the 3rd time in my life. had to see my cardiologist and got in quite a discussion about not being jabbed. he drank the who and cdc koolaid and bragged that he s been jabbed 4 times. i fired him. got strep in july that turned into scarlet fever and honestly didn t care if i died. no way was i going to a damn doctor. never saw one and recovered with great nursing care from my husband. if anything really bad happens  i m pretty much reconciled to death because i m not getting on that medical merry go round again. i either die as comfortably as possible in my own home or let the system kill me. i choose home.
my husband has been waiting for a pacemaker to be put in for 4 months and just keeps getting the run around about setting up a time to have it done!
here s one for you in oct 2021 i went to the er a little background in june i had a heart attack before that i had blood work done in march my cholesterol and my triglycerides were really high and my bp was high as well so i had telemed appointment with my dr he said over the phone that everything was elevated and said not to worry  fast forward to my heart attack i had a 99  blockage in my right coronary artery had a stent put in 5 days in the hospital so 5 days after i got out i had the followup for my original appointment in march so i went in and i was a little hot going in. the doctor came in after his assistant took my vitals and said this what we are going to do  not knowing that i had a heart attack just days before he explained that we are going to put me on this and that then i interrupted him and said i had a heart attack 6 days ago and he was taken aback  then he said i guess i am a little late i said yeah just a little then i said to him you know what he said what you re fired i got up walked out the door then in august i woke up with vertigo and i was deaf in my left ear out of nowhere i went in again they gave me some nausea meds but still deaf so i go back into the er in oct with pain around my ears and they ached all around with intense pressure they checked me in after a 4 hour wait i got in nurse called my name we went in  right off the bat she put an iv in and drew some blood while we were interacting she was really rude and i called her out and said hey you are mean she said well you can leave anytime you want i said wow really  she then left 30 mins later she came back and said we are going to test you for covid i said i am not here for that she did the test anyway and i said wow that hurt then she said if you don t like my work you can leave anytime  she leaves then another guy comes in and xrays my my lungs he was good i told him about the nurse and he said i will make sure she does not came back in here so then this other guy comes and we are talking and he says are you homeless i was shocked  that he would say that and says my covid test came up negative i said i already had covid in dec of 2020 i know what the symptoms are like he sais a few other things that were rather abrupt and said we are going to recommend a neurologist hey really wanted me gone i could feel it. so i called my wife and told her what was going on and she said she was on her way i ripped out the iv put some gauze on my arm got dressed and walked out of the room i was in the head person saw me start to walk out and said i can t leave i said really try and stop me here s my point  they wanted covid patients the place was packed with the elderly the make money for a covid test and money for a positive test then they make money for hospitalization for covid they also make money if they put you on a ventilator for covid and if you die with covid they make more money to make a long story short the best advocate you can have is yourself  i do not trust anybody anymore it will get worse before it gets better good luck all.
thank you patriot nurse for the heads up. seriously  the sick or patient is not getting adequate care unless you re on medicaid. from what i have seen  they are getting better not equal medical carw and this is the truth. i have to say the government and the insurance company s are in the doctor s office with the patient. this has to change. how can  we the people  change the medical field     physician  heal thyself   luke 4 23.
timely advice for troubled patriots.  thank you sister. shalom
i never dreamed in 2016 that a second diagnosis of breast cancer would be the vehicle to move me into retirement from the state university hospital and actually save my life from having been there through this debacle. god took what the enemy meant for evil and gave me so many blessings in return. i bless you with continued recovery and strength in the full armour of god. keep wielding that sword of the spirit!
i m sorry to hear about your family member. i can tell you as someone who has been in and out of hospitals all my life  this started long before the last couple years. this started at least 5 years before covid. i will never go to a hospital again.
excellent information as always. feel better soon!
you are a beacon of light because you proclaim  the truth. also a fine example of christian caring.  a lot claim it but few live it. thanks
i m glad to see you re back and i hope you re feeling much better
as always  thank you for your wisdom. take care and get well soon. happy new year!
i had an l3-l4 fusion three years ago just as c19 was erupting in the east. it was an eye opener. besides a nurse saving me from a  hospitalist   i was stunned when they wouldn t send me home with just a few oxycontin tablets. i mean  i asked for two or three. seriously  the pain killing effectiveness of those were amazing after they stopped the morphine  or whatever it was  drip. they hand the stuff out like candy for aches and pains and addictions but refuse it for post surgical recovery. i could go on but don t want to bore anybody. pn covers it well.
i moved to sc and was looking for a doctor for my children and many of them i called said they have to have all vaccines up to date in order for them to see them.  if they weren t they had to jab them the first visit and then they would see us.  said no thank you and hung up.  was appalled
god bless you patriot nurse. continuing to send prayers your way
i had to goto a hospital for services  refused a bed  got treated in er   sent home. because i didn t take  the jab.  i told my  ex  dr. i  m not against taking vaccines  just not taking experimental ones. the hospital had plenty of beds  they were only filling them for people who had  the jab.
i wanted to add a separate comment regarding a question i have. i have hlhs  i m on medicaid for my disability and have ssi for the same reason. my question is  while i have been working on stocking up my heart medication  are there any alternatives to basic drugs such as baby aspirin  digoxin  and lisinopril  i also take budesonide for my ple. suggestions  thank you!
you re right. i m fuggin  freaked cuz i need major knee surgery...went to one of the only two ortho clinics here. i checked in  looked around   felt pissed af.....the place was like a factory. the entire visit with this doc was extremely shallow  almost like i knew more than him.. i m so in tuned with my body. after i left  i got in my car  screamed and said  i will not let this f  ker touch me . there only one other clinic in town and my experience with the whole  system  is a war  a total war.great video.
@heather smith  so right. after the nurse who saved me from the freakish doctor who wanted to put me on insulin  not diabetic finished her shift  the care dropped off a cliff. i remember my fourth meal  discharged on day two  being dropped off and just plopped on the table thing over my thorax. i couldn t sit up nor wriggle up to eat anything that wasn t a finger food. the drip had been withdrawn and the wound was really starting to hurt. i was so glad to get out of there. the other weird thing was being awakened every two hours by the nurses for the rounds they have to make. i mean i was plugged in to all the machines and catheterized...why wake me. idk.
i had the opposite experience. my 18 yo son had ortho shoulder surgery. they gave him 30 oxys. he took just one and it knocked him out so bad he swore no more. but damn  so many kids get hooked on these  why send a young man home with 30!!
@monica kling  i was very fortunate that tylenol was fairly effective for me. more so than the prescription stuff they gave which caused severe constipation. i just do not understand why they would restrict the stuff to the point where it cannot be used for its intended purpose. if that is to be policy then just ban it.
what you are saying about the way healthcare quality has dropped is so true in all aspects of our lives. we need to depend on the lord jesus christ yah for everything. really love watching you. i ve been hurt in a major way from doctors so i know how they were already. there are some very bad people with only a few that cared anyway though.
as a retired rn  this is all so sad
appreciate all you do -    true!!
my 8 yr old granddaughter had strep     and her lymph node swelled up so bad  she couldn t move her head . her parents took her to the er and they didn t have strep tests available! then this past week  all 3 of them has a stomach virus and they were sent home from the dr  with  to early to diagnose anything   and no medication! it s ridiculous-why even pay for insurance !
i knew  from the beginning of its creation  the just in time supply method would cause people issues from time to time  in more dire times when there are emergencies and or shortages .
3 thank you for insight and help through all of it. keep trusting your gut and def keep following the lord.
i m finding going to work as a nurse more difficult each day. i do insurance reviews for patients admitted to the hospital. systems  protocols and people are breaking down. it breaks my heart to see a field i have loved for 20  years change and not for the better. our patients are poorer for it as our compassion and empathy play such an enormous part in healing.
wow! this is troubling. thank you again patriot nurse for yet another great video!shalom.
my wife and i never took a certain jab and my wife went to urgent care here in virginia this month with flu like symptoms that would not go away. she asked the doctor for a prescription for hcq and the doctor said no! pure evil
my 20 years working in hospitals and clinics says every word here is gospel. the system is if anything much worse than it sounds. i would tell you the truth  but yt can t handle the truth.another thing i know from experience  the vast majority of health care situations boil down to basic first aid. so take the course  it will pay for itself many times over.
take an accurate list of current medications or supplements taken  with name  dose  and regimen  or take the medications themselves. this is important to get necessary medications restarted.the electronic medical record keeps a list of your medications  past and current. often times the prescribers order old medications that are not needed and even dangerous.
i was in the hospital for a heart attack  i have severe asthma . my o2 sats would bounce around between 84-90  no oxygen was ordered  no doctor ever came in to do any type of evaluation or even ask me any question about my medical history. i was there for just 2 days and in those 2 days i was brought a tray 1 time. i kept asking if i was npo for some reason   oh i ll find out  never to return . i videoed my entire stay and interactions with all staff and just a few hours before my release i stepped up to the nurses station and asked what the policy was on meals for the patients  where we supposed to buy our own  where we supposed to fill out a menu  i told them i d been n that room for 43  hours and was given a tray 1 time . the looks on their faces  i thought they were going to hyperventilate lol ..they became frantic when i told them that they had my medical history  who my doctors where and that they had left me untreated for my lupus  my severe asthma and high blood pressure the entire time  after having a heart attack no meds were ever given to me  i may as well have been in a dank 3rd world country. i was a psychiatric nurse for 30 years and love the nursing profession  it has gone to hell in a hand basket .i had called my sister and had her bring me what i needed but they didn t know that  they were so disorganized  so uncaring about their patients well being that i seriously thought of during  but decided not to  seems that money was not their problem  lack of work ethic and a generation of staff that had zero ability to relate to human needs and to know what true nursing was about.
my sweet mama was killed in the hospital 2018. a palliative care doc  a do sent by god  told us they were doing more harm than good. she was furious looking at her chart and confirmed everything i d been thinking. unfortunately  she rec d we take her home with hospice  in order to reduce her medication and hopefully save her . it was too late  mostly because mom was tired of spending money on natural docs and you don t help from reg docs when you re on hospice. they pushed and pushed their morphine. she was not in pain! finally i showed up one day and they had started crisis care. step-dad didn t question anything. i showed up too late.
thank you for saying truth   this helps me in confirmation of what i see going on.
watched you years and years ago when you said this same thing and i listened.i took everything you said to heart.we changed our entire lifestyle and at 61 i take no medications and i am healthy as far as i know. i had  professionals  advising  both sides to the vaccine debate.you know how they are always loud and vocal on what is right or wrong.one thing i watch...i am not really going to listen to anyone who gives medical advise who isn t reasonably  healthy in their own right.if you are obese hobbling around with gout dependant on insulin have heart issues and out of control cholesterol don t tell me that the woohoo vaccine is going to kill me because you have both feet on a banana peel yourself.i don t need advice to take it either.i will listen and i can decide for myself.
so right on  very good information. i absolutely know this is true. thank you.
you need to count on god who is ya and pray in jesus name.  you do not pray to yeshua jesus christ.  you ask in his name
amen
@mary marseglia  no one said you do... i didn t say to pray that way. you did. i didn t say anything about how to pray at all... thank you though
is there a way for all the good and great doctors and nurses who left  to ban together and make new schools where people like me who wanted to be in the field but didn t and will absolutely not enter it now  because of what you said .have a chance  it would have to definitely be run and programmed away from regulatory and licensing protocols we have now. i let my cna go in 2020. i wanted to be a nurse. but because of covid didn t go into nursing school.
we don t have enough nurses.  i know it cause i m a nurse.  omg...what pn says is true.
we have just experienced the terrible decline when our family member was admitted to the hospital this month. expect to stay with your family member  private duty  to intervene for their well being and care!
i work in a hospital. hospitals lost so many good nurses during covid. now most hospitals are running on new graduates who have little experience and not much compassion. many are travel nurses who can just transfer back out and to another hospital if you don t like how they do. todays new nurses enter the medical field already disassociated from empathy or sympathy. they ve been emotionally suppressed.  now top that with new nurse scenario with no supplies and you have chaos. new nurses don t know how to improvise. a seasoned nurse does.  hospitals are no longer healing places. they are governed now by the govt. if they weren t  their govt. funding and new money to build bigger would stop. the govt would punish and target them. look around as your drive. are your hospitals building bigger right now  are they putting up new hospitals every where for certain health care corporations  we have people waiting in our er waiting room as long as 24 hrs.also  some meds are out. nurses and dr. s are having to use alternative meds that may not be their 1st 2nd or 3rd choice. and stop going to the er for small stuff. you put yourself at risk of getting more sick when you do that. go to the er when you believe you might die is you don t or you are bleeding profusely. and stop eating leftovers up until they make you vomit and get the  h!  !! don t come in with a sore throat and other trivial things you could treat at home. you are exposing yourselves to germs for many hours that could make you really sick
all of these stories are reminding me of how prisoners in the nazi concentration camps would desperately resort to the infirmary only to be killed there
i ve seen this too. one of my patients was head of hospice for part of county i used to live in  she and i knew each other for quite some time and it was very clear to me that hospice is pusher of strong opiates and they are there to nudge things along. don t you know medicare and ssi has just been too used by the elderly and elderly starts in the mid 60s from what i saw and heard.
@silvershades  it s sickening.
i dealt with that with my ma last december. she had a bowel obstruction and needed surgery. they waited 6 days and wanted go another 3 days till i bitched and said her strength wouldn t be good for surgery then and they were just making her suffer.that conversation started at 9 30 a.m and  she was in surgery that day at 2 pm.
glad you are doing better. prayers
a brave woman who loves humanity.
i have been in the hospital many times since 1998.  i had to go in this past august.  i drove myself to  the best hospital  in the hospital district  memorial hermann.  i loved going there there before.  what a change!  i was left in the dress i wore when i got there the whole 3 days i was in.  the only pain medicine i got was alternating between ibuprofen tablets and acetomenophine tablets!  i had an iv given to me at the er  but it wasn t used the whole 3 days i was there.  i was also given a heating pad for the pain.i asked for toilet paper  but they forgot to bring it.  when i ended up in the restroom  there was no more toilet paper.  i pulled the cord for the nurse.  i don t think she understood me.  i finally found a washcloth that i wiped with.  i couldn t wait to get out of there!
you are 100  correct beware when you go to the doc
thank you pn for raising our awareness in healthcare industry changes. i believe that prayers are being answered as you look like you re getting some rest and you sound much better today. it s always good to see and to listen to you and your detailed presentations. rest as much as you are able to do so. always watching for you...michigan.
thank you so much patriot nurse. may god bless and protect you and yours.
great information. thank you for sharing. years ago you talked about dr. christopher s herbs and book. we did our research  and  it  really  helped  my family through covid.. thanks again for helping us  and so many others...!
yes  the  good days  are gone. i m in a hospital now  been here a week. and it s very clear that i m just a financial number. no one cares. no one gives as! there are a few nurses that still do and are not just about the  . unfortunately for them  they are losing this cash cow. i was dx with lyphoma cancer on thursday  and chf on tuesday. so now i know this will likely be my last new year s day. but if they truly  cared   it wouldn t be. also if the fda wasn t so political  i might have had a chance too. good luck pn!  keep fighting the good fight!
loved your videobut i ve got a huge question why aren t doctors starting cash only offices that can bypass most of the corrupt medical system
i was taking oxycontin and oxycodone for 15 years started from a bad accident and a severe condition.  my doctor stopped writing my prescriptions because he moved to a facility he said prevented him from writing them. went to his recommended pain management doctor and he refused to give them to me after a 10 minute exam.  he didn t even see or hear all my problems.   went thru serious withdraw symptoms  sick as hell for two weeks.  still having trouble and now in pain 24 7.  they don t care about us anymore
pn. i am an rn who retired at the beginning of covid. i agree with everything you say and am seeing it in the care myself and my family have tried to receive since march 2020.  the part i slightly disagree on is that this is due to covid. health care back in 2008 took a big dive  and it all started back in the  earlier in the 80 s. taking care of my mom and mother in law in their final years and in hospice was an absolute nightmare  to the extent of what i would consider neglect and malpractice and causing early death.  the medical system is pure evil.
i think you brought up a very important point  the laziness and slothfulness of the culture.  the consequences of these behaviors comes in many forms  from the corruption of hospitals to the failing of one s health.  it is reaping what you sow  survival of the fittest.  i know many people who vehemently refuse to listen.
thought i hadn t seen you in a while.  glad you ve recovered.  i noticed this deterioration too.  hard to believe in this  leading  country.
you have no idea how right patriot nurse is. i taught 12 years at a tier 1 university  both nurses and medical students. upper administration are passing students that failed my course changing their grade sometimes but  30 point. we have a massive amount of physicians and nurses who will kill people due to their incompetence. never let a family member go into a hospital unless you have someone with them at all times. do not be afraid to challenge the healthcare workers  most of the newer ones have absolutely no idea what they re doing! i am a phd prepared nurse in medical education with 20 years as an er icu background  so i have the credentials to back up what i am saying.
wonderful   informative video! thank you for your  advice.
love you and your work. i was wondering what you think and know about doctor simone goldi heard somewhere that she and some other patriot doctors. we re going to start setting up healthcare facilities all across the country. with hand picked doctors and nurses. that take their oath of medicine and healthcare seriously.
lord have mercy!!!!!
i m a homeopath and my wife is an herbalist. there isn t much we can t handle. surgeries are our limitations. but i m even studying up on a few of those.
i amn ermd and i ve seen great difficulty getting beds upstairs since covid not because of covid.  because of the disruption. it seems like a lot of nurses went traveling some come to us and some go away. you would think it would even out but it doesn t. other nurses i think did not finish school and dropped out other nurses retired early. because they were scared of covid. this led to a huge nursing work force shortage. which means entire floors of all hospitals are empty because there s no nurses so the er basically babysits these patients until they re actually better and ready to be discharged. that means there s no rooms in the er to see patients. we see patients primarily in the waiting room and discharge them from there. that s not appropriate and it s going on every hospital.
i just found you - this. what a smart caring lady. you can tell this was from her heart.
there s a point in this video when you talk about your observations of the people involved in the industry as being harsh criticisms but i can honestly say from my experience as a patient in these last couple of years it matches exactly what i felt.
agree with ed  glad you re back. keep doing what you are doing. from west michigan.
smart! you ll be the few left standing when shtf.
@hycoperosity  i had ibs in my 20 s. the healthier i ate the better it got. when i eliminated dairy for a few years it went away. years later i ended up with skin issues and eliminated grains. it doesn t totally get to the root cause of why you can t tolerate these foods but it at least gets rid of the symptoms. i hope that helps a little  i tried to keep it short .
that s the only thing that troubles me. needing surgery or having an accident where they have to reattach something! otherwise i want nothing to do with the way medicine is practiced today.
where do you live  bet you and your wife could find many many patients through a channel such as this  and a great barter network could be formed!
@julia brown  yes! i need a good homeopath near houston!
@dctoontime  that s what concerns me too. when my son gashed his leg against a broken pot outside i realized i really need to learn to stitch! if my out of town son ended up in the hospital for something i would be horrified.
@laura nilsen  sad that we live in these times. we may have to set up a parallel society within this corrupt one. i have no trust in the medical machine  government  elections  organized religion  banking system. it may be that likeminded people will have to live together in communities where we can sidestep the evil that has overtaken just about everything.and yes  learning to stitch up wounds is a valuable skill in these days. i avoid hospitals like the plague!
type i diabetes.  if you can help me figure that out  i will be thankful.
@hycoperosity  go check out dr berg on you tube  the guy has 9 million subs  i went on a carnivore diet and it helped me a lot
@pete  i have type i.  i can not eat for days and still go into dka.  no food  only water.  i know i tried it.  then longer term i tried eating less than 600 calories a day and 0-20 carbs.  guess what....dka.
i love this!
the part where you said the days are gone when you call to speak to the doctor and they wont listen to you is everywhere i ve noticed in the past 5 years or so.
same as the preceding year  only worse every year. as a fellow nurse  i attest she is right.
thank you so much for your honesty as you shed light on this issue. i have been in healthcare for 32 years and i can hardly believe what i am seeing. their  protocol  killed my best friend   would have killed my mother   sister had they not refused the government s hospital  protocol . may yeshua continue to give you his strength   wisdom.
two decades ago i worked in manufacturing. we made custom products. we were constantly waiting for parts because of the just in time supply stream.
i am in arizona. i wish i knew where to find a good  granny  to go to if i need it. i wish i could find a shaman as well  finnish people love shamans  too . i use herbs for most things and am not taking prescriptions. i do need to reduce my  figure   because round is not a good shape for me. this is excellent information and thank you for being so direct patriot nurse!
i want to cry with you. my mother s been suffering since her decision to get multiple jabs. i pray for her and her specialist  s  now.
i have the va to fall back on. as in finding out one of my heart valves had calcified and i was diabetic  though i don t have to take those shots. va in frisco operated on me  giving me a new  artificial heart valve and it didn t cost me a dime. and this included being flown on a twin engine plane from reno to the frisco airport. this was 7 years ago  a month after i retired at 62.
i have been dealing with what i call doctors that have gone through the machine for approximately 10 years now. i am in a county health system and i had to fire all of these doctors from my movement disorder doctor because of my parkinson s to my neurosurgeon because of my spine diseases also my oncologist i had breast cancer and was never given any treatment. even when the surgery had to be stopped  because my surgeon cut her fingers and they sewed me right up. the only thing they did for me was give me aftercare pills  and those almost killed me alone now the county health system for the past two years is field full of illegals in texas  then other minorities and then me at the bottom of the barrel and several employees did tell me this. so i stay away  and i pretty much treat myself.
yes she s a hundred percent correct had just experienced recently with my mother she had passed away before thanksgiving  from the sorriest pathetic health care she received. yes you have to be your own doctor in these wicked evil times we are living in. but it s only for a short time.
glad you are on the mend.  sending blessings your way
just awesome  what a great gift you have to be able to share this the way you do .  thank you
my 74 yr old sister slipped on slippery sheet to the floor  not far but broke her shoulder area. went to local hospital in florence  az couldn t help her  small hospital  to full. they then went  to masa az still no help surgeon said zi don t take your insurance. so  3 days later at home on pain meds with broken shoulder and probably swelling bad. still waiting hospitals said they were to full. she will have to go to phoenix  az maybe. this is crazy.
thank you. good advice good lifestyle and diet plus exercise. we need not be so dependant on hospitals and frequent clinic visits. the hospitals and clinics are so full with patients. so much illness and virus related problems. thanks for sharing
in july  of 2022  i ran out of ms meds  called my doc and she said i needed to make an appointment to get my prescription re filled.....the earliest they could book me is jan23  2023. i was able to go to a charity and get 2 months worth of medicine and i have been making it las for the scheduled 6 mths until my doc appointment.
i am so glad you are bringing the subject to the forefront.  the hard part is now as a nurse being on the receiving end. keep up the good work pn.
thank you pn   you give me hope
your looking and sounding good. glad to see your over whatever it was that was making you feel yucky.i am so blessed that i have a pcp that s very caring. she s been in family medicine for over a decade. she s been my pcp for about  5 yrs now and i love her to death. problem is  i m trying to wake her up as to what s going on. trying to get her to start prepping and so on and she just won t do it. wether she doesn t believe all this is actually happening or she just flat out thinks i m a loon and reading to many conspiracy theories i don t know. but i just can t seem to get her to come around. but  she is one of those rare ones that truly does care about people and wants what s best for her patients. for years  she would constantly get on me for smoking. i kept telling her that i was afraid of gaining weight  i was over 300 pounds at this point  and i would quit when i was ready. well  one day i decided i was ready. i mean  i  felt it  deep down. it was time. my next appointment with her  i told her i was ready to quit smoking and i thought she was gonna stroke out she got so happy and excited...haha..she wrote me a script for nicotrol and now i ve been cigarette free for 14 months..
this year my daughter was injured   needed hardware in her collar bone  she wound up with mercer in the bone  she went to hospital with 104 fever   they blew her off! i told her to go to another hospital  they admitted her   she was there 10 days  they put her on a regime of vancomyicin 3 times a day  put a pic line in   sent her home  after about 2 weeks she was very sick  went back to hospital   shew admitted   her husband faced timed me  she was swelling   getting this horrible rash  i told him to get the nurse  she was like she doesn t look swollen to me  we get the nursing supervisor   she agreed with nurse. she wasn t talking   swelling. the next day she was incoherent 105  they put her on ice  i spoke to the nurses   they were like she s ok  so i called nursing director  she immediately went to room   called critical care  all the dr s involved   got things moving  turns out she had dress syndrome from the vancomyicin   she almost died 2x that week   spent 21 days in hospital   if not for that nursing director i believe she would ve died  out of all the people taking care of her she was the only decent human being!
i m listening 3rd time through. . . might it be extremely helpful if medical professionals leaving the field went into education  especially at the hs level   tech schools. our kids need veterans training  teaching   modeling skills for them.
i was just in the hospital for 5 days the nursing staff was good but they were short handed i m a retired cna  and i loved my job
i trust no rn who seen.
@gameliel auceps  seen what
hospitals are frightening places  it s rare to get anyone who is empathetic and when night shift comes in  pray hard that you can survive to the next morning!
hospital i work at is hurting so bad that they re offering free tuition for 50 workers or family of workers to get their rn degree but they have to make a two year commitment. i m in the lab and i see the mass exodus in all areas. my issue is i m so specialized i would go back to minimum wage if i went to change jobs.
bless you sister. good to see you mended up.
i am 77 and never go to a medical doctor but maybe an alternative care if needed. crisis care is all medical doctors are worth seeing but definitely not for health care. i didn t get to this age and functionally healthy by seeing someone who is the  4 cause of death and higher for those of my age
great take! years ago a pal who taught nursing told me he observed that in the past many came from farming backgrounds vs this shifted to city people who were way less comfortable around body fluids.my add to this is that common sense has been weakened re trying to understand a patient s issues. now nurses are simply blindly following protocol  just doing my job  and doing what greedy self-serving entities have put in place. same with doctors.
there is no shortage of automatons  it s wild. engaging with them is very disturbing by what their programs are saying and doing. father forgive them for they know not what they do
there are some things under our control. social support isn t one of them. loneliness is at an epidemic level in the us.
some people have to take medications for certain diseases like pd. don t make people feel horrible if they must take something.sometimes it s a matter of life or death and may just be genetic and can t be helped.
if you are serious about taking control of your your family s healthcare needs  then i highly recommend taking pn s medical prep classes. the 4 days i recently spent training with her in keller  tx prepared me with the knowledge supplies to confidently treat myself my family s medical needs moving forward  much better than the medical kit i ve been building up for years. plus a side benefit...my torah knowledge was greatly increased also! all glory to yeshua!
i don t know what i m going to do they have been giving me suboxone for chronic pain for years now and it does nothing for pain but makes you want to die if you don t take it ! i ve had half my small intestine removed and can t seem to get a referral to a gastroenterologist   i know i have to stop taking this crap and try and get some help for my insides but it feels like a hopeless situation  .. i also know that things are going to get very very bad everywhere sooner than later so i can t afford to be sick with withdrawals wile we will all be going back to the ways of old      i don t trust the medical system and i m almost afraid to go to the hospital !  i m almost 56 and i ve wrecked a few bikes and messed my body up pretty bad ! but now doctors call me a drug addict after getting me hooked on every pain med under the sun! but they give me suboxone for pain. i never would have taken it if i knew it was so horrible to come off or that it does very little for pain ! but they never ever tell you these things !   the medical system has all but killed me !   they have saved my life only to give me a life of living hell!
extremely well articulated. at first the truth hurts...
i read where one person testified that they were given the clot shot in the middle of the night  while asleep -- against their will!   they had said before that they did not want it!  this is really scary!
covid did push me out to retire early at 62 rn of 22 yrs. last 10 with  doh.. i had to test every week since i would not jab. i can see that healthcare has fallen greatly. i had already been turning to holistic healthcare before this. it s terrible.
i ve noticed a huge decline in not only level of care but also the level of  caring ! this has been widespread in the medical field and beyond.. has spilled over into seemingly all professions. could be the separatist attitude people were infected with.  everyone has germs and are stupid besides me   those who agree with my views  mentality.
i am 71 and still working. i rarely go to the doctor.  i think a person stays healthier that way.  i eat well and i am still strong in body and mind.  please do not lump us into one pot.
critical care rn for many years and you are so right! i use to work at a major hospital in ny city about about 15 yrs ago many excellent doctors that were very patient driven in their care  left. i remember asking one doctor in particular why so many doctors were leaving. he stated that he found it very frustrating with administrators and it was done fighting them.
thank you so much patriot nurse . happy new year to you and  yours.
bingo
the irony is that this same setup has occurred in education.  since the federalizarion of education many principals and teachers either don t care about teaching or just leave yhe profession. thus low standards of education. i suspect there will be a  reason  for other fields of science to lower their standards as well.
i am sick and was waiting for covid mess to be over before getting surgery in 2023. now i know i will die with this condition rather than be abused by the system.
we all know this is true  even if some of us are afraid to admit it.
i am so frustrated right now i am going against the medical establishment here in north carolina because i have been discriminated against where i could not see my own doctor unless i submitted to a covid test which she knew up front that i would never comply for or a vaccination. i also have had numerous other tests done and yet i cannot have a colonoscopy for which i have a history of colon cancer due to the fact that i will not submit to a covid test. i have written a letter and i am going to the top people at unc health to address these matters. i am exempt from wearing a mask and i never have to wear one at hospitals or other doctor s office only at my current doctor s office are they like a mask gestapo there and i am going to put a stop to it. none of this makes sense and i have a medical background where i went to college yet i do not work in my field due to all the covid-19 mandates so i do know what i m talking about and i have done my research. why can i go in a hospital or any other doctor s office and not have to wear a mask and yet at this one doctor s office i am forced to wear a mask  none of this makes any scientific sense. so i am going to probably go against the establishment and since i feel like i have been discriminated against because my own son got to see his doctor in the same building without a covid test the same day as me and my husband were refused to see our doctor so i m really considering suing. i don t wish to do this but i do want to fight for those who are like me and do not want to go along with all the covid-19 crap that the doctors get money for because of all the patents. it s absolutely ridiculous and it makes me so freaking mad. doctors don t seem to care about you like they used to in the old days you are so right about that
my sister has been a nurse for 20 years and i can say for 100  sure the she and her coworkers don t give a f@ck anymore. partly because of the way she and her coworkers are treated by the megacorp health system and partly because of the insanity they have to deal with daily from patients. just like everything else in america the healthcare system is degrading and heading for collapse.
i work in healthcare  and i have to agree with her. i have seen young providers doctors  nurses  pas  nps  google symptoms  order unnecessary tests and send critically ill people home. our hospital is staffed by mostly travelling rns who are not vested in the hospital they work in. it is a horrible field to be in.
bingo. my mom and i are both nurses and you re totally on the same wave length as us.
your not kidding  i went to an urgent care last month. i waited two hours and was told it would be another four before i would be seen because they only had one doctor on duty. i was in so much pain i decided to get an appointment with my doctor. i m still waiting for the appointment and it s not even with my doctor it s a pa
thank you for the info! is it true the unvacced are receiving a lower level of care and pay higher fees
we are being treated by the 2nd steam now. what your saying is very true.
nobody should be left alone in a hospital.  every patient needs an advocate who is willing to be a  mama grizzly.
i may have gone to the doctor 2 times in the last 10 years. first of all  i practice a very healthy diet and still work on my house. house work is work and exercise. plus i do take my dog for a walk. i have suspected most but not all of the very detailed description that you have given of the current status of healthcare in the us  shameful. i have thought of expatriating  but am to much of a woos  and i do have family here. i am a fan and will look for an. if it is affordable may actually purchase some of yourwell founded health advise. last  thank you for telling the truth  wish all the unhealthy and constant dr. office visit folks would listen  they are the ones who need to hear your message the most!
awesome advice hun.
my 15 year old daughter has been terribly sick for 1 and a half months now. what is happening ! it started with strep  then 3 days after being diagnosed with that  she came down with some horrific unexplained virus- severe cough  trouble breathing  agitation  fever etc... took her to the hospital  tested negative for covid  flu and rsv- jump ahead 2 weeks later  she starts feeling better for 2 days- falls terribly ill again  fevers 103   hallucinations  worse cough than before  difficulty breathing etc-  here is where it gets crazy- i take her to the er again and begged them to give her a breathing treatment. they refused  as they had with the previous virus she just had   they test her and she s positive for influenza a  so this is a month and a half of back to back viruses. her body was completely broken down. the nursing staff was absolutely horrific. one said to her   we have actual emergencies to deal with   while she was laying there gasping for air  heart rate through the roof  raging fever etc.. again  i asked for a breathing treatment or even maybe an ativan or something  since she was absolutely terrified. the nurse literally yelled at her and i both! she said to her   we d all like something to make us feel better wouldn t we  but it doesn t work like that . she is still sick. not only is the quality of care absolutely horrible now but the hospitals  urgent cares and dr s offices are incredibly overwhelmed. everyone is so so sick. i have never seen it this bad. people are more sick now and worse off than at the peak of covid and yet no one is batting an eye.
i was in a hospital a couple of months ago  about to have a colonoscopy. i was summarily escorted out when i told the nurse that i didnt  have anyone to watch me after the procedure. i have been living alone in my truck alone since i became disabled a few years ago. the b tch nurse made a huge deal out of this  announcing to the entire hospital  and everyone within 25feet of hearing that i was  homeless .  it was quite embarrassing  i was mortified.  in the past  a nurse might have told the doctor in a low voice  not announced it to the entire world.  i dont know  maybe this did me a favor. i can only surmise that my angels were watching over me  that doing this procedure was not in the cards for now.
what a mess we are in especially in our government.
you re so succinct in what you are saying and 100  right. it all started and had taken a slight hold well before covid. it wasn t noticed per say because it was only happening to the elderly. covid just blew the door wide open to people of all ages. this is truly a terrifying and horrific time in our world. thank you for saying everything i ve noticed and am thinking.
peace be with you and your family
you nailed it sister!!!
the aca turned the corner of patient privacy   doctor self-direction. there was no turning back from med-guv complex ... just wait.  more to come
i was my parents  mama grizzly. dad refused surgery on his aneurysm. i stayed with him 22 hours a day when he was in the hospital because he would try and leave if family wasn t there with him.  i was protecting dad s right to say no to surgery. there wasn t a good chance of him surviving surgery anyway. in his mind  he was reading to go home to heaven and was just waiting for it to go. well  while i was asleep on the futon in his room  the surgeons came in trying to convince dad to have the surgery. dad kept saying no. so they left. i was dead to the world and never heard a thing. the floor doctor woke me up to tell me what happened  and i was furious. i guess they thought i was refusing him from getting surgery. i was with him at the doctor s office when it was being discussed  and dad kept saying no surgery. so it was on his file. his aneurysm did eventually burst  and dad passed. that was in 2015.
wow  how dare they behave that way!!!   that procedure is more risky dangerous than they first let on!   i was scheduled to have an endoscopy   colonoscopy at the same time   the information paper said i must have someone accompany me  which sounded scary! .   if someone simply has to accompany you and stay throughout the procedure  that makes me think there s more risk involved!   i read that the procedure can perforate your colon and you are in big trouble then!   so  yes  i think the lord saved you   thank god the holy spirit began to make me change my mind.   the only complaint i had had was that i was beginning to get some acid reflux.  i didn t see why you should have a colonoscopy for that!   so they can make more     because it s a very expensive procedure! .   anyway  i resolved the acid reflux naturally with herbs and very soon was doing just fine!    i pray for the lord s protection and provision over you  god bless and keep you safe.
yes they have been murdering the eldery with respirators and starvation for at least a decade now
you just said it all! thank you so so much   god bless!
renal failure  dropped blood sugar that won t respond to glucose  blood in urine  pacemaker failure- the er two hours away did nothing for them. if they kept fighting and went to the hospital five hours away  they finally got some care.
comparing my late father s to my late mother s healthcare and my own healthcare over the years. dad always got awesome care. mom always seemed to get lousy care. i had to be her advocate. even my own care has been subpar. no one wants to listen. while my mom was in the hospital after a fall  she had a stroke. i knew something was wrong at the time it was happening. mom wasn t showing the classic signs. i went to the nurses station and demanded a nurse come see her and that something was wrong. 4 rns looked at me like i am crazy. they said the tech will get to her as soon as she can i said i want someone with more thsn a 2 year degree looking at my mom and i huffed back to mom s room. finally an rn came in. it took the hospital 2 days to figure out she had a stroke. by then it was too late to use that special drug for strokes. mom was even telling her doctor the next day that something was wrong because she was dropping everything. he told her she was fine and just needed sleep. sunday  they finally determined she had a stroke. years ago  when she had knee replacement surgery.  she was supposed to get physical therapy....that never happened. the doctor said she could figure it out on her own.  i am so over our healthcare system here in the us. even my care sucks.
didn t know you were i ll  prayers for you. please pray for my wife julie who is suffering from cancer  trying to keep our heads above water but very difficult in todays world. without our faith we couldn t survive this situation. thanks for all you do.
we didn t do jabs after i did the research on the jab. when my son   husband tested   for covid i refused them hospitalization  knew it would kill them both  better off at home  directed their care. used boswellia  b c w  zinc  multivit w  minerals    other healing herbs. they both recovered slowly. i was dealing with a major flareup of several chronic conditions  didn t test for covid as the sx were the same as all of my other flareups. i told them what some nurses were calling remdesivir  run death is near     sent them links to videos on natural care for covid at home  again  they ignored me the first time  so they finally were listening. husband takes some protective rx meds   i have more protective rx than he has  so i was much better off. oh  i also put them on higher doses of vit d  i can t take that - i have familial hypercalcemia   w o taking calcium   magnesium with d  d mobilizes more calcium out of my bones   worsens the hypercalcemia   if i take calcium  same. my multivits have the mdr of d so i always have some on board.. average calcium level i run is between 11   12 when the max is supposed to be 10 but my body is used to it by now. if i go higher  i start hallucinating so have to keep the calcium intake way down . good thing i had more protective rx plus i took famotidine otc. so they recovered at home   faster than i did from the flare ups! l refuse to go to hospitals  i m 70   hubs is 71  prime targets for depopulation because old ppl with chronic conditions are expensive. i want our son to take your course. i have taught him a lot  but he needs to know more. so far he has balked. i know he d be good at it   like it. he already knows a lot from helping me caregive his gram. it s more than just a  screen generation with younger nurses. my generation  boomers  were selfish   raised now into 4 generations of selfish descendents  worse with each succeeding generation. grade inflation means college grads with a masters can t pass an 8th grade graduation test from the late 1800s  even excluding state history questions. they can t read cursive unless they were homeschooled or went to private schools  or their parents made them learn at home. they can only print   can only read printing. i recall i made a list of a couple things i needed for when the nurses came by last hyoercalcemia hospitalization  when the levels came down    they couldn t read it as it was in cursive so i printed it out for them in between treatments. one thing that appalled me was that unvaxxed were denied treatment or given substandard treatment because of their  risky behaviors in not taking the vaccine   yet most  not all  but most  cases of hiv aids are from riskier behaviors   no one would dare say they shouldn t get treatment because they engaged in risky behaviors  so what exactly is the difference  none. so i told those who didn t jab   got that kind of response to ask the same question    they were treated without any more fuss when they did. i said to add to reluctant providers that nursing   medicine say not to be judgmental about their patients  lifestyle choices so they were violating a core tenet of their professions. anyway  going to forward this to the guys so they know why i kept them out of the hospital   will keep doing my best to keep them home. not well enough to stay at their bedsides even were i allowed. that alone makes me suspicious. last yr when i had the hypercalcemia issue  our son wasn t allowed to be with me at all. they claimed a bunch of covid cases   no visitors were allowed. i thankfully had great nurses caring for me. god looked out for me for sure. though i wish nursing staff would quit washing their uniforns in hyper sccented laundry products as i am allergic to most of those fake perfumes. i got real short of breath for no apparent reason but once on o2 i remembered several different personnel with scented clothes on   realized a delayed allergy reaction. benadryl calmed it down along with famotidine  h 1   h 2 blockade also good for slowing or preventing covid . they told staff if they were caring for me  no perfumed laundry allowed   no perfumed soap shampoo powder lotion or perfumes at all - they were all apologetic about it. i asked did they not already have that as a policy  because i was still a bedside nurse when they made it a policy  no perfumed laundry or wearing perfume while on duty   no scented personal products. i had to quit bedside nursing in 1997   the policy was at least 5 yr old by then - was told to go on disability but leveraged the teaching degree   computer wannabe-geek status to get a job less physically demanding. worked for 11 more years before i got too sick period- i was working with at least 6 autoimmune diseases when i quit   went on disability. and i still didn t want to stop working but since i had had several cases of what we called  walking pneumonia  a long time ago  in a sick building  the doctor wanted me to take the old pneumovax. i was getting better   may have been able to do ticket to work but i caved   took the pneumovax    got worse   worse. it ruined what little health i had left. hubs caved   took the new one. a year later he had stage 4b non-hodgkins large b cell lymphoma plus an epithelial bladder cancer totally unrelated to the lymphoma. by god s grace he was healed with chemo. i still believe the newer pneumovax caused that cancer because per the nurses i told about the pneumovax  they double checked their database   since that vax came out  there had been a large increase in those 2 cancers plus they were discovered in a far more advanced stage. so rates of leukemia   lymphoma went up after that vax. now covid jabs are covering that up as all cancers are much more vicious in the jabbed than the unjabbed  there are more new types of cancer    the growth of cancers discovered is very rapid. a nurse friend of mine had the original covid  they refused to accept her documented natural immunity  made her get jabbed   boosted  a week after the 3rd booster  she was diagnosed with a rampant unknown cancer   was dead 2 weeks later. guess the healthcare system got her death benefit added to their profit column  that group life insurance from your job  die before you retire   the facility you work for will get a death benefit since they  insurance  don t have to pay through your retirement as part of the benefit package . thanks for all your videos. so sorry to hear you were sick   glad you re on the mend now.  when i didn t see vids for a while said a prayer for you.
so my family is in the medical profession  they all drank the cool aid. very sad but true. me and one other cuz and that s it  all fully indoctrinated.
thank you that was very beneficial i m facing surgery myself so i need a heads up
my friends husband had a motorcycle accident broke his collarbone in 3 places.. complete fractures  not hairline.  guess what pain meds he was given..vicodin notramadol no.tylenol 3.yep like the dentist gives you for a toothache..we re in deep trouble  people..
i felt and saw this coming back in 2014 while i was enrolled in nursing school. thank goodness i listened to my soul and got the hot dodge out of there. found a much better calling helping others in a more holistic career and haven t looked back.
it s terrible in new mexico. i ve been giving myself ivs three times a week  for over a year  because no help is available.
either providers care or they don t. you cannot pay people to care. caring is a quality. quality people are a rare commodity. in fact  high quality people leave practice because they don t want any part of this mess.
you re right  retired rn here. unbelievable changes seen.
grew up in the medical system. a few good practitioners remain  but those who could retired early or quit.  racist rn in hospital refused refilling my water pitcher saying  you re getting discharged later . big sign telling patients to be respectful of staff-- but nothing about staff being decent to patients.   dignity  that s the first thing to go when an empire declines.  love to all you nurses and doctors who gave me health care...  the relationship and compassion are as important as the treatment
my sister is a rn nurse...has been for 20 years i told her when she started that the whole system would be burned down....so sorry i was right.i take no pleasure in it. that s what these people do.
a tech doesn t have a two year degree  he she has no training or education at all.  the hospital managers cut down nurse numbers and replaced them with techs because they don t think the public can grasp the difference. i doubt their were  4 rns  at the nurses station because most hospitals won t even let any 30 bed medsurg floor have that many nurses on duty. usually it is two or three max. each nurse has a double digit number of patients and no help. techs are worthless.  everytime a family member comes to the rn with something as you did  they are pulling the rn away from a more critical task. if the rn is at the desk it is because her tele patient just went into a bad cardiac rhythm and she has to get him transferred to icu before he gets killed.  or something like that.  if you interfere with her at that time because you want her in your moms room   you could kill that person. so once she is done with that she comes to your mom  calls the doc and it is a long wait for diagnostics etc due to everyone being so short staffed and busy.  the nurse patient ratios are too unsafe for you behave and think as you do. i tell people like you straight up that i have a double digit assignment  no help  and that i am working forward moving from most life threatening problem to least  and you have no right to try and hurt or kill my other patients by trying to control my movements.   no one is being intentionally ignored.
@hycoperosity  not by the nurse  she had her hours increased  her pay cut  and is working a 15 hour day with no food or water to pay for how much more you cost the health care system than what you put in.  but go ahead  take it out on her. the feds got rich off your medicare taxes and the insurance companies got rich off of your insurance payments. they don t care if you lash out and abuse the nurse because they are refusing to fund hospital labor costs and supplies. they really don t  they love it. they are not coming to her aid or yours.
@nicole blackwell  there were 4. the rns at the hospital we were at wear a different uniform than the techs do.
@nicole blackwell  they were all standing there talking and laughing when i arrived. they looked at me like i was crazy.
a rn can be a two year degree and maybe a lot smarter then a 4 year degree. she maybe  older and more experienced. not saying 4 year nurses aren t smart it s just experience is a really big deal also. nurses do stand and laugh at the nurses station to. it is sad about the fact it took so long for them to fin out your mom had a stroke though.
in 2019  before the  c   i went to the er because i had 2 tia s at home. i told them as much. they took my bp  and it was sky high. i was placed in a hallway in triage for roughly 6 hours without ant care or meds to bring bp down before a tech noticed i had been sitting in a chair forever. i finally got an mri  which was clear. at this point the doctor admitted me for observation and told me i really needed a hobby and to attend church  wtf!  moments after getting in a room i had another tia. i called for help  but of course no one came until it had passed. i then felt another coming on  and again called for help. nurse came  i had a stroke while she watched me struggle to speak. she asked my mom  sitting next to my bed   if i normally spoke so garbled. she called an rrt. my vitals remained stable  so they decided to refer me to psych. yep  i had a stroke in the hospital  actually a top tier stroke center  and was treated like i was nuts  until the psych doc came in with his clinical students  proceeded to  show  them i was mental by taking my affected arm and raising it fully and dropping it on my face. ouch. i got a fat lip  then a new mri  which showed stroke damage.  i have lasting damage and pain because they wouldn t listen to me about my body. they insisted they knew my body better than i.
@angie whitley  doesn t surprise me  it can take forever to get a stat ct or mri done anymore.
my husband was a nurse and i am retired rn my husband has multiple conditions and is going blind. he recently had flu severe case and would not go to the er.  he has the idea that us senior citizens are allowed to die if you go there because the political machine can save medicare dollars and social security monies.  he would rather die from that decision  stay home  when he is ill and be with the ones who love him rather than seek outside care that just hasn t been there in a long time in our community.
i am a rn  and  could not agree more with this message .
this has been going on since 2008 according to my observations. and  they  have no problem practically euthanizing the elderly especially if they are not adding to the economy. and that was straight out of a hospitalist s mouth! don t leave your 60 plus family members alone! hire someone to oversee if necessary!
my wife has waited for nearly two years for an abdominal surgery to address adhesions. delays are always blamed on no paperwork that has already been delivered 4 times in person. yep  bullshit every step of the way
thank you and i did pray for you. much love and appreciation.
i ve has medical treatment in nonus countries in the past. it was abhorrent ... welcome to the post-office  i mean-- a guv-gripped medical facility.
@mindy d.  your ordeal makes me so angry.all i can say is i m sorry.
@nicole blackwell  this lady s mom had a life altering stroke whose devastating effects could have been warded off with the proper medical attention.  maybe you have nonstop emergencies.  any time i have been around hospitals  the rn s are gabbing to their coworkers at the floor desk.
@ooohhitskaren 63  that kind of behavior is what i have personally seen in hospitals!  the rn s b. s.  ing with coworkers- but hey  where else can you fob off your  customers  and still get paid well   !
@mindy d.  sorry you experienced such a nightmare. i have experienced it too when i had to have emergency lung surgery. i won t go near a hospital today. they are abysmal hell holes.
@connie c  there are staff at the desk but they are most often not nurses and as non-nurses they are not able to help the nurse.  for example  if you need pain meds  they can tell the nurse  but they cannot get those meds for you themselves. no hospital in the country is staffing up their units with enough nurses to handle critical tasks and then have extra around to hang at the nurses  station.
@connie c  i tried  but after my lawyer promising to take care of it and a deposition by the other side my lawyer called and dropped me like a rock and said unless i signed an agreement not to sue  the hospital would be suing me. pretty sure the hospital padded my lawyers pockets. he said i m not a vegetable  so i m lucky.
@connie c  in their defense you don t know what they are talking about so don t assume it s laughing and cutting up.
@mindy d. omg  how awful!
i agree with him
wow  i could see this topic is very dear to your heart  as it should be. i m sorry your family member was treated so horribly  i guess that s  the new normal   .me personally  i had a minor procedure done tus past summer  same day surgery  and every single person i encountered at the hospital  from admittance all the way to discharge  was as professional  loving and caring as i ve ever experienced. i guess i was blessed. but yeah  i ve heard countless stories to corroborate your words of warning. just recently i heard someone say that after 17 years  they had to find a new doctor because the one who had been caring for him all those years told him he couldn t come to his office any longer if he didn t take the vaccine  unbelievable that you can t even trust the one person you should be able to trust most
i worry about you sometimes--your so intense and sensitive.  hope you get some fun now and then.
the failure i am seeing in the medical industry is criminal.  the meds given were one cause of pancreatitus  abdominal sepsis  and a near bleed out death.  they never scoped the gi tract which would have identified the breach in the lower esophogus upper stomach right in the vascular area.  this is a known side affect of one of the prescribed meds. they missed everything prior to this.  were even going to send the person home the next day. had he not ruptured when he did  he would have been home and died.the failures continued.once questioned and a conversation with council occured in front of them.  they began to do better.keep up spreading the truth.  spoken in honesty.  god bless and stay safe.
i have a close contact who said they re so short staffed they are brining in 1000 nurses from the philippines to cover it. it s a logistical nightmare
i was looking online at  home doctor  practical medicine for every household  the other day... lo   behold... my daughter gave it to me yesterday as a belated christmas present!!
they murdered my brother putting him on a vent and taking him of it because he didn t need it. talked to a contractor who came to the house they tried putting his wife on one and she was pregnant.  thank god he said no because they wouldn t have survived. that beautiful baby would not be here now. i won t go to the hospital unless i m already dieing.
hello good to see you posting again. my husband and i were blessed to find a doctor that was local and i would assume fairly new because she is only 30. she was kind and concerned she gave us options and when my husband went in for his first appointment she asked me if i had any questions for her regarding my husband s health. she also was not pushy about us not getting the  hokie pokie  we told her no and she said ok. she is wonderful but she has just moved from michigan to colorado so we will not have her anymore. i hope that we can find another doctor soon just incase something comes up that requires more than what we can do on our own.
glad to see you are back and doing well
god bless  patriot nurse. happy new year.
there has been........ even the way they diagnose people.  the health professionals don t care and there is no standard.  and i definitely see that they ve bought into the party narrative.  because of that  i decided to switch care providers.
much love   blessings to you pn
i retired in 2019 after being forced to attend and play a part in a mock panel remix in oct. 2019..... i resigned right after that! i work now in a doctors office setting up scripts and faxing info for dmes! woe to the ill!
love you and your channel! thanks for doing what you do! 5 of my family members were exterminated by a hospital in 7 weeks. my parents were in a hospital and weren t allowed to leave. they snuck out and a nurse helped my mom get out.....horror story. this was summer 2021.
thank you patriot nurse and have a blessed new year!
much of what is changing in the healthcare industry is actually profit greed driven  and actually not all that new. what we are seeing now is merely the most recent iteration of what has been going on over the last almost 30 years  but due to the pressures brought on by covid have become more pointed and shocking  and much harder to avoid. healthcare as an industry is sick  and if it continues on it s present course may very well collapse or  even worse  implode upon itself .
had my hip done  out patient  all done well. wanted to do sooner than latter before they ran out of people and medicines. would not go into the hospital.
when i turned 60 my health started a noticeable decline. i now have to be in the office every 14 days for injections. my health care costs quadrupled in 2022 and afraid what will happen in 2023.
thank you hun god bless you and keep you healthy and safe this year !thank you for all you hard work dear!
i stopped even going to my oncologist!  i just lost all trust in all these doctors.  besides that i rarely even seen any of my doctors i was always seen by some half baked np or pa.
oh my goodness i literally just told my brother about not being able to trust the medical field and institutions anymore and he looked at me like i had 3 heads! and on a side note he did not know what remdesivir  is and that it was protocol for any patients  exhibiting covid symptoms .
my bro s an rn who worked in an er for 10yrs  so i m better than most. my ex is also an er nurse  as is one of my best friends.
mock panamdemic
they weren t allowed to leave  that s against the law. please see an attorney.  they absolutely cannot hold people hostage.
yep. one of them read m6 husband s scans wrong and other patients too. we re in trouble
thank you for telling the truth.
if you have something that s needs severe medical treatment look into going to another country. they still use real medicine and some are even holistic in their approach specially in europe. plus it cost less than this killing country. stay safe and look into home remedies. i had covid back in jan 2020 before they knew what it was. i did my own research and wound up taking some of my dogs meds and i believed they worked or at least made it somewhat better. get some books by known people with history it really works. it s how i got relief for ulcerative colitis. after two yrs on the expensive shots that did not work i found a yt vid from japanese doctors that talked about what they were doing i tried it and it worked. by the way it was just pepzin zinc and magnesium. imagine cheep over the counter supplements. stay safe and open your eyes. love you girl!
if it aint broke  fix it till it is  . the one thing that government is very good at.
got pissed at dr telling me to go to urgent care so they could write a script to get tested  for an issue that i was in the local er two nights 10 days before and the discharge was follow up with dr... without a fresh blood test there was no way to know if the meds had worked or not... told her to piss off as it was ridiculous!!! found a new doc from nigeria - wow wow wow... she understands providing actual care. needed new blood test to compare to er labs. she didn t like what she saw and had me have another blood draw 3 hr later  pita going back to have it done  but two hours later she calls and tells me to get to er.. personally called to followed up next day and ordered additional bloods and 3 hrs after draw calls me then script to pharmacy.. so damn nice to find a doctor who actually cares about me not the  business  profits.
my father was recently at his cardiologist and the cardiologist stated to him about his refusal to take a statin medication   well i don t have a gun just a stethoscope  so i can t make you take them.  my fathers labs came back perfectly fine. my question to the cardiologist  if you did have a gun would you force me to take something i don t need
dr peter breggin of the american institute of psychiatry addressed the problematic biological harm that occurs in the human body and more specifically the damaged to the brain and vital organs after doctors prescribed psychotropics.   he started his medical practice over 50 years ago and has treated literally hundreds of patients without pharmaceuticals.
may the lord jesus bless you and keep you.  thank you patriot nurse. zimbabwe
several times the lord helped me heal  when i saw the doctors couldn t. exercise faith for your needs...he is able to heal you and or direct you to help.
i know people in canada who treat themselves rather than going to the er.  an example is closing a wound with super glue instead of getting stitches.
my last surgery had no follow up because i would not wear a mask. i will probably only see the dentist for cleanings as far as health care goes.
our healthcare system is so broken
i firmly believe take care of your liver and your body will follow.  this knowledge was gained by adhering to the li kung s liver detox program.  but  since inflation is driving up the cost of ingredients  i compensate by consuming other detox foods.  a lot of preparation time is needed to produce each recipe.  plus like i said food prices have spiked.
problems started further back  when doctors started participating in the drg  diagnosis related group  system forty years ago.  this let insurance companies start herding doctors like sheep  and incrementally demand and dictate more and more subservience.  money for the management  and to hell with everyone else.
yeah i tell people all the time.  things are not the same anymore.  healthcare. supply chain. customer service.  transportation.  most people just stare at me.
thank you for your  heads-up and advice.
as a registered respiratory therapist of  25yrs   i  agree.
so nice to see you again patriot nurse!  i missed you   prayed for you when fm told you were very sick!  i admire your intelligence   we need you!  you go girl!
that just goes along with the decline of the human race. kids in most cases are not raised with any moral compass. most people   a lot of them are in church every sunday   do not give a damn about anyone besides themselves. there are still some good people out there. when i was out for my walk yesterday  a lady driving by stopped  to ask me if i had a nice christmas.
are these patients dealing with the results of having gotten the clot shot  or dealing with covid  or just health card in general i had a good friend that was in her mid 40 s that had to be admitted into the hospital. and i have no doubt that their protocols killed my friend.
medical kidnapping was going on when my kid was ill over 15 years ago.
our civilization is broken in every way
@tom stulc  absolutely
i wonder if they put something in the water. wtf is going on
thanks for this.  hard truths.  happy new year!
thank you    happy new year ! to you all.
we ve had 2 family hospital er visits  and were shocked at the 13 hr waits only to be brushed off by the doctors and cruelness of employees! zero help.
spot-on. sadly  some people don t get the   and political connection -- marcus welby etc no longer exists and now we are talking medical expertise based upon  equality  not  knowledge and expertise.
clearly the lord has you here for a time such as this your clear and succinct presentation was refreshing and at the same time alarming! the asleep sheeple need to wake up! thank you for trying may our loving god have mercy upon us. blessings. maranatha.
i have been waiting 8 months for a appointment for a hole in my macula. when they did book a meeting an hour from my home and i m blind the meeting was not properly booked....they could care less..then to uber back there was no phone reception and i was an hour from home in a big giant health care building with no amenities. in the middle of no where. the woman that i called that monday to check if the meeting had been qualified and they said yes. they treated me like crap..made me sit there an hour to see if the doc would fax the info...blind in the middle of no where.......i fell apart...screamed at the top of my lungs where is my uber...my parents are dead there is no one...... but the docs they dont care....get lost.
where do all the moral caring nurses and doctors go to work  that s where i want to be a patient.
she tells the truth and if you are old god help you.
alice  i love watching your channel. sorry  you haven t felt well. thankfully you know how to take care of yourself. due to medications in part and stamina and fortitude  our small town has a hefty population of elderly people. the elderly do more in our town than the younger population. there are many octogenarians that function like 50 year olds. we take home remedies  aspirin and vitamins  exercise and eat right. actually  geriatrics is a scam. the medical system make a lot of money off of the elderly. happy new year!
pn  this is an amateur opinion...but i think a lot of people are  overweight  because they have eaten transfats since the day they were born. now these folks are aged and ill. but i think some veggies might help. i had a diet book from like the seventies that i bought for a quarter  one of those you get from the grocery store check out gondola. i got another good book on nail care from the same place. i usually do not put much stake in those but they are pretty good. it was a book on dieting and eating veggies and what each one did. one veggie  i thought had an effect  on transfat in the body  no proof maybe it was my imagination  was radishes. it did not say this in the book  but something stood out with the radishes. the greens are edible too. this is not medical advice and research all info thoroughly and consult your physician.
i m a travel nurse and i can count on one hand of american nurses here in the midwest all  contract nurses -contract nurses are imported from other countries on govt programs-there are about 1 buck cheaper  but get scholarships help with housing etc best advice which i am working on is get out of nursing  i like nursing but hate healthcare
thepatriotnurse524k subscribers and growing keep up the great work.
i m thinking of subscribing to concierge medicine. even if it costs 5k a year on top of fees  it s worth it.
my original oncologist retire  the new oncologist is a a   wipe. gave me a bunch of bull sht because i wouldn t take the vaccine. i found a different oncologist who is very understanding  the old one wouldn t release my medical records. i had to get my insurance company and a lawyer involved. he said he owned my records. i have them now he did however caused a delay in treatment. i was in the hospital for an unrelated procedure and he showed up in my room  i tossed him out. he wrote a new order and the nurse on duty caught it and my doctor who resined the order. it was to administer the vaccine.
people who care more about doing a tiktok video than their patients. in years past  when i was in the hospital the nurses made all the difference in the quality of care i received. now  i m not so sure some might actually make it worse due to them not having that empathy you mentioned.
healthcare went from a family doctor taking care of booboos to an industy that gobbles up money at a riduclous rate.i have only spent 3 days in hospital my entire life and it was a miserable experience. they charged my insurance almost 28 000 for 3 days of torture  lousy food and a bed i wouldn t make a homeless person sleep on. i could have stayedat a 5 star resort for that much money! i hope i never have to repeat that experience.
thanks for posting this. it explains alot
i read that those who get that  thing  in their arm are cold emotionally cuz it changes their personality.
do you still offer the classes and how do we sign up for them   ty
at all costs  it now more important than ever to stay out of hospitals  go outpatient if you must.
that is wonderful that you have such a vibrant older population in your town!  do you mind if i ask where your town is located  what state
@byzantine ladybug  i would like to know also!
alice  we live near idaho. the town only has a restaurant and post office. a very small town.
it s being done by design. by the time the reason is revealed it ll be too late.
@miki miki  yep
those who did the tic-toc videos were not busy.  i have never seen that many staff members in a major hospital in intensive care take even a lunch break at the same time.
so true. we re here now and my husband was just complaining about his bed. so far 100k was charged after surgery and hospital stay  i bet it s another 150k to 200k not including future treatment. disgusting
yes! i agree with your report.i fired my doctor of 25 years after he asked me during a check up in june of 2020 that i should get the jab. i told him i should sue him for proposing i take an experimental drug. i then searched for an independent doctor  not affiliated with a hospital  and one that does not participate in  mychart  or anything similar in medical records.  your healthcare info is stored in these  software  services and they can be accessed by any healthcare provider and the government.  i read this in the fine print of these companies.  thankfully i found a great doctor who does not participate in the national charting companies and is in agreement with me on the jab. god bless you in the coming year patriot nurse and may all your subscribers turn to him.
will or do you already have online training of what you teach in person in a video format   when i get the funds i hope to take your classes but am unable to be gone from my home for more than 8 to 9 hours at a time because i have dogs.  what are your thoughts on taking supplements like juice   asea and medical mushrooms and the like.  thanks for all you do.
blessings galore to you  pn  in 2023.
before cv husband had gall stone went to state hospital 5 dr s tried to talk him into removing we said no  after the dr gave up the nurse told us the stone passed per xray
thank you for speaking the truth
this is bad i have only been in hospitals due to injuries  but it seemed the nurses were the only ones who cared. the doctor always seemed to be an arrogant d-bag. if we lose the caring nurses the whole thing is crap
i just quit my icu job after 17 years.   i m done.  she is spot on
god bless you patriot nurse.
thank you for everything
every word is true  i can assure you  as an rn for 25 years  and a physician assistant for 13 years before retiring every word is true.  i recommend a good naturopath .
thank you for being one of us.
a doctor physically abused my son right in front of me. she triex t force a knee to butt post opp of a level 4 tibea break and was furious that the pt wasn t doing the same. i threw a fit.  i was threatened to loose insurance support if i changed doctors.       we found out later it was due to infection in the incision..he now still has a deep scar and permanent nerve damage...praise god he can walk and has grown at least 6  .  he was 13 and 5 4 .  now 16 and 6 1 .  he walks with a slight limp but it is all praises to god that he s ok.
our country as we ve known it - is lost. see the movies  hunger games    gattaca    1984  and others to see the future. after the past 2 years of tyranny and facism  literally right there chrome google just tried to autocorrect  facism  into  racism  for me  at 54 and as a highly discriminated against white male i am looking forward to an end of my time on this rock. bless you patriot nurse for your efforts. you are a special lady.
bang on!!! this is canada too. god bless you patriot nurse
can i ask you how you went about finding a doctor without all the government control . my parents need one
this is why we don t want government involved in our healthcare.  finding a clinic where you work with the same doctors is getting harder and harder
so much heart. my best to you. wishing the best fou you. personally i will never use a hospital again. i would rather loose than depend on tyrant s to save me.
thank you this was very helpful.
i had surgery for prolapsed bladder and it didn t come out right! my bladder is extremely low  i am having uti infections and i cannot get the doctor that did the surgery to listen to me! i have back pain and pain on my sides! it s all wonderful unless there s a problem and then they don t want to listen to you! stay away from the hospitals and all surgery unless absolutely necessary! i no longer trust them!
i see this same phenomena in mental health .  i have been a counselor since 1985 and would not go anywhere near the field now . i am fortunate to be in private practice   and cannot believe what i am seeing taught and practiced in the counseling now . appalling .
so years ago  i was given paxil for anxiety.  i was on it fir 1 or 2 weeks and began having wierd feelings when i would move my head fast. like i would move but the feeling would kind of rachet over  if that makes sense.  hard to explain. anyway. i didn t like the way it made me feel so i stopped taking it. my doc seemed surprised that i was ok after  stopping it cold turkey.  he ended up putting me on escitalopram  sp  and that dealt with the anxiety and also took those wierd movements away. fast forward 22 years. i don t belive i have anxiety anymore but have continued to take the lexapro because it deals with the movement feeling  its really awdul . however. i only take maybe 1 or 2 a week. only when i feel the weirdness. i take 1 or 2 and it goes away for a week or two. now i have to go to doc every year for checkups so i can get it refilled. i ve probably only used 4 or 5 perscription bottles in the last year..  trying to do research on how to deal with movements but there is nothing out there on this that i can find. i m positive paxil did this but very hard to prove and not interested in moving forward on anything with them. but really don t want to be on meds for the rest of my life to control it. i ve looked into herbs and oils but haven t found anything yet to help. anyone have any ideas on where to look   thanks. and thank you patriot nurse for your truth!  we are stocked on tons. just not sure what to do with this one.
well i know you are a good one and there are some left. they were awesome to my dad in icu.  comfort care  treated him like garbage and he was dying of course. im a chronic pain patient also  and i just have one thing to say. fk this medical system and peoples non chalant attitudes.
@tyler will  good to know.  i hope i can make them go away and stop the meds.  i hate going to the doctor.  that s where people get sick.
i have lost faith  if i ever really had any to begin with  in every institution in our country. medical  educational  legal and law enforcement. i just examine the evidence like a sober person and operate on what my eyes show me and what these charlatans tell me.
i have never trusted doctors! my brother was a chiropractor that practiced nutrition for health. he called them drug pushers. i go to a doctor only if no other choice. i get what i need from them and leave never take the unnecessary tests. oh most important pray before you go to see a doctor!
pn is correct.... from my point of view this has been coming for several years  the human malware program 19 just brings it into common knowledge now  i started working in healthcare back in early 70s as a military field medic  they then sent me to nursing school ect...   wife is a nurse too  fact is our whole family are medical...   that said-  the just in time supply is broken. the average nurse is well over 55-60 years old now.  a few years ago our grown daughter had appendicitis and was septic. once we realized this i talked her into going to the clinic as she was afraid to go to the er. it was almost lunch time when we got there. the people at the front desk knew that i would not have done this as a walk in unless something was really wrong! the nurse who came out  she was new  tried to tell us us to go to the er.....      lucky for her that the front desk called back and one of the older staff intervened and roomed us. after vital signs ect were done she went out and got the chief of staff md. he came in and started off with my daughter-- you know your dad and i used to work together for years  says he. a few minutes later he says for us to go on to the er and he would call them to make the arrangements  which is why we went to the clinic- it makes things easier for us  by the time we got there we were roomed right away and the surgeon  who i had worked with before  saw her within 45 minutes and she was in the or within  2 hours....  had we just gone to the er cold  it would have taken many hours of fighting to get her taken care of. -----   pn is correct in everything she said in this episode. the lack of thinking skills is very lacking in the newer crop of healthcare providers.  that is not meant to be a blanket statement as there are many who are great- more on that later   flash forward to last year my wife and i both got sick and spent a week in icu over it. in talking peer to peer with 2 of our doctors  one was very left and the other was very right  both of them after looking around to make sure nobody else could here us  stated the cdc ect were lying to them about how to treat our conditions so they were just winging it in treating us. what they were doing was working and every step of the way  we did collaborate on the care. ----   staffing issues both hospitals in our town are and have been short staffed mostly due to political and policy reasons ....  many of us are getting or have gotten out over it.  supplies issues- most if not all of the medical  and medications  materials manufacturing has got to be brought back within our own borders  regardless of what country you live in  there are already massive shortages including medications that are critical to continued life of many people.  recently certain antibiotics were in short supply and some were just not available at all  so 2nd or 3rd tier meds were are substituted...  get the stuff you will need on hand at your home while you can! learn how to care for your family. ----   abuse   neglect related to health care is really there... get or be your advocate. re-listen to pn from about 12 minutes in to the end......    herbs are often just as good and sometimes better than the stuff from the pharmacy but only if you can and do grow your own. otherwise they are just as vulnerable to supply line problems .   things are getting real and interesting-which is not good news.-- long about 3-5 minutes in where pn is talking about the pressure from gov at many levels.....  when you have to have their permission  via a license to practice your profession  to be gainfully employed to feed your family and your self  most will either toe the party line or leave. example there was an md in washington or oregon was interviewed on tv in 2020 an he  foolishly  stated that neither he nor any of his staff had been wearing masks during the mandated time..... within about a week the state board of medicine revoked his license to practice.  he could not work and his clinic was closed down so all of his staff were out of work too.....
i ve gotten off of everything except  armour desiccated thyroid for hashimoto s. every time i try to wean off of it my energy tanks hard.     stocking up best i can.
100  pn.  i ve seen this through my own cancer journey.  i m in remisson now but the care that i received in the beginning  before the mandated you know what  and afterwards is like night and day. in the beginning  they were very caring and helpful. afterwards  i was actually told not to research my condition and that s part of what i do for a living.  they even tried to force evusheld on me.  i m afraid every time that i go in for a maintenance treatment that they are going to sneak something in.
we have had that type of experience w my son-in-law s father in the hospital this year. they don t care at all.
i am unable to elaborate on specifics  but i ve witnessed these things firsthand. the only reason i stay is that yhwh has not directed me on a different path yet. i feel i am charged with the duty of holding line being here. hold until relieved. i am serving a purpose of being a bit stillness in someone else s storm. i do not take my unique position lightly. i feel impassioned for creating exemplary care of those that i am charged with their care. shalom
just in time  jit inventory it s nothing new. it was a concept taken from japan from the 80s.. i was involved in its infrastructure  manufacturing latter part of the 80s. anything that could be a pro turns into a con such an awesome video great insight thank you
god bless you for speaking the truth you are a spiritual warrior as well as a warrior on the earthly battlefield you are doing god s work by issuing a warning you are a watchman on the wall you are an angel indeed god bless you my friend i will spread your video and your message far and wide maybe we will start taking much better care of ourselves using homeopathic remedies and herbal medicines anything to avoid the beast system of today s hospitals
very good patriot nurse!
i am not jabbed  i deal with the va for my medical care. they are completely hostile toward people like mr and it has only gotten worse over the past 30 months.
you look great! glad you re feeling better!!
one of the best videos i ve ever watched !
you just confirmed what i d already thought.
at what point will people wake up to the insurance fraud in this country  we pay upfront for awful healthcare  and the bureaucrats chisel down the providers  while we get worse and worse treatment. consolidation of hospitals has accelerated the situation.
couldn t get narcs for my dog post op.  it was horrible watching her suffer.  vet had rx lowest dose of gabapentin. full dose was better but not effective pain treatment
i have always been afraid of hospitals and doctors...most don t know what they are doing...just want to give meds. i stopped over 50 years ago trusting the medical field. i research as much as possible and try to stay healthy. i am lucky that i have good dna  mind and body health  happiness and have no meds. again  i have been lucky because i have not very often needed medical services. today i am very leery of going to a doctor or into a hospital.
is the herb class available online  would love this!!
i ve just received the diagnosis of aneurysms bone cyst  only solid mass tumor  aggressive  in my tibia. there is urgency to do surgical removal before it destroys bone to point i end up with a fracture. i ve seen the x ray s so can visually see the cause for concern.so  to hear this news  knowing i m in a position where i cannot see a way to self treat  i tried that and either this tumor is legitimately aggressive or i managed to accelerate its grow rather than cause it to shrink  i fear the idea of placing my health and life into the hands of a broken down system  especially when i don t see another choice  as i cannot see my way to letting this go untreated  given its eating up my bone.....
many years ago i went to the doctor to have my asthma medication prescriptions renewed.  my female doctor refused to renew my prescriptions until i had a mammogram.  i refused the mammogram again and wrote a letter to the hospital board of directors.  within a couple weeks that doctor was no longer employed there.  10 years later they still havent killed me with breast cancer treatments.  thank you father god for your protection.
if the cdc was lying to them about how to treat the condition  why didn t they publicly expose them !  why didn t all the doctors expose them
@repent  jesus is coming soon!  when you have to have a license issued by the state to earn a living and it took you anywhere from 4 to 12 years to earn that license  the real threat to that license has a very chilling effect on how loud the whistle gets blown....   i do not blame them for not coming out publicly....  it would be like cutting off their noses to spite their faces....  they were very brave to have shared their concerns privately with me!
@eric blair  i m sorry  but people s lives need to be the priority!!!!
i was having that issue with the va also. so i reported the nurse  physician to the medical board of my state for harassment  it stopped.
i wanted to add from that point on  ive managed to stockpile 6 months worth of meds just in case i get another crazy doctor..
thank you for sharing pn!
great video. i ll at least remind my relatives to stock up on basic drugs.
what is really needed is independent clinics run by good people who care even if it s just a basic health clinic for simple procedures and minor issues locally we have people who quit or were fired for not accepting the untested jab each community has enough qualified medical people to man these needed independent clinics .just need a plan blessings for all of us in these last days
hi patriot nurse  met you at the formal in blue ridge last year. had a great convo at the dinner table with you  good to see you.
i must say sadly  you are spot on.
have bot seen a doctor for 26 years  best choice i made. yes   i had insurance.
2023 the truth community needs to come together like never before
i watched my grandmother die 5 weeks after her second shot. went home feeling ill  spent 3 weeks deteriorating in bed and then died 2 weeks later in the hospital.
gave nurse to nurse report and the nurse i was speaking with sat there playing a video game.  i stopped and asked her to put it down. response was nothing but lip. yes. patriot nurse i have been telling friends and family for years they must  have an advocate who is by their side  always.
terrifying god bless everyone
thanks for your instruction. god bless you. get well.
i clicked on the link to your online course and i m getting a  forbidden  error message.  anyone else getting the same issue
what is your suggestion for cancer patients  i ve got a hypermetabolic destructive lesion on the right occipital condyle of my cranium. i m set to start hormone therapy soon. thank you!
i have pernicious anemia and i m told it s not reversible and i ll need to take b12 injections for the rest of my life. any suggestions if my b12 becomes unavailable
i am a cna.  i know it is not much but i would say i work in healthcare on a daily basis. as a cna i can say that the standard of care is abominable.  i know i need to step up more and quit making excuses but it is easier said than done when you are paid like crap and have such great expectations put upon you.  i will take some responsibility here and say that i need to step up and do my best regardless of my pay rate  however  this system will never truly improve unless tbis issue is addressed. i really care about your family members that i am caring for and want to provide them the best care if not just adequate care but this job is soul sucking.
i m 68 and do not have a so called health care provider  i take only vitamins and supplements  it drives my supplemental medicare provider nuts  they don t understand why i don t have a  bunch of prescriptions and are always wanting to do an in home health check up.
still beautiful as ever! keep up that good fight sister and thank you
i was abused in the hospital this past september by a nurse she did some horrible things to me and then she pulled my pubic hair out by a hand full and laugh and said this is groovy i had went through surgery they had to remove a knee and hip replacement and put in spacers because i got sespic and about died
happy new year! may you be blessed with happiness and health in the new year
bless you for helping us.
so sorry for your loss of your grandmother
@debbie hopper    surreal how nobody in my family wants to make the connection. my aunt  nona  mom and dad all in one house. i had moved out. i found out in the final two weeks.. a few days after she passed it hit me..  did she get the shots!   i go ask my aunt she pulls out the paper work  when i saw the date  the brand  moderna  i see the paper from the first shot says pfizer. my aunt is a very sensitive woman so i contained my  wtf s!!  i go to my mom and dad calmly and they look at me confused when i asked..  you don t see the connections here!     went home sick didn t get outta bed    you thought  oh we better call the ambulance she looks bad or that you weren t supposed to mix brands!    surreal .. they were very annoyed and in denial. twilight zone shit
that s shocking and infuriating
sorry but all the nurses that i have in my family and friends did not go into nursing because of money. they went in because they loved taking care of people. so if your doing it for money then we can see where your heart lies....
patriot nurse you are so correct. i have a b.s. in kinesiology  took care of my mother   father in their last years including healthcare decisions. far too many times the care providers did not have my parent s best interest in mind. this is especially true if the hospital is in a less affluent side of town. i demanded my father s doctor leave the hospital room  because he had zero compassion and was just a medicare assembly-line doctor. see as many patients as possible. he was a quack.     i haven t seen a doctor  in person  in over four years. i ve used the phone-video appointments with doctors   nurse practitioners three times for minor stuff. two of them were very good  while the last one was on the covid   shot kick. i ve never been tested or received the gene therapy. my whole 57 years i have been an extremely healthful person who rarely gets ill. it s just the way i have been. my primary care doctor is still afraid the meet patients in person. worthless.
my sister quit her rural tx hospital and works private duty for a lady who can pay for it.
super advise   lovely lady . wish i was in knoxville  from ireland  xxx
this was the strangest video for me. my next-door neighbor is 67 years old she has been locked up in her apt trying to be a nurse online. she is locked up day and night. and she is mean......has attacked me in the back yard with plastic trash can...and more. she is very mean. i think she is in an unrealistic situation of failure. and she in the 10 years i ve known her has never dropped one tear. i think it is a man. so all screen time for her. she is not someone i would ever want in times of being sick and ill. she is a grifter  no family....i would say nicer things if she was nicer....but i m in a bad situation with her on the other side of the wall....so the things your saying is crazy parallel
sounds exactly like teachers   the public education system
spot on report....   thank you!!
pn  you are a blessing to many thousands. your caring and empathy shines for all to see... those that have been blessed with eyes to see. it s clear you put others ahead of yourself and the pain in your heart shows through. please be sure you take care of yourself kind woman... so those with whom you cross paths might benefit from your caring and wisdom for many years to come. i ve followed you for several years now and i  and i m sure many others can quite honestly say  this age needs a strong you
definitely  take care of your health  mainly eating right  eating less  will do the trick.  then attempt the exercise and extrication.
happy new year  and god continually bless.  thank you for sharing so much.
no kidding i have been waiting for over two weeks for some thyroid medicine it s ridiculous
wow heavy duty. i will definitely have to watch it again. thank you so much for what you do. it s kinda scary out there but thank you jesus you are jehova rapha our healer
i recommend a trip to mexico to buy antibiotics   ivermectin  doxycycline  hydroxychloriqin  vitamin   minerals . yes i done patriot nurse class   recommend it!!!
i had a doctor insist that i get the shot for  coof . i finally told her that god told me not to get it. she finally backed off. my wife got jabbed  i didn t. we both got sick. she spent 10 days in the hospital. i didn t.
praying you continue to improve
there seems to be ongoing issues with health care.  either it is expensive insurance  mandatory vaccines and staffing and training shortages. i do not know where pn lives however for me in ocala florida  my care with the va health has been very good.
i hear you say lifestyle changes.  my mom has ms  with a foley cath.  utis are a problem.
i was wondering   i had my thyroid radiated 10 years ago.  i am on medication everyday.  what can i take naturally for this. this is of great concern to me
my buddy cut his thumb with his chop saw.  went to the er.  sat bleeding in pain in the er for 4 1 2 hours before they would see him!  horrible!
thank you for this analysis. fyi  the same thing is happening in britain s nhs and the canadian healthcare system. it s global  and being driven by powerful transnational forces.  ephesians 6 12.
another great program my friend.  be well.
me too!!!! radiated in 1991 .btw the levothyroxine i take is no longer working all they wanna do is keep increasing the dosage even the endo docs. unexceptable.
where do i find the classes. and what meds do you recommend having on hand
i see what she s saying with the younger people.
this almost makes me cry. so  so sad.
how do i enroll in your online medical class to avoid the er  thanks
i am so sorry your loved one has had to suffer in this way. at the same time  i feel this message is about 20 years too late. i could have told you this 15-20 years ago. i was almost abused by a nurse as a young teen  and as a young adult caregiving for the elderly  i saw some dastardly things done in the name of medical care.
nurse  i ve been listening to you for a long time. you re wits and you re being so articulate is a character like no other. i d like to marry a gal just like you. 90 of women today have drank the feminist cool aid.
thanks for sharing  ! hope you feel better soon..
my 58 yr old wife had her right lung collapse spontaneously twice in one week post the jab. followed by sepsis putting her into a cardiac care unit for a week in critical care unit with sepsis in may. its december now. she s not the same since. her health s went down hill n her mind has slipped a lot. this is a non smoking non drinking person. then she got covid  hard to boot this past year post jab. now she has post covid problems. bs of a jab. still got covid  long term symptoms.
my primary care doctor retired last july because he wasn t going to provide transgender medical care because of his christian faith. so sad we lost him.
i was in china for almost a month. i did not notice even 1 obese person the whole time.
one of the problems i have is many employers mandate a doctors note for return-to-duty. there is also many professions that require medical certifications for access to said profession. we can only run so long before we have to face the big three choices  join them  be enslaved by them or fight them.
if we stock up on medications  say antibiotics  are they really expired  and dangerous  after the expiration date  say years after  is there a resource on how long meds last
my daughter is a liberal extremist and a nurse . she is in the perfect job . working at the health department under government control and having no love for either the job or the people she sees . comforting   is it not
who controls the medical industry in the us  that s who we need to go after and put them on notice...
in some countries the solution is migration of health care professionals international students visas doing health care training  to a road to residency visa aka green card
the u. s. healthcare system is and has been a f-ing joke for the past 35 years  if not more  i walk into my civilian doctors office today  and yes  staff are nice  but i often leave feeling like a number. yet  on the other side of this coin i walk into any va clinic or front line hospital  and i feel the genuine concern for veterans that is not seen in the civilian sector  why is this  let me tell you a quick story. six months ago  i went to my civilian dr.  asking him if ozempic would help with my a1c weight loss  at that time i weighted 235 lbs  and my a1c was 7.1.  also  i have been eating much better daily walking for the last few years  but never really lost weight. the dr. flatly said no  without much dicussion.  a week or two had passed and i went to the va  and met with my diabetic staff member who as it turned out checked my medical record and within two weeks i was on ozempic. needless to say  since this time had passed my a1c has dropped down too 5.9  i have never had my a1c this low  as for the weight loss  remember i was 235 when i started this  and as of three days ago my current weight is 194 lbs  and i feel fantastic. ty.
oh how right you are pn. i had a surgeon tear my insides up with hernia mesh and now i spend my days frequenting a pain clinic for the last ten years. i experience everything you just said  i never took the clot shot and i can see how differently i m treated there  all they care about is shooting me up with steroids ever other month. something i can t afford and does not help but ti make the rest of my joints messed up now but they don t care. thank you for hitting on this subject  god bless you sweet lady
get off sugar   refined  processed foods! do intermittent fasting. go for walks. take responsibility for your own health.
political weaponization  absolutely.  my dr. told me that i need to watch more cnn  when i refused the jab.  since then  she does the minimum  and rushes thru it.
we are living in a nightmare.  are these the end times   it makes me wonder.
have 3 hernias 1 small by belly button2 by groin area  have some pain now and then and not allowed to do any core adominal exercises but the doctors  and a friend who is a nurse all want me to get the mesh surgery   i looked it up and decided against getting it then  this way a yr before cvd now i wont even go see a dr. because i know that they all will pressure me to get the jab which i wont do. so i worry if i go to the hospital for something they would sneak the jab in my iv or give it to me while under anethsiea for emerency surgery or simply have them tell that it has been made law that everyone must take the jab and have security detain me until jabbed  so no more doctors or hospitals for me unless i pass out on the street. been studing natural medicines for years now   thats the only way for me and it is the best way   got real mad when they made quinine illegal for over the counter buy use to use if for all my colds and flus since i was a kid now 64 yrs old. never trust your doctor they are nothing but paid flunkes to big pharma and insurance companies  was once told by a caring doctor who had retired that if a doctor knows 10 different treatments for your illness but  the hospital only uses 3 of them then he cant tell you about the other7 or he will be fired.
@hycoperosity  let me tell ya  i understand and it is the mesh that is the culprit. since 2012 i ve seen numerous surgeons  been to california  florida twice  and maryland. one of the surgeons in florida would have taken it out and try to reconstruct my groin but he said i would likely lose my bladder  nerves and a couple other man parts and on top of that end up in a wheelchair. so here i am barely able to walk  digestive problems  bladder and bowel problems not to mention unrelenting chronic pain and doctors that are clueless. did i mention i ve ended up in the er 4 times in the past bcoz i ve had blood settling in my groin and was told that s normal what!!! in the past ten years i ve had 7 mri s 9 ct scans 3 ultrasounds and everything is  normal  and they know how to do is push pills at you  so sweetie i understand what your husband is going through and you re going through it with him. i have a friend that specializes in medical implants and i sent her my post op and she said  jay  you didn t even have a hernia let alone a double hernia. yeah  looks like the great surgeon was selling mesh that day and i was his customer. god bless you and your husband  i will pray for you both.
dr. kevin peterson las vegas removed my mesh and fixed it the old fashioned way.
@bobby  hey bobby  yeah i reached out to dr. petersen in may of 2012  three months after my surgery and he wanted me to wait 6 months to see if the nerves would calm down  in which they didn t  idk about now but back then he was a no insurance surgeon and i didn t have  14 000 to pay for the two surgeries  he would ve removed the mess from one side of my groin and 6 months later take the other side out and that also would have been two stays in las vegas  hotels  car rental  etc. i knew a guy in florida that went to him and had a mess plug removed and i guess he s doing fine but as far as me  the mess has been in for way to long and there would be major complications if it was removed now. after so long of trying to find a surgeon to remove the mess bcoz 99  of them will not attempt it  i ve just accepted that it will be there until it eventually erodes thru something then i won t need to worry about it anymore. i just live with it for now brother.
@silver grizzly  yes  i paid for it out of pocket.  i was desperate and fortunate to be able to raise the money.  i still needed pain management  but have gotten out of that horrible system by using kratom  red  to manage the pain.  it s legal in my state  i get it from oasis kratom online.  praying for you brother  it s awful what they do to people.
@bobby  hey bobby  are you rob from florida
@silver grizzly  what a nightmare!!!   praying for your healing  jay!!!!!!!!!!
nope i m from the buckle of the bible belt.
@bobby  whaaaaat  that s where i am  lol. outside of charlotte. i asked if you went by rob bcoz the guy i knew was desperate for help also and raised the money to pay for his surgery with dr. petersen and rob liked cats. i noticed your profile picture and i said  huh..lol. also his mom called him bobby.
@repent  jesus is coming soon!  yes  it has been a nightmare for sure. thank you for the prayers my friend  god bless.
yep.
good advice  but i am unable to extricate myself  i ve been hoping to for years  but anytime it seems like things might just go my way  it all blows up in my face  at this point  death is the most beautiful angel in existence for me  and i await her daily.
shalom.love ya sister. happy new year.be well.great to see youblessings and love.
you agree with you .  you see the good people leave because of mandates.  i retired early because of the mandates.  i hate going to the drs and worked 25 years in healthcare.
you are in our prayers  much thanks and love go out to you..may the most high and righteous heavenly father  bless you and keep you and cause his face to shine upon you  may he strengthen you physically  spiritually  and mentally  for the battle that is coming before us.may he encamp his angels round about you and hide you in the secret place of the most high.god bless you we love ya mam.
happy and healthy new year to you
thank you sister!
right on pn!
for those that want to greatly improve their health and prevent reliance on the medical system for unnecessary drugs  i highly recommend researching the carnivore way of eating.  over the past 9 months i have gradually changed my way of eating to only animal products  meats  cheeses  eggs  etc   lost 70 lbs  have a lot more energy than i ever have before in my life  and all of the aches  pains and other issues i ve had are almost completely gone.  i also never feel hungry like i would on a calorie restriction diet and this was key for me to improve my health.for anyone interested i highly recommend watching either dr. ken berry or dr. shawn baker  both on youtube.  there are a lot of others  but these are the two that introduced me to this way of life. dr. berry has great videos that give in depth explanations while dr. baker has a podcast where he interviews other medical professionals as well as those that have made the switch to the carnivore way of eating.edit meant to add that you would be amazed how much of our health is tied to what and how we eat.
i have missed your videos  patriot nurse! be well and thank you for your work to help us.
love you sister.  praying
the standard of care in the us is largely decided by what is billable.no longer do frontline icu doctors drive standard of care  it is now bureaucratic hospital administrators and desk doctors who have never treated a patient  nih  cdc
thank you dear.  god bless you!!!!!  keep getting better!!!!!
many will be held accountable to god in the medical profession  for the death of elderly and many more!
02 20 2023 hello teacher. beautiful sweater. pearls and curls  what a girl. i can not reach where i bleed. just a fact. just like i fall to the left rear. hospoital hateds me and that is mutual good nurses have retired because of mis management. the story is the same at all of my cities hospitals and dr s offices.  every doctor s office is manned by a nurse practitioner. i like and trust these people. they still have some feelings for the patient. sincerely don
while in the er with my mother for 8  hours  i heard nurses making fun of a patient who had obvious mental issues  ignoring and eye rolling patients  yet enjoying socializing and joking with each other at the main desk.
also  there s so few doctors   seemingly everybody is a p.a. acting like they re a doctor. most of them are incompetent in that position.
how about a few classes in las vegas  nevada its 85-90  red!!!   with a red governor!  if your classes are not insanely expensive me and my wife are in. as long it s ccw friendly we re there. big fans. please think of us loyal donald fans.
love you...stay strong!!!
pn......u may or may know that  doctors who come here from other countries  not 3rd world nations  that s england  ireland  italy but the other places in the world... .4  5 and 6...thesedoctors usually cannot pass the  boards  required in the us. due to language barriers sometimes  but often due to  i never took a class on that--osis . we had a dr at a prominent hospital in the jacksonville  fla area who was from syria. he was a  cardiologist  we called at 2 am for a cardizem drip for a stubbornly elevated heart rate on a 56 yr old woman.his last words before he hung up on us were    set up for a cardioversion  i m on my way.   our patient was in sinus tach 130s-150s  we called everyone we could think of to try to stop him.house super  er docs  her main dr on her case....hospadministrator. no one would step in. 5 of us in icu talked til we were blu in the face. and refused to take part. he cardioverted her   i hit the code blue button  the girls brought the crash cart into her room we had already put it outside her door behind a curtain..... he wanted to run the code. the er docs arrived to run the code and she died anyway.....she went from st to vt in one shock and never came back.            later i talked to a brilliant pulmonologist from his country. i asked if he knew  dr assol mirdir  and dr pulmonologist said   yes i sponsored him to americahe couldn t work in usa because he failed the boards. so he works under my liscense for 2 yrs while he studies.  many foreign doctors do that.                  the very next day  he cardioverted a 42yr old cop on the telemetry floorand he had a heart attack.he didn t die but he couldn t do his chosen career any more after his cardioversion             i m sooo done. i m so sikovit.....i went to a hospital administrator..theymanaged to work me out of my position in the icu and i went to massachusetts and worked the last of my hospital icu years up there.                i went to a famous hospital in mass w a cellulitis in my left calf from a fall. that hospital couldnt just take care of the cellulitis....oh no  they absolutely insisted on changing my bp med to lisinopril from a med i d been on for 20 years. i refused to change my med they let my bp run up to229 195 so i took it. i had anaphylaxis  a traumatic nasal intubation w a  6  a 3 day coma.....and managed to escape w my life. i m soodone.....i m soooo done.
i have been a rn now for 31 yrs currently in dialysis.....i need your class god bless
this goes way back.  when i was 16  i was a candy striper  and the nurses on the mental health floors were the worst.  give them their drugs and forget about then.  i ve been scared of hospitals since  in my 60s now.  i filled out paperwork with the hospital that my sister  who feels the way i do about this  is my health advocate  which means legally she cannot be prevented from not coming in to an appointment with me.  i am her health advocate  so we cover each other s backs.
@jean blythe  my experience is not the nurses on the mental health floors being  the worst  in regards to mistreating the mentally ill  but the er nurses. i have worked in both environments. many er nurses hate taking care of the mentally ill or intoxicated patients. i usually volunteered when i was an er nurse because i felt they especially needed compassion.
i had a head cold that turned into influenza type a with 105 temp and i still couldn t get to see a dr because i had contagious symptoms.  i was sick for a month before i could get a dr office to at least do a video call with me.  needed 3 prescriptions and 2 otc meds to get through this.  this was totally unnecessary.   they were fine with sending me to work because i tested negative on the covid test.  my job has 2 policies they follow depending on if you test positive or negative with covid.  so because it wasn t covid i had to keep working spreading my illness around or risk getting attendance notices leading to loosing my job if i don t work sick.  this medical system is pathetic!!!
is there a place where nurses can work that don t follow protocols and big pharma. more holistic well rounded nursing  i live in utah. anyone know of any places like that
sorry patriot nurse  but i live in chicago and my dr at christ advocate hospital is a bed-side doctor. he s the best. he talks to me about my treatment care  doesn t demand what care and meds i will take. he s a great down to earth jewish doctor. when i need to go into the hospital  i go where my doctor  practices. when i m in the hospital  the level of care is awesome. when i call my doctor  he always takes my call and talks to me.  never had an issue with a shortage of meds. now with all this said i m sure there are nurses and doctors that are in short staffed  but i couldn t tell wit the level of care i always get. much love from chicago
this is sad! how do we fix this
i m on blood thinner  how or where do i find anything other than the pills to keep my blood thin  i ve got three artificial heart valves  so i need the blood thinner. please help me anyway you can.
it s time to get serious about your health imho  i for one  no longer have any trust left in doctors or the medical system  especially big pharma. been to the emergency room for folks i know over the last two years  and from what i have seen  the system is hanging by a thread  though that could be anecdotal..
patriot nurse you are absolutely correct. my husband and i have been to the emergency room two times after covid. we have never been treated so horrible in our lives. never saw a doctor and sat in the hallway for 5 hours to have a nurse come and see you only two times while we were there.
one solution is gathering all the non poison poke docs and nurses etc and building a system of their our  own .
i have not seen my ph doc in about 3 years. sadly we have to go soon. not looking forward to it.
the new young dr i saw was clueless as to invermectin i told if i get sick i will take ivermectin she said oh no too many side effects... i asked her for the side effects she was stunned and had no idea she was just following the narrative. i told her where to find the data on the fda website
godsovereignfree thank yous for shining so brightly    sharing truth
i got out of nursing because i refuse the mandated jab. i m aware i m just a number to whatever job i have. no one cares about my health but me
i think you re missing her point. she never said that every doctor and nurse is bad. she s talking about the growing rot in the system on the whole. things can change  and they can change very quickly. your health plan may decide to change its terms and reimbursement scheme  and it may drop your beloved physician from its list of participating providers. then you would find yourself with another doctor who does things very differently from the one you have now. as the economy continues to slow down more financial stress will be placed on the health care system  and cuts will be made everywhere. its going to affect everyone who works in health care and who accesses the system for care.
the paperwork for our local hospital now says you give them permission to do whatever they think is best for you. i draw a parenthesis around it and write only what s ok d by myself or my son and his name. they also ask you to sign docs without seeing what you re signing. i ask them to print out the docs. i was having x-rays done.
we are a fallen world and this includes the loss of love for others. there is no  fix  for this  but jesus.
please come to connecticut. we need your classes.
well said!
how do you take classes on herbs  i m an rn  don t need to learn vitals  but anything else you offer
health care has been horrible for many years just as pn described. this did not all start only since the c word
i am so happy that you are feeling better. i was concerned for a while. thank you for all the information you dispense.
i had long been familiar with how social services health care does not provide chiropractic to people who need adjustments - but only physical therapy and diagnostic tests  which do not correct spinal misalignments.  thus  people become more   more crippled.  how isn t it that having a doctor or physical therapist refer or schedule someone to a chiropractor is not ethical standard of care
@missingyou  well we all are going to die   it s just a matter of willingly allowing the enemy to take yours when it wants . we are being tested hard because of our collective lackadaisical allowance of sin to run rampant . those that are either blind to it ignorant or just don t care are the ones that god said will be eating and drinking and giving in marriage . some can t wait for more and gleefully await the next abomination .
@hardworking american
wow!!!!  how evil!
even if modern healthcare were made free  it would still be too expensive.
thank you pn
i m also an rn  just retired. how can i take your course in wholistic medicine
patriot nurse   we are   my family    i are not  as self sufficient as i d like us to be   i browsed through  your book list. which  one do you recommend  i begin with
i ve witnessed some of this firsthand in the last couple of years. i m almost 80  and my wife is early 70 s. things are getting scary.
during the recent event hospitals took advantage of the circumstances to rid themselves of medical workers who placed patient healthcare over political medicine. walking through a few hospitals i ve noticed that many of the people left prioritize submission to the  group politics. this group politics is the same across the hospitals. and the message is the same. join our politics  place it above the best interests of the patients  or we will ruin you.i quit trusting them at the beginning of this.
1  healthcare   control healthcare and you control the people2  poverty   increase the poverty level as high as possible  poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3  debt   increase the debt to an unsustainable level. that way you are able to increase taxes  and this will produce more poverty.4  gun control   remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. that way you are able to create a police state.5  welfare   take control of every aspect of their lives  food  housing  and income .6  education   take control of what people read and listen to   take control of what children learn in school.7  religion   remove the belief in the god from the government and schools.8  class warfare   divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. this will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take  tax  the wealthy with the support of the poor.saul alinsky how to create a socialist state
thank you pn for this video .
emphasis on the fact that every level of pain management having been turned upside down in the name of    the war on opioid epidemic   which has only worsened with fentynyl conveniently hitting the streets during the same period doctors were threatened to stop prescribing. coincidence  absolutely not. people having major surgeries are being denied pain meds because the dea has prescribers by the balls if they dare write a prescription for any opiate med. people are needlessly suffering at the hands of their own doctors and surgeons. if you re planning a surgery  you might want to ask about pain management protocol before they slice   dice you. they claim to be winning the war  meanwhile narcan can be purchased through a vending machine in some places  and i still have to cross state lines if i need a box of sudafed we re headed for 3rd world healthcare in short order.
you need to add   if you have pets   this also applies  as in   not all   but many of them   as in veterinarians havesold out big time..  where we live   they suck    that s being very kind.. insofar as general medicine   doc s  you are 100  correct   many american doc s it became - all about the              and   it has been for at least 40 years    hence the sadness of the 100  broken system   on all levels.i should add   this extends to all political  parasites  as well.. also  lets us not forget the  higher education  houses   these have been gone for decades as in around 1950 onward the real slid downhill began. for all practical reasons we have a massive system of lie after lie that most folks   simply refuse toeven acknowledge and  lets us not forget daily propaganda 24   7 on every level  toxic script readers  bought and paid forby corporations who produce legal drugs  and or garbage we are sold to eat. etc....hence all replete with toxic air  water  and food  legal drugs of what are far worse than any other forms of drugs.of what has created a nation of  hypochondriac s  who need a fix daily   i should add most of these are also hypocrites. then add in all the whackadoodle s    who know everything   yet   known nothing..  what you have left is            a recipe for disaster.             peace
love this lady!  unfortunately  the medical community has always attracted individuals lacking empathy and narcissism.
you look great i was so missing your videos. blessing to you.
it s called holistic  and there are hundreds of not thousands of resources for you to go at it yourself.
i ask this .not to be insulting or as a derogatory towards pn  as i have followed pn for years on yt. pn  you speak of how healthcare has gone bad  and i agree. i am in the hospital now  been here a week  and was just dx with lymphoma cancer and chf so i will die soon. but instead of the healthcare team looking for a solution and fighting cancer  etc.  they have just realized that my  payoff  has a better bottom line if i just quickly and quietly pass away. in other words  they re all about the money. and when you have that problem  you have all the rest you mentioned too so pn  here is my question  i noticed that your video is jammed packed with commercials which means you have filled every spot available to you for this upload that you re allowed at this level.  i notice that while you give lots of bad news but offer none of the good news or solutions on this video  not even a sample   only to  buy your books  or  take your class   that even comes with the proverbial  only two spots left  clich    if you want any access to even a nugget of information or knowledge  my question is . have you pn  also fallen over the years too     have you lost your empathy  have you lost you care or interest  has money become your focus as well   how does god feel about what you have done here   have we  your subscribers  become nothing more than  cash cows  to you now  again  i m not trying to annoy you  anger you  or upset you or anyone else by asking this question.  i honestly happened to notice the similarities and i guess  since i ll soon be joining god  he decided to start making use of me and i was inspired to raise this question to you. please don t hate the messenger!! i know that you do need to make some money and that your books and your training are good and worth the price and why wouldn t you also mention them here anyway  but  as i said  i m really only the messenger . and i m still a subscriber who really enjoys your videos. however  i can t ignore the big boss that matters
you are so right on this
depending on china for the components chemicals in 90  of our drug supply does not help. if they decide to use that as a weapon - you can guess the result. stock up at least 3 months in advance - if not l onger. take a few less  and stash them - or get them from mexico or canada - you will discover that the prices from the exact same manufacturer cost 1 3 to 1 4 what they cost here in the usa... wonder why
yes i ve noticed the same. thanks for sharing.
facts i went to the hospital emergency room numerous times with in the past year. i questioned every needle being stuck in my arm whether for blood work or i.v the nurses and doctor s thought i was crazy.
great video.  i love your sweater.  where did you get it
i miss your messages
bravura  special nurse  . god bless   keep you. !!!
it s the go-to place for psychopaths to hide.
@garrett  as a platform myself  i can assure you that we have the ability to decide how many commercials on a scale principle. we cannot control what commercials are shown. but we can authorize markers along the way in our video that indicate just when that commercial will be shown and then a secondary choice of how many  an  up to  value  roughly to be shown.  we have no control about how long the commercial content is.  for a monetary consideration  we can decide how much of a commercial you will be forced to see before you can  skip  it.  this is why some commercials you are forced to watch the whole thing  we get paid more for those!thank you for your kind words about my condition
@buford t. justice  sounds like you know more about the marketing aspect than i do. maybe the more commercials allowed  the greater the reach to audiences
@garrett  that is definitely possible  but remember  i m just the messenger. maybe  when i get  upstairs   the boss will enlighten me !
@buford t. justice  oh  you ll be enlightened!
you are such a lovely lady for blowing the whistle
we need to create a new system
i was one of those er nurses that were fired over the vax.  i had always gotten a religious exemption from all other vaccines but it wasn t good enough for the c-19 vax. i was fired but yah provided another hospital that stood and let use file for that religious exemption and did not question it.i also has my uncle at a local hospital and his care wasn t even subpar.  i never let anyone know i am a nurse.  so i can sir back and watch. the nurse himself only came in the room once in 8 hrs till we complained
one thing everybody should be considering is the fact that we are in the last days before the second coming of the savior.. we need to seriously considered revelations in the bible  we will not be able to buy  sell   or trade without the mark of the beast..... so her wisdom  is sound we need to be able to take care of ourselves in the coming days....
garlic is one of the top five medicinal foods in my opinion.  grow garlic.
i am 70 and a retired psychiatric rn i am n waiting for the disbursement  of drugs and medical interventions based on age those under 55 will be given priority over 56 and up
most disconcerting since i ve just turned 70. i am at a loss from reading the disclaimer about your online course  tho. it says   the information provided herein is solely for educational purposes.  nothing should be construed as medical advice for your situation.  always check with your healthcare provider before implementing changes in your health regime.  isn t that the whole idea about taking the course
i agree completely.
thanks patriot nurse... being on social security puts us in a higher risk for receiving inadequate care... whatever is cheaper except for drugs. thankfully  i don t take the usual crap and try to rely on food  exercise and supplements. thanks for sharing the truth and have a happy new year
prayers for almighty god to look after you   command his angels concerning youto guard you in all your ways.
everyone is aging out. plumbers  electricians  brick layers  carpenters are all aging out. you may have a degree but don t count on these trades. you will be on your own.
i m a long term pain patient now taking high doses of suboxone and gabapentin. any advise from anyone to get away from this stuff but still in reality manage my pain  it s from a life of heavy labor and two work accidents.
long story short -- sociopathic narcissists helpers   flying monkeys are what you are gonna see a lot of
yup. mass general and eye and ear make all patients sign that they will wear the mask and not complain or complain about care or will be removed from care and not allowed to enter the building. must sign electronicly and agree or no care
i knew that i had missed you but thought that you were ok.   i am so sorry for you rough road this year.  i had to practically fight the  doctors  in my mothers care because they would not answer my questions. found out that that they were mostly interns.  could not answer my basic questions.   after all she was in her 80 s . determined that she had experienced a heart attack and the doctor on call had spent almost no time with her and acted like she could not be expected to do better.  my questions resulted in doctor coming from another part of the building but he acted like did not know what to do because he was not her doctor of record. he could have read her chart and answered my question  .  i am very discouraged since since my care is lacking and i feel like i am a practice subject  not a valued patient.i will pray  for you patriot nurse.
you look healthy   happy
when people are given power without consequences they do become abusive and i do believe that s in the bible.
god bless you and stay safe.
modren healthcare systems ware allways like this only that covid made it much more intense
and now we face the problem that a lot of the people in the health care industry will start to die off. i say if you have a health issue that will need care  soon. try and push getting it done now  before it is to late
she has to do that to protect herself legally
thanks for some honest information.as a retired nurse of 40 years i will say you are spot on in your observations.  imperative that people learn more about making decisions regarding their health and be much less dependent on   the system .
why is healthcare an industry   currently healthcare is an unholy alliance between corporations and government  in other words fascism.
how do we find good doctors that are not connected to the corporations  i don t have much trust in doctors these days.
this is my last year with a major health insurance company.  i am going direct primary care with a cost sharing program when my policy renews.
man must not live by bread alone is now an active reality. the scriptures in duet 8.... man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god. this is my healthcare provider right now the word of god. this is not a joke and is very practical. i stand on this because in my experience my throat suddenly got achy i could feel it like my tonsils were swelling up it got so bad i could not swallow without wincing in pain. the word of god in particular psalm 118. psalm 119.. i was healed after praying and calling upon the lord joel 2. my medical supplies not only pain killers ointments etc but massive amounts of scripture that i meditate upon and live by as food water and medicine. our preparations need to be mostly on a spiritual level according to the written word. these world conditions are written. they will come to pass because jesus told us in matthew 24 daniel  revelation also speaks of the end times. we are here now! by no means am i saying roll over and be crushed never. even jesus warned that when we see these things we must run to the hills. but do not by any means run without jesus the word by which we run live and breathe. shalom gbya
thanks for your information.
i retired. was sick of being bullied and discriminated against for not lifting up my arm. i had to test weekly while the injected around me were out sick  some with side effects from their injection.
the younger health care members have blood on their hands. in a few decades that guilt will come home to roost.
happy new year patriot nurse.
the maleficence in medicine you describe is the only way i have ever experienced it  since long before covid  it has been a cesspool of pushing the newest pharmaceuticals  withholding essential treatment  verbal abuse  and a complete lack of empathy for decades. i refuse to see a doctor for any reason  despite my serious chronic health issues.  i have learned to take care of it with herbs  foods  and exercise.
i worked 20 years in manual labor from 20-40 years old. my knee and neck are shot. there s no help and i m not doing major surgery.
do you ever get the feeling that they are trying to kill us
god bless you for sharing this message.  i knew the system was broken for years. i try my best to take care of myself because the system is run more and more by narcissists. have changed my diet and many other things so i am not relying on the system.  god bless
@miki miki  i don t believe that voting is above board. there s so much corruption. you must be aware of that. peace and joy  charlotte
@freedomfighter2020  i agree mostly  but i do know many in real life that are  all in  those are the ones i speak of.
they tried to murder me after i had my baby and steal my baby..i outsmarted them and fled the hospital after a cesarean. my child would have been just another child lost in their trafficking system.
also in  dental heath field  many have left.
so true!!!  as a nurse  i tell my patients  family and friends to be their own advocates. the industry is attracting those who care more about the   than about the patients!  it s so sad to see it happening.
my daugther is an or nurse and can back up everything pn says!
wow the stories  took care of my wife s mom and my mom wife1st  they don t give water to the old ones the health care in  nursing homes the staff parties while old ppl die from dehydration!! my mom 2on  she bumped her shin in doc. office  the doc patted her leg n saidit ll be ok .it took over 6 months to heal  changing gauze everyday  oh yea they both had cases of water  sad sh t  and confirm.
awesome point about people in there early thirties being raised on screens  people in there twenties  forget it  it is literally dehumanizing anyone and everyone it can  the internet   and it s effecting a lot more than just the health care industry.
thank you. thank you very much. god bless and keep you well! joining your site.
it s so true!
dear patriot nurse  i am glad to see you doing better.
hands down the best video ive seen from you!!  30 years in healthcare myself now at the vp level  straight up facts.  i hate the industry now.
this is so true. retired rt now  thank god! some of my rt friends became travelers and were granted exemptions for the jab. some have left because of all the bs in the hospitals. my dear friend who was an rt director is leaving the field shortly to become part of a wellness clinic. the reknown cardiologist dr. peter mccullough just announced he and others are starting a type of wellness clinic. this is the new future of medicine  holistic health care  treating the whole person via multiple disciplinary healing modalities. seek out these areas all you disheartened medical personnel. there is a way forward. god bless all of you that held the line to your body and rights  loved your patients and treated them like your family.  never bow to evil. seek god in all things.
while i agree that kids that were raised with screens have issues  it s not just the screens.  many kids that got participation awards have come away with a false sense of importance and very often delusions of grandeur.  showing up and doing nothing got them awards as a kid and that s what they re expecting as adults.. but with a paycheck.i divorced the medical community after losing both parents to medical  care .when i was little  house calls still happened.  government hadn t inserted itself  into the doctors office in such a big way and insurance hadn t become a racket yet
they aren t just less emphatic but downright passive aggressive.  my blind 70 year old mother is downright scared of what they may do to her if she asks for anything
thank you  for all you do  i truly appreciate you  patriot nurse   my daughter is in med school   i wish i had the money for her to learn from you  .blessings to you in the new year.
my husband and i are both nurses  this is absolutely true. my biggest concern is that i was born with a no functioning thyroid. it s not autoimmune  my thyroid has literally never functioned properly. i m trying to build up a stash of my thyroid meds due by refilling each scrip the minute they allow it.
my mom was rushed to the hospital thinking it was a stroke  it wasn t    i told the dr what she was allergic too etc.  so picked up the pills and gave to my mom.  about 10 minutes later i thought what did i give her i didn t look i trusted guess what they gave the one i told them she can t take. another ambulance ride and another 6 hours at the hospital after she spent 2 hours puking and pooping.   real bad bad  so at 2am they finally gave her meds and an iv we spent over 11hours at the er.  it was full i live in a small area and there was over 40 people waiting at 5pm to see dr s and at 3 am when i finally got her out there was at least 11 people in the waiting room.. mostly kids.  the 2 hospitals in my area have no beds for anyone they are full up..
as long as you tell the truth with no spin .......people will follow you to hell and back  thanks for what you do and bring to the table
i am so happy to see you are healthier.  thank you for all you do.  you still remain in my prayers.
my usphs nurse manager at federal prison wheeled a prisoner that had neuro changes down the hall and said the prisoner was faking. few weeks later we sent her  prisoner  out and she died from syphillis. nurses had asked md prior to all this if an rpr would be done. dr laughed nurses off.  they later promoted nurse manager to nurse recruiter lol. system is broken.
thank you for putting this out there!
i hope there is a good one here in san diego. i went on a video conference call with a np. i was so disappointed. in the video call  she was wearing a mask! that showed me her level of indoctrination.
good morning pn thank you for your service. love your work
thanks patriot nurse for your intellect and trying to prepare and help others!always rock solid sound advice
i admire the work you are doing!  thank you for great information!
choose health  choose peace   amen   love our patriot nurse in pearls!
just heard the other day that starting in 23 the fda is regulating vet meds and the way i understood it you can not just go to a farm or pet store to get meds anymore you littetly have to get a prescription from a vet or a vet has to administer said meds.
what i really hate is that you can go to a hospital  see 3 different doctors  billed 2 grand  and leave with no prognosis diagnosis but some written drug to take  1 week later your still sick...
we agree wholeheartedly with pn s assessment of level of care in the hospital nursing homes. a family member has died this year after being in and out of hospitals and nursing homes for over 7 months after a fall. we visited each location numerous times  other than intensive care situations  our relative got zero attention that we saw personally. meals were often not what was ordered and or late  physicians  nurses  and pt staff were invisible not present even after repeated calls to the bedside. we feel that our relative died because of the lack of care received.
you are 100  spot on with this.
hi    i ve had hypothyroidism for over 30 yrs. been doing research on synthroid. it causes lots of health problems. i asked my endocrinologist the other day for armour thyroid medicine. i ve heard it works good. the doctor act like i ve lost my mind. tells me all the side affects.  and ultimately disregarded what i said. won t be going back to her again.  good luck with your journey
@karin judge  i ve been managing my own thyroid health as a nurse for over 30 years  i m 50 . very familiar with armour  but you still need a prescription for it and if they stop supplying meds to the pharmacy it is still going to be an issue.
look into ancestral supplements
bad pills   1000s  care.. ..protocol
i sent an email through your website about some thoughts i have on health.
only if we allow it by not disbanding these captured agencies   that goes for the entire alphabet.
that goes into effect june of 2023.
oh my gosh! thanks for letting us know
@ooohhitskaren 63  error on my part that was suppose to be 3 not a 4 thank you for pointing that out i ll correct
@ooohhitskaren 63  what type of meds will be included in this  antibiotics  antiparasitics  others
@w  all of them
asking a doctor for help in this day and age can get you zipped up in a body bag.
i decided not to become a nurse because i spent time working in a hospital and volunteer fire rescue and could see how bad as well as the direction the  health  care is going.  obama said  if you like you health care provider you can keep it  well god is my provider.
thank you for all that you are doing and teaching.
totally agree.btw  i love and appreciate your openness.
stay out of the system as much as you can  but don t neglect regular check-ups. exercise is the magic bullet of longevity.
pharmakeia finally receiving the judgment is deserves. healthcare is not gone  its just that you don t find the people that care about your health in the same places anymore. as any reasonable empathetic healthcare provider would do - they left the institution  not the calling  because they care and because their employer doesn t care.
agree saw this starting to happen in the late 90s i m just glad i m retired
thank you! we are experiencing what you described here  in milwaukee. a relative in healthcare confirmed the same information.
my family member was imprisoned in hospital for 36 days and because she had pneumonia but before that had the c-word and not  poison stabbed   they treated her differently   threatened rendeathisnear drug and a ventilator ultimately. the worse bedside manner ever.
so great to see you! thank you and may god bless you! you are meant for a time such as this  and we need you!your is showing here.
thanks for sharing this information  sister nurse.  i was collecting some supplies myself for emergency treatment at home and some medications.  i like herbs and roots  and even charcoal best  but am determined not to rely on healthcare as we once knew it. you know my doctor says he has not seen even one patient with covid.  some say they had it  but no covid positive folks.  something weird about that.  i will tell you that i began distrusting the hospitals when the local news were saying the hospitals were packed with covid patients  but having taken two people to the emergency rooms at two hospitals that time  there was no cars in the parking lots and no one in the emergency rooms  i got suspicious.  my neighbour  a nurse as well was not working due to not bing needed.  she finally got work at an md office and is pretty happy  as the doctor is both  intelligent and honest !   but right now  my brother in law s mother had a stroke and they said she needs hospice because there is no longer places to keep aphasic people who do not desire to eat and need a lift to get out of bed.  she is in her 90 s.  i suggested a couple places i used to know or work at  but my sister says  they are not in business and she feels like they just want old folks to go ahead and die  because they are not worth the money or effort.  she lives in washington state  where i once lived and worked.  my sister who once refused to retire because she needed good healthcare is retiring in january.  now  i will help her focus on  the freedom of focus on health  healthy activity  a stress free activities that don t focus on  enslavement mentality !  she is 65.
love this patriot!  thanks for holding strong and all the great information
my wife and i are extremely happy to have retired from nursing well before the covid nonsense.
be at peace sister.  its going to be a long rough road ahead. stay strong and know the holy spirit is in you.
also  please be prepared to care for elderly family yourself.  no matter what.  you ll do a better job than a facility.  and dying at home needs to be accepted again.  it ll happen surrounded by love and the lord that way.
looking much better.   so true todays vid. my doctor whom i credited with saving my life  stage 4 cancer  8 years ago has gone rouge  followed the covid government protocol  lost me and many others  wife and i went over a year without a family practice doctor  we ve found another but not happy with him. thirty  forty   fifty years ago my doctor was happy to see me and mine without pre appointment. now days 3 - 4 months wait for appointment considered normal.     peace in your life!   very good advice.
thank you for caring and sharing this information.  praying for you to heal and be able to bless us with your knowledge.  thank you so much for your passion for caring enough to do what you do!  god bless you sweet angel of mercy.
thanks pn  why  i would ask  would we think the medical community be any different while all of western civilization turns to sludge
so glad that you re doing much better. god is good! prayers for you  absolutely.
your beauty and passion for freedom inspires me that there are still good women out there
he s my provider  too  and he never lets me down!!!!
lawsuit started in ca already.
@kathleen pimentel  against remdesivir   i hope so!!!!
@repent  jesus is coming soon!  yes.  three big law firms.
@kathleen pimentel  excellent!!!!
they  lied about many things...
in washington state hospice is putting people to sleep. i ve seen it and had a patient who was a head of hospice in pierce county- she was honest and honestly thought it was best all the way around. true story!

thank you patriotnurse for your information. i love listening to you. your a wonderful person  i admire you very much.
thank you patriot nurse for sharing the truth regardless of how grim the situation is becoming. i ve purchased a few books on holistic treatments and natural remedies that people used to use before the rockefellers cornholed medicine with politics and money. what a timeline we re a part of anyway  you and reid are amazing! stay based and blessed!
hope everything gets better in america and england where i live   but i don t think it will happen somehow. healthy new year to you patriot nurse and everyone from nottinghamshire. xxx
absolutely correct. seen and experienced it first hand.
i hope to never need the medical system ever again but probably unlikely.
i don t.i do not trust what my doctor says. i have to research everything.thank you.
happy new year to everyone  and thank you patriot nurse
thank you for your voice. it is needed
preach it girl!!!!
studying herbal medicine so i can take care of my family
she is correct. the people who stayed in healthcare are only there for the paycheck. the days of caring are over.
just curious if you have caught some of these recent covid topic twitter spaces. one yesterday was doctors speaking uncensored on the whole ordeal.  well worth checking out. lots of great insight to the average joe and i m sure you d have much to add also.
amen!!! i agree with you 110 !!!
could you provide the titles and authors of the books you purchased   thank you so much!
thanks for this video. i have a question  will this also affect veterinary care  some of us not only do have pets  but also livestock that would need caring. will the healthcare system s overreach affect the care for livestock  thank you.
good to hear from you  wish you the best in the future.
thank you. praying for you.
agree 100  and so many of these people keep voting for team communist.  defund politician s and the welfare club.
why are people still paying for insurance   its a scam. people need to start standing up violently.
god bless.
hello there patriot nurse nice seeing you again
have you watched the documentary died suddenly
veterinary medicine is having it s own crises. there is a shortage and many practices are being bought by corporate interests. it s so sad.
what are my alternatives i recently got insurance but not good quality because i can t afford
when it comes to the supplies  this actually ties in to what alan roberts  another youtuber  has been saying to obese people  they re overloading the medical system. instead of accepting that they are obese and changing themselves for the better  fat acceptance became the norm  which lead them to banking on the medical system to sustain themselves so that they could continue on with their lifestyle. which  in turn  wrecks the entire healthcare system  especially from those who are chronically ill and need to have maintenance. all of this  is coming from our pockets  taxpayers .
my son is type1 diabetic. i worry the day will come when he can t get the medication he needs. what herbs or alternative medicine can he use
christian persecution is becoming a prophecy fulfilled. don t give up your faith.
thank you
thank you
going on for over a decade.
something wrong with team devil. they don t have the right to kill us.
this new healthcare killed my wife of 45 years last august!
you look like celine dion  but with much better skin
...just know there will be no one coming to save you...                     ...yoyo...         ...your own your own...
it is better to invest now. you will never be younger than you are today and there will never be a perfect time to invest. due to compounding  which einstein called the 8th wonder of the world  you can get rich slowly from investing if you do it from a young enough age.
@melanie linkous  alan roberts explained it in detail in numerous videos. so many  i couldn t even follow or link them. best bet is to check his channel of the same name  or search about obesity and his name on the search bar. it includes them being on medicare or such.
you are dealing with evil
thank you for your insight and understanding.  the storm is approaching    cui bono   for whose benefit    an individual needs to be asking that question.
thank you! get well!
i am on social security and have medicare and it is horrible!! i have come to the conclusion when the government runs the health care system it is not in the best interest of the people. the government wants you dead if you are not contributing back into the money pool. i m going to say this they literally killed my brother! he was a veteran  but  the va was over 100 miles from where he lived. he served in south korea  defending their borders from north korea. while over there he became infected with hep. c. years later he was extremely ill  living in new york  forced to retire early because of his disease. he was on medicaid at the time and getting ready to switch to his medicare. the state of new york took away his medicaid and told him he had to go without health insurance for 3 months before his medicare would kick in. he died 6 weeks later because they took away his medication. he was too sick to make the trip to the va. i talked to him every day the last two weeks of his life and he died a horrible painful death. our government is now in the business of killing people they do not deem worthy of living. he was one of them. i live in kansas. it happened to my friend here. she was disabled and on medicaid and ssi  she got a letter one day saying some doctor she never saw reviewed her file and said she was able to work. she was not. she had had a heart transplant and was in rejection. she lost her ssi and she died about 6 weeks later. bill gates has said we will be forming panels who will decide if it is worth spending money on people who they deem unworthy of living and those panels will decide whether or not to withhold their medications. i ve got news for you they are already doing it!! as for me i never see a doctor. i see a pa. clinics here in wichita are overrun with illegals that are being sent here. no one ever answers the phone. it s impossible to get refills without the pharmacy faxing them 4 or 5 times. the whole system is not  customer  friendly at all. and it s getting worse with every year that goes by.
some rn s have been making   10 000 per week which is great. however  it seems the newly found  riches   and tiktok dance skills  have went to some of their egos as well. more  them vs us  mentality going on. more focus on the cash than the care.
now if we can pray   get our finances in order to be able to eat better!
i thought it was just me who feels that most medical people act like robots    i m addresed as a   not a person with a name. oh dear!
so let me get this straight. a lot of people left the health care business because they were forced to take experimental drugs  i hope i have misunderstood this and this is not the case.
how can we start a parallel system that doesn t operate the way that modern medical system operates
i am so sorry for your loss.

she is correct. it s hit and miss with healthcare workers. urgent care doc kinder and knowledgeable than er doc.
is anyone else getting tired of hearing how our whole society has to worry about old people who took terrible care of their health and need advanced medical care as a result  how are they somehow my problem  you reap what you sow.
god bless you  god bless america.
these people are emotionally void of empathy.
i m on med. adv  take routine meds for cad. would love to not see my doc any more. he follows the idiots and lost his brain. would love to find another health practitioner.
this nurse agrees.
when i have to go in i feel like a pow being treated by my captors.
great video
i looked up the documentary you mentioned   generation rx . can t find it anywhere to watch- i did find it on amazon prime video but it says  unavailable to watch in your area . why    does anyone know where i can watch it
have you seen anytging about the health assurance life assurance that is going to be available soon
all these good people from the health care industry who left will be the ones who create the parallel societies.
so basically what you re saying  is that we are heading into idiocracy realized
im supposed to be taking trulicity every week but i haven t had it for weeks  its still in china.
thanks pn.   good luck in 2023.
thank you.
i am a retired canadian nurse currently in texas where my partner is receiving cancer treatments unavailable in canada. we have american health care insurance through our sons american  company for several years now. not cheap for sure.. there is no comparison to the two systems  with the us being so many times advanced to canada . yes you have issues for sure and i know as in ever where not equal through out your country. but in canada because it is government funded by taxation to citizens we get the lowest cost of every thing! think as health care in canada as no better then a third world countries and you are close. your access to doctors   specialist   imaging  treatments etc.is so far above our standard it is criminal. you do how ever have supply and drug procurement issues and if that can be remedied   then wow! you are correct in many things but know your country is still doing better then your neighbor s  north or south. god bless!
patriot nurse for president !!!
forgive the name  i am a mom. i have always wondered a deep question of mine for you  anyway. have you ever heard of v.a.t.e.rs syndrome  babies specifically in the 1980s  thank you for being a true nurse.
the good  ole days when someone with a medical degree actually cared about you ........when was that
47 years as a ortho surgeon  independent. protocals override 16 years of training. why am i needed

your stressing to much ! i can see it in your face! your correct! i know! try to relax a bit honey! i know it s bad but at least your aware!  thxs for your efforts!  deap breath! it s obvious!
good health care is becoming less and less! this is because good healthcare is being generalized and spread thin. when you take in social medical issues and generalize on them without tort reformation  and or adherence to private and even public medical practice  the common consensus for healthcare is that anyone can do this! the reality is anyone can do healthcare generally trained  but correct health assessment are left to those that are truly engaged and specialized in the professional fields of specialty! over a dozen years working with bio-med techs in my field  repairing sterilizers  defibrillators  monitors  diathermic eq  telemetry equipment  baumanometer s  centrifuges  infusion pumps  hypothermia blankets  beds  hematology lab eq  ecg s and many others. worked in house as well as the field with staff  nurses  doctors  administrators  central supply  private practice  etc... worked for amsco eng for about 3 years before leaving for another position. aes
find a naturalpathic doctor or a private membership health care dr.
with millinals and gen z generation  are the next group of doctors and what is going on with education high sch or college will be very scary in about 10-20 years. whew has education is going down hill in a hurry!

my uncle just had his second stroke today ! 3 jabs and they sent him home after 5 hours today ! in canada they want us dead they will offer free suicide before u can see a specialists!
tonight is to police force budgets as is black friday is to retail budgets. trust me  you don t want to buy what they re selling.no drink and driving please.
maybe we need to hire our own nurses  doctors  teachers  police  firemen  etc. how about politicians  we  the real people pay them...will change that a bit.
god bless

this is what idiocracy looks like folks.
every american needs to watch d!ed suddenly as soon as possible  time is short !
patients are now seeing more np s and less dr s.
is concierge care a partial answer
well it s not a surprise.  they re not recruiting in the medical field for talent anymore.  they are recruiting for  diversity .  and they don t hide it.  between that and the government medical industrial complex profit over care connection  forget getting decent or competent care.
awesome you are!
thanks!
i am interested in your classes
@patriotnurse  is it even safe to go to the er for an x-ray
don t go. use alternative medicine.
it s horrible under the regime!
merry christmas  and happy new year.
you can still get good care if you are rich.
thanks honey your brilliant

any other vacc1ne injured nurses here note a change in personality
who with a functioning brain ever thought for one second that anyone in the medical industry ever gave a shit about patient care to begin with  lol!it has always been about money  power  and personal future. providers don t care  it is simply a task  a piece of work to be processed.

why are the blood clots looking like earth worms or tape worms
here s one no one is talking about. i am an o rh negative universal blood donar. i donate every 56 days and have all through this pandemic. i started back in 1993. they blood tested all donors through 2021 for anti bodies. i tested negative a few times then negative for antibodies for four times. oddly i have never been sick or had any side effects. i did not and will not participate in a biological experiment. i saw on line the red cross was taking blood from the jabbed and that the contents were not in the blood. right .  i asked at the blood bank i go to. they said yes they were accepting blood from the jabbed. i knew right then our and worldwide the blood supply is contaminated. now a naturopath in i think sweeden has started a blood bank worldwide for unjabbed donors because unjabbed who need a surgery don t want blood from the jabbed.  the red cross and my blood bank call me a first responder and now those unjabbed are purebloods. things are really getting unbelievable. so far i have had one request from a friends husband who needed a surgery was not jabbed and didn t want contaminated blood. wow what a battle that was between the doctor and the hospital. i donated and they had to battle the rest of the way. found out later he did get my blood. beware if you find yourself in need of a transfusion because they do not designate my blood from the unvaxed.the doctor in sweeden started this because he was horrified at what he was seeing in the blood under a microscope and all the problems the jabbed were having after the jab because of the spike proteins attacking the patients hearts  ovaries  testis  brains  livers  kidneys you name it besides blood clots. a couple with a 1 month old went to the hospital for tests. they were not jabbed. the doctor said the babies hemoglobin was low so he gave it a transfusion. immediately blood clots formed and the infant died. my heart goes out to those parents and doesn t seem anyone is being held responsible. then there are the reports coming out from coroner s and the silicon type stuff they are pulling out of the arteries and veins of the deceased. they don t know what it is. and those in insurance are seeing skyrocketing claims of those disabled after the jab and sudden deaths of those who were healthy and no problems till after the jab. almighty god and father help us all. do the research it s out there and piling up but so far these devil worshipers are still getting away with all the harm they are doing and havoc they are creating. beware.
i started doing this in 2020 god will keep us
@miki miki  yes god almighty will be with his faithful children.. always.it s just our being responsible for others he wants a good attitude... efforts physically.
the whole medicial system needs to go down. dont blame people for eating poorly...at least not all the time. our food industry is harmful as well. i beleive this is all purposeful. we all are in for a reset. and i belive its going to happen. i also believe nurumberg trials are comming and lots of nurses and doctors will be held resposible. and we the people say no forgiveness will be given... education is needed and you should never rely on any medicail person without knowing yourself. unfourtunly even our municible water systems our poisoned. hopefully more people wake up and help themselves.
who says they were raised in broken homes dear
beautiful nurse
i wish that all the people writing on this comment thread would write those same comments in letters to their congressman   representatives   governors and hospital administrators.

i worked as a lpn at fort sanders knoxville years ago. even then we were told if we did not get the flu vaccine we could not work. many of us did not want the vaccine. when i refused  i was told if i refused the vaccine i would not be fired but could not clock in to work.      talk about double-speak. as a single working mother i caved. we nurses who worked short more times than not. we nurses who worked double shifts when asked. we nurses who worked as a team with the best interest of our patients. my younger friends who are in nursing also tell me its a nightmare now.
not to mention the strain on medical resources  by the inundation of foreign invaders.
i guess the days of medical professionals dancing in the halls and posting their videos is over  maybe they all started dancing or choreography careers  it was foolishness.

please can you improve your sound for those of us who are hard of hearing.
ronald reagan did warn us that socialism would be ushered in through governmental health care

best of luck! we got out of there january 2018  just in time. was looking at fl  but ended up nearby. sad part is it takes one pharma owned politician to get in there and turn fl into ca. ppl need to wake up  stop worrying about losing material things and unite against this evil before they finish off our liberty

well  if you understand hospitals are banks you would never go to a bank to get a transfusion so..  yeah... they are banks not caregivers!!! so get healthy and use beet root for bp works better than rx  eat as fresh as you can and all prepackaged food read the label fir bio engineered products and the name brands are the worse offenders!!!
i hope me putting this message on here did not upset you or make you angry with me but you are a babe

i will never trust so called health practitioners agsin
happy new
yep but i see this in uk
it is worse than i thought thanks
a waiter is not a chef  and a nurse is not a doctor  an american diploma mill doctor is not a real doctor. you will only get justice or medical care with the level of financial resources you have. everything you will experience in the former united states today is theatre  if you require anything real then you will be disappointed. when you are waiting in the exam room the doctor is consulting web md and often will repeat the exact verbiage and treatment. you will do just as well if you live near the border and can get meds off script. or you can continue to exhibit cognitive dissonance and stockholm syndrome because the reality is very uncomfortable.
sounds like the v.a.... you didn t care much when it was just us though  soooo...enjoy.
i only saw tik tok dancing nurses videos
compliments for your candor. but  this is what you get from the government health care.  stop expecting caring from government.
no one ever cared it is all about money.
you look fantastic  btw.
i can safely assume that your practice is not in california  in which case i would like to run a situation by you. as i m sure you know california just passed a law and governor newsom has signed it making it illegal for doctors to disagree with the covid narrative.from what i ve heard on your video it s not likely that doctors are going to stand up and be counted because they ll lose their livelihood  but  can a doctor sue the state of california or the governor for violating his first amendment right to speak the truth to his patients from his knowledge gained by his years of practice  even when it goes against their narrative.secondly  from the patient s point of view i m just wondering if there is legal standing for the patient to sue the state and or the governor for violating their rights to a second opinion
it allowed a invasion
depopulation
lol  i am in the military  i already have to be my own doctor.  it s ridiculous  i had a 6mm nodule on my lung  doctor wasn t worried about it.  my glucose was high in my blood work  150 s   he wasn t even going to pull my a1c.  turns out that when the nodule was 2mm  no one said anything about it  and the doctor never compared the new xray to the old one.  needless to say  i had to demand a ct scan and an a1c blood test  which was high as well  suggesting that i have type ii diabetes - which is my fault  but for christ s sake  it s diy medicine .
catholicism in healthcare needs to come back. after all  catholicism was the one who invented the hospitals and nursing. everyone who wants to go into any branch of medical field should learn about true christianity.
hi nurse ! is that you
plant your own medicine and be grateful to god not man..!! free for the planting.!

so is patriot nurse going to endorse taking dietary supplements  because i tell you the typical american diet is crap  and even if you eat organic you may be avoiding the toxic chemicals  but you are eating mineral deficient food. you see plants pull minerals from the soil  plants don t require the majority of these minerals  but we do. and every year the soil has less and less of these minerals unless minerals are put back into the soil. farmers care about yield not nutrition. so we must either grow some of our own food  or we must supplement... unless we are stupid.
