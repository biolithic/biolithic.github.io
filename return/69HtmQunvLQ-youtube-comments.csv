you re right. criticism should be directed to voice casting and director. saying that  i don t know if she listened to her predecessors and got what they brought to the role. she can t make any changes. that s the company. and  no  you couldn t play ada wong  but i do like listening to you. may god continue to bless you and keep you safe.
