God bless you melonie. that Bible verse and interpretation hit home.

thanks melonie for the awesome video and beautiful Bible verse shared. always enjoy hearing your testimony!

I love that Bible segment in this video - its a huge comfort to know that  when one path you pursue doesnt work out  it may often be that the path youre on right now  or are being led towards  is better. sure  it calls for discernment and wisdom  but you nailed it when you said that we ll look back in ten twenty years from now and think to ourselves  Im glad that door was closed at the time . keep going boom with your Bible segments. you rock!

I pray for you every day meloniemac. jeremiah 29 11. I love that youre not afraid to share Jesus with everyone. I always look forward to your videos.

hI I just subscribed to your channel. Im a gamer and youtuber. Im a Christian as well. as a tmnt fan I think this iteration of april o neill is horrendous. why take away the femininity and beauty april had in the previous comics

melonie mac  you are a God send in the gaming community. thank you for all you do.

verse of the day was on point for me. thanks melonie! exactly what I needed to hear.
