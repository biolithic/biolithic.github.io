dang  don t often see someone with the guts to drop a bible verse. thanks for the video.

alright that s a really good bible verse for this. you made very good points here. and i m looking forward to your chaotic hufflepuff play through stream.

always a good day when mel breaks out the bible and hits some home truths!

go  team hufflepuff!!!!! and a bible verse at the end! love it!

i just want to tell you that you shared a wonderful and great bible verse for today melonie.

i love that you read from the bible

love your spiritual approach on these polarized ideas. there s not a more loving yet stern pov than a jesus based one.  5 appeal in my book

this game should be a banger and i m getting excited for it. it s so awesome having a fellow christian who loves gaming talking about these things. great video as always and i hope you re doing well.

you nailed it  melonie. never bend the knee to the enemy or his children. always demonstrate through the way you live the hope that is in jesus.
