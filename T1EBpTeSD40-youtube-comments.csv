my favorite thing about the marvel movies  is that after  end game   i became completely detached from the need to see what happens next.
i m gonna be completely honest  i keep forgetting this movie is supposed to be a thing. and if i m going to be even more honest  i am sick of woke people calling us bigots just because we don t like the lack of quality in these filmsand if i am totally honest  i find you way more entertaining than any of the marvels  shows films  melaniehave an amazing day  and god bless you all
brie larson  i m not a diva. also brie larson  i refuse to work with this actress.
can t wait to hear brie say the movie isn t for men  or  if you don t like it don t watch it . inevitably followed by blaming the movie going bust on us doing exactly that.
i can understand her being angry about not being the center of her own movie.  i imagine that when she was contracted  it was implied  if not outright stated that she would be the lead of x number of movies.  i would be angry too.  but her behavior has been absolutely atrocious  even before this current mess.  she is just a hideous excuse for a human being.
my favorite interview of hers is when it was her and jeremy renner.  the body language from jeremy speaks volumes.
i like pepper potts and black widow how they were introduced and how they developed in iron man1 2 and avengers captain america winter soldier ultron. they had a good thing going with the female characters  why change
imagine being mad while also being a millionaire movie star who was given such a lucky shot. anyone would be grateful just to have a major role like that in the mcu
reminder  the marvels is set to come out on november 10 one week after dune 2  and one week before the hunger games spin-off prequel  the latter might have some serious demographic overlap w  the marvels too .
this can t be much of a surprise to anyone involved in the production  given how she behaved in interviews and whatnot around captain marvel and then avengers. the real  problem  is that they didn t build the schedule to accomodate her ego and demands  which they had to know were going to be a thing.of course  they brought all of this on themselves by further catering to larson  so i m not too broken up about it.
the thing is with tony stark s arrogance and self-confidence is that he is still principled  he still stands for and fights for things. he s still friendly  he s still caring and he still gets emotionally invested and even sometimes doubtful of his own abilities when the things he cares about are on the line. with captain marvel  she s always snarky  arrogant and self-confident  but there s nothing you can point to that she actually genuinely cares about. she barely shows an emotional investment in specific people  and let s not talk about that deleted biker scene  or alludes to anything that she would hate to lose.to highlight the problem here  let s say thanos wanted to emotionally break tony stark  and he snapped his fingers to make tony watch the people he cared about disappear. who would tony lose  he d watch pepper and his daughter disappear  he d see peter parker disappear and he d see cap disappear  as well as the other avengers.if thanos did the same to captain marvel  who would disappear  nick fury  maybe  i doubt it  but him and talos i guess are the closest things she has to friends.let s run it the other way. when tony stark died  he was surrounded by the people who cared about who sat with him and said goodbye as he died  assuring him that they d be ok and he could die without being scared for what would happen to them. he d spent the last 10 years having visions and nightmares about thanos and his army killing his friends and family because of his inability to stop them  and now that thanos is dead thanks to him  he can see them all alive and safe as he dies. what a scene. sorry  i m getting distracted.if captain marvel were to die  who would be with her  she doesn t care about anybody  she wouldn t die for anybody in particular  there s nobody that she d feel relieved to see safe as she dies.
but this is also my issue with a lot of the mcu films altogether. too many of them are just ensemble movies and they don t really focus on one lead. it feels like everybody is kind of leading and they re all stepping on the wrong toeswhere i miss the earlier marvel movies were at least the lead was the lead and the support cast was entertaining
ironically  elevating women of color would have made monica rambeau cm before she ever was... just like in the comics.
glad to see a brand spanking new video from you  melonie! i hope you re having a stellar day
she was mad when her own movie sequel had to be shared.
brie larson  still can t stop i love it when she s mad it makes me happy
disney just needs to remember who their target audience is for superhero movies and cater to them instead of the twitterati
i felt they had a big miss when the rumors first started and it was ronda rousey as marvel. people wanted to see that  but when they announced brie larson  interest in the movie tanked. that said  i would put money on their current issues as being a direct result  so they needed to find a way to backseat brie and recoup some costs.
the captain marvel stuff has been going on for years. when they announced  the marvels  as the follow up to captain marvel.. no one believed me when i said it was done like this because of the negative views on her. she was supposed to be a huge part of the mcu... but one of the few smart things marvel has done the past few years is limit her because of how she is.
the only thing i was partially looking forward to was monica rambeu because i liked her in wandavision.
mean you gave up just as much as i did once end game was over you figured they should have took a  long break. would anybody be mad or the loyal fans who stick with them for that period no. but the executive s at disney would be and that s why we ve got mostly trash right now from marvel.
@christopher loyd  eggsactly
not really something that a series should want anyone to think  but it s the truth.i remember waiting in anticipation to see these movies.  now the only time i think of them is when content creators i like talk about them.
the mcu ended at end game
get this   i checked out after infinity war.  i assumed endgame would have the good guys winning  and everything would be just fine  and i didn t have to care how they did it.  i still haven t watched it.
i m with you because the mcu has become quantity over quality.
@anthony duffy  yep  it was in the title lol.
man  what a great series finale. i m so glad that the franchise ended right there and that everything else are just pet projects and fanfiction.
it was literally a funeral for the mcu. only spider-man came out unscathed.gotg2 was mid   elevated by infinity war and thor4 brought them back down but it won t be long till they kill off the gotg in 3.
for me it ended after wandavision.
at this point it s more of a badge of honor to get labeled as one of those words nowdays
yep  the yutubers are more fun than the hollywood people
yeah what was this about again
@shaman sage  agreed
i just keep forgetting about marvel altogether. i ve been in that  superhero burnout  mode since the first iron man   avengers. i ve seen a couple  but i m just beyond non-enthusiastic about anything superhero any more. the boys was ok  and if it was another time i probably would have really loved it. i m just tired of superheros over and over and over.
nia da costa is very pro black and since monica rambeau was the first female captain marvel in the comics and is cannon as she said on the tedd lasso interview with brett goldstein multiple times... she nia dacosta used her opportunity as the director of captain marvel 2 to strip captain marvel off the the title of the movie and just call it the marvels... instead of calling it  captain marvel 2 the marvels  the one thing nia dacosta seems to forget is that wasp from ant man was the first avenger in the comics and the first leader of the avengers...yet evangeline lilly  has never complained that she should have rightly been the leader of the avengers instead of iron man and captain america rightfully so....and that this is cannon...cannon as nia da costa seems to be obsessed with....put some respect on carol danvers. and monica shouldn t be sharing a title. how about giving her a solo movie!
yea im thinking this movie will expose the entire world as sexist
make entertainment great again
@j  i love it
haha guess disney didn t understand what the word  end  means
where is galactus  where is knull!
the scripts are just bad
its because kids and teens slowly become adults and smarter and finally realize superhero movies as a genre are the same story recycled over and over again.
@light up arguably thats any series or movie franchise that focuses on the same characters and concepts.like james bond to fast and furious to tomb raider.
i m only interested in seeing what happens to peter.
@bryce federwitz just how many villains showed up in ant-man 3 and who else was it besides kang and m.o.d.o.k.
marvel died in 2018  they sealed their fate with iron man gonelet s make entertainment great again
i have no issue with  feminizing  characters or turning the movie into revolving around a younger female character  just so long as its done well!  granted  i still think the male version should have a place  but as ive brought up before  in re to captain marvel  it s interesting  though not the least bit surprising  that they introduced the character as the later female version  not the original male version.  dc had to take the reins on that with shazam  and frankly  it was a much more enjoyable movie.  i didnt dislike captain marvel  but brie isnt exactly the best actress  that  along with other factors  dragged that movie down quite a bit.  too bad  it couldve been a lot better!
same.
brie larson   i am not a diva. also brie   i will be the next me  thank you very much! i refuse to work with these actresses. why am i not the title character  why was the title of the movie changed  is this a personal attack
seriously they need to release a bree larson katherine heigl buddy comedy...the movie will be shit  but the behind the scenes drama would be legendary
when you listen to some of nia da costa s candyman interviews and even her captain marvel 2 interviews..she is very pro-black ..and didn t like candyman killing mainly blacks in the original candyman movie..so she course corrected this in her new candyman movie....monica rambeau was originally captain marvel and the 2nd leader of the avengers after wasp  even though most foirget that it was wasp not monica rambeau who was the first avenger and first leader too..nia da costa mentioned this a few times in interviews...i believe that it was nias da costa and teyonah parris that changed the title to the marvels...not the mcu or kevin feige....in phase1 2  3 the mcu controlled everything..but since phase 4 they ve given all powers to the directors.......
nah. she s not the star. she ain t pissed at fans anymore. she s pissed at marvel or disney i should sayher ego only lets her get that upset at the performance of something she is the unequivocal star in.i m sure she could give two shits how this movie does  in fact probably hope it bombs so she can talk down to disney like she did the fans in the past in which her inevitable conclusion will be that the movie bombed cause she s no longer the sole star
the title change from captain marvel 2 the marvel to just the marvels was 100  nia da costa s idea not the mcu or kevin feige or marvel or disney.....it was all nia dacosta ..and since phase 4 kevin feige has given full power to the directors of the movies unlike phase 1 to 3 where he withheld the full control from the directors
same  but i find it hilarious.
haha yeah he was trying too contain himself. he clearly wanted too tell her too shut up
chris  hemsworth was mocking her straight up to her face in one interview i saw.  she s remarkably unlikable
i m gonna quote the critical drinker here..-   it s because of the message
i agree  black widow was awesome  even her ending was good and full of meaning  you can feel the drama  too bad her solo movie came after end game and in the mid of pandemic. even if the quality was poor  the story about her life was a welcome thing.
unfortunately she s not that deserving of the role and treats everyone she thinks is below her  which no one is  because the rest of the cast and crew are important  worse than dirt.

thank you for putting this into words  it really helps me remember what makes carol so...unmemorable and shallow as a character.
@alpha stoutland  worry not  good sir  and thank you. i will always vocalize the myriad problems with this  character
i still don t like tony either  but i see your point.
well said
@seven
in a sense  they kind of foreshadowed larson s attitude completely by accident in wandavision. monica gets all touchy when carol is mentioned  implying they ve fell out.
@danny palin  wait  did they replace the actress  is that supposed to be her pilot friend from the first movie i struggle to believe they even stayed in contact  let alone fell out. and that s really not something you can just imply in someone else s show in a throwaway line scene  that kind of development has to be shown
@t00nyboy  monica is her best friend s daughter. though  to be fair  captain marvel sucked so you d be forgiven for mistaking the two. also  bingo. you hit the nail on the head. it s been established that carol s best friend not only set up s.w.o.r.d  earth s defence against intergalactic threats  but died of cancer between infinity war and endgame. monica died in the snap. she also fell out with carol. all this was established in a project that has nothing to do with captain marvel. it completely takes away her connections.
@danny palin  really  out of all the side characters to set up a btec s.h.i.e.l.d   why wouldn t nick fury do it  or agent hill    they make carol s best friend do it  she s in the entire franchise for like a couple of scenes in one movie and she was a pilot for the air force. at least peggy carter was already part of the strategic scientific reserve and would have helped restructure it into s.h.i.e.l.d  as well as having an obvious reason for wanting to do so.
i mean he s not  like hostile but to me tony has been the least friendly and least easy to talk to of all avengers in mcu and otherwise.
before it was too many villains. now it s too many heroes.
yuuuup!
i still want them to bring the real captain  mar-vell
yeah  i mentioned that in multiple comment sections  if they really wanted inclusion and diversity  they had rambeau as captain marvel  the one i grew up with .
would have been a better film if they did her story instead but no.
thank you so much
you should have said a  marvelous  day. lol
@okami ravensong missed opportunity
you must spend your entire life happy!
@matt p   yes i guess so
twittera-whati
so kids
@chandller burse  so you re one of those  eh
@xmvario  marvel movies are targeted at kids tho
@chandller burse  pretty sure its mass audience  wich yes  includes kids. but a general kids movie does not make nearly 3 billion like endgame did.
@xmvario  yeah well nerdy adults count as kids too sometimes
@xmvario  you mean like how any pixar movie can gross billions
@brian aguilar  name one pixar movie that made nearly 3 billion  i ll wait.
@xmvario  incredibles 2toy story 3 and 4finding dory
@brian aguilar  none of those made 3billion  let alone 2 billion
ronda would ve 100  been a better pick. she actually looks like she could put the beatdown on some people  same as gina carano.
great character in the comics too  but underused
you can always count on melonie to get to the meat of the situation these days
actually  i think all the rumours about the marvels come from the fact that disney know it s going to be a disaster and are pre-emptively scapegoating brie larsen. whatever she may have done  she is not the producer  the director  or one of the writers. it s not the actors that turn movies into turkeys  though they often get the blame.
i know i m not looking forward to it. hey melonie. hope you re well
i ve been wanting to see your take on this whole crazy brie larson situation.  honestly  i don t really care too much about the marvels  and i m inclined to believe these rumors about brie being a total diva.
feige  brie  i d like you to meet your co-stars larson  is that like a personal attack or something
melonie is back stronger than every. love to see it.  winning
i never knew a plank of wood could be so angry but brie is proving me wrong
i was looking forward to marvels  but then i woke up from my nightmare. i m fine now
i like how the poster goes by character popularity and put monica on top.
happy thursday melonie mac!
it ll be funny if everyone just forgets the marvels when it is released.
good point -- isn t the movie going from being about captain marvel to the marvels more inclusive for everyone
i tuned out of marvel after end game. i m still mad that they didn t give me my black widow movie before they killed her off. i ve never liked brie. she always came off as a rude person. i never even watched captain marvel because i don t like her as an actress.
i ve been waiting for it to come out  purely to see the dumpster fire unfold
@8 55 lmao i love that we got a classic lara croft reference in there   bringbackclassiclaracroftit s so true  anything geared towards a  modern audience  a female character must have some kind of chip on her shoulder. even angelina jolie described classic lara as someone who does not hate men or is in competition with them. i think that was part of classic lara s special formula and why people loved the angelina movie so much. and then we had the reboot movie and that flopped in comparison so what does that tell you..
melonie great content. keep it up. you re killing it.
imagine working for disney and knowing you put all these woke projects into production and now know their is no profitable audience to support it. yet  so much money already spent and you have to let it play out. what a mess and i can only imagine they are panicking for going all in on woke. also  captain marvel only did good because of when it s release was.
love watching this channel and probably has a lot to do with the person that makes the content is extremely and i can t express how extremely i m saying the word extremely when i say she is extremely easy on the eyes. she s a knockout she s also very smart witty and funny so she s like the perfect combination of awesomeness and that is a very enjoyable thing also i agree with a whole host of things that she has said in the past therefore i love this channel and i think she does wonderful work it also helps that she is very easy on the eyes. so yes i will always subscribe and give a thumbs up. keep up the great work love you you are awesome
i am looking forward to moon knight season 2 if it happens  or possibly a moon knight movie if that ever happens.
at this point  if you know you have a weak product  you might be better off to just make it as pc as possible. if it bombs  you can always blame it on intolerance and most critics will like it no matter how bad it is.
was a pun on carnivore  didn t mean anything sexual
meat of a bs hate story  for clicks
hey! wood is useful and can be curvy and very pretty.
they say plank of wood can t hit back  but this plank of wood can hit back.
@   paine  certainly can t throw it back though.
release the kracken!
maybe if they do a sequel it can have more than 5 minutes of moon knight
melonie it was a blast having you on mario kart a couple of weeks ago with g g. please return back again to mario kart with g g  rippa  lady rippa and dan vasc.
i unusually find myself siding a bit with larson in this case because she signed up to marvel with the intention of starring in her own title.  ojectively speaking  not only does she have a point  but her first movie did gross over a billion dollars and that fact should be treated with respect.  on the other hand  brie has to understand that today s disney only believes in diversity ensembles.  so no one gets a title to themself anymore without being flanked by third-rate actors who are only there to fill out a quota.  not thor  not dr. strange  not hawkeye   or ant man.  she is just mad because as a woman  she is being treated the same as the male stars in those other movies.  i will shed no tears here.
great video melonie  as usual!had to go see what brie won an oscar for.  not surprised that it was for a movie that i had never heard of that came out in the last ten years.  imagine my lack of surprise.  brie s an adult pretender who shows the acting range and public charm of a plastic spork  useful in a limited way  but quickly disposed of.  which is a sucky position for a human being to be in  but it seems to be what she was working to be  so i guess yay for her success   it s not her fault that her character was written as a one dimensional grrl power deus ex machina device  she is the one who can overcome any enemy easily just by the power of being female.  it is her fault that she put one dimension of acting ability on display with this character and one dimension of humanity into her publicity.  it s disney so it won t happen  but this is hemorrhaging money it ll never make back  so better to just shut it down now and release it as is and hope that enough fools watch it to get rid of some of the red ink before they shunt it off to d  as filler viewing.
that s why she was so perfect as envy adams. she s stayed true to that persona.
pff  she was probably born mad
still gotta keep supporting u sis i am so grateful to u for keeping me inspired to stay in church and stay in the gym always looking forward to ur next video go boom  ur haters only keep ur sub count growing u look amazing btw   god bless u  stay hydrated stay strapped and stay safe
0 07 i m actually super excited to watch the film!  its going to be total cough but the reactionary content   vids on yt will be fun to watch  too   real talk  the only thing i could look forward to is iman vellani s return as kamala khan. sure  her d  show was dog-turd  but she pulled off the young  colorful fun-loving ultra-fangirl character really well in a charming  wholesome   likeable way  both off-screen   on
she s not just mad . she s brie-mad!!!!
truly groundbreaking news.  i never would of known that a spoiled actress is acting spoiled again.  i dont know where i would be with out youtubemz.
sometimes things don t go your way in life.  it happens to all of us.  frustration is normal  but at some point she needs to put on her big girl pants and move on.  it s not healthy to keep holding on to things you can t control.edit  yes  i realize i m expecting someone in hollywood to be a grownup
her o s story she s born amazingshe ends up amazing.the story is just about how everyone realizes how amazing she is by the end of the movie.
yay  another video going boom   hope your having a fantastic day  melonie.
i m looking forward to john wick 4 and dune   part 2 way more . hey melonie! hope you are well !
here s the biggest irony about all this drama behind closed doors. the plot of the marvels was leaked on a marvel studios spoilers reddit page. this page has been either restricted or taken down so everything posted on it is true. carol reveals that she s only seen as a hero to earth  the skrulls and the avengers and their associates. the rest of the universe refers to her as the annihilator due to her actions whilst helping the kree. kamala has a  never meet your hero  moment where she botches a strategy and carol shouts at her. when she goes off all upset  carol is told off by monica  saying that   kamala  is a kid  not a soldier . captain marvel portrayed danvers as perfect. everyone was licking her bum and her only conflict was that she d lost her memory and had forgotten how amazing she was. the marvels portrays her as flawed. when you think about it  it makes perfect sense  she s sharing the spotlight with pocs.
i do want the marvels to be released.  honestly.i won t see it  but i really look forward to reading all the yt comments.
remember back when we were excited about the next marvel movie   those were the days.
amazing. brie larson should be glad she even has a job in the first place  given her lack of acting ability and poor movie performance in the box office. this news is worth the price of a movie ticket alone  i ve got a huge grin!
i m looking forward to the marvels  of course. there s a lot of content to enjoy based on that disaster that will provide me with hours of entertainment while i m working xd
well  not every film can be as amazing as  unicorn store
it s amazing how she s allowing it to go to her head  especially when i didn t even hear anything about the movie  so it must have not been that. if there is one thing that really don t like about famous people it s arrogance  and that goes for irl also. but i don t think i m going to be watching anymore marvel movie  atleast in a long time.
room is actually a good movie though.
@brian aguilar  it does sound like an interesting concept  and apparently it was well done too  so no hate at all for that.
i d like to see her get better writing and effects.
you left off the part where she has to overcome the patriarchy that is holding her back by finally believing in herself
glad you  came to a marvel  bs conversation  to express  your  non marvel desires.
@alvy hernandez  if you paid attention to the video you d know she said to comment the exciting movies coming out soon.
eat hate bro. eat well
you crack me up . keeping it real on youtube. love it.
some people just can t handle being an oscar winner . they let it go to their heads!
i was actually excited for this
8 55 -- gotta love it. hope it never becomes  work  for you to talk about it that you get sick of it. if we are entering an age of a.i. and technology  one  thing they can t fake its this kind of enthusiasm for a subject
is anyone actually looking forward to anything from hollywood or disney
i m definitely not looking forward to the marvel s and bri larson is annoying as an actress! but i m glad you re talking about this and doing well today. you look great too!
i liked the captain america movie mainly  because  of the retro look of it   i especially  liked the bad guys car   better than any batmobile i ve.seen  i also loved cruella de villes  glenn  close   car  too   maybe there s something wrong me   sorry i m old .
can t wait for this blockbuster release of a film to release oh wait never mind barely anyone knows it exists
i will forever say that katee sackhoff should have played captain marvel.and disney is proving me right.
elevate women of colour... except in my films.  - brie larson
imagine if the iron man sequel was called the irons
it s always the people who shouldn t be cocky who usually are  it s sad to watch
my mind screaming  please don t release it! please don t release it! just scrap it! reality  they probably will release it
i love seeing the wheels turning in brie s head  as she was promised  near enough four years ago now  probably 5 years since production casting  that she was basically going to be the next big hero of marvel and the central pillar character going forwards... and here we are a half decade later and she isn t even the lead character in the sequel to her movie. how the mighty have fallen  etc.
i cracked up when she a vid a few years ago about how she was not fighting bots on fortnite when she could barely survive and build a wall. so bree is full of it.
all i can say is that i m looking forward to watching joker 2
this all makes sense. elevate voices  so long as they re not as loud or louder then mine.
i never saw captain marvel. but i recall someone saying it would have been something had the character been played by katee sackhoff or ronda rousey. or even gina carano before disney decided she is a horrible person.
brie is like any other actor that goes to the extreme.  they spend so much time in the role they are onscreen but then has that public persona which is another role.  that creates a weird remaining section where its them being confused about how much of their real selves they show.  brie is stuck between her extremely limited view of what she thinks are problems in the world mixing into her public persona.
wow being the first woman ever to star in an action movie wasn t enough for her
keeping  it real when reading a bs article.
no.  at this point one must wait a week for real reviews to see if a movie is worth the time.
thank you so much  andrew
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
@melonie mac go boom  melonie  i am not looking for forward to see this movie. brie larson have some anger issues.
christian bale says hollywood  and the world  would be better if  white dudes  weren t in charge of everything the actor says there would be  so much better films and so much more interesting stories  if white dudes weren t running hollywood. zack sharf dec 19  2017
christian bale has had enough of  white guys  running everything in hollywood and beyond. the actor stopped by aol build with his  hostiles  co-star rosamund pike and wes studi on december 18 and told the crowd that the reason he moved to the u.s. in the first place was because he wanted his kids to grow up in a  country of inclusion.  unfortunately  that ideal hasn t been too much of a reality.
our culture will be so much richer the day that we stop saying   hey  it s all white dudes who are running things    christian bale said.  whether that be hollywood  whether that be washington  you know. we re going to get  in hollywood  so much better films and so much more interesting stories being told and america will become the america that the rest of the world sees it as  that makes it unique that we recognize makes this such a beautiful  brilliant country.
melissa mccarthy would have been better.
she is great in the mandalorian!
captain marvel is a broken character  overpowers the situation. i never cared for the character itself.
@mr sunshine  carol danvers was fine as ms. marvel. her motivation for being captain marvel was the clout she had in house of m. this is a friggin  villain motive.
@j4yz  i mean  she s playing the same character she has voiced since 2010.
that was jennifer lawrence not brie larson. get it right! jennifer lawrence was the first woman to woman!
i agree with eric july and others that katie sackhoff should have been cast as captain marvel. she has more of the physical action background. she looks so much like what captain marvel should look like.im glad she s in the mandalore though.love you mel girl
if this is true  it makes me wonder what s brie s story..  never heard anyone complain during captain america civil war where chris shared the film with big start  some even bigger or even with his status and that movie was enjoyed by a lot of people... why the drama
brie   i wanted diverse characters to be elevated but i did not mean in my movie! lol
bree inspired me to proudly identify as a  non-pronounal ista-phobe!
i always keep forgetting about this movie.  even before its release it s that forgettable.
i really do want to see it and truly enjoyed the first one for the most part. but honestly  i keep forgetting that this movie is even a thing
just watched morbius. might be the best marvel movie to date!
brie larson is mad  must be a day that ends with  y
i know one guy who says he s  hyped  and  excited  for the marvels. if they made a movie about a sentient bag of dog doo and called it  marvel s doo bag  he d be there opening night.
namor and his peeps had to save the last wakanda movie  bring him back soon!
i saw a catfish last night on meetme using melonie s pictures as their own. of course i reported them. i did think it was flattering though that they put their age as 26. just goes to show how youthful melonie looks  those are some great genetics!
capt. marvel lost me completely after they subverted fury s scar. also the horrible villian showdown.
i forgot this movie was even happening.
just wanted to say keep up the great work not really looking forward to the marvels at all really only looking forward to one more movie in this phase so far and it s guardians 3 but even i m a little iffy on that to be honest
she asked the girl that played ms. marvel   am i an avenger
the director has little experience and they brought in new writers in january. given that and the quality issues in recent mcu products its likely larson - an oscar winner  a producer  and a director - is seeing the problems in the production and has legitimate complaints.
just because people don t like a film it doesn t mean someone is misogynistic or right wing. the real problem when this happens is the accuser projecting their insecurities onto another person. they can call me whatever they like  i ll just tell them politely to jog on   do one
do you remember that news about brie larson having a  stunt double  just for her behind. it couldn t just be called a body double because the double had to do stunts.
i notice you mention laura croft a lot as a female that was written well. you also could use the example of ellen ripley or sarah connor. also the marvels is going to be an absolute disaster and they know it. i really would like it to make less and ant man.
how do you feel now after realizing the rumor is not true
right  i honestly thought she was 20-22
normally i find almost no issues with films the first time i watch them  but that nick fury cat scratch man  i was not on board
crash into theaters  seems to be an appropriate phrase as in leave a big smoking crater.
pretty sure rdj is an oscar winner also and he would treat his cast members to dinner and with respect.
captain marvel   it s a __ show! dbz  you need to be at  18 to stand a chance!death battle  not gonna  happen!
she is definitely one of the worst types of bully and needs a character arc and not to avoid her problems with her behavior.
meanwhile  the only thing on my mind is whether we re getting a donkey kong country spin-off from the super mario bros movie.
the marvels  sounds like a bad 80s sitcom...i lol ed at 0 10  you talking all calm and collected  me doing other things and suddenly you scared the crap out of me loloh  i cannot wait for  the marvels   i hope they bring roseanne barr back and thanos saying  bazinga   a classic...
also you should stream more on twitch!!!  please halo or resident evil stuff if you have already played everything you wanted to beat.
she has an oscar! ! !
some say the most dangerous drinking game in the world is the  melonie mentions lara croft game.  if you play it you ll be dead in an hour
it just isn t worth the time or money to watch  nothing against monica rambeau  even kamala kahn  though neither are my favorite characters  i liked their overall demeanor and they are simply dragged down by their stories and kamala could be interesting  if she was not a captain marvel fangirl.
has anyone ever put two and two together on this before  maybe the reason captain marvel 2 title was changed to the marvels has to do with how captain marvel was likely propped up at the box office  people suspect that the numbers for ticket sales and gro   were augmented by people who were buying tickets to give away to little girls. rumors had people reporting a lot of empty seats in theaters opening weekend. maybe these rumors do have some teeth. if this is the case  they know brie larson as carol danvers captain marvel is not capable of carrying the movie. captain marvel  did she get demoted to 1st lieutenant marvel  or is she now private marvel when will marvel realize most people don t want male heroes emasculated by female super heroes
brie should smile more
she embodied the current rendition of carol danvers...which didn t sell well.
the only interests i have in the marvels are the great reviews of the train wreck that it is.
it can also be that these rumors are just created to keep this movie in public view  otherwise people will just ignore it. i am only suspicious if the media completely to one person. if there are just rumors you never know if these are are real or just intended to shift the public view of this boring movie. so as we don t have really complete info i will not judge in any direction. even there is some  fighting  inside normally this is not only one-sided
having a diverse multi-ethnic and multi sexuality having characters and cast it s like having shield around your show or movie that protects it from criticism. there are a lot of movies where the focus is on gender or homosexuality or racial issues or americans terrible racial history that are very good and it s also the point of those movies. i think we re current hollywood especially disney is dropping the ball is that they seem to think that when somebody goes to watch something like the teenage mutant ninja turtles they want to see the characters changed and they want to see them have sexuality even though it s a kids show and they want who at all the people out there who complain about the lack of diversity in shows or in the oscars and the like. the thing is nobody who truly enjoys these properties cares about those issues. they care more about what they re watching. i am half black. i ve been a pop-culture junkie my whole life. i ve loved movies and television and music of all eras and except for blatantly racist things like the sound of the south i have never once cared about the sexuality or race of the characters that i m watching. characters created and designed to be gay i ve never questioned it or cared. that s what the creator of that ip wanted. the one you take a character that was never gay and it s been around for fifty years and then all of a sudden make them gay that kind of bugs me. and have nothing to do with the homosexuality aspect of it but it has everything to do with the fact that even though the showrunner trying to say the sexuality isn t important that is the most talked-about aspect of the new show. like the velma showrunners you try to say that the race and sexuality of the characters isn t the important thing but that s all the shows about. it is a shell of the ip that it s based on. but even if the show wasn t based on scooby-doo and it was completely original creation with all the same characters that has just no connection to the scooby-doo universe  it would still be a heavy-handed and awkward show that nobody would like but at least it wouldn t have that extra bit of hate because it tried to be scooby-doo as well. mindy kaling could have made an original show about teenagers and their gender and race issues and could have actually made a decent show that discuss these topics but instead it decided to make it scooby-doo and it takes a dump all over all those topics as it tries to act like it s an important show. but as far as i can tell ethnic people such as myself and homosexual people and gender-diverse people aren t into the show anymore than anybody else is. the 80s had a lot of silly tv shows and movies  but if you go back and look at any tv show from the 80s they re all about being entertaining somewhat fun. now even in our comedies that we make recently everything is so serious.
the only superhero stories i am looking forward to are  the boys  and  invincible .     a mystery men reboot.   long live the shoveler!the last superhero movie i actually wanted to see was logan.
i look forward for  the marvels  like i looked forward to my last breakup.
i like captain marvel and have watched it a couple of times. the  greatest  superhero suits her character - both have too much attitude  but that is fine. the movie had heart  and good actors apart from her. i think it should be titled cm2 and they need to use her  rather then push her aside. go brie!
crash  into theaters.interesting choice of words....
as much as i didn t finish the series  i did find kamala kahn to be much more interesting as a person than captain marvel  mostly because she was actually shown to take an interest in saving people. she didn t have full control over her powers and she almost failed to save someone because she fucked up the usage of one of her powers  and it made her panic when she thought she was about to let someone die.
damn  man. i m sorry to hear that
in this case i ll wait for the book to come out. wait nobody ever says that. remember to drink water. everyone have a wonderful day.
stunning and brave
don t worry. she can always fall back on her youtube carrier
black pill moment apparantly from 4 days ago in redmond podcaster ended by stalker make sure you are properly protected  fyi i believe colion noir said that in the case of self defense even if you are prevented from owning a firearm  is still lawful use of it
i love it when melanie goes boom
i know she s an oscar winner and everything but let s face it  saying you won an oscar now is like saying you got a free toy in your happy meal. seriously i loved her after kong  skull island. thought she was great in that  but something happened to her after cpt marvel. i think maybe she got too into the character she thinks she really is her now
i absolutely am looking forward to the marvels  just so i can watch you take the piss out of it
the marvel s will end up being an episode of critical drinkers production hell.
if you re going to make a video every time brie gets mad  you re going to have no free time.
melonie  who has actually been looking forward to the marvels everyone in the comments
john rocha is next level woke
it took all those male leads a long time to build the characters up  even in hulks case there were other movies with different actors to build the character up. my issue with captain marvel is she came in and tried to steal the show  even from other women like pepper potts who totally deserved her avengers assemble moment in end game. im also surprised no one calls it out that the scene of her in end game destroying the ship mirrors a star wars movie with another girl power character no one liked. i got no issue with woke  i got issue with b story lines and bad acting...
it is her default mode.
i m pretty sure thequatering is looking forward to the new marvels movie.. the last one paid for his luxury garden shed!!
the quartering has entered the chat
her original movie is probably the first mcu movie that i really despised.  admittedly a part of that was a particular bias i have  as when i hear the name  capt. marvel  i usually think of the guy from dc comics and fawcett comics before that  i just can t call her capt. marvel .  i actually did watch it because i wanted to write a review of it  and yeah it was definitely not my favorite experience.  this and endgame are what took the shine of the mcu out of my eyes  i was just done.when i hear  marvels  i usually think of that 90s miniseries by kurt busiek and alex ross  that was an amazing series  one alex ross worked on before the legendary kingdom come miniseries over at dc.  it also inspired the astro city series that kurt busiek would write  originally for homage comics which was an imprint of wildstorm and image comics at the time.  marvels  the comic cook series from the 90s  is one i absolutely recommend  it was really cool  the fact that they borrowed the name for this lame girl power movie is definitely aggravating!!!
i don t know why disney makes it too hard for them  they can just cancel the movies
brie is in fast and furious x i believe
you know i was initially excited about cm2!  i actually liked brie long ago in the us of tara.  she played a quirky teen that sat on cupcakes online and was just ridiculous. felt she would fit marvel humor  circa phase 3  and thought her first movie was ok and had potential .  her scenes in endgame were epic but very brief.. shoehorned in and clear she wasn t meshing with cast at first.  seems things quickly shifted to her woke advocacy vs just making a great sequel and involving character in crossovers.  just drama then this mpower shit.  i feel bad for brie as seems disney just used her and screwed her .  sure she s difficult but still a person that got lead on then sidelined and scapegoated.they should just recast and would really respect brie if she walks away and sues
sure i d like to see the marvels. captain marvel  mary marvel  captain marvel jr  uncle dudley  and tawky tawny.  i miss those guys.
the quartering sucks
the king
bringing her up again of coursebut shimada death vs captain marvel. captain marvel would get trolled the entire time until shimada death gets bored and kills her with a single touch as shimada death is literally the space grim reaper.
i stoped caring for marvel movies a while ago. the only new one s i watched recently was the spiderman movie and black panther two  the later i was dragged to by my sister .
your right she ain t cap or iron man she s captain marvel  movie industry don t read comics at least the good ones
you know maybe it s called the marvels because it s an ensemble of 3 heroes where 2 of them has had 1 movie or 1 season dedicated to them making this a sequel to both of them as well as a debut for the 3rd one. also thor was the only hero in all 4 thor movies except hulk in ragnarok who has always gotten the short end in the mcu. iron man had his side kick war machine who is as big of a stand alone hero as robin in batman. he also had black widow in the 2nd movie  but she was more just a fighter who helps iron man. the only 2 cases where you could argue someone got the spotlight despite having other heroes were the 2nd and 3rd captain america movies  but they story wise much more heavily focused on captain america and the continuation of the trilogy. like in captain marvel she is the focus of the story while what i assume to be the case if they write a competent story the marvels will focus on all 3 equally.
brie larson   we need to elevate women of color.... just not in my movie.
it s not that people were afraid to criticize captain marvel at the time. it was almost like you weren t allowed to criticize the film. rotten tomatoes changed the standards of the audience score because of captain marvel.
awesome video  melonie mac    go boom!ps who else would you cast as captain marvel
re  lara croft  it may have been before your time  and i couldn t find it anywhere  but cartoon network used to have a commercial of lara croft playing with a controller plugged into a television grunting and jumping around dramatically while apparently having her @   handed to her royally. in frustration she takes out her guns and blasts the tv set and it pans around to show us that she was playing pong! your girl sure hates to lose  melanie!
hey melonie so i was kicked from your server apparently but all i did was ask for help with a psn card because my brother and i aren t cleared to work due to mental reasons. it was only gonna be a one time request. we re relying on government money but it s only enough to get food on our table and the bills paid. i pray i will be able to come back. like hours after the situation i checked discord and was no longer in the server and the friends i gained from the server unadded me. currently i m overwhelmed with confusion and sorrow as to why i was kicked . if there was a rule against asking for money i didn t know and i genuinely apologize for doing it. if anyone from the server sees this i hope there is a chance i can come back to the server.
i suspect brie s been mad since the day she was born  probably for being named after a cheese.
it s a marvel that brie larson still gets work. if she was a cashier  i d never go down her check out lane knowing what kind of person she is.
i hope disney release it soon. i hope they spend five hundred million dollars on advertising. i hope they say it s the greatest movie of all time. and in the end  they get the worst financial chin check in cinematic history.
if she s being a  diva  like henry i can understand but it s not the case. lol
i think this is a big  old fu to brie without question. now i m waiting for the release of  rogue  where they will really eff her twice over with a one word title.
that movie gonna bomb and she will be even madder  d
i hate how the character was shoe horned into a movie before end game just to claim she was original avenger. she shouldn t have been introduced until afterwards since this next phase revolves around the secret wars story line.
i love your videos melonie!!
captain marvel is what created the hiding the ratio meme when know today...rotten tomatoes changed their review system for it and youtube followed...disney actually bought tickets to reserve theatres to prevent it from bombing
let s face it  who is looking forward to the marvels...   not me! i have no interest left in anything marvel is announcing these days. but then again that also goes for disney and netflix and any other entertainment company who s sprouting more propaganda than actual interesting content. but it doesn t bother me! more time for gaming  anime and going to the gym!
her movies aren t that interesting anyways  not much of a loss lol. amazing video  i hope you re still doing well.
we know today
mark my words they re going to cancel the movie. they re going to go through all this and then it s going to super bomb might as well can it and eat the loss and hope guardians 3 makes up for it financially. that s the best move anyway.
tbh  the only version of carol danvers i want to see brie larson in  is the one where rogue steals her powers.
i dunno... who is gonna watch cynthia rothrock in undefeatable or michelle yeoh in crouching tiger  hidden dragon with me instead
jeez  this article holds nothing back. i kinda like the ruthless prose here.
even brie larson didn t show up for the scott pilgrim vs. the world 10th anniversary reunion back in 2020!!!
carol has the arrogance of tony stark and the personality of terminator when it first came to past in terminator 2.
i quite enjoyed captain marvel. not exited for the sequel though. the mcu is on life support at this point.
man crushing universe has bigger issues than diva larson
why do i feel that having your ego get in the way of having a coherent behind the scenes production is something that if a man did  brie larson would have an issue with
why am i picturing brie yelling  screaming  and throwing herself on the ground to kick her feet like some insufferable  spoiled child that didn t get their way  for some reason  i can t help but picture brie larson doing just that.
everyone just sit back and relax the highly likeable brie larson will be amazing in this just as she always is plus i can t wait to watch this film it ll be well written it ll all snap together perfectly it won t make any male characters imbecilic and i know all men and women will have a smile on our faces walking out the cinema.we believe in you brie the world would be lost without captain marvel but the real brie is even more important.i need her too tell me what films aren t for me and what ones i m racist and homophobic for not really having an interest in bless her she really is a superhero.
so she has become wesley snipes during blade iii
the only reason captain craple did well financially was because people were heavily anticipating end game. i haven t heard anyone praise it.
i want to see melonie s kitty. ... i mean the cat.  the cat!  i m a cat guy.
if you cast a person for an super hero  they need to fit the role  they need to live the life of that hero to think they are the hero themselves..just look at ryan reynolds as deadpool. he is that hero now  he did it so good that no one will ever make that role again in a 100 years. brie just died like a cheese left on a plate over night.she s just that bad as an actor and as a human being.
the only way you will ever get me to a see a marvel production is of the following 1. a faithful adaptation of the sgt. fury and the howling commandos  the prime marvel universe 2. a faithful adaptation of silver sable and the wild pack.3. a faithful adaptation of the 1960s nick fury  agent of shield  the prime marvel universe
say what you will. the poster looks cool.
the crazy thing is captain marvel the character is not bad at all  it s the actress. this may be the first marvel movie that i m either going to bootleg or skip entirely.
i m excited to watch youtube videos roasting this movie once it releases. it will be a spectacle.
i was very late to that movie  i saw it for the first time a couple of years ago because i saw th3birdman s cinemasins response on it and thought it looked hilarious.sometimes  looks are not deceiving.
i m glad for people who did like the captain marvel movie.  not putting the black widow movie there  didn t have the impact her death should ve.  i didn t like how they made captain marvel first avenger  then she showed up last.
brie just expects every actress to kiss her ass  abuse she is the most amazing actress to ever walk.
melonie said lora croft now everybody drink.
the marvels was not made for you  brie!thank you very much!  p
but it s  not focused on her !!!
the mcu really needs to introduce the character of rogue  from the x-men  to remove carol danvers from the mcu and give us the version of rogue we fans want to see.
she may not be a good person but i support her. it s funny how marvel turned their back on brie larson and didn t give her a sequel while we have trilogies of heroes like iron man  captain america  thor  guardians of the galaxy  and man  and doctor strange...  her film  is not even called captain marvel 2.
it s like she s had zero media relations training. winning the oscar might be what ruined her  tbh.
i m kinda happy that dizzy hooked it s wagon to ms. brie larson. they deserve her.
you cannot unsee that marvels poster
hey  melonie i just wanted to tell you that you are looking beautiful and lovely with your black tank top shirt and your curly brown hair too. anyway i just want to say that and i just want to say that i m not looking forward to it again of hearing about brie larson getting mad again and again and again and again with marvel studios company. also brie larson needs to get her head out of her butt and stop being mad every single time she has a problem with the roles that marvel studios have her to play in the marvel movies. anyway if brie larson wants to keep her job with marvel company and wants to keep making movies for marvel studios then she needs to stop being mad every single time and start acting like a young adult woman and keep her mouth shut and stop being mad and stay with her job and stop being mad at the company that she is working for for her job career. anyway i just want to make a comment about this video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day yesterday  wednesday  and hope you had a great evening too last nite and hope you have a great blessed lovely day today at home and have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
just introduce the x-men already  and have rogue steal all her powers  as she should  and throw brie out.
great melonie mac go boom the marvel s movie delay
the more i keep hearing about this the more and more obvious it becomes that brie larson is just upset that she s not gonna be the center of attention for the movie. she was butthurt when her character only got 10 minutes of screen time in endgame and wasn t the one who would one shot thanos. all the more reason why i think she s just become an entitled brat and why everyone was justified in trashing on captain marvel when it came out and all her other movies after that.
maybe they should just reboot ms. marvel like do all these other heroes..but this time try to make it closer to her original character origins..just a thought and a new actress too. 13 10
larson needs to hop into a nissan and just drive off into the sunset... or the edge of the world.
have you seen brie larson in an interview  or worse still her in a group being interviewed  you can see the contempt and animosity  you can see the friction and sense they re all stepping on eggs...it s painful to watch her in anything  i stopped with avengers infinity war because of the insinuation of her in the next one... i ve stayed away from all marvel since  it s like an addiction you have to stop cold turkey otherwise the infection kills you before you can be weened off it...whoever thought attacking the audience was wise needs firing. what did they think would happen  they d change their minds  no! you push even more people away...
spider-man is carrying the m-she-u at this point.
straight to disney plus will at least let them avoid the embarrassment of the box office. because i think we all know  the marvels will be the lowest performing mcu movie in history
well thor was called thor even though it wasnt about thor at all  so name is not that important anymore.
i believe brie doesn t have a stunt double. because she doesn t actually do anything. cgi does everything for her.
you are hilarious and a breath of fresh air.please support a brie larson  amber heard team up with meghan markle handling pr  haha.
don t forget about hogwarts!! we re waiting lol
our culture will be so much richer the day that we stop saying   hey  it s all white dudes who are running things    christian bale said.  whether that be hollywood  whether that be washington  you know. we re going to get  in hollywood  so much better films and so much more interesting stories being told and america will become the america that the rest of the world sees it as  that makes it unique that we recognize makes this such a beautiful  brilliant country.
the other characters have been pushed to the background.  brie doesn t like it when it happened to her.
there s no need for a new blade film.  we already have good blade films.  there are far better things for ali to do  such as return in alita 2 and 3.  as for the marvels  i m waiting for it to crash  and burn  in the theaters.
that s the thing  if they actually created authentic  likeable  amazing characters for the marvels  roster  then people would actually be looking forward to these movies. the best they could give us was  a stuck up blondie who thinks she s the queen of marvel  a cute yet not that memorable teenage girl  and whats-her-name rambeau. like  why should we even care for these characters  the avengers  game did a way better job with kamala  so even if i find her mcu counter part cute and slightly likeable  it s not enough for me to spend money on a movie i ll be able to watch on streaming on the internet. remember why we were so hyped for the avengers  yup  we loved and cared about all the characters in that movie. honestly at this point i m just happy that spider-man nwh was the only light in this darkness that is the phase 4  in terms of movies  because moon knight and loki were so cool! . don t ruin spider-man too  please.
melanie   i m sorry for your loss...how much was the movie ticket
play with knives get cut.     play with fire get burned    lay down with vipers    better have a snake bite kit handy.marvel f d up badly choosing reee larson.    let them suffer.     i m not even hate watching this fiasco.
i know i am in the  few  here  but i actually loved captain marvel. having said that  i don t have the comics to refer to. i never read the comic. i do think that brie needs to settle down on this crap. it definitely comes across as tacky.
omg brie still upset that she isn t the strongest avengers.yes melony still watching the whole thing. caught your deal about the total number of movies  there has to be one someone doesn t like  thus no ism  ist status even remotely applies. people need to be comfortable with giving criticism again.sincerly yours the guy who is infact watching the video to the end regardless of what you think .
i ve checked out of the mcu dceu not fthankyou
brie may be a wokey actress of virtue signaling  but she has every right to be pissed about being written out of her own franchise. she is a good actress  and there was no acting that would have changed how boring her character has been written so far.also  this rumor saying that she s the reason for the delay can only be like half true at most. why  because this movie has been filmed ... marvel likely saw that it s testing poorly and wants to re-shoot it and cut it up to hell after ant-man. just like how they were re-shooting mom up to the last min. the movie is done  i can very well see them trying to frankenstein it into something else after the rude awakening that the mcu is headed towards a wall and i couls see brie being like  yo  i got other stuff to work on. i made this whole fake yt persona for you and you demote me in my own series and write me outta the title ... and now you want more re-shoots  ffs!
the only way i m gonna care about captain marvel is when if ever they bring rouge in to drain her dry then   only then will i give a damn.
let s be honest capt marvel isn t the popular character she marvel thinks it is or wants it to be and the actress isn t enough of a well liked person to pull people into the theatre
if they would have done their homework before casting they would have seen that this character s comic has rarely done well on its own and has often found success in a team format..but brie is just not a likable person.she is far to full of herself and her personality has the likeness of a card board box with a constant undertone of haughtiness.also to even consider that this character is the most powerful in the mcu is crazy. she absorbed energy from an engine  that used power from 1 infinty stone...not even the whole stone itself.....and to think she was holding her own with thanos   who had 6 stones in total  woke  garbage.thank goodness disney has fired one of the main people who pushed this blasphemous woke crap into families living rooms and trying to indoctrinate children s impressionable minds. thank you for holding to your faith melonie while still making quality content  keep it up! you have very beautiful hair...i bet it would love to be let down every so often. take care and god bless
crickets chirping
melonie is the type of person if someone close to her was sadly saed she would automatically blame it on the woman.
on track to crash into theatres.  that s quite an appropriate description.
to be fair  if this is a movie that nobody wants  it s weird to be put in this situation as brie larson  everything considered. and if the movie demotes her after portraying her being overpowered  so that lesser and underdeveloped characters can keep up  also could be a shitty position to be in. i would also hate it. this is what happened to other characters like the witcher.i hated the way brie played the role and acted in interviews but this is a case of two wrongs not making a right.either 1  forget about ctp marvel and remove her from any other movies - because she is overpowered and it sucks to add limitations just to correct this mistake2  own the decision and make cpt marvel 2 and - hear me out  i know this is a crazy idea in this day and age - make her likeable  let us care for her  make her struggle  we love heroes that overcome their limitations  give her an arc  crazy  i know    use the idea of the  struggle of the heart against itself   give her a worthy opponent  make us understand her power how she can be stopped - this way making her smart also  not just a brute force op boss in a game with no soul. i know it s not a great idea but maybe she could have been pulled to another universe by the events of dr strange 2  or spiderman  and her powers work differently  or she has to face an opponent that uses some other power for which she is not a good match. stop making her the villain in her own movie without even realising because all writers are morons and follow an agenda!!!in the end  i still think brie can be redeemed  she is beautiful and i remember her being nice and good at acting.
if i m a racist or sexist or any kind of bigot according to disney i ll accept the label  because we all know that they are wrong.  they label criticism of their movies by anyone this way so you might as well just expect them to toss these labels out like candy.
it keeps getting delayed because u dont rush perfection
christian bale has had enough of  white guys  running everything in hollywood and beyond. the actor stopped by aol build with his  hostiles  co-star rosamund pike and wes studi on december 18 and told the crowd that the reason he moved to the u.s. in the first place was because he wanted his kids to grow up in a  country of inclusion.  unfortunately  that ideal hasn t been too much of a reality.
she s always been this way. remember when she tried to break the internet and nobody gave a damn  she s wonderfully narcissistic in the worst  most entertaining way
the only storyline left to explore with captain marvel is rogue taking her powers. nobody cares about captain marvel. the character was lucky to have a movie at all with all the times her comic has been canceled let alone two.
i just wanna say that while i have zero respect for larson and agree with pretty much everything you said  be careful not to fall into the same trap the woke mob does by assuming her refusal to work with parris has anything to do with race. that would be no different than them accusing us of not liking a film because we re racist misogynist whatever. larson can still take her  elevate women of color  stance while simultaneously being insufferable to work with. they re not mutually exclusive
you don t like she-hulk  you re a sexist. ...i can play this game.  you don t like war on the prairie  you re a sexist!
i have no desire to see marvels. i can see her point about not having a number 2. but saying that   i didn t really think the first was that good. she was another mary sue. super genius  best warrior etc.  larson is a diva and i don t  have any faith in the mcu . have great night   melonie. as always  you look great. may god continue to bless you
dang it  brie.
when is brie larson not mad and angry and whining about everything   she s almost enough to make people side with thanos!   her movie wasn t super super horrible  but it was pretty boring and obvious filler for the real mcu movies in phase 3.
i didn t even think about the captain marvel movie in 2019  because disney altered the main character.  in animation  comics  and motion picture characters  identity is very important  because what makes the character unique   these traits are copyrights  and they need to be unique.  anyway  who cares   it is a stupid fantasy.  we live in a season of many movies available to the american public  and we have been conditioned to be entertained as an expectation  and this is wrong.  we need to pick and choose our entertainment with much better discretion  because they are all distractions and useless to us.  when was the last time a superhero helped you in real life   if your answer is not a  never   you are pranking us.  there are too many narratives that conflict with each other  and what we want is quality.
i never even like the first captain marvel i m still kind of confused we re getting the marvels at all to be honest
the oscars are nothing more than a pat on the back for the most woke amongst them  no wonder nobody watches it anymore... brie larson getting an oscar was an insult to all those that proceeded her and earned it. she got it because she was an outspoken woman not because she can act... it was  like most oscars now  a political statement not a reward for exceptional professionalism... and that s why the oscars are dying now too.
diva mode activated.
the thing i hate about the captain marvel character is the same thing i hate about the superman character.  they re way too over powered. you always know they re going to destroy their enemies with ease. there s no danger  or serious doubt that they ll win.  that makes a story less interesting.
without the discriminatory labels threatening an honest review  everyone would be able to admit captain marvel was awful. for that matter  they could also admit black panther was a lackluster  meh  movie.
maybe it was a personal attack or something
captain marvel is not a hero  she could be compared to lobo from the dc universe. just like lobo she s a thug who uses her power for her own advantage and thinks it s heroic.my first introduction to captain marvel was reading a comic book where she went by warbird and was suffering from alcohol addiction. she attacked tony stark thinking it would provoke iron man to defend him  in this comic he hadn t  revealed his identity   she bombarded his house in a drunken rage. iron man showed up and lured her away but she blasted iron man through the wing of a passenger airplane causing it to fall.together iron man and warbird saved the plane to the applause of the passengers.the comic ended with iron man explaining what she did and her passing out after denying her actions.
no shame in having a stunt double  see burt reynolds deliverance and waterfalls.
personally  i think that kind of character can be done well but they have to be handled with care. it s like they have to be aspirational and try to inspire people around them to be better which is where the conflict can come from.
@paul simeon cupido  yes  possibly.  although i can t recall anything noteworthy about captain marvel.
in brie larson s defense  captain marvel was an asshole in the comics so she played the most comic accurate character in the entire mcu.
i don t think anyone is actually hyped for this movie...i used to be a marvel fanboy but i came to realize that endgame ended the cinematic universe. marvel is done it has been real  great memories and all but right now everything is so disappointing  it pains me to say that these movies just suck  they ruined everything. dr strange is a joke  so is thor  the new caracters are better at everything for no reason  there s no challenge  nothing is serious everything is a joke. victories don t have any impact whatsoever  i saw dr strange ii and i was fuming  i m not watching anymore marvel movies  the franchise is dead to me.
the only appeal this film had for me was the nova was supposed to make his debut. he s been removed from new promo material and with the  reshoots   is he even in it anymore
i know we don t like brie larson and i m not saying you should but marvel is probably regretting that their chosen queen is the whitest girl left in hollywood. they are probably trying to get rid of her like all the other white people. the enemy of my enemy is free entertainment but in this  why are people siding against brie when we know modern marvel as a company is a complete mess  when this story itself is possibly just them trying to get rid of her. brie is a person  marvel is disney and this company hates cis white people. she s most likely a legit victim in this. i hate to say it  but disney has proven to be disgusting  brie is just a person that took a job and acted out a character.
they better not do what they we re planning for blade there is no need for a daughter make a good movie about him i guess it s a good thing i like the old comics and can still read them
i was arrested for trespassing at the abiding love lutheran church melonie.  what would jesus say about that i wonder.  isn t it strange don t you think  they actually asked me to leave the church  i wasn t allowed to pray there   they called the police and i was arrested.  florida  leave it to the people and state of florida to make absolutely no sense.
brie wants to be the flag ship character.
ah shit here we go again... - cj or carl johnson
i actually liked the captain marvel move it was 10 10  but i wasn t going to watch the she hulk one for two reason  didn t like the other hulk movies  and didn t really care to see another one no matter he her was the hulk. also i didn t know that brie larson was such a bit...diva hahaha... anyway it kind of changed the way i saw her. at the beginning when i saw her in the movie she felt like a older sister  a very nice person  but that change very fast after this crap.
see  it s daddy issues
a movie about a character that no one cares about  starring an actress that no one likes. what could go wrong
i m torn with how to mock this movie  between calling it meh-vels and blah-vels.
seriously surprised captain marvel is still even relevant after all the backlash but ig that just shows how marvel has tanked. they killed off or sidelined all their good characters and now all they re left with are the mary sues they re so proud of. i guess they yelled her name to the empty room so much the echo came back and they thought it was cheering.
the marvels are coming out this weekend. the real captain marvel aka shazam. brie larson is this years amber heard.
just call it  the brie movie  maybe she ll like it.
i want to know how bad it can be... originally
i hope the movie doesn t come out honestly after endgame and no way home i m just burnt out on super hero movies unless it something like the batman
leave it to ego to be a superhero s undoing.
the only good thing that came after endgame is spiderman no way home.
the first captain marvel should ve been a show instead
my favorite captain marvel scene was when thannos btfo d her in endgame
i forgot about the marvels...
would rather watch live leak on shuffle than another marvel movie.
who is bree larson s publicist  katherine haigl.
yah just keep shaming us  we ll just keep spending our money on important stuff or great movies like topgun maverick
i don t even know what the movie is it s the first time i ve heard about it
as long as brie larson is in the marvels movie  i really have no intentions of going to see the movie.
check out the dark rainbow stuff i  shared the 5 point pentagram the chakra pyramid elements the aura s the dark rainbows and satan  and seeing and hearing evil and selling the soul and witches its all connected
avengers is when marvel had there peak....
crash into theaters...
i liked the captain marvel movie.the first one.in 1941.almost 50 years before brie larson was born...a simpler time.
just put it on d plus and call it a dud  i mean day  call it a day.
youtube finally did it to me. they unsubbed me from this channel  and another one that i ve been able to find out so far .hey  youtube
the marvels are gonna crash in theaters
is that like a personal attack or something
people were kinda tricked into watching captain marvel because of fomo  if the mcu didn t dot important plot points for later films like it does barely anyone would have gone to see it
brie larson  elevate women of color....unless it takes my spotlight
there no saving the marvels  feel like ant man could have been saved if they revewed more
...laura croft in star wars...
she meant elevate women of color in everything except what she s involved in
i thought the marvels was a show. hard to believe this is going to be a film. i ve been waiting for the movies to come to d  but this will probably be the first one i skip entirely.
i played her once and was reported for hacking cause i destroyed her in 30 seconds. funny thing is i m on ps4 and i m not good at gaming.
i liked captain marvel even though they broke from the actual story  she needed to be a stronger character and less cute though  but at this point i give up on comic book movies.
captain marvel was a cash grab by disney and everybody felt they have to see it before endgame so they could be caught up with the mcu. i remember after i saw i didn t like it because she got her movie before black widow and other reasons
she was the issue as soon as she came to marvel. nissan is not paying marvel money.
i think they should follow the example of wb and just cancel the movie entirely. they can t afford taking the brand damage over and over again.
they should just cancel it at this point.
are you still safe and ok in relation ro that other thing  i live many thousands of miles away but i still feel like a big brother and worry!
i think had marvel casted charlie theron as captain marvel instead of bri larson in the first place they would not have had this problem. im sorry charlie fit the original description and she has the acting chops to carry the title but no give it to larson who had non of the it.
it s disneys fault. they created brea with their lies. they told the winter soldier he was going to be captain america and they gave that to falcon.
brie larson can just touch my camera through the fence at this point  right mommies
actually thought the first captain marvel movie was pretty good . i feel like it gets too much hate  . like  there s worse super hero movies lol  .
she was miscast from the beginning. larson is not on the same level of gadot or even johansson.
well didn t she say that her movies aren t for men  so imma be respectful and honor her wishes and not watch anything she s involved in.
only watching guardians 3 and wolverine and deadpool. and honestly not coming back until the x-men live action show up.
i would honestly rather have a movie about just monica rambeau instead of all this ensemble cast crap. the actress is also better than larson and the kid.
oh wow  perfect description.  arrogant as iron man  but with none of the charm. yes. spot-on summary of why nobody likes her portrayal.
briekillsmarveluniverse and actually i m becoming a fan of brie no seriously   thanos nope   kang nope   brie is the villan of all villans  d
when isn t larson upset at something
hey. thor likes her. lmao
in another reality if brie larson was a popular actress she would have been a nice pair with ikaris is the eternals movie if such movie was faithul adaptation of the comics of earth 616
who is asking for more brie larson films
crash into theatres. crash is a good word to use. crash and burn.
man  brie larson from short term 12 and 21 jump street. what happened
the marvels lost their marbles.
brie  elevate women of color as long as i keep top billing.
soft chees is a supporting actress
i know i m excited to not watch it
imagine diva with no personality. it s like a sassy robot.
never been this early
maybe it wasn tmade for her.
i could tell that marvel was about to die after infinity war came out because infinity war was way too good and it was already setting up the infinity sagas end. marvel should ve ended with endgame instead of beating the dead horse
for what did she get an oscar for  i haven t seen i good movie with her in it
brie larson  being a diva  and a hypocrite ! say it ain t so!
kwasade for the algorithm.
the only thing i ve watched from disney marvel  since endgame  was spider-man.  i don t see any reason to see this one.
the marvel s lol
not interested  but do love a good dumpster fire .mmmm marshmallows
brie larson is a awful person  i still remember that interview where she was trying to pretend to be nice and she touched don cheadles and he recoiled like the devil touched him.
captain karen.
they can just put one of those life size cardboard cutouts of captain marvel in all their captain marvel scenes and get better acting than having brie larson back.   lmao.  you re welcome disney marvel saved you some money.
brie has damaged capt marvel s brand so in order for marvel disney to sell this character they have to change the title.  honestly the just need to replace her and the writers to make a go product. its going to bomb as phase 5 will continue the phase 4 trend.  they need to cancel some films to make higher quality
the word family adventure makes it less appealing by that word alone
i been looking forward to the marvel s looking forward for it to flop.  got ya
marvel needs to learn to stop making movies that they think they re supposed to make  and make movies that paying customers want to see. or...they can collapse because in the immortal words of eric cartman  hippies don t have money.
i can t wait not to see the marvels
ain t watch that
i m looking forward to the marvels...to crash   burn.
have you seen the lara croft fortnite skin
bro i fell asleep on at least 10 minutes of captain marvel  black panther 2 was mid  and the marvels nobody is checking for it
too much power for ironman to kill himself. same with wanda
i stopped caring about marvel when the releases became woke.
commenting to feed the algorithm
marvil does not exists after end game.
i m a hard out after gotg 3. nothing else makes me care about marvel
a woke movie starring the most disagreeable   actress  in the universe is not greatly expected   no wonder  !
i stopped watching marvel movies for a while now. i d rather watch dragon ball super at this time lol
disney   mcu started insulting the fans that made them  brie larson is totally unlikeable and just doesn t fit the role. hopefully when they start bleeding they start listening to the fans  focus on good story telling  focus on entertainment without pushing any agenda. movies shows are not supposed to be political just focus on pure entertainment..
hm... in every video from you i ask myself what this thing on the left is that s leaning on the wall drives me nuts  even if i m sure it s something super simple and i have a brain blockage there...
captain forehead 2
nope nope and hell no lol all i liked in her fiest movie was that cat alien and samuel l jackson lol
i stopped giving a crap about marvel once end game came out. i only watched love and thunder because i got it free on a flight.
i marvel at the marvels because it was originally just a marvel
hopefully brie will quit and they can correct the mistake by hiring katheryn winnick like they should have in the first place!
how could this movie possibly be any good
tbh she s barely tolerable in 30 second nissan commercials.
we need to elevate women of color just not above me
can disney just go back to theme parks  and princess movies  becuase  they just keep ruining franchises. yes  some of it isnt that bad  but you cant put out a fire  with just a few drops in a bucket.
they got a self-centered  actress  to play a self-centered  hero
ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead  nor print or tattoo any marks upon you  i am the lord.
i ve been waiting for the marvels...to get destroyed and clowned on by you tubers.
stopped caring about mcu after end game.
i can t wait to not watch this movie.
i m probably preaching to the choir - but anything marvel doesn t bring interest and expectation anymore - just disappointment and sadness.
great video melanie the marvels movie can burn in hell
this movie is gona crash so bad  . lol.  we need to elevate the voice of women of color    but not in my movie. lol again. wokeness has reached its peak. now they will start to autodestruct.
the mcu really failed it s female superheroes and now i m scared storm from the x men may suffer the same fate.
people only watch because  avengers end game!the marvel go between the two avengers...
no one cares she s mad. no one cares. she got like 9 fans
beyond over the woke mcu shit... and all the other sci-fi shit that been taken over by the fema-verse..   i m going back to reading asimov and arthur c. clark .
i have no reason to watch this
well  i m not going to see that movie anyway  the same goes for antman 3  indy 5 and el muerto .thank you marvel disney  keep making more crappy movies  that way i ll save my money.
algorithm
hi double big mac w  cheese.
marvel marvel comics is done. it s over. disney rang it s death knell years ago. marvel is gone forever and i don t think it will come back. i haven t walked into a comic store in years because of it.
prediction   this flick will flop much harder than ant-man s quantumania did.   marvel destroyed itself and its glory days are long over.
maybe she s pissed bc if it s not named captain marvel 2 she maybe don t get as much money as expected... still won t watch this bs  mcu died with endgame
pandering to feminism woke politics is why the captain marvel movie sucked. her big challenge is she s  too emotional    she straight up robbed a guy for being cocky. and she never seemed genuine  relatable or humble. basically no redeeming qualities to justify her flaws or make her interesting
mcu has been dead since after endgame lol. only fan favorites they produced was wandavision and loki.  shows . doctor strange 2 was just  decent  spiderman  no way home was only good when the old spidermen showed up
i didn t know who brie larson was before the captain marvel movie  but i could tell i didn t like her because she exudes arrogance and seems to have a bad attitude in general. it s like the oscar she got for room went straight to her head.  if you watch interviews with her and cast members from endgame  it s so obvious none of them can stand her lol.
nope
still not going to watch it.  wouldn t go if i had a free ticket and popcorn.
she-hulk.... shes a heeeeeeeeeero and shes infinitely better than bruce banner reeeeeeeeeee
what  you re telling me that brie larson  a woman who has been advocating for more diversity and inclusivity in hollywood  is having trouble working with her black co-star  no. no freaking way bro. that makes no sense. and it would go against everything brie larson has since stood for  as well as make her look petty. i mean  she s still the main star in this movie. so it s not like she s completely taking a back seat.
so basically brie larson lost her marvels. marvels. marbles. it s a joke. please laugh.
colour me blue and call me betty but let s be honest  she or even  the hunger games  lassie ain t no sigourney weaver or - ripley  from aliens as most of you teeny boppers know her as. just let marvel die before they do the ultimate  bait n switch  and give thor a gender swap  and strange pro nouns halfway through the film
why not just recast mrs marvel rather than deal with her bs
like i ve said multiple times. i didn t mind captain marvel. i just don t like brie larson as a person and it s the stuff she pulls like this which is the justification as to why i don t.
what part of  stop making these kinds of videos  don t you understand
i didn t know she was in fast x
i like captain marvel but not who play her brie larson.
the only thing entertaining about the marvels are drama coverage videos about it like this one.
carol danvers has not  and probably won t ever will be a fan favorite. fiege bet on the wrong horse.
classic lara was awesome now shes meh  they ruined her character.
how dumb of a name is the marvels   it sounds like it comes from the same grammatical handbook of something like  me big hungry honestly every time melonie  says the name she sounds like she doesn t know proper speech and it s not her fault
i m black and i thought wakanda forever was a wet sh t sandwich.  i thought captain marvel tragic.  if it wasn t for samuel l jackson and the cat then it wouldn t have been tolerable.  avengers would not have been impacted in the slightest without captain marvel in the slightest aside from rockets crack at her haircut.  there comes a point to where it s just a shock to how these movies are even successful anymore.  highly degraded content nowadays.
what evidence do you have for any of this  leave the poor woman alone  jesus christ!
marvel was going bankrupt when they published these shitty stories in the 90s and 2000s. why  for the love of all that is holy  would they even try to bring them to the screen  da faq ! they went woke very early  and should have gone broke because of it. ironman  the movie  was the only reason they didn t go under. how does disney not know this
if brie larson is in it  i won t be watching it.
first!! edit  aww! i hit refresh  i failed.
bet she is afraid that it will be her last movie  at least in very profitable  still  marvel universe    possibility of its failure is pretty good  her first movie was not that good to begin with and if second will fail there is a good chance there will be no cpt marvel 2. or perhaps she is just a a-hole  who knows.
i am!!
analytics
she is the most unlikeable actress in hollywood!!!
i m look forward to it... bombing.
i really dislike her marvel work but here s the thing.  you know they sold her on being the lead in the movies.  she  white woman won t be leading a black female and latina teenager.  when their own beliefs screw them it makes me want to buy popcorn
hey you re close  and i m proud of you  d
i don t know why because her acting in the movie captain marvel sucked because she didn t put any feeling into the character
stop trying to make fetch happen
probably won t give a fuck about anything mcu unless it s spider-man or deadpool and wolverine
all of the m she u has sucked starting with captain marvel  skipping over endgame and continuing onto today.
to brie s credit she is channeling modern carol d... and what most marvel characters became in the comics.... insufferable.sadly the mouse is still gonna omega double down on the woke trash.  but they did want to tank the ips after all.
yvonne strahovski should be captain marvel. she s a much better actress and not a diva.
the marvels   i d rather see a moon knight movie and where is superman   any spider-man would be way better and that includes the animation.
bad timing for a film  us economy will be in a deep recession by then  i guess they have a built-in excuse of why no one went to see the film
brie larson has done nothing to endear herself to marvel fans at all. she s she reminds that insecure girl that shoves her way into a group acting like she s just so awesome and everyone needs to know who she is  when really  she s quite pathetic  and if people dug under her tough-sounding   popular girl  exterior  they d see she s nothing to write home about and is just scared people wouldn t like who she actually is. most grow out of this in school. she apparently didn t...
the last good mcu movie was spider-man  no way home. marvel has completely pushed me away with their woke garbage and attitude regarding their core fan base.
not to worry.  after this disaster of a movie they will qquietly do away with all the characters in the movie.   if they think antman 3 was bad wait til this pile of absolute shit hits theaters
not me
captain marvel was an ok movie for me  not great but not meh like thor 2  but that said i couldn t care less for the marvels  i didn t care about monica on wandavision and i haven t even seen miss marvel  so 0 hype for this.
brie larson is the most dispiseable woman ever
brie larson - so unlikable she makes jennifer lawrence seem humble and fun.
did not see the first capt. marvel and will not see the second. brie is a bland actress. keep up the vids melonie.
everyone hates b. larson
there are plenty of men that like the female marvel characters just as much as the male characters the problem is hollywood keeps trying to put this woke feminist bullcrap in the female hero movies and that s is ruining them instead of making an actual good movie when these female characters are already strong independent they didn t have to project this crap also captain marvel did suck was terrible
the lowest hanging fruit in the mcu and she wants to be a diva. good lord  and i thought captain marvel s writing was bad
its a hard nope for me.   marvels   nobody wanted this.
she was great in chuck
so  brie is mad again huh whatever it is that pissing her off  i m sure it s the white man s fault again.isn t that right brie
marvel has become outwardly toxic as a brand. id rather not think about it then get called a nazi for not liking a low effort movie series.
remove brie and i will want to watch it. ms. marvel movie sounds great
i m not a woke person at all. i am conservative. but i did like captain marvel. not my favorite marvel movie. my favorite was iron man. my favorite super hero film is the first wonder woman.
no.
lmao what a joke
she was horrible in kong
the mcu has sure turned into a shit show. just love and enjoy ironman all the way to endgame.  it will never get that good in a generation
christian bale says hollywood  and the world  would be better if  white dudes  weren t in charge of everything the actor says there would be  so much better films and so much more interesting stories  if white dudes weren t running hollywood. zack sharf dec 19  2017
noone cares about the marvels.  people don t like captain marvel in the comics or the movies.  the don t really care about ms. marvel either.  mcu was out of gas after avenger endgame.  spiderman 3 was a neat surprise.
marvel movies are for kids and teens.that is 100  fact. the target audience is kids. and these kids and teens now slowly became adults and finally realize that superhero movies are the same story  same movie  recycled over and over again.it is interesting to see how the kids who got upset at a legend in filmmaking like martin scorsese are now agreeing with him.the movies are fun. but they are not oscar material  they are not giving a deeper understanding of the human condition and every single actor in those movies knows that these movies are blockbuster action flicks. the sooner people understand what these movies are  the less misunderstandings will prevail. fun movies. but the vocal minority of the internet needs to understand what these movies are.
super heroes are super people  why do we accept middling homely actresses when the men have to look like chiseled greek gods
i didn t mind the first  captain marvel  film.  brie isn t a good carol danvers.  earths mightiest heros had the perfect carol.  i think the sound track for captain marvel ruined the film.   i grantee duran durans  reflex  or  this is planet earth  woukd have improved the big fight at the end with the alien fleet.  also her fight at the end with... who ever that was  was lame and should be removed.
so much for bringing minorities to the table.
brie s portrayal of captain marvel is not a hard hitter. she s overcompensating  and try hard. the original avengers were the hard hitters of the mcu and with most of them gone it s boring now. spiderman is a good character but i m not gonna see blade if he s gonna be cucked by a little girl. talk about emasculation. that s fuckin terrible.
brie larson is very boring as an actress anyways
im not gonna fuckin watch it anyways i haven t watched a single mcu movie since no way home
cheesy larson fails again.
this brand is dead lol.
i can t stand brie
ms marvel okay cute and charming poton is mature but captain marvel is useless i don t like that character
hey melonie  sure brie larson is a great actres but yes captain marvel was just ok  and yes brie  performance  not the best now the marvel sound weird i wonder if going to be  a good product or just a mediocre woke trash time will tell.
marvel sucks now
other than logan  all the marvel films are trash.
who cares. brie larson should be irrelevant.
instead of constantly talking about woke culture for moneys why don t you innovate. cultivate new ideas on this channel. change the paradigm  be a pioneer. 24 7 woke critik
captain marvel was trash and her attitude issues were more than unlikable. so  who gives a flop
i found captain marvel just boring  it was not an interesting or engaging film. it was not a good story.
captain marvel was terribly written and overall boring and obvious... add her annoying character that had me wishing they had the good guys lose... i don t care to even watch this movie.
i m looking forward to the marvels. you are just sharing rumors. no one accused people who didn t enjoy captain marvel of being a misogynist. you re just pretending you ve been victimized.
the batman is a garbage film.
