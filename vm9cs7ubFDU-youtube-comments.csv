the lotr is already for a modern audience. the trilogy never diminished in age at all. you could watch it in 10 years and it ll still be amazing.
tolkien served in both world wars. he s a master of his craft. he created a world like no other. the man   his life s work deserves a little respect
the work that tolkien did was a reflection of wwi. it is the story of young boys going to war and not all returning  i.e. sam s survivor guilt of coming home to a new wife and child  frodo symbolized death by leaving with the elves . this is the soul of the story. what is being done to this man s work is ripping the soul out and leaving it a husk. it took the most bloody war  and a mans experience in that war  to produce one of the greatest literary works of all time.
peter jackson s lotr is a modern masterpiece that took years to make with everyone a part of it living in new zealand  away from their families with long hours on set and filming the movies back to back! they told tolkien s story  kept it true to the heart and themes of the story as much as they could and has everyone s blood  sweat and tears in it. honestly  trying to remake the trilogy when it hasn t even been 20 years yet since return of the king premiere in theaters  which will be dec 17 2023  is insulting. hell  remaking it in general is insulting. next we ll see disney remaking star wars  a new hope! don t fix what isn t broken!!!
jackson s lotr trilogy has a few bad cgi scenes  but overall it is a masterpiece that really does not need to be replaced.
if it s a remake of a classic. watch the classic!  jay sherman
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.   - j.r.r toliken
i dont want  modern remakes  i want to escape the modern world and go to places and times where timeless constant things like bravery  friendship  love  honor  good and evil all still meant something
if i m a member of a specific  fandom   it s tolkien for sure  more than anything  and i started reading his work more than ten years before the pj movies. i agree that messing with tolkien s world feels a bit like blasphemy. when reading tolkien you really feel that his world is very immersive  words and phrases are carefully chosen  and that there is a heart at the bottom of it all. amazon s take on it was shallow  petty  disrespectful  and surprisingly poorly made.
no! no! please  don t do this. please!!!! this isn t gonna go well
i love the way that was worded. it s for the story  not for the audience. beautiful
we live in a time when the dark 80 s ai can generate better costume designs then the people who currently have that job in  modern  hollywood.
lord of the rings is a timeless masterpiece  please for once can they just leave it that way
it had the perfect blend of fantasy and realism when it came to the story progression of a tumultuous journey along with fighting choreography and villains that defined itself by weight   stakes that brought the genre s sense of scale to life in doing so intertwining beautifully with how big the theme worldbuilding was. this was our generations live-action anime citizen kane.this remake is doa because the other iterations of lotr mastered the art of telling a compelling tale of underdogs raising to the occasion even when the odds where heavily against them and they were pursued relentlessly by an incarnate of evil personified.these studios no longer know struggle besides profit margins they are the ones beating the dogs to death with a rubberband waffle bat cause their heads have gotten too big and their own gas fumes is the only thing that excites them.instead of a tale of triumph over adversity.they ll do it again to push more diversity. actor  go see our movie cause our mc male hobbits are making out and that s never been done before.
anytime i here modern or hollywood  a certain voice just starts playing loud in my head saying  the message!
watched the lotr in the past two weeks with my girlfriend. she s never seen them before and we just saw return of the king today. she absolutely loved all of them  so much so that we bought the books this morning. shame they re making them  modernized  now.
embracer is massive. in this case hopefully it includes the silmarillion  so jackson can throw rop into the cultural memory hole  partly as fidelity to the art  partly as good ol fashioned revenge against amazon.
i ve given up on any and all remakes.  it s just that simple.  i ve largely given up on movies and tv at this point as well.  i don t watch movies in the theater anymore because i insist on reading watching trusted reviews first.  let these culture-destroying media companies ruin as many classic ips as they want  i won t notice.  i have better ways to spend my time and money.
they should hire the same lads who wrote the rings of power. everybody loved that show. i can t think of one bad thing to say about it.
legends like tolkien  and the diminishing of the things we love  is the reason why as a comic creator and author  my work is important to me. i literally began my career with the mindset of  i want to tell stories and create worlds as great and masterful as what we read and watched growing up . there is no heart and soul in the entertainment world anymore. i think not only does it take us voting with our wallets  but it ll take us straight up rejecting these nonsensical ppl in addition to great creators stepping up to take the reigns. when i saw marvel   star wars falling apart  i said  i m gonna take the torch since they clearly can t carry it anymore . we gotta pioneer the world we wanna see.
yep. i never tire of it. it s a brilliant trilogy.
yeah it s literally perfect
i fall asleep trying to watch modern 2 hour movies. i can easily sit through lord of the rings and stay awake.
exactly  peter jackson did a great job of making a timeless adaptation.  any attempt to do a remake will absolutely fail in comparison  and they will be wondering why  and blame the fans
but there are no black people  latin people  asian people and no members of the lbgtquioughkfjdhskl    community in the original movies. that must be corrected. 80  inclusive casting or nothing. heil wokeism!
it s ridiculous they are remaking it. they can t make any technological advances. it s not like it was made in the 60s. they definitely won t improve on the setting  acting  writing and practical effects. it ll pretty much be trash as expected.
you could say the same about every classic hollywood has tried and failed to remake.
agree i still watch them when they are on tv
facts
the books and movies are timeless and need zero changes.   it s everlasting.
the time he spent in the second one was mostly air-warden work and code-breaking  though.
@pringlesjingles  he was also up front with the 11th for 4 months as a battalion signals officer.
woke hacktavists   yes  well counterpoint. he was a straight white christian male.  mic drops  once upon a time i wished for a movie adaptation of dragonlance and or dragonriders of pern. i don t wish this anymore.
@kori miller  dragonlance was definitely epic. the time for stuff like that is passed. i am interested in d d movie though  but we ll see
@dceasedbrickbuilds  is that during ww1 or ww2
@pringlesjingles  2nd. he was more hands on in 1.
@kori miller  the less these fools touch the better.
@dceasedbrickbuilds   i cut my teeth in the trenches at the somme! you larped your santa clause through vietnam!  - j.r.r. tolkien to george r.r. martin in epic rap battles of history
he was also a family man and nature lover. dude was unique man of his own
very well said
couldn t of said it any better
can t believe i didn t see that metaphor...that s so damned moving!
i watched the original trilogy for the first time a couple months ago and loved it! what you say is completely true!
so this channel is basically just another republican reacts to things that trigger them  why are you people constantly crying over change.
@immopimmo  yeah it d be a movie version of bored of the rings  but in a serious tone not a parody. i won t elaborate.
@viva la raza! us army vet  because people like you made a big fuss over jk rowling stating the truth and harassed gamers that played hogwarts legacy. if people like you stopped whinning about  representation  or demanded remakes to appeal to  modern audiences   this would ve been avoided.
that s because tolkien built it on a popular writing technique used by all the most gifted writers in the past  universal storytelling. keep it vague and let the reader fill it in with imagination  good vs evil. love. friendship. betrayal. war. peace. very basic and relatable concepts.not to be confused with world building and detail which tolkien was a master at.
you ever see this peter jackson interview  he said  we didn t want to bring our personal beliefs in the film  we wanted to stay true to the source material  i know i messed up the quote slightly but that s something we need more of.
@anonym anonymer i can literally enjoy a 4 to 5 hour bible movie back then than a 90 min holloweird movie nowadays.
@adam strachn wait till you see j. k. is planning to reboot her harry potter to be more  inclusive .
sounds like whiteman speak
@vivalarazausarmyvet4453  what  lol  i just think a remake is unnecessary when the original can still hold up extremely well today.
i agree with you but maybe update some of the cgi because sometimes older cgi looks cheep on higher resolution tv sets. we now are in 4k realm and then it s going to be 8k.
you know exactly what they mean when they say change for a modern audiences.
the movies are timeless. they don t need to be remade.
i identify as an otter. i want legolas to be an otter in this trilogy  please.
its timeless perfection
and the cgi looks better than the mcu in 2023
we need trans hobbits and gay orcs
modern audience  means the peter jackson trilogy is not antiwhite enough or lgbtq p enough.
as a gen z that it s currently reading the books i firstly experienced the series as a kid playing the lego lotr game but i have vague memories of the story  i confirm that  people from every generation can easily enjoy lotr  and while i didn t watched the movies because i want to finish the books first  i think that s the same for them
i think you ve missed the point of  modern audience  they don t mean modern as in recent times  they mean modern as in reflecting every ridiculous  woke  archetype that could possibly be done. they don t make movies for you or i anymore  they make them for clout and social points.
@adventofknowledge  i understand why they re  really  doing it  but they haven t said it outloud yet.
well said
@christina  techatina   they never need to and if they did  they wouldn t be able to dupe people anymore. thats why reading between the lines is so important and some people  not you  really need to grasp that concept.
at this point hollywood is just trolling.  for real
it s literal perfection.
@adventofknowledge  haha you re absolutely right and it sucks. unfortunately  we are in a world that is comprised of 90  sheep. my original post was towards like  there s no  realistically  justifiable reason to remake them! i m sure the quiet part will definitely be said soon. nowadays  they don t even need to keep it between the lines when the majority is too apathetic to care
@norman readdis  that makes perfect nonsense. i can t wait to avoid it
the original trilogy is not made for a modern audience it s made timeless for every audience to ever exist.
my family and i watch lord of the rings every october and the hobbit every september.
is warner  they came up with velma and tlou bearded guys kissing. they will f it up.
still amazing even 50-100 years from now.
@viva la raza! us army vet  because we don t want t to see our favourite things ruined by identity politics.
@death-king  total recall remake was a complete joke  it didn t even compare to the original. the original still holds up better than most modern movies imo.
and it still holds up because uses practical practical fx most of the time.
yet in 20 given years i ll probably never ever see them same for narnia and star wars and star trek.not that i hate them i just never wanted to.albeit i like anakin and vaders story a lot.and star trek has some interesting lore with the fact it exists supposedly in a moneyless society that somehow works.
@christina  techatina   well that is ultimately and unfortunately the primary goal of it all. i hate bringing deeper politics into the discussion and  cultural marxism  is something of a gimmick  but that is what is happening. the modern lot who are pushing it all  they re trying to do what mao did by force just without the force part. create a  new  man so to speak  that s why all of this nonsense is rampant throughout every single cultural institution. creating an apathetic atmosphere simply allows them to do it more efficiently. it needs to become unprofitable  but clearly that won t be because we wont watch it. so long as there is an internal mechanism to profit off of  hollywood will keep going.
@norman readdis  okay well thats my point.never read potter never will anyways either.i do need to read more books i guess.maybe the metro series i alway played exodus and besides they are written by one based russian man.
@viva la raza! us army vet  there is an enormous difference between bottom up societal change that is organic and top down societal change that is artificial and forced.but then  as not a republican  you would know that and but then being against republicans  this is ultimately what you want isn t it
its too late now  the damage has already been done. i doubt that we will ever get a good show.
@mark strong  amen!
remind me of many chinese light novel where it is based on popular ip  like what if superman learn kungfu so many versions of the same popular ip with little twist here and there  make mc more blood thirsty and more aggressive.and of course mc is now chinese or half chinese.
it got the greatest respect with the first three films. its going to be ruined for financial gain
@kori miller  yes   woke hacktivists dissing a guy who fought actual fascisti.
@j.c. l. tlou technically had gay kissing first.
tbh  though  i eagerly await the day disney announces a star wars remake for two reasons  firstly  a remake would override the original trilogy s place within disney s cannon  thereby freeing the ot from  official  sources saying that the millenium falcon has an sjw-bot in its systems or that luke skywalker was a terrible jedi master who s order immediately crumbled after he tried to kill his own nephew.  secondly  a remake might actually incite enough rage within to fandom to burn lucasfilm   disney studios to the ground.tolkien s work  on the other hand  is still largely unblemished  rings of power having been mostly ignored or disliked by the community at large.  times being what they are  i d rather wb leave lord of the rings alone.
so  abrams stated in the director s commentary of the force awakens that it was a remake of a new hope..... it was not done well.
@nobody s home  jj has never done anything well.  hes an okay director of someone else s script  but thats about it.
you can bet they ve discussed remaking and subsequently ruining  the classic star wars movies lol.
exactly. never try to remake a film franchise that is already and still is a masterpiece. it goes well.
disney already did a soft reboot with the force awakens by that stupid jar jar abrams. they been slowly rewriting things like making obi-wan bisexual lol  . he is a jedi! they are taught too have not any material attachments!
to be honest minus a couple scenes here and there a lot of the cg effects still look pretty good to this day from the likes of gollum or the balrog. certainly when compared to the hobbit.
such as  i can t think of anything egregious.
really  i can t think of anything that comes across as bad. or at least nothing that comes across as distracting.
still better cgi than modern superhero movies for sure...
when you want to replace the strong men in a society you do it thru media and tv shows aimed at the young
considering the effects were being done in like 1999  some of it is phenomenal. the balrog still looks phenomenal.
maybe the army of the dead could be considered dated  but its been 20 years  lotr has aged beautifully
@geralt of rivia  the first horse attacked by the warg on the way to helms deep. it looks bad.
it s not. they aren t  remaking  the movies. they are most likely creating side stories within the lotr universe.
@geralt of rivia  some of legolas stunts look kinda bad  but yeah  overall the cgi is excellent.
few bad cgi  bruh you know that movie came out like 17-18 year s ago ... and still looks really good
@geralt of rivia  the cave troll
the only scene i d get rid of  is legolas in  ttt   where he slides down the stairs while simultaneously killing orcs with his bow and arrow.
@murad  nope. nothing wrong with that.
i like the weird  watch legolas do some crazy crap  moments. there s one in every film and it is simultaneously cool conceptually and ironically enjoyable from a humor level. i love them.
@death-king   compared to rings of power both lotr and the hobbit cgi are good enough
@geralt of rivia  the scene that aged poorly cgi wise imo was when frodo was being wrapped in spider web. but i don t expect every scene to be perfect especially for the time it came out.
in the books legolas walks on top of snow  and he and the elves of lothl rien walk across tight ropes as easily as walking on flat ground  so it s no stretch he could perform those feats you see in the movies.
that stuff could always be remastered  but there doesn t need to be this remake they re pushing.
i got it on 4k and it looks amazing. meanwhile  the cgi orcs in the hobbit movies look terrible even on regular bluray
it reminds me of a tbs commercial of lord of rings interwoven with the song  secret lovers.
they re not remaking the trilogy
buy my book buy my book
if the movie stinks just don t go!
that s right  jay
@super fun happy slide   if the movie stinks  do-si-do.
it d be like if they remade the good  the bad  and the ugly. just stop.
he saw the future and tried to warn us.
@rex lumontad  probably because he experienced first-hand what  weak men create hard times  really means.
same. stop this modern bull crap of his classics. it won t go over well for them. i want escapism. not....this.
what does bravery and honor matter to a trillion dead souls ask them and the silence will be your answer.-mass effect
shallow  petty  disrespectful  and surprisingly poorly made. that about sums it up nicely. especially the disrespectful part.
cope harder
@presswerks  bot
@greaseball_gamer  bigot
lol yes it is  watch. it s gonna be such a box office disaster they wont be able to finish the product. it s gonna be so embarrassing! let them destroy themselves  watch and laugh  and dont try to stop them  the dragon is eating itself. thats what s happening here.
ring of power was bad enough!
@presswerks  is that supposed to be an insult  lol
@presswerks  imabigit
@presswerks  yes we are bigots and we are proud. at least we re not delusional.
ffs  calm down. the article was clickbait  and melonie shouldn t have panicked about it. wb and embracer have stated  covered in better articles  that they are not going to remake anything that s already been done in previous productions. it s gonna be ok bro lol.
@presswerks  nice troll 8 10
@das pooch  you never know these days  i can t blame her lol
totally! that was the perfect response. the best part is  it s true. the movie  or tv show  is supposed to reflect the story and not the audience.
no kidding.
serves
go aweeey noow
i hear these two words and think they can t possibly double down and do worse and then i hear the jurassic park theme song followed by goldblum saying  nature finds a way
...in a slurred fashion.  almost like the guy saying it was critically drunk.
@falcon_by_the_lake   well said! lolz
@orion  you re welcome  and hail!
felt like that s all for today
there s just no way it s not that. if it was faithful  why even remake it  jackson nailed it and they couldn t win.
it s as if hollywood is saying  we want to make movies for everyone except for al bundy  because he s a bad person .
@synthetic reality  believe it!
to appropriate the meme   based and middle earth-pilled.
no  it doesn t include the silmarillion.
embracer group is the same entity that owns limited run games  who fired their community manager for tweeting about  hogwarts legacy .
i read and watch the classics. ignoring the new stuff. because the new stuff isn t made for people like me.  pragmatic individuals.
@nobody s home  100

roflmao
your funny
oh  i like you. lol
@the truth is here  my mam says i m funny looking.
theres so many comments like these on these vids and yet no one ever says what they even work on.and honestly the world i want to see is one where humans finally show some real improvement but instead it feels like another cycle.
@chandller burse  have you ever asked people what they work on  or do you just expect everyone to unapologetically self promote in someone s comment section  doesn t even make sense  you see so many  comments like this  but if you did you d clearly have read i said i m a comic creator. there s your answer  comic books. if you are referring to what specific comic they re working on  why not ask them instead of thinking they d outright say the project by name...and you said you d like to see a world with real improvement  but i said we have to pioneer the world we wanna see. you wanna see real improvement  really improve yourself. so idk what any of this comment even is
when i heard the news that lord of the rings was getting rebooted for  modern audiences  i got sick to my stomach.
lotr is timeless
there are plenty of areas of jrr tolkien s world to explore without them redoing the lord of the rings.
never stop the tomb raider detours  lol. that and the constant pronunciation issues are gold. the only thing better is the wholesomeness of your language substitutions
your views are spot on! i feel your hurt too  this doesn t need to happen! the only sliver of light is that it involves some of the same people involved in the original  maybe they are talking about doing other stories tolkien made in middle earth...also very much agree with tolkien and his faith  i think it shows when you realise the lotrs books are in the top 5 best selling books behind the quran and the bible! anyway love your videos  take care  3
one of the greatest polish poets once told that in the case of great art a reader should be spending this amount of time contemplating it as the writer on creating it. maybe thats why we tolkien fans are fans for life    and you know that it was 14 years to write lotr
i ve watched the lotr series  probably a dozen  times. and i never get tired of it. if they can t make it to that standard  just don t bother.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin good forces have invented or made -j.r.r. tolkien
there are plenty of ips out there that reflect the  modern audiences .  take a look at the streaming libraries  most titles you see show poc  girl bosses  race swapping  and man shaming.  it is myoptic to think every show needs to reflect that  because what s  modern  is always interpeted by the ideology that defines it. we are not all conformists. many of us are entertained by more traditional approaches to storytelling.
why   the story cannot be told any better than jackson did.
oh good grief  they just couldn t leave it alone  the movie is stands up to the test of time. that s why it s such a great film. i m huge fan of tolkien. this is such horrible news  as rings of power wasn t bad enough.
i m pretty much the same way  being skeptical is my default mode when it comes to entertainment.  growing up it would always annoy me when my dad would be critical of certain things  but now i definitely get it.the whole concept of making it for a  modern audience  will always be flawed.  the  modern audience  is never consistent  it always changes  it s the same reason   politically correct  is a flawed concept because politics change.  if a movie is made for a  modern audience  then it will eventually become irrelevant  but if a movie is made like the original lord of the rings trilogy or even the original star wars trilogy they ll be timeless and able to be enjoyed by anyone.  i got into the star wars movies when i was a kid in the 90s  long after they were originally made in the 70s and 80s  if they want to make a good movie then they need to throw out such fickle concepts as a  modern audience  and  politically correct .  there is no constant revenue in these methods  it s simple business  don t go making a temporary fad like the macarena if you can make something awesome like a journey song.hope i didn t talk too much  great video as always  have a good one!!!
that quote cites bringing tolkien to the screen in  new and exciting ways.  it certainly implies they won t remake frodo s story as told in the lord of the rings. comments from warner bros pictures group co-ceos michael de luca and pam addy also support that.so no.. if they try  we can point to this quote
the fact that the majority of films shows nowadays are repurposed  reboots remakes   the chance of success is already 50 50 at best! but  every time i hear they ll be repurposed in a  modern  setting  it s automatically dead on arrival!
another great video melonie. always good to see you and coming up with great topics to talk about. and looking forward to the next live stream.  biggitarmy  chaotichufflepuff.
always great to see a new video    have a blessed friday  melonie.
i made the right call to buy the original lord of the rings trilogy at the store when i had the chance. even though they aren t the extended versions of the films  it s still a fun   long ride. people who keep rebooting these franchises in modern times just do this out of spite   keep insulting or bullying fans of the classic films  shows or games  because they don t or never will admit that they themselves fucked up   should just stop ruinint established   well known ip s.
jackson s trilogy is almost as timeless as tolkien s books are. there s a little cgi aging in the return of the king when jackson got a little too excited about cgi in the battle of the pelennor fields. but not nearly as bad as most of the stuff marvel is pumping out right now. jackson s trilogy will last for decades. but i m smelling a very very very strong  lucas want s to do a special edition to cover up award winning special effects with dated cgi  vibe in this announcement.
wtf .... i m dumbfounded.  i watch the extended trilogy every year   they are perfect
classics  are called that for a reason.  that reason being they stand the test of time.  people just can t leave things alone.  it s all about their narrative.
the words everyone hates
the first thing i hear is cj from gta  ah shit here we go again.
@death-king  hope for the best prepare for the worst
every time and age and culture got its own politics and ideologies i guess. i m sure that  those guys in homer days used their own  political ideologies  to support their wars and warriors and such    but the great works of art  including art of storytelling  are deemed as classics becouse their works applicability to humane condition and mythical epicness wont expire after a 50 or 100 years    thats why they stood the test of time
unless he s in charge
well he also did the hobbit. wonder what changed his mind there and convinced him to alter so much
@nousos  the company wanted a trilogy even tho it should ve been 2 with tel toro and they basically just gave it to peter to try to fix up the mess
@boomingbob1579  and they still made billions with changes made. lesson learned that people didn t care enough so more changes incoming.
jackson to be fair never intended on directing the hobbit and was more or less forced too by the studio due to guillermo del toro s departure.
books
@death-king  if you ask me  jackson save the hobbit trilogy.
@nousos  del toro initially was going to direct it but he left because he was going to miss his children growing up. say what you want but that was hit priority. jackson stepped in and had to salvage what del toro envisioned for 2 films. suddenly i think it was warner brothers someone correct me decided instead of 2 movies it was now going to be a trilogy so then jackson had to somehow stretch it for 1 more movie and we know what the end result was. to be fair  compared to rop  maybe we ve been too harsh on the hobbit movies
@andrew espinoza  people said the exact same for the prequels after the shitfest that was the disney sequel trilogy.
@jabrock obiden unless we re talking about the original books....
@andrew espinoza  it was everything surrounding smaug that upset me the most  but tbh my fear is that again  hollywood sees  some changes  making billions and be liked in hindsight.so they will keep trying their changes.
@nousos  jackson salvaged what he could for the hobbit. unfortunately he really got screwed over with it and simply did not have the time to do much better  plus he was dealing with his own health issues at that point.
nothing wrong with you teaching about your faith and god imo
i watched it many times  they use to play it on my local tv couple of years ago for almost entire year  all three movies  and we never got tired of it. it s like no matter how many times you watched it  you can always leave it play in background and only watch some of the coolest moments.also  i have  kid  sister  she s now 20  couple of years ago when she was teen we watched entire trilogy together and she loved it  which says a lot considering she s not really into movies because she hates  sitting around   yet she had no issue watching hours and hours of lotr trilogy. she kinda hated hobbit tho.
i don t know what it is  but when it comes to lord of the rings i have such an easy time laughing at all the modern stuff and separating it from the lotr we know and love. it does not bother me because my brain really does see them as two completely different things. its weird because i m also a huge star wars fan but all the new stuff really bothers me because my brain connects it much more to the original movies  and i have a hard time laughing it off. not sure why  but at least lotr seems incorruptible in my mind.
alex steins show looked like a lot of fun  that freestyle was so goofy  loved all the points you guys covered!
love it. can t wait to see what a flaming train wreck this turns out to be.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.  - jrr tolkien.
one does not simply change tolkiens original work into their own spin... - boromir
the reason we see so many timeless established friendships suddenly become gay relationships  is because the writers have never truly experienced such a friendship.
i don t think that it s remakes. the impression that i get is that they re making more movies connected to the peter jackson trilogies  based on some of tolkien s material that hasn t been adapted yet   the children of hurin    beren and luthien   etc .
wb be like  rings of power went so well for amazon  lets reboot the og trilogy .
they  don t want to change the old stuff. they want to destroy it! especially pop culture masterpieces.   let the past die. kill it if you have to rip star wars franchise  i will never forget
come on hollywood  my expectations literally can t get any lower yet they still manage to disappoint me.
whatever weirdness the studios try to insert into tolkien s middle-earth  they will be up against the most dedicated fandom. amazon s fiasco should serve as an example  if an adaptation is to be produced and it s a genuine attempt to represent tolkien s works  they will make revenue. personally  i am not holding my breath on a successful adaptation of anything. i am aware of the political and social silliness of the moviemaking business  i am ready to be part of the  toxic fans  that will be blamed for the pushback when their  faithfully modified  work fails to hook an avid audience.
your thumbnail is probably gonna be true  i m 23 and sadly very late to watching these movies  literally just watched them earlier this month  but i do adore them  i was always into fantasy. anyway i m the movies i found frodo and sam had a very close relationship which despite todays culture i understood it was brotherly love. but i can see how people probably shipped them two due to those scenes
i thought it wasn t going to be a remake. sauron s war didn t just go on at gondor and mordor. sauron also invaded the north where events in the hobbit took place  erebor  dale  lorien  the enchanted forest  king dain ironfoot and king brand  thranduil  perhaps even galadriel and celeborn went to war during lotr.
yo girl  you just got yourself a french subscriber. love your content and good vibes. keep it up
i think if they did something new that is outside of the established lore... and yes didn t push a lot of social commentary in obvious ways... i think that might be fun.  i m hoping for that.
after reading the kyoshi novels  i understand the pain of tombe raider fans.
making it for a modern audience would kill the story before it even begins. frodo would never leave the shire due to crippling anxiety.
i agree with you cuz even though i m personally not a fan of lord of the rings i went to school with a lot of people who grew up watching them so to them it s gonna feel like their childhoods are gonna be burned right in front of them and since the creator is a catholic christian then hollywood is just gonna have a field day tearing into his work and probably use it as a way to  prove a message .
i hope they will do it and spend 1 billion on it!
all full with black actors of course
they shouldn t
if that is the case  then why are studio people execs and media calling it a remake
@nobody s home  i haven t seen any instance of them doing so.
@east bow  don t forget the lgbtqaaehlnjk  and the disabled community. they all must be included. also the  strong independent women

from what i understand pj is in the mix. he s not owed the benefit of the doubt which goes to show you how the low bar is for the lotr franchise.
i think we forget that these tv shows and movies take years to make. when they announce these things  they re probably already half way through production and can t go back.
i m actually excited by this news. after the disaster that is rings of power  i really don t think wb is not going to take a good look at how badly the show was received and follow suit. especially if peter jackson and phillipa boyen indeed do become involved  you can bet that they will make absolutely sure to assemble an experienced  competent and passionate creative team. hopefully they don t make the same mistake of injecting identity politics and other modern social narratives into it. i think a good deal of people would agree that we are collectively tired of being preached to in our media  especially the high fantasy genre. i want some great storytelling with heart and emotion that honors the professor and respects his work. that s it. please deliver that to us all wb!
9 30 i totally agree with your assessment on it feeling akin to blasphemy. i think it s mainly got to do with how devoid of religion the western world has become. these people hold nothing sacred in their pursuit of self gratification  hence why great works of art from past auteurs are only seen as mere stepping stones for them. they have no respect for others  but crave for it to no end.
theres a reason it is and was as popular as it is.  changing it for a  modern audience  that already loves the work is the best and fastest way to drive fans away.we already love the books  and jackson s movies .  changing things makes things not what we fell in love with  and we ll reject it.
my late father loved lord of the rings. unfortunately  he passed away before the peter jackson movies.
i d swear  its like im in a nightmare and i cant wake up.....this is getting insane.
well said!  this is exactly what i thought when gary mentioned this on his twitter.
they re not remaking the original trilogy  they re making new movies in the universe. they re so many stores to be told
it will come full circle. evil cannot create  it can only corrupt and destroy what is good.
there is no such thing as  the modern audience  all these studios are doing is making movies for a small group of people that will never look up from their twitter accounts long enough to even watch a movie  and lotr is timeless and the movie trilogy is a cinematic masterpiece.
i wish we could get a good dragonlance adaption.
they want you to hate yourself   because they absolutely loathe themselves.
the  hell naw  meme comes to mind everytime i hear that they want to change it for  current  audiences.     peter jackson s was close enough and is a beloved classic.
sir tolkien s name is pronounced  tol-keen   not  tolken . even in the 2019 biopic  the professor made sure to correct his mentor and anyone else who mispronounced his name.
god bless you melonie  and may mr tolkien rest in peace
just found your channel. thanks for being one of the very few women to voice your opinion when the world can be so hostile against your viewpoints. it gives hope haha.
melonie mac can raid the tomb of my heart
still watch lord of the rings yearly twice a year usually
last year the company that bought the rights said that they want to focus on character movies  for example an aragorn movie  legolas movie  gimli movie etc.
or anything by lackey  mccaffery  asimov  anthony  niven  freidman..... and the list goes on for thousands of authors...... .there are billions of stories that could be made into successful movies or shows. yet we keep getting the same things done worse.
remember  it is only escapism if it is written to reflect modern day reality.
what have we learned  don t mess up the classic
i think  modern audience  has become a trigger word for me  but i love the world that exist within the pages of the lord of the rings so if they do it well with respect to the the work i ll be happy for years.
they could do ones based on the video games they were cool.
it s everywhere. 1984 should be fiction  but is rapidly becoming factual.
lord of the rings is perfect just the way it is. it s doesn t need a reboot or more abominations for  modern audiences .it feels like someone is trying to destory tolkien s legacy. this is absolute madness!
this is a pretty sensationalized take  i understand  not believing  when they say they re not re-making the films  but adapting more stories of tolkiens in the same film canon from jackson and company. read the full statement from dz.
peter jackson s trilogy is timeless epic  we dont need remake
they re not remakes  they re separate stories in the same universe.
if it were warner animation group  and they announce and animated remake of lotr  everyone will instantly eat it up like it s the best thing that ever happens to mankind in progressive current year.
you were awesome last night on stein s pimp on a blimp show!!
i just want men in the west and the  blue wizards thats what i am crawing most of the lord of the rings lore. it can t be worse than the rings of power direction can it xd
each day a new modern movie or show based on tolkiens work gets released i ll be at home watching the lord of the rings trilogy extended editions.
watch them reframe the whole narrative of the movies with the the smallest changes. they know what they are doing.
this will never stop. it s about an agenda  not profits.
still smart. still beautiful. stand your ground  ms. melonie.
if they go ahead with this  i will pretend it doesn t exist  just like the star wars sequels.
what the hell is even that !   -some old dad  homeowner and inspiration for a great meme
i don t think they announced remakes  melonie  i think they specifically said that it s gonna be some new story from the universe.
contact me for your reward
good job melonie. nice work. i like it. thank you. i agree.
to quote sidney prescott in scream 4  you forgot the first rule of remakes  don t fuck with the original
we made billions of off tolkien when we worked with jackson! lets keep the franchise!  so.... you would like to grab creative minds like peter jackson  fans of the genre  the source material  an experimental filmmaker   no. get the cheapest team we can. we do not pay creatives now  you idiot.
is war of the rohirrim gonna be one of those films  i hear it ll be the only lords of the rings film from wb animation.
so  how do you view the original story by tolkien from his faith-based perspective
wb is hurting for money  i hope this isn t a soulless cashgrab. these things should be made with love and respect that tolkien put into his world. stories that elevate humanity and unite us all. if they really wanna make money  produce epic quality with heart and soul and you will have devoted fans for life...
this is gonna sound hostile towards whomever it hits. if you like what ff vii remake is doing but also love lord of the rings  i hope you get a story where frodo gets visions of the future as soon as he puts on the ring  some ghosts come in to steal those memories from him because he is not supposed to have them even though it is sauron s new plan  and he has travelled through time to mess the story up so that he can win. the whole story is about a hidden force wanting the lotr story to play out  but  small  differences makes the party end up killing the gods after just the fellowship of the ring in a realm beyond time and space.
honestly  i enjoyed the faith-based tangent.
oh and i also love your gfuel characters in the background code mac everybody just saying
blasphemy is the exact word i thought of regarding tolkien s work with rop
the greatest trilogy ever made does not need a reboot
stupid twitter take  the old movies didn t reflect a modern audience.  - bossmanperfect response   it s supposed to reflect the story  not the audience.  - aristophanes
sigh.. this is why christopher tolkien didn t want his dads legacy left in the wrong hands. and here we are... my biggest fear is them touching the silmarilion....
we need this!
they can t be real. those movies are not even that old and they have not aged poorly at all.
tolkien in heaven  sees what they re doing to his work  and tries to jump down with a sword  swearing in dwarvish and elvish c.s. lewis  tolkien s best friend   holding a flailing angry tolkien back no. we re not allowed to do that.
tolkien fans are not gonna back down. we will defend tolkien s masterpiece against those freaks!
this is even getting into our games...!
loves the audio  melts at the owl tat.  love them birds.  i don t want to sit through another 9 hours of lotr
you would think they would have learned from rings of power.
there is no curse in elvish  entish  or the tongues of men for this treachery .
i can see where an animated mini-series might be able to deliver some things better  or things cut-from  the movie trilogy.it could re-introduce tom bombadil  for example. maybe it could clear up that eowyn was a flawed character and learned her lesson. for me that would be a massive improvement over the movies  right there.and being animated 20 years later  they could do things with cgi that the original live-action couldn t. try to imagine how the scenes between elves  men  dwarves and hobbits could be shot with the characters being their actual relative size  rather than having to use forced-perspective.
the only sections that aged at all really was just the mines of moria everything else still looks solid and even better than some stuff made today.
have you watched rrr it is an indian movie with all the traditional storytelling it is available on netflix would love to see your review of it.
this girls voice is weird  and i love it for some reason. is it an accent  or a dialect  i find it mesmerizing.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.
hey melonie! and yes wokeness goes for everything. you look good. hope you re well
imagine writing a story you poor your heart and soul into only to have it completely misconstrued and basically destroyed by hollywood
agreed movie remakes are suppose to reflect the what are base off of. i just know that some day they are going to make their own books base off what they want and it not going to see and they ll still blame fans.
anybody remembering the ben hur remake  no  well that s how good this idea is
by  new and exciting   it is hoped they mean  we re not re-making the original trilogy  but rather they plan on bringing other storylines to the big screen.
should we start taking bets on whether the frodo x sam ship will happen in the remake  or is that too low of a hanging fruit
can t wait to see body positive gollum eating raw celery
the original cast and adaptation was perfect they can t remake this better even if they pour all their money on it.
people like peter jackson in the entertainment industry used to be easier to find  now they re like shiny pokemon hiding in the grass
wb  we are remaking lotrme  do you hate money
im getting serious sw sequel whiplash.. but if they think those whent poorly with the fanbase they got another thing coming with a lotr modern remake.. armour up and gatekeep. peter jackson got it right..  our job is to tell tolkiens story  not push our own nerrative and agendas ..
tolkien update  it s confirmed that peter jackson will involved in new lotr movies  but...hope that they aren t remaking lotr trilogy. we shall see soon.
imagine if they announced they were remaking sons of anarchy for a modern audience.
while tolkien  from what i ve been told  tried not to introduce christian themes into lotr  he was  as you said  a devoutly religious man. his british culture and christian values and perspective could not help but be reflected in his storytelling.just as modern marxists cannot tell a story without it reflecting their...  values  and  perspective ... and that s what the assault on lotr is about and why it can t work  they want to keep the popularity of the story while replacing tolkien s christian values with their marxist values  not realizing that it is those christian values that make lotr timeless . the value lotr has for them is not its messaging  but its audience.
don t tempt fate.
imagine thinking a film series that won 13 academy awards and was nominated for 17 of them would need a remake. i hate with every fiber of my being modern western audiences.
i think it doesn t really matter.because i doubt that something like the lotr trillogy can be recreated or improved  skateboarding legolas aside .we ve got incredible lucky with this one.
the problem is they want to change classical works of art to fit modern life  they think modern audiences are too stupid and have such short attention spans and will complain that the movie doesn t  speak  to them because they re not  represented   so they have to change the movie to accommodate everyone when in reality they are actually pissing everyone off.
5 00 exactly.. i don t wanna turn on a movie or tv show and see the same thing i see when i walk outside.. the whole point is to break from reality and familiarity  suspend disbelief and dive into a different world . if i wanna see myself i ll look at a mirror
reject modernity  embrace tradition.
i want to believe that after the amazon fiasco studios will be smart enough to not try to make these movies for  modern audiences   embracer s gotten a black eye from saints row  and wb s been pretty proactive about pulling terrible movies. still  i can t help but feel like this will be a disaster. maybe just a  hobbit  level disaster  but i ll take that over rop as the lesser of two evils. poorly executed bloat is still better than coopting a story for someone else s ideological worldview.also to clarify  i would absolutely not want to see the lotr film trilogy remade  i d much rather they try for some of the first age stories since the second age has already been tainted heavily and it has much more content that hasn t been adapted yet written in a lot of detail.
can t they at least wait until rings of power has rewritten so much of the story that a  modern remake  of the original trilogy will at least make sense in their twisted world  it would be an amazing reward for the dozens of people that will love that version  so i hope they ll wait another decade or three
when i watch the hobbit and lotr i want to see middle earth  if i wanted to see a freak show i would go to ny or la.
yeah no the thumbnail no. them are brothers to me. through thick and thin the hardships frodo was going through sam was his rock a soild  friend  that became his brother at the very end of the journey. modernism would be another stab in the book of tolkien s work. his life put into literature
with you on this one miss mac.
stop remaking stuff. make new things!
1 28 it s possible that all the finger wagging in movies is their attempt at creating a perpetual struggle session.
how about making one  or if you have to  two at max  hobbit movie s  that are actually closer to the book
happy friday  besto friendo! the rings of power crew may end up hating that these remakes exist if they end up being good  bahahahah! i will say that modern remakes of the lotr movies are not needed because the lotr movies still hold up today. i ll have hope that they will be decent at the very least.
just re-release the originals on the big screen. people will go to watch it. i would.
you tell em! they ll frig it up for sure
if they were to do this i d rather it be an adaptation of the shadow of mordor games tbh. that way it s already non canon and plus the story from those games were pretty well done imo
i m a big fan of the chronicles of narnia i ll get mad if hollywood messes with this classic book series
i think they re trying to subtract the christian elements tolkien placed into his stories.
every time hollywood puts their fingers into something they destroy it.
and paint happy little trees!
@immopimmo  no mistakes  just happy accidents.
in droves.
can t be worse than amazon but if they do i ll be impressed
don t give them ideas
i want this to happen. i want them to spend hundreds of millions of dollars and very few people show up. i want them to lose massive amounts of money.
they have already stated they are not going to  remake  the war of the ring and jackson s original trilogy. the wb new line project have jackson  boyens and walsh on board every step of the way. important to clarify that. incidentally  you never would have had rings of power if it were not for jacksons trilogy. as much as i m fond of those three films i wish they had never been made.
i wish bros could just be bros without having to be broke back mountain bros.
audio level is a bit low on few last videos. i think it was a bit louder previously
jesus christ  gandalf wasn t joking when he said dark times are coming.
jackson and team are supposed to be part or in charge of the new series of movies.
the peter jackson trilogy is already modern  it is definitely not a 1 1 translation of the books. all you have to do is compare it with the books and animated movies to see why. peter jackson made a huge effort to streamline the story of of the lord of the rings into a cinematic master piece that anyone could watch under a reasonable amount of time in a theater  a huge challenge considering how dense the books are . if peter jackson didn t make the movies for modern audiences  they would each be like 5 hours long  have a hundred more side characters that would need screen time  the language that characters use would be more flowery and elegant and there would be a lot more singing and poems. i definitely agree with you that adapting a film for  modern audiences  just means pushing a political message that was never part of the original story that tolkien wrote.
i wish someone would make a good  dragon lance movie    key word good
the key problem being social media in general  i have said this before  in the past there are plenty of woke elements in movies series before 2000  no one cared  as long as the movie series was good.
duplicating something is really hard.  especially if you don t understand it.  so they probably said  bucket  we are going to do it this way.
modern remakes... that will solidify the greatness of the originals  as the new ones fail on every level no doubt. i can t wait to see what happens.
comfort coltrane may not be sufficient. but if it s trash  i still have blus of the extended heptology.  i still like the hobbit trilogy a lot. and if i want a more specific adaptation  i ve still got the 90 minute rankin-bass.
my dad likes the  lotr movies and he hates it when too much is changed.
i don t think wb will make this work without murdering the lore tolkien had made for one reason. that reason is dc.
more lotr with  the message
summer  remember when the boys made us watch that movie about the gay guys on the mountain marissa   sigh  the lord of the rings
i m honestly okay with this  the sooner companies go bust  the sooner someone who actually cares will purchase the ip.
if we wanted this we would just watch main stream media
when my anger to this news is so prolific  it sounds like legendary godzilla s atomic breathe powering up
warner bros announces a new remake of lotr for the esg investors
that ll teach them a lesson fr
well put!
i just watch lord of the ring two nights ago and i see nothing for it to be remake  it fine for what it is and it shows people back then put so much love into them movies back then. so no i hope they cancel this idea because i fear the worst if they  remake  a already great modern trilogy
that don t want creativity they want conformity and compliance.
hollywood  needs  to  be  reminded   that  they  are  supported   by  the  fans  and  this  insult to tolkien  with  be a  duel disaster. for  the fans    the bank   accounts of  everyone  funding  it.
they just cannot leave things alone.
j. r. r. tolkien was a devout roman catholic from boyhood  and he described the lord of the rings in particular as a  fundamentally religious and catholic work  unconsciously so at first  but consciously in the revision .  could we possibly  start respecting the author  whatever story or storyteller is adapted... and by proxy  the audience  possibly fostering their imagination and escapism in the process
what can men do against such reckless hate !  -king theoden  the two towers
i just came across your channel. love it. new sub here.
i can t imagine for one moment that this will go well.
you go girl  preachif we don t speak up the rocks will....
hi melonie. can you make a video about hogwarts legacy selling 12 million copies in just 2 weeks and gaining  850 million! it s hilarious how useless the boycott was  thanks for the free marketing. just helped more people discover a great game xd
that s why i watch anime! 100times better
i m all 4 a remake if it s good
don t let the fruit loops change you. they want to bring people down to their level and its just sad.
not remakes  nobody can remake jacksons movies but if anything they ll touch upon various points in time within the rights they have of the eras they can write about that they have the rights to. hopefully jackson is involved unlike the show who punked him.
heck  just put the trilogy in theatres for a week once a year easy money.
have fun tolkien fans. it s your turn on this ride.
i can t wait for they them the movie or a modern take in the passion of christ
in 2002 i ve put my tv set on the sidewalk  i haven t gone to a theater since 2005-2006 and i m buying less games than ever  almost only indie games .
they never learn lmaothe entertainment industry s biggest companies seem to be competing to see who can bleed money the most.
as a catholic fantasy writer myself i heavily agree
he also punked us with  jackson presents the hobbit
i watch movies from the 80s and 90s. i play diablo 2 resurrected and mario kart.hrnmm.  currently rewatching daria....
so far  wb games did a decent job with the middle earth games series  but when it comes to  wb movies or tv shows...
can t wait for the snider cut
if hollywood is so determined to burn itself down  then i think we should all invest in marshmallows.
melonie the thumbnail is epic
some articles are saying that it won t be a set of remakes based on the comment  explore in new and exciting ways . it ll all be based on materials that haven t been adapted to the screen yet. not that i m holding my breath.
jesus  they re going to destroy every single franchise they touch
i bought my blue ray extended trilogy months before the release of rop. i hate what hellyweird has been doing to beloved classics for a while.
warner brothers you shall not pass!
hollywood has become a real world mordor.
all they maybe need to do is rework some of the cgi  f.e. the charge of gandalf and the rohirrim in helms deep looks a bit weird now  but it only needs some redue of the textures and the ragdoll movement. but everything else is just brilliant  why is a remake nccessary....
lotr is timeless  no need for modern shit. anyway  there s noway they would invest themselves as much as jackson and his team did  i mean  years of preparation before filming  2 years of non stop filming and editing  with thousands of hands working on it.i bet they ll just do everything on green screen and that s it.
i think we will need to teach these broken creatures this lesson ones more
you don t put a mustache on the mona lisa. you don t mess with tolkien. how hard is that to figure out  modern audience...right.
these  modern remakes  are literally killing of the originals... we can t let this happen mel!!!!
well peter jackson and his team are supposedly on bored for these with wb so i think we will be in good hands
the hollywood writers of old had life experiences they traveled abroad they went to universities that taught them how to write the world as it is not how they made it up in their head. they were cultured they were educated in different walks of life or at the very least able to sympathize and relate to people who were not of the same nationality or demographic of them not try to shoe horn people into what they believe there identity should be.
i am not sure it has been specified that it is a remake yet  just something set in that time period and world. the movie rights.
lord of the rings even made shot for shot it would have an impossible task of living up to the original trilogy. any lord of the rings trilogy should be created with the books as its script. this way easy money can be made.the likely reason they are making the films at all is due to copyright. i would also point out that their is many other areas of lore they could make movies out of.
when i saw this video pop up  i started yelling  no!  stop fixing what isn t broken  warner bros!
wb vs amazon  will it be a competition to see who can make the most woke version of lotr !
i really wish that they would focus on making new things. there s dozens of books and other stories out there that they could tell.
they announce a show i will never even thing of watching lol
madtv did a really great version years ago.  i just don t see why they keep remaking it.
if any indication from dcu slate  we should fear for next lotr  harry potter iterations
so they are finally ending it at the  logical closure point  see  clerks 2  for explanation . despite what people may or may not want to see  it at least makes sense.
if there are humans in the film  you have been represented  lets get back to telling a good story that makes sense.
i hope warner bros. does remake it. in fact i hope they go further and start remaking even more movies. the sooner this already broke company is shattered the better for all of us. keep hitting pop flies wb! you can be like current disney if you try hard enough i.e. stock value cut in half.
so  i turned up my volume and the beep was at  we don t want your beeeeeeeeeeeep  i put my hand over my mouth
this is insane
honestly i want these companies to make the wokest most trash movies imaginable or  re-imagineable  so they can start to bleed money and eventually get sold so that maybe we ll get a chance at having something worth watching in a couple of years. since movies are so unwatchable right now anyway this is the perfect time to bankrupt them by denying them our money.
we don t want it  but it s what they re going to make.
i appreciate the warning so i can ignore the next attempt to assassinate tolkien lore
see this is why i brought up rings of woke when i saw this announcement in that tweet
seems like the whispers were true... prepare for disney level star wars content sludge loli would love a new lotr fantasy movie  properly done but that seems like a distant dream.this feels like it ll be  make soft reboot  lose money  blame fans  call everyone ists and phobes  rinse and repeat .
it s like if wb doesn t ransack it s properties for more nostalgia bucks  they ll go out of business.
they re gonna use the clerks ii lotr ending
we don t need a modern remake of lord of the rings  we have a modern adaptation already. warner bro s needs to do better and be creative.
i can t take much more bad news.
as a kiwi i am very protective of the lord of the rings trilogy and i dont think they need to make a modern remake. the movies are not that old.
billions. not dozens. but billions.
@nobody s home  at this point one would be nice.
this is why i pray we never get  a harry potter live action reboot for the  modern audiences .
i m making up my own stuff in my head for years now  so my money will stay in my pocket and they can just eff themselves
i would make melonie the director of a new tomb raider movie or game. she would be shy at first and not really want to have a heavy hand but after a little while she would be be smoking a cigar and pounding her first on a desk demanding deadlines are met
they are destroying it because you love it.it s just pure spite at this point.
i am cautiously opptomistic for henry cavil for the warhammer40k show because the show is going to be on amazon
the bar was set by the classics now they re looking to lower the bar
i am seeing more and more young people that want more than their 15 minutes of fame in this day and age by going with whats popular.
imagine the insane arrogance you have to have to look at jackson s trilogy and think you can  improve  it.
i wonder why this keeps happening are they just creativity bankrupted or does remaking something that was good sounds like guarantee profit that mixing in current year sound like a good idea cause you get both audiences
wow  a lotr remake! i am so excited to sit at home and not give a shit!
it s known fact that a lot of lotr is inspired by the bible. about morgoth and sauron morgoth is based on lucifer. his motivation is arrogants  his goal is to destroy what is  and to be able to create. and he is the personification of chaos and anger.sauron is based on lucifer aswell  but he has the far more nuanced character. he is arrogant aswell  but he is the personification of order. of corrupted order  controll.the valar  like morgoth  are something like main aspects. wind  earth  water  hunt and animals  justice and death  stars and light  sadness and empathy  nature and plants  or fate or other things. so there are pretty  simple  main aspects. so morgoth is a more simple character.but sauron is maia. each valar has a few maia who serve them. he and saruman were maia of the valar aule. aule was about earth  and crafting. he created the dwarfs. he was a bit like melkor  because he wanted to create life. but he didn t want to controll. and eru  the god in lotr  said him  dwarfs just will be true life  if he would order them to do so. but he didn t want to. he wanted to destroy them  to not have to controll them. so eru gave them life  spirit  because of compassion and sympathy for aule.and order and perfection is one of the aspects of earth and craftsmanship. but corrupted  it s controll and following orders perfectly. that s why sauron doesn t want to destroy. to have order  you need something that exists. and in his  perfect  world  everything would be frozen. sculptures. pretty. but if you can t get that  you need controll. so that s his motivation  and why he made f.e. the ring to rule them all. it s about creating binds to controll. and as craftsman  as blacksmith  and as someone who likes pretty stuff  he uses something pretty for that  what you can craft. so rings. others maybe would have chosen something like a coat. for rulers. others maybe a throne. maybe others would use a building  others plants. a bit like the tree in minas tirith. but he is order  and craftsmanship  so he created rings.i don t know if there is an angel you could compare sauron to. and it s inspired by a lot of things. by a lot of myths. but you have to keep in mind  a lot of religions share core elements. the dragon in the bible  the midgard snake for ragnarok. the one  evil son of the god. loki  kronos  even if uranos wasn t good aswell  and did to the titans pretty much what kronos did to the gods. kronos with his scythe like death. so you see  a lot of things are connected or simular.and for tolkien  the main inspiration was the bible. he used other myths to complete his world. he used logic conclusions  like  why is sauron how he is  where is he from  why does he create rings  and not something different  so it s not just made up  there are reasons. that s why people can make conclutions about lotr for things  tolkien didn t explain to much. not like a lot of other stuff like harry potter. yes  it s cool  it s based on something  and there are things like depression and dementors. or spells and latin. but it s far more simple. a lot of things are just created. so it s easier to add something new. a new species  a new spell. new characters. but that s not how tolkien worked. with tolkien  everything is based on a lot of other things  and myths. so if you want to know  for example how trolls look like  you have to look at northern european myths. not for example giants or cyclops. not something more eastern like the yeti. just an example how you could understand and follow tolkien  if you want to know  how something is supposed to be.  but yes  main theme is the bible.
if they want to make it they can but they will be losing money as i won t watch it i have my 4k copy of the original trilogy which i have triple dipped onfirst i bought the extended dvd releases then the extended blu ray releases and when they released the 4k versions i bought them as well
jrr tolkien is who got cs lewis to accept  christianity. cs lewis  one of the great theologians of the modern era.
woke brothers presents lord of the reeeeeeings.
i d be ok with a full silmarillion trilogy.  peter jackson isn t likely to come back for it though.
warner bros  oh man  did you see how much of a failure rings of power was  i bet that s totally because it wasn t woke enough and didn t just retell the story that we told years ago  and totally not because it was less about tolkien s work. i bet we could make a ton of money and laugh at amazon by taking our almost timelessly classic trilogy  made from a timelessly classic book trilogy  and removing everything that made it timeless and classic! who on earth is making these decisions! !
omg!!!  how could you have totally butchered that name !!               great vid!
i m not enthused about new lotr movies.  there are more tolkien stories out there  for sure.  there are even ones that might be worthy of adaptation into movies.  i ll reserve judgment but i m not holding out hope.  if the animated movie is honoring the legacy of tolkien and gives us a truly tolkien story i ll be pleased and impressed.  i expect we re more likely to get trans-people riding unicorns on rainbows  but i m feeling extra cynical today.
i ve never met anyone from this  modern audience   are we sure they exist outside of twitter!
they want you to hate yourself as much as they hate you.
to mess with tolken is to be heretical  going with the warhammer talk
the same amazon that made the massively successful lord off the rings tv show
@gambit771  yup
the 4k versions were disappointing. too much dnr.
i don t think it s going to be a remake. i am pretty sure wb was very clear that they will never remake the trilogy
indeed  modern america is quite diverse  however  that doesn t mean that every film or television project that comes out of the works has to be made to cater to everyone. as there are a variety of film genres  there are a variety of audience types. if studios want to maximize profits on a certain genre  they have to know what audience type to aim for. not to jinx it  but if this upcoming reboot to the lotr series doesn t recognize the more avid fans of the lore  it will probably flop  at least compared to what they would be expecting to earn from it.
wb and embracer group teaming up.
the only way you can add to the classic is if they add more scenes from the books we haven t seen. but they won t. they ll race swap everyone. make sure we now what sex they prefer
hollywood never stop doing remakes.. such a waste.
this is the price we pay for not absolutely loving rings of power. evil really can t create anything new.
nowhere have wb said that they are gonna remake peter jackson s lotr trilogy  they have the same rights that amazon does only for movies instead of tv. they re probably gonna tell new stories from the appendices. and as a bonus they re even talking to peter jackson.
hollywood needs to stop chasing after  modern audiences . i m tired of being left out of the party.
can t wait for some woke c.s. lewis adaptations..
it s really funny the way she can t stop won t stop shoehorning in tomb raider hahaha
if they just re do the original films it will be the most expensive spectacular failure in the history of film making
why don t they get that tolkien is not modern  and that s what made this franchise great for the last 50 years
i wish they d stop destroying everything i love.
as long as american ppl are reliant on entertainment  this will continue.  unless you are prepared to entertain yourself in different ways  you will capitulate.
i think they re confusing  modern audience  with  loud angry twitter minority
the only remake needed is 6 movies based on each book of the lord of the rings as it was written...
times like this i wish they d allow ddos as a legitimate form of protest  civil disobedience
shadow projection. unconsciously reflecting back what happened to them.
so  melonie  what so you think about tomb raider  tolkien said  the lotr is of course fundamentally a religious and catholic work... . so in a sense  messing with it is almost sacrilegious. not literally  but... if you have something that s popular and iconic and also fundamentally christian  they simply must turn it on it s head and shake the goodness out of it  warp it  bowdlerize it  cram in all their modernist crap  gay it up  and turn it into a perverse mockery of it s former self.
she speaking facts no lie. colleges teach these hollywood aspects.
after lawd of dem rangz  rangz of powah  yes let s remake the entire trilogy! what could possibly go wrong
if they re going to do this that means hollywierd is all out of new ideas.
wb studio heads said they are not remaking the original trilogy.
can t wait for a super sauron in tight leather
because modern remakes do so well
20 years ago is still pretty modern to me... besides the modern audience trope is a damn lie.
a completely and utterly tone def move from amazon.
it s not a remake it s warner brothers and newline they are talking to peter jackson and his team it will be fine....and i hope they do sauron making the rings just to give jeff bezos a heart attack.
there are good writers out there  but they vet writers first based on woke ideology  then after that  maybe by experience and skill.
i was joking the other day to someone they might have an ai rewrite on the road to now be a love story between two men.
lord of the rings is timeless because of the nature of middle earth. it doesn t need to be updated. i wish folks would get that.
sounds like modern audiences don t want entertainment  but the opportunity to look at themselves in a mirror.
largely unexplored   uh  no  not really.  has a lot of room for us to make stuff up in.  yeah  that s what they mean. and they ll desecrate it like you said.
no matter what they will turn this into a story about their narrative. tolkien isn t even an afterthought.
insert superman   no   meme.
oh wb... you got a little taste of success with hp  legacy and last of us and you get drunk and jump off the cruise ship. to quote sleepy joe  come on mann!
goes to show how out-of-touch these people are. they think modern audiences don t like old movies  yet i have seen lots of people from today s generation  right here on youtube  watching and reacting to classic films like the original star wars trilogy  the christopher reeve superman movies  the rocky films  the rambo films  etc. and they absolutely loved them!
your cat even looked disgusted in the thumb nail lol
i don t know. i m really interested in that tom bombadill prequel to find out who he slept with to become the character he was in the original trilogy movies.there is virtually nothing they can do to make these films better. even the prospect of all cgi will just make it worse. who even has the acting chops these days to be these characters  are they going to deep fake chistopher lee  de-age ian mckellan  but at least frodo will be a poc now and probably a woman.
they aren t doing a reboot but yeah i m not comfortable with modern hollywood doing any more tolkien content.
nah.  they  ll find some way to turn him into a version of trump.
or they ll turn sauron into a member of an  oppressed  group who s  misunderstood and a victim of social injustice who s not really evil. we made him do it  we need to do better.
@marx bane  like what they did with the second kings man movie
best thing to do is ignore it. the books are still great. the movie trilogy is still great.
no more remakes  leave perfection as is   remakes are dumpster fires
love  that whole hating yourself is the point of the remakes.
to quote frodo  nooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!
expect the worst woke lotr
i don t think anyone has confirmed remakes of the lotr trilogy. it s more likely they ll explore more of the third age. i still have absolutely no faith in them not making absolute garbage  but they can t be stupid enough to remake the greatest trilogy ever made.
happy friday melonie mac!
if when it does come out  remember people--no hate watching! don t give them the views  let alone any money. wait until it gets pirated if you want to torture yourselves.
i like you  but i liked rop.  i hope we get some cool movies.
in fairness  many fans of the books also regard the jackson films as desecration  and as a disrespect to tolkien s books. honestly a woke version of jackson s films doesn t really upset me any more than his original terrible films.
this is just painful...back to drawing! i will just stick with indie stuff and my art. god bless!
the more they try the more they will fail. if they have to learn the hard way then so be it.
i d love for a remake of lotr if it was to follow the books faithfully.
heard this news.  made a note in my diary.   simply says  bugger.
rewatched them all just a couple months ago and they need no reboot. leave the lord of the rings alone.
what really happens is that the story-maker proves a successful  sub-creator . he makes a secondary world which your mind can enter. inside it  what he relates is  true   it accords with the laws of that world. you therefore believe it  while you are  as it were  inside. the moment disbelief arises  the spell is broken  the magic  or rather art  has failed. you are then out in the primary world again  looking at the little abortive secondary world from outside.  j. r. r. tolkien   on fairy-stories
i think we re reading too much into this. but then again rings of power happened soooo ..
the issue for me isn t their desire to virtue signal by color swapping  it s the sheer lack of creative ability to make it make sense. i don t care if there s some random half-black elf running around  but have the ability to explain it. game of thrones had loads of diversity  and no one had an issue with it.
attack  might be the wrong way to describe it. more like   infect and wear as a skin suit .
i read the books as a teenager  i read them as an adult and i read them as an elder.  they are fine reading so leave them alone!
i knew when he said  look to the future   that this won t be good. it will be a woke-infested rape of the author s work.shortly before the release of rop  i read this piece where one of the actors said that  tolkien is for everyone . no! tolkien is tolkien  and it is for everyone who accepts that. rop isn t tolkien at all.
there are no writers anymore only activists.
i feel great in knowing i love myself and know who i am plus i sleep well in know i m not supporting their trash  let it all crash and go up in flames with their narratives. the ones who scream about representation do go out and support these movies or watch the shows..they just want to know they won but destroying what was already good as is  i m so sick of it  i don t want my son looking at anything thank god he likes old shows that didn t have this mess in it. i love lotr as is i don t need a remake at all
they still think twitter reflects the audience
at this point i m opting out of current media altogether. everything that was and still is dear to me is being subverted and turned to shit. classic video game series  d d  magic  warhammer  movies. hell  according to recent news from uk  even classic books are being  corrected to suit modern sensibilities . i just made a mental note in my head that all of the above is complete and finished. if any new ip emerges and proves itself to be worthy of my time - it ll eventually find its way to grab my attention. otherwise - i ve got my stuff safely backed up  stay away from me.
the modern audience pretty much means people that have been mentally and emotionally trashed by tictok and other social media. sure it was an issue before tictok  but it threw everything into overdrive. even the chinese gov admitted to tictok causing mental and emotional issues in people using it before it went international. so they monitor tictok and regulate it to the point tictok in china might as well be a different app. so i m proud to not be a member of the modern audience. because it means my mental and emotional facilities are far better off then members of the  modern audience.
all i ll say is this. they wanted a woke ghostbusters and they made it. it bombed  everyone hated it. if they want to keep losing money let them. we still have the classics.
they can t wright creatively when there are a set of rules saying you have to have a certain amount of diversity ethnically and socially. it hamstrings the writers trying to create a script adhering to all of the nonsense rules they have given themselves. especially when these rules are directly opposed to what was originally visualised.
yes  this is finally the end  say goodbye to intelligent life
from my understanding  and other articles  the producers have claimed  keyword  claimed  that they have no intentions of remaking peter jackson s movies  nor redo the  war for the ring  story  and essentially want to make individual movies about characters like aragorn and such from the time before. i m not going to defend it regardless  because we know how these modern adaptations turn out.
matt stone and trey parker should helm an animated movie or series.in fairness to the rings of power though  their orcs looked way better than the cgi ones in the hobbit series.
told you  ..but its going to be   r   rated they want a game of thrones vibe  so it could be good thing  ..its not going to be a remake its based 3000 years before lor and i know for a fact amazon is not happy about this
this is why ladies and gents  i only watch anime nowadays.
make it a modern comedy. nine friends join together on a quest to keep a wedding ring away from their friend so he doesn t marry his toxic wife. they must travel cross country  on foot because they re all broke  to the mountain doom pawn shop where they ll get the most money for selling it.
the problem with tolkiens work is simply not enough material to create thousands of stories from the books available. tolkien wrote four books which did tell a coherent story. these you can adapt  somehow  to the big screen  which has been done nicely. the other books are not telling a story for movies  these are more  tales of middle earth   mainly to cover the  mythology  concept of middle earth. if you venture outside the hobbit and the lotr stories you have to become  creative  in your own way which apparently ends in disaster  which has been shown. so... leave it alone and search for other literature with more books to draw upon. what about kane from karl edward wagner  or conan  the barbarian  only two movies covered that one  there are plenty more really good stories you can adept to the big screen. there is no need to cover the trilogy again. it has been done in a very good way by peter jackson already. if jackson would have made a shitty job then maybe try a new attempt to do it better. but jackson did a good job so leave it alone. for instance  the third part of the hobbit was not that great imo. in fact i did not like the 3 part a bit. it was silly and why  because jackson had to be  creative  there... for the hobbit has not the  room  to make three movies out of it and jackson  while a good director  has not the genius level imagination of the master  tolkien . jackson got a little bit greedy there and the result was not that great. so... maybe do a better job on that one.
what is common sense now... the world is gone weird for me around 6 years ago. the scary thing is   for me   younger generations will think it s normal...
melanie  you re just off the mark here. they re never gonna stop. with anything. the failure of rop was just the first salvo. tolkien s work  being the pinnacle of high fantasy  the gold standard if you will  is the biggest target of the left in nerd culture. superman  batman  spiderman etc  these are all important  and easier targets  to be sure  but outside of the actual bible  which they ve come for before i.e. noah with russel crow-foightin -raound-tha-werld  and exodus with christian butthole bale   tolkien is the big score. if they can pervert that successfully   like they ve done with so many other things we love  they d consider that a mortal wound to our will  our psyche and culture. and they re almost done. the only things we can do now are to starve them of our money  create our own original things and gatekeep the shit out of them. sure  we should keep an eye on some stuff  keep fighting to take back what s been lost  but simultaneously  we need to make new things. think of it this way  if your house catches on fire and the flames spread too fast for you to put them out  you grab your family members and get out. the fire will eventually go out  but you have to start over. we should keep trying to put these flames out  but if it s too far gone  we save the original versions of our favorite things  get out and make new things. pull a rippaverse.
we don t deserve this. this is like a hate crime against geeks.
nothing about the original trilogy is outdated and required a reboot. it literally has better cgi than most movies today. this is just about making a vegan version for the woke crowd.
lord of the cockrings. thanks  i retreat to jackson s trilogy.
classic books have been altered for the modern audience for a few years now.
@gambit771  yeah  but what i m talking about is the fact that leftoids in uk recently started tearing apart established works like shakespeare  huxley  hobbes or orwell. in some cases entire paragraphs are rewritten  changing its meaning.
yet the official press announcement states that they are doing a remake....which one is correct the claim or the official statement
@nobody s home  i think i misspoke  so please let me clarify  the producers issued a separate announcement where they claimed that they had no intentions of remaking the original trilogy.i meant to imply that the producers are making the claim on an announcement. i did not intend for them to be separate entities.
i will also add if you search  lotr remake   the most recent articles support what i was trying to say earlier  they have claimed that they are not remaking them. if they will actually hold this claim remains to be seen. again  regardless of if they remake them or make spin-offs  i m not interested.
@wes bluemarine  that s fair i guess. however it would not be the first time that producers or press announcements were lies. or that they made conflicting statements. however  as history has shown  the official press announcement is usually the accurate one  while the producers tend to be the ones making inaccurate assertions.
@nobody s home  and that will most likely be the case. thank you for letting me clarify my position  i m absolutely not gonna defend these people for anything
given how woke they are going i suspect the results will be just as bad.
@gambit771  south park has never been woke.
not funny.
@marquez daniel  it s better than what hollywood can make.
now they will change the trilogy  so it fits what they show in the show. but the problem isn t just the ideology. the problem is the jealous grandson aswell.tolkien was genius. fullstop. especially if it s about languages. i am interested in that  and how languages develop in europe. and there is interesting stuff. f.e. where the word  fight  comes from. because there are words like that in german and polish.  fechten  and  fechtowa  . and the thing is  there isn t something like that f.e. in the czech republic. and  fechtowa   is something they seem to use in the north of poland more often. and now i looked up civilizations over 2k years ago  the borders of the celtic tribes  and civilizations who came from them  are exactly the same. for example sweden and norway have roots there  but not finnland. and sweden and norway have words like  fechtowa   for a fight. or  fechten    gefecht . and the celtic tribes were in the north of poland  not in the south  not in the czech republic. so here you have some interesting information how languages and culture develop over thousands of years. and it follows the old borders  not the new ones.and tolkien did something simular. research. but a lot more. language  culture etc. and he used it to create the languages and cultures in lotr. he basically mixed cultures and languages  and let them age. he really worked for lotr. he is genius.and his son was able to understand. ofc tolkien did to much work for a single life. and he changed lotr based on new research. that s one thing what makes lotr so special. why it s fantasy  but it feels so real. why people see a lot of stuff they really can identify with in a fantastic world. it is based on reality  they don t have to change that. they just don t understand. but that s why you have a lot of people from all over the world. and they see lotr. and they see  hey  that s like my culture. the hobbits and beer  i am german  i always have to think  it s like an cliche.elbs. here the first thing that comes into my mind is robin hood. and how people had to train with the bow in england. their language is based on some european languages. it sounds a bit like new greek. and it s based on old greek  latin and other languages.and ofc you have other known elements. the oliphants  and hannibal vs rome. other things are more like ancient persia. other things like the near east during the medieval. or the dwarfs and huge fortesses in the alps. or a lot of myths. and christianity. so tolkiens son had tolkiens research  and was able to understand it  and to figure things out. it wasn t just about the  what  . it was important to understand  how and why. to know the  right version   to close some gaps in the world.but now he is dead  and there is the grandson. a guy growing up with all the fame  with all the love for tolkien  but without doing anything for that. and that during a time  where you have tolkien fans  and they  compete  with him. who knows more  who understands tolkien better i can imagine  he didn t want to learn about lotr. so people lectured him. asked  why he doesn t know. that s embarrassing  and ofc  especially young  it takes away self-confidence. he couldn t see it as motivation to learn. but he gets compared to tolkien. so if you don t want to learn  but you don t want others to know better  because you feel like it s your birth right to know better  you just change it.that s what he does. he said  people should stop to strictly follow tolkien. he had influence at amazon and the lotr rop show.so what he did  is just looking something simple up  that s popular. an ideology. the ideology  amazon  netflix and others  who wanted to buy lotr  support. it s different to tolkien  it s easy to understand. perfect for the jealous grandson. and now he made it about something  where you don t have that much source material to follow. it would have been far easier to make a show about morgoth. but with less source material  you have less to learn  and less that contradicts the ideology. more  freedom  to change. to make up new  facts .so it s about hurt feelings  too. and i think  now  after they made rop  and new  facts   they want to change the trilogy  so it s more like the show. because the show happens before that. and it influences it more than the 1st age. and i can imagine  he hated the trilogy. especially the popular movies. because it s the most known thing. and if he got lectured  for sure it was mainly about the trilogy. and if he wants to know better  but doesn t want to learn  his main goal would be to change the trilogy. irony  that he is a lot like morgoth. but as beta.but hearing about them wanting to reboot the trilogy  and wanting to do it now  i think  that s the reason. because if it s about success and money  imo the best thing would be something about morgoth. but trying to reboot some of the best movies ever  why should you try that  especially if you could do something about morgoth. it would be successful  if they would follow the source material. so imo the only reason isn t just to change it for woke culture. but to change it for the grandson aswell. the goal isn t just to make it more woke  but to make it different to what it is now  because you would have less stuff to get lectured about. so i am worried  because it would be bad enough if they would focus on  necessary  stuff to make it woke. but i feel like they would change a lot more  just to make it different. and ofc if they change something  and need an idea what it should be  they make it woke. so the motivation isn t just making it woke  but changing it. making it woke is the consequence. just concernes  but that s why i am worried  it could be worse than you would expect. because they aren t just people in charge who have the goal to make it woke  but a guy who has the goal to change it as much as possible  aswell. so i expect something really awful. not just gender swapping  but really changing the most fundamental things in the trilogy. maybe even the languages. i don t know. but everything he doesn t know or doesn t like because of his feelings and being jealous about the respect his father and grandfather got and get  and others  who know better
this is going to go one of two ways. 1  peter jackson has listened to tolkein purists like myself and we re going to get something that outshines his original trilogy.2  jackson has listened to the leftists and has remade it for modern audiences.i ll wait and see what other people think before i watch it.
that s the real reason why gandalf said    run you fools!!! .... because the wokes are coming!!!
i really wish everyone in this circle of content creators could come together and boycott the new lotr. i know it s your jobs to watch them  don t this time. send a message with the only thing that these companies actually care about. ignore it  don t talk about it  pretend it doesn t exist. they are banking on you talking about it  which plays right into their hands. let this thing drop into obscurity where it belongs. bash it right up to the point it drops  then talk about something  anything else.
if they want a woke lord of the rings  then make one. don t take a traditional piece of work and corrupt it  just make your own version and own it! give it a new name and say it is like tolkien meets rupaul  maybe call it  queen of the rings .....damn  now i want someone to make that movie
i thought i read that they were looking into other stories besides the one book...
i doubt the can top lotr trilogy  and it s such an easy job  all they need to do is bring lott back to movie theater and it d still sell like crazy.
hard pass on the remake
i don t have any feelings about this. for me there are only the books from tolkien and his son about the lord of the rings universe and the lord of the rings movie trilogy. anything else are just movies with elves and dwarves.
not like they can burn down the wheel of time again
thank god i got the directors cut of jacksons trilogy on dvd  i will not watch anything hollywood puts out
i ve got an idea. people like darker versions of popular ips like the boys  right  well  warhammer is like a darker version of middle earth. leave middle earth on the shelf for a while and make warhammer movies and shows.
at this point hollywood is just trolling
they could have a more racially diverse cast by using one quote from faramir in the two towers   the enemy  his sense of duty was no less than yours...you wonder what his name is  where he comes from...what lies or threats led him on this long march from home  or he would not rather have stayed there in peace   show how these people were mostly good  but seduced by sauron  the great deceiver  go to war. it ll never happen  instead they ll make legolas a woman  have gandalf the black instead of gandalf the white  and have aragorn fall in love with arwen  the son of elrond.
it makes no sense to remake these movies since they are only about 20 years old and people still enjoy them today because they have aged very well. surely they can come up with something new or more original than trying to give us a watered down imitation of something that has already been done and is far superior to anything warner has been putting out in recent years.
i came to watch a movie not myself on the screen!
i ve given this a think about and given how much of a disaster rings of power was  i m fine with it. people will appreciate the novels and the peter jackson trilogy more and warner bros will lose a ton of money  so we all win.
to quote darth vader.   nooooo!
any and all to lotr films and series will most likely be massive raging dumpster fires. tolkien s works deserve to be treated with respect and care. its clear modern film makers and writers only wish to destroy his great works. i can tell you now i will not be watching anything new they put out.... at lest we still have the original 3 peter jackson films and tolkien s novels
tolkien said the lord of the rings was created for britain s to have a mythical and magical fantasy world similar to the greeks and germans.
for the english  he wasn t happy with king arthur and robin hood   not the british.
don t want it!  too bad!  we will mold you woke!!!
we don t need remake for  modern audience  because trilogy we got was already perfect and timeless. i remember watching it when it came out and it was amazing back then  it wasn t just a movie  it was the experience. this is why this  remake  is utterly pointless. you can replicate the story  but you can never replicate the experience.
who wouldn t want  brokeback mount doom
narcissism  the belief that one has a god-given right to live rent-free in everyone s head.
it s going to be a circus of inane  modern american politics that will make the peter jackson ones even more beloved.
surely it can t be a remake. who on earth things the original peter jackson trilogy needs a remake.
honestly at this point i m convinced warner has the downs. first the way they treat people that promote thier content for free.second the way they fubar ed the dcu.third the later seasons of got.now this.
this is like remaking jaws or star wars... you just can t.
40 year old auditions for aragorn  lol boomer get out lol the casting standards of today  whilst preaching diversity  exclusively cast people born 1991-2001. yet another franchise is being handed to 90s zoomers.imagine if they told 40 year old viggo that he was too old to play aragornis there srsly any franchise left not handed to untalented spoilt zoomers
there are classics that doesn t warrant a remake even those in the 80s  are they remaking lotr hoping to get everyone to listen to woke gospel
i mean it can actually be good
nice ink!
hey melonie  just found our channel and it s great. jesus saves.
honestly  i have no hope for this movie  but by the wording i don t think this is a re-make of the lotr trilogy.  i think when they say that the world  he created is largely unexplored they are referencing the other areas of middle earth mentioned but unexplored in the trilogy.  that said it will be so jam packed with woke cannibal trans lesbian pedophiles or some such nonsense that it will be terrible like the rop series. it sucks when the ips you love have a movie announced and it s a hard pass as soon as it s announced.  i wonder why hollyweird didn t learn from top gun maverick that if you pay proper homage to an ip people love and have fond memories of then the people will flock to it.i was watching the new national treasure series and it is like they went through a checklist making that series.  a daca immigrant  an african american  an asian  and a white boy are the main characters.  i mean i like diverse characters when they are well written and fit the story  but when it feels like you literally went through a checklist it s like what the hell.  i mean the formula is crazy daca is the intelligent leader who is constantly scared of being deported  african american computer nerd and a civil protestor  asian dude is smart  white boy is the goofy tag-along.  creativity in hollywood is dead.
this is like when auto makers want to get everyone to buy a brand new car when their existing cars still work great. no  we don t need new editions of lotr. the existing movies still look great and still don t feel or look dated. don t need new ones.
warner bros did not learn from disney doing remakes of their classic movies. they are making it obvious that they were running out of ideas.
remaster the original films  replace the special effects where possible but a remake is stupid. if wbd makes this it s going to be another film or set of films that will show warner  burning millions of dollars.
lotr ii  tom bombadil s revenge
tom cruse is the bolloxs....we need more of his shit !!
next up let s change the  mona lisa  and upgrade it for modern audiences.  this is a joke people.  and remember to drink water.stay safe. take care. have fun.
warner bros  please follow the books! the slightly good news is it is made by new line cinema which made the original lotr movies  i just hope they haven t been infected by the woke virus.
they re literally screwing with a trilogy that s so legendary  it s used in college courses as educational material.tolkien s work is often times considered to be the pinnacle of fantasy and a lot of stories took inspiration from his work.yet  it needs to be remade god i hate hollywood sometimes man.
the resolve is simple  don t endorse  support  or  even give to them.... ever.
that s a clickbait title  they re not remaking lord of the rings. they never said they re remaking lord of the rings. these will be other stories based within middle-earth  of which there s a slew of that tolkien did. now  granted  they might make those woke garbage  but they re not remaking rings...or the hobbit  for that matter. on top of the fact  apparently peter jackson is involved in some ways  which is at least a positive toward it not going the way the amazon show did. he d keep that shit in check.
lack of creativity is due to the newer generations. 100  agree. boomers and gen x had to live through some shit and had to get creative. latter millenials and zoomers rely on technology. they don t rely on their brains and it shows now in 2023. most boomers are retired now  the folks with actual talent and born into a generation when you had to build things.
the quartering looks different today
these weirdos can t leave great content alone. imagine having some originality for once and make a new ip a timeless classic.
just be sure to not even hate watch this  they can t call us all bigots lmao
well if the jackson trilogy is rebooted remade  i m wondering  how much effort they will put in it  to surpass the rings of power in terms of wokeism. i mean  the rings of power set the bar pretty high. to top that  arwen would have to be a transgender hobbit on stilts in a dress originally named walther who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day.
hell yeah! more afro-american elves and dwarves  more diversity  more equality! can i have more strong independent wahmen! fu aragorn! can t wait!
we all know its going to be lord of the woke.
well let s call it now.legolas  androgynous non binary asexual with a tree kink.gimli  gay  power bottom lusting after legolas.aragorn  all powerful black woman cause we can t have a white man rise to power.boromir  keep him a white man but now make him incompetent and hated by everyone.merry  swap to asian woman  remove humour  add boss girl stereotype .pippin  swap to trans lesbian partner of merry.sam   frodo  all the gay!gandalf  black  trans  gay  immigrant woman who hates middle earth.
hey melonie sure most of the  modern audience  shows suck but lets pray for a great tv show of lotr  maybe we could get one.
i ll stick with peter jackson s adaptation and the ones before. anything new will be  woke af!!! i ll never watch it or rop !!!
i pretty much just accepted the fact that modern entertainment in america is dead every american corporation has been completely infested with activists that care only about spreading propaganda down our throats. the only way to fix it is to completely tear the company apart and start over from scratch but that s not happening anytime soon so i ll gladly be spending my money on japanese entertainment as i always have been.
elvish is basically finnish
the craziest thing is they think that just because they are a  modern audience  they all want to see this kind of stuff. majority of the thing s they recreate for the  modern audience  has failed so what is the point  as for those that hate you for believing in the bible reminds me of 2 verses that say in later times what is evil will be called good and what is good will be called evil and the verse that says many will leave the faith for teachings taught by demons.
my brothers  sisters and thems.i see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.a day may come when the courage of cis-white-men fails  when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship  but it is not this day.an hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down  but it is not this day!this day we fight!
peter jackson s trilogy is more than enough! it s the definition of a perfect adaption from j.r.r tolkien s work! as tolkien said  and this is the truth about wokeness   evil cannot create  only corrupt.
don t apologize for talking about faith.  let the holy spirit speak through you!
nobody said anything about re-making the first trilogy. there are many other storylines  even in just the third age  from which to pick and choose material for completely new films.
calling peter jackson s trilogy a perfect adaption is stupid. but it s the best we re ever going to get.
it s the best adaptation of a franchise that and harry potter is the best we have
they should realise that there was something to stories like superman  robin hood  sherlock holmes and lord of the rings that made them classics. if you don t think that then by all means go and produce new original stories and try to out-compete them  we ll probably never hear from you again  but don t steal our beloved characters just to make them into something else to fit in with your world view.
i do not want fantasy  period pieces  historical fiction  etc. remade for modern audiences! the whole point is to enjoy something from a different time and place with different challenges and cultures. i am so disgusted by everything coming out of hollywood and big studios. most of what they release is morally and creatively bankrupt. an affront to art and storytelling.
and i will go back under my rock before losing the last tip bit of my sanity. knock on it when something good is happening
in germany we have a word   bilderst rmer   engl. painting stormers . do not know  whether you guys in the us have an equivalent. it refers to a communist movement in the early 20th century  which attacked and destroyed paintings  sculptures  memorials and other cultural achievements. it happend not only in germany. as the leinists in russia took over  they destroyed hundreds of churches. even the gdr  the german democratic republic  a socialist state founded after 1945 in middle germany  abolished churches  memorials and sculptures. it is part of the left-wing ideology to destroy all culture which is not socialist and shows non-egalitarian motives.
talentless writers being enabled by greedy executives who think people will consume anything they make with the least ammout of effort possible  if they just slap a recognizable brand name on it. nothing new. let them  i say. if anything  seeing them crash and burn  losing millions in the process  is far more entertaining than anything they make.
no these people need to leave lotr tf alone  i can t stand to think what they ll do to a remake
saw the original lotr.  not interested in anything else hollywood does.  on a different subject  the people that just remade deadspace need to remake the 1st 3 tomb raider games.  probably the last chance i ll have to play a good tomb raider game.
everything has to be woke
hollywood  frodo will be played by a super powerful gay woman. sam will be played by a gay black guy who cries  the elves will be trans and the right wing orcs will wear red hats that says  make mordor great again  and the fellowship will fight against oppression and it will be awesome sauce.everyone else  seriously! lay off the drugs  have you not done enough damage already
the  modern audience  doesn t exist.  it s a fictional concept that comes from people trapped in the bubble of gender and sociology studies majors who actually have no idea how the majority of the country  let alone the world  thinks.  if a book series from the 1920 s is still beloved and reread and the movies from over 20 years ago are still loved the world over what exactly do you think you have to add   what other mythical audience are you trying to reach
coming off the heels of rangz of power. talk about striking while the iron is room temperature
i ve written a 7 book series and i m thinking of rewriting it  changing the two homosexual characters into normal people. just out of bloody spite.
if it ain t broken  don t fix it.
i ll be honest i watch the first lord of the rings movie a very long time ago and i just could never get into it so i ve never been a fan of anything lord of the rings related but i know for a fact that the true lord of the rings fans they don t want this crap they would just prefer to go back to the original trilogy because we know with modern audiences you know they re going to ruin lord of the rings and i m not just saying that because i m not a fan of lord of the rings because it s been done countless times with star wars the last of us name just about anything and it s most likely been ruined because of the treatment of modern audiences
these big names like wb and embracer are doing what they can to raise their esg score. it s another wokeness tool companies are using to defy things like merit based hires  sticking to source material  beautiful characters  and keeping lgbt content away from kids etc.
after what happened with amazon it would be really stupid for wb to take a page from amazon book... seeing how wb is bleeding money and they are in a serious debt well...let s see....but as we know it s 2023 smdh!
any new lotr adaptation will be a disaster  simply due to forces opposing traditional values not allowing any faithfull depiction of real middle  earth.
the thumbnail of this video makes me unhappy  could have gone my whole life without imagining or picturing that
tolkien does not need fixing and spruced up as a remake for modern audiences. peter jackson already did that. we don t any more.why don t they go after something that really does need fixing and brought up to date to reflect the modern world we live in today for todays modern audiences  how about birth of a nation  why don t they go after that  i heard that they went heavy on the black face for that movie. fix that.leave tolkiens work and jacksons adaptation of it alone.  it was for the audience of it s time  as much as it is for the audience of today  that is why it has endured so well. it is timeless  there are no fixes or meddling needed.
we all know exactly what the result will be you can practically set your watch to it. remake will be of course super ethically diverse regardless of it making zero sense in the european english setting the story is meant to be set in. characters will be more then likely gender bent with some of them being made randomingly gay. almost no resemblance to the original source material. fans will be blacklisted as racist  sexist  toxic  white supremacy supporting nazis. project will completely flop. writers and producers will strach their heads and ask how this could have happened but ultimately will still blame the audience regardless and move onto the next thing to destroy. rinse and repeat. either way i m not gonna waste my time acknowledging this. majority of the stuff hollywood shits out it s ass nowadays is the equivalent of bad fan-fiction. i already have the original movies and the underrated bbc radio drama. i don t need anything else. certainly not some shitty bastardized reimagining made for some mythical nonexistent  modern audience .
i thought the first two in the reboot were pretty good. lara wasn t a feminist and still needed men like jonah and the prophet in her life.we don t talk about shadow
@razoro2productions  no that you mention it i did like the original reboot.  but the people that remade deadspace did such a great job  i would love to see them remake the original tomb raider.
hollywood already pissed off the tolkien fans with the rop show. i don t think this will be tolerated by the fans.
this video is what happens when you watch enough nerdrotic and critical drinker and make a video using all the same ideas they already put on yt  with millions of views
1 37knock everyone down to their subterranean level
they literally said they won t be remaking the trilogy.
i m so jaded by all the woke garbage that has enveloped almost all of entertainment that going forward anything new must prove to me that it isn t infected with woke-ness.  no more benefit of the doubt.
at the least i could maybe a remastered or cgi updated version  but the original trilogy does not need a remake  unless they want to spread.....the message....
why  we don t need a woke version of every movie made.
like a dog that returns to his vomitis a fool who repeats his folly.  proverbs 26 11
jesus christ  the original trilogy is not even that old. the leftist cult really wants to desecrate it because they know how much we love it.but the sad part is  a lot of people here are still going to give wb money and watch it. then they will go online and complain about it.
the strongly catholic tolkien would not want anything featuring sodomy to have his name on it.the  modern audiance r   as thought of by screenwriters doesn t exist.
instead of remaking just use the money to update the cgi so it looks better
i don t know about blasphemy  but it does feel like a serious lack of respect  and reverence.
like ricky gervais said. lazy and remakes of movies are killing the industry.
well  this was all financed by the same people that watched that god awful spinoff series. so  youtubers that reviewed the episodes also played a role as well.     for as much as people becker about you guys will still spend your money to see just how bad it will be. another win for hollyweird.
there must be tons of tons of feminist literature from the 1960 s. if they want to dump billions making movies from them  be my guest  just understand that fans of non feminist timeless works do not want to see feminist versions of those works.
well  i hope it s insanely expensive.
as the god of war   you have a lot to learn young grasshopper
haha  great. hollywood s folly makes for some great youtube
for decades  progressives have relied upon  and preyed upon  the agreeability of the average american. this country was founded on individual liberty and they have taken advantage of that at every opportunity  allowing their ideology to slowly metastasize throughout the culture. no one wants to be called an -ist or a -phobe  so to avoid such labels  people would just kind of go along with the nonsense  not realizing that the cultural grooming was slowly taking hold. then  in around 2012  when they believed their institutional power was secure  they went mask-off and dialed everything up to 11. and because liberty  as much as the leftist lunatics wish it was not  is still a foundational value in the us  it took around another decade for the people to finally start fighting back.
jrrt was a devout roman catholic. his friendship with cs lewis is why lewis became a believer. he would not approve.
it s your money  warner brothers. go ahead and set it on fire  if that s what you want to do.
everything good in america was built by people of faith  whether christian or otherwise. they believed we had a spark of something better and aspired to live up to it. the abandonment of christianity in your land has given rise to the abandonment of morals  in music  movies  culture as well as dignified peaceful leadership on the world stage  and been replaced by naked  for money  power and control of what others think. hope things get back to normal there sometime soon.
the peter jackson movies were perfect. gimme a break.
zaslav is no different from other leftists  just more aware of the money...who reasonable could think this is a good idea  after seing what happened to rings of power !
can t wait to see representation of all gender and races and inclusive diverse cast lmao.and ofcourse they will put modern politics for reflecting the world that we live in today.i won t watch that abomination
melonie every video i love the way you do your hair in a hopefully non creepy way sorry if it is
i m just waiting for hollywood to make a movie about the whole bible for a modern audience and have gay god and trans jesus parading around. i really do pray things do get better.
what about new willow show vs rings of power what is worse
the woke cannot create  so they destroy. i don t feel guilty  i feel insulted by woke nonsense because it insults my intelligence. any normal person would feel that way  i think. leave this sainted trilogy  pj s trilogy  alone.  rings of power  was bad enough  insulting enough  but this--assuming it even gets off the ground--will be an even more colossal insult to the fans and tolkien s legacy. what  is gandalf going to be a black bi poly pansexual trans woman now ! fuhgeddaboutit. i ll keep my extended dvd s thank you very much. nobody will top pj s love and commitment to authenticity and truth in storytelling. no. bo. dy.
the porn industry often makes knock-off movies of blockbuster hits as well.... that s how i ll start looking at modern hollywood s take on everything. as if it s just x-rated trash that s set for a dumpster fire as soon as it comes out  but definitely not anything related to the original titles...lol! we all just need to do this together and it will work. as a matter of fact   i bet the porn versions will have done better by time all is said and done.
revamping the  lord of the rings  film franchise .....why  when the original peter jackson movies were great  they are trying to fix something that was never broken.
i don t think they should mess with j. r. r. tolkien work it feels like you re trying to turn into star wars. and i very much agree with you on. although you seem like the kind of person that says they re great christian and sweater uses it as a shield. talking from personal experience it s why i left the church because of people like that. that intersect i couldn t believe in a god but would be willing to let my sister burn for all eternity.
lotr has no remakeslotr need no remakes
paul wrote  for we are not as many who corrupt the word of god    that is the proper version from the received texts  textus receptus from the antioch stream of manuscripts    not the corrupt alexandrian egyptian vaticanius versions which means he paul was aware of the corruption of scripture as they were still being written as he was still writing his epistles ! scriptures are the most hijacked bit of information ever! they twist and distort it  create cults  and turn our faith in christs sacrifice into a ritual based control mechanism and then people who dont know the true history scapegoat real christians for the evil things the mock christians do in the  name of christianity god !like the roman catholics burning real christians at the stakes for not accepting  mother church s  bible .. people will say  ignorantly  the  christians used to force their belief on others and kill them..when it was really christians being killed for not accepting a false luciferian version of their faith! any non believers out there consider this  as the bible was being written through the years  other peoples were aware of the scriptures and none wrote any detractions  they could only corrupt what was there and to this day  its the same  they do everything they can to distort  convolute and get the info away from you so you either never believe in scripture as history truth or if you do believe  most end up in a church teaching from a corrupt version that never gives the proper message of salvation!!  which is 1 cor 15 read it believe it  trust in it .so if the bible is just a  fake book of fairy tales .. why so much work through millennia s to keep it from you ! hmmmedit  i could go on and on and about certain institutions hiding artifacts  temples  lying about  rock carved temples etc etc..this is why i have no more friends to game with online xd!
you guys can also try to not be mean toward modern audience and try to be nice to woke people as well because why not xd what could go wrong after all  let them modernize everything we known and love
warner brothers just keeps messing everything up.
tolkien was a  man of faith  but the lord of the rings is almost entirely pagan.
melonie  you should play the new game atomic heart!
oh dear gawd no!!!! no! noooooo!!!  - no one
warner likes to lose money i see
not creepy at all  thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  glad it isn t and thanks for replying to my comment
who are these  modern audiences  because they certainly aren t buying cinema tickets.
i ve got an idea! the woke people are the orcs  the ring is the iphone and mordor is twitter lol
i looked into my palantir and it showed me an increase in americans watching older films and series and or watching foreign media.
i m filled with dread.
mainstream entertainment is just a giant facepalm these days.
and sauron they them  fashioned the one ball gag to rule them all
leave everything alone  hollywood!
go ahead warner brothers. spend as much as you want on making these movies. 1 question though. who is going to pay actual money to see it  what s the business plan here
hope they wont suck like velma  they are made by warner who made velma  no high expectations
i love your tattoos melonie
blasphemy is the right word  look what they did to a wrinkle in time too!
ugh   they already altered the stories for the full trilogies   and granted  not necessarily in a bad way  though i still miss tom bombadil  but damn  why   you know theyre gonna ruin it!  rings of power  a debacle on the level of the shannara series  shouldve been their indicator to stop there.  but nooooo   btw not sure if you re into this stuff  but it does kinda touch on what hollywood is doing  at the behest of greater powers https   youtu.be fsx7eskldtm
you speak my mind.
i support this video
i was accused of being a  bad christian  until i showed them how bad they are
rings of power and lord of the rings should stay true to the original info and stories and leave wokeness out
funny   not funny thought..  we re heading for  majority rule   the orville s1e7  if things keep on the current tracks..
modern audience  is a curse.
it sounds like they re very eager to produce unpleasantly bizarre films people won t want to watch.
you dont understand that they defile the classics to bother you.
i say let them bastardize these franchises and bankrupt themselves go woke go broke.
warner bros. embraces hell and will complain when the heat gets a bit beyond  warm .  sit back and enjoy their fall.  do not throw them a rope.  they ve spit in your face more than enough.
let them try. they wont make it past part 2. it ll be such a disaster they wont be able to complete the project
why remake a movie that still looks better then everything released these days  except for maybe avatar but i haven t seen that yet
the title   lord of the rings broke back hobbit  staring bree larson an amber heard. one ring to stop the opression
anther disaster on its way
they re gonna make all the orcs trans and saruman drag. i can see it now.
it s bad enough when i get on xbox  i m constantly seeing ole micropoop keep adding in woke ads and menu items  ads i can at least say i don t want to see more of and they do it again in a few months but can t get rid of the menu items sadly. i think we should have the ability to choose what we see  and since i pay yearly since my military days and even prior - 20 years now - they should just leave me alone with ads and stupid things i don t want to see.
limited run games belongs to embracer  so...
pissing on tolkien s grave.
warner brothers announces  it s setting fire to dumpsters full of cash to make movies no one will watch.
that thumbnail ....you know its gonna happen. cant make good original movies gotta do remakes.
let them make it  just don t see it.
i can just see some idiot at warner brothers suggesting that either j.j. abrams or rian johnson would be a good choice to direct these new movies.
@3 30 am i wrong or should rohirrim be pronounced  row-hear-um
if they ruin legolas one of my favorite elves and favorite character in the lord of the rings franchise i will no longer support warner discovery
oh joy.  sarcasm a remake for 1.6 percent of the population.
modern filmmakers just can t come up with their own ideas  so they ruin classics.
i hope this isnt happening
they must be incredibly stupid for them not to learn anything from past events.
i really wish content creators didnt misrep so much it makes them look stupid..... the word remakes was never used in the call the statement was new lotr movies in the works
then might as well change the name to lord of the rings  fellowship of the cock ring  wait does that already exists  i m kinda worried to find out.
hard pass  no pun intended
wb also announced remakes of the harry potter movies...
witch king   no man can kill me. eowyn   i am no man. or woman. i m a non-binary otherkin. my pronouns are they them .
let them do what they do. fans just need to respond with your wallet if you don t like it don t go and see it.
evil cannot create anything new  it can only destroy that which good hath wrought.  it s like tolkien saw this crap coming.
they can stick a new version of lotr really not interested they will trash it with woke. and i m a massive tolkien fan
ratio will not be enough for this...
i ve been sick of hollywood rebooting classics. why can t they create something new or adapt things into movies that have not been filmed
it s not gonna be remakes tho...it s gonna be new movies
they are obviously making money by doing this or else they would have stopped
hahaha! they just can t help themselves.
this girl is cute but if my gf had this girls voice  i d be single
i hope this is a lesson for na people gate keep the hobby you love because this is what happens you have these old ass ceo s thinking they catering to the fans because of woke nonsense
i m probably not going to see this. i m done with these companies.
it s peter jackson i prefer him over anyone else
i bet it will be called  they them of the cock rings
stop before you do anything   don t make some mistake like rings of power.if they dare bastardise  this holy films even little bit you make yourself my mortal enemy!!!!
my favorite gorgeous curly haired og tomb raider fan vlog gal.
then why does the official press release call it a remake
@nobody s home  what official press release  the variety article  they re not remaking the trilogy  people are just assuming it.
@nobody s home  i just read the warner bros press release and nowhere in it does it say they re remaking the trilogy. from the earnings call and the press release they made it pretty clear that these will be new movies.
i say let them remake all the ip s.  the bigger they spend their production cost the better  that way the bigger they run out of money when no one watches it.
those modern  writers  can t understand why the movies suck and do badly at the box office. it must be the evil patriarchy. the audience hasn t changed as much as they would like to think. if it had  these woke movies and tv shows would have better ratings.
oh ffs...why  leave lotr alone!!
i m proud to say i ve never given my money to a bully not in school and certainly not now
more like fellowship of the rim.
can they please stop destroying my favourite story
making a lord of the rings remaker is  dumbest thing ever!
to me  if they want to make films for  their audience. then  come up with an orginal idea  with a good story that supports the characters   and why they are diverse. instead they are just hijacking  these franchises. and inserting wokeness  into franchises  shows and movies that no one asked for.
lord of the rings doesn t need to be remade.
why tf do they keep doing this
there s no more talent in the cinema industry. these woke companies can only make garbage reboots and cannot come up with an original idea if they all rubbed their combined braincells together.
if peter jackson is not involved in this in someway i do not care about the remake with 90  cgi i ll take the og instead
if your people can t make new  get new people
probably trying to hold onto the rights...
when people state  it doesn t reflect modern audience   please write in text  what exactly does nobility  tradition and fraternity not fit with  modern audience
omg they will not it can t be real
yes  warner bros  don t learn from the last  100 million abortion and piss away even more money.
the acronym you are looking for is fubar.
i disagree  bring on new lord of the rings. oh hell yeah!!!
hugs and bacon  hope ur having a great day sis  and  i m done with everything at this point   this is y i pirate everything  and even then i sometimes don t even bother
hugs and bacon are the recipe to happiness  thank you!
yep.  not touching anything that warner brothers does to lord of the rings.  i don t trust modern hollywood going anywhere near tolkien s works.
it ll be perfectly modernized in every way. i look forward to 1. sam and frodo being gay and in a relationship. 2. pippen will be female3. merry will be trans and in a relationship with pippen.4. aragorn will be a soy boy who can do anything on his own. 5. arwen will be a girl boss who leads the fellowship and bosses aragorn around because he s worthless. she ll be right about everything and better at magic than gandalf and a better sword fighter than everyone. 6. gandalf will use they them pronouns.7. sauron will be a straight white man and orcs will be  white washed . 8. saruman will be right  but misunderstood. 9. rohan will be ethnically black.10. gondor will look like modern day nyc with female knight in charge. perfectly diverse in everyway. 11. the ents will be gender neutral or female and looking for ent husbands. 12. the ring wraith will become a mix of male and female with various body types. 13. all the elves and dwarves will be ethically diverse. 14. gimli and legolas will be form a relationship and one will become trans as the movie progresses.15. arwen will explain  as the new queen boss of gondor  why they are implementing socialism  destroying patriarchies everywhere.
rofl this is a tragedy.
i d be mad  but i m never watching it...the industry is poisoned.
get woke  go broke!
smegal is going to be non bianary
what is a modern audience  15 year olds  because anyone over 30 is not a  modern audience . they are the audience the original movies were made for.
no no no. let them make it  lose money  and lose relevance. we have our physical copies of the originals. if you don t  go out now and get them  before they change it or axe it.
the originals aren t even that old and have aged well. there s no practical reason to remake them. this is just a waste of time.
the tumblr and twitter fanfic freaks are taking over
this is not going to go well at all.
where does it say remakes
they can shove their modern audience crap. it blows i m saying it blows.
damn  and i just held up a v for victory..... whelp....never....count your chickens....nice shyrt
modern remakes  save that for 40-50 year old movies not movies that arent even old enough to drink.
they definitely going to make frodo and sam gay the modern world let alone leftists can t understand 2 men deeply loving each other outside a romantic or sexual context
the hollywood blockbuster creativity from the last 20 years was  lets copy any elements  characters  styles  ideas  fights etc. from naruto  shippuden    co. but make them with western styles   with us comics ..... now that theyre running out of ideas  they are falling flat
im sure they know that rings of power was trash but they dont care
not what i m hearing   the two trilogies are being left alone. just new films  you re twisting it.have  ou watched the animated films.
you clickbaited me with the cat in the thumbnail
if it s better than rings if power they already win but it needs to be better than amazon and the faithful or care of at least the hobbit
wheee i can t wait to see frodo and sam make out with each other!
if woke people want everything to reflect the modern audience why don t they just sit in front of a mirror  and leave movies and tv shows alone!
how mutch money did they need to lose bevore they get it
the remake is gnnabe called lord of the woke and the first scene is gonna b the council debating on what to do with strong pronouns on pronoun to rule them all.
everybody who does not want them to do this should just not see it. don t spend any money on it regardless of the reviews. i don t care if they remake this fantastic who cares it s already been done. if we keep spending money on the remakes  remakesis all we re gonna get regardless of politics .do not hate watch. hate  watching is just supporting.
yeah  the original trilogy will always hold up. the books will always hold up. and these people do not want to make good films. they actively want to destroy everything that s good. that s why everything is getting destroyed now.
nobody wants  lord of the wieners  or samantha gamgee  homo baggins  or maryanne and pippa
and... if they want something  new   it has become some kind of a fetish  why the heck they do not invent something  new  themselves  it doesn t make any sense to want something for the modern audience and then take a story decades of years old. i know why they do it. because it has already a huge fan base and is known around the world. but... the fans do like the story how it was told. and what they don t understand  in particular the fans are mostly hardcore lovers of the original story  they do not want the story to be changed a bit.
oh no! please no!!!
i am so disappointed after rop. i hope people get enthusiastic with the books since hollywood and media are shit.
so it s going to get the modern audiences treatment   butt sex and bad jokes   writing done by some tumblr rando from the shipping siblings forum   yeah  hard pass for me.
so uh... we re getting a gay gender swapped gandalf now
i wish hollywood would just stop remaking old movies. for god sake hollywood do something original and popular for a change.
cant wait to see gimli and legolas be gay for each other.  s.
...blackrock is funding woke...
sorry  but it s row-here-um. other than that
obviously  aragorn was always intended to be transgender and legolas was written as a black lesbian woman.
it needs to be better than the jackson movies to justify its existence... it won t be.
@special k  they would need to copy the books descriptions word for word to make even good because the bar is so high unless it s not lotr but in the tolkein universe they would need to above and beyond for this to be good because peter jackson set the bar even the hobbit as bad as sone part are still good just company pushing
oh god nooooooo
oh sam....
oh  hell  no!  do not want this!!  won t pay for this!!
clickbait thumbnail but good video
because the series was so well recieved    don t.
here they come to fully ruin lotr
oh hell no!
oh fffffffffffffuck that. the movies are already perfect. there is no reason whatsoever to remake those.
@melonie mac go boomwhen ceo s are members   invitees of the kssngr assoc.-atlantic cncl. s wef  expect the message to always be more important than      period.
love lotr and hobbit movies! nobody i know watched rings of power and doubtful they will watch any new commi lotr from a woke garbage company.
i guess nobody has learned anything from watching amazon chuck a billion dollars into the toilet. so be it. no skin off my teeth.
warner bros. chiefs michael de luca and pam abdy already said they aren t even interested in doing a remake of the lotr trilogy. get over it.
i am a straight white male  i am not giving in to this garbage great reset. nice video.
hey your clothes match your color theme in twitter. was that intentional
cant they just make their own degenerate movies show and leave our favorite shows alone
if the woke it even in the slightest i wont watch it.
woke for modern audiences  entertainment  can be looked at as films books television etc. that doesn t exist.just like old out of date reference books maps etc. have no value anymore except to cultural sholars.we can t erase them but we can ignore them.
time to check out of this woke asylum
the minute they say for a modern audience its  d. o. a. sorry to say its guys
screw it. let them go broke so we can laugh.
she loves black and yellow  lol. go steelers
but no one says they re making it for modern audiences also the title is blatantly false
can t wait to not watch lords of the woke
i don t know  but i heard they are killing off the tmnt for a female reboot
this new lotr is going suck so hard.
modern audiences is woke for  let s make everyone gay and or trans.
leave lord of the rings alone stop freaking changing thingsto destroy everything we love
oh my dear lord  no  please no
now that s just stupid no reason for a remake
well if they make them chicks
... oh  absolutely not.
this is a really bad idea. . . . .
nothing is sacred to these people
confirmed  gandalf is a trans black woman in the remakes
well i don t know if you heard but woke strike back again the show wednesday season two they re going to put the alphabet in it wednesday supposedly supposed to be a lesbian what else is new
sadly  it s because most women fall for the guilt trip.
ayoo the thumnbail  he s married  pretty sure that what i remember
i don t care about any  ideology   the movie industry doesn t give one damn about  ideology  unless it makes them money  that s all. its just cash grab  that s all.
well  they can do whatever they want. we re safe with the trilogy we got  and i highly doubt it ll ever be successful. recent movies have been showing that being woke isn t helping. let them lose money.
this is such a bad idea on behalf of wb. would have been epic though if they basically made a silmarillion movie or set of movies to shit on amazon s blasphemous rings of power bull shit.
it s good to see wb self implode
remake  remake  reboot  remake  remake  reboot. i m getting a bit tired of the remakes of previous successes  as the remakes and reboots are never  well almost never  as good as that which they are attempting to copy.there are literally billions of books and stories to create movies and shows from. let s get some of those made instead of remaking or rebooting things without the foresight  passion and or integrity of the original.
can t wait to not see it.
i honestly wish peter jackson would make an elder scrolls movie trilogy without the woke stuff.
flat earth  the round version
speak with ur wallets guys...... dont give them any of ur hard earned money.....i refuse to buy tickets and i hope all these companies go dowb in flames for wrecking everything
they ve ran out of ideas so they just do remakes
smh
...creatively bankrupt...
do yourselves a favor and buy physical copies of the movies now before its too late.
we should just boycott all the new lotr movies
a lot of speculation in this video  and according to gamespot  it is clear that movies will not be remakes or tread over already explored areas of middle earth
sorry mel  fake news. they ve explicitly stated that they re not making movies of anything that s already been covered. everyone needs to take a breath lol.
before i outright just don t care about this  i have to ask is peter jackson and co in anyway involved  even producing at least if not i m out.
you still didn t gave up on hollywood  in my opinion it simply doesn t exist anymore. i ll go read the books now.
lotr doesn t reflect a modern audience...  well  duh. it s not supposed to. warner brothers is gonna get wrecked.
i don t even care anymore. it s not like that woke crap sells like hot cakes or anything. let them burn their money  we can still enjoy our classics - just make sure you got some copies at home because those streaming versions can and will be changed as we know by now.
the lotr trilogy has no remake. the lotr trilogy needs no remake.
creativity is dead. all we can do these days is take older proven concepts and destroy them. nothing is new  everything is a bad woke rehash...
nooooooo for the love of god leave lotr alone the rings of power is proof that hollywoke can t do it justice.
a woke version of lotr   let me say that in german   ich kotz gleich im strahl!
where is cole-train  you had him in the thumbnail picture  but not in this video  where is the kitteh ! !
when nerdrotic had mentioned it was going to get worse  before it gets better.  i had hoped this was not going to happen.  this  plague  needs to be eradicated.  leave tolkien s work alone.  go make your own shit!
fordo sam meme s cometh
ah fuck!
please oh god oh man please dont remake lotr!!!
neat
black trans frodo with rainbow hair and a nose ring omegalul
make lotr games  comics  animated series. leave live action alone.
lets  go boom  they are just catering to the woke pockets and don t wat to just make nea things  they want to piggyback off classics because thats the only way for them to back any money off these crappy movies.
what!
oh no please stop the madness please stop the horror  i can not take this sad horrible news anymore . anyway i hope they will not make lord of the rings remake bc it will just take a big nose dive to devil s home  hell  if it comes out on amazon prime or netflix or any other networks stations. anyway i will not watch it ever if it comes out and i just want to say that warner brothers need to make a some other great shows to air on networks station   leave the lord of rings remake in the garbage for good forever. anyway i just wanted to make a comment on this video for today and i just want to tell you that you did a great job with the interview with alex stein and dean cain last night  thursday  on alex streaming show  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie   have a great weekend too.
watch their going to make kratos gay
writers  we need to insert more people of color in this clearly white time period  for some diversity.also writers  diversity  what diversity  black panther is pretty much exclusively black  deal with it!funny how that only works in one direction.
a giant asteroid cannot crash into earth soon enough.
i want to see your cat
woke rings of no power !
nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
i m not watching this. they dont have it in them to make good lord of the rings. or anything else for that matter.
hollywood needs to stop pandering. if you don t like a story or don t feel represented or whatever  then it obviously wasn t made for you. not everything has to be. also  the lotr movies were masterpieces  leave them alone!
oh no...
just a small one would do  centered on hollywood.  p
no one trusts hollyweird anymore. not for a long time...
ugh  leave our classics alone.
noooooo
oh great

noooooooo
modern  trash remake   this is going to be  broke back hobbit the one ring edition
algorithm.
okay  trop didn t work out as intended. so let s pile on more crap  surely this time it ll work
please no!
all white barbershop remake  make it happen hollywood!
warner brothers is dying they need a hit. the only thing they need to do is take the old script and find great actors. i don t have high hopes. they need to prove me wrong before i get hope. if they only remaster the old once they would get milions easy.
no  no  and no again!!that s like saying i m going to reboot the original star wars trilogy .somethings non-starters. either someone at studio is arrogant or completely clueless  or a horrible combination of both
the thing that gets me is that there is a reason why pre 2010 they never included this stuff in movies and tv shows...people do not want to watch it. this is the thing the left does not get. people still do not want to watch it.  nothing has changed  literally. hollywood has always been super left  they really wanted to put gay characters and minorities in stuff  even going back to the 1970 s.  the modern left thinks hollywood did not because they were the ones refusing to do it because hollywood was prejudiced. they were not  they just knew people would not watch it and were sane enough back then to know that.the only difference between the shows and movies people loved back then  and still do today  and today  is hollywood is actually run by the people the left wants that will put in woke indoctrination into everything despite them knowing no one wants to see it. they are not driven by profits anymore. they are ideologues.
leave lord of the rings alone!!!!!
you have to have common since to use common since. these people don t have it.
hollywood needs to take  a page from nintendo s book  and stop caring about stupid things. i can understand  what you mean when you feel sad  the legend of zelda majoras mask taught me one thing while playing it  and that is  respect the dead and their wishes so they can rest.
it has not been long since the last damn movies came out. this is the most ridiculous crap ever.

lmao manipulated in to promotion.
she s wrong tho  they re not remaking the original trilogy
when did nintendo completely change their entire way of thinking
@gambit771  they never did and thats what im stating here.
how you saying  rohirrim
no  no  no  no  no  no!  no!  no!  no!  no!  no! nooooooooooooh!!!!!!!
nope i wont go like this movies all shaite  forsomeone saying i nead to  change my mind  i can say that i newer will like this movies for modern folks
no. no. nononononononono! no!
nope. boycott it now.
hey melonie you are not a bad  christian.i m from japan and i am not a bad shinto sme.did you know that j.r.r  tolkien contributed to a bible translation  the jerusalem bible  which came out in 1966..
jesus christ this is gonna be so bad! ring of power was so bad i literally only made it 30 minutes into the first episode. before i wanted to end my subscription to life  kurt cobain style.
warner games did good with hogwarts legacy. why not make a lotr game as well  noooo... they wanna make another woke movie after ruining matrix with matrix 4. cancer!
the original movies are mint and the hobbit they are ruining everything lol thank god we have the classic versions i ll awlways love lotr and and scooby do nobody what they do to the newer versions
wrong  woke lord of the ring is dead zaslav is not going to put up with that you are complaining about amazon not warner brothers
hollywonkers..
please no thank you
and here comes another abomination.
not a chance that this would be anywhere a decent film. they d make woke bs which would fail and then they d wheel out the sexism  racism stuff.
i not excited for these. it will either be quite good are trash. i don t think will have much in-between   going to be funny when it comes out and bombs
i truly despise the modern western world.
be frank with you  i loathe the idea of remaking the lord of the rings movies. i wouldn t mind remaking the hobbit movies  however  so long as they aren t woke.
ladyboy hobbits
can t spell diversity hire without  shire
they re ready to destroy another classic... god help us. i can t wait for vast armies of black elves   asian dwarfs  and gay gandalf.
or  shite .
smh
the blood sweat and tears those men and women put into that marathon they went through to make those original trilogy... seriously  someone thinks they can do better ! get bent.... tolkien s stuff being desecrated feels blasphomey because so much owes those books for inspiration in so much other media and entertainment. tolkien not only has rings fans but also just basic d d fans too. lol and every other fantasy role playing game.
no one asked for a lord of the rings remake.
hell no
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.
whatever. they can do what they want  i just won t watch it or recognize it as lotr. it s like disney star wars or modern star trek.
or- and here s a thought  just read the written canon. you don t need to watch it. even jackson s films were desecrations of the texts as the films progressed  starting with fellowship  which was fairly faithful up until the arwen character was introduced. read the books. these won t diminish- or try the philip dragash dramatic reading of the text. just stop watching this crap.
we all know it will have lgbtq representation   no point in hoping
i don t see the right telling us we should be christian or else
yea  make no mistake about it. frodo  gandalf  aragorn  gollum  and especially any and all balrogs.......gay or  trans .
are the orcs trans though
i wish people were normal
we. will. not. watch. this. woke. remake!!!!!!!!!!!!      warner bros.   do not do this.
its catering for the minority the people that dont pay for movies seems dumb.
lol  wow. they don t learn do they i m not going to watch that crap.
why is the thumbnail frodo and sam kissing  i agree with melonie on mostly everything but gaslighting some of these things before they re released and making everyone angry by showing frodo and sam kiss on the thumbnail is promoting what she advocates against. quick to assume something and capitalize on outrage culture. just because something is getting remade doesn t mean it s another full-on bros movie.
let s see   frodo will be trans  the ring wraiths will be overweight  gollum will be non- binary  aragon will be race swapped  merri and pippen will be groomers and everyone will have colored hair. ugh
i sure as hell won t watch it. and i don t see why normal rational people would watch it
ever since christopher tolkien passed away  may he rest in peace in the halls of mandos until the second music  hollywoke has been frothing at the mouth to ursurp what his father created  and what he spent his life building upon  to inject their bullshit and push their agenda. it is a disgusting display of disrespect.
you can be if you really work at it.
i mean its clickbait but also it wouldnt be surprising if they went that route either because typically modern reboots remake always try to erase what made the originals good and replace it with shitty woke propaganda
@anti-bs  agree remakes are hit-or-miss but the newer spider-man  matrix  tomb raider movies weren t all of a sudden gay. joel isn t suddenly gay in tlou hbo show. i just feel like melonie is just reaching now saying every up and coming new movie show will automatically be woke.
they need to stop doing this garbage
modern audience means gay
nono no no
saaaaaaaaaaammmmmm!
gaylord of the rings written through the lense of feminism
i ll watch a lotr remake under one condition...elon musk plays elrond.
take my advice and buy the blurays of both lotr and the hobbit as soon as you can before this garbage comes out and those versions somehow disappear or are  altered . i fear that when this crap gets released those movies will start to fade from shelves as it were and not be available anymore in an attempt to boost sales of this trash from people who might not know better.
as long as it s good. man idgaf. but tbh the rings of power writing is so dogshit.
why is it with just about anything new  conservatives always crap themselves
they should recast frodo as a trans.  do it amazon.  i dare you.
can t say i am surprised by this. there is no way the original will be topped. i don t need some made for a modern audience gen z riddled mess of a movie. from netflix  amazon to hollywood  so many classics have been ruined because they have zero respect for the source material. just more stuff for me to ignore.
ofc it ll be woke trash. calling it now. every third character is black  multiple trans elves  a crapton of gay hobbits  and the protagonist is a badass girlboss tm  with an activist haircut.
doa
peter jacksons trilogy can not really be done better  don t see the reason for reshooting this. it s not like it was done in the 1950s in black and white with crappy special effects. the books and films are timeless. completely pointless
ohhhh please don t nooooo not peter jacksons lord of the rings...     they certainly will bring more gay stuff   even more black peoples into the project   not that there s annything wrong with that at all     whyyyyyyyyyy  were talking about the middle ages where everybody was gay   black anyway.......      not that there is anything wrong with that
reboots suck worst then a plugged up hoover vacuum.
okay  enough praising of  popular  james gunn.  there is no way he is not aeary of this.  so much for the floating theories out there  that he care about fans and wants to fix warner brothers and dc through discovery.  he is a gay man and puts the lgbtq agenda over the entertainment needs of fans and keeping honored classics like lord rings pure and untainted.  it s about the social engineering message over good movie content
we do not want this yet there it is right in your thumbnail. why would you even advertise trash like that  totally unnecessary and a disgusting picture. you should consider changing the thumbnail. make your point some other way.
stop! it s already deaaad!
hollyweird you ruined wheel of time and star wars.... leave alone lotr unless you wish to have boycotts afterwards ask disney and amazon
lol  that would be so bad it is funny but would it make elrond more incomprehensible and useless than rop or less
no one says they re making a remake of the trilogy
@marquez daniel  i didn t say that either. i just don t expect to get something at the level of the originals.
i meant to say aware.  james gunn is aware of this and shares the blame
@luke yznaga  yeah  he is no saint or savior.
european high fantasy doesn t reflect modern los angeles  literally unwatchable
gay agenda is supreme.  no thinks.
to late!!! they already ruin the lotrs which is very sad there is so much source material to create such good works that they refuse to do because they wanna be woke or political correct. i would recommend forget about anything good coming out for awhile until this woke culture disappears forever.
ask an enginehollywonkersmnthnvnrfnvncknr
more woke shit    no thanks wb.
warner brothers.....if you try bringing more of your woke gay diversity bullshit into lotr we will  close you down for good.
i like how the woke mess up stuff that i hated from the start. lord of the  rings sucked then and will sucks again. 2 times suck fest. instead of making brand new non woke original ideas.
well know what it will look like. entire movie will be green screen and have the bad cgi rubber people  diversity up the wazoo  and remade for the modern audience of today bet we see black orcs and lgbtq orcs
esg
disgusting! this is like rewriting the bible
cat
remake lord of the rings....lol. no thank you. we saw what your vision of the lord of the rings was with the amazon bullshit and no one wants that.
no thanks
why  they can t possibly improve on the peter jackson trilogy. this will be bad. it s gonna be gay  black elves as far as the eye can see with no substance.
making the majority of all media released include lgbtq themes is a massive over correction. if your telling a story about a time and place where it was 99  black people  and you force a gay white man or a trans asian into it  how the fu k does this even make sense  your ruining the believability of your story automatically. forcing people to participate in other peoples personal problems and delusions is what makes them angry  not the fact that your gay  or a man who feels like a woman or any other bs. nobody likes to be forced to do anything  especially from some of the most  inclusive  groups of people on the planet. you want to align with every letter in the alphabet until they dont agree with 100 of your nonsense
what s that  you learned nothing from the colossal failure that was rings of power  you get no support or sympathy from me
tolkien was a christian. how about leave his masterpiece alone.  maybe get original and make your own original piece of work  and do whatever you want with it.  stop trashing the hard work of others for your own petty agendas.
ewww disgsting
tomb raider shouldn t be destroyed or desecrated
i have an announcement  the woke have found you melanie. your channel doesn t have any tall black man representation. i will be the new host of melanie go bam! it s going to be a modernized.... jk!
just stop already! make up your own stories rather than mutilating other people s work!
she blabbers on and on lol is she ok  also although the new tomb raider isn t anything like the old ones i m still not surprised they rebooted it. it was a dying franchise.
