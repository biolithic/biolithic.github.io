yes melonie... constantine is one of my all time favorite movies.  even before I was born again in Christ  this film resonated with me.  probably because it depicts the constant battle between good and evil so well. 

as Christians  we know there's light and dark  angels and demons  fallen angels   and we know God has a plan to win in the end. plus  tolkien  and c.s. lewis to a point  wrote fiction that could be dark.

thank God for this channel. one of my favorites. you are amazing mel!
