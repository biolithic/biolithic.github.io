disney isn t too big to fail. most corporations are doing an about face when it comes to being woke. for some  the damage is already done.
disney  wait!   you mean painting the majority of our audience as  villains  and  trolls  while pandering to a smaller section of the population isn t a good move financially   shock
like i ve said before and i ll say again  choices and actions have consequences. and it looks like disney is finally gonna have those consequences
disney  circa 1990s. the animation  the story telling. study it  channel it.this is their only shot at redemption.
50 percent representation for 1.5 percent of the population.   seems legit
disney went broke and got woke. and the funniest part is that the idiot that set them on this path was brought back to try to dig them out of the hole he made in the first place. disney is getting exactly what it deserves. esg money won t save you
i hope they do or at least they wake up. they should have never removed tim allen in the first place. good job melonie
disney has been destroying everything they touch for a long time now. hope you re having a great day melonie  and have a great time on drinkers stream today
the thing that concerns me is that these people aren t learning. they inject more wokeness into their content  things get worse  and they keep doing it. surely there comes a time where they need to stop pretending and acknowledge their failing brand.
if i was tim allen i would charge disney to the max if they wanted me back
i have always been a disney fan but i can honestly tell you if walt disney was alive today and saw what disney land has become he would dismantle and take down every single park on this planet....what that place has become is a insult to everything that man stands for.
notice how quickly hogwarts legacy has more than gone beyond and overshadowed forspoken
a coworker posted in our team chat how an elderly customer was talking about how woke everything is and someone earlier  posted a gif of a woman from the movie bros  with a caption good morning. i was going say go woke go broke and bring up movies and companies losing money because they are woke. but  since we have a transwoman and my supervisor talks highly about her wife and takes slight jabs at men and some of the other female coworkers snide remarks one day about men  i zip my lip. even my supervisor s  masculine wife got injured at a construction site for mishandling a jack hammer that she was on her tippy toes using it that dislodged her shoulder. i just stay quiet. not going to stay there long anyways.
when you prioritize politics and quantity over quality you kind of end up in this situation   you did to yerself
what s this   a company trying to force unlikable and unwanted content down viewers  throats   and they re going broke   what   how did that happen
blackrock created a system called esg  which is a social credit score system. it s basically a way to keep corporations in line and following agendas that blackrock want s followed. so the way it works is  lets say disney wants to make a movie. well the only way they can keep getting advertisers to pay them to put their products in the disney movie  is if disney has a good esg score. so if they make content that we want  their score will drop and eventually they won t get any money. so the only way to combat this issue is to fill your creative team with a bunch of people who will boost your esg score  hence the podophiles at disney pushing for turning your kids strange . then they just pray that you ll watch their movie and it makes money regardless. that s pretty much the model for hollywood at the moment. are there people who support this woke crap in the movie industry  you better believe there are  i have to deal with some and it s all about making sure not to just keep the conversation moving along so you can keep walking. but are there people who can t stand this stuff and secretly just want to make good movies  and not have to pander to this esg system  absolutely  i d argue that s the majority of people. but the  key people  who get selected  are selected because they ll adhere to the esg format. so all you see are the radicals and their crazy woke crap. until esg is gone  this is what will continue to happen. because there is zero advertising money or funding for a movie if you have an esg score that s low. so it becomes  either you make your movie woke  or you don t make your movie at all.
couldn t agree more. like so many nowadays they are confused on their identity. they are a children s brand  as such you don t put sexual content of any kind in content for kids. you can teach them to not be mean without putting sexual and sexual orientation content in your shows!  they have been dumb and are getting their due. get woke  go broke!
we must strongly oppose these groomers.
you nailed it in the video. sadly disney can no longer create anything good. all the can do is repurpose other people s work.
i will never forgive disney for what they did to ariel  the upcoming live action 2023 remake .
the bigger they are the harder they fall
disney is pretty big though objectively just looking at thier chart  a lot of big names under its belt  youll be surprised what they own  one show failure is a drop in the water  yet a start.
how are they doing with that war with florida  governor i heard. hes s wining disney a apologize to the master.
who would have guessed that not making money with your business would cause you to go bankrupt  guess current-day disney found that out a little slow
no company is too big to fail. blockbuster and myspace were once juggernauts. what happened to them
@red dragon  omg same lol it s always fun seeing a company lose money  d
not really.  they all still have trash coming.  gunn proved that for wb not long ago
every thing doesn t have to be ghey ghey  and more gheyness
except their movies are still making over a billion dollars...
@domino ep  do they now  how exactly did disney lose 123 billion last year then
@domino ep  you copy and pasted greatly  except earnings in first quarter 2023 and expected earnings in 2024 have exactly 0 to do with my statement of losing money in 2022! speaking of simple minds.
@tmac19892007  so you read the 1st paragraph and skipped the rest  maybe i shouldn t have expected so much out of a conservative...
@domino ep  i wonder why i mentioned 2024 from the last sentence if i skipped the rest  i mean you didn t delete it for nothing. now have a good day  the weather is to nice for pointless conversations
@tmac19892007  and i didn t delete it  you don t even understand how youtube works...
@tmac19892007  i suppose you think elon musk lost  200 billion dollars because he s  woke  also lol
with the release of avatar 2 they good rn
i m excited to see these big corperations have a slice of humble pie. they forgot we are customers not consoomers
vanguard will sell to a chinese studio.
@sjoerd derks  just like the code of the west says. something modern disney will never learn
well not always think of k mart
they will just be consolidated into one of the other mega-corps...  nothing of value is gained or lost.
@domino ep  spotted the groomer.
@charles r.  lol  you people are like npcs with your  groomer  nonsense  no wonder your red wave didn t happen...
@charles r.  ok npc
they ve been problematic from day one except they ve largely kept it in the closet.but what do you expect from a cartoon company that has a duck wearing a sailor suit with no pants and speaks with a lisp.
these layoffs were expected because of the economy is slipping into a recession
@gloria thomas  really  i thought the economy was doing well according to brandon.
the only reason that revenue is up at the disney parks. it is because disney has you pay for every little thing.  you have to buy genie plus if you want to actually ride any rides. when fast pass which basically does the same thing used to be free.
no agenda here at all
@samuel grant  nope  not at all
it s a tad higher than that...
@walter bonsell  no its not  in the uk census 1.5  said they were one of the lgbtq .... in america it is probably higher but no where near as high as it is made out to be.
@1000000man1  what the hell does that even mean
lets hope esg existence only promote agenda and we can see it in all major companies
that path included black panther being introduced when pulmutter denied the approval over and over. are you saying that black panther didn t deserve his own stand-alone film  or are there some exceptions to what you are implying
@jab cajun  what are you even talking about
i m perfectly fine with disney dead.
tim allen is the
@zminator1986  who is allen
good point!
it s not about the money. it s about sending a message.
no fix for insanity.
acknowledge their failing brand.can t get someone to acknowledge something when their paycheck and self-image depend on their ignoring it. they would sooner go to the wall still cursing us all than change course.
it seems like he s the only bring in money to the company. i heard his new santa clause movie was a big hit for the streaming service and there will be another one next year.
@john durham  i think it was a tv show on disney plus.
@rey lopez  i didn t hear about so  i assume it was.
well  he did hate communism so that is a valid point.
from what i ve heard  that was never gonna be a problem. hl could ve been trash and still would ve surpassed forspoken.
harry potter seems to have a lot of woke elements still.  it s never enough for the eternal revolution.
the sleeper hit  hi-fi rush  blew forspoken out of the water let alone what hogwarts legacy has accomplished.
@steven heymann  forspoken was never going to succeed on merit. it was destined to be bad.
if you chose a political side you alienate half your audience. they clearly didnt think of that before they stepped into florida to denounce the  dont say gay  bill
even in the sex markets and pornography circles where this kind of sexualization flourishes  this kind of content  lgbt  is still pretty niche and unwanted. i mean how could they ve not seen this wasn t going to be popular
they re not forcing anything down your throat... you can choose to watch it or not watch it. you do have free will even if you want to pretend you don t for the sake of arguing.
@walter bonsell  you re not getting it. when you are used to a product  it becomes part of your life. you look forward to the next installments. the escape from reality. then it jumps the shark. of course i have free will lol.  it s disappointing. you seem to not realize that there are millions like me. but you have a good day and enjoy this crap.
@conrad vogel  of course there are others like you  just like there are others like me. it s like i know there are conservatives out there and fox news and i don t go around saying they re trying to shove their agenda down my throat because i can take it or leave it and i usually leave it but i m not gonna bitch about it because i know that it is useful for others who are not me. i don t know why others can t do the same about disney. seems like people just want something to complain about so they make up stupid problems  and that is across the board .
@walter bonsell  you re not even trying to comprehend my point. have a nice day.
that make sense  it would explain why they persist to do this stuff and losing money
is that why you can only fail upwards and writers who destroy a tv show or movies keeps getting work  hopefully companies stop caring about this esg score. wheee did it even come from
this is why we now have some state legislatures making it illegal for the state to contract with companies that adhere to esg standards. there are movements forming to culturally shun companies and organizations that engage in these practices and to instead fund rival companies that are often christian and or conservative with some libertarian ones in the mix as well.
top gun maverick  hold my beer.
and they can t even do that good
opening video remarks  reworded  still factual.over a year ago disney stated they wanted 50  of their characters to represent 0.014  of the population.
it s going to depend on what is more important to them. the  agenda  or the money. honestly i m skeptical they ll course correct.
not only have they lost millions of subscribers but they ve also had to cut 7 000 jobs. get woke go broke.
yes  it s good to see that the fabric of america still doesn t want woke and letter-ideology thrown on them. as a huge marvel fan  i hope that this leads to disney returning my favorite heroes back to normalcy. and yep  when it s all said and done  the background of all of this is satanic. not today  satan! keep up the good work  research  and presentation skills. god bless
if you love your children keep them as far away from disney as humanly possible.
its not get woke go broke  its go broke  get woke and ultimately croak - razorfist
found you from your hogwarts legacy video and have been loving the channel ever since. thank god we have content creators like you making waves in the right direction. keep it up and i ll keep watching
melonie s adventuring party consists of ima biggit  ter forlyfe  gowok gobrok and a few others.
completely agree  melonie. it s a question of trust. more and more people don t trust disney anymore to be safe for their kids.
go woke and go broke! disney should have realized that from the start and now they re suffering the consequences. by the way  you look great today. can t wait for your stream with critical drinker.
i blamed bob paychek for the  ber woke direction that disney went in after iger left  so i guess we re gonna find out here soon if i m correct. iger did come out recently and talk about how he should be using his wealth and influence to push gun control  so if you ever needed a reason to slap disney across the face  that d be a big one.
they ve gone the  acceptance through repetition  route down at disney but the problem is that their service  disney plus  isn t free  so the masses aren t just tuning in because it s free and easy  no! people literally have to go out of their way to acquire the service  therefore have to think and make financial decisions so disney s strategy won t really work in this instance. maybe if the had a free to air channel it might start working amongst the masses  especially the young upcoming generation
they don t have money  that s exactly what cartman said in south park
hey  melonie. thanks for giving us entertainment news and your insider views. god bless!
hey disney   who s your daddy   gov. ron desantis is your daddy   lol
this is fantastic news!!! also i heard the new ant-man is pretty bad which is even better news. i m making guardians 3 my last marvel movie and i m done. by the way melonie how far have you gotten in hogwarts legacy
as a parent  i can say wholeheartedly i m never letting disney entertainment into my house. my son will enjoy traditional movies and tv shows i grew up with.
watching disney burn brings a smile to my face
i honestly feel a turn coming. going back to being able to say what we want again  even though i already do  without the chance of being outcasted because it isn t politically correct. there s alot of signs of people being tired of being bullied by this loud minority.
everyone s in panic mode. not only disney lol
the mcu is kind of overdone already.spider-man was about the last good thing they did i feel.
@chandller burse  that s true i think as well  people want to point and label no way home  nostalgia bait  but they did that right at least.
@chandller burse  what about deadpool also being the rare outlier good mcu
who s your favourite marvel character
@chandller burse  they definitely need to do a black panther 2.5 with a strong male figure as the main character.
@christopher olson  chadwick is dead they should probably just not do anymore
@chandller burse  they need to have ryan gosling as black panther for diversity sake.
@scott doesntmatter   reproduce their numbers  two bundles of sticks can t create a 3rd bundle of sticks. it s moreso economic as women   lgbt are vain materialistic demographics. think relatively rapidly consuming cosmetics  clothing  accessories  and misc. as opposed to real men buying long-lasting durable goods that can build   repair their own things or purchase self-defense survival gear.
@satoru  this is a generalization though. not every gay person is a vain resource consumer and to be fair pretty much thats all humans we all consume resources and we all drain them.and not every straight man is some carpenter who builds longlasting good shit lol.i love how these comment sections are always people just praising their side of the human race while denouncing others.same for liberals.our species feels more like a mistake i don t think we are getting anywhere and our consumption is getting higher and thats just a fact not some socialist scheme.i am just being nihilistic because of these discussions for some reason lol.
@satoru  even though they cannot procreate naturally gay couples do adopt and have artificially insemination which does add to our population and help kids find homes.
@satoru deadpool isn t part of the mcu yet. he won t be until deadpool 3 comes out.
@satoru  - ooh  ooh  cast david duke as black panther!
bro i would honestly love another go at live action x-men. they can put it in a cinematic universe if they want  but i mainly keep the x-men by themselves doing their own thing. i wanna live action wolverine versus omega red. the problem with disney doing it though it that the x-men is already largely about social commentary. so it s too easy to make it woke. they d screw it up instantly.
can i have  50 alexander
@aaron p.  i just came in to see if someone mentioned that
@triforceman1  alexander is mah boi  he ll hook me up  you watch.
@michael bush  i mean x men was and still sort of is an allegory for racial and other civil right issues.magneto is also a sympathetic villain who is a bit extreme and if i am not wrong magneto and professor x are both based on mlk and malcolm x.
i don t blame mel for not favouriting your cringey comment  you could send me 1mill and i wouldnt do it. no wonder the entire planet laughs at yanks
oh my god fifty dollaaaars
buy only disney renaissance dvds. that s it. i might go as far as early pixar. but i would rather introduce them to studio ghibli instead.
@baked turkeys  studio ghibli does hit different tho gotta love it
get woke  go broke. don t say it like the normies
bahahaha!
as a child growing up with disney i should feel sorry that they re in such a pitiful state but i don t because i feel that the disney that knew and loved died along time
i really wish they would keep the kids out of their agenda. this is much deserved. take notes creators  melonie mac is how you strong female character!
the thing that bums me out is that i have a family member that works at disney world. gotta wonder what s gonna happen with her job.
instant sub! glad to see more ppl on the same wave length about this woke crap
it is not just disney  sports and even music has gone down this road of no return
to be fair  disney  has like over 150 million subscribers... losing a few million is definitely noteworthy  but hardly a crash and burn for them.
and companies still don t understand why they re losing money. money is not infinite. even multi billion dollar companies will eventually lose all their money if they keep being woke.
prepare for more disney re-releases.
hey melonie  when they get back to entertainment i night sub to disney  and netflix. my entertainment is limited because of the woke bs. rather read a book  vernor vinge  a fire upon the deep atm  and have a few paintings to finish. keep on trucking  you re doing a great job.
i know you re not a big star wars person  but i m surprised you didn t mention the stuff they re looking to do with luke. they ve sacrificed the most popular non-movie character  mara jade  to make luke lgbtq. at this point  i feel disney may have done the star wars franchise dirtier than cd did lara.
let s bring back the good wholesome family sitcom!
the subscribers didn t leave  they just discovered that pirating online is much cheaper
disney will never ever just stick to a basic storyline anymore. those days are long gone. i am hoping this mega company goes crashing and burning into a cesspool of their own making
if a children s entertainment company can t understand they need to tell an original story that will leave children as well as adult in awe! without hurting any faith or beliefs or local sensitivity. they have no business in this industry! it is basic knowledge for any international company.ps  and with all their billions they could do it the old fashion s way  hand made!
even hogwarts legacy   aside from it revolving completely around witchcraft and wizardry  has also towed the party line if you know what i m saying.
hi melonie for always bringing these important messages out to the world thatneeds to know.takecare melonie
when i was in disney world couple years ago for family vacation trip that it was blazing hot outside in the sun and the hotel was extremely hot too bc the ac was broken and the ac company could not fixed it bc they were doing something else in orlando florida and so me and my whole family was sweating so much that one of my family members got sick bc how hot our hotel was and they didn t have time to fix the ac units in the rooms. anyway i just want to say that they need to wake up and they need to get their acts together and fix disney world problem before they shut the whole place down and forced to destroy it bc they don t have anything to keep it up and keep it moving in future. anyway i just want to tell you that  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great weekend too melonie.
let s see how much woke stiff they inject to these new sequels
all i can say is   hey  tim.  get your money up front.
hey melonie. wow disney just get s worse.   biggitarmy sweet shirt melonie
well that s for another video possibly  i can t cram everything into one video haha
we used to park the kids on disney xd while making dinner  worry free. can t do that today. how fast disney has fallen in just a few short years. they need a wb-style purge yesterday
i m 63 years old and i can count on one hand the number of times i ve met an lgbt person that i knew was lgbt.  disney is insane.
disney also needs to bring back john lasseter.
i assure you disney is not hurting. it hurts the lowest and junior positions. if anything we might see more of this since the shot callers aren t the ones being fired. but i hope i m wrong.
thank you i l9ve your channel and content. you are saying exactly what i been saying stop supporting and paying for this garbage and they will change it.
i think disney needs to do more with their abc brand like putting  home improvement  and other classic abc shows on d
disney has also changed some of their business deals associations recently. don t get so busy that you forget to drink water.stay safe. take care. have fun.
i ve been saying this for the last 5 years. when anyone goes woke  they will always go broke!
significant transformation  probably translates to  going from 50-60  woke content to 99.9  woke content .
good!
a woman with the head where it is supposed to be  expressing her voice. good.the trending section should feature you  donna  from the internet impact channel  blaire white  and everyone that opposes the dumbfication of the masses.however  the plan in motion is to stupefy. so  no chance in hell. i m impressed by the fact that you appeared on the related videos.
sox was the only thing that made lightyear sell stuff. best and only character in the whole thing.
get woke  go broke
you have to be careful with those numbers melonie.  the 2m subscribers lost came from hotstar in india after disney ceased their contract to stream the ipl  indian premier league  cricket.  the indians love their cricket and without the ipl why would you bother with hotstar.  also the revenue they generated was about 60 cents per customer per month  so chicken feed basically.
lgbt now stands for let s go broke together
i still want my fade with bob cheapchek. at least igor is going to let the creators create and give pixar theatrical releases now. cheapcheck was literally f n everything up!
as a mature adult  i found disney to have the least amount of content that i am interested in. there are a couple of shows that i like in the star wars vien   so i ve cancelled disney again  with some others as well  including netflix  after 10-years i m bored with it  and will wait until the new seasons start. then i ll re-up for a month.
ive always saw disney plus as an extention of the disney channel thay had long ago but sadly thay missed the opertunity to put those old shows on disney plus.
this is the perfect time for george lucas to take back starwars and do wonders with it again.
i finally put it together. melanie sounds just like violet from the incredibles!! the voice that is
that s because most normal people aren t shouting from the rooftops their sexuality. i d say the majority of people are straight  anyway  but everyday people just live their lives and aren t defined by who they sleep with.
great video melonie! i recently just joined the prayer group on discord. it s awesome.
i d give anything for lucafilm to get star wars back instead of it being under disney. or at the very least  disney retconning the sequel trilogy and creating a new one based off heir to the empire and dark empire. could you imagine thrawn in live action  revan  darth malus  the mandalorians vs the yuzan vong ! the stories of luke s decedents. all wonderful stories that disney could have adapted. the synopsis of george s sequel trilogy that will never see the light of day  the only good thing disney star wars has going for it  is rouge one  the mandalorian  maybe kenobi  and the upcoming ashoka show that may introduce thrawn as the  big bad  of the post empire era  building up to the heir of the empire storyline. but  i have much doubt disney would utilize such a great story.
so i m guessing we re no longer going to see those  disney is hiring  ads while we scroll through yt now
it s going to be interesting to see how this turns out
girl you work hard af  great video but damn you do a lot of videos per week. take care of yourself.
absolutely love you rocking the curly natural hair. always looking gorgeous every video.
unfortunately  while i agree that going woke can get you broke  the article you are citing actually says disney  increased subscribers in north america - they lost subscribers in india and southeast asia.   the drop in disney  subscribers   which was bigger than analysts expected   was entirely driven by a 3.8 million sequential decline disney  hotstar  the version of the service offered in india and parts of southeast asia  to stand at 161.8 million at the end of 2022. last year  disney lost streaming rights to indian premier league  ipl  cricket matches  which prompted it to lower growth targets for disney  hotstar in india.in the u.s. canada  disney  gained about 200 000 subs  to reach 46.6 million .
not to mention  disney  doesn t always put out enough content right away when you have to wait for content for months and they don t have a really screaming hit like netflix does and all that stuff or even amazon plus or amazon prime sorry
would they even bring back tim allen to reprise his role  given the beef disney mob have against him
disney buying up hollywood only to crash and burn is music to my ears. we can be done with the lot of them.
imagine walt disney seeing what disney had turned into..it s a good thing he passed away thinking disney was in right hands..i remember watching disney movies as a kid with my parents and siblings it was something we did once every few weeks but i can t even enjoy that with my family anymore with all the woke trash they keep throwing at us..
allen comes out and says his pass to epstein island was revoked from having too much of a good time. disney s response to backlash is overworking pixar again
as a wise man once said get woke go broke
it seems like disney is now part of a bygone era  it s doa on anything they produce now. it s sad  but they did it to themselves.
good news everyone!
you re amazing melonie
happy thursday melonie!melonie please return back to mario kart again with dan vasc  lady rippa  rippa and g g please.
how can they royally screw up properties that basically print money  pretty sad.
wokeness doesnt pay the bills...life catches up to them all
if they fix it most people will  come back to the company and celebrate how great it is. i for one don t think we should. they should be punished and actually have repercussions for what they had done  i mean everything they do going forward should fail because they have tarnished the name of the company that has built generations of people s imaginations
oh yay thank you! so happy you are enjoying prayer group!
and this is when we hear facts
i was born in  92 and grew up with the last of the good disney films. i loved disney and was obsessed with snow white. had most of the older movies on vhs and i would see every new movie that came out. the magic that was in those movies is nowhere to be seen in these new ones.
can all the writers of phase 4 be included in the 7 000 getting laid off
i think in theory  disney  is a great idea. the problem being is pushing woke content. if they avoided wokism and just focused on quality content  they could easily become the most successful streaming service. however they just can t help themselves.
disney is pretty big though objectively just looking at thier chart  a lot of big names under its belt  youll be surprised who they own  one show failure is a drop in the water  yet a start.
this makes me soo happy
disney need to learn from companies like nintendo. why is disney not working on the sequel to big hero 6
here s the thing. corporate wokeness has indeed taken what normally would be crippling losses. however. the wef has been supplementing the losses for anyone big enough to bend the knee.
they really need to stop milking the toy story brand. 3 was about as perfect an ending as it was ever going to get  and anything beyond is just diluting the whole.i miss the days when there was a hard taboo on making sequels to their movies.
i ve been boycotting disney for a few years now and even sold all my disney stock.
it doesn t matter if they start doing good shows movies from now on. they have shown their true face  you know who they are. if you support them regardless  you re supporting all the nefarious stuff you just criticized.don t make peace with evil. destroy it.
that s what happens
i ve been waiting for them to introduce ghost rider into the mcu but at this point i hope they never do  cause u know they will mess it up.
i wonder how much of the current programming is bob igor. he s hardly a solution  he s pretty woke himself but i imagine these programmes  movies are leftovers from the previous wokr ceo.he could ve cancelled them but probably not.i wish 20th century fox was still it s own studio. really sad to see what to expect from the next alien movie
i went to the disneyland park not long ago and you could feel like the park is in its twilight it feels like they can t wait to destroy the place so sad they took splash mountain out
honestly the main reason i believe the buzz lightyear movie failed is because the core premise they structured the entire plot around they got completely wrong.they assumed that the the closer an object moves to the speed of light subjective time stays the same  and objective time speeds up. in fact it is understood that objective time remains the same and subjective time slows down. their entire plot just couldn t have occurred.
toy story 5 ! i did not know that...why  4 ended things great and left me in tears and now you are gonna upheave all that. good grief  disney is chocked.
off topic but i noticed when you went to a page with a dark theme it stopped blowing out your skin tones in the camera. much nicer   maybe a white balance setting for live streaming could do that on the fly  i don t know.
disney put themselves in that position. the studio deviates from old man walt s original mission of original ideas  strict quality control and not repeating past successes. modern day disney is to lazy to do something original and that s why you have she hulk dropping it like it s hot with one of these rapping strippers.
the first zootopia was good but now they are going to ruin the second one
thank you for being unafraid to call out the satanic
we re all toys  woody mac
nah  2 was the perfect ending.  andy is going to grow up one day  we dont know what the future holds beyond that  that should have been it
they are literally replacing everything with 90s zoomers. all this talk of diversity when people born 1991-1998 are the single most over-represented year group in the history of cinema.heck  they wouldn t even wait in the case of that uncharted film  screw it just de-age the chatacters so we can hire zoomers millennials have like  zero reputation. we had harry potter and that was it - and even then the anti-millennial agenda is seen in that fantastic beasts franchise - where the characters are the same age as millennials at the time of release  yet they cast people in their 40s .to play 26 year olds.
probably so!
south park mickey mouse is the best and most accurate version we have. make sure we keep ron desantis relevant.
this is all blackrock pulling strings with their whole social credit score systems for the investments they push to these companies it s soooooo deep it s sick.
f that baby mac  disney has crossed the line. we should boycott anything disney has it s hands in until the monopoly is broken  regardless if they do a 180. that mens movies  theme parks  hulu  espn  or any of the other dozens of companies they bought!!
it s interesting that nintendo is slowly beginning to explore outside of gaming. i won t be surprise if nintendo replaces disney in the future
get woke  go broke!!
problem with making half your characters gay is that to make sure people know they are gay  you need to show them being gay and make it overly obvious  theres other ways but the average marvel or disney writer wont make it subtle  and since disney marvel caters largely to kids and comic enthusiasts they probably want to be lectured on the problems of gay people in their movies as much as the average bond fan wants to hear about how oppressive having bond girls is. these people dont know who their own audiences are
one of the artifices of satan is  to induce men to believe that he does not exist  another  perhaps equally fatal  is to make them fancy that he is obliged to stand quietly by  and not to meddle with them  if they get into true silence.  - john wilkinson 1836. as always  you look great and i look forward to your videos. may god continue to bless you. have a great day.
were frozen and zootopia 2 that big of a hit  we will see if disney can help itself.
i reactived my disney   account right before she-hulk aired since i ve always loved the character and loved tatiana in orphan black. i also canceled my 1 year subscription after episode 5 and got a full refunded. citing the downfall of marvel and quality in general.
i really hope that one dude who jumped between the dude  and girl proposing and taking their ring gets fired. he was a little turd and should have been after he did that
man have they not observed the pattern with other companies movies shows   this sphere of individuals and those otherwise adjacent are not a great demographic to invest in. they re unreliable financially and their focus on politics overrides interest in bottom lines anyway  which  even if you did garner capital as a result of coincidentally catering to them simultaneously  they d probably expect you to reinvest it into their interests anyhow.
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck  and he cast into the sea  than that he should offend one of these little ones. luke 17  2
reep what you sow disney.
strange suggestion  they could try making shows that normal people like instead of pandering to the weirdest screamers on twitter and tiktok.
you go girl!  getwokegobroke  aliensandspaceirl  i m not watching!
also  people need to start realising that it s the ones who are obsessed with  representing minorities  who are actually discriminating. if you go out of your way to specifically hire a black person or gay person  you are discriminating by definition  because you re focused on that.
iger s completely in the pocket of china  so disney s suddenly going to be like  gay  what gay  oh  we can have 3 second kiss scenes that get clipped out
i remember when disney was the pinnacle of children s entertainment. now they are a bunch of groomers. walt must be rolling in his grave. this is not what he had envisioned at all.
disney  we need to make  50 percent of our characters lgbt and even more poc  disabled etc. quality be damned!board  uh sir  we re about to lose  50 of our revenue.
in my chiildhood i loved disney so much. all is not well in the world these days
as a super mario fan  i hope the mario movie turns good when it gets released.
they need shows i am ok with my kids watching everything.   as someone who wants grandkids...  it isn t the current slate.
beyond just this type of stuff i have had issues with shows leading up to the current climate where they promote selfish behavior and other bad habits to kids. kids should be taught how to be better people in this climate with being kind  mitigating screen time and going out and being social.
idk  go boom! just has the voice i could never listen to 24 7 but maybe an hour or so. and on the nose like shapiro with tats and common sense. things that make u hm... see how i evaded the disney there  the boycott didn t have legs  but i still found the game uncomfortably woke. bandai-namco makes my better game without insertion. used the possessive just then because i heard classic madonna sing about a material world just hours before. they  hogwarts devs  could have done something so clever instead  but they were hung up on modern politics. was there a distribution beyond the npc pale  spidey sense is it s not natural it s 20 s and that is nurse ratched on immersion. look  you have harry potter s whole castle looking better than it ever did  and you choose to feck up the bartender in a nearby town calling that a day  i ain t seen no borgin and burkes there neither!
i may or may not speak for other people when i say this  but personally  i don t think it s because we re a bunch of woke-a-phobes. the problem isn t so much the diversity quotas. it s that the lore and the stories suffer because of it. these companies are so bent on shoe horning in this stuff that they lack the standard of quality their predecessors had. you can t just change the main character for diversity and progressivism and expect people to enjoy it. they ve become so obsessed with meeting quotas and giving representation that the plot falls flat  the writing suffers  the acting sucks and the overall esthetic is butchered. not to mention  people don t want to be preached to. they don t go to movies for diversity training. they go to escape and unwind. if they wanted to be force-fed leftist ideologies  they would just turn on cnn.
i hear you... i never subscribed to this  but couldn t it just be the price increase   forced commercials that were implemented in december
any notable firings  curious.
50  says woody and buzz have a deep romantic relationship
they should put walt disney back in charge as an ai chatbot
disney can no longer by trusted  whether their movies or their parks.  we ve had to tell our daughter that the disneyland memories she has  won t happen with her children.  protecting children is too important  to risk exposure to the crap contaminating society in what was supposed to be entertainment.
disney lost subscribers because of sports. yes  disney plus has sports   just not in the u.s.. the walt disney company s q1 2023 report  opens in new tab  released yesterday  feb. 8   shows a loss of 3.8 million subscribers to disney plus hotstar  the version of the service served to india and select southeast asia regions. this is tied to the service losing indian premier league  ipl  cricket matches. in the u.s. and canada even with a soft start to the year  disney plus actually gained subscribers overall  around 200 000 of them in fact.
i really hope disney just dissolves. i would love nothing more than to see star wars go to someone who actually cares about it.
melanie mac go boom  you can t have buzz lightyear without tim allenbuzz lightyear of star command and lightyear  am i a joke to youmelanie mac go boom  yes yes you are because you re not voiced by tim allen
disney thinking they can lure us back in using franchises we know is funny. i dropped disney   disney plus  marvel  and star wars a long time ago. it ll take a lot more than nostalgia to bring me back. the same goes for  warner bros and dc comics. they screwed up established characters so much i barely recognize them. hollywood is a mess too. these days i i m pretty much attached to asian movies  tv  and manga.i can see why you are normal. you were home schooled.
thankfully they can t do that to luke as the star wars mainline franchise is finished they can t reboot the series just to give him a boyfriend. but thankfully we can ignore this and only accept george lucas canon  and ea canon.
me at 09 40 - what the lotso huggin  crud did they turn lotso into!   nah! nah! i can t bear it any longer! xd
have you seen the proud family reboot  not even subtle about it but rather beating you over the head over and over while a kid stands in the corner screaming and crying stop stop he s already dead!
just saw you on drinker s channel! great content!
we called it. i will say  like every ubisoft gamers   ubisoft is next.stocks  going down.gamers  the newest one is only good with all dlc s.the company   a business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.   henry ford.
i wonder if bonnie will be older or andy might come back looking for woody. that would be a good story right their
i m okay with disney being gone forever.
i wonder how much money they are wanting to lose this time around with these sequels  hopefully they will start to bankrupt the parks with movie losses.
for me there are also only 2 reasons for d .  family guy   american dad . as for the disney theme parks  the igbqtandotherchars- fever is said to have broken out there and attendance is down.
those are probably not helping the situation  but those very things were intended to help fix the damage woke-based decisions created  which created mediocre to bad content no one wanted to watch and therefore didn t see a reason to subscribe or continue an existing subscription .
lolwut  do it  tell me how that would work. no im seroous do it oh no my life went to sh t ever since i gave away some toy i use to play with decades ago for a short period of my life. i must track it down!  bahahhaha
@lingr icen  okay so the andy coming back part  is way out their but a time jump with bonnie and looking for woody is a good story or maybe she loses jessie or buzz. al from al s toy barn comes back when he sees woody who is now with bo peep as a lost toy.
@tinmanlover1994  hahhaa ok and when does al say when he sees woody again
@lingr icen  he gets excited and says that he found him and he  realizes that woody is missing his pull string and voice box and he still takes him anyway. buzz or jessie could go missing   bonnie goes looking for them and woody and bo peep ends  up finding jessie or buzz and helps them get home
@tinmanlover1994  but tinman what of mr potato head and his wife and adopted alien children
@lingr icen  well they be with bonnie too still
@tinmanlover1994  but how is their marriage
@lingr icen  its stronger than ever they ve been happily married sence christmas when molly got her when she was a baby at the end of toy story
@tinmanlover1994  great  will there be any celeb guest cameos
@lingr icen  sure hunter hayes ivan moody and jennifer nettles
make me happy to see the people winning
yeah  we re gonna have 50  lgbt characters... and 50  black... and 50  latino  and 50  native american  and 50  disabled  and 50  dwarves. 50  everything! we re just gonna have a whole shit-load of 50 percents.
man star wars alone when done right can probably carry disney through downturn phases. they chose to hate on the people.
disney thinks that it can just paint a new coat of paint and fix these problems.  the challenge going forward is twofold.  the first is the mass number of work employees up and down the ranks  that culture won t change over night.  second  is the middle america conservative customers   they will be loyal to a fault but once the make their switch  waiting for disney plus  to finally produce kid friendly content that trust is not gained overnight.  universal with content like the minions  sing and puss and boats has proven the cartoon  kid friendly winner.  see ya but take your price hike and woke content elsewhere.
oh no  dear lord the humanity  how tragic. how horrible  pulls up bag of popcorn  starts munching
3 20 but dont forget guys  if people protest disney for being transphobic we have to support disney and call our 50  lgbtq quotient a  win.
wokeness ruins literally everything that it touches.
i haven t watched a toy story movie since the second.  i am also now in my 40 s . this definitely reeks of desperation. i honestly hope this fails.

lol  they re making less money  but they re not going broke.  losing money  just means that they are making less money than last year  not that they re in the red.
personally  i can t see how there s an interesting story left in toy story - another film is just superfluous....tho that never stopped fast and the furious as for frozen...we re not there yet i guess  but is there a natural part 3 to that franchise  i highly doubt it. lastly...zootopia was pretty cool. i just wouldn t trust disney screenwriters to create a worthwhile sequel...to anything
they have to be in on it with the government. that s the only explanation. no conscious human being or boss would continue on this path.
unfortunately  if we continue to support disney at all  even though i like tim allen   they ll just use the revenues as fuel for their crap woke cartoons. they wont learn any lesson.
never forgive these companies. drive in the knife  twist  and leave the moldering carcass.
i ve always supported basic rights for gay people  trans people  etc.  so it really sucks that a certain segment of that population has become so aggressive and intolerant. it was always supposed to be about inclusion  not exclusion.
i could not agree more  melonie! let s go the distance  get it  bring back hand drawn animation  no woke ideology shoved down people s throats  treasure planet 2  atlantis 3  get rid of the disney plus nonsense. bring back the popularity of dvds  stop pandering to waaaactivists. cancel the neverending story remake now! when racism wasn t so condescendingly shoved down people s throats  a good example of how to do racism issues right is static shock  learn from them. they handled tough topics with maturity and more importantly  with compassion and understanding. bring back those good old days!
disney   don t worry  we ve heard you guys loud and clear  here comes toy story 5  which will explore a gay romance between woody and buzz.
disney didn t have to create disney  because they already owned hulu.  hollyweird shows what they re about  lgbt   by putting that   sign behind any name.  sadly  it makes me wonder about dw .
yeah...the alphabet cult has taken over disney  the only fix is to cut it out cold turkey. while disney has always been a mixed bag of nuts  things have gotten worse.
great to see people boycotting this stuff
i m shocked that  pastors  take their  families to  disney  world    i believe  god  is not  pleased with  their  actions.
get woke  go broke!
i mostly watch this channel to see what kind of crazy stuff melonie is gonna say next lol
satanic ideology  she says  as her idols are on full display behind her. lmao
you know  i m glad i watched young rippa first  as he makes a far better analysis and understanding of the information at hand. you  your just doing your usual reverse karrening  ie reee woke bad  ha ha we right  you wrong  which is about as informative as it is boring.
less than five percent of the people in the world are lgbt but disney wants fifty percent of their characters to be     it s not exactly proportional representation.
it s too late. i will never forgive disney.
hogwarts legacy is the wokest game i ve ever played! i m loving it  but for a game set in the 1800s there are so many poc  a lesbian professor and the owner of honeydukes appears to be trans!
great comments.i have no intention of subjecting my kids to anything disney.
yep let s get back to content that appeared to not have a message but most certainly did lol. i ve been on a rampage against conservatives here lately because they reminisce about the good ol days of story telling but they won t acknowledge the christian religious elements which made them great. this country was founded by christians and christian theology saturated every part of this country but is definitely being attacked now more than ever. when there s a story about overcoming hardships people think there s no messaging there but you d be surprised how much it resembles some story from the bible. essentially people want biblical story telling they just don t want to know it s biblical lol.
the only recent disney movies i personally loved was raya and the last dragon  the frozen movies and turning red
they ll just go even further woke   lets just enjoy the train-wreak.
the problem with going down the lgbtqrs-infinity-ambersand-xyz community road is that there is no way to walk it back.  if you do  the alphabets will be like   if you support  the gays  why are you putting fewer gays in your projects    do you think there are too many gays   you can t be like   well  you see gays  for a long time there were no gays.  then  we tried to make up for it  but we overcorrected.  now  you re like 2  of the population but you re 60  of the characters so  yeah.  at this rate  the birth rate will start going in reverse and humanity will be extinct by 2085.  so  we need to course correct. yeah  the alphabets will not consider that an acceptable answer.
i have no sympathy for them  the projects to come will either reek of desperation or maybe they will just limit themself to entertain the audience.
after hearing that disney is planning to make at least 50  of their characters queer in upcoming releases  i have just cancelled my disney  subscription.
hunny  marvel is doing just fine  infinity war and end game both did a billion a piece  and that s  just two movies. i don t know what this girl has against marvel or disney  but they re doing just fine!  i understand your conflict with the non binary prefixes pertaining to children   but it doesn t mean they re not doing good
funny. because 6 months ago  i said  next year disney will turn 100. and next year could be the year  people will remember as the year where disney did fall. and now  2023  it happens. 8 months until birthday left. we will celebrate for sure
let s be honest strange world and buzz lightyear were just bad and the messages of you are your own worst enemy and let s ditch electricity and live in the dark are not what we expect from disney. i am a liberal progressive but even i don t think there is any place for pushing sexual narratives in animated shows for children.
you can t screw over mister home improvement. ra  ra  ra!
hopefully  they sell star wars back to george lucas  with the mandalorian and related shows . if filoni and favreau go with the property back to lucas  star wars will become the most colossal series ever!!
melonie mac making it rain red pills  calling out disney for their  satanic  messages... to anyone doubting this claim allow me to share two quotes with you   no one to tell us no  or where to go or say we re only dreaming   - a whole new world from aladdin  a movie where a thief takes a teenage girl from her bedroom window and shows her a  whole new world  in defiance of her  strict or authoritarian parents and upbringing.  compare this to   do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law   aleister crowley  a man who needs no introduction. also peter pan  a man abducts children from their bedrooms and takes them to a place where they will never grow up... sounds like the fantasies of people who know their way around a  wayfair cabinet catalogue  if you know what i mean... i wonder how many disney executives went to epstein island
i know you stopped doing a bible passage in videos but i feel like proverbs 1 is very appropriate  particularly 20-27 20 wisdom is like a woman shouting in the street  she raises her voice in the city squares.21 she cries out in the noisy street and shouts at the city gates 22  you fools  how long will you be foolish  how long will you make fun of wisdom and hate knowledge 23 if only you had listened when i corrected you  i would have told you what s in my heart  i would have told you what i am thinking.24 i called  but you refused to listen  i held out my hand  but you paid no attention.25 you did not follow my advice and did not listen when i corrected you.26 so i will laugh when you are in trouble. i will make fun when disaster strikes you 27 when disaster comes over you like a storm  when trouble strikes you like a whirlwind  when pain and trouble overwhelm you.
it s  get woke  go broke. happens every time.
you cannot tell a  good story   without ideology.as a christian you should know this.ephesians 6 king james version10 finally  my brethren  be strong in the lord  and in the power of his might.11 put on the whole armour of god  that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood  but against principalities  against powers  against the rulers of the darkness of this world  against spiritual wickedness in high places.
myself and a few of my family have canceled our subscriptions in the last 2 weeks. wakanda forever was the last straw  watched an hour and then canceled my subscription. she hulk i watched first episode and then turned it off 30 mins in. as they say go woke  go broke.
disney s is not going broke. also these layoffs were expected in with line with the on-going media layoffs by other media companies since the economy is slipping into a recession.
i think there isnt anything inherently wrong with gay and lesbian characters per say  they exist in the whole and kids should know about that. however... i think lumping trans and other alternative lifestyles into that label is a huge mistake especially in media. but i also think shoe horning those characters just to do it isnt a good look either. its funny how disney just doesn t know nesgogia works. can you imagine if they put tim allen in the lightyear movie  and just made it a fun sci fi adventure  they should of have it take place in 90s.
disney  rise and fall
hogwarts legacy is a modern woke game lmao. it s more  diverse  than modern times and its set in the 1800s. as much as i like the game it just feels like complete propaganda every time i see the 80  poc population.
turning red was a great educational film for young girls
calling woke satanic is making it religious  i wouldn t do that because that s subjective. what isn t subjective is that woke culture is ruining everything
i know parents who still have no clue about disney  agendas
disney hears ya  disney don t care.
it s way to late for them now
you were homeschooled  i was at home. worked
yeah but disney is firing people. but not 1 ceo or board member is taking a pay cut!!!
how many franchises have they ruined now
this is some good news..well deserved if they tried to make children go woke.
zootopia 2 was supposed to come out in 2020
announcing the movies doesn t mean they will be good.  i expect at least half of them to be bad.
pander to zoomer  go broke sooner
it sounds like they are if they are thinking about selling hulu. i  think something i d definitely happening and it s not good for disney.
homeschool ftw melonie
they messed up but don t want to admit it  just like their disney movie. let him keep digging that hole!
walt is turning over in his cylinder.at what disney tried to do.
go woke go broke!
for star wars if they could bring back gina. the chances of this happening is 0 .
i m pretty sure they will bastardize those films and sneak in identity politics
dropped disney last year and not looking  back.
toy story 5  we didn t even need a toy story 4. i love how they think they are trying to make a number 5 as an  apology.  it s a little late for that disney.
so maybe toy story 5 will star a new transormer i ll see myself out.
but they are clueless. they will never connect the dots. the wokeness will continue.
they re not putting their classic content on disney plus. they put some stuff on there but very little compared to what they have. that s why i cancelled it
this will hardly affect them.
can you have buzz lightyear without tim allen  yes. patrick warburton was the voice of buzz in buzz lightyear of star command. that s what the fans wanted  but nooo  they gave us not toy story inception instead.
the actors can be but they have to be able to act. if their only acting ability is to be who they really are. that s not acting.
i m a c  gay man and it s actually reached the point where i have  woke  lgbtqia   nb and bipoc repurposing battle fatigue due to their use of force  fan-shaming  and horrible representation choices  they aren t even doing it well.
problem will be no one will trust them  movie will be out for a few weeks before people will go see it.
well now they claim all their classic materials are  problematic  so guess they f d themselves by pandering lol
i moved a lot so didn t get all the school issues and didn t do college did a internship instead
at this point they are done.
hello! there was a balloon  and he went boom. it was winnie the pooh s balloon  you know
get woke go broke  i wonder how gina carano s new movie turned out  bet it s made millions!
i use to love the mcu. wtf  disney
that was a line  you don t want to pander to the woke mob  they ain t got money hahahaha!
toy story 5  gimme a damn break
your a gem .
this girl is super cool.
i don t watch disney movies anymore. i d need to hear something specific before watching another. it d take more than just being called  toy story 5
i m not happy about people losing their jobs  but it was seen from a mile away since the force awakens and wandavision
wactivists  keyword of the day.
who s that knockin  at the house of mouse  tax man s knockin  at the house of mouse. irs is gonna shake em  down. take all profits from the house of mouse. they re going to fall  gonna break down and bawl when they lose it all at the house of mouse.
i got based and found my place.
need to not go to the parks if you really want to hurt disney.
and they making luke skywalker part lqbt  how that going to help ! !
did you hear that the grammy s had a satanic dance
lets just stop paying for their nonsense content  they will learn the hard way
they re all going down one by one.
go baby sister goooo!!!
imagine making content for a small amount of people that don t even support your brand just to lose millions and possibly billions of dollars. that s what these companies are doing now it s crazy
just canceled me disney subscription  would of done it earlier but i had it for free for a year and just ran out
toystory 5  where woodie blows mr potato head for inclusivity.
uh yeah it flopped
nope  never supporting disney ever again  no forgiveness  no mercy  sweep the leg!
its gonna be too difficult to trust disney ever again. fool me once  ya know....
i really wanted to watch the mandalorian  but i refused then and refuse now  to give woke ass disney a single penny of my hard earned cash!
disney is panicking alright they announced the completely unnecessary toy story 5 for gods sake leave it the hell alone
love the perspective
bye disney!!!!!
you know what  bob iger flooded disney with woke in the first place  and he s determined to keep it that way  the message is more important than profit. fine by me! let disney die  folks. it hasn t contributed meaningfully to culture in decades.
they re too far in now. it s downhill all the way now.
because if  love is love  why should we have restrictions.these people opened pandoras box as we were mocked what it will lead too.we were right  again .
glad i dropped d  they even sent me a email why i unsubscribed so i responded with a very lengthy reason
ivotewithmywallet
i don t like them either but it is a recession. every major company is starting to lay off its workers. most recently  apple was behind on earnings for the first time since 2016. so it s not like disney is the only company hurting here. during recessionary periods  companies have to begin lay offs.
...the thing is to address the problem...not retreat from it...
honestly the lesson needs to be learned not to mess with our children  make em sweat it out for a few more years.
wait there s a toy story 5  why though
until all their pedaphiles and are fired.  no disney ever
what was wrong with red panda movie lol
yeah  im cancelling my account as well...  i was using d  for mandelorian  loki and wandavision for a time  but there has been no progress on new seasons  so i gave up on it. willow was on my list of things to watch  but they made that show utterly trash and super woke.  so bye bye disney  it s been fun.
little mermaid about to show disney
gd this chick is fine!
consumers have the power we ve always had the power we just need to prove it. show these companies who s boss really. lol
great
this is why i mostly do japanese entertainment. no woke  .  i stop  reading comics and reading manga and watching anime and playing japanese games like kingdom hearts and digimon. go woke go broke
woke disney gets what it deserves for destroying walt s legacy  pixar  lucasfilm  marvel  and star wars!
the tides aren t turning so to speak  woke has always equalled broke.rage-bait click reports may make the marketing team look good for a month but the permanent brand damage and loss of millions     is the result of their bull    .
and happy endings please
hold the line troops out resolve must not waver
fun fact disney actually owns hulu  futher proving disney   is pointless.
maybe i m over whelming myself  but disney still making tons of money. people still buy their crap. i want to see results. take em out.
i was a massive star wars fan. i didn t even watch the last star wars movie. when they got rid of gina i stopped watching the mando. f disney.
don t forget about the santa clauses... tim allen was back in bed with disney pre-toy story 5.
go woke get cancelled thats the 21st century!!!
is there something wrong with red  i liked it.
shouldn t have brought fox 71 billion disney
okay  i can maybe understand doing frozen 3 and zootopia 2  but toy story 5 ! i stopped after ts2 personally  but from what know ts3 was a good place to end the franchise never mind ts4.
it s over for disney i don t allow my kids to watch anything from them nor do we support any of their theme parks were good
2.3 million of those subscribes that quit disney  would probably go to netflix. if netflix didn t cancel shows like  inside job .
fellow homeschooler!!!
let s collectively bring more attention to entertainers like candace cameron bure  kirk cameron  chris pratt  kevin sorbo  james woods  john voight  and of course tim allen. we also need to get the word out more regarding christian and even conservative media groups publishing wholesome family oriented entertainment like great american media and organizations like the blaze and the daily wire. heck  even christian conservative shock jocks like steven crowder push good messaging  even if it is a bit too edgy at times. give the public alternatives that makethem laugh and smile and know that they are not alone in the face of this propaganda onslaught coming from the far left  and they will be the strongest foundation you will even find to reorient society back to a stable  prosperous  and accepting society for all of god s children.
there was a frozen 2
hulu used to have all the disney movies before plus  aswell.
chris pratt what he is super popular lolthe dude s voicing mario.
oops  i forgot prageru.
oof when disney releases earnings report lol in iger we trust
i m a gay 21 year old man and i ve been against the woke lgbt pandering since onward. i grew up watching shows like scooby doo and teen titans. not once did i think  gee i wish there were gay characters in my cartoons
disney about to be pluto
it is so bad at public school s that my sister is sending 1 of my niece s to a christian school.
legitimately very little on d  i d ever watch even if they weren t an abhorrent company  but they are so i definitely won t ever be supporting.
melonie is the best
uh oh didney go bwoke.
funny  you mentioning them potentially doing a toy story 5 to gain peoples  trust.....that franchise lost my trust after toy story 4.
toys story 5  buzz and woody get married.frozen 3  elsa s new girlfriend.zootopia 2  judy goes independent.
i want to see disney burn. i m tired of this crap. we need to do something about esg scores too. pass a bill or something that makes it illegal for a mega corporation to give money to other companies for a stupid woke score so the smaller companies don t have to make good products anymore. they just need to push the message. something needs to be done about black rock for sure.
i get the representation idea but 50  is over doing it  and in kids shows  its just not necessary.
thanks! i love your mind and morals. if your single i d like to be friends.
not a dime for disney.
it s funny watching the meltdown after we told them all so . go woke go broke . stick to making entertainment
serves them right let them have more loses
hopefully disney will start selling marvel and lucasfilm to studios who can actually make a decent movie.
meh kids deserve to learn about satan. he knows how to party
changing splash mountain into a black magic voodoo ride will cost them riders. why change your best most successful ride is another stupid act. how do they keep trying to ruin the company.
i unsubed from disney  after they dropped gina carano. if disney wants to get people back  they would need to drop most of their current production staff and hire people that actually have talent. the people their streaming service target have kids. so people with kids don t normally go for the woke content  therefore the loss of subs. injecting sexuality in childrens movies and tv shows is gross. let kids be kids.
bless your heart. shouldn t you be wearing a helmet or something
they aren t going broke another one of their movies made over a billion dollars...
disney s plus failure failure failure failure
luv ya melonie  but please properly read the article. the lost of disney plus members has nothing with the garbage that they have been putting out. in fact  they actually gained subscribers in the us. the lost came from them not renewing the exclusive  streaming rights of the ipl  a cricket league the size of our nfl  in india. wish it was because of the woke agenda but it s not and say it is kind of fake news again love you content but please be more responsible
disney s magic genocidal sweatshop s bout get wiped from the face of entertainment.
donald dump should just buy disney
i totally agree. the should children films or family films . not this woke crap and politics. let children be children. children learn about this on film or in the classroom. bravo !!!!
amen!

yeah i m glad i don t have disney  anymore.  technically i never did  i just piggy backed off of my sister s account at the time  but yeah i m better off without it.  do we really need a toy story 5   did we need a toy story 4   the third one was a good place to end  they should have just left it alone.  then again disney should have left a whole lot of stuff alone  but they didn t and here we are!!!
what is this disney stuff you speak of
thanks!
hope they go bankrupt..
disney will never make any new ips
i dropped disney  way before she-hulk and have gone the way of the pirate. i ain t paying to watch their garbage.
hahahaha suffer!
50  of the characters being lgbtiqrv  is not enough. only 110  will do.
disney should take hulu and go back under netflix.  so should hbo.
selfinflictedstupidity
thank you so much!
disnope!
get woke get broke baby
don t deadopen inside
good.
well they didn t need a toy story 5 we will see if they mess it up
if you want to break disney stop going to parks completely.  go to another park instead. or don t go there at all.
no offence mel  i remember you how you sold yourself to cdpr  and flew to poland for promotion in 2015    i remember that  i remember seeing this  lets invite all youtubers  from cdpr  and i remember you there    not judging  my only issue. talk about positive stuff  youre becoming just another  hey look how woke it is  chan    thats not healthy for you. make a 2h video of how lara croft should be portrayed
good i m glad
disney is not how it used to be that s for sure. this stuff shouldn t be pushed on kids!!
based  woke  any other buzz words you want to throw out
as a hardcore star wars fan  i finally recently cancelled my disney  subscription. i am so disappointed with the recent offerings for the franchise and all of the other woke shit.
yeah the woke movement is about to die
thats it im calling it first. toy story 5 will end with a gay kiss between woody   buzz  elsa will come out as non binary etc in frozen 3 and zootopia 2 will be all about diveristy and inclusion overload.
the racist crap they are spewing out on disney kids really needs to hurt them
i m moving away from the entertainment industry on the whole.  sick of their trash.  too much trash.  too much woke.
toystory 5  it should have ended with 3. maybe i ll renew disney  after heads roll  twitter-style.
disney still has black little mermaid  latina snow white and indian peter pan coming out this year and next year. can t see any of them being a success.
go woke go broke. let disney burn to the ground. my only hope is they sell star wars back to george lucas. beyond that i am fine seeing it all turn to ash
black little mermaid wouldn t have been an issue if she wasn t ariel. also the girl playing snow white was really good in west side story so i see why they picked her.
nah i m good they are just trying to save themselves  i m supposed to forgive them for trying to taint the mindset of children they can go you know what. hope they collapse as a company and i hope we stop funding other woke companies.
i don t have disney   netflix and such shitpools. not giving money to the brainwashmachines.instead of going woke  and broke  they could have made proper remake of their  black hole  without adding bullshit and so then making it this century s 2001  space odyssey with more horror elements and awsomeness.i hope that movie brand of their gets proper - propaganda-less - reboot when they realize the sinking ship haha - the only good thing that could come out of this whole would be that haha
i don t even mind a lgbt character here and there  but 50  in what world does that make sens
satanic ideology! cringe
disney destroyed star wars for me...
really  toy story 5  i mean no more story ideas  just sequel the crap out of everything  don t get me wrong i hope it s good but as with all things disney for the last few years i m going to wait for the reviews.
you hate the mandalorian
a big corporation like disney should know better than to pander to the smallest group  who just so happens to be the group who hates to work. so you make content for the smallest group of people who make no money while insulting your hard-working customer base.
drink water
they just better not fuck with kingdom hearts
disney has been dead for 15 years.
they will make elsa a lesbian  just wait
why do people still go to their theme parks   its dirty with trash everywhere and the rides break all the time.
toy story 5  what ! disney you are so creatively bankrupt it s insane! we don t want or need a 5th toy story. we didn t even want a 4th!
dear melonie did it hurt when you fell from heaven   cuz you an angel !! btw i m single and also a super skilled samurai warrior. dm me.
50   that s bull. i think 1 hundie percent. they made my boi luke skywalker gay.
when the board is littered with the synagogue of satan   what do you expect
never give up never surrender  tim allen. are you part asian d
with all this sexual stuff for kids  it gives the impression that these people are secretly pedophiles. seriously  why constantly have characters confessing that they are gay  kids don t think about that kind of stuff. they re talking about marvel movies  sports or online games. these people always wanting their characters lgbt to tell kids   it s ok if you re like this  comes off as creepy.
yey and i m one of the 2.4 millions.
exactly. it s pushing things on people who never asked for it
today s disney is as far removed from the og disney of the 50s   90s as modern israel is from biblical and crusades israel
maybe all corporations make shitty art. perhaps capitalism is the problem.
toy story 5 ! that franchise was over after the third movie. toy story 4 was just awful. don t know how they ll cram a 5th movie into that already ended story.
i m glad they are they ruined so many ips so many characters like come on bro  why now after almost 50 years they got to make luke skywalker gay really
i won t watch unless buzz comes out as bi and woody gets a race swap.
dinsney has a history of being racist. never getting over finn from from star wars.
i don t care if someone is lgbt.  i doubt they care that i m not. businesses used to know to target their audiences.  most people in the country are not homosexual. that s just a fact  and we do not want our children seeing this lifestyle portrayed in cartoons and made for children programs. so  we will avoid this content.
they got what they fuc..... deservenever forget star warsmarveltoy storyand so much more
thank god  was so sick of all this watered down trash.
let s make children content that includes disabilities before trying to force an inclusion of lgbt. everyone needs to feel included  or they are normal. why only included lgbt  because controversies get publicity  children are learning how they feel they don t know what lgbt is.. they just know i have friends and i like to play.

50  lgbtlmnop eh   well  that s  representation.   everyone knows that 50  of us are lgbt.  to me  this deal with tim allen is like their half-ass deep faking luke skywalker into the end of the mandalorian. too little - too late. the only thing i want to see from disney is an utter collapse. - a boy can dream.
we thought emo and gothic and hippie culture in the  60s to the  2000s is woke  .... no it wasn t.......... good old days........ .....
the mouse must die
disney  just like netflix and amazon  is trash. the writing is terrible. the messaging is obnoxious. i knew disney was going down the drain when they shat all over luke skywalker. they ve now completely jumped the shark with all of the regressive woke nonsense.
a less than 1  drop in their subscriber base  during a world wide recession when luxuries  like streaming services  are the first things people forgo. i think you maybe overestimating your woke broke narrative.
i m all for everybody being recognized and stuff like that but you should not have to push all of this stuff on young kids why can t we just let kids be kids why do we all always have to put people and young people in certain categories is that what the world has become i was born in the 70s and i m all for equal rights for everyone and all that stuff but you shouldn t be pushing longer than stuff on kids all these big corporations how to get behind some sort of cause and i don t think it s necessary.
i support the lgbt but disney changing characters to get more money qoute on qoute i just wanna watch movies i m the same with anything that s romantic just makes me turn it off so like disney wake up xd
wasn t toy story 4  like   terrible    haven t most pixar movies lately been garbage   yeah  i won t be holding my breath on toy story 5...
considering that lgbt isn t representative of 50  of society  seems like a horrible idea.
old woke vs new woke
can we agree to eliminate all kissing  love  sex  and nude scenes. straights  gays  whatever. they are just breaks in the story line and rarely add value to the story.
why can t we just say gay anymore  why does it have to be lgbtqa  -xyz  it all means the same damn thing.
im not gonna watch any of those movies  they are just going to further ruin toy story  frozen  and zootopia. all the characters are gonna be trans and gay and it will have no storyline like everything else they produce. i ve wasted enough money and been disappointed by disney im not falling for their bs anymore lol i hope that sinking ship finally sinks and sony buys up everything they own
love all the friday night tights crew.. but... you always say star wars is failing when mandalorian and andor where great. give credit where its due otherwise you lose credibility
you re a christian right  so then you must know that this isn t going to get better but far worse until the lord returns.
aren t ya a christian   are ya aware that christians can t have tattoos
toy story 4 was already an unnecessary series continuation.  and it was only okay with cringey girl-boss energy.  now they want to do 5   trash.
you hate mandalorian
50  of people aren t lgbt tho. also disney doesn t really have anything i want to watch besides the occasional marvel movie the shows have sucked besides mandalorian.
zootopia was horrible
this is not good!
conservativeswhendisneylosesmoney   ...because woke.   conservativeswhenelonmuskloses 200 000 000 000   ...
post-lasseter pixar sucks!  nothing but derivative  non-original crap.  makes me sad.
yup.stop involving kids in their adult issues and stop with the trans support. it s wrong  disturbing and creepy. there s no such thing as a   trans kid  . no such thing.stop.
we don t need everything lgbtq lol
i loved the mandalorian  never denied that
