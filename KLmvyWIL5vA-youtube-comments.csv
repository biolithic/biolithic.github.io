who is she  she s beautiful. - luke the second he sees a fuzzy blue hologram of leia.. no. luke is definitely not gay.
luke is definitely not gay -- based on his reaction to that kiss he got from his sister before he knew she was his sister.
hamill also said that luke would never harm animals after the snow monster scene in empire strikes back  yet luke said straight up in new hope that the shot into the exhaust pipe was possible since he used animals as target practice back home. remember  luke is not mark hamill s character  he is george lucas  character.
1. the way leia kissed luke and how he reacted  he was most definitely not gay.2. if luke is gay then that effectively erases any hope of mara jade appearing in the future. which was probably never going to happen anyway because of kk.
at this rate  every fictional character will be anything but straight in 10 years. just...exhausting how this continues.
other countries  please give us foodus  please make fictional characters gay
mark hamill  luke skywalker is gayhomer simpson  no he s not
in the pre-disney books  luke was married to mara jade. she was one of the most popular characters ever and was a legit strong woman  as a trained assassin and jedi. star wars is dead.
he s not a gay character  he s a straight character in george lucas canon  he married out of love in the expanded universe comics and had several children.
mark hamill is literally becoming the poster boy for  hey fellow kids
mark hamill is a very talented actor who left his mark   badum-tss   on pop culture forever as luke and the joker and that s massive... but somehow he still acts like a failed  forgotten celebrity who will say and do and agree with whatever it takes to stay relevant  so people will like him and talk about him all the time.
if he was gay  why was he attracted to his own sister
happy valentine s day  melonie! luke skywalker is not gay and will never be gay. i m really sick of the woke mob turning our favorite characters into twisted versions of themselves.
i m pretty sure he had a wife back when the novels were included in canon
luke ain t gay mark you can t lie to yourself
mark hamill has to find some way to appeal to the woke scolds. his marriage to mara jade was very public  and we have a movie where he had a huge crush on a woman that would later be his sister.
not surprise that mark hammil supports luke being gay. he is extremely chucked. it s good to see your videos again. you look great today!  3      -
mark hamill  luke is gay.obi-wan  you were supposed to destroy the sith  not join them.
eu legends luke skywalker is the husband of mara jade and they have a son named ben skywalker.
roses are red  chicken comes from eggs  and for the love of god  luke skywalker is not gay.also happy valentines day to everyone. not just the couples  but the singles  and people in platonic relationships too.

watch the latest edition  he says  yas queen  shes fabulous.  they did the same thing to dumbledore but we all love hogwarts legacy right
couldn t take his eyes off her hologram. idk seems pretty ambiguous.
thank you that s what i was saying disney is crazy
oh my god  han solo is so hot! -jake skywalker
who is she  her hair is fabulosa dahling!  -- luke skymincer  star wars 2025 remaster
@autoinfanticide  actually yeah i do cause it s a good game and the trans character in the game isn t throwing it in your face constantly.
devil s advocate  gay people understand the concept of beauty as well  even if it s not sexual. for example  i acknowledge that brad pitt in legend of the fall is a very pretty man  but i don t want to make out with him.
@ashkihyena  and luke was so subtle no one even knew he was gay! enjoy supporting the woke agenda.
@taterboob  counterpoint  that may be true but thats not what this is and you know it
this. it may have been inadvertently incestuous  but it was definitely a straight man s reaction.
exactly! he s definitely bisexual.  kidding  kidding .
we don t even need to explain this in the first place.in the deleted scenes he got a potential girlfriend.
the fact he was married
luke turned gay because he kissed his sister.just like me.
@timmy turner  omg
@spaceranger 76   this  nothing  hamill wants you fans to talk about this stupidity and make himself feel validated. you don t even have to rationalize about this  of course luke is not. jedis never cared about relationships that much. anakin did and look what happened to him.
@ redacted   meanwhile in the high republic  they ve gone 180  and jedi indulge in hook-up culture.
@taterboob  ok fine  but you know damn well where all this bullshit is coming from
@autoinfanticide  i don t love hogwarts legacy  i love that others are hating it. people who hate me are mad. good enough for me.
@youtubeaccountname  what do you hate about hogwarts legacy  wouldn t you have to play it to hate it  or do you just randomly have opinions of things without any actual knowledge or experience
who is she  she s fabulous!  - gay skywalkeras someone that grew up reading  legends  and crushing on mara jade  seems like the biggest grift in the history of sci-fi.
for one thing  i thought jedi were supposed to be celibate. for another  wasn t luke s cornfed ass married to a bangin  redhead chick in the ex-u
@taterboob  yes  but he was also not pleased later on when han was trying to move in on his action.
it was a cumpliment luke is definitely gay hahaha just a joke who knows
@youtubeaccountname  i understand this sentiment  but to pay for the game as an antiwoke statement just makes you a chump.
that doesn t mean he s not gay  whether he is or not is irrelevant .gay people can still admire beautiful woman and never once feel sexual attraction towards them.
@dragon ball fans can t read  huh
apparently a lot of fake fans lied about watching the first movie.
@dragon ball fans can t read  that s true you can appreciate the beauty of a woman and still be gay  just like a straight man can appreciate that another man has an admirable physique  but it seemed fairly obvious that luke appreciated leia. not just aesthetically but in the way that a man appreciates a woman. the evidence of this goes back to the books. just about every writer for star wars after the trilogy felt that luke s sexuality was obvious and wrote a female counterpart in the now non-canonical books. let s ask a different question. in the original trilogy  was there ever a male romantic interest for luke and was there any indication that he was gay purely from the context of that trilogy
slash fans  just because luke demonstrated sexual attraction towards a female doesn t mean he s not gay. also slash fans  did you see the look spock gave kirk when he was mackin  on that orion dancing girl  he obviously wants him so bad  squeeee! it gets to the point where it s embarrassing to the point of pathetic watching grown-ass people obsess like adolescent girls over which port fictional characters are dropping anchor in.
@the mighty fiction  i m guessing you re just a troll. i think it s embarrassing reading a comment from someone who belittles others for having passions  having a strong attachment to good stories  and actively participating in a particular fandom. do you have anything that you are passionate about  it s not about which port fictional characters are dropping anchor in it s about being faithful to the source material. it s like if an art collector who passionately collects paintings by picasso goes out to buy a painting by him but finds out that someone repainted all over the damn thing and added new things to it to  improve  its overall quality.
luke is definitely from an alabama in a galaxy far far away.
@nousos  twitter dose not mean customers  customers aka star wars fans spend money not people on twitter.i don t care if anyone is lgbtq  but making everyone lgbtq  isn t helping.
@toy car   sushi writer  wrong number pal
@nousos  what number are you a sith lord
@nousos  what are you talking about
@nousos  i don t know you  i don t want your number.
@toy car   sushi writer  likewise
idk luke and han solo had a lot of sexual tension going on there. i mean the way luke held his lightsaber and han readied his pistol
@loki-of-asgard  maybe
@ashkihyena  sounds better than whatever far cry 6 did with their transgender character. all they did was throw it in the player s face about their transition and how hard it was.
@themightyfiction8792  no they aren t celibate. they can have sex  but not relationships according to george lucas.
luke was into leia until he found out  she is his sister.  there was some kind of competition between luke and han over leia.
@sulfkorb4065  yea there was  more or less. but if you think about it  han already won in empire strikes back anyway. whatever feelings luke had for leia were replaced with brotherly love in return of the jedi.
@sulf korb  nobody said otherwise. but to go from that to luke is gay is just.....lol.
@sulf korb  pretty much. mark hamill can go get topped if he enjoys it so much. not sure he isn t already.
100  correct
@inlikeflynn  is there anything in my post that indicates to you that i m a fan of the modern obsession with retgaying classic characters like luke skywalker  velma dinkley or bobby  assman  drake  because i am certainly not. bobby drake  i m not the assman. jean grey  well  as far as i and brian michael bender are concerned  you are the assman.
@the mighty fiction  i asked if there was anything that you are passionate about. i m aware that you don t care about what you consider to be low-brow entertainment. maybe you like art  ballet  or music instead  now imagine for a moment if someone took your favorite ballet like swan lake  and completely changed the story around. instead of odette and siegfried vying for each other s affection odette and the evil sorcerer murder siegfried in the most despicable way imaginable  siegfried is suddenly gay for no apparent reason  to appeal to modern audiences   the beautiful tchaikovsky score is replaced with rap music  and instead of ballet  they decided to replace it with modern dance. now i m sure these changes would appeal to some people  but the core audience of swan lake are people who enjoy ballet  and if there is no actual ballet dancing  then can it even be called ballet anymore  i m not asking you if you care about star wars  but do you feel any empathy or compassion whatsoever star wars fans are watching something they care about dismantled bit by bit  and when they protest  they are belittled and called a pack of squabbling 40-year-old children at best or racist and sexist at worst.
nobody really know ls sexuality because lucas really defined the character.
no  but mark hamill is
@the mighty fiction  i do hope that you are right. that all of this can just be imagined away like a bad dream  but i doubt that it can be. in ghostbuster s case  almost nobody watched it  and it was easily forgotten  but how many bad movies and tv shows doesn t it take to completely ruin a brand. the analogy of a straw breaking a camel s back comes to mind.
@inlikeflynn  well  like i said  they can ruin the brand for themselves  nobody else. take  for example  the fortunes they pissed away on toys and action figures that are now sitting on shelves collecting dust bunnies and discount stickers. that s their money  not ours.
gay luke  like  oh my gawd. who does her hair
@autoinfanticide  different story. hogwarts legacy is before dumbledore was born. and yes. we all love hogwarts legacy.
there s more evidence in the original trilogy that luke is not gay than just the hologram scene in a new hope.  another example from a new hope  the scene in the cockpit of the falcon where luke and han are discussing leia.   so what do you think of her  han     i m trying not to  kid.    good.    you think a princess and a guy like me-    no. not to mention the kiss between luke and leia in empire  and luke s smug reaction to it afterward.
@taterboob  yes you do
there are also some canon comics where he falls in love with a girl
you mean before she was written in as his sister.
@ca he  mara jade
@solos hold  i said canon
@grasslander  maybe.  but maybe he d be drooling over the  big strong  manly storm troopers! ... i want some of that!!  maybe with something like    shoot me again!  harder!    not really joking. my daughter has a guy friend who is gay. the guy was helping me do some plumbing at a rental house. the tenant came to help.  the tenant is a fireman.  i was rolling my eyes because my daughter s friend was making eyes at the tenant whenever he had his back turned.
i hoped he never found out
he thought leia was a guy obviously
somehow  i always knew. leia s a freak.
yea luke s not gay. he s just from alabama
luke skywalker turned gay after he drank the alien titty milk. mark hammil turned gay after he drank the kool-aid.
oh  he knew alright.  that s just how he rolls.
@ca he  canon or disney canon
@rambleon07  disney canon  so they can t make him gay
@ca he  disney canon is about as consistent as a schizophrenic.
@rambleon07  i m just saying  it s another thing against them trying to make him gay  so probably it would be bi  like the did to tim drake and superman s son in dc
@stardust  what happens if luke ever kissed his brother if he had one   would that make him straight
but then he saw he way han looked at leia.... and his heart fluttered....
that s not even mention the attention he gave her in a new hope  and the jealousy when han said   do you think she could like a guy like me
lol ikr he straight up looked at han with a smile crossed his legs and put his hands behind his head.
so they make the eu  where he was with mara jade  non-canon then they want him gay. i m seeing the play. and they wonder why people don t like them.
exactly
the only way luke was  gay  was in the pre-millenial use of the word  meaning  lame .
@timmy turner  why do people keep forgetting bisexual and asexual  straight exist like it is always gay or lesbian
@jack m  truths
@the mighty fiction  truths
@taterboob  thankyou capt obvious
straight up hardon
shh disney gods are hearing you
a gay guy can still call a woman beautiful. but luke is most likely straight. but who the hell knows or cares. it s a made up character
@paul woodford  this goes back to the importance of stories for society and the human race. who cares about companies they re made up  someone decided to just create this idea of a company one day and offer people positions at this company that somebody just made up and offer paper money to pay these people  paper money that has a completely arbitrary value. why is one piece of paper valuable while another piece that looks almost identical to it is worthless  our society is flimsy and relies upon a kind of fiction that everyone agrees upon and you re trying to tell me that a made-up character s life doesn t have value even though a large portion of the world has already decided that his fictional life is valuable.
@polishtamales  so you are telling me luke actually like playing with the schwartz sabers.
disney s character.
you got the timeline backwards  he shot those rats before the wampa encounter.
reason why i always  separate the character from the actor  been doing  that ever since i saw whoopi goldberg turn to be  the exact opposite if  what she was  as guinan in star trek tng.ito me luke n skywalker  is straight  and  he  was a husband  and  a father and  nobody is ever going  to convince me  that it was ever different !
he is a disney character and he is a pansexual  gay  lesbian  nonbinary  trans female  jedi who is also a socialist. star wars died as soon as george lucas cashed it in. move on.
@vegitas4  can t blame him though. 4 billion dollars is a lot of money. i d cash in too
@jacob mcquaid  surely  that s worse if hamill said that after the womp rats line from the first movie.
good point
what i keep saying. espeically considering a lot of the crap that comes out of hamil s mouth  like his views and opinions of anyone that doesn t vote democrat are things that luke skywalker would not share. if anything mark has proven he is far closer to jake skywalker from tlj then he ever was to george lucas s luke from the ot.
i mean new hope isn t canon so who cares about that
@benlewis5312  you would . the ip of star wars is priceless  but george lucas made a stupid decision  giving it to disney.
if mara jade was a brunette she would ve been in the sequels as luke s girl boss dommy mommy lol
married mara jade and have children.
oh no. you may not know  but the fact is kathleen kennedy has been trying to figure out a way to bring in mara jade into her universe  but as an lgbtqptzmnosr-whatever-plus icon  completely removed from luke and company.  mind you  this is a crew that believes you can slow your descent by stick in a lightsaber into a wall and hanging on to the hilt of a lightsaber -- and they can t figure out how bring in mara jade as their  activist icon.
i just want star wars to die. because if they do bring mara jade into star wars she will not be married to luke. if she is married to luke they will probably make her trans! just let star wars die let it all die. pray they don t manipulate anime.although a lot of the tropes we see in modern pop culture has always been in anime. they just have better stories
100
he s also a working actor  he has notoriety but does he have enough money to retire  i think he s playing his cards so he can keep working.
mark is a actor a good one but a actor nonetheless he has no say in regards of who luke is luke was george lucas s character long before disney and as far as i m concerned the disney movies are just a bad dream luke leah and hon were having
@david p  i mean the actors playing a character  especially if they are a reoccurring character  do get some say into what the character is like adlibbing and all so if an actor that is the only one to of played the character says something about the character then they are mostly right in saying that.
@rockhopper_392  no  he belongs to george lucas  not disney.
@furyousd  tf do you mean  the first movie in the franchise isn t canon
@             wtf are u talking about  i am talking about the disney made movies  those aren t canon.
@furyousd  new hope is episode 4  1977   just so you know.
@matthew you can act without being sanctimonious about your political and religious beliefs.  plenty of people are working actors without being as pandering as hamill is.
at least we still have hogwarts legacy
there is a meme running around now  it shows peter griffin in an electric chair ready to be executed  the banner says 2030 and peter says something like i admitted i was straight.
@autoinfanticide  ehhhhhhh
@0xinternal  yeah that one. buying that game is a  win against wokeness   melonie says so  and i agree kappa
anyting but straight and anything--but white and male i m about 1 minute away from canceling my disney  account.
@milozion1525  should have canceled that ages ago.
..optimistic that there s even going to be a society at all in 10 years..
attacking straight people is their new trope
everyone too  because there will be absolutely no reason to not declare yourself at the top of the oppression totem  to get all the privileges.
@brian k  should be one minute past.
@autoinfanticide  so salty.
@john walker  im more disappointed that people who would claim to be anti-woke would fall victim to the overton window like this. youd have to be very young or very myopic to not know how woke jk rowling and harry potter truly are.
10 years is mighty generous. give it another 2-3  and it continues because we all keep giving our money to all the creators of entertainment who do this shit  instead of supporting indie small companies who don t hate us  or even creating our own .
breeders  will be attacked as selfish and the concept of a nuclear-family offensive.a brave new world
@autoinfanticide  how is hogwarts legacy a win against woke when that game itself is woke  lmao.
it ll be illegal to portray heterosexuality on screen in 10 years.
@zack fair  thats what melonie says!
they already want to make wolverine trans which is impossible due to his healing factor. if they go after peter parker it is over. i hope they don t go after miles morales either
good
not anime characters though
@zack fair  doesn t mean isn t good
@dashing daniel games  no  but it does mean the game would be better without the activist agendas.
that noise is dying down.  more and more people are realizing that  no... most people don t actually belong to the rainbow community.  babies are not all trans waiting to go on hormone blockers.  common sense is making a comeback.nearly ten years ago  a buddy of mine in the army was doing recruiting.  he found that more of those kids were less entitled and exhibiting more sense than millennials.  that was in iowa  though.  the midwest and bible belt are usually more down-to-earth  still instilling basic common sense and basic values in children.  people who held onto logic and common sense had to endure a storm and we re seeing the result of people holding onto sanity and the rainbow people will have to live with the fact that they are a minority.  study data and or census data shows they are less than 10  of the population.  at least that s my recollection.  i could be wrong about the numbers.  but  not by much.
@brian k you shouldve cancelled that years ago.
@beretta road chronicles  star wars  a new trope
@fugoff azshoel  straight wars a new trope
mark hamill  luke skywalker is gaythe joker  no he s not!
he didn t actually say luke is gay.
@youjgsousa  no  but everyone else is. and honestly  i will never agree to whatever narrative disney has for star wars  aside for the mandalorian and rogue one .
lol
when asked who is a strong woman in sw  that s not a skywalker by blood   mara jade is the first one we think of. badass redhead assassin wielding a purple saber  yeah  many of us discovered our type.
disney erasing mara jade from existence but keeping other legends characters such as thrawn is borderline criminal.
@david franz  they butchered thrawn  too.
@david franz  i heard lucas wanted their marriage disavowed  because he wanted luke to follow the jedi order s no relationship thingy. but kk hates mara jade and she can t overshadow her precious marey sue palpatine.
i have her action figure.
rip
thank you!!! i hate that disney threw all that content out the window and said  it isnt cannon.
i thought he only had one child  ben .  leia had 3  jacen darth caidus  jaina and anakin  and one granddaughter.  cade is a distant descendant of ben skywalker.
trying to make a comeback with wokeness just so he can make more money he is going broke
i m not sure about that. what seems to happen  a lot  is that mark s pretty open to discussions and sometimes wears his opinions on his sleeve. people get him to express those personal opinions and then they ll run with it as if he s making a declaration of canon. in the quote in the article listed  he was trying to make teens who come up and ask him specifically about luke feel better about themselves and then it gets taken as if mark was declaring luke to be gay as a matter of canon.yet they conveniently ignore him saying the last jedi was not luke skywalker and luke would never have done any of that.i think mark doesn t say and do and agree with whatever for relevance so much as he just says what he thinks and people look for a way to use that to their side of the culture war.
he s not a talented actor at all mate. he s a great voice actor for sure  but that s a completely different skillset. there s a reason harrison ford went on to superstardom and hamill didn t. just like carrie fischer he couldn t act
@ninjafox games   geekery  i see your point. it s like that time when a kid got beat up by some bullies  and it was said that the kid wouldn t fight back because  as he told the bullies  a jedi doesn t fight. mark told the kid he did the right thing and that he was right about the jedi  even though movies  books  comics  video games  and anything else with a jedi in it says different. so yeah  i think mark will say something just to try to make someone feel better.
@ben lewis  i completely agree with you. hamill always had bad on-screen presence. the reason star wars was successful is because the character was compelling and for the first episode  at least  it required naivete. by the time episodes ii and iii came around  everyone was fine with giving his lackluster acting a pass because they d become invested in the narrative and production overall.
@benlewis5312  how is mark hamill not a superstar
she was trapped headfirst in the dryer with her pants down.  duh!
or married and had a child with mara jade
facts  speedstreak
disgusting twisted versions  umm  i get the sentiment about people suddenly deciding to turn characters gay when it was never clear they were  but there s no need to label an entire group of innocent people who have done nothing to you like that.
disgusting indeed
he married mara jade they fell in love and luke converted an assassin who was sent to kill him to become a jedi and they had two children. this is official canon . what ryan johnson did was nonsense
@lobster shark  doesn t stop them from labeling an entire group of innocent people who have done nothing to them.
at this point  i m only interested in fan made content of any sort. i truly wish star wars license would go public so expanded universe is canon again and this disney crap will be irrelevant if need be.
@lobster shark  i don t think this person is talking about the entire gay community.  twisted versions  means turning white characters black and straight characters gay or bi  that kind of stuff  changing a character and making them unrecognizable. they never said anything about gay characters being disgusting and twisted.
@jayden hamilton  he implied it.
@dragon ball fans can t read  i don t see it.
@spartan300  actually luke and mara only had one child  ben skywalker. han and leia had 3 kids.
@spartan300  it was canon. not anymore .
@speedstreak cope
yup...mara jade...
yes mara jade and it s a great story   you need to read
in legends yep  even in disney canon he was established to be straight. kinda proves disney s canon is all over the damned place.
@kyle phantom  which i ve always found hilarious as one of the reasons disney said they were scrapping the old expanded universe was because they claimed it was all over the place and an inconsistent mess and wanted to start over again fresh with everything being interconected from the movies  tv shows  books  comics  video games you name it. i mean that was supposedly what that lucasfilm story group was put in place to oversee and yet like you said disney s continuity might honestly be just as bad if not worse then the old expanded universe s which was only because george lucas repeatedly said the eu was ulitmately secondary when it came to his overall vision for star wars. but with disney they told us everything was going to be connected no matter how small. what a bunch of complete horsecrap.
nothing outside the movies was ever actually canon  tho
@halford cincuentaysiete  my idiot detector went off  that is not correct.
thank you so much
which book
@rumple gold  just read the eu books in the old canon  starting with the thrawn trilogy. they re mostly great and eventually you ll get to the wedding and him being a father. but they re all way more star wars than anything disney will make
@vincent frigo  that makes  me a little sad because i was hoping luke was asexual like me . but i m he s straight
@rumple gold  if i remember correctly timothy zhan is the author for those books. he is the creator for admiral thrawn and mara jade.
@rumple gold  things we didn t need to know for  100 alex
eu is star wars to me. dismal studios is just a different universe all together and can fall into a sarlacc pot and die for all i care. too bad hamil didn t just stay out of it all together.
@rumple gold  lay off the soy
nahhhhhhh down with the friendzone...and it will be fine.
none of these people care about star wars or luke  they only want to irritate those that don t think like they do  and they perceive many of us as their enemies
the clown world keeps getting clown world-y-er  -- melonie mac 2023
it is so annoying how everything needs a label. the way people try to change established characters because reasons is just insane. i miss when things were normal.
when i see the term  bromance  used for characters such as frodo and sam  and the viewer believes them to be attracted to each other  i just know that the people who believe such things  have never experienced real friendship before. they can t fathom that there are friendships so strong that you d die for them and give them as much support as you possibly can. i highly doubt when mark hamill was playing luke that somewhere in his mind he was thinking  luke could go for some d  k right about now  he s a fraud  and he is a liar....and also a terrible actor.
the whole reason he went on his adventure in star wars is because he thought princess leia was hot.
i m lgbt  myself  but making a character gay 10 years later or some other ridiculous amount is just insulting and stupid  you can t just say a character is gay to get social points  i also don t like the fact that it s so surprising  it adds to the fact that being lgbt  is some big special thing about people  when we re just regular people who happen to be attracted to different people.    show me a character is lbgt  don t tell me  if you aren t showing it you don t need to tell me because it adds nothing.
so  if i write a short-story in which luke and mara jade have a weekend getaway on naboo  is he straight again
i d guess george lucas would be able to answer this since he created luke.
funny because he said in an interview back during last jedi  mark hamill did mentioned luke getting married to mara jade and having a son
wait  why didn t my parents tell me about this   they stood in line for hours all night in a crummy area to see these movies in the theatres and they never told me this was the main plot
next will be he she they
...they keep making up more and more things toddlers are like that. they keep pushing the boundaries of their parents  patience  until a parent upends them and spanks their behinds.this is going to keep happening until we push back  and then they ll point and condemn our intolerance.except  by that time it will have gotten so bad  we won t care.
i considered making a film movie story with memorable and engaging stories  strong character writing and arcs but i realized that the lgbt mafia will highjack and ruin that so i never did. it s quite upsetting
it s so sad to see likeable actors to become like this.
hamil loves the fame and money the character has brought to him but i m sure he has grown to hate luke over time.
in legends cannon luke was definitely not gay he had a wife and a son.
mara jade  am i a joke to you
i always did not care about how much mark preached online because i never heard him treat fans and the ips he was involved in wrong. sad that this is the straw that broke the back for him and his character luke i thought he would defend against weirdos online who can t help themselves.
i d love to hear george lucas  opinion on this.
mara jade will always be canon in my heart.
in short  these are people who ve never been in the trenches together.
nah  even if you don t have an agenda  sometimes  you just got to wonder. i mean  if you watched xena  warrior princess back in the  90s  you knew people were wondering whether xena and gabrielle were doing more than they were willing to show on camera.
actually  luke was going back to the farm when he discovered the stormtroopers were after the droids. then back at the farm  he discovered that his aunt and uncle had been murdered by the empire. that s when luke decided to go to alderaan with obi-wan. while he was on the death star  though  i m sure the reason he wanted to save princess leia from execution is because he thought she was hot.
@gabriel  from the movie leia  hologram   help me  obi-wan kenobi. you re my only hope.luke  what s this artoo whistlesthreepio  what is what !  he asked you a question...  pointing to leia  what is that leia  hologram   help me  obi-wan kenobi. you re my only hope. help me  obi-wan kenobi. you re my only hope.threepio  oh  he says it s nothing  sir. merely a malfunction. old data. pay it no mind.luke  who is she  she s beautiful.threepio  i m afraid i m not quite sure  sir.leia  hologram   help me  obi-wan kenobi...threepio  i think she was a passenger on our last voyage. a person of some importance  sir -- i believe. our captain was attached to...luke  is there more to this recording luke reaches out to artoo who beeps indignantly  threepio  behave yourself  artoo. you re going to get us in trouble. it s all right  you can trust him. he s our new master.artoo whistles and beepsthreepio  he says he s the property of obi-wan kenobi  a resident of these parts. and it s a private message for him. quite frankly  sir i don t know what he s talking about. our last master was captain antilles  but with what we ve been through  this little r2 unit has become a bit eccentric.luke  obi-wan kenobi  i wonder if he means old ben kenobi threepio  i beg your pardon  sir  but do you know what he s talking about luke  well  i don t know anyone named obi-wan  but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea. he s kind of a strange old hermit.luke looks at the imageluke i wonder who she is. it sounds like she s in trouble. i d better play back the whole thing.threepio  he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. he suggests that if you remove the bolt  he might be able to play back the entire recording.luke  h m  oh  yeah  well  i guess you re too small to run away on me if i take this off! okay.luke removes the restraining bolt and the hologram of leia disappears luke  there you go. well  wait a minute. where d she go  bring her back! play back the entire message.thus  luke removes artoo s restraining bolt  which allows artoo to escape into the desert. luke the next morning takes off after artoo. had he not removed the restraining bolt  he would have never left and would have been killed by the stormtroopers who tracked artoo to his uncles farm  as obi-wan said to him .so  i ll stand by my statement. if luke didn t get the hots for leia  he would have never gone on the adventure  but would have been killed by stormtroopers.
incest  not gay
@rob roskey  in his defense  he didn t know leia was his sister.
this still blows my mind considering the company who made her.but tracer is a good example because her reveal that s she s a lesbian came a comic  and it wasn t some grand reveal  just a last minute surprise and in game she doesn t mention she s a lesbian at all  she s too busy being goofy.
for real. i don t see how the community can celebrate things like this. its virtue signaling pandering to the fullest. seems like people cant even tell when they are being taken advantage of and it is sad. it s belittling.
it s not ten years  it s after decades of established canon about the character by the creator himself.
straight guy here agreeing with this main comment.
yes.also   lucas  -  luke .  is hamill making a dig at george
they had actually two children a son and a daughter . and mara jade was a top imperial assassin who was sent to kill luke they did fight and eventually fell in love and had even a jedi wedding . it was kk and lucas film that made luke into this hermit who never had a wife. but in canon jedis could and did marry and have children
ford didn t bother to hide his hatred of han solo.
the last jedi scarred him. mark only sees jake skywalker now.
she took that personally
if they introduce her  she s gonna be gay. bet on it.
@film grouch  played by that one red headed african girl disney put in all their stuff recently who can t act
it s unfortunate indeed. mark seems to have really invested himself into this cult though and he s probably got people in his ear making him think having his most iconic character slam dudes is actually a virtuous thing.
it would be his standard  i  ve lost control of the franchise  response. hopefully rumors that disney is trying to sell the franchise are true and he can get it back.
luke is not gay. hey melonie. happy valentines day. god please bless melonie today
lusting after princess leia from the second he saw her hologram tells me not gay.
he went full  pre based  jk rowling
hope you re having a happy valentine s day! you ve done lots of great things on your go boom channel  saying what needs to be said and brushing off the hate. just know that no matter how many haters you get  love is stronger than hate and we all love you! have a fantastic day and love the video as always.
mark hamill is a complete and utter maroon.
if mr. money man says luke is gay then mark hamill will say he is gay if mr. money man says luke is straight then mark hamill will say he is straight.
i just roll my eyes when actors start talking about unwritten beliefs or tendencies of characters their play  same thing when elija woods started talking about frodo being pro trans or whatever the hell that was about. these are red flags  someone needs to collect mark hamill and put him into psychiatric evaluation because clearly he s lost his ability to track the divide between reality and fiction and is being psychologically overtaken by the ego of a role he played at one point.
there s no way luke skywalker could be a pillow biter.
this is why we can t have nice things
bet mark wishes his son was so he wouldn t have had to demand the girlfriend to kill his future grandchild because he was afraid she would get his money.
i guess we are just forgetting luke married mara jade.
a better question is  who is still straight  the answer would be a lot shorter
i love how chill your cat is.
mara jade is luke s true love interest
how long until harrison ford says the same about indiana or han
luke is definitely not gay  he just kissed his sister and took it like a champ
ahhh...so all of that awkward battle between han and luke over leia must have been imagined in my mind then.
ive never thought luke skywalker was gay but always thought mark hamill was.
melonie i have been aware of you for some time now but only recently started following you. i just want to say that in this mad world you are like a breath of fresh air. dont ever stop going boom!
he s trying to get uncanceled for liking jk rowling s tweet.
i like mark hamill because of his legendary joker history  he s been the best at that but i wish he would open his eyes and stop pandering.
@lvthor ascending amen to that
@lvthor ascending  except he wasn t acting as the joker he s that crazy
@jonathan devereaux  it appears so
@the mighty crixus  dude i m one of her mods. i literally have conversations with her all the time. so get over yourself
nevermind... there is no chance in heaven or hell
melonie mac i  m you darling laurence ernst alias laurene ernst alias laurence cordier gwendoline merlin future  pouse laurence ernst idem and patrice ernst idem and elise easieforever idem and  gwendolinecordier idem you are all my d esses and darling
something tells me that disney made him say it somehow.
@aaron p.  nah
@conscious gentile  whether they did or not  as an actor myself  i know that actors don t get to say random bullshit about characters they play nor should they  so it really doesn t mean much. that s the writer and sometimes the directors job.
when the check clears
everybody knows luke s all about that wincest.
not even george takai went that direction when it came to sulu.
you came in that thing  you re braver than i thought  oh...so leia was actually talking about chewie...
had never heard of your channel. youtube was nice enough to recommend it to me and i have to say after watching three of your videos  i m impressed and believe we agree. keep upntje great content and btw subscribed!
it s honestly whatever fits their narrative for the day
may the force be with they them
happy valentines keep up the good work
i don t mind if characters are gay  i don t like when an established character is retroactively changed to be so  especially in this case where lucas  the creator  had no say. i understand you could make the argument that he doesn t own star wars anymore  and you d be correct  but he  among a few other talented folks  still made the character of luke  and i would argue back that their opinion matters still. therefore  i personally believe that unless lucas says it was planned  luke is unable to be retroactively gay.i m sorry if this is a long comment  but thank you if you took the time to read it and have a blessed day
the male gaze literally started star wars.luke   we gotta save the princess.  she s purty.
he wasn t gay  but after discovering that he made out with his twin sister  he was traumatized and went the other direction because every time he kissed a girl after that he couldn t help himself and would blurt out   that was great  but my sister is hotter!
brings a whole new meaning to  han shot first   doesn t it
just hamill trying to make up for his unforgivable crime of liking one of jk rowling s tweets.
you didn t see the extended extended cut when chewie gave luke his red rocket in the back of the millennium falcon.
mr. hamil had my deepest sympathies with the way that his legacy of luke was pissed away by the sequel trilogy.  now he is doing the same with his own esteem in my eyes.
i literally am extremely critical of any movies or shows i watch  i m almost to the point of rather to watch not a thing due to the identity politics and levels of wokeness
luke might be considering it after finding out the girl he tongue wrestled once was his sister.
for anyone that wonders  the article clickbaited melonie and us and mark hamil didn t actually say that luke is gay.
some people are worried about ai and  deep fakes  and stuff.  i like your intros which are professional  punchy  draw us in  but not perfect -- human in a very good way. have a great evening melonie
sam mags...never found a franchise they didn t want to wreck.
luke had a wife in the books written long before woke disney took over. her name was mara jade skywalker.  and in the books also ben skywalker was their son. tired of them trying to change classics just to please less than one percent of the worlds population.  wookipedia even added pronouns to the character info...they had anakin as she her the other day  but i guess they changed it back to he him.
and that situation with sulu being gay is still fixable and could be retconned.
woke wash  white wash  black wash  ect... are just insulting. it reeks of just corporate greed of selling skin dlc instead of creating something new
@jess horn  honestly yes  all of the  buzz terms  could be summarized as  corporate greed . i agree with you  we should just call it what it is. i just wish more people could wake up to the fact that they don t really care about their identities and just want to take advantage of them for their money
right   my favorite character from the office is oscar  and he s gay. but he was written like that. retroactively turning every classic character from popular ip s gay is just bizarre  unnecessary  and creatively lacking.
@jacey king  great example! modern hollywood  take note!
same with gaming for me  like dead space remaster and forspoken  and even hogwarts legacy...
@zurvanlol    dead space really  dead space went woke
@jimmy pena  the remaster switched a lot of characters and made afaik a crew member into lesbian and isaacs wife is now ugly and old.
someone watched friday night tights last week when they meme-deepfaked az.
apparently they never listened to the audio dramas either. luke was very happy about getting kissed in a new hope before swinging to the other side of the corridor.
happy valentines day to ypu. even though i believe that valentines day is everyday or should be everyday especially if you re in a relationship because love should be celebrated everyday not just once a year. but you deserve to have that kind of love and you deserve to have the best valentines day possible. always remember that you re a star and a diamond in human form and the best continual valentines day gift ever. have a beautiful day
omg i love your commentary !! dying laughing always!!
legends  100  straight as an arrow  mara jade s lover  and a great teacher.canon  who knows  cause he s garbage  cranky  angry  and drinks green milk.
as a genuine 100  authentic gay i can tell you that luke is not gay. his whole backstory doesn t have an ounce of gayness in it. also thanks melonie for calling out the q. i absolutely hate the word queer it is a slur and anyone who calls themselves that is just saying they re very messed up in the head.
i think he s trying to put his real life feelings onto the character luke.
no matter how much of an adrenaline junkie someone is  they re still going to have a sex drive  especially with someone who s really physically strong  healthy  and physically active like lara croft.so maybe a romantic relationship wouldn t make sense necessarily  but a physical one  i don t see why that wouldn t be in line with lara s character.
anakin s suffering is neverending...
last i checked  luke wasn t hormonally driven to rescue a captured prince.
6 films and 46 years later he decides that luke is gay. seems totally legit.
luke was married  mara jade  and had a son  named ben. that s canon to me. none of this other crap.malonie look beautiful. i hope you have a good day. and  biggitarmay take care melonie.
i m convinced that mark hamill actually believes he is the joke and just wants to see the world burn. of course the only thing it burns is his image and disney s
happy v-day melonie!  i hope you liked my special steak recipes i posted in a thanks in your last video  xd   anyway  i gotta correct you all on lukes pronouns  he identifies as x-wing   y-wing.     he swings all ways like a   b-wing assault fighter  because.... lets face it   mara jade in disney wars is brie larson  which is why he craked and went full  jgtow   jedi going their own way.     instead of getting space gandalf  brie turned him into richard simons skywalker.
i read 9 different star wars books story lines in none was he gay.in one han solo and leia s son killed luke s wife which was a ex sith assassin.  if anyone knows what star wars books that is please let me know would love to reread them . in all but 1 he got married in that one  he was near death though the whole story line.i also liked the one that han and leia and luke and his wife both had twins one boy and one girl. in that one both of han and leia s kids went to the dark side and the female twin of luke s and his wife.  luke s daughter killed her mom as part of her transformation to the dark side.
luke s not gay  he just has confusing feeling for his sister.
we can t have straight characters anymore can we  no better question we can t have good things anymore can we
hey melonie. have a great valentines day. you look stunning today
they should have had luke married with alot of kids since he was raised an only child it would make sense  and it would have made for a much funner movie in my opinion  thanks melanie happy valentine s day!
i thought the destruction of luke was done in 2017.now here we are..
he was saying if you are gay and pretending to be luke he is gay. it s about who you are. i pretend to be luke and suddenly he not only kisses his sister but also... uh better not say. i assume if a gay person or a woman pretends to be luke then... uhh i wouldn t know.. you get the idea. pretending to be luke is for everyone
how can you be gay  girls are so hawt
you tip a dollar really dude
@jonathan sanders   yuuuup!  my tips change time too time if i feel like tipping xd
@lancer737  come on bro can t be cheap for you re girl.
@jonathan sanders    what
they don t want to be involved the materials or the stories  they just want to ship people rwby in a nutshell
once luke had his first kiss he new he was never gay again
i m a lesbian and i didn t need anyone to tell me my sexuality i figured that shit out myself as all kids should be able to do
i m in my 40 s and i always thought luke was a little light in the loafers but then i was always a hans fan.
after thinking about it more  i m actually okay with this. because as far as i m concerned there are two luke s  the extended universe luke  the true canon or  legends   and disney s. eu luke  is a legendary  jedi grand-master who successfully reformed the jedi order  he is a leader  a warrior  a protector  and a devoted family-man  he is a father and husband to a bad-ass and beautiful woman  named mara-jade.this is our luke. disney made it painfully clear  that they don t want anything to do with this version of him or the eu. and y know what  we re more than happy to take them.meanwhile  disney s luke is gay... and lived the rest of his life as a miserable hermit  who abandoned his friends  family  the galaxy and his duties  allowing an evil force to rise up and wreak havoc upon countless innocence  and by the end  dies alone and a failure... well done  disney! well done!
man lukes wife is going to be mad .
to be fair  he does like to play with swords a lot.
things are very strange these days. thank you for the information.
nah . luke is super straight
if i recall correctly  mark hammil tried to fight against luke skywalker no longer being luke skywalker but then it looked like he pissed someone off cuz there was a certain moment you could tell he didn t care anymore and was saying whatever he was told to say  and did so in a way that screamed   i don t care. i hope you see thru this. this is so stupid. i want to go back to batman.  look at the early interviews if the last trilogy and you can see how he changed during the pt campaign  first talking out against ryan j  then sarcastically saying   oh no  he s amazing! this was a great idea! it s brilliant!
mark hamill will say anything that keeps him relevant
mark hamill   luke skywalker is gay. mara jade   allow me to introduce myself.
there goes his relationship with mara jade. and yes. i know they said that wasn t cannon.
isn t it interesting how they always have to try to change pre-existing characters instead of making their own
lol seriously  smh not so surprising really oh yeah happy birthday to lara croft
mark hamill says jedi wouldn t just give up and was overruled.  who is she  she s beautiful.    not  gay. grooming going on here. happy valentine s day  melonie!  you look beautiful. god bless
if disney gives luke skywalker a rainbow light saber i m never watching star wars ever again
my second oldest is named after mara jade. and luke and obi-wan were my two favorite characters. these  woke   more like comatose  are really trying to mess up all the great characters from my childhood.
i don t understand kk s hatred for this character but since she s been in control there has been a consistent attempt to deconstruct luke so it s not a surprise someone would write something like this. hamill seems to  need the work so of course he s going along with it.
luke definitely isn t gay...he never has been
you mean you didn t have a teacher put rainbow flags everywhere and act like a fool embarrassing the class talking about stuff nobody asked about
and you don t need to tell us you re lesbian
@e-satan  for this conversation i think it s relevant  also i want people to know that not all lgb people are batshit crazy
another creep
i ve been wondering why the eu books did not get adapted to films  will they have big issues with the eu writers
hey melonie  you might want to check out revy from black lagoon  she seems to match your old description of lara croft a lot closer than what they ve done to lara recently.
honestly  i never read the books  watched star wars for the first time as a teen  and yeah i kinda got the vibe
happy birthday classic lara croft.classic lara croft is m.i.a but i hope she is still being her classic badass psychopathic gravel robbing self.
after what they ve done to his character in the sequel trilogy hamill can call luke anything he wants  from gay to flying shish qebab.p.s. but mara jade skywalker would be pissed...
so luke has psychological trauma from romantic interest in his own twin.
no no no hell no.
in june 2022. basically  we just made it up so it can be possible  about the dumbledore thing.  i don t understand why people keep saying that jk  retcon  him. firstly  it was never specify that dumbledore was straight and honestly never seemed that way. i ve read the books like 20 times. and reading the latest  that you spend time with him. a friend of mine and me would joke  gaaayyy  at some of the things. and when we read the last book  which i still remember going to the midnight event in borders for it s release  had a blast that day.  when we read it  when we start picking up on the story between him and grindelwald.  we were like  o.o i think he really is gay  and have a thing for grindelwald   however  it always seemd like a one way thing.  like dumbledore had a crush and grindelwald didn t even noticed it. or was just to focus in  their mission   and remember that it s not that jk make a big announcement.   she basically outed dumbledore when one of the writer director. wanted for there to be a scene in wish dumbledore tell harry the story about a girl he liked.   and jk returned the script with a note   that couldn t happened because dumbledore was gay   that was all. it was the media that decided to make a circus out of it. and later jk said that if she would ve know that he been gay would ve been received so well she would ve said it earlier.  so she knew  as his creator  but it wasn t public knowledge because it wasn t relevant to the story.   like most writers  they know things of their characters that they don t put in their books because it s not relevant.  it did not need to be hinted anywhere.  this is personal information.  and is not just personal  it s in a way  of sexual nature.  it will be like wondering which of the hp characters  erm...  self love  . and how they go about it giving their living circumstance.  but that s like  ugh  no  no one wanna know about that.  but the reality is  you have hundreds of hormonal teenagers  you can not tell me that at least one of them did not.  but its just  not something that should be a subject of conversation  period.
the animorphs community has a massive amount of these cult-like people. constantly trying to rewrite the characters as members of the lgabcjs community.somebody once said that a character was  unofficially but canonically bisexual.  i pointed that out  and they retracted  but it just showed me how they approach these things...
i say this as an actor...actors do not get to say some random bullshit about the characters as fact  that is the writers and maybe the directors job.
hearing this  i suddenly feel a whole lot less sorry for what the last jedi did to mark hamill. he deserves it.  not luke  but mark.
for people who hate it when the story is focusing on a girl sex those same people really want to know what dude is blowing who
melonie are you taking a break on social media
let s just pretend the incestuous sexual tension he had for years with leia didn t exist
he was interested in his sister  if he hadn t stopped himself when he realized that they were siblings then he would have fit perfectly into the woke mob.
getting gay with kids is here!  -southpark  1999
i m glad i m not gay  melonie you look gorgeous as usual!!
he s only doing this because he got canceled for liking a jk rowling tweet plain and simple
since everyone that s trying to change main characters sexuality  let s take a know gay character and make them straight and christian
only george lucas knows  given the year it was written   it s highly unlikely lucas even considered the sexual orientation of any of his characters.
most of the eu writers weren  t even paid royalties for their hard work following the lucas film acquisition. disney just doesn t care about them.
there is no ben solo  there is however a jacen and jana solo and an anakin solo.
she had to visit family and she back now.
lame but good try.
this. and let s race swap all the popular black characters. it s only fair!
i mean cyberpunk already did that  make judy bisexual lol i play on pc so
@crystalx oof  i was kinda talking about a character as big as luke skywalker  but it s the same idea.
hamill   of course luke is gay  how has no one notice mara jade   am i a joke to you
mark hamill  luke skywalker is gayme  luke is alabaman
in the legends continuity  luke was married... with children!  roll the tv theme and imagine luke on the couch giving away money to mara and ben
he actually mentioned it  was possible  luke might actually be gay back in like 2014  2015  but then went on to say  he s not.
guess finally finding out your crush was actually your sister does a lot to a man. but  reading the books of the new jedi order he really loved his wife which i heard from people that read the books before tried to kill him. those two might have been a deciding factor to go to the rainbow side.
i mean  i see how people can be confused but really luke is actually just involuntarily you know... the thing.
mara was one of the better additions of the eu and i thought would ve played a big part when the sequel trilogy was announced. disney did her dirty
look at me i am still relevant and cool.
wtf are they talking about  luke was feeling competitive with han over leia. in fact when han picked up on the fact that luke had the hots for the princess he started pretending to be intrested in her too just to wind luke up.
they do this for two reasons 1. to get that sweet esg money2. to generate pointless controversy so they can make themselves seem lik the victims
to be fair  i think i would rather he be gay than be kissing his sister xd but honestly i think luke can represent all of us. if a gay guy wants to see him as gay  sure why not  but i agree  i think its just an easy way for woke points.
this does explain a lot about him and yoda
remember in the eu luke went on to marry mara jade and have a son  along with restoring the jedi order and his bloodline continuing to live on for another century or so  good times.
melonie  great work as always  i m turning this video off early or i ll actually go boom. it genuinely enrages me  these people have hijacked my favorite ip. i was reading about luke marrying mara jade in my study hall in 2003 to the detriment of my social life. something that made me  weird  in high school being stolen and changed. yet if i get mad and tell someone they re  i m the bigot  or insert ist ir phone word here. i m so sick of this shit.
red foreman did called luke a  little fruit cake  lol
mark hamill is out of his mind... lol
melonie outraged as usual about irrelevant stuff.i m legit waiting for her eventual natsoc arc.
theres a difference between  luke is gay  and  can luke be gay   of course  the woke mob doesnt seek such a middle ground
happy valentines day. appreciate the content.
was it really a sweaty romp in the swamp that killed yoda  he looked pretty winded when he died and i think i saw him wink at luke as a force ghost... this is just mark hamill making up for his jk rowling incident.
what
she did  she didn t really know him so well at the time lol. it s been a while but from what i remember part of the dynamic is that he was relatively.. understanding  stoic  in the face of her animosity. i really need to reread those books.
well it was an accident. he had no way of knowing.
@the mighty crixus  and she kissed him  to piss off han.
@thatharvguy  exactly
@the mighty crixus  to be fair  it was not written in the script at that time but in universe i feel its still gross and sucks. similar to situations where brother and sister marry but don t realize they were related. still sucks and still gross i don t blame them for it but incest not great.
thank you so much!
so luke is a sith lord now  right
i m surprised he didn t mentioned darth vader being gay
just gotta say    get em ms meloni.. tear that ass up on the b.s the   the fandom menace is everywhere..
to be fair  leia kissed luke  and she did so only to spite han.
mark doesnt care anymore lol. he was visible upset in interviews about what they did to lukes character in ep. 7-8. my take away from his statement about luke being gay was  hes gay if you want him to be i dont care  harrison ford was tired of playing han solo so he asked to be killed lol. facts look it up.
interesting. i think you are right that gaming has been dumbed down because it got more popular and attracted more idiots non-gamers. makes sense. it certainly has been dumbed down thats for sure. that remark about cutscenes and  movie like games  is definitely true and the reasoning might be as well.
me  if luke skywalker is gay  then i m a purple horned elephant from pluto.mark hamill  he is gay. believe it.me  well  f ck me. i guess i really am a purple horned elephant from pluto.joker  and don t call me puddin !
making new characters is hard! absconding with other peoples ip and changing it is so much easier!
this is why he was the actor not the writer
mac as always you make some solid and interesting points in your analysis of this topic. i don t see it as definitive as you perhaps do. i feel like mark hamill is simply suggesting that it s okay for people to envision and interpret characters however they choose in a creative work. we know that luke was never portrayed as a gay character. mark is saying that if a kid sees a hero as representing their own personality more in their imagination  they are free to imagine it. i agree that we need to be careful about what we do and don t consider canon. but i think when it comes to imagination we shouldn t limit ourselves. great video as always. happy valentine s day to you and your loved ones.
mark hamill is not luke skywalker. he just happened to play the character. people need to remember this.
if i kissed my sister i d probably turn gay too.
me at 10 50 - glad i saw captain kirk s response - and good on him
i portrayed captain hook in a skit back in summer camp. i m going to go ahead and say he s gay  too.
so let s just ignore decades of canon that disney decided to sweep aside where luke is married to mara jade...with kids and everything.
they will never acknowledge mara jade. not only was she a straight  sexy and strong female character but she was also a red head....that s the disney kill zone right there lol
interesting since he was enamored by seeing princess leia  who was his sister.
mark hamill will say whatever he can to try and stay relevant.  he doesn t even play the character anymore  respeecher does
me at 7 40 - oh  and happy birthday lara croft
we re not surprised.  whatever happened after rian johnson s film  it broke mark hamill completely.  mark hamill was admitted a leftist  but still had sensibilities about him. if you recall  hamill spoke out against many choices force on the character of luke skywalker.  who is this guy   this isn t luke skywalker!  i had to call him jake skywalker!   but shortly afterwards  he changed his tune entirely. people commented how dead his eyes looked afterwards. go look at interviews back then. after three months after  whoever or whatever got their way into mark hamill gutted him entirely. and now   well  i m going to paraphrase mark hamill himself.  who is this guy!  this isn t mark hamill!  i had to call him bark hamill!  bark  hamill! bark!  masters are cracking the whip on you now.   p.s. i still respect the original mark hamill. i stand firm with that. wherever you are  original mark hamill  we could really use you again.
wiz and boomstick in response  i m pretty sure we researched luke skywalker when we pit him against the boy who lived. . . . .. . . .and last we checked  he s married to a lady named mara
someone wants to join luke s dark side
actually  luke married mara jade. the wedding of luke skywalker and mara jade took place in 19 aby on coruscant  shortly after the end of the galactic civil war. and also a son with her  named ben.
luke is gayme   remembers the scene of han solo taking the piss out of luke by pretending he might be interested in leia just to see his reaction
he didn t know leia was his sister at the time  but luke clearly was attracted to her when they first met.  luke skywalker is not gay.
luke   mara jade forever. that s still the true canon to me  no matter what disney says.
he said he wasn t gay a few years back
disney   hollywood are killing all of our favorite franchises...
wtf....so he just wanted to kiss his sister for kicks
people are so obsessed about sexuality because nowadays sexuality love. so if someone is interested if this character is gay  he she is interested if the character can have the same love story as the one who watches the show plays the game whatever. it s not about sex. it s about love.
too bad everyone s forgotten about mara jade...
please tell me he s gay. so you just want him to be gay  not that he actually is.
mark is confusing the character with himself.
luke  i had a wife in the eu.mark hamill  luke is clearly gay.
love your voice melonie!
literally the second luke sees leia in r2 s projector  he s like   who is she  she s beautiful.  people who actually think luke is gay isn t a fan of star wars. only george lucas knows what his characters are like. and yes  why are so many people obsessed with a character s sexual orientation these days  who they sleep with isn t important as long as the characters and stories are enjoyable
idk man luke always sounded fruity to me
i think mara would disagree. i think mark is trolling us. lol
it s sadly official  disney said so .
so what s the next thing that han solo and chewbacca were lovers
wasn t luke skywalker married to mara jade and they had a son together  it s been a while since i ve delved into the star wars lore  but i seem to remember this bit.
unless george lucas says he is  no he isn t.
i ll be honest hes on par with he-man
tpg owns the company that owns the investment firm that bought wookeepedia. wookeepedia is not the fandom  its owned by the company fandom. luke on the bright side  is a short story published in the stories of jedi and sith short-story collection. the story was written by sam maggs  illustrated by jake bartok  and published on  june 7  2022 . the story is told in the first person with two alternating points-of-view  those of luke skywalker and rey  hollis.and  luke on the bright side   written by sam maggs and published in june 2022 in stories of jedi and sith  an anthology book marketed towards  children ages 9-12 .
i feel like when someone makes this argument its only because the character isn t a horn dog  as though the only way to be straight as a  man is to be either  a sex pest or a sex work addicted consumer
is there a scene that was cut in the movies where  luke and han got drunk on mandalorian meed  and played hid the wookie !
you know who isn t gay me!nudge  nudge  wink  wink. have a great chocolate day!
just make all characters bi    can luke be into men  maybe. but from the fact that he falls for his siter  before he knows she is his sister  and have kissed her romanticly kinda points towards him definitly being into women   _   _
homoerotic fanfiction turned into cannon.
hands-off  one of  my childhood icons heroes lbtgtqgbq.........
mark hamill will say whatever the machine wants him to say for head pats.
don t matter what mark hamill says.as long as george lucas don t say he s gay  he s not gay.
judge luke by his character  but not who he loves. interestingly enough all those nutjobs tend to be the vilest  most entitled and most intolerant crowd.luke is a great character  heroic character  straight character. this perverted tainted version is not someone i would like to cross paths with in the dark.
hamill s deep in the cult
there would have been a strong argument to make jedi like luke  asexual  or what ever.. in fact mark always said luke was a virgin because of the jedi code.   but no..they just want to corrupt everything...
we should start a betting pool on what original character these clowns are going to  woke  next.
holy smokes  your cat is huge. i thought it was a coat layin there and it got up and walked away.
literally the reason why luke went with obi-wan to save leia was cause he thought she was hot. luke is not gay.
i m not a he they i m a he-man by the power of grayskull i have the powerrrrr!!!!
man  they really hate mara jade.
so kissing leia turned luke gay did it   what powerful women disney s princesses are. now in true disney style there can be a movie where leia sings about what she wants and how she wishes things would be. as small sub-plot  luke can dance in tights and sing about how great he is while he fights with his light saber
vader   search your feelingsluke   nooooooooooooooooooooooooo.........................
an actor can t say what his or her character s sexuality is  that s reserved for the creator
i learned a new word today  clownerier. i shall use this well.
he most certainly isn t  i even read one of the new canon books where luke definitely has feelings for a girl
my only childhood idol that didn t disappoint me when i grew up was jason david frank. mark hamill went from someone i wanted to meet to someone i hope i never cross paths with. he s as deranged of a leftist as you can get  and i ve given up on him.
prediction  they re going to claim you have to be homosexual to be a jedi.
in my opinion people need to watch the source interview. 6 years ago  oxford union  mark hamill adressed if luke was gay or not.  if you see him as gay  he s gay! if you see him as straight  he s straight!  it is a schrodinger s cat situation! until you open the box  he is both gay and not gay at the same time! and whatever people claim  it has never been opened yet. and i hope lucasfilm is so smart that they never will open that box.edit  oxford union  not oxford university.
oh god  lul welp there goes my childhood
mark trying to get some woke points
i d love to hear george lucas  take on current star wars as if he had full unconsequential free speech on the matter.
nothing made luke skywalker s live tragic but disney
they hijack established properties and characters because of their built in audiences.  it makes it easier for them to push their nonsense.  i m glad to see people like you trying to speak up for properties they care about.  less and less people willing to do that these days.
luke is gaysees the extended universethey lied to me!
ws struting in like a badass
like i told my fam gid didnt send kids to learn the lgbt s he sent them to learn their abc s
short answer  no. he isn t.hamill stating that nonsense is the same as leia kissing luke  the latter of which was solely done to make han solo jealous  nothing more  and that is his words meaning absolutely nothing and holds no water. xd
lmao  i guess mara jade is just a girlfriend from the comics
thats exactly the point. if they made new characters who were different races or lgbt  no one would be offended  and no one would care. so they change existing ones for attention like a teenager getting tattoos and nose piercings to upset their parents.
i use to look up to mark hamill as luke skywalker as star wars as a fan. luke isn t gay  wasn t gay in the books  had a son in the cannon stories with a woman. it s just like they did with velma. made her black and lesbian.
happy valentines day  by the way! i hope you have a great day
mark hammil will say anything to please hollywood.
i don t understand why we need to know every detail about a fictional characters sexuality these days
i always thought luke was the devoted celibate monastic type  and not a rav ing ....
i identify as a wookie because of my hairy back.  but then again i m not as tall as a wookie should be so maybe i m a tall ewok.   but then again i m getting kinda big these days so maybe i ll shave and identify as a gamorean guard.  but i like eating bacon sooooo.   gosh darn it star wars i can t identify with none of your characters in a galaxy far far away.   get on it!!!
what a great way to finish sw after the kk debacles.
this reminds me of the jedi temple sex scandal skit from chappelle s show for some reason.
two words   mara jade.  i ll always consider the timothy zahn trilogy more canon than disney s.
makes sense he found out the first girl he kissed was his sister. that would turn most men gay.
all do respect  i don t know what you have against ships. have you seen the star destroyer  it s a pretty cool ship.
they re probably going to try and head-canon it that after leia kissed him in empire  he realised he was gay.the correct response to that rubbish statement would be something along the lines of  no. he realised he wasn t a weirdo hillbilly that didn t want to breed with his own sister  regardless of whether he knew she was or not.
obi wan told him he has a sister. he didn t mention a brother. after kissing his sister he didn t know was his sister he lost his mind and decided only to hook up with guys in case there s another sister out there that he learns about after they share a cigarette.duh.
i knew it  i friggin knew it!  ever since i saw tlj i knew he was a skin flute player!
happy valentine s day melonie!
luke skywalker in the legends continuity definitely isn t gay. other than mara jade  he dated had romantic interest with 9 other women.
i can t wait in the future  when someone writes a character that is pure straight  to be called stunning and brave. because that s the clown world we re heading towards.
and so him being married to mara jade and having kids with her was what  just a convincing beard
he isn t gay. in the books  he was even married to mara jade skywalker. hammel is just doing whatever he can for the wokes praises.
i think he meant gray grey.  pretty sure luke was married and had a son in the books back in the day.  hell he was even thinking about banging his sister.  now if they want to go woke with luke then we can cancel them too.
mark is just too smart. of course luke is gay. he s anything you want him to be. mark doing front flips over traps like his still training with yoda on dagobah.
just when you thought you couldn t be more disappointed in hamill  he wokes his way into disappointing you further. not mad  not even surprised  it s just boring and predictable at this point.
i wonder what george lucas thinks of all of this.
threepio seemed like a flamer if any of the characters were.
wait... happy birthday to the real lara croft    wasn t her birthday last fall   we all cheered and stuff...
man i ve tried being inclusive but i genuinely get super annoyed at the alphabet community. they really are extreme narrsacist and demand everyone bend to their will.
luke is not gay and never will be cause even though leia was his sister  he proudly enjoyed the kiss she gave him and he gets married to mara jade skywalker
dude kissed a woman he didn t know was his sister and originally got married to a red headed woman who was a beloved character even though she was never in the original trilogy.he s not gay.
if it isn t written or endorsed by george lucas  it isn t canon.wookiepedia just damaged their credibility.
mark hamill is in danger of making me happy that rian johnson kissed him off so badly.
next it will be padme was actually lesbian  involved with someone from her court of ladies  and used anakin merely for stud service  and that s why he s darth vader.
to try to reconcile disney star wars to real star wars  luke is going to leave mara jade to get together with kylo ren.i don t think it will work.
lara croft is married to history.
in the extended universe for star wars  luke meets a sexy sith assassin who he brings back to the light and marries  her name was mara jade.he is not a homosexual.
mark making the same mistake j.k. rowling did. it all started with  dumbledore is gay now.
let s be honest hamill only saying this to keep his job truth be told alot of actors will literally be forced to support the agenda.
if mark hammel s straight  then he can never do anything with luke given the crowd he s pandering to xd.
luke is not gay ! and you f cking know it hamill !
why it might not be canon anymore but you cant retcon luke skywalker and mara jade who eventually get married and have a son ben skywalker. look at the new movies they tried to change it and people really didn t like it. he s definitely not gay based of his actual character.
not until i hear george lucas say it
it would be nice if they could just leave these legacy characters alone. they can make anything they want but no  they just want to hijack something popular and mould it to fit into the boxes they want to see represented. literally not even a vague hint that luke was a man lover in the movies.
the irony of this is that the people who are pushing this movement want to be seen and accepted as normal  while doing the most outlandish things.
he was looking happy when leila kiss him
a jedi isn t supposed to know love
man i wonder why korea and japan are kicking hollywood s ass
luke  meanwhile  married a woman named mara jade  an assassin who previously served emperor palpatine. the couple had one son  a jedi named ben skywalker  whose descendants would go own to have jedi adventures in their own times.
could someone please interview george   and ask what he thinks of disney s treatment of legacy characters
his next film will be  broke back wookie
it s kind of amusing watching hollywood continue to self-destruct all its biggest money making franchises then give surprised pikachu face when people stop spending money on their garbage.
mark hamill stars as luke donggrabber in woke wars
mara jade forever
well... if you really want to be more accurate to the movies   luke never really made a move on any girls after princess leia. maybe he s asexual.
he has had multiple gf s in legends   in  canon  his one and only was mara jade.
if he  or lucas  had said this in 1979 i d say okay  no problem.  but they didn t.  and they didn t say it 15  or 10  or even 5  years ago.  so this is moral  and intellectual  cowardice.
we officially live in a clown world dumpster fire
cutscenes in games are not decreased quality or lesser of a game. heck  even walking simulators as well as visual novels are  games .
it matters not what he is he can t have relationships period. hes a jedi.
i guess  next he is gonna say joker is g@y to
a few years ago  the marvel x-men comics declared that ice man  booby drake  is gay. this is in contradiction with the whole history of the character. he was always chasing girls in the early days of the x-men  and he has had intimate relationships with several major female characters  including mystique and polaris.  i hate this woke retcon nonsense.
luke literally kissed his own sister he ain t gay they on that nonsense.
jedi aren t supposed to have emotional attachments  so i think all jedi are technically a-sexual  idk.
well considering he really had the hots for leia until he found out she was his sister. and also with canon books   luke skywalker had a wife   mara jade who was initially contracted to kill him by orders from palpatine and she was one of his best assassin s. luke and mara fell in love and had  a jedi wedding after she converted to become a jedi   and they had two children . the woke community is so crazy.
for real!
and yet annakin was married...
@conscious gentile  safe to say he learned his lesson. it clouded his judgement.
@conscious gentile  against the jedi order
he wasn t gay... ignore the woke actors...
ever heard of this thing called  death of the author   well  in this case it d be death of the actor.. but still
mark hamill s always had strong opinions and a sardonic wit  from what i have seen  which was funny in better times when society was more secure in itself. now its just manifest into malice  to be frank.
ugh.. this is the end times  i swear. next darth vader identified as a wookie.
luke was married to mara jade  and another woman elsewhere.  he had several hetero relationships in the expanded universe.
nothing in any of the 3 original films even hinted luke as being gay his mannerisms and everything told you otherwise.  hence the 1st star wars the moment luke sees the image of leia from r2  who is she    she s beautiful .  or in empire when leia kisses luke and he leans back kind of stunned and satisfied.  i have a brother who is gay and he even hates this narrative.  star wars was his favorite film trilogy growing up in the 70 s and 80s.   before disney destroyed all the future novels rebooting everything he marries mara jade and has a son named ben.  at no point was he gay.  this is just more bait and switch bullshit like melonie said it they should just create a new character in one of the tv series.  i kept thinking of the diamonds are forever movie with mr. wint and mr. kidd there is no doubt those characters were gay but it was done correctly rather than these baseless claims.
ok  ok.  think about it  he makes out with his sister  unbeknownst to him  so anytime he is kissing another women will remind him of his sister
you went from reporting on gamer comic news to being our conservative common sense network. lol.
luke married mara jade. their son  ben  who was named after luke s first mentor obi-wan  ben  kenobi  was born in 26.5 aby.
didn t he literally love leia before knowing it was her sister  yeah sure  he is gay  if hamill at least told us he was bisexual  we could buy that  not really because it s not said on the story  but you get the point .
mark hamill has no say in the sexuality of luke skywalker. george lukas is the only person who gets to determine that  as he is the characters creator. luke had a interesting reaction to a girl kissing him when in the med ship   later finds out his sister   and later luke is married to mara jade and has a kid. does not sound all that homosexual to me.
luke use the shourts
this is not surprising - maybe he wasn t in iv or v  but something changed him and it was pretty obvious in the last three movies of general suck.
wokeypedia! must have thought leia was wearing a furry costume in the hologram xd
disney has just decided to put stars wars in the grave. rip stars wars. luke is not gay  he was very attracted to lela. he didn t know she was sister. although they should have sensed each other being apart of one of the strongest force users in that universe. you would have thought they would have sensed who each other were. but whatever .at least we still the originals.
why is he siding with that side  when they are mad at him for liking a jk rowling tweet  keep it up guy  drive your real fans away.
why do they want to ruin everything from our childhood s
don t worry  i view all disney related sw materials as non-cannon. lmao
before disney took over  luke was married to mara jade
luke skywalker is a fictional character and one lucas has never really defined. that said ls could be gay  straight  bi or whatever
clowner-reear  lmao i like it! hey the woke make up their own words  why not make up our own too
one question......is he projecting
jedi are not supposed to have physical attachments. they are supposed to avoid anything that could lead them to the dark side.
like skywalker had a wife and a son. he s not gay in the slightest.
no true fan will buy any of this b.s.  mark.  see  we true fans remember how he felt about leia.  we remember him really really liking it when leia kissed him -- of course  this was before they found out they were siblings!  oh  we also remember mara jade and she and luke got married --darth kathleen    that never happened. the true fans    wait  what    there were so many eu books -- ! darth kathleen    there was no source material!  those books never happened  so luke is gay!  right  mark ! mark    r-right!  don t be istaphobes  everybody! the true fans    shut up  mark!
now i see why god said cast out all imaginations that r not like him matter tf since spongebob said  imagination  i already knew oh shit
much like dumbledore and velma  retroactively made gay when there s no evidence  dumbledore  or even evidence to the contrary  velma . he literally marries mara jade  but i guess that doesn t count because it s now considered a  legend   so stupid.
knife to marks back  yeah sure luke is gay hahaha .
this is only possible because kk unalived mara jade.
i wasn t sure that is what hamill was saying at all  but looking at the older interview.... he allows for the possibility depending on the perspective of the viewer.  personally  i completely disagree  seeing the ersatz book and the decidedly fan-based wookiepedia.  but i don t see hamill saying it explicitly means skywalker is gay.  it is purely the machination of an activist and nothing more.  what this does imply is there is more questioning of the decision to jettison the entire expanded universe  wherein luke had the romance with mara jade.
happy valentine s day  melonie. but   gobears
not gonna lie  when i was a kid my mom said luke probably wears leis dresses when she s not looking. i was outraged  but then i couldn t unsee it. mark hamill is pretty effeminate.
yeah i m pretty much done with star wars for a variety of reasons at this point!!!
all these  terms  seem to change daily. for years the original luke skywalker was my hero. the thing he has become isn t a shadow of what he was.
this is like when rowling retconned that dumbledore was gay  like we didn t need to know that  and this stuff is only done so that people can claim characters that were never theirs to begin with.luke isn t gay  and he isn t bisexual either. maybe jake skywalker is  but not luke. disney can keep their revisionist history  because i m not accepting it.
that s not what i heard when he kissed leia
sorry  but i ve been done with hamill for quite some time now. twitter really revealed him as the nut job he is. i could go on just fine if sw was properly recovered and they never gave him a call back for any role.
maybe the people who obsess about the sexuality of fictional characters  do so because they are obsessed with sex.
in the canonical universe  luke never marries.  in the legends universe  luke marries fellow force-wielder mara jade and has one son  ben skywalker.
no he isn t he s just insane he has stopped being luke a long time ago now he s just a deranged sad actor waiting for the days when they used to mean something.
there s books after the movies he s not gay he falls in love with mara jade
towing the line. playing ball  whatever clich  of the like that fits.  in the end  i think it s the actors knowing what the current climate is like in hollywood and and saying what they need to get another paycheck.  we all know it s about  . small percentage of them  at best  give any kind of damn about the people or causes being pimped by the ones telling them that they should.  have huge love for those who don t tow that line.  henry cavill  idris elba being the bigger of the names recently.  but there are others  we just don t hear about them as much because certain outlets won t let them  hurt the brand  by covering them.
i give you three words  mara jade skywalker
poor mark just to stay relevant
aren t jedi supposed to be like space monks  and not have any sexual relationships  or desires
wait luke is gay  is he changing light sabers for meat sabers
luke had a wife  mara jade  and a son  ben  in the books. i grew up reading those books and watching the the original trilogy. it sucks that they can twist the lore to this trash.
hey  melonie happy valentines day  . anyway it does not look like mark hamill looks gay at all and he doesn t look gay in the star wars movie series. anyway luke skywalker was married and had a baby boy. also who cares if mark hamill was playing a character of a gay man in the star wars movie series. anyway i don t have any problems with mark hamill playing a character role of a gay man in star wars movie series at all. anyway i just want to make a comment about this topic of the video for today and i just want to tell you happy valentines day to you and also i just want to tell you that welcome back home melonie. anyway hope you had a great trip and visit with your family over the weekend and i hope you had a great trip back home melonie. anyway i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. anyway have a great day melonie.
thanks for the late breaking news from a 2016 interview!  ...fans are writing and ask all these questions   i m bullied in school... i m afraid to come out . they say to me   could luke be gay   i d say it is meant to be interpreted by the viewer... if you think luke is gay  of course he is. you should not be ashamed of it. judge luke by his character  not by who he loves.  - the totally  unreasonable  quote from said 2016 interview
ok i m going to age myself on this one. i ve had gay friends since the 80s. this is nothing new. the amount of conversations i ve had about whether or not bugs bunny was gay or not or any other popular character you wouldn t believe. i don t know why they do it but trying to shoehorn classic characters into gaydom seems to be a national sport. good luck.
before disney luke had a wife named mara jade skywalker.
i m a 40k nerd... i think that warhammer will be that last place to go to avoid this stuff. it s actually already built into the universe... the 40k universe is so big that no one would try and turn leman russ trans. we already have slanesh for that! long story short  check out 40k. i gave up on starwars years ago...
luke always seemed asexual to me
for the first time in my life  i can proudly say that i m not a part of the star wars community. i was a fan of lucas era star wars from 1995 until disney killed the property  but i feel no desire to have anything to do with disney star wars and their sycophants.
the old eu books weren t perfect  but they re way  way better than what disney has done  and they were approved by george lucas. captain kirk has it right. luke married mara jade.
but  in that galaxy  gay  means exclusively attracted to women  or at least one s sister.
luke isn t gay because no gay guy would have gone through what luke went through to become a jedi.  they would have just complained on whatever social media is in the starwars universe.
george lucas said there s no such thing as gay in star wars
wasnt this a tweet from mark hamill from 2016  from the string of heterosexual relationships marrying mara jade... not gay. it simply is that. its okay to not be gay. its okay to be gay and i think thats the politically correct answer to a loaded question from a fan to avoid being attacked by the load of wankers that just wait to get crazy  hysterical and violent  in the wings to be offended by whatever is opposite to their emotionally immature mind.
i ll never understand why anyone defends mark for the jk rowling when it isn t worth it with the crap he says does. stop defending hollywood when hollywood wouldn t care to defend you.
i can just see disney saying  don t worry. this will save star wars  .  of course it comes from my favorite writer shrew of all time sam mags.  don t know her   look her up.
in the later stages of luke skywalkers life he is so focused on the force that all human needs matters not.
funfics can t change canon even if they are published by big companies.
the only  only person that can come out and 100  say that luke was gay is george lucas.  if they ever do add  preferred pronouns  into waakapedia  cara dune better have hers as beep boop!
i ve personally decided luke skywalker is not gay  because i m sure my opinion is as valid as anyone else s. and what does george lucas have to say about this
i said he s nit in a tick tock about this and got smacked with shit tone of comments saying he is bi sexual the comics dont matter
the entire star wars story was a all in lukes head. when luke got hit in the head by the sand people  he was in a coma. he was dreaming the entirety of the star wars saga  including the prequels and tv shows. thats why they are all off the walls bonkers.see  anyone can say random crap. doesnt mean its true.
didn t luke kiss his sister granted he didn t know at the time but was rubbing it in han solo s face
if luke is gay  then disney wouldn t have treated him so poorly in the cr@ppy sequel series. not buying it. however  now i m sure they ll retcon it and we ll get that luke skywalker series we always wanted lol.
part of me thinks he doesn t genuinely believe this but he s just too coked up in towing the partisan line.
what irritates the crap out of me is this. not every aspect of love or chemistry or deep feelings is freaking sexual!. dose nobody have real true friends  i absolutely love my close  male friends hell were closer than some couples i ve seen  but nothing sexual there. it s crazy how media seems to think oh he she looked at him her must be sexual. damned stupid and doesn t reflect reality. not every deep emotion is rooted in sex good freaking grief!
i genuinely don t care at this point  as star wars is something i used to care about  but now am completely and irrevocably apathetic about.  i have no plans or intention of watching any star wars content in the future unless there s some drastic  fundamental change for the better  which is extremely unlikely.
your talk reminds me of the old joke... i have three kids  one of each.
god bless based white girls because they are an insanely rare breed now. hold this like  queen.
this is why i  believe in the eu  because that is the true storyline of star wars and the story of luke skywalker!disney star wars is non-canon to me!
luke isn t gay. change my mind.
the only few genres i could think of where sexuality matters are romantic movies and porn. star wars is neither of those  so why does sexuality matter  that character had one  eat this  han!  kiss in three movies  that s it.
insert  you were the chosen one!
tbf  since it s not explicit  people are free to make luke whatever they want in their head-canon. honestly  who cares  in my head-canon  the only one that matters to me   luke is hetero.
mark hamill says a lot of things.  and almost all of them are wrong.  he was great as the joker though.
happy valentine s day melonie
luke arsewalker son of drag vader. what could go wrong   with meat sabers anyway
i hate this type of foolishness. they even had a psychic teenager jean gray make iceman gay. it felt more like he played a horrible joke on her and she effed with him as payback. but why would someone who s psychic make someone gay and not do the opposite  it s a mental illness so why not fix it not mess with his mind in a way to make him want to shove something into  a  er
why is sexuality even a topic of conversation in school   let children be children and let them deal once they are old enough to even understand what sexuality even is . this whole new world where we have to change everything for these wokeies is just disgusting. i m so sick of it all
great video  mel.
retroactively doing or saying something is low intelligence pandering and character progression.fans know what the life of a jedi require even when one breaks one to get with someone.same goes for ellie of  the last of us . there s no indication she is gay from the game and the dlc was used to push it.there s no indication luke is and as a  paid puppet  none of them have any validity in all this given how easy they give in.
he s getting senile he was referring to jar jar binks
the clowneration of the nation  shows the mental castration of this generation. the sensation-elation- from their vocal perturbation  hurts the soul  blocking the mind from true creation
there is no evidence in canon to support this  and in legends he was married to mara jade... only the full novels are considered canon  secondary to what s shown on screen   the young adult comics and youth short stories are not  so no  he isn t.
not everyone is obsessed with the sexuality  just a certain group...
puts hands behind his head  very pleased with himself that leia kisses him and dislikes han.....so gay.i love mark  but  come on  man
alec guinness did not play obi wan as a bi sexual.
the magnitude of projection is pretty remarkable. these people want to subsume every conceivable ip under that flag because it s the only thing they understand  and preposterous to them to suggest otherwise. i remember the early 2000s when the derisive running gag was that frodo and sam must be gay. i m almost surprised people these days aren t loudly promoting and proclaiming that to be canon. never mind tolkien s lived experiences in the trenches and real world experiences of brotherhood  camaraderie  loss and death in a living hell. ... but if people want to eagerly retcon sexual intimacy between two hairy midgets i guess that s their prerogative. then again  there s plenty of other stories and ip s out there to screw up and otherwise draw their insectlike attention span.
yeah  no.   he could make a decent argument for luke being bi  but luke was clearly into leia before he found out she was his sister.  and besides the jedi are basically a celibate order anyways unless you break the rules.  they shouldn t have sexual attractions to anyone after fully becoming a jedi.
did kissing his own sister emotionally scar luke so bad he became gay
i d probably watch star wars  if it wasn t for the terrible fandom and mark hamill ruining any interest i may have had.
mark hamill lost his marbles.
anything made after episode 3  timeline wise episode 6  is not canon.if gorge lucas didn t contribute to it it aint canon so luke is 100  not gay.
as one who s known luke s choice in who he marrys after buying the comic where does it and i m sure many who has read it he is definitely not gay unless for some stupid reason disney bring mara jade into canon and makes her a trans women and tell the public hes still gay but that wouldn t appeal to the radicals they don t like the truth about trans being men with a mental illness
mara jade  mother of luke s child says otherwise.
so basically the gay character later tries to kill his nephew  fails to rebuild the jedi order and runs away to another planet to become a reclusive loser who drinks green milk from aliens. quite the representation there.
the weird ships in all media feel highly perverted to me. if it s a part of the story  ok whatever i guess. adding later makes no sense.
mark is just trying to win back the wokies. tragic.
idk why wokesters try to turn every character without a love interest gay. luke and jedis in general are forbidden to love as part of the jedi code. anakin actually broke the rules. think of jedis like monks. they avoid pleasures of the flesh  so they can serve a higher purpose and grow wiser with age without worldly distractions getting in the way.
i knew it all along.
i always thought that luke was a wuss. i related to han solo a lot more. he and i have very similar personalities. and  leia was sort of toxic femininity in the original movie. she was just abusive to any and all male characters for no real reason. she was a spoiled brat. that  and there s just no way that an untrained jedi in the final battle against the emperor could have defeated him just by crossing two lightsabers. no way. yoda couldn t beat him but an untrained jedi could  get out of here.
dude s so not-gay he tried to nail his sister.
technically if you are a jedi  you aren t allowed to haven t romantic relationships. that is what led to the downfall of anakin  the creation of vader and to a genocide. as far as luke goes  he was sure proud of himself when he kissed leia. that isn t what a gay man would do. if anything luke was a straight man  but once he became a jedi master  he became asexual for obvious reasons.
so they made lunk into an abject failure who retired to hermit rock in order wallow impotently in self-pity  regret and blue milk... then they reveal he s gay  good call  mickey. next  warner bros tries to outdo them by revealing voldemort was not only trans  but _so trans that he carved his soul up into seven pieces in deep denial.
he was so gay that he felt in love with his sister.
these people are so oppressed....did you know  that is the sign of oppression is when the oppressed take everything from the so called  oppressors  whilst those just idly watch the whole thing playing out today is your childhood hero  tomorrow historical figures. everything is going to be theirs.thank heaven i got out of star wars after disney took over. in fact rogue one wasn t canon to begin with.
i m bisexual  i do not feel represented when they do this. i feel offended.they re pandering.they got rid of lukes wife and kid so why would i care what he fap to on his island
luke married a redhead former imperial assassin named mara jade  and had a son named ben skywalker. period.mark lost any credibility in this regard when he wanted to abort his unborn grandchild.
first of all  luke is not the most iconic sw character. 2nd  mark probably got a few     thrown his way just to say that bs. smh
mara jade skywalker waaaaaay back when i was a kid. was his wife!!! how did this change   !!!
i don t care what mark hamill thinks  and i don t care what disney says. the person whose opinion matters to me is george lucas. until he comes out  so to speak  and gives a take on it then i ve only got the evidence of what s on film  not what losers on a star wars wiki or coporate interests held hostage by politics say. there s no evidence luke is gay in the original films.
oh dang  william shatner! oh captain my captain!
mark hamill is a disappointment as a movie star  because he doesn t know the role  as he projects his perversion and caves to the woke-ism.  luke skywalker is a hero role  this isn t about being a loser  it is about the boy who lives under the stairs with special powers  who is mentored into the force  who is a wizard  and no joke about the comparison to the harry potter theme .  mark hamill is proof that actors don t need to understand anything  they put on a show for the director and camera  the director and editor together make the real story  mark hamill is a puppet  and we just need to look for the director s hand up his backside.  disney is getting ready to lose star wars to the woke-ism  because their revision is demented  and from the dreams of prostitution.
most people aren t queer by a huge margin. why do most fictional characters have to be  the math doesn t add up and people with normal sexuality don t obsess about it.
the left  no one s grooming anyone!a few moments later   a book targeted for the age range of 9-12
the author that wrote the story where luke seems other is just a bad writer incapable of writing from a masculine perspective.
star wars legends  mara jade  enters the chat   i m going to destroy disney s  star wars whole career.
luke is not gay. now mark hamill himself is ruining the character  why mark  you used to be beautiful!
i m not about drama. in fact  i don t even care what other people choose to believe or do with their own lives. but  to erase history  or in film  etc.  and replace it with lies is just wrong. i m too poor for disneyland  but i m boycotting everything disney moving forward just because i m sick of it being indoctrinated on children. if it s 18 year old teens then it s whatever  but children shouldn t be fed propaganda or adult things. a child cannot make their own decisions and yes that includes their religious ideologies. children should play with toys and live freely as long as they possibly can until they grow up and become a capitalist slave like the rest of us. then they can choose what path they want to follow.
this is where we find out that luke is still gay because mara used to be a man named moron.
i can understand george lucas to some extent  because you sold his ip of star wars off to disney! i don t know if anybody has noticed  but disney is strong and regurgitating old ip  trying to mould it to whatever trend is going on! i think it s amazing that anybody that is an actor or actress  playing a character  can say it make statements such as this! but meanwhile  the people or person in this case that came up with the story  adding characters as they build up the story  yet they re not bowing down  to this epidemic that we currently live in  where people cannot give the definition of a woman  there s what 86 different sex orientation is now! people identify as the opposite sex because it s convenient! there s people out there that are starting to identify as in animate objects  etc at the rate we are going   harry potter is about to be gay  i m surprised disney has it made yoda  a non-binary  person  a small stature  that is attracted to sandworms! voldemort was angry because he couldn t come out of the closet  i mean come on! everybody wants to know why people are cancelling the subscription services  netflix makes something   a series that it s half decent.  i want to cancel it.disney is basically the equivalent of the third reichs propaganda machine  for the woke ideology epidemic  that is not only destroying a country  but culture  and businesses!
bro ..  maybe mark is just trolling at this point  that dude openly and very sarcastically blasted the new movies and the directions they took esp with luke etc
so  i m about done with star wars. it s forever ruined at this point. the new trilogy  the shows  making existing characters gay  it is just over for me.this is really sad for me as i have been watching star wars since j was a little boy in 1981. the empire strikes back was the first film i ever saw in theatres.i don t care about gay or straight. but changing luke skywalker into a gay man is just too much. i m tired or of woke mob hijacking s the things i have loved for my whole life. activists are nothing but trolls who insist on destroying everything we love.they re killing my childhood. i didn t have a happy childhood. i had a lot of turmoil and suffered a lot of abuse. there are very few moments i can look back in fondness at my youth. star wars was one of them. that s swiftly being blown away by the woke mob who doesn t care. they don t care about me  you  anyone else. they don t care about these properties. they only care of hurting others in the name of acceptance.
remember when mark hamill had some shred of a backbone when he denounced the nonsensical changes to luke in last jedi  good times. he continues to be a disappointment.
let s not forget mara jade  his wife .
as a diehard sw fan  both the praise for  making luke gay  and the outrage over  making luke gay  coming from the normies is quite comical. all it takes is a little bit of research to see that 1. no  they did not canonically make luke skywalker gay. anyone that says they did within this story is simply self-inserting what they want to see rather than what is actually on the page. 2. mark hamill did not say that luke skywalker is gay. mark hamill said that if a homosexual child wants to interpret luke as gay if they want to  they re welcome to  effectively making luke a template character. the  of course  comment is being viewed out of context  it being in reference to if people can interpret luke as gay. he s being diplomatic  although  in fairness  i don t really see how anyone could interpret him as gay as they d have to mentially edit out the fact he overtly is interested in his then unrevealed sister. that is utterly not the same thing as saying he is gay.
makes sense wasn t he in a relationship with herbert in family guy xd
mara jade  his wife.  and ben skywalker  his son in the eu  not kylo ren.  would disagree with you mark. disney verse is not canon  and never will be.
luke is lgbtq   so he s a lesbian and a gay guy  who s bisexual  transgendered  queer and a jedi  wow. what an overachiever.
hay hamill i have 3 words for you mara jade skywalker.
instead of turning luke to the gay side of the force  mark hamill ought to use his influence with the folks at dc to address their utterly poor representation of bisexuals. why insist on making harley quinn and poison ivy a couple  they aren t lesbians. they re both bisexual. the vast majority of bisexuals ending up in committed relationships end up in relationships with a member of the opposite sex. bruce wayne  batman and  dr. harleen quinzel  harley quinn would make at least as good a couple as dr. pamela ivy  poison ivy and dr. harleen quinzel. bruce has the intj personality type. harleen has the enfp personality type. in terms of a long term romantic relationship  bruce and harleen would make for an ideal personality type match. their personality types would be near perfect complements.the joker has the same personality type harley quinn has  enfp. so they have perhaps too much in common  they don t complement one another at all. this didn t stop harley from trying to make things work with the joker. she tried everything to win his adoration. harley went out of her way to be an amazing mate for the joker. and yet  the joker never appreciated harley. he treats harley horribly so. it would surely be poetic justice if the woman he took for granted ends up being the love interest and most important person in the life of bruce wayne.i ve met one of the writers for dc comics a number of times  scott snyder. he s a truly amazing guy  a wonderful gentleman. i can t sing his praises highly enough. next time i run into scott  i m going to raise the issue of harley. i would like to reimagine the emancipation of harley quinn. why did harley put up with the joker s abuse for so long  well  both harley and the joker have the same personality type  enfp. perhaps  for a time  the joker represented an ideal version of harley  the person harley wanted to be. he gave in completely to the dark side of their personality type. and perhaps  for a time  harley wanted to do the same  but she couldn t. harley couldn t truly be like the joker  a person she viewed as her ideal self. and so  she sought the next best thing  to be the sort of person her ideal self would adore and want to be with. and so harley set out to be adored by the joker. and yet  her imagined ideal self didn t adore her. and maybe  harley realized that she didn t need the joker to adore her. she needed to validate her own self  all along.perhaps harley realized that she was a better version of her own self all along. whereas the joker gave in entirely to the dark side of his enfp personality type  forsaking the more constructive and positive aspects of his own self  harley harnessed the constructive and positive aspects of their personality type. in doing so  she achieved all kinds of great things. harley became a brilliant psychiatrist. harley came very close to becoming an olympic athlete. the joker could have achieved all kinds of things  but he chose to give up on the better parts of his own self. he chose to be a lesser version of the enfp he could be. and harley did the same  for a time  but not any more.
i think mark is trying to tell us something.
i m kind of apathetic about this. i just think   does this really matter enough to make a video about   he doesn t control star wars  so he could say luke is a palpatine and rey is a skywalker  and i d just be like   okay. not true  but okay.  aren t there better things to make a video about  i keep thinking this video is just going to be used as ammo that anyone against woke doesn t know how to pick their battles  exactly like the woke. it s your channel  so make what you want  of course! i m just throwing in my two cents as a fan.
they conviiently forgot about mara jade
so now i will be gay if i am going headlock and hug pat my mates
according to the movies hes sure as hell isn t
he is married for 44 years to the same woman.
and chewbacca was a single mother. i mean  birthing wookie  ....
tired sigh and facepalm  mara jade  ben skywalker
you mean it as a slur mark   because that i understand after what they did to the character.   but i will never believe he is actually  gay .
mara jade is true canon
he s not gay l article
i wonder if mara jade has an opinion on this.
after tongue kissing his own sister maybe
we need more gatekeeping to keep the weirdos out of our hobbies  they re just there to ruin them.
so intelligent  so attractive!
someone tries doing this with link from zelda and i went after them and told them to stop  being stupid.
only george lucas  knows  not the actor  and not disney.
i ve not  to this day  heard a good argument in favor of representation.
skywalker  more like...rainbowrider
in the star wars expanded universe luke skywalker was married to mara jade and they had a son named ben skywalker
he has a wife and kids he s married to mara jade
@0 53 sadness as big kitty leaves the scene  lol
getting weird  it s been weird for at least 10 years
5 49 it s adobe-wan rencon-obi  the dark trans brother of obi-wan  who did it
he used to be.  then he saw your hair.
someone should tell mara jade
happy valentine s day.
one second he s kissing his sister  the next he s gay it s called marvel sexual  get with the times lmao
after he kissed his sister  he turned gay. lol
sounds likes he begging for his job back.
first happy valentine to pretty melonie second i dont know about luke maybe he is even so i like more han solo so is a fictional character we need to ask lucasfilms to be sure but anyway if luke is gay life continues..
they are crazy - luke skywalker is not gay hahahaha !
what !!! when did this happen ! !  i thought he was still in love with his sister   question  is that why there swords are in colors   each color goes with a lgbtq  name
rename him  kook gaystalker .
i don t want to live on this planet anymore
occupy wallstreet  happens.billionaires  we gotta make everyone fight eachother and not us  make everything super divisive fast!
yeah  nevermind his wife in the expanded universe...
it make me wonder what it was that made these people fans of these ip s in the first place  now those ips are no longer the thing that for so many loved
wasn t it not long ago brie larson was begging for a mara jade part. does that character not exist anymore
12 31 children talking about sexuality is grooming. there s no question about it.
actually no. mark hamill says that if the person thinks he is gay  why can he be  not the same as saying  luke is gay
didn t luke have a son in legends
makes sense.skywalker desperately wanted to put his torpedo in the emperor s death star.it s all so obvious now... gawd these clowns need a life outside of media.
vader did notting wrong now.
dark days we currently live...
remember  it might be silent  but there s an i in the lgbt  community somewhere.
stop tolerancestart vigilance
sounds like it s crusade o clock
he said  fans   not  children .  this insinuation that mark hamill is a groomer is a little bit of a reach  lol...
mark is just an actor  not the creator. the guy is just begging for attention  move along.
happy valentines day ima.
but of course he is
luke skywalker says mark hamill is gay!
i seem to have missed the pole by which the mayority of the star wars community decided that bullshit.
only in episode 8
mel lookin g like a snack in this video!
some activist  so luke being gay is just nerd s fanfic
hes gay because he kissed his sister ok... he realized after he found out who she was that he was really just a moe.
luke isn t gay in the comics which are canon and in lore he had a wife after defeating the empire mara jade
bruh  i like mark but let s leave the decisions to the creator himself.
are they removing the books from canon
tell that to mara jade!
mark hamill is probably gay  but luke isn t.
and there is nothing wrong with that. kinda kills the expanded universe but sure. i m okay with that
ezra skywalker i suppose.
well  mark hamill didn t create luke so...
well  i ignore all of disney star wars and the cannon i follow say he was married to mara jade and definately did the deed and they had a son named ben.  and  eventually  there were grandchlidren and great grandchildren.   so eff the change.
let s ask george lucas
maybe his sister turned him after they did the deeds.  lol  but he liked the kisses on film.  but yeah  not gay.
member when he made out with his sister pepperidge farm remembers.
why are we asking the actor of the character and the creator of the character
melonie! i love your tattoos and you have crazy pretty hair. marry me. lol jk happy valentine s day!
i feel like mark hammil was slowly turned into this. i mean the whole thing with luke made him pissed...but yeah home boy needs to stop. the horse is dead.
luke has kids in cannon  so answer is no
didnt he say this in 2016 .. old news mel
the erasure of women has come for mara jade...
of course luke is straight
mara jade be like  ...
he simped over his sister and kissed her
of course. remember that time he was totally gay for his sister  that big ol  smile and smug look he gave when she kissed him to piss off han  totally gay. how could we not see it
okay  mark hamill  i want to see you come back and french kiss a dude.  then i ll believe it.
dude probably trying to jump out of closet using luke  let him be........
luke isn t gay lol smirked when he kissed his own sister. not to mention all the lord before disney bought it. pretty sure he had kids.
how do you know the shame of kissing his sister didnt turn him off of all women
does that make it the wokie-pedia now
woke will be the end of humanity.  are these people on a woke payroll or something  who is behind all of this
he kinda is tho
love that moke wob
it s idiotic  luke wanted to save leia bcuz he thought she was hot
yeah! nomanche !
luke skywalker is not like that  he did kiss his sister and loved it.come on man..
the shareholders wont be satisfied n content with this thats for sure lol
they are only saying this because being gay is apparently...the in thing right now.  give it a few years and being diabetic will be the in thing.
didn t luke get married and have a kid
luke kissed his sister how the f is that gay
dear mark hamill  i m getting bullied  was luke a right wing christian  asking for a friend
alright you want me to acknowledge that luke is gay  show me one thing from the original films that implies that luke was gay  surely after 6 hours of film you can point out something obvious
how much did they pay him
wait...obi wan is gay  i feel sorry for duchess satine
didnt luke have a son
well isn t mark hamil gay   in real life makes sense
someone needs to explain to me wtf a he they is
tf of course  before he knew leia was his sister  he had no qualms at all with hookin  up with shawty. so that is some buuuuuuuuullllllllsh
this is all i have to say to hamill s statement. https   youtu.be fpd5q6dc43m
mara jade skywalker....... just sayin .
but luke had a crush on his sister lea and hooked up with her.
your kitty cat  and it s tail.
luke had a wife
one min hes kissing his sister the next hes gay! sounds like kentucky to me.
so i guess almost having incest with his sister just didnt happen  sorry not happening.
someone gonna break the news the mara jade skywalker. luke s wife and mother of his child
i m sure that s news to mara jade
did you know that t-800 is bisexual
i dont care  cant even muster anger anymore.
did you not see his makeup job for the christmas special ! he s so obviously gay!
he can say whatever he likes. he s still wrong.
the wokepedia says luke skywalker is gay
remember  sexuality isn t a choice. unless it is forced upon loved characters to appease the woke mob.
mara jade rolling in her legends grave
naw like was married in the books lol
i thought luke was gay back in the 70 s and 80 s!  lol
this franchise died a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
don t understand if this is supposed to be a joke video or not towards mark but all of these specific things he says as jokes. he s a pretty sarcastic person. and is pretty well known for mocking this stuff. so maybe get your facts straight first before making up pointless videos like this.
he was pretty into the kiss he got from his sister before he knew she was his sister  p and didnt he marry mara jade
i don t remember the i in lbgt  dude was really into his sister.
bungie does it in destiny regularly.  mentally ill people just can t help themselves.
thanks!
it s all bullshit and by the way i straight forever my friend @meloniemac
more women for me
mark hamill is but not luke skywalker
he isn t gay
luke  is gay  i thought he was into droids.
the film was released in 1977  if he was gay we would all know it.
shame they have to hijack things nd ruin them
if luke is gay then why did he marry mara jade
red foreman was correct then
mara jade says otherwise.
you know its bad when captain kirk of star trek is calling star wars out on this pandering campaign.
sick
chewbacca is shewbacca
authoritative  star wars fan encyclopaedia...more like authoritarian.
another look at me .... i m not dead ... shit take from mark  nobody would know who the fuck i am if not for star wars  hamill.
luke is more from alabama than gay.. but also most guys from alabama are gay..i guess ... i hope..in the words of the honorable reverend pasta   why are u gay
activist writer  should have been a clue. always check your sources.
he was marry to some girl name mary skywalker. that be very very sad if they make him gay.  happy valentine s day.
colonizing and invading can be ideological   if the gatekeepers give up.
really  he was gay... but he had the hots for leah before he knew it was is sister
good grief
okay marky mark im usually with you  but this be a bridge to far friend.
darn those blt characters.
han solo is a furry
...peak clown world if you just fan fic a character then just assume it is now canon...when i watched the trilogy i never thought more of luke then he had space wizard powers...didn t really care about whos bunk he slipped into whoops am i canceled now for dead naming
i wouldn t be at all surprised if they start making darth vader gay and darth sidious gay ha ha ha
and mara jade    i won t forgive disney for retconning the eu.
mark hamil is gay. that s what he was really saying
honestly i feel like this world needs to burn. very disappointed in mr. hamil  he bend the knee.
mark hamill likely has dementia in his old age.  i ll just assume as much.   it was a fun ride  mark  but...... ya.mel  cute as always.
the real luke is the luke from the original movies and the original comics when he has a wife and children so this is bogus.
mara jade
its a red flag wen kids are involved
i wouldn t be surprised if  for example  in the next toy story film all the characters were lgbt  and the makers couldn t explain the flop. because according to  published opinion  everyone wants to be transgender.
disney...
fake   grey
at this point i don t care anymore.
also if luke is gay  then he cant have any kids with mara jade. that means no more skywalkers unless you submit and accept rey. lol
luke...gets off to a girl kissing him in empire. definitely gay
i ve never liked mark hamill. this doesn t improve things! he was good in a few scenes in empire strikes back. i ll seal those precious memories of him at his very best.
luke was never gay i don t care what anyone says luke and leia were into each other until they found out they were brother and sister then they were like wait what gross.
i am so sick of this.
i don t care about disney star wars  under george lucas  luke is not gay
luke skywalker   mark hamill
mark hamill   the joker is a transgendered non binary lesbian   obvious when you see the makeup really  not a real quote. yet.
luke skywalker is not gay.  c.f. star wars  a new hope and then the extended universe with mara jade.
from what i understand he s married with kids in the extended universe  i know they killed it  but there is no indication he would even be lgbt this would offend me if i was gay. i wish they would focus on making a good character who just so happens to be gay is that so hard
it s not about lara liking ladies it s about men liking lara. anything straight men enjoy must be destroyed. that s the agenda  plain and simple.
lol i don t think he is  but isn t it irrelevant either way  jedi aren t supposed to have relationships...
mark may be gay but luke isn t.
goodbye mara.
mark hamil is a great guy but luke is not gay
where is george lucas in all this  did he confirm that  he invented star wars so he should have a say right
why  why   everything is so woke that there is nothing to watch anymore
no he s not. damn these people  think everyone  in films and tv as to represent  some how.
back off women  luke is ours.
what is your cat s name
wait  what  luke skywalker is not a gay. his been married on mara jade in the legend  he had a son from her. he just can t be gay  that s impossible
no. no  he is not. end of discussion.
mara jade i guess is getting erased strong female characters don t matter apparently
doesn t like get married in the original star wars universe
everyone is gay! yay
it s funny how the right is upset about this.
note to self  twincest turns ppl gay.  yeah  that s my comment to feed the algorithm
he s a jedi.  that means he s an incel!
lol
doesn t luke have a wife
u r looking stunning today
nobody is safe
in legends luke is married to a woman  in canon luke is a jedi who never had a relationship with anyone in an intimate sense so.. . the culture of appropriation
what next  vader s his mum   ffs
mara jade. that is all
so carrie fisher confirmed man and first transgender disney princess.
obi wan kenobi and qui gon jinn were gay.
can t we just ask george lucas if he made luke to be gay or not  just because disney bought the ip that doesn t mean understand the character. the last jedi is proof of that.
the opposite
can luke be non binary  transgender and female or etc now because reasons
mara freaking jade
um nope  mara jade!!! period
luke skywalker never seemed interested in women. it s true. if not gay he was asexual. lol han was horny for lei but luke was horny for no one. lol
mara jade disagrees with mark hamill
if luke is gay does that make leia a man
if it s not in lucas s star wars films its disney. therefore i don t regard it as authentic.
luke skywalker married a woman named mara jade. anything that says otherwise is fanfiction to me
this is clearly a joke
luke is not gay is mark insane  are these people insane  they try to say this character has always been gay and that character has always been gay like they did with tim drake robin  but the fact of the matter is that s not the truth at all  tim is straight. luke is straight wth
why is it you never see gay characters turn straight
you know who theyhad to convince forthe star wars seriesto exist..  wokeism.. that s become some90  hollywood and10  idk what to make of itopinion.. but what would i know
also luke isn t gay
we all know mark hammel is a gay actor playing straight characters. he just got confused.
luke skywalker is married to mara jade and they have a son called ben.
well no more sw for me.
what about mara jade n ben skywalker mr. hamil hmmm
luck is not gay.  before disney fucked up star-wars she had a whole wife and a son.  never once in any novel  comic  or movie has he shown any signs of being gay.
as if i needed another reason to not watch modern star wars.
do you smell that  it smells like buuuuuuulllllshiiiiiiiiiit!!!!!!  like wtf  there is so much in canon even that he isn t gay. if they pushed for bi instead  i could believe that. but he definitely likes ladies. no question.
chewbacca is gay too  he has a secret fantasy of interspecies bondage with han solo. come on it s obvious if you know what to look for
he is married to a woman in real life.
@mailtaz  it s called ironic humor.
yea before disney bought star wars and ruined it. like was married with kids in gl canon
more like wokeypedia
mara jade  hello
i give up......
i mean why do u think ellie from the last of us is a lesbian  and why i refuse to play part 2  as far as i am concerned part 1 is all there is to the last of us now  they just wanted to pander to the woke crowd so they made her a lesbian  not that i dislike her as a lesbian though i just hate the reason why they made her a lesbian  she definitely should be bisexual imo .
hvd melonie
trinary anyone
luke isn t gay. kenobi   tarkin aren t gay either. this pandering to the alphabet mafia has to stop.
he may be but han solo is not!
this people are not star wars fans  they are domestic territories.
yikes
wish hamil would have kept out of it. star wars eu is star wars in my opinion. dismal studios can beat feet for all i care.
mara jade
luke is not gay. all evidence is to the contrary.
if luke is gay  let s face it  he s definitely a bottom.
i guess jake skywalker is gay...
if luke was gay  why did he marry mara jade  to pass on his bloodline  he never truly loved her  or what about callista  i suppose he never loved her either. i read lot s of the eu  real star wars   and none of those books made any reference to luke liking dudes. then again  this is disney star wars so i do not really care what they do. i have the expanded universe.
maybe luke isnt gay maybe since he actually likes dudes hes just a transw0man  sarcasm
first obi and now luke   so the original star wars would have gone something more like the family guy star wars  with herbert as obi and chris and luke.. ridiculous!!!!
whatever  lucas film  whatever you say
mara jade who
not star wars are not gay as always
and this is why you dont listen to celebrities  especially ones that thought it was a good idea to work with riana johnson  huh actually daniel craig turns bond gay and now him  funny old world that
is satan gay
dude really gay !  does he now the lore for his own character  does that mean lukes wife mara jade  was a guy
maybe mark hamill is gay but luke isn t why else would he be interested in his sister lol
i agree 100   i am so sick of they them not-he not-she toasters who sexualize everything  leave star wars alone you sex addicts
i mean lara croft has always come off as being a bit lesbianish  she is a bisexual character though which isn t a bad thing at all.
wait  why did he leave his whole life  to save the princess     do gay men care so much about trying to find a princess  obi wan and han were not leading the push to leave their planets to go find leia or the jedi
yes  it s always about the children. why  because if they can make it so children are gay trans etc. then that reaffirms and validates their  i was born this way  narrative instead of it being a choice or mental illness.
everything needs to be a controversy nowdays  characters need to be gay or weirdos will cry. can t enjoy anything anymore without making it a big deal about it
hey it s my birthday today too lol
mark hamill think  he gay but the fact of the matter is what george lucas opinion is what really matters and how he views his creation of star wars and his characters not mark hamill that things he gay or disney but george lucas opinion what matters here
no.
mark hamill might be gay but luke skywalker was not
i m glad lando is white because i see him as white.
remember when lucasfilm said anything not in the movies or the clone wars show was not canon.. peppridge farm remembers.. luke was hard for his sister.. leia was not a dude.
say what luke skywalker isnt gay stop changing all these things
disney  star wars  is gay  not luke!!
again it s reasons like this why i just cut star wars off past 2012. rotj was the conclusion of the saga and everything after that point i d rather just invest in the stories told within the old expanded universe regardless whether their quote   canon   or otherwise it doesn t matter to me. all the crap disney has shat out with star wars is nothing more to me but complete and total fan-fiction  much in the same way amazon s lord of the woke  the rings of broke is with anything professor tolkien wrote in his original stories  including all the nonsense about luke being gay despite all the evidence that proves otherwise.
i really could care less about a character s sexuality... does it even matter lol... come on mark...
luke was into his own sister at first and dated the galaxy s hottest redhead mara jade. sounds like the complete opposite of gay to me but what do i know.actors are pathetic.
he kissed his sister
for christ s sake...... rainbows i m really starting to hate those things aiming this at children is just a sophisticated form of child abuse
chewbacca made luke skywalker gay and into furry.
luke was created by george and he was never a gay end of story..there is no gay in a glaxy far far away
hamill is gay  not luke
mark hamill is one of the worst people in hollywood.
he sure didn t seem gay in the movies either. i mean sure it was his sister  but he didn t know at the time  he sure didn t mind kissing a woman. but lets be honest. this is just another culture war casualty  like muslims building a mosque on the holy site of a conquered enemy.
of course that has been will sell out his only important character for attention from the mob  only way he can be  relevant  with the most noisy minority
why did you get this information from  wokeapedia
the woke continues.... the are so desperate to change characters and classic franchise you can see they don t have any talent only to destroy the good stuff
the legendary jedi master luke skywalker is no where near gay never just leave our legacy characters alone create your own he s not any lgbt abc nope never
george lucas would make that decision not mark hamill. what s next is joker gay too
they really are determined to ruin the franchise forever  aren t they first they said the force was female  when it is an actual force without gender  now mark hamil says his character is gay.what next  padme is transgender  i d like to see how they can prove that impossible logic. and when they pull that card  i ask then a question for the future.when did star wars die   when will they bury the coffin
she kissed him. he never made a move on her lol
why does everything have to be gay to make 5  of the population be comfortable in addition  i think in star wars cannon luke had a wife in the books  mara jade
remember mara jade!!! luke s wife! this is why legends is better.
canonically no-one gave a shit  never heard anyone talking about movie luke being any kind of sexual. this was not an issue  does he feel so irrelevant that he had to bring this up
pretty sure mark is gay
he is not
he she pronouns already exist  gender fluid people would use those pronouns
get star wars away from disney
and don t forget that luke skywalker married a woman.... or have we forgotten about mara jade
luke skywalker is not gay  how much did he hit on leia  that is just stupid for him to say he was gay.
no mark!! don t co-sign this crap!
mark hamill may be gay  but luke skywalker is not.
honestly  i always thought that character was kind of gay.  not related to his sexual preference at all  but there just wasn t much to him.  no depth.  maybe it was the poor acting  but i never felt anything for luke.
dude god of war was fact 80  gameplay literally look it up
lol no he isn t.
nope. during the ot  he had clear interactions with another that clearly showed he was not gay. not so much rotj. if anything  he was nonsexual as  by this point  he was dedicated to his training as a jedi. i would be outraged  but i am tired of this fan fiction. it is not star wars. some of the fan fiction has been good  but mostly it has been terrible and derivative.
is there any point in complaining is you re not willing to solve the problem with lead  they re not going to stop this side of death.
luke skywalker is straight  he fell in love   married mara jade and have children in star wars legends.
mark hamill say dumb stuff again is getting boring.
this has been going on for years. twitter just declares that a character is lgbt. no proof  deflection from any receipts to the contrary  just that s what they are  and if you disagree  you re -ist -phobic. it s stupid. anyone who has read the eu books  canon  not canon  don t care  knows he isn t gay. he married mara jade and had twins with her  and he was into leia before discovering that she was his sister. this isn t about star wars. it s about taking people s fun and joy in a franchise and twisting it into something that will be divisive so fans will leave and let these fools have the space. stand firm and deny them.
we need a new luke skywalker. mark hamill must go !! enough already. count me out !! of any disney movies or property!!
i have become so disappointed with mark. i loved luke skywalker all my life but now i can barely stand to watch star wars
why does this even matter to people. weirdos need to stop sexualizing everything.
if luke is gay then leia is trans.
they are trying to cover up the incest part of luke by giving him a new title how amazing. im sick to death of this culture we live in. like move on come up with an original idea. if there s a community people wanna be supporting it should be the disabled community. what disabled characters are main characters in shows or movies. start making them and thats equality. not altering the past
luke skywalker just says he is gay because as a straight white cis male he won t fit in with his peer group!
luke skywalker got kissed by le a in esb  and flexed in front of han solo and chewy before knowing she was his sister. he definitely isn t gay  and this is only being done to pander and satisfy the woke alphabet community  who really doesn t care about star wars to begin with. truly ridiculous  just like the sequel trilogy.
lol  so high school bullies and fans of star trek have been right all along. it is almost as funny as soccer coming out as gay... like duh  we already knew that
the force is female ... gay
if it doesn t come from george lucas then it isn t canon. disney star wars was already not canon and whatever mark hamill says to appease the left on twitter isn t canon as far as luke skywalker
so mark hamil is complicit again in the destruction of the character he once played  why am i not surprised. and no luke skywalker was not gay ever. period.
yeah no sorry definitely not
everyone knows that luke is both a woman and a lesbian.
mara jade is a guy  how does that explain their son ben skywalker
lmao  i don t even care anymore. star wars is dead and disney killed it.
maybe luke is a non binary transwookie who identifies as gay.
luke skywalker sexuality is the last thing i care about really and people who care about that are in no way fans of this universe!the only thing i want see luke swing is a light saber so those woke creep should go get some other franchise to destroy.
just claim everything mouse has released in their history so far be  lgbtq coded  and turn everyone gay  including bambi  and be done with it.
firstly  luke skywalker is absolutely not the most iconic star wars character  that title will always be attributed to anakin vader.secondly  who the fuck gives a shit  was luke skywalker ever in a romantic relationship in canon  the only thing we know is that he was attracted to a woman.
luke skywalker was not gay.  it s disgusting how far our degenerate society has fallen.
the last time when i seen luke skywalker he kissed princess leia he liked it he was straight. keep him straight. don t change his sexuality in order to push an agenda of woke identity politics. if you re worried about inclusivity make him a supporter of lgbt people at least. but don t make him gay himself because that s just pushing an agenda and that has nothing to do with the story of star wars. what someone s sexuality is has nothing to do with the star wars narrative of the story and what the people in the story go through as a whole as a people in a galaxy far far away. that s just pushing an agenda. i don t care about a character s sexuality just tell the goddamn story of what happens to the people in a galaxy far far away between the good guys and the bad guys. a person s sexuality has nothing to do with it. leave identity politics out of it it has nothing to do with the story and it shits up the story. i m saying this as a woman   who is a supporter of lgbt people. keep woke identity politics out of regular storytelling and entertainment because that s how you fuck up entertainment. keep your shit out of regular storytelling. keep your politics out of regular entertainment. keep it a separate thing.the same way the lgbt community doesn t want straight people pushing their straight agenda and their sexuality on them they have to get the straight community that same respect.there must be a balance between the two between the lgbt community and the straight community. there must be an equal balance between the two. not one scale tipping over or under the other because of their sexuality. there must be a balance.even raven-symone from that s so raven told disney to keep her sexuality as a lesbian out of her character in the story line of that so raven. because what her sexuality is has nothing to do with the overall narrative of the story. this is in her own words.
all of these individuals care nothing of canon  just inserting they cult hate and violent views.
lol.the only story canon for sw is pre disney purchase. so it means f all to me. lmaodisney is pure cringe. haha
let me guess  next indiana jones is now a transwoman
so princess leia was a man then    no mark  don t be stupid.
mark hamill has always been a kiss ass to the hollywood elite  i was done with him years ago. time for sebastian stan to be cast any time they need luke  he does not deserve that role.
star wars has lost most of its cultural relevance. nobody cares if luke skywalker is gay. theres nothing in the source material to suggest that.  in fact  doesn t he have a daughter in the extended universe books   this is just dumbledore all over again
so sick of this crap.
luke made out with his sister and in the old books or true canon before disney murder it he was married and had a son. can the woke please stop ruining everything you touch
how amazing is it that the character of luke skywalker is far better in character and values then the actor who plays him. just like captain america woke mob writers have no talent. they are incapable of creating new characters who have depth and nuance  much less able to create an original story. and if they did  their audience would be only those within that niche. that s why they hijack popular stories and characters in an attempt to cash in an established fan-base while trying to lecture   indoctrinate them. they really don t care about the actual stories or hobbies the fans care about. no wonder why indie movies  comics  and games are exploding in popularity.
mark hamill is a waste of space.
disney star wars is not star wars.  your problem is you re conflating the two.  they are entirely incompatible.  disney star wars conflicts with real star wars in innumerable ways  because they are entirely separate.  indeed  disney star wars is to star wars as the dark side is to the light side of the force.  one represents the best in us  and the other the absolute worst.
they already ruined star wars im not watching anything else disney ruins. anything they release u can guarantee its gonna be boring af no story and tons of messaging thats their new formula. get rid of storylines and replace it with woke massaging and replace everyone s race and gender identity
oh no clown world is getting out of hand quickly call batman no wait they him then call super man no wait they ruined him to ok get thanos
no he is not. end of story.
who cares  it s not his decision. it s a super hero. he can be whatever you want
don t know  don t care
its official star wars is dead to me.......
if you read the aftermath trilogy novels they have gay and lesbian characters. it was super obnoxious. obi-wan kenobi is bi and now luke skywalker
this is a huge nothingburger  it only matters if lucasfilm actually start making luke act gay in official sw content.
star wars has been long past dead and yet people will tune into crap like the blandalorian rewarding the same studio and wonder why these things keep going
mark hamill  luke is gayentire legends  prove otherwise married to jade and got childrento be honest i lost interest in star wars with book of boba fett star wars can go and die for all i care. skywalker was one of my fav characters  now not anymore. nerd  gaming and plenty of fandoms and og ip s are dying cause of these minority pushing their bs
i don t consider disney star wars as canon. star wars is the og trilogy  the prequals and the expanded universe from before disney took over.
yet another reason to not care about star wars anymore...
every day i pray for jesus to return and end all of this trash. i don t understand why these people are so obsessed with sexuality of fictional characters.
this is how the byzantines demoralized a conquered nation.
of course  a nephew murderer now gay  what s next. anyway he and his father are big failure  only the brave waman could be chosen one.
what ! luke skywalker is not a gay! he runs save leia because she is pretty and likes when she kiss him. he married mara jade. and why is tarkin listed as lgbt ! he likes women and daala is his lover! that is definetly stupid woke trash madness.
luke skywalker is so gay he got himself a beautiful redhead woman named mara jade and they had a son named ben skywalker
no  mark is gay and wishes the character luke was.
luke was never gaythat s just disney propaganda
star wars is dead. nobody important watches any of it anymore.  whatever they do does not count  because the only movies and books that matter all happened before disney took over.  so everything after disney  does not count imo.
luke guywalker. yuck.
really  luke is gay huh  and he didn t shoot his shot with han  i don t buy it for a second.
star wars in it s entirety is pretty gay  let s not lie to ourselves.
luke is gay and gay people try and make out with women sisters  cause that s how they know they are gay.... if they try and make out with their sister they are gay
luke skywalker is married to mara jade. disney leave our legacy characters alone same to you dc comics.
yeah star wars is dead
who cares if he s gay   it changes nothing.  you say mark hamill is using luke for clout with the left  it could just as easily be said you are using his name for clout with the right.  you say you don t care  then make a 20 min video
star wars keeps getting worse
mark hamill is gay. luke skywalker definitely not.
no  luke is not gay  get out of here mark  i m done with star wars until they get their sh t together.
do you stand for anything other than making a quick buck off of industry drama melonie
so what  luke is a pickle puffer. who cares anymore  i buried star wars  star trek   dr who in the same grave. rip
haiyaa
gay  straight  who cares.
i was done with it when dismal studios took it over. eu star wars is star wars in my opinion.
who cares star wars is ruined. mark hamill doesn t care anymore they destroyed his character.
just another reason to hate star wars and everything associated with it.
star wars is dead!
star wars is dead  sooo... sure why not  luke is gay now  yoda is clown gender and jabba is now a transgender lesbian. good luck with that next star wars movie disney  i m sure it will be a big success.
mark hamill was once an incredible actor both live and voice. but now he bows to the lgbtq crowd. why does everything have to be gay or trans or whatever else  its a joke. this is why i don t watch movies in cinemas anymore  its why disney is hemorrhaging money and why many games  movies and tv series are failing. sick of it now. the minority is now running the majority.
what a ridiculous premise. mark hamill is a complete pos. the best entertainment moment in 2022 was the return in the mandalorian. i thought it was great they brought back mark for that moment. but mark has ruined that. ps-is someone spamming a fake account of you over on telegram  i got linked via one of your previous posts and now i m getting messages and supposedly won a prize. feels very much like an internet scam.
lame af
umm mark hamill is gay. luke skywalker .. is a badass .. separate the 2 .. for the love of god stop it the   the disney sequel s  sucked objectively and the sexuality doesn t matter. wtf!
star wars is dead
dude has always been gay. wasn t that obvious
to be brutally honest i don t care anymore. luke skywalker is dead  disney deconstructed then killed the hero. star wars is dead. let the merch gather dust on shelves  let disney sink money into a already sunken ship. the woke mob can keep it. we can create new entertainment
star wars trash anyway
mohammed the prophet is gay.
when he was sexually attracted to leia  i don t think it was obvious.
