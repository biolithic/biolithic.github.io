i was an icu rn caring for intubated covid patients . left that position a few months ago. i just wanted to tell you that i agree with everything you have stated and want to encourage you to continue what you are doing because it matters!! god bless you and stay encouraged! what you are doing matters!
i was suffering from  something .  my intuition said it had something to do with my endocrine system.  i saw 15 different drs and specialists who just dismissed the symptoms and would only check my thyroid level.  in the end  a nurse who lived diagonally across the street watched me sliding into a form of madness...she came over with a scrap of paper and told me to insist that these two tests be performed. the dr did not want to  but my husband who went with me  insisted and the md finally relented.  the tests confirmed that i had a parathyroid tumor that was reading at the time of removal at 1374 rather than a normal rate of about 31.  the surgeon wrote a letter to every single one of those mds  including an endocrinologist  to inform them of their neglect.  i am alive today because of a dedicated nurse who was not afraid to slip me that piece of paper. what kind of screwed up world is this
when i refused chemo they forced me to get  end of life counseling  because they said i would not survive 5 years.  it was a psychiatric evaluation to see if i understood what death meant and to scaremonger me to get chemo.  i am a person who the harder you pressure me  the more i push back.  that was in 2002.  by the grace of god almighty  i was found to be cancer free after giving birth to my child in 2003.  i refused chemo to save my baby.  in return  god saved me from cancer.i never lied to my providers.  i just avoided them and cared for my family directly as much as possible.
i was told my son was not alive  and the doctor wanted to schedule a d c. i listened to the holy spirit. my son is now 11 years old. god is good!
thank you so much for speaking out about this. last year our pediatrician that we have loved for years offered the covid shot  and we declined. she then told my then 13 year old son that it was important he get his meningitis shot as well as a booster of two others. i politely told her we wouldn t be doing any injections today  and we d discuss it at home. she then turned to my son and told him directly  ok  well buddy...i understand that you didn t anticipate getting any shots today  but just know that at your next visit it won t be an option. it will barely be a pinch  i promise.   uhhhhhhh excuse me ! ! i was horrified that she felt so brazen to say that. weeks later we received two messages that the boys were not up to date on their immunizations  and to give them a call to get scheduled. we never went back. i have moved our family to a naturopath. trust your god given intuition parents!! you re not wrong
had my annual exam with my new doctor a week ago  we just moved to tn . i am a nurse with 27 years experience. he knows my philosophy is an holistic approach with medical interventions only as necessary. i have declined a few suggestions much to his dismay. he mentioned the pneumonia vaccine for me this year. i asked if it had mrna in it and man alive did he go unhinged!  i suggested we were having a collegial discussion  someone has to be the adult   and he asked if i trusted him. i said i trust you but do not mistake that for obedience . i asked for the name of his suggested vaccines and said i would do my own research. he has said if i don t agree with him i am free to change doctors. while i know this to be true  it seems like a terribly juvenile approach to patient care.as a nurse i have treated patients who have done less than stellar things in their lives. i always treated them with dignity and respect. sad this is what s happening in healthcare
i m grateful to see you back! quick story. just a year or two ago  we took my son  he s 13 now  for a regular physical for school. his pediatrician  who was actually my wife s pediatrician  came in the room  mask  face shield  gloved up. i made the joke it looked like he was preparing for a space walk  not a physical. he was not amused. he started pushing the jab for our son. i said  nope . my son s an athlete. the doctor got a little uppity  i know what s best mentality . we left without my son being jabbed and i told my wife  time to find another pediatrician .
i m a pure blood retired army veteran who s also a federal government employee.  last year  after i got co id  my employer required that i  and all post co id employees  get a letter from the doctor clearing them to go back to work. my primary care doctor refused to write me the letter even though i had proof for her of when i had tested positive. i had stayed home 14 days  even though i was only sick for 1 week  to ensure that i was not spreading it. she refused to write the letter because   you did not take the jab.  needless to say  she s no longer my primary care doctor  and i gave her a piece of my mind.
thank heavens i was exposed early to these kinds of healthcare providers and started learning to advocate for myself a couple decades ago! the first time i was bullied was a family care doctor who actually confronted me about  isn t it time to get your child off the breast   my daughter was not quite 2 years old  mainly nursing for comfort  not really for food   and at the 90th percentile for height and 80th percentile for weight on the growth charts! my jaw hit the floor and i asked back   do you tell bottle-feeding parents to completely wean off bottle at this age   no  the doctor was just uncomfortable with toddlers nursing. i remain unjabbed and off all rx medication at age 53  grow my own veggies   herbs   eggs  and get plenty of exercise. i may be carrying 25 extra pounds but it s from good homemade food that s as unprocessed as i can prepare it. i started working out more when i realized i didn t want to be diabetic   practically crippled in my 70s like my sedentary mother is.
retired nurse here. several years ago my normally very healthy husband complained of some mild shortness of breath. he went to a local urgent care and the doctor told him he was having an asthma attack. after the visit an older nurse followed him to the parking lot and begged him to go to er. he called me and i said trust the nurse. thank heavens he did  he had bilateral pulmonary emboli and was very sick. that nurse saved his life. sadly  today i dont think many nurses have the bravery  brains  or intuition to have recognized his issue. have lost respect for most in my once proud profession.
at one time we told a brain surgeon that we didn t feel comfortable about a surgery for our sister  daughter . none of us felt good about it   the next day   30 yrs ago  . he came to tell us he had made a mistake   she would have died . it is good to pray and know that we have wisdom from above !
nurse   for over 20 years. lastly  deposited myself in icu . gave everything to my patients despite the administration s views. had to leave because of the mandate and it killed me to know that i would not be there for my dying patients  nursing is an art but currently it s just another license to be squeezed out of life.
if you have to be bullied  coerced  or shamed into participating in a medical procedure that could drastically change your life  it s probably not in your best interest to do so.
first of all i want say that as a fellow nurse i so appreciate what you are doing and agree with what you are saying here . i have to tell a pertinent story here about listening to our gut or as a christian  god. i was a school nurse in 2018-jan 2020. this job was contracted through our local giant healthcare conglomerate. i had good health insurance and benefits but my job was overwhelming. i prayed a lot whether to stay with it or not. i chose to listen to what i know god was telling me to do and left that job feb 6  2020 to go to one with no benefits  but that was much simpler and with a much smaller corporation. immediately after i left came the disease and all of the insanity. that giant conglomerate required the jab. the smaller corporation i went to allowed religious exemptions and so i have been able to work the whole time. also  it allowed for overtime instead of being a salaried position so i m making sometimes a lot more money than i was at the previous job. lastly  i don t think god wanted me to have the health insurance because i don t have any underlying conditions and am a very healthy person. he wants me to rely on him
i am a healthy  active  torah observant 68 year old off grid homesteader on social security with humana healthcare as my medicare advantage health provider. i don t use them because i am all of the above  but hang onto coverage in case of a medical emergency  although i really can t imagine anything the most high can t protect me from. i have had to fight with them for two years to finally get them to stop writing  texting  emailing and calling me - trying to lure me into colonoscopies  mammograms and whatever else they could come up with to get me into a medical facility. i kept telling them   you are my insurance company - if and when i need you  i ll call you.  the last one i finally had to say   you are becoming like stalkers and you need to stop or i will cancel my coverage.  i haven t heard from them again in a while. they do not like people like me  and especially people like you.
you re right in 2021 i went back to my pain dr located inside a hospital. i refused the mask because of medical conditions and ptsd. they let me pay and get in the room. the nurse had the problem with me not my actual dr. it was a follow up appt for a spine procedure i had in the same hospital. dr didn t believe in the masks or the v either. i never got to see him and was escorted out of the hospital by security. i was so upset and humiliated. i ve never been back and will never trust the industrial medical complex ever again! that was traumatic as it was. drs just care about their bonuses not our lives. customers not cures!
i thank god that i listened to my intuition and refused the jab  despite overwhelming pressure from so called friends and family.  i am now very wary of any dealings with the medical industry. i have educated myself to have an ability to avoid it if at all possible !i love you and your channel pn! thanks for all that you do for us.  o  xx
in late 2020  i had a very infected toe  brought on by a very bad toe procedure. i went to an urgent care clinic. it had outside c testing and a drive- thru for the jab. i noticed that nonsense. when the dr. finally came into my room  every symptom i told him i was experiencing  because of my toe infection  fatigue  fever  very sore toe   he said   that s a c symptom ! finally  i got so fed up with his b.s. because he was not listening to me  i yelled at him    i do not have  c - i do have a very infected toe  however . he was shocked  and acted like he was going to get security. i deescalated after i saw i had gotten his attention. then  i was able to get him to address my toe  only after all that.  i have never in my life yelled at a doctor  like that  before.  it made an impression on me  that most doctors are gung-ho on this c crap  and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. there are some good ones  but you have to use your instinct to evaluate where they re coming from.
i had a physician actually refuse to see my child because i refused to do exactly what he said because i called him on his garbage and wasn t going to feed his god complex. and i absolutely agree with you! we are our own  and our families best advocates in all the things. we need to remember that and fight the fight regardless of outcome. thank you so much patriot nurse for another amazing video.
i haven t worked in the medical field since the big c hit in 2020.  i personally find it extremely scary to even go to a doctor or hospital.  even last december  i was super sick and had a pretty strong headache for several days  even waking up with one.  when i went to the er  did they even concern themselves with a possible stroke.  i have high blood pressure.  my dad had it and he died from a cerebral anyerism.  my sister also has htn.  8-10 hours of waiting in the waiting room  they brought me back and the first thing they were worried about was testing me for the thing.  my bp was 220 189.  they didn t even flinch about that  my family history  the fact that i d wake up with that headache -- anything but the big c and testing for that.  ticked me off beyond belief that i had to ask them if they were going to do anything about my bp.  anyway  i would not even get that test by any means.  don t trust those tests either.it s so sad to see where the medical field has gone.  they only care about making that huge reimbursement for the big c vs taking care of people.
did you see questionable practices during your employment during covid
@salongirlgardens  hope you are doing well
i keep my own council thank you .
ddj - 100
god bless you sir. my brother is still suffering residual damage from incorrect treatment.  one reason of several i believe family and advocates of the patients hospitalized is that the nurses and doctors could do exactly as they re told per negligent protocol  without challenge  hindrances nor interference. i know of several otherwise healthy patients in whom died as a result of intentional  misdiagnosis encouraged economically along with experimental unproven  treatments protected by hired guns in the way of citizens tax dollars paying for ramped up bogus hospital security and law enforcement.  i m sure as an icu nurse you had to endure and experience situations that were otherwise unacceptable.  scientifically.  morally and logically.  my heart goes out to medical personnel in whom are caught in the labyrinth of incomprehensible rules.
soooo- what you re really saying is that you have been complicit to  how many deaths  due to medical malpractice for the last three years  gotcha. guess the money was good while it lasted.
my sister was doing that   giving the sedative and remdesvir.. the kill drugs
@micksheeto9438  holy moly.  is she still
@micksheeto9438  my husband was given remdesivir in the hospital for covid and recovered.
i left the bedside too. sick of woke doctors and residents
@jesskan9828  it causes kidney failure. it doesn t happen immediately the damage won t be evident right away.
we need to start up medical offices  an hospitals for all nurses an doctors who walked away from the evil.. asap
i worked at a hospital in housekeeping for 20 yrs  the entire year of 2020  i was put in charge of cleaning icu covid rooms. the things i witnessed were  definitely an eye opener for me. i stuck it out until they told me i had to get the jab or get fired.
i worked the icu s and er s of chicago for 25 years. i know what you witnessed. jesus loves you so much.we must be take very good care of our selfs to avoid being stuck in one of these places..blessings
@kanesmom7830  kudos to you for not taking the jab!
@bradcampbell5766  i was forced to use bleach on everything. by the end of my shift i felt like i was going to pass out even though i was masked for the entire shift. i don t wish anyone to experience the pure hell i went through. feel sorry for all my coworkers.
i personally messed up before and didn t listen to my intuition!! i still hate that i did that.... work on your inner gut feeling people... it will to you a lot of good bc that s the conscience god gave us
@micksheeto9438  shame!
@bp-ge9sj  given his track record  yes  he should be held responsible for the protocol  and for the  gain of fu  tion   and for the  leak  in wahun  sic   and for doing people in with azt.
tracy  what were the tests
what was this  something
i mean what did you experience.
praise god!
dear god. i m sorry.
that s a killer awful story but reality seems to be that we ve come to expect neglect and mistakes   just recently a friend was told she had a benign tumor  no big deal  for years only to discover it was actually a hernia.  that doesn t seem like a super challenging diagnosis.  i started realizing i was going to need to advocate for myself when my first ob-gyn  36 years ago   very clearly was unable to contain his disdain after learning i d had an abortion.  he didn t totally neglect me  but his attitude was so poor that--i think--we very nearly had a tragedy at the birth.   he put me to sleep even though i had a fresh epidural--i think--because he didn t want me to freak out when if my baby proved to be damaged  after hours of his  don t be such a big baby  treatment of me.   people were all   what s wrong with you   when i just said no to this v  but when i started adding stuff up  it was like  maybe 50  of the significant medical experiences i had had in my 59 years went  off  somehow  and i figured i could survive covid  so why
a satanic one.
please share what the symptoms   tests were if you feel comfortable
hypo thyroidism  low t3  low active thyroid     this causes a lot of hidden problems  like low testosterone  estrogen  menopause  cysts  cold hands and feet  aching muscles  arthritis  headaches  swelling  plaque psoriasis  flaky skin  ect.
and they will barely check the thyroid level.
@soonersciencenerd383  and what is the treatment for that usually
im so happy that you got surgery.i went to  only 4 mds before being diagnosed correctly for hyperparathyroidism.
this happened to me!  at least 22 years ago  a nurse told me that not all people do well on synthetic thyroid medication.  i felt terrible on synthetic and knew instinctively something was wrong.  she told me what to ask for.  also  because at the time of testing  with another doctor    paper  test orders were still being used  so  i marked off the t3 tests on my own orders!  this was a turning point in getting myself help!  even recently  i had a doctor tell me something very innnacurate regarding my dessicated thryoid medication and how it works.  i know  after over 20 years  my own body and how it works with regard to medication.  it is difficult  even now  to get new providers to prescribe a complete thyroid panel  since i know tsh is often a completely inadequate test.  and now they insist on a test every three months  even if i am feeling great.  very expensive and unnecessary testing and often the wrong test  ask for a complete thyroid panel if you do need testing.
i m a nurse it is screwed up  just want to confirm your assessment of what happened to you  my mom taught nursing x 35 years and my sister is a nurse too  we are besides ourselves with the medical community
aww i m so glad she helped you!
@rollingwiththepunches1988  a lot of the time the dismissal is about the demeanor of the patient  us women. we don t always ask the right questions or speak up much at all when asking what s wrong with us. also our symptoms aren t always clear so we don t list all the things wrong with us when telling medical professionals what s wrong with us for any number of reasons. that said   i have had better treatment maybe bc my mom has been a registered nurse all my life so i have had experience trying to tell people my symptoms when something s wrong.
i see that today.  doctors have only a few minutes to discuss your issue.  then a quick diagnosis and off to the next patient.  it really pisses me off.
wow. i believe it.
@jillyinsd8343  another nurse here and you are spot on. i ve been in this 40 yrs and there is so much bad medical care it scares me.
very screwed up.thanks for your messege
it is a world where money rules the outcome of everything.... sadly.
thank god for that nurse and all i have to say is i hope all these doctors burn in hell i am so sick and tired of doctors not listening and not paying attention when a patient says something s wrong with my body. who better than the patient knows  i was laughed out of the doctor s office in my thirties when i asked him about the symptoms of menopause i had been having occasional hot flashes and i thought i was a little bit too young for that never heard of perimenopause before but the doctor looked at me and laughed in my face and said come back in 10 years. i went home and jumped online and found a women s form this was back in the 90s when you could just walk in and ask a question without registering and waiting for approval anyway i asked a question in this form and these kind women informed me about perimenopause which i had never heard of. i started actual menopause at the age of 42. so to my doctor he can what in hell t o o
may the creator of the universe bless the nurses!
@rollingwiththepunches1988  believe me  m am  it happens to men  too.  bee-leeeeve me! lol.i m 60 and need to lose 40 lbs. other than a recent colonoscopy  i haven t been to one in yrs. when i was 56 and somewhat less overweight  i noticed they literally don t listen to anything i said.  not the first time  of course.and this is all pre-covid.
sue them and sue them hard a law suit suing.
i m glad that nurse was there for you.
there are a few good men and women out there.  however  it seems less and less will either speak out or hand you a piece of paper like your friend did.  i was an elementary school teacher and grade 4 was my speciality.  if children didnt like school from k - 3  then i had the skills  the will and heart to help and create environment rich with love  caring and respect.  it seems respect and certainly intuition is so important.  i say  start listening to your intuition now!   practice it on a daily basis and you will see that it is the highest form of knowing.   thank you patriot nurse for your last point of the interview with the doc.
great to hear that were able to determine the root cause of your illness with the help of a dedicated nurse.  i am going through something similar  although my issue is not life threatening  and after finally finding a doctor that would listen to me i am seeking legal help to sue.   i know it does not sound good but i think it is the only way to wake up the medical community.
praise god for the nurses!
omg this is my story except it was pituitary tumor.with no giantism......
@tmaddrummer  most sadly do what they are told.
@helenmowat7018  and also law enforcement.
1 9 2023. it is the kind of world where we thank god we have neighbors like yours.
@tmaddrummer  i dont know what you mean  the solution is that men and woman must get back to law.
@helenmowat7018  my response to you was because you said  most nurses do what they are told.   i said also law enforcement  meaning that they too often do what they are told regardless of violating civil rights and or not abiding with our constitution.  i do agree that as you said  men and women must get back to law  and i would add more importantly that all people repent to god and follow his law and his son jesus christ... hallelujah!
you re just beginning to find out.
i can t tell you how many times i ve heard this story actually this exact story a client kept telling her dr. as he kept sweeping away she had a tumor on thyroid too.i don t understand why dr. don t air on side of caution just get it tested!  if you aren t your own advocate you re good as gone
@tracyk you just described my mom s story. she felt like she was going crazy and felt her body dying. they finally diagnosed her with sjogrens and a parathyroid tumor! she flew down to florida to have it removed. i hope you are healing  my mom definitely is!
i was having pain under my boob area and around my back. i would double over. this was when i was 40. i am 59 now. i told my doctor  and she asked if i was spitting up blood. i said no. she palpatated the area and said it was probably nothing. well  i had another flare-up at my mom s. mom looked at me and said it s your gallbladder. when you see your doctor again demand an ultrasound. if she refuses  tell her you will find a doctor who will. well  i went to my appointment i had told her that my mom believes it s my gallbladder and i need an ultrasound and i also told the doctor if she won t order one...i will find a doctor that will do one. she rolled her eyes at me and said. i guess we better make your mom happy. so i got the ultrasound. what i had was a gallstone  the size of a very big goose egg. she called to apologize and gave me my choices. i chose getting it removed. she referred me to a really good surgeon. he was surprised i was functional. i told him the pain would come and go. i had my surgery  and i fired the lady doctor. i never went back to see her. i have no problems firing doctors.
this s some hanes times got to stay vigilant and keep good hygiene
@rollingwiththepunches1988  yes and not just med community. there is risk of being characterized. it takes intuitiveness to perceive a doctor s opinion of you and then skill at circumventing it. many of us are on our own which is a factor in the opinion. we are vulnerable to being viewed as in need of a psychiatrist and even moreso if you show any agitation  etc  with their words.
@patriotpam581  not to mention community health services. none of my experiences have been favorable including teeth cleaning.
@soonersciencenerd383 sounds like you re reading my medical record always told my thyroid is fine but zero testosterone and all the rest of those symptoms
@revoltiz1  sorry to hear that. my parents were the same. check on yt  dr. howard hagglund   thyroid  and it can help you out a bit. and  hypothyroidism
yes my two daughters   nurses  watch out for their patients and even those around outside their scope of duty.
get together and open your own office to help people please
this is the kind of world where just a minuscule  practically immeasurable  difference in gravity and there would be no world to exist. it s a world where god sent his only son to save his creation and conquer death once and for all. this is the world where you and i have free will  and we are made in the image of god. a world where we have a purpose while we are here  and although things don t always make sense to us  it is up to the individual to decide if god is in control or if he is not. you are alive today because of a piece of paper was given by a neighbor  or maybe it s because of something even greater  this is the kind of world where i pray that we all thank god. he made this day  so be glad in it.
very screwed up! i am on chemo and am being as careful as i can to not end up in hospital for anything!
a world where few possess empathy compassion  reasonable logic and conviction where others do not do others any harm.
that is strong faith sister!  god bless you !
haha good for you! i m one of those push back people too
very encouraging testimony...     that s the difference between having faith in god and faith in mankind.  my faith in god means that i would rather be in heaven than down here anyway  so i m not holding on to their idea of  life .  for mercy s sake  some people are crippled to death in pain and downing 28 pills daily to keep them alive  and they hold on to their  happiness  and love their lives  so they say .  god bless you!
@denisekay4292  i just wanted my baby to be born safely.  we were told her father could not have children.  i knew she was a blessing from god.  i prayed to god every single day to just let me live long enough to give birth and i would start chemo then if he allowed me that long.  he did one better  he cured me entirely.  god is good.  he cured me and allowed me to live through the pregnancy with cancer and survived the flu as well while pregnant with cancer.
@d.mitchell913 god bless you and your child. beautiful encounter with the lord.
incredible. god bless you. i m such a baby.
you are blessed!  praised god... hallelujah!
yes they pulled this with me   32 yrs ago   and i have a beautiful and talented  healthy son  they think they are god   they are not!!!
ptl!
@d.mitchell913  you should definitely write ur testimony!
hallelujah
hallelujah! praise the lord!

i told my doctor if i ever get cancer  i am doing nothing about it. i will get my affairs in order and live life to my end. there is nothing left here on this earth for me. it s just my dog and me. once she is gone  i am not getting another pet.
you are the real deal.
@willkaren4ver  i completely understand this mindset.
this is how it s done. absolutely!!   awesome decision and you have a wonderful life ahead of you!!!!!
god bless you and thank god for giving you discernment.
hospitals doctors  bonused  make an estimated  250k per chemo patient and an estimated  369 total per patient for radiation  chemo  surgery.
a neighbor and her mother both got diagnosed with breast cancer about ten years ago. the daughter got chemo  the mother declined. the daughter died shortly after starting chemo. the mother is still alive.
good...for...you...and the baby! praise the living god!
glory to god  mrs.!!!
wow!!
wow. wonderful. i am speechless. you re awesome.
i was pregnant with my fourth child  and discovered i was in a abusive marriage  so i and my 3 kids went to live in a shelter. the thought of abortion passed my mind  as i was scared and overwhelmed. but i knew it was wrong. so i trusted god  and had the baby. he s now 24  with a business degree and engaged. he s doing great! god is faithful!
wtheck  told your son was dead  how did god manage to give him back  it s not something you hear everyday. you need to write a book. god is good!
you are blessed with your son  a true gift from god... hallelujah!
i 100 believe this. many of us were told our babies were potentially going to have down syndrome and encouraged to seek alternatives at 20 weeks nope. our beautiful son is 10 yrs old and no down syndrome  same thing happened to some of my friends and one aunt.
the dr that wanted to do this is evil
the first report is never the last report. it is good that you have faith in god and i m sure your son is glad as well.
you precious lady!  god is great!
my dad wanted me aborted in 1961. he probably thought i d be born sicker than my brother due to rh factor. my mom didn t listen and i was born in 1962!
in my 4th month  i was told by two interns and a nurse that i was miscarrying.  i asked if my baby was still alive.  i was told that my baby was either dead or dying.  they gave me some papers to read and put me on a gurney  preparing to wheel me in to the or for a d c.  i told them that i don t believe in abortion and to not do anything while my baby is still alive.  the intern seemed annoyed.  i was told that the ultrasound machine was in a room all the way down the hall.  my sister was with me and she kept pushing for him to get the machine to honor my wish.  he reluctantly got it and performed the ultrasound.  after being quiet for a while as he looked at it  perhaps struggling with his conscience  he finally told me that my baby was still alive and immediately ordered a hospital bed for me.  ultimately  i gave birth to a healthy baby.
@12stick  how horrendously scary. ugh  that had to have been a full nightmare. horrible. thank you for sharing that  these stories have certainly opened my eyes!
amazing story to tell and retell!!!
@debihester7284  amazing story to tell and retell!!!
@sherryporsch9349  she was pregnant and told that her baby was dead.   docs wanted to remove  dead fetus !   not unusual  if genuine.  but her baby was still alive.  thank god she did not agree to the abortion.
glory to god in the highest!!
maam. what s a d c   and was your son dead or on his way to dying because of doctors negligence  praise god you re in tune with the holy spirit.
i m trying not to punch a wall after reading this.
i know it s not the same  but i m having a very hard time finding a veterinarian who won t push massive amounts of vaccines on my dogs. i loved my vet. he was great but at a certain point  all the vet techs told me he wouldn t see my doggies anymore because they aren t  up to date on vaxes . i do the initial puppy ones and i take extremely good care of them  taking them in for checkups   teeth cleanings  etc. i just don t want them pumped full of unnecessary toxins.
often  as my children were at the peds  the bottom of their charts were  mom  difficult    lol
@debbiehopper5288  i noticed on the chart notes too  they would note  parent refused vaccine . not declined  not said no to...but refused. their language has meaning. it s scary
this is monster behavior  omg
i was a nurse for 25 years and found most doctors automatically dismissed my suggestions concerning my husband who had dementia  several cancers   bone cancer as a met which was untreated due to adverse reactions to his chemo meds   parkinson s and the aftermath of shingles in the right eye.  they would ask him have you had pain and he always answered no.  i would speak up and tell them he complains of pain everyday and takes medication for it and i would be told to let him answer the questions!  he wasn t able to answer them.  as a result i felt he had very poor care with the exception of his pain management doctor.  the lack of compassion was astonishing.
@mariejasminedarling4138  i hear you. plus they just make a lot of money off the pet shots. they don t want people that don t bring them profit.
@martinmummert5614  well  i m jewish so i m glad i m circumcised. no problems down there  either. just my take ...
@garrett621  i m a christian who believes circumcision had a great purpose for old testament jews.  god needed men of extremely strong faith to record and preserve sacred scripture over the centuries...men who believed in god so firmly that they d obediently perform painful  risky surgery on their newborn sons  sometimes with a sharp stone.  but that dispensation has passed.  we re now living in the church age  the age of grace.  we no longer live under old testament law.  the purpose of the law was to prove once and for all that no man could keep it perfectly.   we no longer have to work for our salvation as did old testament jews.  jesus christ paid the wages for our sins on the cross.  all we must do is repent toward god  admit we re hell-bound sinners who can t save ourselves  and call on jesus to grant us the free gift of eternal salivation.
good for you!
@martinmummert5614  okay  good.
@mariejasminedarling4138   yes  the same is happening in vet care.  so hard to find anyone not involved with pharma.  fortunately  i ve become my own doctor and that of my three dogs.  it s all about preventative care.  we are all animal based eaters  little to no plant foods  and doing great.  for an emergency find the best vet in a box in your area  mine is 45 minutes away  but will not consider any of the quacks near by .  i ve found an excellent vet that does teeth cleaning with no anesthesia  it s pricey but well worth it and fortunately only one of my dogs needs this done once per year.  best of luck!
@mariejasminedarling4138  yes it s corrupted them as well. we are unable to board our dog or get him professionally groomed.
our family did this  we only got our pets the initial vacs when they were pups   kittens and they lived to a good old age  my aunt on the other hand got her cats the yearly vacs and they all died young and had at midlife kidney disease  cancers thyroid problems and were never away from the vets  but our animals were rarely at the vets apart from teeth cleaning in older age. i do the same now for my pets and they haven t needed a vet apart from the teeth cleaning for my cat.
@mariejasminedarling4138  - same. i have a 6 mth  2pds! and 1 yr old maltese. vet keeps pushing and pushing and  explaining  the science and the reasons why they need this and that. there last week for a booster and he was annoyed that i demanded her rabies not be given with the booster  i d bring her back in a few weeks. my 2x  husband  highly intelligent   successful     once  super healthy  0 prescription meds  extreme athlete  high angle rescue tech  runner  etc etc   please note the word once   thinks i m crazy for thinking  everyone  is out to  get me .  i m getting tired of fighting and everyone thinking i m the crazy one. it s super exhausting! pzr owns the pet pharmaceuticals industry as well. it s sickening.
@debbiehopper5288   all kids grand babies need difficult moms  and grandmas ! who else is gonna stand up for them! ! !
@wendyrandall  i hope your husband remains in good health  but be prepared.
@cathiwim  oh no  his health had already declined significantly. after numerous test  dr s   specialists etc   all the results were good  some even great! still not feeling well they decided as last resort to do a sleep study thought they were  certain  he wasn t a candidate . diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and placed on a machine  . though we have never tested i m certain he s had the crude at least 3x. i did not fall for the charade for even a second. we never changed our lifestyle in live and work in a small home  slept in the same bed etc. i ve not had as much as a sniffle for as long as i can remember . per the usual for most who attended the  it is not discussed in our home and every issue that arises for him is easily explained away by something unrelated to the poison. i just bite my tongue now and rock on. on the upside he refuses the boosters  . hmmmm. the sad part is we are fortunate and our livelihood did not depend on us  following orders ! i lost my volunteer work that i lived for  7 yrs of disasters relief work for nearly every major distaste in the us  and it felt like losing a child . it took me around a year to deal with the grief and put it behind me. i know that sounds silly but it was my passion and my people! my heart truly breaks for those that lost their income along with their careers. we truly live in an upside down world .
@sandramae1772  isn t it just disgusting  my antennas went up years ago when going through an autism diagnosis for our youngest son. so many things started to just not add up. i stopped just trusting because they were the  experts   because they kept proving to me repeatedly that i was in fact the expert  in my son s case.  i ve learned so much since 2013  and god has seriously opened my eyes to what has been happening in our medical system. if i knew then what i know now....
@mariejasminedarling4138  i don t even do the initial puppy ones.  i have very healthy dogs who never have to go to the vet.
@martinmummert5614  . praise . god.   and . amen to what you just messaged. and.  god bless you always
@leslieiris7093  thank you for the kind words!  nowadays  folks like me don t receive too much support...only condemnation.
@leslieiris7093  and as you might guess  i m one of the few american males born in the 1960 s who survived the birthing process with intact genitals.
thank you maria - i live in australia   have a small dog who we rescued 2 years ago my dog had to have vet work done   since then i get never ending reminders of all sorts of vaccinations i refuse to vaccinate my dog   i do the heart worm and flea treatment   that s it ! can t believe that animals are being included in the vax money train too in the guise of protection by pushing fear - i am sure many dogs have had a shortened life because of over vaccinating
@juliehocking8145  many years ago  before i was wise to vaccines  i allowed my little chihuahua to be vaccinated.  he immediately began having seizures  and continued having them until he died.  i personally know several people who ve been severely damaged by vaccines.
@v.j.l.4073  amen!  avoid all pet vaccinations.  squirrels  rabbits  and kangaroos live just fine without them.  so dogs and cats can  too.
@mariejasminedarling4138  stand your ground. we went to a brand new vet for an initial checkup for our 14-year-old small dog because she needed her teeth cleaned. we have 3 dogs  2 cats  and keep them as holistic as possible with everything. when the tech came in he told us that she would need to be up-to-date on all shots vaccines prior to the cleaning  including getting another  unnecessary  rabies shot. we said  absolutely not.  she is an indoor senior pet who has absolutely zero interaction with pets other than her fur siblings in our home. she is battling dementia and we fought for the right to keep her brain and organs clean and functioning at optimal capacity  she gets a lot of therapeutic support in various forms.  needless to say  they respected our decision and cleaned her teeth anyway. and she is doing great. we do this with all our pets. you are in charge of their health  period. and never be afraid to ask for copies of blood test results and review them yourself.
@user-iz2nt1tr7r  thank you for your timely response- i have a vet appointment tomorrow morning for a teeth cleaning for my tiniest dog   have been worried about the vax pushing! i want to stand my ground. god bless you and i pray healing for your fur baby
@jesussaves-fw5bi  what did you do about tick medication and heart worm meds.
@mariejasminedarling4138  good luck and i will say a prayer for your strength and for your smallest furry one s teeth cleaning  and recovery  seems there are always a few teeth pulled!  i learned this with vets years ago. they don t know  everything  and they do not love your pet like you do. i had a dog who at age 14 became afflicted with acute pancreatitis  and with issues with his gall bladder and liver too. he had to have a very serious major emergency surgery. in the days after  he was dying from the meds they gave me and the vet hospital basically gave up on both of us  tellingme he had a 50 50 chance. we were totally on our own. in desperation  i crash coursed holistic remedies  herbal tinctures  and pet food in an effort to save him and immediately ditched the poison meds he had been given. long story short   he recovered   lived 4.5 more years and we never looked back to traditional  western meds  again. not once. not ever. not for anything. i learned sooo much over the last years of his life about pet health and nutrition.  many  most  vets are very similar to people doctors in their  education  and also their relationship to big pharma. and all those  recommended  foods sitting in their lobbies for sale...those are some of the worst quality foods that can be fed to a pet! seriously  the aafco is criminal in my opinion. just be adamant and firm that you do not consent to this or that shot vx  etc. and most importantly remain confident and do not act confused. you want to send the message that you fully understand your decision and that there will be no coercion. once they get the idea that you are neither naive or weak  fingers crossed they will respect your decisions. i hope the teeth cleaning went great!  what a wonderful dog mom you are . and lastly  two holistic companies for pets with which we have had fantastic results are azmira and pet wellbeing. both have completed extensive research on pet health  and both have passed my scrupulous eye
@mariejasminedarling4138  oh and god bless you too marie!
@dlandrews1  i inspect my pets for ticks  if they have them i remove them with a tick hook  or alternatively use diatomaceous earth   food grade   all over their coat  gets rid of fleas  ticks etc and can be used internally for any worms   parasites  even heart worm.
your last sentence is the purpose for bringing them in. long before modern dog food and the animal pharmacy  dogs lived just fine from table scraps whatever else and were not dying from cancers  tumors  diabetes  etc. what s the connection here !
i actually live in vancouver washington in the pnw also. i do things naturopathically also. god bless you and my hats off to your courage.
@mariejasminedarling4138  no wonder dogs are dying at 4 and 5 mostly with cancer
as you have medical experience  i have a hypothetical question  if you care to respond. let s say you have a relative with a solid aneurysmal bone cyst in the tibia that is approx 4x2.5 cm. the option your relative is given is surgery and bone cement. where would you direct them to search out their best options  and to research if the option given truly is in their best interest
@gdhhayes2129  i take a few approaches when faced with situations such as yours . first i ask the doctor who will be performing the surgery for extensive information on the actual procedure. i ask how many he she has performed. i would also research other practitioners in the department- what is their background and philosophy. i would interview at least 2-3 additional doctors. you can also research other hospitals but make sure the insurance is accepted.then you talk together as a family and pray  as is your practice . then make a decision based on your findings and informed decision. feel free to go back to any of these doctors with additional questions. i hope this helps  i also talk to other nurses  they know the doctors very well  and folks who have undergone the same experience if at all possible.i pray your loved one has a positive outcome.
and you should change doctors asap
@kimberlybrown4912  or you can google alternative conservative treatments like i did with my mother and my dog. and both are fine now without radical intervention from doctors who are happy to operate because that generates more money.
@redrumax  i see a holistic pa and my medical doctor. he s for if there s an emergency. she is my go-to person and i have been her patient and friend for many years.
@kimberlybrown4912  good.
just curious  what did the doctor say in response to your question about mrna in the pneumo vax  yes or no or did he refuse to answer
@monicak100  he didn t respond directly. he proceeded to tell me that he has access to better research resources than i do .  never inquired as to what my research sources were  peer reviewed studies by the way . i have learned to simply step over the toddler throwing the tantrum at this stage.
when any healthcare person thinks they know more than you about what is best for you  they  in actuality  have a dictator or god complex. either one is very dangerous and assures that they are not acting in your best interest. find yourself a new one who gives you advice on your options for care. there are always many options to care for any problem you have. i am a healthcare worker with 42 years of experience. you know what is best for you!
@darlenephillips5717  the practitioner i actually wanted wasn t taking new patients. i will be following up to see if she is in the near future. this is my second time seeing this particular doctor. i always believe in giving people time to show their true colors. he has shown himself to be who he is so i will move forward with finding a new doctor. i m not intimidated by him and will not cow-tow to his ideology. i appreciate your perspective.
@racegts  as with a job - look for a new one and obtain an offer before leaving the one you have . so it is with finding a new doctor. he is certainly on the way out  i can assure you.
wow  i don t know if this makes me feel better that even a nurse  who has waaaay more medical experience  training and education  ends up in a disappointing discussion like this with a doctor or if i feel more depressed and hopeless.
never hesitate to let a quack know he or she works for you at your discretion. i have fired 2 and it was sheer pleasure. haven t been to any  aside from dentists and optometrist  in 17 years.
@kimberlybrown4912  in other words  his ego would not allow him to confess that he had no idea.
disheartening...unfortunately this asymmetrical authoritarian turnkey tyranny will occur throughout every facet of our social alienated society.
@kates3308  it can be discouraging  but in all honesty i find it to be a good thing. they play their hands for all to see. it s better to know who what you re dealing with. finding an excellent health practitioner is akin to mining for gold. keep listening to discussions  talking to others and doing your research. and as pn said  arm yourself with knowledge and trust your intuition.
@micksheeto9438  nothing would surprise me . i started declining the flu vaccine several years ago at work. i m a remote worker and not around people super often. i also know what to do to build up and protect my immune system. based on those things i don t see a need to get them. we seem to have forgotten  people do get sick and our bodies know how to heal themselves  in most cases  with rest and natural remedies.
@nathanielovaughn2145  likely. i spoke to my friend who is a holistic pa. she directed me to dr tenpenny s website. i m putting this here for other s benefit in the future. my initial search didn t turn up that specific information. it listed some other concerning ingredients but not mrna. i will opt for keeping my immune system strong and healthy. i endeavor to stay active and eat right. this has kept me healthy for a long time
@debihester7284  true. sad  but true. it s like they don t even want to know.
that is terrible and you re a colleague!!
i can relate totally!im here in tn. as well  my dr of 30 years retired and what a nightmare trying to find a new one ongoing almost a year. i was treated horribly by a nurse practitioner in same group and told her i did not like way she spoke to me at2nd visit i was given a return apptand order for x ray 3days later a certified letter throwing me out of the whole group was delivered! been with them 30years and her boss didnt have decency to ask me what happened after i put at least one of their kids thru college!. it is outrageous. 2nd dr different group  told me not to b  ch about my test results not being at his office return visit for results appt  and take responsibility for myself and go get results from hospital and if i brought them back he would be glad to read them to me and tell me what they mean! at the checkout desk i relayed dr wanted me back 6months and clerk said are you really going to make appt  i stated it was possible i had been spoiled by previous dr but i said outloud cant believe i gotta pay for this! im praying i can find a real dr and friend not a business person holding a medical license.
my daughter had her pediatrician her son s pediatrician rather dismiss her because she did not vaccinate. toaster out of the office she didn t want to see him anyway he was with a group of other doctors she was seeing one doctor in particular but when you see a group you are instructed you must see everybody at least once and this guy was an ass. she packed up her things left and found a new doctor who went along with her holistic way of living.
@kccat5 good for her!
never be afraid to put a doctor in his place. my doctor wanted to prescribe statins for me because my cholesterol was just a little bit too high it wasn t abhorrently high it was just slightly over the line. when the nurse called me and told me this i said absolutely not and i ll be speaking my doctor again when i see her which i did. and i told her she is a d.o. and i chose her as my doctor because they are less inclined to prescribe and more inclined to do things on a more holistic nature you know let s fix it before we have to medicate it. somewhere between a naturopath and a regular md. i told her under absolutely no circumstances will i ever put a statin in my body and they are toxic and she just nodded with me in agreement and she said okay and that was the end of that. i have to add however when i first started seeing her i informed her that i drive the appointments that i have no trust in the medical community and that she s going to have to build a rapport with me and earn my trust and subsequently respect on my terms which she does and i love her to death for that she doesn t push anything on me anymore we discuss it and if i say no she s like okay. she did not even suggest the covid vaccine when i seen her . that s the way i want it and that s the way it is.
@kccat5  you have found a gem!
precisely why i walked awayfrom a 25 year rn career.
what is the best way to actually find a good functional  holistic medical practitioner    i d love to go that route rather than only relying on strictly allopathic providers.
@sandramae1772  working on it . trying to hang in a little longer.
i went to see a nurse practitioner several yrs back because i was having some scary dizzy spells. had already eliminated my eye s as the issue.  at this visit  he was cool abt alternative treatment to his diagnosis of needing birth control to help  my thought was it was a bone in my neck   fast fwd to 3 yrs ago  i went in for a diagnosis of bell s palsy  for my family s piece of mind  i knew what it was   but discovered that i had a fatty liver   really high bp  i already knew abt the bp . i told him i wanted an alternative to the bp meds  because of how they have affected my folks   i m always outside  so being allergic to the sun   taking something that also increases my chances of cancer. which considering my folks have skin cancer  2 uncle s died from cancer  1 in his lungs  1 it went from lungs to brain  i just didn t want to roll that dice. he was not at all happy that after 2 visits i was refusing to agree to the drug s   he said if i didn t want his help  that i could find someone else  because i would be putting his practice at risk   went on a guilt trip. i started taking a multi botanical supplement   it was dropping my bp   it wasn t fast enough  so he wanted to add another prescription.  he was happy that i agreed to the 1st prescription  never took it   so he knew i d argue abt another prescription   but i asked to give the 1st one a chance   added another herbal blend specially for blood pressure   it was down  but he thought it needed to drop more  but with the 2nd prescription i d be in the maintenance level. my kid s are not happy with me not telling him i was using herbs  but i reminded them i did in the beginning. i don t like dr s or close to being 1 who refuses to listen to their patients.  i ve had dr s who thought they knew more abt being a pregnant mom than the mom  or knew more abt my body then i would. and i ve had nurse s that were crap too. and when you have a baby in the nicu   have nurse s that act like doing their job was either too much to deal with or that we needed to bow down to their knowledge   be grateful that they re taking time out of their day to deal with your kid or you. i ve had some great nurse s during that time too. they re not always treated well by patients or dr s
i refused tests when nothing is wrong...when it s my time  it s my time.
@montanagal6958  i allow for annual bloodwork but everything else is only as necessary. too many unnecessary tests are ordered these days. but i surmise many are based on cya as healthcare workers are threatened with lawsuits daily. i can t help but wonder if people think about that - do you work and get threatened daily  other than teachers and law enforcement  who else operates with such a response
@flboyle2009  i got that one...i had no ill effects at all. i had an allergic reaction to the 2nd jab 3 weeks after i got it. i got the first shingles shot and was sick for over a week with flu like symptoms. i was warned to watch out for it.
@kimberlybrown4912  on the other hand if certain ingredients are below a certain percentage  they do not have to be listed. clever  clever therefore i tell them to get  you get the gist.
@kimedmonson3134  they practitioners with a license to kill in my opinion.
@willkaren4ver  that s dangerous   not about your health!
just walk away.
wow that dr is a disaster!! run from him!!
@kimberly as a neo peds respiratory  we have the ability to research. lol  wow  i m better than you are. still working and kids are very sick this season. it s  crazy.
@speakrighttogod  i have
@elizabethbarronn6696  i walked. he s a young pup with much to learn.
@msjulsfl  yes  lots of sick people right now. i work in mental health . it s unbelievable how broken people are.
the nerve of that pediatrician!  sounds like josef mengele trying to mangle others because he is  god n knows better.
you did the right thing there well done.
you are a good father  never apologize for protecting your son  your doing the right thing!
in the process of looking for a new doctor. if i get asked one more time why i m not vaccinated my heads going to explode. my father and brother  who have always been healthy had heart issues for about 8 months.
i asked my doctor about the covid vaccine and he said it has been well tolerated so i asked him what about the 750 young athletes in the us that died suddenly. he responded by saying he did not hear that so i told him to do the research. also i m finding a new doctor.
good for you! i m so grateful to see there are parents out there who feel like me. all of my children s friends and people we know received the  treatment    it s been very hard because the school is still pushing this but i will not yield.
good job dad! as a young mother  about 20 years ago   i had an urgent care doctor get very upset with me for refusing a tetanus shot for my young son after he cut his finger on a can of mandarin oranges and needed a few stitches.she disdainfully questioned if i even  knew what tetanus is and i answered and explained to her what it is and that i didn t believe that there was a risk of exposure or any horse manure on the mandarin orange can in my kitchen. she disappeared and left us sitting there for about 30 minutes and i suspect that she was trying to see if she could somehow force it. when she came back she asked if i even wanted him to have stitches. i said of course i want him to receive all the necessary care he needs.
tell them.  just a doctor.  have no fear.
right on!  they re not the ones who have to live with the consequences of their  recommendations   we are. and we need to remember that always!
my 78 yr old husband has been put thru the mill at our local hospital clinic. he had heart failure 4 years ago with a slight stroke. i am telling you here and now if he was still going to his dr on his own   he worked there for 20 years my husband did    if he did go to his appts on his own instead now with his walker and i am with him every time  he would have been coerced into this toxin. his dr last visit asked if he had the jab  we both said at the same time no he then replied to my husband   good luck with that   what the hay does he know that we don t            his previous dr was treating him for shingles nerve pain in his left shoulder. my husband would sit up at night and rock back and forth from the pain. a week later he was rushed to the er and the dr there came up to me right away  she told me my husband was in heart failure  its then i told her how his dr kept treating his shoulder arm pain as shingles. hubby is doing as well as one can expect  but i want every one to understand the agenda against us. this hospital and the the other  one in this city  have been doing massive expanding since the fall of 2020our hospital  is building an entire new hospital where the large parking lot used to be. they bought ambulances  never had them before  hired a crew to drive them and built a new building just for this.   the other hospital  who use their ambulances for our hospitals needs    we had a street closed and i had to drive past there one late afternoon. normally never go that way. i was shocked at the building going on there. they even added a hotel for family and visitors to stay in  its right on the main 5 lane highway  in front of this hospital. they also added many other small buildings  expanding their foot print.  where do you think  the funds money for all this in one year  of the cv  came from    let that sink in.
we had a similar situation last year. our pediatrician that we have loved for years offered the covid shot  and we declined. she then told my then 13 year old son that it was important he get his meningitis shot as well as a booster of two others. i politely told her we wouldn t be doing any injections today  and we d discuss it at home. she then turned to my son and told him directly  ok  well buddy...i understand that you didn t anticipate getting any shots today  but just know that at your next visit it won t be an option. it will barely be a pinch  i promise.   uhhhhhhh excuse me ! ! we left and never went back. i have moved our family to a naturopath. trust your gut parents!! you re not wrong
unfortunately most doctors are told by the medical establishment what is right  without doing their due diligence and common sense. they have to tow the line becz if they don t  they will lose their jobs
we had two amazing pediatricians. unfortunately  they both left for better pastures. the replacement doctor was a total corporate bully. she made a statement that if we don t keep up with the childhood jabs schedule  we can not be seen in her office.  we wished her fair well and left!!! my kiddos are in perfect health. if they need any medical intervention  we have a wonderful urgen care clinic we now go to.
my wife had heart   problems  and fainting blackout after her second jab late autumn  21 .  cardiologists won t say it was myocarditis or pericarditis but she never had heart issues prior to the jabs.  taken over a year but slowly getting back to normal.   we were both jabbed but agreed neither of us will be jabbed again.  we were lied to by our government and big pharma.  i was just in for my semi-annual paper visit  the nurse asked me if i wanted coof booster  flu  pneumonia  shingles ect....i said nope.  my pcp didn t say a word.
athlete or not  just don t get the jab  get healthy instead.
god bless you for saving your son s life!
@kimberly-yk1qs  stand up for your child as this is a death sentence if you don t!  god bless you.
@lennyanders1639  you should send him the documentary  died suddenly  on rumble.
@pnwfamily549  thank god you never went back! the nerve!!
good dad! keep up that mentality and your son will learn to question before blindly doing whatever those in authority  tell  you to do.
there are a lot of dr.s out there that swallowed the hype   i m gonna remain sceptical .
amen! you made the right choice!
it s a cult.
perfect wisdom!!!!
good call dad. i m a nurse and did not take it either but my dr. was against it too. he flat said he felt down the road it would be bad news  he wrote me a medical exemption which my employer accepted.
@teribennett5619  very sound advice indeed!
@robertarena6731  the correct response to the question about why you re not  vaccinated  is  because i m not an idiot.
good on you for standing up for your child!
@light weight  i had an allergic reaction to the 2nd jab. i developed a rash that has taken 2 years to improve. i still get flare ups.  my neurologist s nurse practioner told me i needed to get the boosters. i said no. i am not taking anymore since i developed this rash. she said well you need to anyways for the greater good and just learn to live with the side effects. i went off on her. i told her i don t sacrifice my health for anyone. i have enough to deal with. she never mentioned it again.
@lennyanders1639  whoa!!  way to go!!
great info
dang
me military medical man in the 70s your so right.
da noive!
try if and lowering ur carbs-any carbs  eat less of thema 6 hr eating window can change ur life when combined with lower carbs. as another old lady  i had to go to omad as well as keto. u may not have to be so strict
good for you! she was not just nursing for comfort btw - new research shows milk at that age basically turns back to colostrum! so amazing. so that was extremely helpful for her  the healthiest substance in the world     many of us are bringing the old ways of self led weaning back  most babies naturally self wean between  3-7 years . good on you mama for standing your ground! xo
your toddler was smarter than the doctor
in 1971 i nursed my son till he was two and a half. he had teeth and said milk was hot. so i stopped. he never had his tonsils out. he drank raw cows milk back then. he grew up and i never saw him with a cold or flu. sadly  he died at age 49 from drugs. i am all alone now at age 74.
i am saddened to hear your opinion about  many nurses today   especially from a retired nurse.
btw  i am a working rn.
@suegarner4428    so you know  right. isn t having some kind of npd or pathology a requirement these days  my sisters are narcs and nurses and bullies.
let me just say  as an rn of 34 years and an army medic nurses aid for 9 years before that  i am ashamed of the medical and nursing professions.  ashamed of what it has become.  astonished at how many people are just dialing it in... not doing their professional best. and yet  because of that  amongst other things  i discovered in myself this past week  that i m not going the full distance as i used to!  and only discovered that because i am actually orienting a new employee.  i found myself thinking... sheeze  i used to do such and such  why am i not doing that now   it was a shocker.  i know i am so beleaguered and discouraged. patients and families are not listening anymore... i m trying to give them a fair and balanced option and suggesting they choose a different health path.  you know  quit smoking  quit drinking  exercise  maybe stop using the statin drugs  participate in your spouse s attempts to maintain the house apt  all the health and wellness stuff.  it s either falling on deaf ears or outright derided.  i can t really blame them.  why listen to a profession that just wants to push an experimental vaccine on you and that is still wearing masks and face shields in their presence. i don t just come out and slam them  i use motivational interviewing  and a variety of other techniques to engage them.  i either run into one end of the political spectrum or the other.  i might as well shut up.  dial it in.  i m spending so much more time and energy for what   so that process all happened unconsciously. i just came aware of this  this past week.  i won t say i m having an existential crisis  but maybe i am.  i have 4 years  6 months and 15 days until i can hang up my stethoscope. i guess that sentence says it all. no  most nurses today don t have the bravery  brains or intuition.  nobody actually listens to patients anymore.  my own doc doesn t listen to me. i had to get a doc in a box to give me an abx for whatever sinus conjunctivitis crap was going around.  it of course turned into bronchitis  as it always does for me and after several violent coughing spasms  i partially avulsed an intercostal muscle. thank god i have an orientee to do the actually care last week and this week.  because if i had to get on the ground to wrap someone s legs or bend over to put in a foley i wouldn t make it.  i actually did have to one day wrap someone s legs and it set me back. or i see wound clinic s run by people who have no frickin  clue what they are doing and yet  won t listen to suggestions despite telling them i m wound certified and while there are a variety of different methods to take  in my experience  this particular regimen might reduce healing time. nope  they double down.  i dunno. maybe it s me.  maybe i m an a  . sorry to ramble so.  i don t talk to anyone about this because no wants to listen.  and i don t want to say it out loud anymore.  glad to hear someone was looking out for your husband.  thank god.
my mother went to her primary physician with shortness of breath while waiting for the doctor to return about 45 minutes his nurse was taken care of my mom and she said i m not allowed to diagnose you but it sounds like you have pneumonia you really should go to the hospital to which my mother did she went to the hospital that my doctor was affiliated with and they said she was just suffering from asthma gave her the option of going home or being admitted she said well if it s just the asthma give me more inhalers and i ll go home which she did turned out she had pneumonia the nurse was right all along but by this time she had been home a couple of days and we had to rush her to the hospital again and we brought her to the hospital that was closest to my home where they subsequently killed her. i trust no medical facilities anymore it was a nightmare while she was in there i had to fight with doctors fight with nurses long story and i m not going to get into it here because it s too painful but i no longer have trust for the medical system they have failed us over and over and over too many times
@kccat5  can t blame you one iota for distrusting the profession. at this point  no one should enter into a medical situation without an advocate. our civilization is devolving at a rapid pace. far  far faster than the romans or greeks. we wont even linger like the brits. i best not go any further along this thought lest i get banned. please accept my sincere condolences on your mother s untimely death. i wish i could help or could have helped in some way. best of luck to you and your family.
@edie4321  i m not sure what you mean edie. i do not work in a hospital setting so i can t speak to that.  the state of nursing sounds like the state of teaching.  bad!
@suegarner4428    sorry  i was under the impression that you worked in the field with many other nurses.
@suegarner4428  bless you!
@motherearthpam  hang in there! or take a step down    job in a more healthy environment. that would wear me down.  i think challenging ppl to do something different is perceived as an insult and hubris and pride prevent them from humbly saying  you have more experience  i think you are probably right. will you help me do this     hubris vs humility. it s been conditioned into most ppl.  that aspect of humanity scares me more than anything  except for perhaps how they would respond to others if the lights had been out for a while and ppl were hungry. all bets off then.
@weekendatbernies2265  you might have something there.
@suegarner4428  unfortunately it s true  and many younger newer nurses flat out left the profession as they ve been so aghast at the practices.
@suegarner4428  a good number of older very skilled rns absolutely agree with her.   it is a good thing to be truthful about this -
part of the problem is that nursing education is not as rigorous as it used to be.  the state boards now reflect that.  i know professionals who have worked with state board of nursing in my state.   they say the boards are much easier and no honest examiner could never deny it.
@kccat5 thanks for sharing. i m not a nurse  but a health care professional. i m shocked to hear about your mother. may i ask  how did the hospital kill her  pneumonia can be difficult to fight off as we age. so sorry to hear you lost your mother. mine died at 57 from als. dr. s couldn t help her.
@motherearthpam thanks for sharing. my mother was what i refer to as an  old-school  nurse. she actually really cared for people. she was responsible. i m not so sure about the standard of care these days. i really think preventative medicine is best through a healthy diet and lifestyle.
@charlotte vale  the old way back when i was young  lol  also weeded out those who simply would not suit the profession. a relative of mine loved her job but was impulsive and would work with earphone in. these things would hve been dealt with in the old school and she would have made  great nurse. she was caring  intuitive  quick on her feet and very knowledgeable.  sadly she cannot find her nch again.
it is amazing that he admitted that to you!    good on you for following your god-given intuition!
so glad you didn t take it
when my daughter became my care taker  the company my ins recommended  wanted her to have the vax. i told them with all the bad news on tv lately  no. she had been an remote employee for county  when the mandates deadline drew near  she left her job as a vax tracer. she had heard and seen a lot of bs from cdc. gov was not here at all for the people. it saw us as lab rats. sorry for those who are dealing with the side effects of the jab. i accidentally found out while hospitalized that i would not be required to take the jab cause of egg allergies. young tech blurted it out while taking my history. he got painfully jabbed in the ribs by his co worker. don t know if that was truthful but because of the other s reaction  i believe it to be so. too many elders in my family were blackmailed into taking the jab. couldn t see grandkids otherwise.
yes  nursing is an art. demanding job as well. i ve met some amazing ones  almost became one  caretaker instead  and ran myself into the ground. grateful you didn t.
exactly!
it s exactly what pediatricians do to parents.
amen!
@zhippidydoodah9190  you got that right  i remember specifically when i was a child when a dentist was shaming my mother for not allowing me to have fluoride treatment to my teeth. looking back now  i am so grateful that she didn t  my mother knew the harm of what they were trying to push.
prayers for all the vaccs d.
@scottmcmaster46  i pray that they would have some common sense and see the errors of their ways.
@isaac357mag  i wish it was that easy  ! mandatory   where they have others enforcing  the agenda   to suit the purpose  where holding a bleak future  if you fail to comply  is quite motivating !
@scottmcmaster46  i m glad the patriots that fought for this nations freedom in the american revolution didn t have that attitude  because i m sure living under  mandatory  british rule would have been a lot easier than fighting back for freedom.
@isaac357mag  totally agree with you   america is too soft !
exactly the same with the jab. when they are paying people to take it  that s a big nope.
you forgot   bribed .
@dothehokeypokeyandgetbusy6359
i haven t been seen since this all started.  it sounds like things have gotten bad in the medical community.  i know a few nurses who quit their profession.  i can t imagine being seen when there is an us vs them mentality.
bravo
@maryi4668
folks are waking finally. what happened monday in front of millions is opening eyes.
hey brother...had to come back here again. please watch  died suddenly  on u tube. will be taken down asap so it s on rumble too...gid bless and keep you isaac. prayers always. shalom. susun
exactly how i felt when they insisted and ganged up on me to do chemotherapy treatments! i said no to the anguish of the medical community and so far  god has brought me thru another 5 years.
@grammyshouse6708  glory to god.shalom.
@grammyshouse6708  hallelujah praise god
to be coerced into a medical procedure is actually against federal law.  stop being sheep. do your due diligence people. record these people as you sight federal law statutes and take them to court. if you can t find a lawyer  take legal action yourself.in my opinion   if you can  unplug from the medical industrial complex. seek out a more natural avenue
@charliepiston3169  let s get them started. finally someone says what i ve been saying. a little affirmation goes a long way. thank you.
i m so glad my hubby and i resisted the trillion dollar advertising  push pressure  put upon us and feistily avoided any .  we both have had the vid twice  and decided that god s immune system was working way better for us  than some random  unknown  untested shot was ever going to  so we did not take any of them  despite the consequences they threw  and continue to try to put  on us.
@bella-gj6wc  amen to that  i m so glad that many people are seeing through the lies and not taking that poison clot shot.
dentists do the same!
@halspals  i agree.
well said.
@rudrashakti108  667 now  and yes it probably is  or at least a mark of tyranny and mass extermination.
@rudrashakti108  this i know.
true! as an occupational therapist i couldn t do those things!
i quit having mammograms and useless pelvic exams 6 years ago. they try to find any anomaly to screen for cancers! i say no!
@lisaanderson4379  what happened on monday
amen
my mom  now has neurological problem   3 weeks  after getting a booster  ! not a happy camper.
in hospital right now  !
@scottmcmaster46  prayers for her and you.
@scottmcmaster46
@websurfer5772  thank you so much for the well wishes  ! god bless you .
@isaac357mag
one thing to keep in mind is that your religious rights are given by god and protected by the constitution  corporations do not have the power to grant or deny them!! it is up to you to decide  not who you work for!! i m just saying that a religious  exemption  is ridiculous! my boss  in a lengthy conversation about why i refused to even wear a mask  admitted that as far as religious legality is concerned  they can t even touch it!
i m retired from healthcare and rarely go to dr. unless it is to urgent care.  i rely on the great healer-jesus.  feel great. peace be with you.
i agree that avoiding the majority of health care is a good thing  but not getting mammograms   colonoscopies is a mistake! i am a medical assistant that had for a season worked in a gi clinic   so many patients that underwent colonoscopies really helped those folks prevent a real  agonizing way to die by having the doctor remove tiny polyps that were cancerous or had the potential to become so in the lower digestive tract. i really hope that you will reconsider your stance on this 2 very common preventive measures.
@amycopeland1701  i appreciate that but i put my trust more in yeshua than man s imperfect systems. ecclesiastes 3 1-2  1to everything there is a season  and a time for every purpose under heaven  2a time to be born and a time to die ...  i keep my eyes on him and faith that he will lead me through the trials ahead  including death by whatever means. nothing comes to us  good or  bad   but that he either causes or allies it for our ultimate good. at least that is how i experience life  and eventually death.
me too i have humana as my medicare advantage and i have the same issue with them constantly sending me reminders to get mammograms and colonoscopies and vaccines none of which i ever do because no thank you and i actually told him to stop calling and texting me stop sending me paper letters and if i need you i will call you and to this day the phone calls the text the emails they continue it s just getting so damn old.
i just took out humana..but i m ready for the battle when the emails texts and phone calls come.broke my arm in 2002. severe fracture. after surgery  sure enough in 3 months the insurance company had a case manager call  wanting to have a  home visit . uh huh... they see a petite 45 year old single woman alone with large dogs and horses and they d be in court trying to extract me off my farm into a nursing home.i told her to stay off my land  i would call the sheriff if she showed up. call the doctor to check on my progress...and leave me aline..i m not a compliant patient if something is off. i m the biggest problem child headache they ll deal with. bring it.
@kccat5  i live in florida  where i think they maybe back off a little easier because our governor is very pro freedom and definitely not into medical overlords in his state  especially relative to anything covid related. keep telling them - they will hopefully eventually get the message. they did try with me most recently to schedule a home health visit. i told them to stop stalking me on that one. they don t have my home address as everything goes to my ups box in town  so i don t have to worry about them  dropping in for a visit .
i went thru the hassle of changing my number because of the calls. just use the eye and dental coverage.
@amycopeland1701  so i take it you haven t seen the latest studies on the  value  of routine colonoscopies
same here. they were calling me daily and wanted to schedule me every 3 months even though i have no ongoing medical issues  don t take any prescriptions. i go in for my bloodwork every year and that s usually  it. i have a new provider and doctor now and if they bug me for nothing i will spam their phone number too. hope they are not all alike.
humana tried a similar tactic with my wife and i. they wanted to come out to the house for a  wellness visit . take blood pressure  etc. i had heard through the grapevine that they would be offering the clot shot at that time. no  no and no.
@hollywoodbob39  exactly why i don t want anything to do with them  unless absolutely necessary. when i went for my new doctor meet and greet appointment last year  the front desk person on my way out was so forcefully adamant that i call and schedule my lab work appointment as soon as possible  that i never did and have never gone back. a few months ago they called with that same  you must do this right now  tone of voice  which gets nowhere with me  except gone. i think they believe all older people have white coat worship fear syndrome or something. i know my own body better than they do.
@ts3063  my mom had several colonoscopies due to crohn s disease and 2 times they ruptured her colon.  the surgeries only made things worse.  just sayin .
@jolenebear7173  that s terrible. been through several colonoscopies  other patients  and luckily haven t yet seen a perforation. according to latest study  there is little questionable value in routine colonoscopies.
@ts3063  no  is that in with the studies on the value of covid vaccines and boosters  masks  lockdowns and social distancing  honestly  i don t follow any of that stuff.
@ellenlefavour628  no  actually. i work in healthcare. and we are on the same page here.
@ts3063  i m sorry ts  that comment was directed to amy but got sent to you by mistake. i know we are on the same page.
same here with kaiser healthcare.  god is our maker and healer.  peace be with you.
ellen lefavour bravo! i m a bible believing practicing messianic  christian on medicare. i was counseled to get a full physical in 2021. all the doctor did was bully me trying to get me to get vaccinated even to point of yelling at me that i will be the cause of my little grandkids deaths from giving them. civil. my grandkids celebrated their 7th and 16th birthdays this month and i m going to celebrate mine. that s how evil doctors have become. i reported him but nothing was done  since he didn t actually harm me  never mind that he traumatized me. i told my insurance don t call  text  nor email me. i m doing my own homeopathic treatments.
@soniag4516  halleluyah. yeshua hamashiach is the greatest healer. we are always best off putting our trust in him  in all areas of our lives  especially in these days.
yesssssssssssss!!!
i kept getting postcards from signet to get a wellness.  i went to a doctor s clinic where they said they take humana.  they didn t.  now billing says they say they take it because they can file for it.  now i have an outstanding bill for something that was totally free and covered if they had been in network as portrayed.  so deceptive of this clinic and on top of that they are using a billing service up in maine !!  i am in arkansas.
@soniag4516  i am also messianic.  it s all about the money with most.
i hope you got your money back.
good god  how awful.  you are much better off w o any of that lot.
@dontstepinthegrease  yes
they absolutely broke multiple federal and state. know your laws so you can educate others. you re right  it s humiliating and scary to be denied care. however  do you really trust those people you treat  i don t. not anymore.
pure blood here ! i won t date women whom have had the roll up your sleever .
pure blood here too and antonia  anyone i talk to about the medical field  including myself  feels the same way as you!  my dr is pretty good fortunately.  but i ve heard so many people complaining about drs now.  they ve ruined the medical field and now it s a disorganized meat market!!!
@floridagirl6690  that scares me hearing it from someone in my state.  i will try to stay healthy on my own.
@qua7771  agree!  that s what i do too ar!
@floridagirl6690  i didn t realize that it had gotten that bad.  i ll have to consult some of the nurses in my area for advice in case of future health issues.  thanks for the reply.
they are getting reimbursed for this crap!!
now days. we are not just our own nor our families best advocates but also to those in whom are incapable of being so for themselves. we have god on our side and we have societal trust conditioning to work through when we consider our fellow human being needing our interventions.  to god be the glory..
@brad2548  exactly!!
@kneppwoodathome  aaaaaaand. disregard bob dillon s comments.  if god says have children at whatever age. you go right ahead. abraham and sarah are our examples to say  god keeps his promises and provides for his own. by the way i subscribed to y all. lolololo. god bless
@brad2548  thank you! i shouldn t rise to the bait  but some people are so irksome  lol  my bestie struggled with infertility and was finally blessed in her 40s  her husband is in his 50s. i m too old for toddler s again  i ve got grandkids i adore  and i m definitely advocating for them to have an actual future. blessings to you and yours
@kneppwoodathome  i don t think you are older than sarah and abraham were.just saying. be open to what god may want to bless you with. you now have the wisdom of life experience  an advantage as compared to the young. best wishes
@heidimisfeldt5685  thank you   blessings friend
@kneppwood at home   your comment renewed my faith and gave me some comfort as well. thank you
@michelleyb.9709  i m so glad! thank you!
amen!!!!
i used to work in ers doing crisis psychiatric assessments to determine proper level of care. i cannot count how many times i had to tell a doctor to please consider giving the patient some medicine for their high blood pressure. they would balk and say that really isn t important. i would warn them with blood pressure not with normal limits often inpatient psychiatric facilities would not take a patient. over and over patients would get denied for admission because medically the facility felt they were not medically cleared because their blood pressure was too high.i won t even discuss when utis were found and the doctor s unwillingness to treat those as well.very sad what our medical field has devolved to.
they re not doctors anymore - they are pharmaceutical representatives that got the right to write prescriptions.
@goinghome1191  it s good to get out of the system  only i haven t worked at all living in the boonies 50 miles out from the nearest town.  so  that has left me in an extremely bad position  running up my credit cards to live.  now  i don t even have anything left on them and no money to even pay the monthly payments. i m totally broke thanks to this bogus c thing.
high bp is rarely about genetics but highly associated with insulin resistance.  look into low carb keto  better yet zero carb carnivore.  i have literally seen results bordering on miraculous.  i m carnivore 4 years  low carb for years prior   now 64 yrs old and have healed a mess of disorders.  i take no pharma  i ve not seen an md in years.  stay strong!!
@trid2bnrml149  pill pushers indeed  and now gummy pushers for kids and the elderly.  awful.  i ve become my own doctor and doing just fine.
hmmmm...think they might have wanted that big c diagnosis first...before you stroked out.  better reimbursement rate.  so sad.
@beach bumt1  good thing you didn t take their mark. this is a spiritual battle as well as a physical one for the souls of men.
i had 3 mini strokes with those headaches. woke me up at night. lasted about 20 minutes but during that time  i literally thought i was fixing to die. i prayed for the lord to take me into his living arms! i m not exaggerating a bit! way worse than a migraine.
@muchasalud2011  that s how i brought mine down. along with glucose and 50 lbs!
thank you so much patriot nurse. i m a retired respiratory therapist and have shared your video now with many of my friends and family in an attempt to warn them about what s actually happening inside our medical community. it s no longer healthcare  it s generally sick care. i praise god everyday i m no longer working in that field that i loved so dearly. be wise everyone and discerning.
never ...ever.... go to a hospital without an advocate...   ever...
i am an rn recovering at home from a total knee.  felt like i was dying after discharge and indeed i was.  turns out  was infected with mrsa during surgery.  looking at antibiotics for the rest of my life  two more surgeries  or as i pray  healing from god  in whom i put my trust.  listen to pn  she knows what she is speaking about!  if i had not listened to my intuition  i would have died at home after discharge.
at 70 years old  and having been married to a doctor for 12 years  i learned early on that the best doctors listen to their nurses! i have received better care from rns and pas than i have many doctors. best doctor i ever had  after listening to my symptoms  turned to his nurse and asked for her opinion of my diagnosis. she was correct. he earned my respect that day. please remember that physicians are your employee  and you have the right to question them  and you should!
boy  you gave me flashbacks to a doctor who fired my husband as a patient because he would not go headlong into the sleep apnea  alien on your face  garbage without reservation. the guy was adamant he do it  my husband refused  didn t need it . i fired that same doctor  we were forced to use him for awhile due to shrinking medical insurance coverage availabilty for retired military  long story  when we had a vax argument-he pushed all vaccines  did not believe in the immune system and when i said  just to get him off my back  that i would research the shingles vax and get back to him  he called me pigheaded. such a god complex! my next doctor was a fabulous woman-smart  savvy  willing to listen to me  etc-but she died suddenly and mysteriously a couple of years ago and left me searching all over again. i think the main issue is that they are all part of corporations now  not really independent physicians  and they just follow their programming and the company rules. i m not a patient they want because i am never sick  i m 66 . i go in once a year to have my thyroid retested to see if the synthroid is still the right dose  but that is all. now  it s the last place i want to show my face. i did break my leg when tree went rogue and hit me during a cutting accident year ago  but even staying in the hospital for surgery for three days  in and out for follow-ups  i never once wore a mask and i never will. i never get jabs  never had a flu shot  so why would i change what works to keep me healthy by taking experimental drugs just to make someone else feel better  this last few years have killed any faith i ever had in the medical community  pn. good thing i rarely ever need it  i guess. always love your frank talks  thank you.  cynthia  n. ga mountains
when my son was in second grade  he was impulsive. the principal wanted me to talk to my pediatrician about putting him on  medication  . mind you  he had just had a full spectrum of  educational and social   testing that showed his vocabulary was on a 5 th grade level and his iq was 132. his teacher was just out of college and he was a handful. i said no to the medication.
you are so right about the arrogance. i am an easy-going woman  and when i mention to a doctor about my own research or mention alternative healing methods such as herbs  i usually get these reactions  totally dismissive  don t listen to me at all  and even anger. this has happened my entire life  and even includes dentists and eye doctors. it s really hard to find a truly good medical practitioner who isn t on an ego trip  or being paid under the table by big pharma.
i had to use that tactic for the hpv shot for my sons.  they pushed that one hard at the pediatricians office.  even telling me it prevented cancer!  i just told them i would think about it  and she would give me the pamphlets.  i would go home and throw that crap away.  they never got that shot along with the clot shot.  when my 17 year old had to have the meningitis shot  i made the nurse bring that vial in the room and draw it up so i knew they weren t swapping it for the clot shot.
i absolutely agree with you. as a survivor of the public education system  you hit nerve when you mentioned  hyper-active . i  and earlier  my parents  were repeatedly told that i was add and later on when it became the  thing   adhd. i wasn t  i was just bored out of my tree. with no major educational direction and doing only what i needed to get a c  i tested in my 30 s with an iq of 146. i  am  disgusted with the whole system and what destruction they have done and continue to do to our youth.i haven t been vaccinated since the year 1999. the level of toxins  neurotoxins  carcinogens and or suspected carcinogens in vaccines is disgusting. i can t even say legally how i feel about those people running the system.tell me  which is more expensive for an insurance system  treating a person with a round or three of chemotherapy or  treating the person with medication to raise their blood ph to between 7.4 - 7.45 and maintain it there with periodic blood tests all while giving the person an oxygen bottle and let them increase their oxygen intake  again with periodic monitoring only one will actually kill the cancer while making you healthier. the other will poison you  killing your immune system in order to  kill the cancer  as well. thus making you more susceptible to really get sick and or dying from something else since your immune system is dead. smh god bless you for fighting the fight...peace!

hey girl  rrt neo peds! still working 61.
@skywaternc.hope i got your name right my eyes are not what they use to be.yes never   i repeat never go to hospital without someone else with you whom can speak on your behalf! you mam are so correct! i learned the hard way! as a aged person they will   well i can t say on here. l
i had a bad pap   the only bad one i ve ever had and i m almost 50  when i was 19 after our insurance changed and we had to go to kaiser. they said i had hpv and wanted to do a procedure to remove part of my cervix. they kept saying cancer cancer cancer and scared me to death. my mom took me for a consult with my old school obgyn  he said absolutely not! he said they should have done a second pap to be sure it wasn t false positive which they did not. i had a biopsy though but didn t do the main procedure and the doctor got really mad at me. i did get a pap three months later and it was perfectly fine and has been ever since. i am convinced they lied and wanted to perform an unnecessary procedure on my and possibly make me sterile. my gut said no and i listed to it. don t be rushed into things  most things aren t that pressing that you must do it immediately!
i was red-pilled about government fingers in medicine by a doctor in the family in the 70s.  the food pyramid and high fructose corn syrup were two of the soap boxes he got on. in the 80s no one needed  managed care  by the insurance racket but that s what we got.before managed care happened things were different.  insurance was cheap   6 bucks a month  and used for catastrophic events.  doctor s visits  happened when you got sick and an office visit was between 20 and 40 dollars.  our pediatrician would come to the house if everybody was sick.   chicken pox  this kept the crud out of his office.mom negotiated dad s back surgery because they were able to pay cash without involving any insurance critters and was pretty proud of getting the cost down by almost half.  then government got involved.. regulators happened.. agencies were born  insurance became a monolith and all of a sudden there were a crap load of unnecessary employees to be paid.. so prices went up.i was assigned a female gyn that tried to put me on anti-depressants for menopausal hotflashes.  i only saw her once.a different doctor tried to put me on celebrex - the same year the class action was announced.  prescribing something that s on the court docket.. bad form and borderline malpractice... and this fella was an active duty col.he really didn t like that i was aware of all that.
at the beginning of my rn career a very wise gp once told me to always listen to the parent because they know their kid better than anyone. i followed that advise for 35 years and always found that approach in the er to be very helpful even to the point of helping a doc not make a mistake. this advise works!!sincerely the old northwoods rn
i am very fortunate in having a primary care who shares my values  believes in me  and most of all listens and hears.  he knows that i trust my gut and even if he doesn t agree completely  he still supports me and my decisions.   amazing man.  i ve referred my friends to him over the years and he literally  very literally  saved a friend s life by listening to her  doing testing  and discovering a tumor that all her other doctors had missed because they wouldn t listen to her.  he is worth his weight in gold many times over.
70 year old canadian who has been subscribed to your blog for years  and donated too. pn  you are a beautiful human being in every way!!! god bless you!!!  from a non-conformist  educated  critical thinking  un-jabbed  unmasked  well liked by few  and despised by many  who feels like i am living in a world resembling a1930 s-1940 s german european dystopian world. the pot of water  starting as tepid since mar 2020  has been heating up slowly  and the ignorance of this fact is rampant!
have you looked at ozone or colloidal silver to augment or replace the antibiotics   antibiotics forever means no gut flora forever too.
infections after knee surgery are  unfortunately  quite common. i had to fight to even get them to consider the possibility. i had 3 different infections.

praying for your healing gala
i m retired cna  please look into ways to  de-colonize  mrsa.  one of my doctors  after repeated abscesses from mrsa  recommended swimming a few times a week  or putting some bleach in the bathwater  i have well water  as well as muripocin ointment just inside the nares.  my last check for mrsa was negative and luckily it s been a few years since my last abscess.
oh man  as a fellow rn  my heart breaks for you.  wishing you godspeed in your recovery.

look into mushrooms.  not a joke.
and fire them.
you hit the nail right on the head my friend    i m a man in my 60s.  i learned a lot from my aunt   the herbs in the woods  natural cures.  never took any over the counter medication till in her 90s.   died in the hospital after receiving expert   medical care. keep  up the good advice.    if people will only listen!!!
patriot nurse  sometimes my anger rises to a degree i feel sick. i cannot  stand those who are seeking to forcibly make our decisions for us.
try colloidal silver as it cured two people that started using it according to them.
coming from another entire adult life healthcare provider your assessment is absolutely spot on
every sick person needs an advocate i wish there was a network of good rn nurses that would start a service like this  if i had not been there for my son who was hit by a train and had a severe brain hemorrhage and was due to go to rehab  in two days and they hadn t even done a scan to see how the brain hemorrhage was doing  he kept telling me he felt like he was going to die and wasn t getting the right meds to shrink the clot when i came to the hospital there was a team of nurses and a doctor trying to convince me he was ready for rehab and that he was exaggerating his problem i went to his room and he was almost delusional couldn t put sentences together and was looking awful so i decided to take him out of this hospital and the staff basically ganged up on me  they said you can t do that  i said watch me  we disconnected all his tubes and i and my friend practically had to carry this 6 2 out of the hospital because they refused us a wheel chair i drove over a hundred miles to a hospital near where i live  a good one  once at that hospital emergency room they tried to deny him because the other hospital called and said we were trouble makers and that we broke the rules and walked out by this time my son was becoming incoherent and passing out  a brain surgeon was walking through e.r and over heard me arguing with this doctor about kicking us out  he walked into the cubicle took one look at my son and ordered a scan long story short he had a hematoma the size of a grapefruit and it had shoved his brain into the other hemisphere total brain shear emergency 10 hour surgery and half his skull removed  doctor said the surgery was a success but only time would tell if he ever walked or talked again it s been a long long journey from amnesia and other injuries i tell you all this because if i had not done what i did my son would be dead  i was and advocate for my husband many times  learn to trust your gut and learn about some medical problems so you are ready to help blessings to all
the pushing of jabs and the attacks by health care professionals  family members  and the public against those who refuse has been going on for at least the last 28 years that i personally know of.  i wasn t aware of it until i began having children. after a bad reaction to jabs in my oldest son  at about 2 years old   i  began researching and decided not to give him anymore. our younger three have never had any.  they are all very healthy and  with more knowledge of natural at home care and supplements  we ve been able to treat nearly all illnesses without assistance from doctors. i have been fortunate to have some good doctors and other health care professionals who haven t been too pushy with what they think is best  but the  narcissist philanthropist savior attitude  is alive and well and growing. i have run into several of them over the years of being a mother.
i saw this during my decade in the military and even worse so  when using the va. i know what each visit will be like  what questions asked and answered expected. i know not to expect any help or care  at all. i ve had to do all that on my own and with doctors who are actually practicing medicine. all for cash which is very expensive. your words to god s ear  all true!
check out thyrogold.  so much better than synthroid.  had all the ts  not just a couple.  ndt is way better.  comes from bovine in new zealand and put into capsules in jupiter  fl.  kind of pricey-  i only use this for years and i also took myself off blood pressure medicine  beta blockers bad  and manage this with cinnamon and exercise and diet.  it did go off the charts when i had a concussion may 2021 and still have some elevation since then with headaches.  i received absolutely no treatment at the er even though my head was punctured and bleeding from a rusty stake in the ground.  it s only by yeshua s healing power i survived such an impact to my cerebellum.
@oyenations162  does it require a rx
@oyenations162  i ve been on levothyroxine for about 22 years so it s not the same as someone who has only been on that for a few. i m doing well and i ve read many testimonials about thyrogold  some bad  some good. since i m doing well  i m not sure i want to monkey with what is currently working as i have no other health issues  weight is normal and i am never ill.
@soonersciencenerd383  yep and my husband s solution for his snoring was to sleep with a window cracked near the bed for fresh air all night  even in winter. it worked. i truly believe many breathing issues are from breathing foul recirculated air. we live in the mountains  plenty of fresh  clean air  and i also crack a window for fresh air all night. it works wonders.
here in wv  it s that way also hardly any independent drs and the ones we do have are afraid of our state dea   if they write any tape of a controlled substance even the fda approved fibromyalgia drug lyrica they are afraid to write   now i ve been on 3 meds for 25 years as due to that type of craziness i m suffering because i m not getting this for my dr moved they are by no means heavy-duty drugs that get a person high or that drug addicts even want and one of them is considered an anti deprepresent but because it helps pain with some ppl they won t tell me i don t need it or it will hurt me they just say  the dea will come in on me if i write that   i said so what you have 25 years worth of medication and medical records but they would rather see you suffer or give meds that will hurt you worse than it helps
@amberdmcclure  it s not about the patient anymore  as you ve seen  but about profits and kow-towing to government pressure. we have to be our own advocates  eat nutrient-dense foods  get fresh air and sunshine and be active to take care of ourselves and avoid the need for medical intervention as much as possible. good luck to you  amber.
@rootsrocksfeathers1159  wow  what a simple solution.  certainly proves pn s point very well.  we can resolve a fair amount of our own problems if we have a little confidence in ourselves.  thanks.
@sl4983  no  not at all
@rootsrocksfeathers1159  you can bring your research to your doctor and see what they say.  from the testimonials i ve read most are good.  i think the blood analysis readings would tell the story if you do switch.  maybe your doctor would want to try a comparison alongside you however unlikely that might be.
@rootsrocksfeathers1159  well said.
agree 100
my son s pediatrician asked me to leave the room so he could talk to my son alone after i declined this vaccine. nope. we have not been back to that doctor since. crazy stuff.
@sj we had the same thing for my son. at 12 she pushed the hpv shot then again at 13. i was really surprised by the way she acted about it but prior to that we were very compliant. i did some research and i am sooooo glad he didn t get it!
@bethannsmith4969  unbelievable!!
@bethannsmith4969    what an incredible nerve!!!!   never  ever allow them to do that  nor bully you into anything!
@bethannsmith4969  are you kidding
@sl4983  the pediatrician had been with us since birth. i just said no maybe next time when he asked. it felt super creepy and made me very angry. that is not medical care it is medical domination.
@bethannsmith4969  until recently  i was an rn for 15 years - as a parent  do not ever leave the room. you cannot trust these people.
@katiejon17    when i was 15 my nurse mother took me to the doctors for a sore throat. for some reason  possibly the doctor asked her to  she waited in the waiting room while i was examined. the doctor insisted on giving me a breast exam and because of my upbringing  thought there must be a reason for it. my mother treated doctors as gods and allowed for my molestation. never go to or be examined by a doctor alone  ever. at age 16  another doctor wanted to give me a pap smear for a sore throat  i had wised up by then.
funny for me i ve asked for yrs for a vit b shot  nope. but now offered one. hard pass.
@debihester7284  i think that is the main goal  you are correct.
sj - i had the same experience with our family dr. a couple years ago when i took my son for his physical he was pushing the hpv shot for the first 10 minutes! i kept saying no and he just kept telling me things like  it s a miracle prevention for cancer  and  you re making a bad decision for your son  etc.. when we left the office my son told me how uncomfortable he felt. so when i got the  rate your visit  email  i wrote down how bad it went and what my son told me and that we decided to look for a different doctor. well  he called me and apologized. i told him that i was a pharmacist  who worked in regulatory affairs and he was wrong about the hpv shot. needless to say that we found another physician who never pushed any shots or drugs and although her office is further out i am happy to drive there. we love her  she s awesome!
i think most of the time hpv will go away by itself.
i experienced this at that age as well . questionable cells.  the doctor did a quick cauterization  it was painless   one and done. it was free.  university student health   back in that era women at my age had mothers who were given drugs  diethylsilbesterol  possibly spelled wrong here  that embeded into  fetal development   so there was an accurate correlation. that said i went on   to full force develop into a natural medicine advocate and teacher.
public fool system
you and the others i ve been reading just prove pn attracts followers with the highest intellect on the internet.
@oyenations162  thank you.. for me it s more subject specific.. i am no where near high on the math scale.  research is more my speed.
your doctor sounds wonderful! i would love to know his name if he happens to have his practice near where i live by some crazy chance. i am in texas near houston.
@kates3308  dr. catague   spelling   in cypress  tx  part of methodist. he listens  wrote medical exemptions for flu v   the other jab. he is very caring.
@magentared5822  ty...i will pass your recommendation along to others.  i live near cypress.  i do like my present dr.  who listens and considers my observations...he is on hwy 529 and barker cypress.  dr timothy tang.
@truthseeker9688    thank you  so great to know that there are options available. they just are a little challenging to find. take care   god bless you   your family!
there is!  america s frontline nurses!
blessings to you mama bear!
bless you.  you are a great mom.
you re amazing.

same. i wouldn t trust the va with any care. i have had such bad care with most doctors. only my chiropractors seem to care.
with cash you should be able to negotiate a little.  one place tried to charge me over  1100 bucks for an x-ray series on my ankle.. i called around  offered cash and we paid 95 dollars  out the door.  if the office doesn t have to dick around with the insurance people  services should be more reasonable.
thanks for the advice and medical updates! it has been received! sadly we ve experienced this here in rural n.c.  sophia . i ve heard numerous stories from friends of mine over the last 2 yrs. all related to the vaccine. 3 of them  guys  have 3 different doctors  all women  and were harassed over this and one was even told that he  we  the unvaccinated  were the reason that we still had the virus! i m almost 60 and my wife has been a nurse for 23  yrs. i m telling you things you already know though! keep up the   good   work and stay safe! jesus is lord!
when i was 5 years old  i lost my grandfather whom i was very close to  and my oldest brother who was my hero. i was his shadow and between those two men  i knew my world was right and safe. they both passed suddenly and unexpectedly due to heart attack and accident respectively. needless to say  i was confused  distraught and lost. but this lasted only 1 day. my mother  who was also 9 months pregnant  fearing for the safety and health of the unborn  took me to the doctor with her and told the doc what i was experiencing. so  he promptly prescribed me something in the sedative line. i have no idea what it was. a close friend of our family  who wanted to adopt me  during this time  was with mom and me while at the doc s office. in those days   1965  times were different  and she was allowed to be in the room with us. anyway  she told me about this sedation about 6 or 7 years ago. she needed to clear her conscience with me  she said. apparently  mother kept me on the sedatives for several years after those traumas. the family friend objected to the meds and spoke sternly to mom to not allow this. the friend wanted to adopt me before this all happened  and  ramped up her desires rapidly. this was due to other family dynamics that is not appropriate for open discussion. suffice to say  that when she would come pick me to play with her kids after all the traumas were over  she would not give me the meds. but rather would allow me to run and play  climb trees  chase and rough-house with her kids. wthen  when she related that to me a few years back  she said that after that span of several years of taking those sedatives  i was never the same. only she and my 1st grade teacher had the ability to relate to me and teach me. but  my thought processes were slow  i didn t register dangerous things or situations and would take risks beyond the norm for pre teen kids. such as riding a swing so hard  fast and high that i would loop it over the top supports. i could ignore pain and a host of other things like that. as i grew in to my teenage years  those problem areas  grew less and less until by the time i entered the navy  i was  normal  for the most part. i still  to this day  have to deal with certain things differently. after the friend told me all this  i went to a long time trusted md friend and asked him about the situation. he was unaware of my childhood traumas but as soon as i mentioned the sedatives  he let out a sigh of exasperation and said   i bet i know what that s    was and it s a thousand wonders you are still here.  he would not tell me what he thought the drugs were  but did emphatically say  if a doctor were to prescribe that junk to a child the age i was then  he would be run out of the medical field. he then  counseled me to do exactly what you are saying in this video. thank you so much p.n. for doing what you do and for caring so much for freedom and america. i wish i could meet you in person and learn more from you.
i m glad you brought this up .  man i thought it was just me . the system is screwed up and it took a turn for the worse in 2008 .  i m old school and have been taught the old ways . i m always polite and i won t be pawed at . i protect myself from the power they think they have over me .
what you say is so true. i don t know how many times in my younger years when my gut instinct told me to do or not to do something and later i could kick my rear end for brushing it off. now i m in my mid 60 s and have honed this god given gift to a well oiled skill.you are wise beyond your years. sometimes i have to lose one on purpose because my wife calls me a  know it all  if i m right too often.
i decided to stay away from doctors years ago.  i told myself i would go to a naturopath if necessary.  i have never gone to a naturopath because i find myself looking deep into myself  asking myself questions about what could be wrong and by doing this i seem to find the help and answers that i need.
indeed  lose one on purpose !  with all due respect  your wife should appreciate your wisdom to know - even if you are right  all the time.  hopefully  that one time you are intentionally wrong nothing bad happens to a loved one....
@macduece2112  i assure you the one s i lose are of very little consequence and are meant to be examples of humor.when you grow up and have a relationship with someone for decades you will understand that compromises are not at all really losses. you must lean to read between the lines. wisdom my boy  wisdom.
your message has struck a chord with me.  i lost my first wife age 34 to the medical   money monster. 2 botched surgeries and pills to  help . i have been learning about real food and natural remedies ever since. the video encourages me to continue... and forgive. shalom.
looked for a doctor for my kids and found one  on the phone they interviewed me quickly and one of the questions was are they up to date with their shots. i gave them my answer and they said they would refuse to see them unless they got the rest of them on their first visit! i said thank you but no thank you and hung up.  crazy world
4 avoid the va if you are a veteran. va motto   giving veterans a second chance to die for their country since 1930.
15 years ago around here  central florida  i watched as the 2 big hospital groups bought up as many as they could  smaller private medical practices  be it one doc or multiple doc practice. aside from throwing huge amounts of money at them to come work under their  brand   i think there was also certain threats of those who refused  to have their hospital privileges taken away. my 20 year family practice doc at the time had 2 other partners  and this got them broken up as only one went to the big hospital blanket group  my doc then when out on his own and the other doc went into plastic surgery so he did not have to deal with insurance. so  aside from docs being taught many wrong things by the institutional medicine colleges  they others are afraid  maybe over 90   to buck the system they now work under  and do what is  right and  do no harm .......we are not heading to a national and worldwide medical disaster  we are already there. great info in this video  ty patriot!!!!
good job!
same thing i went through. was close to 20 rejections until i found a place that would see my child.  he had some symptoms going on that required a medical checkup after we relocated..... they didn t care about that at all.  so much for pediatritions really caring about children huh!
you made m laugh!!
when i was in the army i had a chance to experience being under the command of the officers. when an officer joins active duty his first ranking is as a second lieutenant. it is a gold colored single bar or stripe for his rank insignation we called them a butter bar  the insignia looked just like a stick of butter in it s shape. the next rank was first lieutenant  and it was a silver bar. and then the next rank was a captain which was two silver bars joined. the ranking after that was major which was a gold leaf insignia. a lieutenant colonel was that same leaf insignia but it s color changed to silver. and then of course you have the generals. we used to remember the ranking by this little saying  be my little girl. b for a one-star brigadier general  m for a two-star major general  three stars for a lieutenant general  and  four stars for a general. so the   b m l g   in the phrase be my little girl was how we remembered the ranking. and the very last ranking for generals is a general of the army. it is a five-star general. he is appointed during wartime to be the general in charge of the whole army operation during the war. the last five-star general we had was during world war ii. i just mentioned all this in case anybody was interested in the rankings of army officers  and also as a prelude to a little story. we called second  lieutenants butterballs  like i said because they re insignia looks like a stick of butter. but we also said that a butterball doesn t have the sense to use the college education that they arrived with.  and there s truth in that  if it was not for the sergeants under the command of the butterball  the platoons would just fall apart. they relied on the experience of the sergeants. and that is the main thing  experience. in life  just as in the military with time and age comes experience. as an officer increases in rank and experience and time and service  he learns more things and you can rely on them to make the right decisions more often than not. it s the same in any profession in the world. especially in the medical field  a doctor gains experience also as time goes on. an old doctor can be a good doctor for you  he has common sense and many years of experience and if he s kept up with studies he also knows the new techniques. a young doctor  he has all the newest training  but perhaps not the common sense or experience to make the right decisions all the time. a middle-aged doctor is usually one that i recommend  because he has a good mix of it all. but even with that you have to be careful and picking your doctors. one thing that i look for is compassion. that is missing in so many doctors. you get a doctor with compassion  they will listen to you  they will feel your pain  they will trust perhaps that you are not lying  or they have the sense to tell when somebody is lying to them about a condition. i ve been lucky enough to find a few good doctors in my life here lately who have cared for me properly. but i have gone through many doctors in my life who i regret having ever seen. i ve had issues during my life that has caused me to experience the medical field from our side of it  the patient s side. honestly for the issues that i have in my life  i feel that i m more qualified to make a decision on a treatments that i get than the doctors at times. i have had to counter mand their decisions or their orders for treatment for me because i knew that they were wrong. just as in the shots that they give us nowadays  i do not take them. in the past i have taken a few flu shots but that was about 20 years ago  they never seem to work and sometime to even make me sick. i do not take them or even the current shots that they re pushing out for the charlie 19 that is going on. i have not caught the flu or hardly anything else in around 40 years. god gave us an immune system with this body which is beyond reproach. i rely on it  but you must also nourish it properly. make sure you are taking the right vitamins and other foods  and also make sure that you re not eating those things which are bad for you  sugar being one of them. i will not list all the supplements you should take  you can look that up yourself. to end this  i would say just be careful out there. do not trust everything that your doctors say. if you have the holy spirit in you  it will guide you and protect you if you listen to it. may god bless you  and i wish everyone many blessings for the future to come.
perfect example pn.. my mom s dr. said to her years ago   don t tell anybody i told you this cause they will kick me out of the ama  but apple cider vinegar eases arthritis ! it seems that whatever compounds in it get in between the cartilage that has dissipated and cousins  them from the bones!!  i tried it  sipping about a shot glass daily  and as nasty as that stuff tastes  it worked for me!! in pretty short order too! never have had a problem with that knee since!
i saw that military hierarchy in the medical system when my child was very ill and we lived in the hospital most of the time. their decisions are to benefit their careers  most aren t looking for your best interests.
thanks for all your advice  friend.   be my little girl....so easy to remember!
we all need to record our conversations with all the health care professionals we interact with imho because this madness will stop once we start filing criminal charges and then later comes the lawsuits. period! we need to use the courts they work for us.
i only helped my wife for 3 yrs with her gbm and you have to take charge as a caregiver.they gave her 6 mos and she lived 3 some good some bad but it was brutal but taught me many things and the head brain doctor sent me a letter thanking me and said she would have never made it that long without the alternative treatments and assistance from me and that i taught him a lot.i cried again.
thank you. i needed this advice. i plan on mixing it with fruit juice to make it go down easier.
apple cider vinegar soaked in cotton and placed in my ears improved my ear problems when doctors at the urgent care couldn t
we are so past that point. they have inserted the wicked in every high position. the only thing to be done now is pray. pray over you and your families life and have the lord s holy spirit guide you. we are in the end honestly
my husband had to have his appendix out this weekend. i was so sad seeing him in such pain.    i don t know what a second option would have been other than to remove it. please say prayers for him.
thank you for every word that roles out of your mouth!! a fellow nurse here!! no longer working in the healthcare field anymore!! boy  am i grateful!!
god bless you for doing all that you could for your beloved. you are an extraordinary human being.
thank you.i always knew it was what god intended for me to do.without him it wasn t possible.it was 3 years more that she lived.please say a prayer for me and my family.i think everybody is struggling with things.bless you.
@montbob100  i surely will pray for your family. you are such a brave soul.
@mary-ue4ir  thank you. i know it s been worse for others but i still have this guilt.
i  you all.i maybe shouldn t have brought this up but i was compelled to share.i don t want to be a victim.
@montbob100   i too still have guilt and regrets for many things in this mortal lifetime. i want to hold the intention that as i try to truly embrace forgiveness for the pain and suffering i ve experienced  in my life   that i will also move to an understanding of guilt and forgiveness that prods me to correct my own transgressions and feel forgiveness for what i ve done or said that brought pain and suffering to others.  i think guilt is like the divine watchdog of our self conscience and our sense of right and wrong. without guilt we see what is unfolding in the world today. by contemplating on what forgiveness is  it is love really  we give god the chance to expand our spiritual understanding and give us an opportunity to have guilt reside in it s proper proportion according to our intention and self correction. it s an opportunity for peace to abide in the heart where guilt was overwhelming us. i think guilt was one of the divine attributes embedded into our human dna to always be there in us  to guide us should we need a reminder or course correction.
how is he now   don t think you could have avoided that.
hopefully he didn t get one of the millions of medical mistakes that occur every year  nor get cross contaminated by a antibiotic resistant disease from personnel who don t follow protocol for cross contamination.
hi pn  as a nyc fireman i had such great respect for the medical profession  i am now many years into my retirement from there  but now i ve lost all confidence in it. i realize that there are some like you left. thank god for that !  god bless !
thank you for this awesome informative update! you always speak facts! i have a medical background and have been lucky blessed that i found medical professionals  doctors  nps  nurses  etc  who are open-minded   don t buy into the industrial medical complex. they don t recommend the  jab  and  off the record  commend me for holding firm in refusing to get it. it s hard to find medical professionals like these  but believe me  they are out there!
agree! in my opinion when you listen to your gut it s the holy spirit warning you!
i am a nurse too. living in uk but from eastern europe. all my life i had in the house all the meds and bandages i needed for any emergency  flu or bacterial infection  antibiotics  steroids... last year i had a holiday in mexico and bought loads of antibiotics as in uk they only prescribed them if you are dying and i always needed them for chest infections or tonsillitis throughout my life. i know what to do when my dog is ill and i know what to do for almost everything unless surgery is needed. so screw doctors and politicized medicine. everyone should star learning how to be their own doctor these days  those scumbag gps here google symptoms and definitely know less than me. people who trust doctors are in for a bad ride. i recently repaired my dog s acl with supplements  physio and red laser therapy on my own while vet wanted to operate and replace her cartilage with some plastic. i also improved my mother s osteoarthritis and osteoporosis symptoms with supplements  diet and getting her off the toxic meds she was prescribed. when health is concerned these days it is all about money so i trust no one but me.
100 . as a fellow awake rn  you re a breath of fresh air. may our lord continue to provide us the courage to speak truth and stand on it  no matter the costs.
could you please give advice on how to find an np
only if you re saved!
amen  yes  holy spirit will warn you!   always listen!!!
any particular supplements for arthritis  my dogs ok for now but never know.
@katen1228  glucosamine and chondroitin  omega 3 fish oil  turmeric and green lipped mussel extract
tart cherry for arthritic pain.  everyone who uses this says it really helps.  there are other benefits to eating tart cherry as well.
@charliepiston3169  for dogs
i feel the same way about modern medicine and the so called medical experts. have you tried  oil of oregano supplement or just eating raw garlic instead of antibiotics
@wiz4020  no. not needed. not gonna eat all supplements out there
@wiz4020  yes more effective anyway and grows right around u! always something we need in our community  hashem provides.
@chadzwife1  i agree with you completely!
@chadzwife1  that is why i am making stocks now for the following years. yes  i know about herbs  born in eastern europe where we had loads of herbal teas and plant and bee products used for illnesses.
amen patriot  nurse! i am thankful  for your boldness  and wisdom. thank you
this is very timely information for me right now. ssdi suspended my monthly payment because i haven t been to a white coat doctor in 7 yrs. literally was told   you are disabled. you have to see a doctor  i have a neurological slash  spinal cord disorder i was born with. the only treatment is pill . lots of them and they do not improve my ability to function. i have been stranded  voluntarily  since 2020 in mexico. warm weather and fresh food and sunshine is my prescription. i am so irritated that i have to return. knowing these tidbits of information tpn shared today made me very aware i am entering into a different health scare world. i will be on my best behavior
keeping my mouth shut is my biggest challenge  unfortunately. i ve had several confrontations with medical  professionals  since the start of covid. i had one just last week where an np called social services on me over an elderly man i care for who had an accident in his adult diaper during the office visit. the np already didn t like me and was looking for a reason  particularly that day as it was very cold and her office wanted to force him to stand outside while they checked other people in. i wasn t about to allow that to happen  and it didn t.i knew she would call just by her demeanor. i wasn t concerned. they visited along with his home health nurse but everything was found to be in order  as i knew it would be. all the np managed to do was make an idiot of herself.
what part of mexico is safe
@debihester7284  most all of it. the cartels here are not as aggressive as those in the north at the border. there is no danger to tourists unless they are looking for trouble. honestly  i feel so safe where i am  costa oaxaca.  where i am going  tiny town co. guarantee they lock the door. i don t lock my door at night here.   it is not necessary. the culture  here anyway  is very kind and respectful. there are petty crimes  but it is typically committed by a non-local. this is a small rural beach town. i am here 3yrs.i have been all the way to bolivia. i have had such amazing experiences with strangers. i go with my gut feelings when it comes to hopping into a jeep and having a peruvian drive me 2hrs up the andes to meet his aunt and uncle who farmed and raised llamas. yes  i did that. i also traveled about 1500 miles on the amazon river on the local cargo boats. not luxurious at all. roughing it. the people are kind and helpful. just like in anywhere  there are dangerous areas.
fill the script  but don t take them. tell the doc you are taking them. throw them in the trash.
my daughter received a letter from her children s pediatrician that they were dropping her family because she refused to follow the cdc s recommendation for vaccination.
bless you for putting this out.i ve been going through an egocentric power struggle with my spouse who is blindly  compliant  and doesn t dare question the  official  narrative status credentials  of those in positions of  power .he keeps trying to push me back into a medical system of systematic gender-biased abuse i endured since childhood that i totally pushed away from my life the past few years. i experienced 1st hand just how toxic and narcissistic the system is and that my own best interests were null and void with them.trying to explain to a spouse who witnessed me getting sicker and sicker  in  the system  yet tries to push me back in it through invalidation and dismissive mindset turning a blind eye and deaf ear in their own cognitive dissonance is my main current battle now.i just learning how to shut them all out and be dome with them all  because i will only comply with myself and my one true god!
i m in the belly of the beast in the ne and this information is truthful and accurate. appreciate you spreading the message.
wish i had seen this video a few years ago. trusted a surgeon for back surgery  lamanectomy  that he badly botched causing me to be disabled and in severe pain. after being prepped i had a strong feeling not to have the surgery but i didn t want to be seen as questioning the surgeon. very bad decision that ruined my life.
i learned a lesson when i was in my early 40 s and my doctor pur me on actonel for bone loss. i got ulcers in my ephosogas. then i read the info packet that came with the drug and i ve been reading them ever since. he was my family doctor and while i still go to him i always ask questions and have refused to take some drugs because i didn t think they were right for me. he really pushed me for the jab and i told him i didn t want to take a chance on side effects. he s left me alone about it since then. i totally agree with you about following that little voice. the holy spirit wants to give us wisdom and direction. thank you for what you do
that is good news because now you know you need a different pediatrician immediately!
for kicks  tell them you ll be suing them into oblivion in an official looking letter.
the docs get kickbacks from giving jabbies.
@oldnavyluver83  pediatricians make tons of money from their helpful little jabs.
@garrett621  yuppp.... i m in medical
omg.
time for that spouse to go too
i was bullied by female drs to give my then  13 yr old the new hpv vac.  i declined  i knew she didn t need it  plus it was brand new.  i said i would look into it.  they called me a bad mother  irresponsible  etc.  i couldn t believe it.  so glad i did not agree with them.  my daughter is grateful too.  this was 11 years ago.
i am an rn for 45 years.  this is excellent information!
so sorry to hear this.
i know this may sound off the wall but i am following a dr john bergman on youtube who is a chiropractor but gives a lot of in depth  advice for all sorts of things and one thing i learnt from him is that bone and joints surgery is 90  of the time for the benefit of the surgeon and not the patient. and speaking of that... my dog ruptured her acl in a back leg knee and vet wanted to replace the cartilage with some synthetic stuff. i said no  vet was angry and did not even tell me what brace or painkillers to use for the dog. i did my online research and thank god for many youtube holistic vets... now my dog runs and jumps again with no surgery. many of the joints and bones problems are fixable with diet  supplements and physio. my mother also had osteoporosis and osteoarthritis in knees and poor mobility  was prescribed zolendronic acid which is toxic  eats into your jaw bone  has serious side effects... after 1 week she refused to take it. i watched a few drs on youtube and put her on supplements and she is so mobile now she walks my dog every day for 2 hours. never trust a doctor without doing your research.
accupuncture  friend. also above the person who suggested chiropractic.
@redrumax    my dog cracked her pelvis in two places. emerg vet was honest in telling me she could heal on her own without surgery if i kept her from running  jumping for 6-8 wks. i kept her in playpen and supported her with towel sling to do her business. i bought a stroller that we still like to use.   she has healed with no sign of injury.   injury was 3 yrs ago and she now 13 running and playing.
i m so sorry to hear this. i had an  emergency  microdiscectomy and laminectomy last july that i felt pressured into. they made me feel like there were no other options. recovery has been rough and i m not a lot better. wish i had given myself more time to think about it. praying for your healing  sorry you had to deal with this.
@dontstepinthegrease  you are a good dog mamma. i also did not let mine jump or run  she was laid on my bed and me working from home screaming  sit  whenever i had to wash dishes so she would not come to kitchen with me... paid off... now she is running and jumping
@redrumax    thank you.  animals are truly amazing.
dr eric berg and dr. mandel  motivationaldoc on youtube have taught me a lot about my body and how to care for this temple best. yes we can!
thank you for this helpful video. as a lifelong heart patient myself  and with the help of my parents  i have learned that it s okay to say no or to be an advocate for yourself. years ago  after a third readjustment surgery  i was given two different types of studies. one was more of a cognitive study  for learning more about my disability. for my participation  i would be receiving  100.  i went felt okay with proceeding and and later received the promised amount.   the other study was for an experimental drug treatment. this study would pay me  400 for compensation. although i was a little tempted at the increased amount of money  the more i thought about the bigger picture  especially possible side effects   i had a stupor of thought.  one day  as i was reviewing the study with my mom  i told her that maybe god was giving us a stupor of thought about the drug trial and i chose not to participate.   i don t remember which drug it was  i kinda wish i wrote it down to see if it had received any lawsuits   but i am grateful i was wise enough to know that the money would have been temporary and the effects of the drug could be more long lasting.another time for decision making came years later  years before covid  when i had excessive swelling. at the time i was still at the children s hospital  having not quite  graduated  even though i had been in my early 20 s. although they did an abdominal drain  all the fluid came right back.   instead of adjusting the dose for my diuretics  my doctors immediately jumped to a transplant option  i ve been born with a defect  so it s been assumed that i will eventually need one .   well after doing some tests and research of my own  as i was reviewing a book on transplants  i at first was curious and a bit excited. having survived several heart surgeries myself  i thought it would be as easy as my other surgeries. however  as i read and learned more about the possible challenges that come with a transplant  i felt more trapped. i even had someone who had had a heart and liver transplant. while i was happy for them  i wasn t sure i wanted to be more controlled than i already felt with my current condition.   i also noticed that as i read the transplant book and tried to consider this path  i felt myself feeling like i wanted to escape. i felt myself panicking inside and squirming in my seat.   it was then i realized that i wasn t feeling peace  like my option to try an experimental drug years ago. when i talked with my mom and the doctors  i had my meds adjusted and i felt a sense of relief! i felt better and i was glad for once again  listening to the promptings god had given to me.i am also grateful for my mom  and dad  when he isn t working at his job  in being with me during doctor visits. not only does she have intuition  which i have learned from her   but she has shown me that she is not afraid to ask questions like   why does she need this treatment  test  etc.    or  how is this  x  y  z  supposed to help  benefit her   or  what happens if she does not have  x  y  z   or   what happens if .... happens    etc.
i m a senior and only take one medication. i feel  i m healthy.  i recently received a lengthy health survey from my insurance company.  they let you know that this is important and to fill it out and return.  after reviewing the questions i made the decision to not fill out the survey or return it  no explanation. i don t know if its the same everywhere but if i ever have to call my insurance company  for any reason  i guarantee you your day will be gone because with one phone call and one simple question this will put you into some twilight zone of being transferred from one agent to the next  minutes on the phone turns into hours. so i m done  no more.  i m sure they re aware that i m not compliant.  bottom line  i m not going to get on their treadmill of yearly routine tests and constant need to badger me for something they want so that they can keep busy and use my life to do that.    i actually  i don t think i even have a doctor at this time.  if i get one i know the insurance company or whom ever this doctor works for is going to hold up their clip board and make checks as i say no to all of their questions and requests. i don t think there are doctors any more. i think professionals only ask the questions they are allowed to ask and feed the responses into the computer that makes all the decisions. nope  not going along with this.
50  of all doctors graduated in the bottom half of their class.
as a retired nurse i 100  agree with everything you have said. i so appreciate what you are doing! god bless you and keep you  and make his face shine upon you!
this hits hard. when i was 6 years old my parents took me to the local hospital because i had a lot of pain in my abdomen. the doctor told them there was nothing wrong with me. my mother  an rn  had my dad drive us 90 miles  at night in a montana winter  where i was diagnosed with appendicitis. surgery happened immediately which possibly saved my life. lesson learned... doctors are smart but not all seeing all knowing gods.
refreshing to see  hear  and take in such wisdom. i have been a proponent of intuition since i was a teenager. alone  for the most part   i advocated this natural vibrational intake to be my guiding light  as it were. unfortunately this has been met with great resistance from both sides of the issue. on one hand i have the secular side promoting faith and that knowledge is not for us mere mortals and on the other are those that  know better  telling me how and what to be or do. so  thank you patriot nurse  for breathing life into what i deep down have known almost all my life!bless you child of god  bless you!
amen 100 . i have dealt with a few outright psychotic  health care providers.  my routine before a medical experience is  plenty of sleep  shower  psalm 91.
i feel exactly the same way!!!!!
that s a great point   something to chew on always
80  of doctors are employees so....they do what they re told or else.
@johnpruett5258  80     i m betting it more like 98
@swisschalet1658  slaves to   .
like all areas in it for the money
@johnpruett5258  their employers are basically big-pharma..   as are their educators at  medical  school  the schools are greatly influenced    by them .
somewhere is the worst doctor in the world  and more than likely  they are shielded by bureaucracy from accountability or scrutiny. probably work for cdc who  or un. those that can do  and those that can t teach and promote what makes them rich.
so glad to see you back.     the hair.  enjoyed the video.  dr s hate me because i tell them what i will take and what i won t.  i know what my body says they don t.  i m glad to hear you say to all that we need to stop letting the medical world just prescribe whatever the latest money maker to make money.  they don t care about the patient anymore.  i say all the time... dr s work for us  they are not our boss.  they have the ability to prescribe us mess  but we do not have to take them just because a dr said to. i question everything.
this speaks to me so loudly. thank you. i don t need psychotropic drugs. i just need beers and sunshine
my grandpa used to say   someone had to graduate bottom of the class.  he not only had doctors that seemed to be in that category but his insurance dropped him when he got cancer  1960 s .
the best health care provider i ever had was mom. a very intuitive woman.
amen
and wine... maybe a little weed lol!!!!
@southerncharm1382  just a little  whoops
the doctor many of my family loved really tried to pressure them into the jab for my mother  now 89. my sister almost caved. we insisted  no . the doctor hasn t mentioned it again. i finally got a primary care doctor last spring. he was thorough and i liked him. when he asked if i was up to date on the jabs  i formed my index fingers into an  x . after looking a little surprised i told him i would not be having it and i hoped he would still be my doctor. we moved on.  he was lovely and i feel blessed.
hi patriot nurse!  love your videos!  my story is too long to tell.  no vax of any kind.  got thru covid ok.  bad drs for 10 yrs.  brain tumor undiagnosed.  good now.  never again to trust anyone but our lord and saviour and my instincts.   god bless you.  you are a blessing to me and i am hoping to take a class in person with you in the future.
i wholeheartedly believe in intuitive wisdom. god gave us brains  hearts  minds  and eyes  and the power to think and learn for ourselves. thank you for encouraging us  patriot nurse!
oh my gosh!!!! perfect timing patriot nurse!!!! cps will be at my house in the morning because my sister in law called them because i decided to homeschool and not get them vaxed. they are not even legally required to be in school until next year. the pediatrician totally talked down to me last week when i didn t let them give my boys anything. you are scaring me cause i had to tell the doctor i was nervous because she wanted to vax him that day.
i stopped trusting the medical field a long time ago. i could say that i lost confidence when acls standards were dumbed down. or when twelve leads appeared in every doc in a box and aed s on every street corner  even though ekg machines have always  diagnosed  heart rythims and been wrong! . or maybe it was when emt-b s started becoming  tactical   which i find hilarious! . or maybe it s all of the diversity hires  sure  all of those a part of my lack of trust. but the main thing that everybody should be very concerned about is the fact that the majority of young doctors  nurses  and paramedics can t write in cursive. and if that doesn t makes sense to anyone reading this...hmm....i don t know what to tell you.
listening to this filled me with renewed appreciation for our chill  helpful  and respectful ped.  i need to send him a thank you
absolutely.  if you have a good doc  hold on to them and love on them!
you are so needed in this climate of self-indulgent  prideful  insensitive individuals. i am a firm believe at 71 of being my own healthcare advocate  and i heartily concur with everything you have just shared. it is amazing to me when people including my own family refuse to ask questions or do their own research on issues pertaining to themselves. i grew up with my dad owning nursing homes back in the 60s 70s and it wasn t great back then in their treatment of older people and today it is that way no matter what your age and much worse. i really hope your channel will open the eyes of many people who start putting two and two together. i so wish it didn t have to be this way  but unfortunately we are all partakers of this medical maze seemingly rigged with some sort of explosive no matter where we turn  and it is crucial we become educated so that we can make the best possible choice  that is available to us and our families.
even with my stroke affected brain - i knew i knew not to take it!
this is a really timely video. i worked my whole career doing direct patient care  and i wish everyone understood how corrupted the medical industry is. this video should be reviewed by anyone considering engaging with the medical system.
thank you for your videos... i watch as i can from time to time....i thought i d share my experience with our so called  health care system   and how it has destroyed our lives over the years  and even though my husband and i are only 60  neither one of us can work  and quite frankly  due to our health issues caused by prescription meds  life sucks!  this is not a complete compilation of what we ve experienced over the last 23  years  but you will get a small taste of what we ve been through! i apologize for the length  but perhaps someone else can learn from what we ve experienced  and if they have questions  they can reply below. i don t trust too many in the medical field either! after years of believing in the  medical professionals .... we were starting to experience more problems  not less. in 1999  my husband was diagnosed with diabetes.... the hospital basically told him he had diabetes and sent him on his way with very little information about how to manage it and prescription medications.... just like they do with all diabetes patients! we live in florence  sc and we had to kind of figure it out for ourselves  fortunately  my brother has had diabetes for years  gave us more tips and information than the hospital did! he was able to go back to work  but he really had to pay attention to how he was feeling  because as a restaurant manager at the time  his blood sugar would spike or drop. at one time  he called me and told me i had to come and get him  he couldn t see and he had a migraine headache!  i didn t know anything at that point like i do now  but it was crazy trying to figure things out  and back then  we didn t have the resources like we do now on the internet.  my husband has gone through so many medical problems since 1999  one of them being metformin causing his migraines  i figured that out and explained my beliefs to the neurologist at the va years later. she took him off of the oral medications  and put him on insulin  and that helped almost immediately! prior to that  he went to a local neurologist who  instead of trying to figure out what the problem was  just pushed more and more prescriptions to try  each of them having worse side effects than the one prior! i got disgusted and signed up for va care  even though the hospital was 2 hours away  1 way  it was better than what we were getting with that quack!  long story short  within 2 years he developed diabetic amyotrophy neuropathy  a rare form of neuropathy that almost killed him! this was back in 2010  i believe he is still alive because i payed attention to what was going on and took time to learn about what he was going through on line as the years went by.  he was in so much intense pain  severely  that he was put on the highest dose of morphine and a bunch of other medications that they prescribed because they really didn t  know what they were dealing with... now  he is at stage 4 kidney failure!!!  they were sending him to nephrologists who i don t believe they knew what they were talking about at the first stage of kidney failure  and over the years  none of them ever talked about going to a renal dietician to teach us about what foods he should stay away from and what foods he could and should eat!  he has decided that he doesn t want to go through dialysis because he would not be able to go through a kidney transplant since his immune system is still in bad shape  and because he would have to take medications that would lower his immune system even more so that his body wouldn t reject the kidney transplant  it would kill him anyway! so rather than go through all of that  we are watching his diet carefully  now that i know what to do and if you have kidney disease  i highly recommend checking out dadvice.tv on you tube... great resource!  i also know people who are currently going through dialysis and one of the guys explained that during treatments  he gets really bad cramping in his legs  kind of like when you go on a run and you don t have enough fluids  not enough water  potassium  etc.  in my husband s case  during the beginning phase of diabetic amyotrophy neuropathy  the nerves in his body were destroying the muscles  turning them to liquid  and caused his legs to spasm so badly it looked like his legs were going through convulsions! the er doctors said it was sciatica .... i didn t believe them either  and all they did was prescribe more prescription drugs to  take care of the problem .... i now believe his body was reacting to all of the toxins from the prescription drugs he had been given over the years... that is when i really started to question  modern medicine !!!   so for him to go through dialysis now  especially since his leg muscles never truly recovered or healed properly  would be like reliving that whole experience all over again!!  it is his choice  and doesn t want to do dialysis.... and the last nephrologist he was going to kept pushing dialysis  home dialysis  and we kept telling him no!  we stopped going to him all together!  his primary care physician at the va who has known him since she first saw him in 2010 and knows what he experienced   says she respects his decision and is willing to work with him and his needs.  she has always been respectful of his decisions  and i like her for that reason  hence why i say there s not too many i trust in the health care industry  she s an exception!i have learned a lot about my own personal health and health issues on you tube from doctors of natural medicine like dr. john bergman who has hundreds of great videos on how the body works  what prescription drugs do to the body  and a whole lot of other great resources i have learned from  great resources if anyone is interested!  dr. josh axe is also a doctor of natural medicine and he teaches a lot about what and how foods and minerals help the body heal better than medications  as a matter of fact  he helped his mother go from stage 4 lung cancer to no cancer without chemo and all of the crazy treatments she went though 5 years prior when she had breast cancer and had to go through the chemo and a double mastectomy when josh was still in high school. her video is also on you tube  on his channel. she felt so much better and healed her body naturally  got rid of what was causing her cancer.... and the oncologists were dumbfounded because even though she wasn t doing chemo again  they watched her cancer shrink every time they did an mri expecting it to get worse  and eventually the cancer was gone and hasn t been back since!  most prescriptions are the problem..... not the solution!!!  however  to those who have been on prescription medications  work with your doctor to come off of them since stopping suddenly could also be fatal!  another clue that it is poisonous... not helpful!  for the last 23 years  my husband and i have had to deal with health care.... i would say for the last 17 years  we ve gone through the va.... government health care.... we are 60 years old and should be enjoying life... instead  we are in constant pain from the moment we get up in the morning to the time we go to bed.... we take tylenol when we absolutely need it  and even that is just as bad as prescription meds  bad for the kidneys  liver  etc!  we don t have  health care   we have  sick care   because it isn t profitable for big pharma to make us all healthy!  follow the money and the politicians who are being paid off by big pharma lobbyists!  greed has taken over health care.... i am disgusted by it all!
east tennessee usa        always good advice! many thanks to you pn for always speaking the truth!!!
stand firm and don t cave!
@ erin parker  don t they have exemptions for immunizations in your state  that would allow your children to attend school. you don t have a decent sister-in-law  for sure. she should respect   stay out of your decisions. i have one homeschooling daughter who does not immunize  and three other daughters who have exemptions  whose children attend school. my youngest stopped immunizations when one of her children broke out in measles  less than three weeks after measles vaccine. i have two little grandsons with serious vaccine injuries  and others that we believe we re affected as well.
my paternal grandmother and my mother were both nurses   grandma was at verdun in wwi.  they both taught me growing up to never ever trust a doctor.  every time i did  i lived to regret it  just like they warned me...  they would both have loved you!  god bless  you re doing the budda s work.
in may 2020  i was very healthy and strong and had a routine physical scheduled with my female medical doctor of  4 years. the you know what wasn t available yet  but she asked me how i was feeling about getting it. i told her very honestly i would not because i knew bg was a eugenicist  i knew his role in event 201  i had researched deeply and besides i she knew i had struggled for 32 years with lyme disease and had experienced serious anaphylactic shock several times from lyme treatment and i was not going  to risk my health with anything experimental!  she got very angry  seething that she d have to take it and told me i could just stay locked up at home for good!  she defended bg and his wife as the greatest philanthropists  on earth. she told me to prepare for my internal exam  left and came in the exam room  pretended to put lube on her gloves and hand raped me brutally. i was so damaged i had to be referred to a specialist by another doctor in the practice. i could not walk for a week  i could not put in a garden until july.  a word to the wise is never anger one of these people with the truth  before they are about to lay hands on you!
was diagnosed  by in e.r doctor  with shingles. knew that was not the case. went to my primary doctor and was diagnosed with pulmonary embolisms! trust your spiddy senses!!
i am so thankful i found your channel. i agree  you must question things that don t feel right and i always question no how many letters are after a name. my horror story was at a small local hospital that is part of a larger hospital corporation. my husband and i were living with my 98 year old grandmother because i had promised she would never go into a nursing home. one evening my husband started having severe pain in stomach area  called his rn daughter to take him to er. in er he was asked if he drank alcohol and he answered yes  occasionally a couple of beers. he was admitted with pancreatitis. he has had multiple back surgeries and i had always stayed with him in the hospital  however  because of my grandmother i was unable to stay this time. i assumed since his daughter worked on the floor he would be safe. wrong i visited every morning and he was in pain but seemed fine. on the 3rd afternoon she called me crying  she said something is very wrong. i found someone to stay with my grandmother and went the 2 miles to the hospital. it was like he was out of his head  talking crazy. i went to nurses station and asked what meds he was being given. the doctor had taken off all of his meds  he had been taking pain meds for his back for 8 years  and was giving him iv designed for alcoholics. i asked how much of the pain medication he had been given over his stay  the nurse told me and then said  you are on the right track . i immediately called our independent pharmacist  told him what was going on and asked what the symptoms would be. he described what i was seeing and told me he was in withdrawals and to immediately give him his medication. he asked if i could get him out of there. i requested to speak to the dr and was told he would not be back until morning so i asked to speak to the hospital administrator. i spoke with the administrator in person at 11pm explained the situation and requested my husband be released as soon as the dr made rounds or i would walk him out myself and they could figure out how insurance would pay.the next morning with the administrator in the room  the doctor tried to refuse to release him and the told me i was naive because i was dealing with a closet alcoholic. i turned to the administrator and said we are leaving and do not even attempt to send me a bill. i found out later in the day that pancreatitis runs in my husband s family with one aunt dying from it and she never drank alcohol. never leave someone alone in the hospital. my husband has had multiple surgeries and i always pack for 2. i enter and leave when he does. it may be inconvenient but it is a lifesaver.if you find yourself in the hospital always carry a bag with cleaning supplies. lysol wipes and spray. i spray down everything each time someone comes and leaves. better safe than sorry.
me too!
i agree as well. i saw your video before going to see a gi doc for first time. i have never seen such a robotic existence in my life!!! waited an hour to see the np and she was nice and listened as i told her my history because they don t ask that anymore! after 30 more minutes  i heard her say outside the exam roomi m sorry dr. you have one more. doc says i was about to leave np says i m sorry i was in there a long time!!!!!!are you effing kidding me!!! she was in with me less than 10 mins. he comes in and spends 5 minutes. i am going back as i do need these issues tended to while i still can. btw i was a nurse 30 yrs ago when people really cared. the best thing i ever got out of my degree    how to understand medical issues for my family
glad to hear you believe in god.  few do these days.  that s why we re in the situation we re in!
you are right to bring cleaning products. i was a nurse for 25 years. one of my coworkers and i began to question how well our rooms were being cleaned. we worked in an ob triage area that closed when we got off work each evening at 7 and was to be cleaned by the housekeeping department each night. we began to  leave things   to see if it would be cleaned properly. i went to administration many times regarding the lack of cleanliness. one time i noted the same sheet on a used bed that was made to look like the room had been cleaned and made all nice and tidy. i was outraged and gave them a piece of my mind advocating for my patients. i m scared for any of my family members to be hospitalized.
sure that it wasn t the doctor s medical assistant who roomed you in the exam room  i am a medical assistant   i had worked for a while at a gi clinic. we are expected to get the patient s vitals  cover any medications they are taking if any  cover any personal   family medical history   see if they have had any surgeries or prior colonoscopies in under 5 minutes  preferably a lot less time. some medical clinics actually time the ma while rooming patients. one place i worked at had a doctor who only did 10 minute appts with patients   all of the mas were expected to get all this done in 45 seconds. impossible!!
we can always count on patriot nurse to give us the straight cause and answer!!! it s just up to us to take it seriously.  thank you patriot nurse  always a thumbs up and we always love your spirit and honesty!!!  d
correct patriot nurse!! god gave us both an inner knowing of proper plants for healing   and a sense of what is right and wrong. our current society is pushing for central narrative to be the   right  way.
right on advice from a reluctant participant in the  system  for the past 3 yrs since i had a heart attack diabetes lung infection during covid scare times...i found out the hard way when the hospital locked me up on a covid floor and didn t let me have contact with my family for 3 days and nights....kept insisting i had covid from symptoms even though i tested 3 times negative...was put on psychotic drugs for  anxiety  because i was upset and didn t want to have a ventilator and a mask strapped to my head...that experience was a nightmare.  thankfully my god intervened for me and got me out of that nightmare...but in all that no one told me i had the right to say no to anything....i just did say no because my gut told me so.  god saw me through my hospital stays and sent me a wonderful christian cardiac doctor and sent me praying chaplains   nurses.  thank you for speaking the truth.  i m well but stuck on 9 different medications  .  that i want off of and have discussed this with my doctor and his response was  it s for life...i m trying to keep you out of the hospital .  i m complying now because they did save my life  but i know in my  gut  that some of the medications can be stopped.  i need to lose weight and once i do i ll be aggressively trying to get off the medications.
i appreciate your channel! watching your videos makes me feel less alone  and that makes such a difference!
my husband went against 2 doctors. one that said he recommended the clot shot and the other one that tried to put him on an injectable for cholesterol. doctors get highly offended when you do not listen to them!
well said. proverbs 2 6 for the lord gives wisdom  out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
dear lady. you are a true american treasure. you are always a blessing to us all. and we thank you and we bless you. happy new year!
everytime i went to my dr  he would try to convince me to get it but he never crossed the line. the last time i told him that i was waiting to see what happens to people who did get and then maybe i will. he hasn t brought it up since.
exactly why i don t go to a doctor or take prescription medication
i am 1000 percent sure that  problem child  is etched in permanent red sharpie all over my health records and i wear it with pride! as a young teen  doctors could never  find  the cause of my abdominal pains. i endured tests after tests. as a child bearing adult  i went through 10 miscarriages prior to 8 weeks gestation. test after test and  nothing  was found to be wrong. in my 50 s a 1mm breast tumor was found and i agreed to surgery. the doctor said  the tumor was not very impressive  but since a couple of lymph nodes contained  cancer cells  they pushed for  badgered me  and tried to put the fear of death into me if i didn t do chemotherapy. i listened to that still small voice inside of me that was screaming  don t do this!  and 5 years later  god still has me here. that was a turning point for me. i refuse all  health maintenance   tests now and have received no shots since. i worked in the medical field most of my life and i have seen how it is driven by money and i refuse to participate anymore. it is rare for me to even see a doctor now.
i had a meet n greet interview such as this and based on her take of not following to the letter about medical advice from the past was told i am not suitable patient material and would be put back on a list for other doctors...this clinic like all others in this province bc  have strict guidelines about the wearing of n95 masks...  yet while this private interview was conducted at no time was this doctor observing the rules by wearing said mask  i was masked up ...this hypocracy is beyond crazy!!!!
outrageous!!!!!!
pn  excellent explanation of the truth. your classes have been an absolute lifesaver.
definitely a blessing right on time.  i have an appointment with a new nurse practitioner and was going to treat it like an interview.  thanks for the advice of not giving up much information.  god bless you
patriot nurse thank you for this video. less than 5 years ago my hubby was running 5 miles a day  are extremely healthy and hasn t ever been hospitalized. for four months he was seeing his doctor telling him he wasn t feeling well  shortness of breath  a cough that just wouldn t go away. it was all i could do to try to convince him to go see another doctor. it came to a head in the fifth month. he couldn t rest  even texted me that i wasn t to allow our grandson to wake him up in the morning that i needed to come wake him up. i went in told him if you feel that if you re feeling that impending feeling of doom to get dressed i was taking him to the hospital. it took twenty minutes for him to get dressed because he was so short of breath and had no energy. once we got to the emergency room he walked maybe 30-40 feet into the emergency room and was so out of breath he was gasping. he couldn t even speak to give his information to the person behind the counter. i told her that he s short of breath and had this coughing for four months or longer. she could see right away that he wasn t well and took us straight back. the doctor could hear him gasping and coughing as we walked down the hallway. i heard him tell the patient he was seeing he would be right back. as we got into the room and they hooked everything up to check his vitals it was very apparent that something was horribly wrong. the doctor knew as soon as he stepped in the room that he was ordering a mri. the doctor came back twenty minutes later with a nurse saying do you want the good news or bad news first. doctor then said  the good news is we know exactly what s wrong with you  the bad news is we re looking for a intensive care bed for you at the surrounding hospitals. he then told my husband that had he gone back to sleep like he wanted to that he would have died in a couple hours. he had passed so many blood clots through his heart into his lungs that they couldn t count them  and he had a blood clot stuck between his heart and lungs. the doctor said he would have drown in his own blood. the worst part of it all was not once did the doctor he saw two days before or over the last four months even do a chest x-ray   i was so angry. just because a person is healthy and eats right doesn t mean that they can t have something wrong with them. hubby spent 10 days total in the hospital. 7 if those in intensive care. we received a call from his doctor saying that they wanted to make a follow up appointment after his hospital stay. nope never happing because i made a appointment with a new doctor for him. the old doctor basically saw our insurance and knew that we were a gravy train. he had ordered useless tests over a four month period but never took a simple chest x-ray that would have shown that he was passing blood clots. thank you patriot nurse for all your doing to help everyone. much love from our family to your family
although i have to admit that i don t understand everything you say  i understand the basics and truly appreciate your information and heads up warnings...your encouragement and confirming we should listen to our gut means a lot!  we have been doing that since c-19 started.  many have not and have died because of this  including my mom last spring...sad but true...thank you again patriot nurse! god bless.
you are a beacon of light and knowledge. wish we had a lot more medical people with your honesty
even the docs are being bullied  talked to one in miami while i was on vacation in a hotel  she said they came in  expected them to get the jab  she did it to keep her job. she said she never saw the person in the hospital that was demanding it...somebody came from outside to enforce it.  she said she regrets it  but all her colleagues did it and they refuse to discuss the effects of it with her.
thank you  patriot nurse! i learned a lot today.
she should have refused it  flat out. it doesn t make any difference if everyone else got it. if everyone jumped off a bridge  are you going to too
i had to be in a hospital last fall. i heard what sounded like a an elderly woman and later what sounded like a 7-9 year old child who were screaming  no  i don t want it  or something to that effect as they were forced to undergo some sort of treatment.
the rare times that i ever go to a medical practitioner i always book the appointment as a consultation only. that makes my intentions very clear right up front that i want their opinion and advice but i will be making the decision. that has worked very well.
i m definitely stuck in that pattern where the dr knows all that s best for me  and if i disagree  then i m just stupid. i need a hip replacement. my ekgs all come up normal. but the surgeon is insisting i do a medically induced stress test  injected directly unto my heart!!! upon researching it  there are two main contrasts dyes  both of which are declared lethal in e every country on the planet  except the u.s.!!! geena norris  wife of chuck norris had such an injection for an mri. she almost died and is still battling the side effects! so  um  nope!!! not sure what to do at this point.
got it! we need more people like you in the medical field. keep up the good work. thank you for everything you do inform people  and give care to people. this video was a blessing. best wishes and blessings to you.
i have to say you are brave to speak the truth about the people in white coats!
get rid of this doctor
say no to the stress test. i like the other reply that says get rid of the doctor too.
i honestly feel its about money...the more tests and procedures the more money....
shalom  this lady speaks the truth  and its going to get much worse.
patriot nurse  you are spot on! when i try to share this outlook with some family and coworkers i get the  you re crazy  look. i am somuch happier after taking back my power and initiative. very scary at first. this applies to many areas in life where we give our power away to people of supposed authority. spiritual  medical governmental  employers.... it goes on and on. thank you for this channel. be blessed!
agreed.however  we can prepare better and not be part of the negative consequences.
not for those of us with eyes to see and ears to hear truth.
that was wonderful! and i agree! it s not just in medical but in education. i had educators tell me that my daughter had autism and after two rounds of assessment  one through a government department which was not fully completed  and one through my own intervention  we found that she was not autistic but she was diagnosed with adhd has been medicated and for the rest of her schooling didn t really much better. my son  adhd medicated and doing awesome in his final year of school and obtaining a s andb s. it was out of my intuition as their parent that we took this road in order to prove to certain parties that my children we not going to be placed in a box with a label on it that didn t fit their description. parents are the ones who are in charge here at the end of the day  with medical providers and education providers assisting and this is what we forget. i m in australia and this information you have given on this video completely fits the bill here also. so thankyou and god bless you for your work in helping others to see what they can do to take back the control over their lives medically.
i am a hospital rn and have learned ask questions  weigh my benefit risk ratio  and being able to tell the doctor  i m ok with dying. also needing to advocate for your kids will mean  you will not be liked  but you can get the best care  gotta be in the room by 5 00am every day with lists .
thank you patriot nurse for this video.i tried to share it on facebook and they won t let me.they are  saying other people find this content as abusive.so much for free speech.
thank you  pn  for your wisdom in this area!! appreciate all you do.
great advice. i have used the yeah my kids are up to date on jabs response often. i know that due to where they were born they only ever had one jab. i don t volunteer any additional info ever.
abusive...what a joke.  i m guessing she s on a blacklist just as we all probably are just for watching these  conspiracists .
@johnpruett5258  really sad when we can t exercise our right to free speech.
me too. i tell all the nosie rosies yes they  and i  are jabbed but we arent. god forgive me for fibbing but i see it as a form of self defense at this point.
@monicak100  hey  abraham said sarah was his sister for fear of his life.....sometimes we have to improvise.
excellent advice  well said  well spoken and well presented many thanks from a mother who is fighting for my kids futures  their health and their lives as they should be-with freedom and liberty and justice for all.
thank you.  after all these years  you have validated what i ve known for years.  only i know how my body reacts and functions.  i only seek medical intervention when necessary.
100  correct on everything you ve just said about the sad and dangerous state of today s medical care---thank you for your words of wisdom  they re sure to save some from undergoing much avoidable pain.
why can we not have more medical professionals like you  there is so little to trust in conventional care  and such limited availability of credible alternative care  i fear there are far too many ending up suffering and dying from lack of care - choosing instead to avoid risk of confrontation and struggling through on their own. god help us - only he can!!
i was a college athlete i had several injuries then and the nurses and doctors seemed arrogant and sarcastic.that was 40 years ago and nothing has changed. i stay away from anything medical unless it s unavoidable.i had a family doctor but it seemed he always wanted to write   a prescription for everything.the system is broken and i decided to take care of my own health. stay in shapeavoid doing risky activitieskeep a stock of supplies on hand.
my ancestors on ohio farms in the 1800s all lived into their 90s
shalom and keep speaking out against these horrific injustices and manipulations.
thank you  patriot nurse!  i do exactly what you said when going to these hospitals and doctors  offices.  i had to have knee surgery and i was very worried.  especially since there was a sign on the hospital grass promoting the  i said  yes i m vaccinated for sure!  not a lie  i have had many vaccines during my 55 years.  i m happy to say i did fine and had no problems.
i am coughing up green and yellow stuff. i am going to get a cat scan this month to see why this has been going on for a year now. i am afraid they will put me on a medication that is not helpful or good for me. i got my medical records from my neurologist recently only to see a ton of errors in their records and am shocked to see their  notes  about me which indicate that i am difficult and so on.  so let me get it straight  when they say  she has had ms since 2011   i was diagnosed in 2009  it is less important to get that straight and more important to say  she refused to lift her leg  because i can t do it. i have an infection which i saw noted in the doctors records back in april and they ask me how long i have had it even though they have known this since april. i am so so so disappointed but now fully awake to their ways!
the  medical industrial complex  is a home run!! love this channel thanks for sharing this valuable information!!
please look into taking christophers original formulas lung and bronchial herbal supplements and oregano oil capsules.
@isaac357mag  thank you!!!! god bless you!!!
@goinghome1191  and you as well!
try chopping up raw garlic and take about 1 4 a clove with lots of water. it s a natural antibiotic
@debihester7284  i totally agree
@debihester7284  thanks!
thank you   god bless you patriot nurse  your work is incredibly  appreciated.
thank you for your time in sharing this information...i personally don t believe in the medical field..i know how to keep myself healthy and i trust myself .
pn  thank you for all you do  i m actually one of those that was duped into believing they knew what was best for me but now that s on me  can t change it. god bless you sweet lady!
i have even less trust in doctors than before the plandemic. saying you re waiting to see how effective  it   is is the best way to answer questions about  it.  stay under the radar. you are so right patriot nurse!!!
i m so glad i ve always intuitively known this  it s saved me a lot of grief. but most people don t want the responsibility of taking care of themselves.
my record vs myocarditis is 1-0. man i love being a pureblood!
glad to see and hear you again. thank god you are doing better.been working at a va hospital past 15 years  you are so right . things have changed so much  i want to get out of the field. not the patient care it once was.
wish i could make it to one of your classes.  sounds amazing.  keep up the great work!
well one thing s for sure  when the extraordinarily young nurse at the lions va in jersey asked me if i had gotten my vaccine  i said i don t feel like answering that question  she then became confrontational. maybe that s why i was isolated in a room for about 20 minutes.  good old retaliation drives the point home.
when i get asked that question i say  absolutely not and it s going to stay that way .   shocks some people  makes others happy lol
@earndoggy  you should have seen how angry i was when she asked me to give my entire social security number out loud while she compared it to what was on the paper.i put in a complaint with patient advocacy. but anyway...
@matthewimi  i m glad you put in a complaint.   asking you to say it out loud is ridiculous!
ma asked  are you v ed   no.  are you going to get v ed  no  is that a good thing or a bad thing  i quickly asked  i do not know  we had to take it.  was her reply.
i lie to them and very sweetly tell them yes i had all. they don t bother me anymore.
i am more thankful than ever for the m.d. that i have after listening to this podcast and reading some of the comments.  the nurses that i have as well.
thank you patriot nurse  much wisdom you have.  i wonder why no doctors want to suggest life style changes to treat conditions.  the go to treatment is always a pill or surgery.  i told a doc i looked at some teas that could help clear lungs and she just gave me the blown tire sound.  we are a fat junk food nation and i know exercise and better diet is our best defense but it s not even up for discussion in a doctor s office these days  very sad.  she really blew a tire when i said i think some doctors get kick backs for pushing certain medications.  thank you for adding sense to the nonsense world of the medical community.  god bless!
thank you for being a voice for the people. i always learn something from you.
happened to my father related to cancer procedure. thanks for your content and passion.
hello from wyoming. i love the information you share. thank you for all you do.
thank you!  for validating the spidey feeling of the medical situation today!   i was actually told by a clinic that they described those who came thru their doors as  clients  instead of  patients  and proceeded to behave as such!   god bless you in all you do!
the idea of ending up in a canadian hospital is terrifying to me.
same in dentist offices  i ve had a terrible dental hygienist. also colon checks. one man woke up with a bandage on deltoid. someone became overzealous   gave him the so-called vax without his consent.
i know  right  did you hear about the young mother that died in excruciating pain while basically being ignored at an er in ns  so sad.
btw  i m in the us and it s not much better
in my 10 years experience with the medical field i have met 1 genuine caring doctor. she was truly a wonderful person first then a doctor. she saved my wife s life because she carded and wanted to figure out what was wrong with her. the rest thought my wife wanted more meds. even though i sat there all but shouting we don t want more pills we want help!!  p.s  thanks for all you do lady your amazing you know
i had not had an annual exam in two years because of lack of insurance. i finally have benefits  so i had my appointment recently and got results stating that  my test could not be read.  that is the first time that ever happened  i am middle-aged   and of course  instead of saying that it may have been a collection error on their part  and offer to cover the expense  they then want me to come in again in three months so they can charge me outright  as it will not be covered under the annual examination  it will be considered a follow-up appointment at full cost. i wonder what percentage of tests  cannot be read  so that they can get more money out of patients. i have a high-deductible plan  and all appointments are at full cost until the deductible is met. honestly  i am so sick of dealing with the medical system that it may be a condition unto itself -  acute medical-industrial complex dysphoria.
there is a great documentary series from 1975 titled connections and in one episode it showed how the medical system went from the patient telling the doctor what was wrong  to the patient giving up that authority to the so called expert because of the vast knowledge we have made over the last 100 years.
i caught that thing  like 3 weeks ago  and i had it for like 12 days.  it was really mild though.  i have postnasal drip anyways  so i took my flonase and i got over it.  also  i m on psych meds.  and i almost got off schedule because i couldn t go to the lab to get lab work.  because of one of my medications  i have to get lab work before they mail my medication.  so  i asked my nurse what to do.  i ended up asking for an extension.  i didn t even know you could do that.
i totally agree with everything you have said. unfortunately when i did this  some .e.r. doctor listed me right on my medical chart as a  difficult patient  for everyone to see! now whenever i go to see anybody it s the first thing i am confront ed with before anything! if i can ever find out who did this i intend to bring a defamation law suit against them! it s been a nightmare for me ever since he did this!
when i was in my early 30 s my dr diagnosed me with hypertension.  he gave me a script for some medication that blocked the release of adrenaline  but not the production of it.  it worked for about a year and then my b p went up.  he told me double the dosage which i did and i came back in a week and it had gone higher.  he told me that i wasn t taking the medication as he told me to.  he told me to tripple the dosage and i fired him on the spot.  i think everyone in the office heard me.  i found another dr. and he was fantastic.  he got my b p well regulated.  sometime later i was at the pharmacy and i told the pharmacist what had happened and she told me it happened to her too.  after a while the medicine quit working and all that stored up adrenaline was dumped into our systems.
thank you. this is the basis of what everyone used to know but has been lost. too many people will be permanently harmed going into the future. we have to protect ourselves   children. it s a different world now
retired rn here and you are absolutely spot on.  thank you  i am changing my diet and off all of my meds but one.  working on how to get off that med once i find an alternative.  keep going girl!!  sadly i lost my brother in law this week after a booster  he and his wife wouldn t listen to me about the risk involved.
thank you!  thank you for speaking.  this is one of those topics where hitting that thumbs up is in agreement vs liking it.  i m in agreement with everything in this video.  i ve had issues with the med field since my daughter was born 21 yrs ago.  tough considering i have family who work in the field.  but i hold my ground and do not subscribe to anything without unbiased proof.  difficult but i m honest enough with myself to know when i need treatment and know when i can use homeopathy naturopathy and luckily have a spouse who doesn t give me grief.   d
thank you for this patriot nurse.  it s perfect timing as i m about to have an appt. with a new doctor today.  i m fully awake and fed up  but i ll try to reign it in.  that s very good advice. blessings and happy new year!
retired cna here and planning on doing the same thing here - will be working to get off as many meds as possible this year.
what did your brother-in-law die of  if i may ask
@whatsup848  he had a massive mi  no history of cardiac issues.  he did have a pe with his 1st and a tia with his 2nd.  so  we kind of knew this was a potential outcome.
@pinkadink1954  oh my goodness.  my mil felt odd as soon as she got her first booster.  within a week she was admitted for atrial fib that she will need meds.
@whatsup848  so sorry  i wish they would have listen to the warning. but he believed the doc saying   it was safe and effective  .
thank you for your time in making this video my family and i are definitely going through this.  and i will as continue to follow my gut instincts.
i flunked  i had a discussion with my dr about the jab and she was not happy with me. but we did come to a neutral agreement. but now i  see that i m treated differently that i have noticed. but i do believe that healthcare is turning their backs on our society. they are all in big pharmas pockets. thank you.
please do more of these videos that will help us  especially us parents  navigate this new system.
i was pharma-injured in 2019 with doctor prescribed ativan  remeron and prednisone  for an autoimmune   hellish withdrawal sx and adrenal insufficiency. i m thankful that i at least got to know the true nature of our medical system  and it s sadistic use of pharmaceuticals before the experiment was pushed on all of us. i rejected it and kept my job in healthcare. i m very happy with my decision!
follow up comment -- he was super kind and accommodating about my issue with not being able to wear the face diaper and the hokey-pokey didn t even come up.
thank you patriot nurse! always a wealth of knowledge.
you are a breath of fresh air nurse. i have followed my intuition and holy spirit for a long time. because i listened  my son was a newborn lived. my dad had a medical procedure at the hospital and was released and i knew something was wrong so stayed the night with him. he was rushed back to hospital by ambulance 4 hours later. if i did what the doctor said i would have buried my son and dad years ago....
great video.    my dr has definitely changed how we interact since covid.  not feeling very comfortable or assured with her patient dedication.   very pushy when it comes to the jab and i m not having any of it.  looking for a new dr who will join in a partnership with me on my health.  thanks for all you do patriot nurse.  guess i just needed to hear this affirmation today.  blessings
your approach is so enlightening resolving internal conflict if remembered to real time situations -love it!  shabat shalom
i certainly don t do it as well as patriot nurse  but i ve been reminding friends and family for decades that when it all comes down to it  we are customers! we have every right to ask questions  decline treatment  make requests and with hold information we don t wish to share. respecting the health care provider in the process  even if you disagree with them  goes without saying for mature adults. a good doctor is like a good mechanic. i ve been blessed to have both most of my adult life  but it seems they are fewer and farther between than in my early life.
patriot nurse....thank you so much for this video! i hope and pray that everyone who watched this video  received your message from a spiritual perspective and understood that god has given them a discernment of what is worldly and what is godly. following the system   like sheep  is not only harmful  but could easily lead to destruction  vs. following what we feel is right in our hearts   god given  is what we as a chosen people should  feel  listen too  and desire for . it is not always easy to separate ourselves from family  friends  co-workers  loved ones   but if we feel that something isn t right  we need the courage to make a stand and hold fast to our beliefs and feelings. i really enjoy  appreciate  and respect the message that you bring to your videos  and i hope and pray that everyone receives them the same way you feel when recording them. please keep up the  good work  and the faith to bring the truth to light..... until we meet one day soon!
i thank the lord for patriot nurse may he empower many more patriot nurses around the globe
thank you so much for another thought provoking video. i always walk away with knowledge or greater understanding after studying your work.
you are brilliant. thank you for getting true knowledge out to the public
very good video  very good advice. i rarely go to a doctor  but when i go  i go armed with as much data as i can gather - body temperature taken at least 3x day  notes on urination frequency etc.  any easily gathered data. the objective is not to tell them what they should do  but to demonstrate that i am paying attention.  beyond which i follow your advice of being very pleasantly neutral and non-committed.  i have great praise for any doctor  they spent a lot of time  effort  and money to get to where they are  and they know the medicines and procedures far better than i do but.. i m in my body 24 7  and that s where my expertise rests. so  as you say  i m gathering information and evaluating  and if there s that attitude you mentioned  i ll get back to them when things are ready for the decision they want. it s easier to be vague and drift by if it doesn t feel right  than it is to go in as an adversary  but we also need to be able to quietly walk out if that s what our gut tells us to do.
message of courage. great teacher.
thanks and blessings dear patriot nurse!  my gp and my cardiologist were both sternly pushing me to get jabbed  and the gp somewhat backed down over time...... i did not get jabbed.  praised be you lord jesus christ... hallelujah!
i had a doctor give me a  popular  diagnosis of covid  instead of a  real  diagnosis of lymes from a different doctor.
this was exactly my experience yesterday when i went to see a new primary care physician  so that i could get a referral for an ultrasound. she was very pushy  insisting that i get procedures that i don t need  mammogram  full blood work up . she tried so hard  to scare me with the worst possible outcomes  if i didn t do these procedures. oh brother. i expected that  going in. and so  i wasn t surprised at all. i just politely stood my ground. i learned a long time ago  how to be my own advocate. i d bet that oftentimes  we consumers know far more than the white coats.
this is probably the best video i have ever seen on yt. your honesty and practical outlook is so refreshing. being retired i see lots of commercials on pharma. where side effects on something to clear up skin conditions might include death. how can a dr. prescribe something so potentially dangerous and be able to sleep at night. and pharma can t keep up with antibiotic production  all companies are entitled to make a good profit but that seems to be pharma s. only concern  not curing and healing.
helpful info  thank you. i have an issue. i m almost 65 years old and i ve had lupus and degenerative disc disease for a good twenty years and i usually go to the er a couple times a year with a severe flare up or when i ve blown another disc. i think i ve become labeled a drug seeker for that  even though some visits it s not pain i m there for but other lupus complications. that has made getting good medical care in general very difficult for me. but now  when i go to the er there s a suspected attitude from some medical staff that s different and i think the difference is i haven t gotten the jab. my last er visit was over a year ago. i m afraid to go back so when i should be seeing someone immediately  i lay on my sofa and ride it out. the last er visit they were going to do the nasal swab and i agreed but said i do have severe allergic rhinitis so i hoped she d go easy but she stuck the swab so far up and moved it around for at least five seconds in each nasal cavity and the swabs were blood tinged. it hurt so bad i was screaming and i never do that. i try not to draw attention to myself. it went on so long another nurse actually ran into the room. of course  the acting nurse stopped right away. i m convinced she was torturing me cuz i didn t have the jab. and when i was then hospitalized for a blood clot  a phlebotomist came in about 3am for a blood draw. when she inserted the needle she rammed it. and i do mean rammed. no blood draw has ever been that painful. i had the worst hematoma from it. i never get hematomas. i believe they were professionals who have attitudes toward those of us who are....holding out for more data on the subject. now i believe i m having a heart issue but i m afraid to go to the doctor  much less  the er. i have a feeling this is going to cost me and my family. edited  i forgot to mention  i have 20 years  12 hours a day medical experience and i know a lot more than i let on at the er. i know some of the things they do are not what i d do as a professional. the difference in medial now and when i worked it feels so different.
patriot nurse proves intelligent woman are simply the best   she s awesome
total agree . i went to see new doctor   because i didn t agree with getting the normal life test  he asked me how long do you want to live  i told him when the good lord call me home. basically  he was telling me  if i don t get the normally yearly test that a women over 50 would get i was going to die sooner then someone that has these test ever year.  i was there because i have a pain in my stomach and he said because it doesn t hinder my daily life i should just live with it...really .. my chiropractor is is the only doctor i trust . he told me what was wrong with my stomach .
truth belongs to friends  not enemies.
i m 76 and go to the dr. once a year with a list of the blood tests i want. my weight  blood pressure  etc. are perfect. they send me the test results and i take natural herbs  vitamins accordingly. either grown in my herb garden or from a reputable natural medicine store. i also take raw thyroid capsules from new zealand cattle. i have asthma  but control it with mullein and other respiratory herbs. no vaccines since i was a teenager.
because i was so poor after my military service and disabled i couldn t even afford medical care which i thank the lord because this prepared me for today when we get no medical care. i miss nothing!
great advice! i know i have a wonderful doctor ... he never pressures about anything. we are always able to discuss everything and i m always allowed to say  no  without him getting mad. however  we do tease each other about getting old
you are correct and i tell people all the time to trust their gut  listen to their intuition. i need to follow suit  my gut is telling me i need to leave this crazy allopathic western medicine practice of nursing and go out on my own to be more holistic in helping others manage their health. most of us that are nurses are good nurses! i always want what s best for the patient and i believe in informed consent and patient autonomy to make the best decision for him her! but these past 3 years have been soooo crazy!! i stood my ground and was not mandated as a state employee! however i work for an agency that pushes the narrative to the public and our patients which is ironic because that narrative was one i didn t have to follow!
i very much followed my gut re  the jab  and i now feel very blessed that i did so. have not had the koof. i do take precautions. i m also blessed to have good doctors who accept that i do trust my gut and stay very well informed. they have seen me through a decade of ra that i am treating herbally  and a few days ago when i saw my rheumatologist she said   wow  you look great! keep doing what you re doing!
the gray man principles apply in every stressful situation.
my wife is pregnant.  we went into the hospital for our first visit  midwives and nurses  no doctors .  when we got to the counter to check-in they told us to put on masks.  my wife put it on and i told them i was allergic.  about 20 minutes after we were taken back and did the ultrasound a front desk person found me and gave me an n-95.  i just put it in my pocket.  i knew this didn t sit well with some of the staff  but our midwife was very friendly.  i feel like based on what you said how you should just nod your head and say  safe and effective...    that they will know by default if i don t have a bacteria muzzle on.  i don t want to put my wife and unborn child in the crosshairs.  what should i do on the next visit  on the bright side the majority of other patients either had their noses exposed or straight up chin diapers so anybody who isn t a npc can see it s just a virtue signal.
god bless you patriot nurse and greetings from canada.  your information regarding conversation is so helpful to me.  i can t get past my derision towards all of these institutions and find  it difficult to communicate.  have you seen what s going on with jordan peterson!  god bless you!  without my intense faith in jesus and the gift of grace  i would feel completely hopeless.  i really appreciate your eloquence and common sense.  thank you very much.
i have a suggestion for you...first i agree with not wearing the mask  a bunch of nonsense. my suggestion is on future visits if you get told that you will absolutely have to wear your mask in order to be allowed back to the exam room with your wife  just quietly put it on   wear the top beneath your nose in order to breathe decently. i am finding that within certain environments it is best to go along with the nonsense to a point in order to get the end goal done  which in your case is to be there   support your pregnant wife. by the way congratulations on your baby. may you   your wife enjoy being parents.
@amycopeland1701  thank you for the suggestion.  i may have to do that.  it really is sad we ve entered a time where i m just as nervous to go to a hospital as i am during an encounter with a cop.
@amycopeland1701  here s what i did. instead of fashioning the top wire around your nose  which i found to fog up my glasses  i keep it as wide as possible to let my exhale out the sides. that satisfies the mask nazis and let s you breathe. letting your nose stick out will still get you yelled at....
i used a shield never a mask.. was only denied entrance to one place of business.  refused to go in and have never been back.
god bless you!! you are completely 100  correct!! i had   pardon the vernacular but it is the best description for this doctor and i use that term loosely.  a run-in with an ass hat that called himself a doctor. he was always bullying and abusive. this wasn t the first time i ve had a run in with him as i was a patient on his floor for a few days i broke my femur february 2021. went back into the hospital in august 2021 and refusing to get that poison injected into myself got a little dicey at times. most of the staff in that hospital were 100  in agreement and supportive but again this guy was not. and he wanted me to go to a nursing home and i said no because they want you to take that poison and i m not going to do it. he started screaming at me and he was red in the face and he was telling me that it s people like me that caused the spread. i  looked at him and calmly said no it s the people that are getting that poison that s causing the spread. oh heathrow right tantrum. i reported him to the hospital administration. i d say i won that round perhaps. hospital ministration be more than happy to take my statement. i m not the only one that has the opinion of him that i do the staff does as well. he should not be over an entire rehabilitational ward but he is. thank you for all your wonderful information and insight. i am happy to say that i have been in tune with this the entire time and it has served me well. most of my friends and family feel the same. we lost a few because they didn t listen sad to say. but again god bless you and thank you for all that you do and your words of wisdom. please keep up the good work. i hope you have a wonderful new year!!
i had a dermatologist with whom i had to use some of the responses you suggested until it got to the point where she got very specific about the situation that had nothing to do with my skin.  i tried the tactic of responding with nods   uh huh s and it didn t end well. needless to say  i didn t make another appointment with her.
very well said  i would only add that the pharmaceutical companies spend a lot of money on lobbiests to make sure that all the dr.s see things their way when it comes to vaccines and medications.
before the big event i was seeing a doctor and they kept trying to take my blood every time i came in they took my blood i made them stop told him that they weren t going to take my blood anymore and that nurse looked at me all weird there s no reason for that i haven t been back since and i m perfectly healthy
thanks for sharing this information  i have been thinking about this situation for a while. we are looking for changes in our health care!
thank you for your work. you present information in an excellent  easy to understand way.
excellent thank you for sharing the intimate knowledge of how healthcare works.
whenever anyone was sick or injured in my family  my father would take the merck manual down from the shelve and look up the symptoms  come up with a diagnosis and prescribe treatment. it never crossed our minds to rush out to a hospital.
thank you  you have hit the nail on the head! i concur that  they  simply want  submission  for their  bottom line . no empathy  genuine sense of caring for the individual  no hippocratic oath adherence.
at 72 i have used traditional chinese medicine for the past 27 years for all of my health needs. it is very safe and effective.
i listened to my gut and did not take any of these experimental jabs.  i had to make sacrifices and give up relationships  but i know that i know that i did the right thing by listening to my gut.
i justed to say thank you for your service as a nurse. also your common sense and your desire to do what is right. god bless. keep fighting the good fight
my goal is to be free of pharmaceutical dependency as i age. most people my age are on 3 or more meds. i use food  mindful exercise  fresh air  rest  and natural supplements to optimize my health.
she is so on point here!  you are a billing potential commodity to that provider.  a new np got angry with me because i went to interview her as i had moved and she wanted to do blood work.  no. zero needles  first and no scripts to be written. her office called me and said they could not bill for the session as no consult had been ordered  no referral showing chain of custody on me.  can i come do blood work so they can bill.  no. i may not have a medical provider at this point.  interesting.
it s all very weird!  consultations were once common.  that would be a  conversation .  there used to be compensations for consultations  just as there are for lawyers  if they choose.
our  empathic intuitive  side has absolutely been silenced  for specific and practical reasons.remember  that  still  small voice  speaks to us from a place that is directly in opposition to what the propagandists  such as bernays  and the cacophonous popular culture is blaring at us. cheers  and thanks for all you do!
the timing of this video is good. i have an appointment coming up  and last time they said i was just over prediabetic. i am going to tell them i don t want to use metformin.. my aproach is  to use  whole food as medicine. i know diabeties 2 is reversable naturally.
five yrs ago i went to the er by myself in a cab due to what turned out to be a severe vertigo   migraine attack. the intake nurse was great  but the er nurses were less than wonderful. numerous things went wrong while in the er. yet  my hope was that after receiving iv hydration and something for migraine pain i d be able to go home. the er doctor was concerned about sending me home alone   suggested i stay overnight and have some additional tests in the morning. i reluctantly agreed. within 20 minutes of being admitted to my room  a respiratory therapist came in to give me a treatment for what she called my  asthma attack.  i wasn t having an asthma attack. after the poor treatment in the er  this was a red flag for me and i refused a treatment i didn t need. that is when i learned i was not to question any health professional. i decided i had enough and decided to leave. i was told i couldn t leave because the hospitalist who admitted me had already left for the day. i asked for another hospitalist to discharge me. i was informed only the admitting hospitalist could do that. i challenged what i was told because hospitalists don t always work on the day a patient is to be discharged whether due to shift schedules  vacations  their own illness  etc. the nurse then told me if i left on my own  it would be recorded in my chart and my insurance company would not pay for any part of my er visit or short time in my hospital room. at the time  i didn t know this was false information and totally unethical. i pressed the nurse to get the hospitalist on the phone  which she finally did  and i received my discharge paperwork. however  the hospitalist first told me that she didn t want to discharge me because i could sue her if something happened when i got home. so  i could be mistreated in the er and given the wrong treatment in the hospital  but her biggest concern was about being sued...not my welfare. within a month  i received an  invitation  from a company called rti to participate in a survey about mental health. it promised that i would be paid  30 for my information if i was chosen to go onto the next level of questioning. my personal information is my own  and i don t sell my soul for any amount. i ignored the repeated mailings from rti reminding me i hadn t yet completed their survey. after 2 months  their mailings finally stopped. i researched rti and discovered the us government has been using them for decades to obtain updated information about mental health from us citizens. turns out it also has ties to the cdc   rti international researchers are working to establish a surveillance system for assessment of public health threats.  could it be that i m a public health threat because i listened to my own intuition  i commented on and questioned the behaviors of staff that felt so out of alignment with my own internal knowing  so i am now labeled as non-compliant. my er visit 5 yrs ago totally changed the way i looked at the healthcare industry. it shattered a trust that turns out was only an illusion anyway. but  it did prepare me for what was to come a year later.
for most things i agree.  i made a wrong decision one time and almost lost our daughter.  she woke up unwell one january day with a fever  she was 16  and i treated her for flu. later in the evening she started vomiting   her fever returned higher   we rushed her to the hospital when she started passing out.  it was toxic shock syndrome.  it wasn t related to tampons.  she spent 2 days in icu.
thanks so much for your insights! you re always very helpful. do you have any tips for women navigating reproductive health in this ridiculous medical atmosphere  after many years of being ignored about heavy bleeding for 6 years  i finally got diagnosed with uterine fibroids in 2015. i was told they were calcified and not active. only to have my periods get worse and worse up until  today when i ve been through 6 gynecologists!!! four weren t helpful and 1 was good but too far away and the one i chose is very helpful and close enough. this doctor i m seeing now is recommending a myomectomy to remove one of the fibroids  which are big and it s located outside of my uterus pressing against my rectum  which has been miserable. this doctor is reasonable and i trust him so far. i m most likely going to get the myomectomy after my next appointment with him. any tips also how to recover well during the two weeks of recovery time
you didn t make a wrong decision. you made a normal mom decision. we ve all had those happen. thank god you made another mom decision and took her in when you did.
1  avoid the system unless it s life or death2  be assertive. refuse to be bullied and be prepared to set limits. leave if they get disrespectful.3  take advocates with you  and get them involved. if you re impaired enough to risk engaging with the system  you will  at some point  be unable to look out for yourself.4  be ready to leave at any time. that is your only real power. if they won t provide the care you need  or they expect unreasonable concessions  seek help elsewhere.
saying yes we are up to date has never not one time worked for me. they stop look at me and ask again. so i just say  we don t   very matter of factly  and they say  ok  moving on .i went in for an induction at 42 weeks  and they ran a quickie hiv test and came back and told me i was positive. after a quick discussion with my husband  we got up and left. the interventions they were about to start would have been so detrimental to my health and the baby s health. we had been to the rodeo enough to know when to jump ship. if i had delivered that baby in that hospital  i would have lost the ability to protect him  so i left. the long test came back negative  and they never bothered to let me know. i had to request the hospital records. shows how much they believed the bull they were feeding me. trust your gut!
so glad your feeling better and back 8n the fight.
thank you for this excellent video. i have definitely encountered this and am in search of a doctor who shares my views  at least somewhat. my  primary care doc treats me as if i don t have a brain and can t think for myself. during the height of the craziness  i asked her if she would give me a prescription for two drugs that had been proven to be very effective against a certain virus. she scoffed and said   sure. when you move to africa and come down with malaria.  i said   i take it that s a no.  and of course  she s always pushing me to get all the unnecessary and experimental jabs. i ended up buying the medicines online from a pharmacy in india  but we shouldn t have to resort to such measures! i was really glad to find your video today and to hear your take on this.
excellent video!!!there s no substitute for intelligence  and you have it in spades!blessings
tell  em  patriot nurse! i have lots of stories. you speak truth. living holistically and by the holy spirit is the only way! gosh  i love you. thank you so much for your godly sisterhood  wisdom  and valuable teachings. you re truly one in a million!
great video content here!!! 35 years ago my children s doctor was pushing for my kids to do the multivitamins with floride. i did just as you suggested here. i just shook my head yes knowing full well that wouldn t be happening.
it is so reassuring to hear you tell it like it is!!bless you
absolutely. i totally agree!
yes you are right. i was hit by some one texting and driving.  my chiropractor sent me to a pain management center.  i mostly went to get physical therapy. this doctor told me to file for disability.  he wanted to give me injections into my spine. i didn t go along with this. i told him i wanted to wait until i had no hope. during my office visit i had a conversation with him ....i was concerned that all the farm work was now going to be on my husband because i could no longer help.  this doctor then wanted to put me on pain meds that were addictive and had side effects of suicidal thought and tendencies. he got upset when i told him i didn t need to deal with addiction nor could i risk this dangerous side effect.  he kept pushing me why i was so adamant....i said i carry a firearm....i have to be more responsible.  i also know they can revoke your 2 a for such things. he then told the judge on my disability that i was helping my husband on our farm. so i was denied disability.  this is pure evil. now i have no income.  the nurse who hit me was a former drunk driver who got her license back  criminal driving history . i has to file for underinsured for the lousy  100 000 which didn t pay for 2 years off work let alone the rest of my life....and the expenses i still have with therapy.  i really needed my disability.  if this doctor told me to file for disability....if i didn t really need it lol....why prescribe me injections in my spine and addictive drugs. you can t make this up!!!! i have had other experiences with courts and custody evaluators trying to rescue my granddaughter who we raised for 5 years.....they don t like it when you don t vaccinate  home school  eat healthy and have religious beliefs.  custody evaluator just made up complete lies of which my attorney had to impeach her for....and yes we proved she made it all up. we proved she didn t follow one guideline. we proved she worked backwards on the report.  this case involved medical neglect   not feeding her  molestation while in my daughters care  and a fraudulent adoption. firearm were being left out of which were loaded and in her reach. my daughter s new husband who fraudulently adopted her spent 4 days in a psych ward for pulling an ak47 on some one while intoxicated.  he still has a license btw. the custody evaluator testified in court... well he said he was sorry.  this guy had a file 3 inches thick. drugs  alcohol  statutory rape and anger management issues.  the judge kept the report anyway... because they can. they left my most precious gift in the hands of monsters.  she was 5 last time i saw her. she it s been 10 years now. i don t know where or how she is...or what has happened to her. the beast system....scripture defines it properly.  i try to warn people but i think it is hard for good people to comprehend evil concepts.  creator has opened my eyes.  you better try your very best not to be dependent on the beast system. amein and amein.
thanks. been fighting to get a doctor any doctor to run tests and not just make assumptions about me. last week i finally succeeded. i got a phone call today with the results of those tests. it was very bad news that would have been beneficial to know years ago
thank you for your expertise and care about people  no matter what they believe.
i call it the  medical merry-go-round . at 72 i am thankful to have gotten off of it years ago. i do not take prescription drugs. years ago my now deceased husband and i went to the same doctor. he did routine blood tests on me and when the results came back he rolled up his little medical stool  looked at me face to face and said    you are a walking time bomb for a heart attack or stroke!  he said i needed to get on cholesterol drugs immediately. he sent samples home with me to get me started. i could not take them. my god given intuition told me better. my husband  on the other hand did take them  along with a list of other meds that the doctor referred to as a  medical cocktail ! this mammon serving system is evil.
some doctors get very offended when i tell them that i hired them to give me the best advice they have available but that all final decisions are mine to make. i have had serious problems with incompetent and outdated physicians. i have learned the hard way and i also have several sets of letters after my name so i am not ignorant nor nearly as gullible as i once was.
woman   patriot of the decade in my book.
referring to the garden of eden is a great reference point.  i find myself doing that often  it answers many of my questions about why things are the way they are.
probably the best medical advice i have heard in years.
i went into emergency last month because i thought i was having a stroke. turned out to be a possible migraine that caused stroke symptoms. sadly  that migraine cost me  14 000. i might actually have a real stroke over this. our healthcare system is such a nightmare.
great job again! i ll keep you in my prayers each and every day! keep up the great work!
girl!!! where was this video when my mom was sick!! i didn t trust the doctor and the  co-poa  she set up  friend of the family  said i was wrong!! i was the other poa  to long of a story to tell on here  but she died in 2017. anyway  thank-you for what you are doing!!! please come to ne ohio! ! !
much respects to you patriot nurse   northern new mexico
it s not just the virus. it s all things medical!! you must protect yourself  or be an advocate for a loved one who isn t capable of taking care of themselves.
keep on keeping on!from greg  kelly and kaci  here in central north carolina  we love you  and appreciate you pn .god bless.
also love pn.  also in north nm.
if i ever need to go to the doctor i would hope where i go there is a nurse there with your great guidance!!!  i pray i never have to but if i do hopefully god will send your wisdom to me so i can make the right decisions!!  i would like too thank you for everything    stay safe and strong  patriot nurse my god bless you and your channel!!!!
thank you so much for the info. my bf fell last july had neck surgery  in oct 22 and now waiting  for shoulder surgery and maybe carpal tunnel  unless that is coming from a bad neck surgery.  this info was very helpful
i was always pro jab  until it happened to my wife and myself. we were told   do it for everybody else   and that it would make being infected less serious. having been on a vent for 10 days  because i refused to rest when i had it  i called it a common cold  spouted all the tinfoil hat rhetoric  and almost died  despite being the same height  weight and body fat as tom brady. zero co morbidity s. i was turned pro jab because of my own stupidity when dealing with my own illness.  if you had the original 1-2 variants  rest combined with respiratory therapy excercises was very important. instead  i decided to build 2 farm planters from bare bars. after the jab  and going back to flying after a paid leave  i started getting chest pains at altitude. i was dissolving aspirin under my tongue  and shortly came to the conclusion that i can t be flying aircraft in that condition. on my 2nd to last flight  my 1st officer was experiencing the same symptoms.until that day  i chalked it up to the fact that i m getting older.  through out my entire life  i never had  a  job  always had many irons in the fire. it was just time to choose between farming and flying.  since the farm is my legacy and my children s future  the choice was obvious.i m talking with many other aviators who are going through the same thing. at altitude  they just aren t  right.  chest pains  sometimes it shoots down the arm  shortness of breath. several have been really close to declaring themselves incapacitated and forcing a landing. we ve had a record number of pilots die in flight since the jab. it s confusing  we ve had a record number die on the ground on and off duty as well. i went from having the cardio vascular system of a 19 year old  a healthy 19 year old  not a pepsi and dorito commando  to my present state in 2 years.my wife has been diagnosed with ms  als  to the doctors throwing up their hands and saying they can t pin point what is wrong with her.  her body quit telling her muscles to breathe once  she was rushed away on a life flight. she is a beautiful  vibrant woman who has born 7 children. it takes about 2 hrs of stretching and yoga for her to remain ambulatory each day.  she carrie s a rescue respirator that she can utilize and sleeps with a cpap now. i don t know what is wrong. i m on an unpaid leave right now  listing my wife as the reason. but i m passing my physicals for a 1st class medical certificate. i probably will continue to do so unless they decide to make us get in a lower pressure vessel like  nasa requires. just my 2 cents. this thing is a mess. what is happening to people might be due to covid itself  not the jab  but we were lied to about what the jab is  what it does  and why we should get it.
wyoming fan here. discernment is key.
it is a classic fallacy of our time that a moron run through a university and decorated with a ph.d. will thereby cease to be a moron.    h. l. mencken.    keep up your fight patriot nurse  for individual agency.
our local  small town  hospital has bought up all the local independent doctor s offices in our area.  from what i understand  they pressured the doctors facilities into selling by threatening to restrict access to the hospital facility resources.  so basically  any doctor you see within a 30-mile radius is owned by the same parent entity.  now  this parent entity dictates policy across all satellite offices.  the local  formerly independent  doctors are now subject to the main hospitals operating structure.  all competition has been removed.  if you are unhappy with anything  tuff.  our only alternative is to travel to another region  that may or may not be subject to the same situation.
yes listen to your gut!  most rn s i use to work with all listened to their guts. best rn s
always.
whoaaaa...this is truly scary!!!!!!   thank you for enlightening us  i had no idea!
yes. i am current on all of those things. love that bit of wisdom.
this is such important info!! ive already had  the conversation  w my  well-known  well respected in the medical community  hematologist that i have done my research and the jury is still out  so i havent taken the jab. he said  at your age 66  you really should get it  for your protection.   yeah  right . i limit my exposure to his office  but am looking for alternatives to the expensive medication blood thinner  i have to take. any ideas
t. nattokinase
truer words were never spoken! thank you
doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little  to cure diseases of which they know less  in human beings of whom they know nothing.  - voltaire
you put a smile on my face and made me snicker when you said  knee-high to a grasshopper !  while i occasionally use the saying myself  it s been quite a while since i ve heard anyone else say it.  keep up the great work!and  if you don t mind my saying so  you look very beautiful with the dress you are wearing!  actually  you look very ravishing and radiant!  take care of yourself and be safe!may god bless!
one can also fire the doctor or nurse treating you. you are hiring them for a service. a lot of which direction to fire a ego tripping person or the other route like patriot nurse give.  it would be nice to have a doctor who is like minded.  very good points you bring out thank you so much
at this point  i see medical professionals as my gateway to tests and treatments i cannot otherwise access and little else. they are not my first inquiry unless it s life-threatening or broken.
any time i resist a med or a test  the doc makes a point of writing it down in a chart and i am treated like a naughty child.  lol
i always consider  regarding the medical entities someone had to graduate med school at the very bottom of their class... the cut off point.they re out there...
i ve never got a flu shot in my life never. not gonna get the jab either. if they try to force me to do something against my will i will resist. it wasn t forced on me but was encouraged. my gf is a dentist and the health board made them get it or they couldn t practice. she s fine though. don t seem to have any negative affects on her. glad to have her.
thank you. pertinent information. concise and clear. thank you for your voice on these issues.
my mom went to a doctor that would have had her crapping in a bag for the rest of her life. she called me from the hospital begging me to get her out of there. she was freaking out. of course i hauled ass over there. ready to crush skulls. went to another doctor  told her to avoid certain foods and gave her some meds. this was 6 years ago and hasn t had another problem. that doctor was soon forced to quit after multiple complaints against him.
hi   i m so happy to hear this.  here s my situation   i ve had fibroids for 20 years and i only went to the doctor because the tumors were visible on an mri for my hip.   i had totally forgotten i had them anyway went to gyn. after the tests she sent me for she then said   i need a hysterectomy .  my gut said no   i have zero symptoms .  i am afraid to have this surgery   i m seeing my primary on the 13th to get her opinion.  thanks for the information video.
i have proven alot of doctor s wrong. even  if i had to be a  witch. it s funny  i always tell the doctor s what i need  and all they have to do is write the prescription on the pad.heck  if i had the  pad  i could take care of myself.doctor s and nurse s alike have a  god  mentality.
you are awesome! i wish i could afford your class. i don t go to the dr anymore. i don t trust the ones in my area.
best medical advice! thanks patriot nurse and have a wonderful new year
thank you so much! so many of us are at loss in knowledge and strength when a medical situation happens so you trust the doctor. i wish i did things differently. my dad went to emergency for pneumonia and left in a body bag from  icu 10 days later from kidney failure. what does one have to do with the other  threy pumped him so full of meds that his kidneys failed and he had no pro lems with his kidneys before that. they also gave him a blood infection from banked blood when they denied my offer to transfuse from me.  i didnt know until after but my mom said when he first met the icu doctor   the doctor  told my dad he was   going to die  going to die  going to die.   if i knew that doc would mentally set him up for failure from the first moment that doctor was not on his side. i would have pulled him out and treated him with a homeopathic herbal protocol at home.
what she calls  intuition  is actually the influence from god that  when we live his laws  we can call upon him for guidance. i ve seen this many times in my life. and yes  it enables us to be warned of danger. it helps us know good from evil. and that includes recognizing people whose goal is not our good but their own.
definitely a new world. not one to which i am fond of. i do have two md s that understand my preferences  while the one in the big league of healthcare has changed over the last few years. not because his wanting to  but because of the pressure. sadly  changes from our choices are forth coming.
damn girl  you are spot-on with comment of edward bernays. it s all about  engineering consent . in his book he talks of being manipulated from being a citizen to a consumer mentality. one who has lost critical-thinking skills. book of proverbs states  the simple pass-on and are punished.
chinese medicine has 2000 years of records regarding the use of a particular plant  but modern  medicine  says it hasn t been studied in isolation  so it can t be determined to be  safe and effective .  what they mean is they haven t reduced it to its component parts so it can be mass manufactured for profit.
that s exactly what i do always listen and follow my intuition.  thank you !
nurseninja here  i love and have followed what you ve been doing!  i served 2 years of the pandemic in a covid overrun icu taking 4 1 patients who where highly unstable  proned  paralyzed  sedated  and on 5 titratable gtts.  every single one of them should have been 1 1 in icu.  i and many others refused the  safe and effective interventions  that you so eloquently discuss in your video.  i have seen intentional patient and staff harm based on the the g manipulation of the mic you referred to.  would love force multiply what you are doing.    god bless and stay strong sister!
as always   love the information and the fact you talk at a speed i like haha.  it is hard to listen to a person who can t find their words and take forever to make a point!  god bless you!
you are so on point. thank you for being vocal of the truth.
shalom pn  very good advice. spiddy senses kept me alive 33 years as a leo.
if i had listened to my intuition  my daughter would not have been brain damaged....
thank you for this. i m in the process of establishing a new primary provider and will use the tools you ve shared here.
absolute truth presented here.  and the same should apply toward all politicians government on every and all decisions that individuals are faced with.
honey  you must forgive yourself! god knows you would never hurt her on purpose. we all make mistakes
excellent. for everyone to be aware . the world has changed  post covid. you are 100  correct.  i am in the medical field.
i love your program very informational thank you for the do s and don ts in the way we should  conduct our interview with the medical field in general. i had a bad habit of treating my my doctor like a clergy
thank you! kalispell mt oncol gave me 4 wrong chemo for my stage grade c  over  190k. got my hands on the manufacturer letter  they denied the d  she knew entire time the treatment was not to manufacture specifications and gave it to me anyway. took her to the mt medical board and they sided with her. its way worse than what you re saying  you are very kind!
i lost all trust in the medical profession years ago.
i totally agree with you  you need to keep your head in a swivel so to speak. we wise and trust your intuition and avoid confrontation even when you re being offered a specific medical treatment. the western world is in a strange situation  you will need to trust in yourself and build a community of like minded people as alot of the institutions that people have put great faith in will ultimately crumble if they keep following the same trajectory
excellent topic miss patriot nurse.the younger the doctor the more they are cogs in the medical industrial complex wheel.many doctors want to keep their patients in a state of managed sickness.they want to put patients on meds and keep them coming back indefinately.that way they make more    .
i ve alway taught my children to listen to their intuition. the two times i didn t listen to mine it turned out badly. i m a great believer in your intuition.
absolutely excellent video and advice.  thank you so very much!
i m a disabled veteran almost seventy years old.  if i listened to the doctors  i would be dead or worse.  these rush job doctors are just that  a rush job trying to give you drugs without using a checklist.  pilots use checklist to save lives  why don t doctors use checklist   it would make a huge difference in the health of our country.  natural cures have made a huge improvement in my life where the doctors drugs had no positive results and terrible negative side effects.
copy that patriot nurse. have done that and continue to do that. yes ive always been that outcast we have today....must be fulfilling my  destiny !retired carpenter  and ex athlete....waiting for that blessed hope !shalom
hey patriot nurse i am a 50 year mechanic and i love your videos. you are so smart and practical with good common sense and biblical knowledge and quite beautiful. keep up the good work. your videos are giving us great information. thanks for your patriotic service.
great post patriot nurse!thanks for the truth and helping others to make an informed rational decision   happy new year  cjs in la
great information! thank you for sharing patriot nurse!
thank you again for your insight and remainders of the assets god gave us to know what s what!!
yes.  we nurses have always thought that the important papers giving the surgeon  hospital permission to do the procedure shoved at you the morning of surgery is wrong.  part of that paper says you have had the procedure thoroughly explained  including all possible complications.   we know that is not often done  don t we my fellow registered nurses.if things were ethical  on last day you see your surgeon before surgery  then they would be explaining and having you sign.
always an outstanding video and presentation
difficult subject matter that matters   great instruction for those who receive it.
mind blowing video  you said all of the right words and made it all make sense. let this be a reminder that god protects his children.
i like that advice of  safe and effective  as i hadn t thought of that. my knee-jerk reaction is to say  no  with emphasis  but i see the wisdom of taking the attitude of you suggest. i recognize how that can benefit me. i long ago recognized the attitude of medical people taken towards me  and now i understand why. i ve long been the  patient  who does my own research and makes my choices  often against the  system  and i recognized  drs  don t like this.  i m up against a big decision now  as i have a solid aneurysmal bone cyst in my tibia  that must be removed  and i m really unsure which route to take. sadly the internet is not providing me in-depth info on options  and the medical advice i m given is surgery is the option.  hard spot to be in with time against me....
may the lord bless you! i so needed to hear everything you said about interviewing  and that  oversharing the truth is not going to set you up for success !  for whatever reasons  i have until now acted like i was under oath  which i think you  said   you re not under .....   and have felt compelled to tell the truth  the whole truth  and nothing but the truth  and that has not been my friend! everything we say can and will be used against us.  confession is good for the soul   but be very careful who we are confessing to! i thank the lord for you and your wisdom!!
is it painful
checkout youtube.  someone else might have struggled with it and may give advice.  it helped me when i had locked thumbs. good luck.
i did a quick google search using the words   treatment of solid aneurysmal bone cyst   and the first thing to come up was   the interventional radiology treatment of aneurysmal bone cyst involves a series  one every 3 months  of minimally invasive treatment injections of a drug called doxycycline. the therapy is performed as an outpatient procedure with minimal recovery time.   i hope that helps you.
exactly.  if you have a 97 or 98  chance of overcoming a disease or virus...let your body do its job!  common sense.
thank you. i ll get back to you. that is a good one.  i have a good friend who needs a knee replacement. she told her doctor she was highly allergic to certain metals.  he made a search of every manufacture he knew and all were made with mixed metals. that isn t something  they  test you for or discuss.
the doctor that i ve been seeing for over a decade has flipped flopped. in the beginning she was caring and i could talk to her and things were great. they moved there office and ever since she has become a pill pusher  vaccine pusher and doesn t seem to want to listen to me any more. the sad thing is she has great credentials as far as education goes. the first time i went to see her after the c came out she stood in a corner and was afraid to get to close. i have a big problem finding another doctor. this is pathetic as i am over 70 and at an age that they want you dead. i understand what you said in this video.
i just found out that i had a silent heart attack 2 years ago. dr in the er gave me an iv for the dehydration from vomiting and sent me home with an anti emesis drug and didn t say anything about the  cardiac event . i found out when i read the ekg results a couple of weeks ago. i asked for a cardiac consult and was told i had to see my primary doctor despite having a positive ekg showing i now have cardiac problems that have not been addressed for 2 years. i told another doctor that i view them as educators and i make the decision whether to follow what they propose for me to do or not. she was a bit surprised by my comments but agreed with me.
great video! thank you. unfortunately it s didn t work out for us trying to advocate for what we wanted. my husband of almost 50 years and i got covid and double pneumonia in october of 2021. i was in intensive care for 8 days. my husband went in a couple days after me. my grown son told them explicitly not to give us remdesivir. they said we would both die if they could not treat us with that drug  and that they would not treat us without it. don t know why or how  but the hospital gave it to us anyway. it took them 5 days to kill my husband. his kidney were destroyed and could not even be saved with dialysis. he had no problems with his kidneys before he got sick. of course they also put him on a ventilator. we live in tennessee. i don t know why i survived. if any hospital tries to administer remdesivir  get the out asap.
wowzer lady ! you just blew my mind with the truth coming out your mouth!!  you are truly blessed and sharing the words  thank you indeed!!do you offer private patient advocacy services   if so  i would love some consults. if not  please do so! as you have a lot of very important information the good people need to know about. it took me 20  years of savage attacks and fighting with all i had in me to try to protect my disabled brother sucked into  and abused ongoing  by that system. it s truly an abomination that i detest  bc now i can see beyond the smoke and mirrors. so please keep preaching.
we are living in a world of people that have been paid off.
god bless you and your family
@lindac3794  thank you sweetheart
excellent video content!  thank you.  always follow your gut.  still a pure blood!
excellent advise.  i needed to hear this.  thank you.
thankfully the staff at my dr s office is supportive and generally agrees with our choices on treatment.
you are correct in what you are telling people!
pn  i have been telling people this since i was a child. i did become formally educated  but  i saw this clearly as a child. people  you do not have to have any formal education to make the best decisions for yourself. trust your instincts  do not allow  yourself to be intimidated by anyone with a so-called formal  education.
i ve been targeted by the military medical complex including one of their head cheeses.  my electronic health records are well known and discussed and mischaracterized due to my having some rare disorders that were labeled as somatoform disorder.  talk about a bad relationship with the medical community.
thank you so much patriot nurse. i absolutely love the way you educate us. like a true  intelligent  caring and loving  smart woman of god! much love.
great job on today s info!  thanks!
i had  stomache pain  that became gut pain. so bad comparatively  labor was nothing.three days of going back to er  they finally decided to do a pregnancy test  that came back positive  and admitted me for a d and c  saying it was a miscarriage or tubular.   while in pre-op  for emergency d and c  a training nurse came in with the lead nurse. as an observer.   after they left  this girl came back in   doing her side job during nursing school as a  cleaner    watching me go through a bout of  vise grip  cramping  bp went up  pulse racing  blinded by it    says  this looks like food poisoning. and told me to question the nurse for a test before they do the procedure  so i did  the nurse got authorization and they did it  it was.   added to my iv   another bag  for  12 hours  my husband was military and away at school  when they realized it was fp and no treatment for three days  they had my husband brought back be aise i could die  and i was pregnant so he could lose both.   well i came back to after twelve hours of iv treatment  was there another 5 day.  released.   had my girl 8 months later and they found a nodule looking like a peanut on my placenta .. that was the twin of my baby girl. died as an embryo.   it was sent out and analyzed  and i was told at my post checkup what it was.     and it was something my obgyn had never encountered    and researched to find they never did an ultrasound when i had the  vise grip  kept sending me back home as  hysterical  never did a stool.orvurine sample  just on appearance  made a dx. and almost killed 3 3 me and two babies.  my daughter missed that twin knowing nothing for 5 years  when i had her sister  she said  there s my twin. and they grew up together like twins.  at 25 and 30  never had that separation of siblings   teenagers  look enough alike  they could be twins.
important experience  thank you for telling
practicing medicine......on you. had my share of telling them no and thankful today for it.
great advice . i am very careful what i tell my doctor..
the eeg technician was on her smartfone during my last strobe eeg test to trigger seizure activity.  these young ones with scrubs on arent paying attention to the patient   thats dangerous.  ty for all you do!
i was upset with my primary doctors office for not doing their job or answering the phone   you could get the appointment staff but never his staff . the doctor was ok but his staff kept screwing up. took me 6 months to get a sleep study done for a cpap machine . anyway i told him i might have to find someone else  the next visit i was handed off to a nurse practitioner and haven t seen him since! i guess i was a trouble making patient.
you always speak the truth!
@teresarenee3829  i have been trying to get used to mine for a year  i dread having to use the thing. i wakes me up when i move wrong and starts blowing  air out the side making farting noises! aggg! doctor says i need this for my health!!
about 6 years ago  while the hospital was trying to figure out what was going on  they started with throwing meds at it. they didn t even discuss anything with me. they just came in saying  i got your meds.  i replied   what meds  i don t take meds.   we you re in this wing and everybody gets ...  my stance was that this is not how any of this works. we can have a conversation  but i will not just take what you re throwing at me. no.  so you re refusing the medication    yes.   snarky look and notes taken.   yes i was the problem child.  and healthy now. lol.
30 yrs in radiology and i concur.
this is a fabulous video. thank you for your wisdom.
we all need to do this.
very informative most of what i suspected the situation was thanks
thank you so much  patriot nurse!
i am from the northeast and i appreciate your message very much. thank you.
many years ago back in the late nineties and early 2000 a surge of breast cancer started. every client of mine when they went to the dr. came back with the diagnose of breast cancer  and that has gotten worse. now  every client of mine when they go to the dr. comes back with maybe skin cancer and their skin looks like a war zone. what s really disturbing is they are almost going back every month to get zap some where. i guess it s a different way to make more money or a new something came out and they need to pay for it.
it has been my observation of people around me and in my area of northern illinois that the vast majority of them are ill and on a constant merry go round schedule of doctor appointments  day after day after day. bottles and bottles of prescriptions on their countertops. as time goes by  they get sicker and sicker  all the while still believing  their doctors are helping them. sad. very sad. my take away of all of this from years of watching this happen to many people i know   stay away from the white coats. they really have no idea of what they re doing anymore. stay out of the doctors office and stay healthy. there s no such thing as a correct diagnosis anymore. pill pushers is all they are.
thank you for all you do. god bless!
always listen to your intuition! spiritual discernment is a gift from god that all humans have. the question is.....are we listening to those intuitive promptings
what i learned it other people are the ultimate counter party risk. i learned to limit my exposure to them. especially during a pandemic. sometimes a little bit of common sense goes a long way. also this pandemic was classist. it was the throw the least valuable person off of the boat exercise.
the ability god gave us is  discernment  we are commanded to seek discernment and right now we need to be praying for better discernment
new sub here  your name is mentioned several times in comment sections of different prepper channels i watch. thank you subs for spreading the word  i like her message.
i wish someone had told me these things when it could have made a difference. i m not a human being to either the school or medical corporations   is what i found out. listen up people ! i d like to broadcast this video to every graduating senior class in the u. s. so they could be forewarned and fore armed with the truth.
my wife went into the hospital the 11th of july with acute appendices.  they took her off blood thinners to operate.  then they decided to treat her with antibiotics.  she was in 2 days to get her back on blood thinners and iv antibiotics.  she was home with a weeks prescription of 2 strong antibiotics.  a week later she saw our dr and he ordered a ultrasound to get her back in. the radiologist made arrangements to get her back in as the appendix was leaking. they still took over 40 hours to operate and it burst. they removed so much bowel thatvshe will always have problems. she believes they treated her like that because she is just over 70 and un v ed. alberta.
my female intuition is my religion alongside with god!!!!thank you for your insight and work
thanks for the straight talk.  the hospital killed my unjabbed bf when he went to the er for  covid  pneumonia.  they wouldn t give him anything but protocol  degraded his health until he finally consented to the vent where he  of course  died days later.  also they forbid anyone to visit him.
god gave us all a conscience to know right from wrong.
they avoided whitnesses
i had a childhood friend the same thing happened to her fiance...
hello patriot nurse. i am in healthcare but i am not a nurse. wondering what your take is on the nursing strike in new york. i see alot of potential fallout beyond lack of patient care. any insight
god bless you for all you do.
we have found that 9 x out of 10 the nurses know more than the dr. s do. most dr. s seem to be totally detached from the tasks at hand. if the  dr. even shows up to work  their minds are still somewhere else. scary crazy days we are in.
the patriot news appreciate your videos listening  from mass usa tyvm
ha ha ha  just not long ago i went into a  walk in clinic  doctors office to get help with my swollen feet.  my feet were in really bad shape  but when the doctor came in  i almost laughed.  he was wearing a cloth mask  and a visor  and a coat.  he would not come within 6ft of me  but gave me a prescription for an anti biotic for what i do not know.  he never once looked at my swollen feet.
the doctors will not go over your blood lab results  they just say   its ok for now
yeah.  they re probably all in thought about how many more prescriptions they need to write and sell to afford that prince s cruise they want.
thank you! this video has helped to confirm thoughts that i ve had. bless you!!!
thank you   great advice! much needed.
s  it s truly amazing in a sad negative way that there are scammers on this youtube page.
people need to be calling their state representatives to amended the state constitution to specifically list health freedom as right  and clearly specify the limits of medical intervention in the health of your family. of course  everyone thinks that the  crisis  is over  but they are just getting started.
amen  people use your brains!
a few years ago my gp wanted me to stare taking lipitor only reason was high triglycerides  i said no let me re-test and come back  a month later it was much lower and he said wow how did you do that  i said changed my diet.
ty for reminding me of listening to my intuition. i too have saved lots of money from utilizing safe and natural ways to address issues and avoid the need of going into a dr office and thus their rx. however  i would love to know when needing a surgeon  what process do you use in choosing one. tia.
my white blood count is low. it has been for 2 years. my dr sent me to the oncologist for  further  blood test. the first thing the dr asked was  we aren t going to find any aids or hepatitis are we    i looked at her and held my tongue because i didn t want my tests sabotaged. then when i went back to get the results the nurse said there is nothing you can do or take for it. i hadn t even asked her anything. people were sitting back there all hooked up to an iv and probably nothing was wrong for real. needless to say i haven t been back and i have blocked their phone number. a lot of it is a scam and people need to get second and third opinions. i ve been pumping up my vitamins and veggies. best believe they got a bad review!
patriot nurse  you are absolutely right
once again thank you for you re time an knowledge.. i have always gone with my gut feeling and so far its not let me down.   god bless
i agree with you 1 000 00   sadly so many of  we the people   are not conscious and need to be reminded...
no wonder my previous doc didn t like me and suggested i was non compliant  to my wife.  my new doc is great and talks with me  not down to me. guess i m non compliant. thanks.
thank you for your wise words and faith in the one true god! we need more medical providers that think like you do! also  you look very sophisticated in this video!  not that you normally don t  but  extra fancy today! love from texas.
told my dr he sees me as tests n doesn t like i choose natural because meds are what caused me to have health issues after 2 tia s n that s when i stopped the support of others pockets who don t really care thank you  god bless
i agree 100 .  common sense!
that post was only halfway through what you were saying  now that we ve got to the end  that is fantastic advice to people.but also don t be afraid death because that s what they re counting on.
love you  patriot nurse!
thank you for the information. i will share this.

very good advice. thank you very much. i wish it was  that easy in real life .
thanks all the questions are asked at the first of the year  god bless you thank you so much
more than once i ve had to remind these practitioners that they are service providers  and that effectively makes them servants.
always follow your instincts it s your natural ability to survive in this world.by following others like sheep will bring you ruin...and you will forfeit yourself just to follow the crowd.
back when i was in elementary school there was little league baseball.  they only gave awards to the teams that were 1st  2nd  and third place only. there was no such thing as participation trophies. this was back in early to mid-1970s.
nurse  your right on and 100 percent right!
it s called gut feeling...human instincts
you are sooooo appreciated!
in today s world  sadly  most doctors i have seen do not care!!!!!! i m  also  scared to death of needles and have been literally been made fun of because of that!!!! just sad!!!
i have been a dental hygienist for 44 years and i have seen so many changes in dentistry over the years. the mom and pop dental offices are disappearing and the retiring dentists are selling out to corporate dental  businesses   there is very little empathy left for patients. i work in one of the last mom and pop offices and we have patients coming to our office who have experienced corporate dentistry and feel that they have had unnecessary treatment done. we are booked months ahead because we don t have enough manpower.it has been a struggle to find new employees. six of us are over 60 and will be retiring in the next few years. we are  old school  and treat our patients with empathy and kindness.  we only do necessary treatment and  combine dental health with systemic  health. we still educate the patient and give them a choice.  there is never any pressure or condescending behavior. thank you patriot nurse for your great input. i agree with you totally.in another note  i noticed the menorah and books in your bookcase. do you belong to a messianic jewish congregation  i am a messianic jew. i was wondering. you have made reference to scripture.blessings and shabbat shalom sm
appreciate all your great sharing keep up the great work
thank you for the encouragement!
i was told by a doctor that i should take a medication even though it caused me adverse effects. she said i needed to learn to deal with it for the greater good. i told her no. it s my body  i deal with enough with my allergies and asthma. i will not suffer for the greater good and be miserable.
great video. you are spot on. love your videos!!!!!
i noticed them too.
yes..  a very interesting video. certainly something i feel comfortable subscribing to. tell you what   ..i read a number of the posted comments  and i do tend to agree with the thoughts and feelings of many who posted their thoughts.  as for me..   in essence   i too  went to see a pcp for the first time  just last fall. there..  because i am very overweight and have a ms diagnosis from 2016  it seemed...  regardless of my telling her my own thoughts about my health  she was interested and listened  though i could tell  that after a few opinions of my own..  my intuition told me..  i was in a mental competition with this medical professional  as i am completing a juris doctor  and have been in the legal field since 1995. yes..  as i too  am trained to not believe my clients when they give me their thoughts and opinions.  i could tell from experience  she was fully prepared to prescribe and treat  but as a obese  middle aged ms patient  who she felt  ...must be checked for  glucose  cholesterol  and everything else as it pertained to the manner in which a doctor would logically evaluate  diagnose  and later..   treat a patient.  instead  i told her   i am not interested in merely treating symptoms.  what i want to do..  is determine which problems i have  then develop a corrective action plan  heavy on healthy eating  lifestyle changes  stick to my plan to lower my bp with daily treadmill exercise  as i have done for decades  which is very effective in lowering blood pressure  reduces edema  and improves circulation .  further   as it pertained to cholesterol...  i prefer to simply change my regular diet in-lieu of an rx for statin medication  and begin 1.  eliminating foods that contribute to high cholesterol  2.  begin putting chia seeds into my daily hot coffee cups  and 3.  maybe take some lecithin pills  just for extra insurance.  as for the ms diagnosis in 2016   i believe it to have been a false read  as it was 2016 and now 2023  likely anaphylactic shock due to micotoxins in the home for several years prior..  and later causing breathing problems  for  several years later...  i.e...   food poisoning via moldy food..  and -  happily....i have not had any significant problems in re a typical ms profile  as last year s mri stated  no active demylination. the purpose for my emergency visit  ...i have had ongoing problems with balance and dizziness  more attributed to a severe middle ear infection  requiring amoxicillin with augmentin...fyi fyr is augmentin a very strong antibiotic  augmentin can fight against a broader range of bacteria than amoxicillin alone. therefore  augmentin may be considered a stronger antibiotic than amoxicillin. the potency of the antibiotic depends on the infection and the type of bacteria causing the infection.dec 14  2021  ask google what infections will augmentin treat augmentin is commonly used to treat a variety of bacterial infections including     sinusitis  inflammation or infection of the sinuses      pneumonia     ear infections     bronchitis     urinary tract infections  and.    infections of the skin.in closing  yes..  i too believe  intuition  is a person s age and experience  telling him or her  what is happening without the body saying a word  and as i am 56  just three years from being a 60 year old man..    i learned to trust my instincts.   i hope this helps  and thank you. -peace. mdm  jd candidate.
excellent video!!!! well communicated!!
ty     for your work. . god bless you and your family
this lady is full of sense!!!!!!
top  your words were truth and lighty  shiny lightbeam
i had a doctor i was trying to reach  on the phone about an important matter once years ago. and after i had already used his services. the doctor kept trying to avoid me and hide. i m not a man that someone runs and hides from i will get you to answer the phone. the last time i called that doctor s office. i told him staff if he doesn t get on that phone. i m going to call the board of medicine and the american medical association and we ll see what they think. the doctor was on that phone within ten seconds.
thank you!  i sincerely wonder what comes across medicare medicaid and other doctors desks.  do they get so much info from the company they work for that  they have no time to research   a doctor i ve had for much of 30 years actually got mad at me for refusing the vax  shingles   tdap  i somehow survived shingles in 2020 amazingly.  i also survived chicken pox when i was 7.  i really don t want anything inserted into me with mrna  mercury  formaldehyde or aluminum in them  which various of these ingredients are in tdap  covid  and others i have refused.  i was told if i wouldn t follow the recommendations  i should probably get another doctor.  i don t understand why she got so mad.  maybe these doctors have some kind of requirement to get certain things done  since the electronic system was forced onto doctors.  all doctors had to have this from what i understand.  i don t understand her reaction at all!  anyone else understand it
excellent video excellent advice blessings to you for these important facts and information
i stay out of hospitals and doctor s offices. the body can heal itself given proper nutrition and care.
i was prescribed a blood pressure medication at the hospital visit. at that time i was under high stress  and a fast food diet. i may of needed the medication  to lower my bp at that time but i decreased my stress and drastically change my diet.  i took the medication few days our of hospital.  it made me dizzy  so i stopped it. i had appointment with my primary physician.  she made a comment about the meds working. i didn t tell i wasn t taking it.  she just gave me a prescription for more. nothing suggesting about diet etc. i even hinted and question about it. so i walked out without making another appointment.
i have big time lost faith in the medical system very recently. i ve had a lifelong problem with my ankle and i ve had braces to put on my ankle all my life. i went to a new hospital to get checked out for a new pain and possibly get a new brace. so i go to the hospital they tell me nothing is wrong..... i disagree being that i had a new pain but then i ask if they can recommend me a place so i can go get a brace made. the doctor looks at me and tells me that they don t make braces for this kind of thing. i looked at her baffled and just left. i went to another hospital and now i have a brace for my ankle. there s been many other little things here and there that have made me raised an eyebrow and go wtf. it seems to be the younger the medical  professional  the less they they know. and being that i work for a university i am acutely aware that they don t need to know anything to get their degree they just need to pay for it.
i love. listening to you and have learned great things from you. thank you.  you re wise and wonderful.
hi... would you be conducting training in florida in 2023  i live in the jacksonville area  and i would like to attend you in person training if you are in this area. thank you for all the information that you provide. happy new year!!
at 55. i ve learned way more from dr berg and dr berry off the internet then all my doctors i ve ever seen.  most doctors i ve experienced are   pushers.  always late and narcissistic.
i told my doctor that i was done with any shots he wants me to have moving forward. boom!
it was a blessing!!
i just want to use this opportunity to thank the rn who helped me deliver my 1st son almost 50 yrs ago - afterward  3 hrs total   my  doctor arrived from the golf course...the  4k should ve gone directly to that good nurse.
i have a great relationship with my doctor . she recommends things . i think about it and then politely decline . she will ask  recommend  again a few times at later dates and i decline at later dates . eventually she stops recommending   asking . she has asked only once if i wanted too be jabbed and i have only had too decline her offer once . a good relationship in my opinion.
good work pn!
thank you so much for your information. be blessed jv.
my mom would tell me to pay attention to my cravings because its my body telling me what it needs eat at the time. just not too much sugar . . .
my father in law almost died from cancer due to a  warm body with a medical degree.  he is a d.o. which i don t even consider a real doctor  in the local va. he wouldn t do a simple test that could have prevented a lot of pain over the past 6 years.
as always i learn from your videos- so much. so glad to see that you re gettig over your sickness.  godbless you!     !
most people don t have the mental resilience to go against the medical establishment.  so many years of being told that doctors know best.
maam-you are my hero-you are so strong and knowledgeable-you are a blessing to all of us-thank you for speaking out-
i have been looking for a new doctor for a while. i went to a new one who inquired or assumed my position on the stick. proceeded to tell me that he needed to stop arguing with people which i was silent on. i needed my antidepressant filled so i tried my best to keep my mouth shut. at one point he said well if you want to orphan your kids that s fine i guess. i was speechless. i wanted to throat punch him and leave but i said nothing for the rest of the visit except answering questions as if i was not livid which i was. i just needed my meds refilled. what an indoctrinated  a  hole! i will never go back. still looking for doctor
why didn t he change doctors
why didn t he sue
i ve been taking my personal health very seriously  especially over the last few months.dieting and exercise is a great way to not have to rely on doctors who just want to shove pills down your throat.too often herbal remedies can be extremely beneficial and we should look to them more.
as always great stuff! love ya lady!
amen sis may jesus bless you  in these times
thank you so much for this video. you are a great help and blessing.
unfortunately  i was a victim of the medical establishment in may 2022.  i was in need of an ablation.  when the procedure was scheduled i was told that i would be called the day before with the information i needed for my procedure.  the only information they provided was the time to arrive and not to take my blood pressure medications.  ok  simple enough  i arrived and went through the admittance process and went to my room.  i did not question the various forms i saw on the electronic tablet and just signed the forms.  these folks are medical professionals and thus  they must be trustworthy.  i was  regrettably  wrong.  in those micro-typed forms was a consent form that i should not have signed.  they had the legal right to do whatever they wanted - i was at their mercy.  i did voluntarily enter my room.  that was the last voluntary process throughout the entire procedure.  i am still dealing with the effects of that ordeal.  i learned my lesson.  from now on  i will severely limit any consent so that either i or my wife retain all of the control outside of the or.  anything that they desire to do  they must ask permission and it must be granted before any action is taken.  if any future surgeries are needed  i will try to have a recording devise with me to document the compliance to my instructions.  never again will i be a medical victim.
in addition to med pros there are busybodies in schools  nurses  principals  teachers  guidance counsellors  psychologists   neighbours   acs cps et al.
white coats and letters after the name  do not know my body or my intuition.  and if they do not listen i leave.
thanks for all u do patriot nurse..can you please do a video on consent it s such an important topic
you put it nicely. i can think of more direct descriptions of their shenanigans.
thanks again.  as usual needed to hear this.
god bless you in jesus name spiritually  mentally  physically  and financially amen.
i can imagine you re not really popular with drs these days huh  lol.. good for you! thanks for standing up for the truth.
speaking of creation and i think this may attribute to your message. i ve been speaking of creation a lot as of late  people seem to focus on a spectrum of creation when we discuss certain dynamics of a topic. we never discuss creation in its entirety and the one thing i have noticed while having these discussions is people always leave god out of the equation. as i have had these conversations people have actually asked me why i always bring god into it. i ask them how can i not  it all started with god  god is the cornerstone of creation  everything correlates to god. if we don t respect all of gods creation then we are incapable of respecting any of it or appreciating it. that intuition that you are speaking of is god. your intuition has never let you down or took you the wrong way  your intuition is always correct. i have to believe that our intuition is a direct connection to god. i definitely think it is in our best interest to listen to our intuition.
patriot nurse i trust my doctor completely!  he is a naturopathic dr!  he  does acupuncture  nutritional iv s  and herbal remedies!
i don t listen to myself  i listen to the holy spirit that lives inside of me
i am definately a  medical victim  !!!
thanks for the message! p.s.i love your hair here  and those bright colors look amazing on you! you are a  winter  for coloring.
my father was a medical formulator eli lilly the guy that tested the medicine on the animals he kept us from taking some of the vaccines in the sixties that he had already tested on his animal subject
you are amazing.  thank u
off subject but can you do a video on the best way to relocate a dislocated elbow in a self rescue situation or is that something you cover in the in person classes.
i am quite ill in cold weather due to fibromyalgia. a friend wants me to go into assisted living.  having been a single woman most of my life i have seen and been through too much with men. furthermore i live in the midwest where men are believed over women no matter what the crime. i simply don t want to be some pervert s victim
it s been 2 years since i ve been to a doctor i m scared of them they all complied  i m jest worry about what else they will comply too.
my whole being was telling me no when i had my ovary removed. now i m 29 with adrenal issues and i m not sure if i m going to be able to have kids.
good message  i can relate to it.
i rely on my owen intuition as having had 3 hemorrhagic stroke  12 hrs sergery to remove byfrontal avm ! after last bleed ! that left clamps  and clips  doctor wanted me to have mri and i can t have one ! i rilly had to stand my ground with him
my spidey senses went off big time back in 2019 with a jab that was being rushed to market. i am a pure blood and i plan on staying that way. i do no care what they say now. me and my wife are both pure bloods.
thank you.  good info. that i needed to hear and learn.
you are totally correct!!  god bless you.
brilliant! glad i found your channel  and subbed .
i am a victim but i m putting it behind me to pursue a millionaire mindset
here is something i learned from the chosen season 3 and the explanation.  i learned that in early judaism doctors were not to be sought over the lord.  2 chronicles 16 12   in the thirty-ninth year of his reign asa became diseased in his feet. his disease was severe  yet even in his disease he did not seek the lord   but the physicians. .it wasn t until closer to the first century   around the time of christ that physicians were seen in a  better  light  due to the pagan and hellenistic practices from the greeks.  physicians were called in greek  sozo    having a dual meaning healer and  or savior. bottom line from a surgical  cardiac cathlab rn  there are good and there are bad doctors. that s jokingly why they call it  practice   i m not trying to sound spiritual or preachy  but what is sad is when individuals put their full trust in a doctor.  some will even ask me if dr. so and so  sozo  is a  good  doctor   in order to not lose my job or slander a hospital or physician  i can not tell them. this is heart breaking.  i know some good doctors and i know some that their only intention is the money. i recommend first go to the great physician jesus the christ or yshua  like the woman who had an issue of bleeding for 12 years  despite spending all her money on doctors.  it took just reaching out for the lord. after that listen to the holy spirit.  then your intuition.  god will not forsake you. yes maybe god will not heal you here on earth  but god will be faithful and you will be healed. god bless.
right on patriot nurse !
i left a 15 year very successful rn career because of the current state of  science  and healthcare. when nurses are written up for teaching about natural immunity  something that is a fact in every microbiology textbook written for the past 200 years  then it s time to go. i kept my license and will use it again when they stop rewriting real science to suit political narratives.
thank you. keep my mouth shut. i tried that this week.worked ok. before covid they kept asking me if i got a flu shot. i would say hope. don t believe in them. i tried it when they 1st came out an got real sick. i ve had 2 doctors be really rude to me. that was after my doctor retired. 4 years now and still don t have a doctor. i m going to a new one tomorrow. hope i don t have to fire him. i ll try to be quiet
my in-laws think anyone in a white coat is  god .  my husband and i have tried educating them but they re very stuck in their ways   ignorant.  my fil even goes in the drs office with political jokes  needless to say  they ve been given every shot   booster there is.  i pray for them everyday...
yes ive learned out of neccesity how to handle those situations.  be on gaurd and say less.  listen to my intuition for sure.  your so on point.  thankyou for your very wise information. btw i have an appointment next week with new pcp.  im ready...lol
you have a choice  but  your medical records have notations  and ever other doctor you see  will see those notations.  they will get your previous doctor s viewpoint.  and it will taint theirs.
...punitively respond to...  and  ...ignorance as a patriotic duty...   !!!!!  there s power in a well-turned phrase.   you have a way with words!
very well done video.  buyer beware.  thank you.  god bless you
thank you  girl
so disturbing how doctors just push pharma.  years ago my cholesterol was  borderline  .  she simply called in a script.  never asked about my diet or suggested what foods to cut back on.  i didn t pick up prescription and never went back to her.
agree!good advice!
ty pn!
a physician is someone who puts chemicals they know little about into a body they know less about - some wise man
which is why it s best to stay away from the racket entirely.
one of the definitions of intuition is  knowing without knowing  .
it s been this way since i was young  decades ago.ask yourself why they limit so heavily the number of students allowed to attend medical schools.
great advice  thank you.
it is a lot more complicated than all the truths that you echoed. most people have no gut!! they have been duped by the food industry  doctors  drug industry etc. media.they are addicted to junk food and fast fix drugs.  even educated folks have a limited scope of health and understanding or wisdom. i ve been into health since the early 80 s.what i see now is really bad and getting worse. i smelled a rat from the get go and my gut worked but i m a rare bird. god bless you and your message. they have eyes but cannot see.
thank you!
wondering if anyone has an opinion on this  i am scheduled for a colonoscopy  have never had one  and am way overdue according to the recommendations  and an endoscopy because of my reflux and digestive issues. anything i should be cautious of  also  i m sure they will ask me if i ve had the  coof v . i haven t  but since they have access to my electronic records  they will be able to see that i haven t  if i lie and say yes i have. if i say i don t want it  i m scared some rogue nurse will  v  me when i m  under . thoughts
i disagree with being chill relaxed in in essence  lying about your vaccine status. my mother  baxton-boosted  is fighting a sudden onset rapidly growing tumor. with the staff shortages medical supply shortages and at least in our area  gi surgeon shortages  i ve been battling for her for 6 months and i have found  to be completely honest  that i have had to take a hard line  and a very open  sometimes confrontational attitude in order to get her the care and treatment she needs. it is also been necessary for me to be quite forceful in preventing them from taking further c19 actions shall we say. i do not scream color or cuss  but i state facts because i ve done a ton of research and i was a med tech so i know how hospitals work and i know my rights and my mother s rights. as a result when she was in a hospital in new york supposedly with covid i was the first person ever allowed to visit on the covid floor. this was just a few months ago. there s something called civil human rights that cannot be violated. you should be giving better advice  such as become your families health proxy. simple and free to do you can print the forms out online for your state. once you have those papers in hand  new state anywhere in this country can stop you from seeing your loved one no matter the circumstances by law. if you want to go a step further  75 online will get you  ordained. and as your family members religious pastor or whatever you want to call yourself  they cannot stop you from seeing them either this is how we were allowed more than one person in every hospital she s been at. another tip  if they try to violate your rights or give a medication such as remyouknowwhat  tell him you re going to sue them. do not holler at do not scream it just state it as a fact. so far  i have made that statement twice. once that statement left my mouth we were treated completely different. we were shown respect she was given the care that she required and no more than that. know your rights. and stand firm on them. had i gone in being chill and fake compliant  my mom would be in a much much worse position. nothing good ever comes from being a sheep  fake or not. so i must respectfully disagree. as far as the health proxy goes  do not wait until an emergency to need it. get your health proxies in order now.
thank you. how true.
i do not always agree with your past videos however finally information that actually makes sense.  thank you.
yep it s funny everytime i said i worked in healthcare on a particular website i got accused of being a janitor. nothing wrong with being a janitor  but i wasn t. god bless that i m a pure blood.and will never take another jab again.
any medical office that requires masks--especially on children  child abuse --doesn t get my respect.
jesus its great and been a long time since ive heard common sense....thank you
do you have any suggestions on how to not have to take the covid test to go under general anesthetic for a surgery
definitely awesome ! i feel the very same way!!
all i know  is in the 60 s-70 s  even 80 s my older relatives didn t go one single week without a doctor s appt. any and every kind of doctor. it was as if that s what made them important  their identity was what was  wrong . diagnosis and pills and new discoveries were a feast. they would shame others for not doing this or trying their mis-care. they had an  ill  mentality  consuming every medical thing they could. worrying about their insurance and coverage and billing and juggling their history of records. it was so  so sick. i don t think this generation can even imagine. but many of the old care-provider attitudes remain  because the us system s is so broken. my co-worker and i counted one day. of ten patients between just us  5 pts each... we suspected maybe 3 or 4  maybe  had coverage for their stay. routine 60-70   loss  repeatedly  these people are in the hospital more than at home. so many  many meds they can t keep them straight. more and more people who know no english. people who have no one to care for them. no home. how long can it go on  generations have made themselves culturally medical dependents   victims .
be careful what you sign make sure you aren t authorizing them without knowing.
that would worry me too!
don t do it  they have non invasive option you can do at home and mail back to the lab. unless you re having issues.
unfortunately in my area near madison  wi   you literally have the mask police coming after you if you don t wear one when you step inside any clinic for medical care or any hospital! it s such a joke!
ground breaking  but true.
excellent but please! please turn on captioning for the hard of hearing and the deaf.
well done..pn.  how we skirted around those certain words. our  7th grader was asked about guns in the house for a sports physical.
thanks michelle.  great stuff as always.  many thanks from manchester  england.  ant
sometimes with medical decisions it s important to take a pause. while taking that pause remember god made you and he doesn t make junk.
isn t there a saliva test
@marieblaszak8552  i m not for sure but i don t want to have to be required to take a covid test to have surgery.  that s why i asked the question.
as a young  healthy person in the 80 s paying into the dysfunctional insurance medical catastrophe  i was so angry with them. the costs of healthcare went up and up and up and we never even used the benefits. never even met the deductibles. they were dysfunctionally-feasting off of the numerous youth payments  and it was allowed to continue to their deaths  often while remaining in the hospital  with  1000 s of debt owed.
you have to do that on your end.  there s a little icon on the video that looks like a gear   or  depending on what you re using  a little square that says cc.  click or tap on that and you should get an option to turn on closed captioning.
@earndoggy  thank you  i see the cc is available now. it wasn t available when i watched the premier in progress. i appreciate your help  thanks.
@mary-ue4ir  you re welcome.   that s too bad that it wasn t available for the premier.  ugh.
we need more holistic doctor s  that have that ancient knowledge along with current knowledge to be presented for the patents most informed decision
well said
god dang women! you have come a long way since i told you about the false narrative we have been given. this whole video is what people should hear. this is a statement of who should we believe  or not to trust. please keep up with this truth. keep acting accordingly.
you are such a blessing !
a close relative was diagnosed with several mental problems from two medical communities in my city. it wasn t until the third hospital community they went to did bloodwork and found an extreme vitamin b12 and vitamin d deficiency. they kept them overnight and with infusions released the next day. they did not diagnose them with anything mental. why would a hospital or two not do bloodwork to rule out a physical cause instead of just wanting to put someone into psychiatric situations
one of the worst things to do for your health is see a modern doctor.
i was born with this knowledge . i can t believe it has to be explained.
my step just got sent home. fluid overload he look 6 months pregnant. sent home on oxygen and no lasix . forgotten to even given a prescription for it.just left two doctors my ra and family doctor. they ve made my life so stress for 2 years now. tried working with them but they got so passive aggressive i was just over it.
patriot nurse i want to say thank you for all you do i have to ask a question i m a lifelong asthmatic severe i have it under great control with my current medicine regime i have a great doctor i love all your advice and i always keep it in the back of my mind we re dealing with any doctor i need to know your advice as a medical professional natural remedies or anything else that i can do to help keep inflammation and symptoms at bay thank you and god bless
redrum  absolutely love you re included xa. beautiful message their.

you are correct. we have an original intuition and original conscience connection to god s heart to realize god s original purpose of creation as his substantial presence in the creation to experience original truth  beauty and goodness. interesting the biota in our gut is an essential component of our intelligence and heartistic connections relationships and the the use of  antibiotics  compromises that. wisdom. thank you for your continued service to god and his family.
great vid  excellent info!
i kept telling the doc yes the kids are up to date but that wasn t enough. since i would not produce shot records  i was sent a letter of dismissal from their office.
i have a copy of the family physician by drs. pomerananz and koll. copyright 1951. it explains things and when i go to a doctor   i am armed with real information and it freaks them out.
i have run into providers who are intrusive of jab information and pushing on compliance which triggers my defensive protection.
love this gal. beauty and brains.
i lost all faith in dr.s. a person i know has worked along side of dr.s for thirty years. she told me they are the most unethical  immoral profession out there. being stupid i didn t believe her. i had to learn on my own. and i found out she was 100  truthful.
great advice and god bless
diet and botanical uses helped me greatly.
logan! ijust watched a video by dr eric berg d.c that recommends vitamins for asthma. go to his channel for his info. love patriot nurse as well. vitamin d3 comes to mind but he has lots of info on anything. god bless you!
ginger can help too
botanical wormers such as artemisia absinthium  wormwood  can help. a friend at the health food store knew a family with all types of allergies. they started regular parasite cleansing and everything cleared up.
thank you patriot nurse .
it sounds like you suggest being gray man when speaking with a new doctor. i want to know if the new doctor recommends  it  because if so  i dont want that doctor treating me! my former pcp told me if i don t get  it  i should never leave my house  for my own safety of course. there is no way i would let her treat me!!!
love your videos. your so intelligent and sweet. we need more just like you!!  intelligent and of sound mind. logical and moral. and most important --- with the spirit of jesus christ in you !!   amen !!!  thank u thank u and god bless you !!!
i listen to my intuitive voice. it has saved me many times.
only issue is if we go along with them  they win with force and will do it again in the future
i live in northern ca  my gp at palo alto medical center  pamf  told me he now can t discuss anything contradicting the  vaccines   including hydroxychloroquine  ivermectin or excess death or he will lose his license.  he makes a lot of money so he s just going along with the program.
not just us. there s a recent video of a young girl  i think about 19-22 years old  who s stuck in japan because of a doctor minipulating her to get a spinal tap... she s can no longer walk or stand and japan is not helping her so people are rasing money to get her to fly back to her country... ever since the whole drug issue here in fl  i ve very much been on my gaurd up with meidcal  even if its just cause they re human that make mistakes.
last year i experienced the passage of a kidney stone. it was more painful than all of the operations  and there were many  from a near death accident. that required many titanium implants to fix all of my broken and crushed bones. i daily  multiple times a day  thank god for the miracle of my survival. now about the kidney stone  when passing the kidney stone  i needed two shots of morphine to manage the extreme pain and i hate to even take an advil.question  do you know of any natural product such as a tincture that i can make for use if i  or someone i know  needs a painkiller for passing a stone  or for an injury    thank you   god bless you for all that you share.
excellent pn. thank you.
i have been extremely lucky with my doctors. all of them respect my right to not get the vaccine.  they just ask if i wanted it  i said no and they dropped it.  however my work  not so much. i left work a year ago because they required the vaccine.
biiiingo
an herb called stone breaker. forget it s other name. works.
@marieblaszak8552  oh  you are a life saver. thank you so kindly for sharing this information.
fresh lemon juice in distilled water.  daily as a preventative  but will help dissolve the stones.
thx for the heads up. i have a tendency to aggressively slam the narrative  and you have given me cause for pause  maybe present a more chill response might be a good idea
preach it. truthers!
agree -medicine should not be for profit. it s all goes back to the profit motive.
god does not honor a lie or a deceiver. one can say nothing - but never do the enemy s work.
just like an auto shop  if nothing s wrong with you when you get there  there will be by the time you leave. they re just practicing.
how can i contact you regarding setting up a  class  for online training using your videos and workbook    i am not sure if each person has to buy a workbook separately or one person can buy the materials
what people don t know is they have the absolute priority over their medical care. we are n control legally and need the speak up. say no. ask questions. research and hold your ground.
it s amazing how many grandchildren dr. mengele has!
if on medicare is it possible to find a doctor that understands the dangers
i stopped listening to this medical system a long time ago.
candidates for med professions must be accepted based on their morality and proper reason for submitting application.
i was in the hospital with a kidney stone  i only have one kidney  after trying to pass it for 2 days i was scheduled for stents to be put in first thing the next morning. the night before i was in a lot of pain and a nurse came in and saw how bad it was and asked if i wanted some pain meds  i said i haven t taken any yet and she said to me you will never pass that stone without pain meds you need to relax. she gave me some and i passed the stone within a hour. first thing in the morning they came to take me to surgery for the stents  i said no thanks i passed the stone last night. the doctor then showed up at my bed and said i should have the surgery anyway just in case. i told him to go to hell and get out! that was 3 years ago and no i didn t have any more stones.
you re 100  correct pn!
yes  thank you for your videos.
i ignored my instincts 1 time concerning my health. i ended up with 5 stints  having 2300cc of bile drained from my stomach and 8 months recovery because of the sepsis. needless to say i always listen to myself 1st. which can and does cause problems. i guess i need to work on my tact.
i m so glad you re back! i just accepted a  job in a very progressive school district  but the caveat is i have to get tested each week.  i feel that god has placed me here but i wonder if i m opening up a can of worms succumbing to the you-know-what weekly test.
darn. no ohio. i really enjoyed my class here last year..i am very interested in the herbal class. i know we would fill it here in columbus.
god bless you for sharing   caring.
drink lemonade several times a week  plus water often  you ll be fine
thank you for this subject . . . it happened to me . . . .
god help those under 55 who weren t raised in common sense america.. they were taught to blindly follow what the  experts  say...i have lost all trust in the medical complex. if i can t figure it out  i guess it ll kill me. as a follower of jesus christ   i m not real broke up about it anyway. i ve lived my life. but right now  i m a healthy strong 65 year old farmer chick  lola few years ago i had to go to my doctor for a bp med refill. it s the only way he can get me in  so i had the full questionnaire   including   have you fallen   i know to never answer yes... so i looked at him really quizzically and said   why would i fall  oh... sometimes as you age  you have balance issues... i continued the quizzical look like that was the stupidest question i ve ever heard.i knew with that and the gun question he was on board with the industrial medical complex. well  duh doc.. i live on a farm with horses of course i have a gun. horses live to die and vets these days don t want to make house calls. i have to be prepared to put a suffering animal down  with a tone in my voice that he sure was dense to think that a horse person wouldn t  have a  justin  gun. oh oh.. he was all flustered... ok.. that s not what i meant.. nailed
great words but in must cases futile  evil is everywhere controlling your health  include lurking inside your body  blessings!
hi from missouri
if your child is healthy do not even go and see a dr. for the yearly physical exams.     they could call social services and take your child away in order to vaccinate them.     there were so many years when i did not take my daughter in for her yearly physical   she is now 18 and in perfect health.
here is what you must know. never listen to anyone who profits if you are sick. and do as i do  have not been to a quack in 20 years. i am 80 and healthy as an ox.
very very good advice  i have been there i have been in offices all they want is your information. thanks randy
has anyone heard if the adverse affects appear within a certain amount of time after the shots or are they permanent with the possibility of more adverse affects appearing indefinitely
thank you !! keep sharing !!
it s a big club and we ain t in it !
omg  pn is right on the mark with this video.
thanks for another great video
great information. i suscribed. looking foward to listening to common sense. thank you
the test is officially not a diagnostic.
unemployment would be a better option.
those long nasal swabs have the nanotech on them and they use them to place that nanotech into the membrane up your nose because it s so close to the brain.  that nanotech works it s way into the brain and the long term damage begins.
ty for this information. i always felt uncomfortable about this requirement.
progressive  i can only imagine what else will be required.
so great to hear someone say this. nice work!
anywhere from about 2 weeks to five years. also major symptoms usually happen within the first two weeks. people get most bad reactions with the 2nd shot.
gc
but what about the ones in there that are following false teachings  .....i mean you don t need a dictionary to know they are going to end up in an aweful place in their lives and yes we are finding out how to heal ourselves ....that will also change the field of medicine and the people practicing it...thank youuuu....please let all the other nurses know don t worry jesus is at the end of the tunnel we love you very much
thank you for your channel.
i m in missouri also. hello.
this headline alone earned a subscriber
i ve been silently watching your videos over the last 5 years and i have to say that you only get more beautiful every year. love ya pn!!! truly!
you are right. this is a fact.
nice thought process!
thank you. all the best.
a physician once told me that they must admit a certain number of people in the ed. let that sink in. americans must stop with the chimp with a shiny rock mentality. by that  i mean stop being impressed by window dressing many hospitals present. focus on your care  please.
one of the most important videos you ve done.  you should screenshot all of these comments and save them for posterity  in case youtube performs the  great purge  one day.
hospitals are almost entirely corporations now. your doctor s priority is keeping his job within the corporation  like a walmart cashier.
i agree. use your gut instincts. hope you have them. i do. wake up  people. thank you.
i have a good alternative doctor but rarely need his help.  i do what nature dictates eating clean  earthing  exercising  not stressing over what i can t control. i learned how to be healthy from horses  dogs  goats  etc.  and lastly i used vermifuges for what i can t avoid in today s environment. they are a huge part of health today. people must do research.
silence is compliance.
i encourage you to look into the truth of that  star that s  in your bookcase there  if you re a christian it s not what you think  paganism
it goes back further than the 1940 s . . . john d. rockefeller established the ama  and commissioned the flexner report in 1910 - which concluded there were too many medical schools  and that allopathic medicine was the only legitimate medical practice.  other fields of study - homeopathy  naturopathy  chiropractic - have been systematically discredited since then  and all too often the most successful naturopathic physicians have suffered an untimely death.
you are worth your weight in gold!
i quit trusting healthcare industry since 2007 08. in 2021 i had covid really bad and my kids convinced me to go to our well known hospital. one of the er physician there and his nurse assistant tried to vaxx me three times while i was hyperventilating unable to breathe from severe covudu with 105 fever coughing my guts out with previous lungs   heart issues begging them for oxygen but being told vaxx first then treatment. at 2am i was ready to die but at home not surrounded by money hungry vultures so i checked myself out and called my son to come get me. in california under normal circumstances the hospitals are required to give necessary care to all patients but...i m still alive because i chose to follow my god given instincts and get out of there.
god bless you patriot nurse. semper fidelis
you had me till the end
funny you should say  window dressing  because that s how i describe  to my wife  the way er s   icu s look today vs twenty years ago. sometimes i ll describe it as  gilded . it looks all high tech but there s very little substance when compared the level 1   2 trauma centers of yesteryear. while i may poke fun and reminiss about the  good ole days  there s really nothing funny about it. i don t have the words to describe how serious this is. i can t even trust that my wife would get competent emergency medical care if she were in a car accident and care flite had to take her to what nowadays passes as a level 1 or 2. blood is always required for these things. but do you trust the system enough to receive blood  because i sure has hell don t. and i used to do this stuff for a living.
@watchmansmitty1  it s sad but true. if people just knew how little time they spend cleaning a room before the next patient goes into that room  they would truly be shocked. and yes  i have personally witnessed errors with patient blood collection. it all stems from the modern-day model of rack  em and stack  em.
what star
good blessed guts and brains
i keep refusing to get a primary and i don t dare do wellness checks for my kids anymore. i don t know how to find a trustworthy pediatrician. i m guessing if you re still working then you re still pushing the jab. how does anyone know if they are willing to critically think while being compassionate to their patients. i just keep praying nothing happens to my kids that requires us to visit the er. i gave up on graduate school  and decided to just go full time with my kids  homeschool etc. fortunately i have some knowledge in nutrition  and i am a gaps certified. the universities have been infiltrated anyways. a lot of woke nonsense. body positivity movements and climate crisis scare tactics has everyone wanting to go vegan while ignoring obesity. so the idea of  health  has changed anyways. my interest was mental health  sparked by my daughter s four year long fit turning out to be undiagnosed celiacs. mental health has always been behind the times  but the obstacles are even higher now. i don t have the patience to wait for the mental health field to catch up to nutritional psychiatry. but... it doesn t really matter anymore now. the jibby jabs will cause more neurological damage than any metabolic disorder. keep doing what you re doing. we need supporters like you. god bless.
i am not going to say that i am smarter than any doctor  but i will say that my body is smarter than every doctor.  given the right conditions  your body will heal itself.  and usually that condition is to feed your body correctly  with all the right foods and elements  and has little to do with the medical industry.  the unfortunate reality is that people have lost the skills to care for themselves  as society has convinced everyone that you cannot live without health insurance and a family doctor.  my company health plan is always going up in price  and they tell us it is because people are using it for everything.  in other words  no one is attempting to treat themselves.  i have talked to co-workers that take their kids to the er for a sniffle  basically.  this is why they were able to stuff obamacare down our throats  and tell us that healthcare is a right  not a privilege.
i get my yearly health check and a mammogram but if they did find something serious. i would get a second opinion and then get my affairs in order.
you are absolutely darling and wise. i love your delivery and expression
years ago i went to a new dentist when i started a new job. she said i had advanced gum disease.she wanted to do a painful deep cleaning. i had 0 symptoms. i went to the clinic where i had my last apmt 6 mos prior to this and asked them  how could this develop in 6 months   i went to get a second opinion and they confirmed she lied.
seems like most child doctors are above parents being bossy. can also be hard to find a good adult doctor that listens and runs the tests. the blood work always looks fine. but you know you re not fine. oh  well. here s a pill.
i had a great pa. had to move so starting the process.
back when barry obama got his  health care reform  passed   the gp dr i had asked me the  firearm  question   but in a way that could be misunderstood as small talk .... he asked  you do any hunting       what kind   deer or duck   my answer was  i don t see how that is relevant to my health visit!
thank you.  i feel late to the party  i am now subscribed.  i will join the ranks of the 522 000 other rather intelligent human beings which are subscribed.  i have some catching up to do now.  god bless.

in my opinion the bible is a compilation of knowledge of the environment  animals  humans and everything associated with them.  i suppose it was compiled over thousands of years of empirical observations of every sort concerning every aspect of life humans could observe.  to me it is a good guide book as to what to do and what not to do.
every time you say  experimental  my brain is screaming planned murder  not experimental.
you always tell these public officials  you are the beneficiary of the cqv trust.  if you merely give them your name and ssn  they will treat you with disrespect  mark you down as the trustee  liable party- debtor .  all medical bills are prepaid by your cqv trust.  when they send you a statement  you sign the back with  by  first-middle  last  beneficiary    the statetment is not a true bill.
in the er they should be more compassionate. we can choose what we need.

patriot nurse  what is the state of chemotherapy today  my daughter is stage three uterine cancer and is refusing to have chemo therapy or radiation therapy. i don t know which way to encourage her to go. she s 54.
very good video!
when was the hippocratic oath retired   the expression  first do no harm  is a popular phrase often attributed to the hippocratic oath taken by doctors. the idea is that it may be better to do nothing rather than intervening and causing more harm than good. when the hospital-associated doctors offered absolutely no advice for self-care and refused out-patient treatments of any kind during covid  they actually lost our trust forever.
you must also understand that just because the person sitting in front of you is a medical provider does not mean that that person up with the latest data a lot of times they are just repeating the talking points that they have been given especially if they are associated with any large hospital system
we miss all great nurses...
healthcare is a commodity. i espouse that every opportunity i get when people crow about it being a  right .
beautiful message!!! i ll tell you  my faith in yeshua and following god s sabbath  commandments and feast days has kept me in psalm 91 and deuteronomy 28!!! yah s blessings  prayers  love and shalom y all
sort of got what you re saying the problem we believe is if you say to a person your chances of dying are really increased unless you have this magic pill then most people are going to take the magic pill so really it comes down to what you think and whether you fear dying if you don t fear dying then you ve no worries if you do fear dying then you are going to run into trouble and you are going to take whatever they say.so bottom line is don t worry about death so much.
your menorah warms my heart.
are you planning to come to virginia this year  my mom and i want to train with you!
so . that may ask  are you up to date .  but can t they see our records anyway and they re just asking to pretend to find out from us
i love the bible references. god is in control. we just have to trust him. especially now
i will take my chances on a witch doctor before i ever see a doctor today. i do not fear death.
@10 06 candace owens gave a testimony on that  power tripping dynamic  in full effect on one of her podcast  my birth story . if anyone wants a very detailed explanation of what patriot nurse may be referring to  not candace s specific case but the ideology   i would invite people to check that out that story. i hope mentioning this doesn t get my comment banned.
having watched died suddenly on uncensored rumble  i suggest to prevent the weird protein strands from clogging us up  we take a 81mg child aspirin daily along with having vinegars especially apple cider vinegar and garlic. all to serve as  pipe cleaner .thoughts and further suggestions
i feel so bad. i took my mom to the dr her health was bad but i took her to hospital and they said her body shutting down and talk me into hospice she was on it 7 years eariler and i took care of her she got better. i signed papers before i was finished signing wish i should never i ask god to forgive me. they convince me she was shutting down and would not give her pain meds. they gave her 4 shots and before i could say goodbye she was out and was out 7 days before she died. i miss her so much. i don t agree with health care. i want to depend on greatest healer. i have autoimmune disorder but don t trust medicine. trying to find a holistic help.
i did a paper on college  in the 80 s  on freud s nephew  ed bernaise. in new york did a commercial for cigarettes coupled with the women s suffrage movement. he had women pull a pack of cigarettes  lucky strikes  if i remember right.  from their garters  mega social shock  light the cigarette and hold it up like a torch. he started hundreds of thousands of women smoking  they really didn t before this.  and collected a percentages from the total sales. bernaise was a super dirtbag compared to his uncle.
god bless you!
there is a statute in all 50 states  which requires all who conduct business  using a fictitious name  or name not their own name  must first register with secretary of state and get a certificate of filing.  none of these public officials  health dept employees  governor  police  are registered. therefore  they are just unregistered actors. after you register your anc  you are legal with good standing and nobody can force their policy upon you  without full liability.
get this our daughter is an a p professor. the majority of the class exams are now online. of course she is against this but has no say. so what are the odds their text books are right beside them !  yes they still have to pass board but what a sham.
what do you call someone who got out of medical school with a c- grade doctor.not everyone with letters after their name should be trusted with sharp objects and controlled substances that will affect your life
excellent video.
awesome  thank you  i think i am falling in love you speak truth
should have run from a clinic that i brought one of my dogs to for parvo shot....i did not and the da2hppv vax has impacted her greatly.  i did not pay attention to alarm bells going off inside.  my vet does not give this one and does not know what in it particularly is different aside from it has a different additional hepatitis than a more standard dapp.  is it much more than hepatitis heavy impact  additives  or is the a modify rna component   i was concerned the impacting things seen in human arm meds into vet meds.  i don t know  but  this went very bad.
thank you for sharing.
you are becoming more beautiful  inside and out  everyday.
thank you for looking out for we the still free  people!!
beast system  showing it s true colors.
so how does one insure they don t get co-v tainted blood from a transfusion during surgery  i need a total hip replacement done and i ve been putting this surgery off for the last few years because no one has been able to answer this question for me.
this lady  yes  i m assuming her gender  is spot on.
thank you for the information
stay away for as much radiation as possible  keep phone away at night and wifi routers. turn them off and see if you notice any differents.
anyone saying you have just said a  conspiracy theory ..... tell them that is  hate speech  and they owe you an apology.
great advise but hard  because i have hot bottons and the past 2 years i let them know that the medical rules were broken big time .
my family doc wanted to prescribe a drug to lower cholesterol. i said no thanks-isn t there some kind of herb or natural thing i could take    she paused   was silent   then wrote on a scrap of paper  remaining silent  she handed me the scrap  it said    red rice tea . neither of us said anything i put that scrap of paper in my purse. unfortunately i was allergic to that tea and sadly she left.
absolutely ..listen to your gut instincts.
i would have to say  yes amen a 1000 times always for sure   your always high intelligence

not only smart but beautiful   thank you youtube you finally did something correct
as a nurse for 50 years and a follower of your channel i couldn t agree more.  i cannot in good conscience continue in my profession due to the govermental interference in the practice of medicine and nursing. i could write a treatise. however it would be much too long. a litany of abuses would only lead to more anger and bitterness. suffice to say that  the whole world lies beneath the sway of the evil one.  if you must seek care  first seek the great physcian in prayer and ask his guidance. also do your own research and homework and take responsibility for your own health and healing. i applaud those who voluntarily seek to help their fellow man without regard to remuneration. may god continue to bless and sustain them. you are doing god s work here and now.
what about z28.310 the new  diagnosis code  that really is about labeling those who politely said no thank you.    that is a horrible thing that i heard is already happening in charts across the board.
always rely on instinct.  it is 100  reliable.
thanks for the info.
you have the right to freedom of speech.  and because of this right  you have the right to tell your doctor  as well as the state  that you are refusing to swallow a pill  and or taking a shot  for any reason or for no reason at all.  your body  your choice.
medical tyrants must fall.
that intuitive sense is the light of christ.
well  considering the state indoctrination system  read schools  we don t know how to take care of ourselves... people have given up responsibility of their kids and the kids grew up and gave away the responsibility to take care of themselves to the government.
amen girl....
i prefer the holistic approach and will only use medication as a last resort  emergency or extreme pain . are there holistic doctors  if there are holistic doctors  are there health insurance companies that cover holistic doctors  or do i have to fit the western medicine mold  the reason i ask is because i do pay health insurance that s there in case of emergency. i don t use it because i don t agree with doctors pushing jabs  toxins  and so-called preventative measures tests down my throat. i want to be able to just get labs  get  an explanation of my results  and adjust my nutrition and or exercise schedule if necessary. i feel like i am being robbed by paying into insurance that i am not using for preventative care. i should have options and not have to fit a mold or follow one health standard.
thank you for sharing.. i haven t seen your videos in quite a while!.. love to you
i prefer dental care in latin america. mexico  costa rica  and el salvador have treated me very well both in service  medical competency  and respect unlike the quacks here in the u.s.
in most states  doctors dentists have access to a database.it shows whether u got the jab   how many times  so u cant fib about it by name   address.that s how they issued covid cards.
alex jones was warning of this for a while now. thats why theyre silencing him. hes not the only one.

things have changed a lot for you even in the past 6 months. nice setting  nice clothes  doing conferences. cool. my mom used to say  they have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning of time . and i have found this to be so true. admittedly things are quite odd these days and i am happy to see this video more dated to the time instead of the table slamming style of  you re not ready . i guess i will check out a couple future videos to see if you stay on this path  and consider subscribing if you do. would love to see some practical application stuff. do you have a medical dummy you could do that with  i also notice you don t interact with your youtube comments much  so i won t expect a direct answer to that  but i will check out your stuff once in awhile to see.

thank you!!!
every time i go to a doctor  they always ask me if i have had shot x  or  y  or  z  and do i want one. i always tell them i havehad all the ones i want and think i need. doctors push pills no matter if the pills help or hurt. shots and pills and shots. ifyou took your car to a mechanic and he told you that your car needed a new transmission  you might check with some-one else for another opinion. all mechanics are not honest either.
alert the weight of these comments  y all  certainly proves beyond a shadow of doubt that the medical community has utterly betrayed the collective trust of its patient community  who at one time  truly loved and respected their service.
you should talk abt this in a talk show.
herbal and natural medicine knowledge was passed on through what we might call medicine women and men  through observation   experience   trial  and use. it s based on the natural sciences   not on medical  industry   science  . find reputable people in your community who practice this  as most people need guidance  at least initially.  those who use herbs  ultimately do develop an intuitive sense of what works for them . medical doctors have never studied herbal therapeutics   it s safe to say  so they have zero experience to opine.
thank you !
i don t know jack squat about medical stuff  but the way the jab was forced on us gave me pause.  i m still paused in 2023.  purebloods unite!
thumbs up and subscribed!
strangely  i got a text from my southwestern state s health department saying their records show i haven t had my annual flu shot. they gave the usual persuasion about keeping my family and community safe. i found it creepy that they knew who had shots and that they had the nerve to send me an unsolicited text! it ended with telling me to let them know when i got it so they could update their records

is it necessary for kids to have well child visits  my son is 11 and we haven t been since his pediatrician and i ended up in a yelling match and me  towing my son  walking out of the clinic  all because i told her that we would not get the shot  that we believed it was killing people. her response was  they haven t proven those deaths were from the vaccine.  it got heated pretty quickly. anyway  unless i suspect a problem  are those  well child visits  necessary  is there a reason why i would need to take him in if he s healthy
sooooo off topic  but that sweater!  it s stunning on you!
chuck missler described doctors medicine as a priesthood.
i strongly disagree with you about what you tell a doctor. they need to know  that you reserve the right of informed consent and will not tolerate being bullied. there are still real doctors out there. it is amazing what not being afraid to tell at them will accomplish.
wow  what a sorry state of affairs. to have to approach a care provider with suspicion and wariness.
thank you for this video!  btw nice menorah!
the velocity of money measures the number of times that the average unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. the concept relates the size of economic activity to a given money supply  and the speed of money exchange is one of the variables that determine inflation.
remember that a  d  is a passing grade in med school  too.
patriot nurse  with respect  i disagree with you on adhd medications. from age 5-16 i was medicated for adhd. i restarted the medication in 2020 and my life is much better now  my career is taking off and i m now married. before 2020 my life was a chaotic nightmare. the right meds at the right dose is a godsend.
good job! thanks!
i highly recommend to people looking to immigrate to my country  canada  that they reconsider not especially because of the failed health care system and the plethora of politically driven so-called  professional health care providers  even though our system is rife with these types  but the entire milieu of lunatic left beliefs up here with regard to health care  the economy  and our authoritarian government. our government is increasingly looking to solve medical problems  cut bureaucratic costs and reduce economic problem children  with their maid  medical assistance in dying  policies.  they are pushing medical assisted suicide on veterans suffering from ptsd. it s bloody barbaric. i m a sixty-four year old ex-military man and i have been without a family doctor for almost a decade now. when i am in need of medical services i have to resort to what we call walk-in clinics - industrial medicine - where what i say is ignored  i m patted on the head and given a prescription for medication that they are unwilling to explain what the pill is supposed to do or what the potential side-affects might be and then told to be on my way. the last time i saw a doctor it was to have a cut on my finger stitched - the so-called doctor did not know how to freeze the finger and after multiple jabs with a syringe i told him to just get on with the stitching. he even managed to screw that up by pulling so tight on a stitch that he pulled it out trying to tie it off. i d be better off going to the veterinarian who looks after my livestock. thankfully i am for the most part healthy and strong and have a bit of homeopathic information at my fingertips.
what   big brother knows best  right   i m so confused...no offence  but i ve been steering clear of  modern medicine  since realizing how disastrous the government s food pyramid played out  with the resultant obesity  diabetes and horrendous  accepted therapy for this affliction.  seems most physicians first  and only  response  is to prescribe drugs  and then even more drugs for the inevitable side effects.  of course  it can never hurt to order 101 tests  as long as the patient s insurance will cover them.
you are so right.  i am a registered
it is not a duty to consume. by our very nature we are consumers. we must consume water  food  clothing  housing  transportation and energy to survive from day to day. our natures as consumers is exploited by different groups  yes  but we are not exploited into being consumers. we are naturally consumers.

i first started to take umbrage at your advice.  as a nurse of 34 years and an army medic nurses aid for 9 years before that  i was thinking...i interview patients every day as a home health nurse.  i do not look at them like you say....ah  but i do.  but here s the difference.  i advocate for folks that want to choose a path that is less than healthy.  i tell them  it s their right to make unhealthy decisions.  my job is to offer the information and let them decide.   i admitted a gentleman who by all accounts is an alcoholic  at age 50  has been on disability since age 23  lives in squalor  has his late 70 s mother wait on him and refuses to get off his behind which of course  because he doesn t wash himself  is now excoriated and yeasty and painful.  he was given the information on how to relieve this condition  but he never even heard me.  he continuously interrupted my education and explanation. he repeatedly told me he  only sips  alcohol and in the background his mother says sotto voce   one and a half bottles every two days.   chain smokes.  so  yeah after trying for two hours to make headway with him....and reinjuring my own lingering bronchitis with his cigarette smoke  i m not going back.  we are dialing it in.  we ve told the doc he is not compliant.  he needs psychiatric help for decades before a difference will be made.  i can t help him help himself.  i certainly can t fix him and you know what  i m not gonna try anymore.  he did this to himself.  do i have compassion  of course.  emotional pain which causes alcoholism is just as relevant as physical pain.  but screw that.  and how do you find a physician that hasn t drunk the koolaid   how do you ask his office staff on the phone...is this doc gonna force me or harangue me to take the jab   are you all fully woke   how do i figure that out prior to the visit   cause if you have a solution  i am all ears. steve kirsch just published a newsletter with a list of docs that haven t drunk the koolaid.  it s maybe 30 docs across the country.  cripes.  there has to be more than that. i m disgusted with the world.  and beleaguered.  between working with bronchitis for two months and now a partially avulsed intercostal muscle  i just don t care anymore.  if you are interested in getting better  i will share my suggestions and experience.  otherwise  i m dialing it in. you get the minimum and i m moving on.
most  doctors  will not discuss side effects. it makes them angry to just ask them.
if there were to be a nuclear war for real  and  if we knew about it several hours or days in advance  the first thing they would do would be evacuate our bombers and fighters from the air force bases  since those are prime targets.  fuel tanker planes and cargo planes also. they would have to close down civilian airports  some  not all   chase out the travellers or at least get them out of the way  and put the civilian airliners to the side or fly them to other airports.  then they can try to hide air force planes in civilian hangers.  the excuse could be a computer glitch to the air traffic control system   like what was just trained for a few days ago  or anything else.  then our military aircraft of all sorts could fly in and out as needed.   once an enemy from spies or satellites figured out which airports were being used this way  the secondary air force bases would switch to roads.  big freeways or state highways that are flat and level for half a mile  two miles  even more.  these would be roads with no trees or poles or signs on the edge  since you don t want anything to shear off airplane wings.  you would see blockades   get off the road because there is a chemical spill ahead  or a terrorist    and also people would not be allowed to access the onramps.  even offramps would likely be guarded.  it might be the police or highway patrol  but especially if you see guys in military uniforms shutting down big flat roads you have a clue things are getting close to nuclear war.if you see any of these signs  it is time to immediately get 20 miles away or more  and find a big deep hole.  better have a 2-3 week supply of food  water  and toilet paper with you.  maybe warm clothing  and a radio with plenty of batteries would be essential.

yahshua - you know him as jesus - was born to a virgin  turned water to wine  taught  healed the sick  raised the dead  casted out demons  walked on water  calmed the storm  and fed a crowd of thousands with a few fish and a few loaves of bread on two separate occasions  among many other things. he was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind  three days later he rose from the dead. forty days later he ascended into heaven where he sits at the right hand of the father. he is returning very soon  but before he does  satan  the devil  is coming to pretend to be jesus god  2 thessalonians 2 1-4 and revelation 2 10 . satan is an angel  and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. he will  for example  be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. he will only be on earth a short time before the real king of kings  jesus christ  god in the flesh  returns. when the real jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on his precious name!if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus  and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead  thou shalt be saved. - romans 10 9now when jesus was in bethany  in the house of simon the leper  there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment  and poured it on his head  as he sat at meat. but when his disciples saw it  they had indignation  saying  to what purpose is this waste  for this ointment might have been sold for much  and given to the poor. when jesus understood it  he said unto them  why trouble ye the woman  for she hath wrought a good work upon me. for ye have the poor always with you  but me ye have not always. for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body  she did it for my burial. verily i say unto you  wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world  there shall also this  that this woman hath done  be told for a memorial of her. - matthew 26 6-13seek ye the lord while he may be found  call ye upon him while he is near  let the wicked forsake his way  and the unrighteous man his thoughts  and let him return unto the lord  and he will have mercy upon him  and to our god  for he will abundantly pardon.be ye also patient  stablish your hearts  for the coming of the lord draweth nigh.to anoint your self  the sick  or a building for spiritual protection get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. use the rest of the bottle for cooking. ask the lord to bless your vial of oil in jesus name. anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead  and ask the lord to bless you heal you. to anoint your home or other building  place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house  and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering  order it  to be so in the name of jesus. anoint all potential entrances to your home. to anoint the sick  place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in jesus name. see james chapter 5 14-15. .
holy cr p they actually allowed a nurse to speak the truth
mam  i discern that you have the spirit of the most high god dwelling within your temple  you have not allowed it to be defiled by a  gene hacking false doctrine of a fake snake bite jab and that gut instinct you refer to is the holy spirit of god dwelling within your temple. may god bless you and keep you and cause his face to shine upon you amen.
is it just me or did you forget to put eye liner on your left eye  it s distracting me from the video. i ve got ptsd from deployments so it doesn t take much for that to happen lol. beautifully smart as usual though! appreciate the videos  eventhough i don t get many alerts to your videos like i used to get .thanks to the algorithm to throttle and shadow ban videos that are pro-god  anti-forced medical procedures  etc etc etc. keep up the good fight and educating us!!god bless
started a new provider  since we moved and now on medicare  thank goodness he didnt push any jabs!!!
seems like organized religion plays the same game....  your a  good boy  as long as you accept the concept that the education of the clergy is what is going to lead you to salvation.. con artists predominate in both fields  me thinks ...
i m so glad i did not get the serum. i m very happy they did not try and make me do it cuz there would have been people very unhappy
amen brother
great job  thankyou
my doc always seems to send me to specialist.
that doesn t solve all problems
true
no false
i m not sure i follow. you re there voluntarily. i ve also never heard that concept taught in any church. successful cons are usually more clever than that but yeah they exist.
@scottdegenhardt599  yeah but most churches are good churches
@debihester7284 church   replacement theology.   this is the dispensation of the church.    proof  ask a church member about the reference text  bible  history narrative.  they do not understand 2 tribes vs 10 vs 12 tribes of israel.  it s a house of cards. sorry
@613kc  there are good books on this topic  though i m sure you wouldn t read them because a random schmuck on youtube said so. in short  there is more to this than you think there is and it is not evidence of a house of cards.
excellent!
just curious who here that has had a battle with c has had the neuropathy   numbness in the arms and face
great video
thanks patriot nurse
you are right. right away i get did you have your covid shots   also at one doctor s office the questions were being asked i mentioned in some way that i had had anxiety about something but your talking just normal healthy worry nothing bad.   but now i have on record i agreed to having anxiety.. can i get this removed from my records.           this makes me mad!!!! also i have some medications down i have never taken....... i don t do medications i like all natural herb products.  my mom told me before she died at an old age said never tell them anything basically because of this.   lets face it everyone in the world has gone though some kind of worry or anxiety it s all part of life.   they make it sound like your nuts or something.   can i remove this from my medical record     thank you so much....
thank you pn.
good advice
you sound like my mom talking about us being consumers especially to me about my sister and brother in laws.
or didn t  afaik  and still had a medical target painted on his back  protocols which dropped on his head like a bank safe. rip my brother  apr 2022  stolen from us 43 years young.
i don t understand people that don t just say no to everything for the last 30 years or so.  i mean i don t even know where to begin with those kind of people. just say no to drugs. it s not that complicated just say no
wishing you a healthy  happy    prosperous 2023!
i went to get my prescription refilled and the pharmacy wanted to know if i was still using another medication that my doctor prescribed
thanks for the info
thank you so much
than you for the warning!
the scariest words ever spoken  i m from the government and i m here to help you
the behavioral and psychiatric drugs people  give their children oh my goodness.the horrible side effects.the surge in type 2 diabetics the population in the usa on blood pressure meds heart and cholesterol  meds insulin and diabetic meds anti psychotics..the list goes on and on.the line wraps around the pharmacy and it seems the majority of the nation is dependant on a med just to function daily.what will happen when those meds dry up and are unavailable  i believe it is going to happen.it is going to be sad.
well done
we have been weakened by original and actual sin. pray
absolutely!
thanks for the video i m booked for surgery next month scared shitless of getting jabbed under a general any pointers on what to do thanks for the advice on going along but it is very alarming knowing they will jab you under a general anesthetic
i m at the point is rather die at home vs go to a doctor or hospital.  no trust.
excellent video
be careful who you trust in the gov. industrial medical complex  get a second opinion always now that most doctor s have gone crazy
god bless you my daughter

don t ever take a pcr test.
yes! yes! yes!
thank you.
my  intuitive sense  told me not to take the jab.
we have constantly kept the system from vaccinating my 91 almost 92 year old mother

when i turned 65 my doctor handed me a piece of paper with a circle on it and asked me to draw in the face of a clock and to draw in the hands showing 11 10  ..then gave me some words to remember which they would ask me later to repeat  .i said what does this have to do with my appointment and she said it was required !  red flag!i had been given thyroid medication which i had been on for a couple of years and at this appointment she increased the amount because of the lab results.  i took that medication and in about 6 months i was even more exhausted  anxious  heart racing  cried at a moment s notice about nothing  nausea and felt like i didn t want to live  .then one day i just quit taking it   that day was the best day i had had in years  i later found out it was side affects from the drug.  it has been 7 months and i have way more energy then i have had in a very long time ..i wake up happy  energetic  have not cried in those 7 months and look forward to life.  so ..when i went for my appointment after not taking the medication the assistant flipped out.  didn t matter that i felt good  next thing i know they kept calling me to come back in to talk about it!  at this point i m done with them .never returned their call and not going back.   the other thing i had was high cholesterol  which i refused medication  and then i had to hear how i didn t trust her .another red flag.

talking to the dumbed down public is a challenge

@thepatriotnurse are you familiar with the flexner report that was funded by the rockefeller and carnegie foundations and how it was the catalyst for the fundamental shift in medical treatments towards pharmaceuticals and operations
no ne classes  any particular reason  is it just too bad up there wondering
you are so gifted!
shalom!
common sense is so uncommon now days.
medical assistant here  when people turn 65 yrs   they go see to see their primary doctor for their annual physical exam  one of the things the provider s medical assistant has to do is have that patient do several cognitive tests that check for any dementia  cognitive issues. it is just standard   could also be a health insurance related requirement.
thanks for your reply but i m just done with any medical doctors or treatments  ..i have absolutely no faith in any of them.  im sure they are good people but they have been lied to plus the insurance companies think they know what is best  i just love how our medical insurance premiums go up every year.  this year it increased 150.00 per month ..how grand is that in this economy where everything is overpriced and knowing that it s totally worthless insurance for stupid things like drawing a clock face and remembering a few words just because you turned 65!
@maryadkins4619  i get it! presently  i am looking for work. this week i went on an interview for a medical assistant position for a chiropractor office. i like the doctor   she seemed to be on board with no covid shot requirement for employment   so on. i have been seriously disillusioned in working in the medical field for multiple reasons including losing faith in many providers   how the healthcare system operates. if i don t get this job  i am going to take that as a sign from god that it is time to leave the healthcare field   find other type of work.
@amycopeland1701  will be praying for a job that respects you and your values.  thanks for taking your time to respond ..it s been a horrific awakening these last 2 years.  we are now on our own and we need to help each other.  people are hurting everywhere!
@maryadkins4619  i d find that offensive too! the nerve. i wouldn t be going back nor would i draw the silly clock.
happy new year. may god bless you.
yeah it s so difficult for me to .
i have prayed and prayed about the jab.  but never got the ok for it so i will not have it.   family tried to get me to take it but no way.   my si that kept wanting be to have it has passed away two weeks ago.
my cousin took expirmental medicine for years he was tortured with bone marrow and organ biopsies which he has to have done without medication . in the end they let him die he needed one needle to stay alive this medical abusers would not give him that  needle they were done with hum . he died begging for that needle
i m 75 i have not had covid  i have not had any covid shots  i live in the woods were my closest neighbor lives a quarter mile away
i came to the decision if i have to sit there and lie my ass off  i don t need this. unless i have an issue  i m not going.
nope i am very combative i don t let them have the high ground i tell them i m not going to be back i tell them that they re not practicing true medicine i don t take their medication i grew up in the family of eli lilly and company
you a beautiful woman  both in body and soul.

02 24 2023 hello teacher  nurse and best friend to all who deserve it. i am just now watching this. sorry. pearls  curls and a new brooch. cool. i trust the government more than the industrial doctors and hospital owners and operators. doctors have given up any pride by the insistence of the insurance co. people know about ike s warning about the military industrial complexes  but no one has warned any one about the health care industrial insurance complexes. now they have the control over all things medical  except for your funerals but they also are a nationwide conglomerant. so from birth to death we have someone mistreating us. sincerely don
stay away from the medical industry if you can.
wrong you go in and you let them know what you re going to take what you re not going to take what you re going to do what you re not going to do you take the high ground the hell with them and their system
i thought this w as a gene simmons interview by the thumbnail

the florence nightengale pledge  i solemnly pledge myself before god and in the presence of this assembly  to pass my life in purity and to practice my profession faithfully. i will abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischeivious  and will not take or knowingly administer any harmful drug. i will do all in my power to maintain and elevate the standard of my profession  and will hold in confidence all personal matters committed to my keeping and all family affairs coming to my knowledge in the practice of my calling. with  loyalty will i endeavor to aid the physician in his work  and devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care.i heard this in an anime  and was intrigued.  but look at us now...
no. profit has always been a part of the medical system. what has changed since the 1940s is the control aspect of medicine that has happened as a result of the government interventions in the medical economy.

health care don t you mean sick care
using gas ovens for heat in grid down emergencies  by  j.e. ante.during a winter grid down emergency your gas furnace will not work unless you have an electric generator and a home or furnace transfer bypass switch installed to use it.   most poorer people and apartment dwellers will not have any alternate means of heat in their homes or apartments.  but if they have a gas stove  they might be tempted to turn it on and open the oven door for heat.  this will result in gas fumes being breathed by the people which is extremely harmful.  but there are save ways to make use of gas oven heat and gas stove heat.one  is to use the stove top to make hot foods  soups  and beverages to eat and warm the body.  two  is use the stove top burners to make hot water and fill hot water bags or glass jars or thermos bottles to be placed next to your body for warmth.three  use the top burner to heat rocks in a pan to then wrap up in a towel to place next to your body for warmth.  heat your body not the room.fourth  fill your oven with bricks or cans of sand or rocks and turn the oven on to heat up these items for 30 minutes.  then turn off the gas oven and open the door to let out the heat into your home for the next hour or more.  keep doing this cycle to keep your kitchen warm and toasty and close off the rest of the house.  you can get even more heat if you have a small usb fan that runs on batteries which you place in or near the oven door to vent out the heat into the kitchen quicker. note   you must not use or run your oven with the door open because then you get fumes of co2 and carbon monoxide released into your home or apartment.  your gas oven does not isolate the heat from the burn box fumes like your gas furnace does.  so it is not safe to run your oven with the door opened.  if you do not have a gas stove or oven you can use candles to heat rocks or hot water in a jar to be placed next to your body wrapped in a towel.  most all heat from a candle is totally useless because is rises to the ceiling and does no good there.  but you can make use of this candle heat if you heat rocks  sand  or water in jars to be place next to your body.  heat your body not the room if you have only very limited heat in winter in a grid down situation.  if you have no candles go outside and make a fire with tree branches to heat rocks  sand  and or hot water for jars to take inside.  heat your body not your room when heating resources are limited. -- j.e. ante.

it is so so sad  reducing highly skilled real doctors doctors  that know the principle not to harm as no1importance  to bind these good doctors intoone sided pharma sales generating protocols.this is poor and bad science. good doctors inpoorest countries are sometimes in the goodsituation  to help double  trice efficient thantheir wealthy rich colleagues.
nice haircut
this j w is right

sorry but i know people that are as healthy as a thoroughbred  and have never seen anyone from the medical industry.  when medicine became big business  healthcare went down the toilet.
they ain t pumping that crape in me or mine
this size and reach of the federal gov t we see today is a direct result of the expansion that occurred during wwii.  the war effort concentrated the power in dc and that power never went back to the states and local govt s.  you can go to dc today and see all of the buildings that were built during that era. office buildings that literally go on for blocks and blocks. the war changed the collective mindset of the american people to place trust in people authority figures as a matter of survival.  questioning these authority figures publicly would but a person in a situation where they were seen as being un-american because they were not supporting the war effort. this was a direct product of the propaganda machine that was being used at the time on the american public. this mass media propaganda machine is alive and well today doing all the same things it did over 60 years ago.  the goal is not to influence or convince all the people but the vast majority so the herd can be shifted and manipulated.  the product of this is known as pop culture and the news cycle. created  manicured  and served to you on a platter for your consumption.
i respect my own intuition and avoid doctors and anything resembling the medical industrial complex.  listening to my intuition allowed me to avoid an unnecessary hysterectomy.  do your own research.  the medical profession is strictly about        .
say no first ....

the heads of the medical establishment who pushed crimes against humanity belong to the religious ethnic tribe you promote  it s time to think harder.
free yourself with the teachings of godly ict on youtube . or dont  its up to you  i dont care.
ty
there is no such thing as smart....every practicioner at some point needs to take a leap of faith when they trust their supplier......either they are lazy.....dont understand the medical field or you simply dont have the time for to do their own research.....and the moment you take that leap of faith you have lost control and you are a glorified sales representitive...
most people in america aren t going to understand the vocabulary you re using. most americans won t know the meaning of commoditizing. they probably won t know beneficent  if you used the word beneficial instead  they probably would know that.  they probably won t understand  the alphabet culture.  a huge number of americans are not above the fourth grade reading level and vocabulary.  do you think you could remake this video and bring down the vocabulary  i m an english teacher and i can attest that this is true from talking to my students and their parents.
all along  i thought you were a follower of christ and not jewish.
ridiculous
what
its time for socialized medicine   it cant be worse than what we have . we are already paying for it .
hey. single !
when did you convert to judaism
so glad i didn t listen to the garbage science. pureblood
i love and respect your workbut i can t understand  you being such a patriotwhy you are a zionist
if you think they re telling you what to do now  wait until there s socialized medicine. it can be worse!!!
@tolik5929  what do you propose i should be doing
@janedough6575  for one   put the doctors back in charge of medicine   and not the insurance companies . that would be a good patial start .
@tolik5929  well that s how it was when i was growing up. then when clinton was president they made everyone s healthcare tied to their job. i personally have avoided the medical industry since 1997 due to experiences i had.
