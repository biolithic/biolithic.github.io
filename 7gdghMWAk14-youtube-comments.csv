i never regret listening to you but! i literally almost shed a tear listening to you today. i value being a modest  traditional woman and i know  respect and appreciate the position elohim made me for. thank you for your voice and commitment to this subject.
honoring a woman  1 . opening doors for her  2 . giving her your seat on a full bus  3 . acknowledging her presence with a slight bow or tip of the hat  4 . making sure she goes first in all situations where harm is absent  5 . speaking up for her honor  6 . respecting her procreative abilities and showing her such.  6 . common sense actions to let her know you re pleased that she s a woman.  and many other  old fashioned  forms of etiquette.
you are an incredible woman. i ve watched your evolution over the years since you lost your husband. your strength  motivation  femininity and faith deserves recognition.anyone who has you as a friend is blessed.
i m not a bleeder. i m not a chest feeder. i am not a womb person. i m not a birthing person. i am a woman! i ve always been a woman . i embraced  my femininity  my role as a mother  a wife and partner. as my children grew older i worked outside the home when i was beyond my ability to have children but i still also maintained my position of mother and wife. i jiggled schedules but it worked. i have great productive children and now grand children. made my life complete. i am a woman.
it s the women like you that make us guys appreciate women so much!
just like herseys put a transgender person on their product to represent women on international woman s day. i actually sent them an email stating my feelings about this and informed them i will no longer purchase their products.
i m 51 with grown children that i love dearly  and a husband of 33yrs that i would feel lost w o i agree 100  with everything you said. the  femanist femanazi  movement has already done enough damage. being a femanist means hating the men in your life  and i love all the men in mine my husband  son brother dad  uncles  nephews there is no way i would ever go along with that. i m sorry  but i see them as nothing more than man hating baby killers w  bad hair  they are disgusting.
my favorite young lady on the interweb. all woman. all patriot.
i must say to you ms. patriot nurse that you are undoubtedly one amongst the very few proponents that we have for true patriotism under divine law and you are a unwavering vessel of hope that not only america needs but the entire world. so much experience and wisdom from one amazing woman. those who will listen need your voice. keep fighting the good fight beloved!
just forwarded this to my wife.  i was recently asked what i considered a strong woman  i think femininity is the ultimate strength of a woman who knows how to cultivate and embrace it.
nothing but pure respect for you.a lot of young women out there in this world need to hear this. dare i say a lot of men too!!!
you got it sister. a big thumbs up. we need more just like you today.
thank you patriot nurse for your commentary and common sense! you re a breath of fresh air! some women need to understand god created us differently to complement each other not to compete with each other. thank you again.
as a man and american patriot it is always good to hear the perspective of a woman american patriot. and in this case on the subject of women. thank you and godspeed to you.
i gave up when i got screamed at and called every name in the book for holding the door for a woman with a ankle boot on. i was so confused because my mom taught me when i was little to respect and honor women and to protect them and treat them gently and with love and care. i still believe this and i try my best but as a disabled person with severe ptsd i was just so confused and i just don t want any problems so i m sorry but i had to stop. i feel so bad but every time i go to instinctively go grab for the door i have to stop myself. if this is the result they wanted i guess you got it because i respect women but i don t want any problems so i just don t do it anymore. i m not saying i m one of   the good guys  but i like to think of myself as one and i ll be honest the whole feminist movement seems so counterproductive  but hey what do i know. god bless everyone. much love.
i couldn t have said it better myself. i broke with the feminist mindset while in my 20s  since it didn t take me long to understand it allows for the abuse and devaluing of women. god bless you for speaking out on this.
so encouraging! always pointing to god. this is why i love your videos.   3
thank you patriot nurse for standing up on what is righteous and just! it is refreshing to see an strong american woman call a spade a spade. by the way  your laughter was really cute  peace and blessings to you and yours in jesus name.
hello  thank you for this video i wish there were more women to stand up and speak out
i raised 5 children .. a blended family . i always felt shamed by most people.
@jamesbond-so1of  lol bond james bond shaken not studded. clown lol
my man is well fed but if it makes you feel better to give me a direct order  go ahead.
@rebeccalynntenbrink6254  you make him sound more like he is your possession. your man or your husband  shalom.
@barryrammer7906  in recent years  i thought james bond was a comedy  just like borat. the most recent james bond  another weffy jb  was waddling like a duck instead of walking or running.
@mtl  lol food for thought very nice thank you about jb. i could care less. i m just trying to comfort a poor woman here who s losing her sanity in today s society. just trying to encourage her that we men have her back she s not alone and should not shed a tear over these idiots today.
@mtlicq  sean connery is the only james bond i have ever liked.
@shittshots  shalom  i was mocking his original comment. certainly not my possession.
@jamesbond-so1of  no harm  no foul. i m not easily offended. all good sir.
she rocks!
how dare you. as a non binary   whatever that is  i take offense. don t ask me to explain why  cause the system has completely failed  me and my whole generation . save the clock tower!! save the clock tower!!!
honoring a man.  respecting his mind  his person and his opinion.   learning to cook  in order to feed him properly and give him sustenance. keeping in shape    trim  so that he can feel physical and psychological release. keeping the home clean  and free from chaos  so when he comes home  he can feel the weight of the world fall from his shoulders.  just my 2 cents. g-d bless you.
i don t need  demand  or expect that. but it is very sweet and i appreciate it when it does happen! i can t tell you how many times i ve struggled with a laundry cart trying to open a heavy door like the ones at the train station and have seen people  both men and women  just stand there watching me. is it that much effort to hold a door open for a few seconds  when you re standing right there !funny story. i was at church. i had gotten there late  so i was standing in the back. i actually don t mind standing for the whole service. i ve had back pain stiffness from typing for so many years. standing is often a relief. there was a stack of chairs nearby. from the corner of my eye  i saw a man taking one. for a moment  i thought it was for me. nope. it was for himself. i ll give him the benefit of the doubt. maybe he didn t even see me. but it did give me a chuckle.
@spottheborgcat6523  if i had one  i would. my main problem is... i can t cook to save my life. but if i had someone  i would be willing to learn.
@yesica1993
no woman wants all that bullshit. that s going overboard. super cheesy
@jerrythomas4457  i assume you are speaking only for yourself  of course.
yes!!! no need for materialist things  just hqve courtesy and respect. whenever my husband and i go anywhere   rare  he opens the car door and every other door for that matter  pulls chairs out  and will ask if i want him to draw me a bath every night it is so amazing that even when i am angry at him i would never think of leaving. we have been together almost 13 yrs.
@barryrammer7906  thank you.
@rebecca lynn tenbrink  your welcome. have a blessed day.
agree but am troubled as a christ follower fla marq calling you a prophetess   are you call him out for christs sake for truths sake even if in private
that was a awesome comment sister rebecca . praise jesus christ the most high   the name above all names !!!
@gilly714  thank you  absolutely brother
@donnamoss7480  prophet ess     a person  female   regarded as an inspired teacher or proclaimer of the will of god..... how am i wrong
@scotttovey  how do you know he s her husband  she did not call him her husband. i never said the word christ. you might want to re-read what she wrote and what i wrote.
@shittshots   how do you know he s her husband  she did not call him her husband. maybe i figured that you knew her well enough to make the following statement.taketheride1 day ago  edited  @rebecca lynn tenbrink  you make him sound more like he is your possession. your man or your husband  shalom.and she didn t correct you.
@scotttovey  she did not answer me. i made a statement and then i asked her a question. i m not sure why you would assume that two people know each other on the internet when you certainly do not know me and you ve never asked me a question.  would i ask her if it was her man or her  husband  if i knew her  if i knew her  i would have already known the answer. love the scripture you posted  yet my question was to her and not you.
@rebeccalynntenbrink6254  so do you believe in the name of yhwh and yahusha or do you believe in the false names of god and jesus christ. there is one name above all names  one name each for the father and the son. you cannot have it both ways my dear. look up the scripture about being lukewarm...  if you be lukewarm i will spit you out.  if you read the preface of your bible  at least it kjv  before the book of genesis  it will tell you the true names right there and that the true names were substituted out and falsified. please do not be lukewarm on this matter  when you have been told the truth.
@scotttovey  shabbat shalom by the way  this is the seventh day  the sabbath day.
@shittshots  i do believe in the name yhwh and yeshua! what makes you think i m lukewarm
@scotttovey  @taketheride  when i commented and i said  my man  i was mocking a comment made directing me to  get in the kitchen and make my man a sammich  to which i replied my man is well fed. the man i m referring to is not my husband. men are not possessions. but i cook for many as it pleases me to do so. hope this clears some things up.
@shittshots   shabbat shalom by the way  this is the seventh day  the sabbath day. i am aware of that fact.
@rebeccalynntenbrink6254   when i commented and i said  my man  i was mocking a comment made directing me to  get in the kitchen and make my man a sammich  to which i replied my man is well fed. i didn t see that post.that s one reason i have made it an imperfect habit to quote what i am responding too. if someone deletes their post  they can t make me look like i m talking to a ghost. the man i m referring to is not my husband. men are not possessions. but i cook for many as it pleases me to do so. hope this clears some things up. if he is your husband  he is yours and you have that piece of paper giving you legal standing to say he is yours. he can t simply walk away and be free  he has to go through a legal process to sever the ties. that sounds like ownership and possession to me.
@yesica1993   he must not have noticed you!   that s my hope anyway!
@yesica1993   bet you would learn to cook quite well.  and you would take great pleasure in your accomplishments!
@jerrythomas4457   sorry i think most real women would appreciate being treated like a lady deserves to be treated!  not saying smother her just respect her!
also  allowing  protecting  and respecting our need for privacy in bathrooms-real men still do that  the new crowd is oblivious.
all of the above! i sincerely appreciate your words  as they are my values. my former husband and i raised our son to be mindful of all that you said.   he demonstrates them regularly.
i agree with you.  however  women s liberation has erased every one of those points that you made clear.  this is what you wanted ladies  equal but separate.  welcome to the twenty-first century.
and a decent woman will return that respect five-fold.
@trid2bnrml149  agreed  but there are none that will do that anymore.
@jerry-yc2gt  i do.
chivalry is dead. women killed it.i don t open drs for women. i rush in   hold the dr closed    make her fight me for it. that way she feels good about defeating the patriarchy. just being considerate of her feelings.
but you need to do the opposite for a feminist or you re likely to get hollered at and or hit. the trick is being able to tell the difference  so here s a hint. a traditional female will have a kind look in her eyes and a smile on her lips. a feminist will have an angry look in her eyes and a puckered frown on her lips. a traditional female will dress conservatively  a feminist may even dress like a man  but nothing she wears will be feminine. so good luck out there and stay the course of being a gentleman.
as a woman that did not encounter this until i moved south  it scared me.  twenty years now  i appreciate it.  thank god for southern boys in teaching me how i ought to have been treated.
just read titus 2. it goes both ways. when you honor a woman according to titus 2  you honor god. and vice versa. any other way honors yourself.
@jerrythomas4457  christianity isn t for everyone.
@saintlunaticv3602  the road is narrow.
amen
@jerrythomas4457  i don t know whether you are male or female so i wont presume.  so please dont presume to  speak for all women.
@jerry-yc2gt  there are some.  more than you realize
@catherinehazur7336  good morning .  don t get me wrong    i love it when a woman acts  speaks  and dresses like a woman should.  a woman being feminine is wonderful.  it s the militant feminist  movement  that is distasteful.
@barbarabaumgartner1972  that s awesome  barbara!  thank you for sharing part of the secret to marital happiness  kindness and appreciation in a never ending circle.  overflowing  from hearts grateful to god  the creator and sustainer   for his many blessings.
@lylecoglianese1645  i had a big fear of cooking.  but i turned to god for wisdom and understanding on how to do it  and he turned me into a creative cook.  so he can help you too in practical ways  he s closer than hands and feet.
@jerrythomas4457  may be old fashioned and i do not expect it  because i m able to do but it is still nice!!!!
@yesica1993  so why didn t you  take one from the stack as well
@boblack1774  how dare you! as a trynary  i ll try and nary they come up with  i m offended that you want to save the clock towers  that is racist and homophobic and just mean.   how did we get to this point   there are 2 sexes. if someone wants to live as the other gender  then let them  but don t force their beliefs on me. i ll treat you with respect if you do the same.
@goawaynow-iz3du  you are stereotyping now.  sounds like you have bought into the identity politics propagandizing that categorizes people and stereotypes them according to superficial criteria that may or may not have any truth to it.  on what basis do you buy into this  how many  southerners  and  northerners  do you actually know as people  are you just regurgitating hateful stereotypes  that you decided to go along with for some unknown reason
absolutely
the more dates i go on as a 42yr old born male yankee in the south  i hear of men not having any manners whatsoever. i m shocked but then again i was raised to be a true gentleman. on the flip side  i always come in last. perhaps i should be ruder.
how did she lose her husband
@robinham2796  she lost her fiance. never married.
now that s a woman that s equal to any man. you did your share and probably more. i couldn t survive without my woman. it s not 50 50 it 100 percent on both sides.
jiggy- jiggy
i want more women who make a positive impact on the larger society other than just being a brrod mare.    we need more deborahs  yaels  esthers   the patrons   supporters of the new testament who went above   beyond the role of merely having children - nearly anyone can do that.women need to be bold enough to change the culture towards a positive direction   simply having kids isn t cutting  especially when you look at the american church with its pants down around its ankles - obsessed with material wealth   possessions  while christians outside the west are actually suffering   dying for their faith - all while having kids of their own as well.the west s lampstands are being removed from them for not heeding the warnings in revelation   the church is receding   destroying itself as a result - unless the churches go back   embrace the lessons of the lampstands.
not hershey!!  that s sad because i enjoy their chocolate   my support will go elsewhere
@deeladybug2618  it s true  i ve seen the bars of chocolate already in stores spelled out  her shes  and they re in the usual brown wrapper or in a white one with that writing and a transgender man posing as a woman on them. i ll never buy hershey s chocolate again. i ve not been buying them much anyways since they took their manufacturing jobs to mexico instead of america. basically saying to us that they re good enough to take our money but don t think we re good enough to have as employees. we need to start doing this to every business outsourcing our jobs or pushing this woke garbage nonsense. not another penny!
i stopped buying hershey years ago  because they have the grainiest chocolate.  now  of course  i will make it a point to speak against them.
@appalachianwoman561  and please let them know why.
@jeepstergal4043  i stopped even thinking about it when they moved manufacturing to mexico.
@deeladybug2618  they re guilty of so much more than a he-she bar! avoid their products always. same for nestle due to lack of care and concern for humanity! i boycott them as well.  the world we knew pre 9 1 1 will never be again but i wish i knew then what i know now! peace.
i will be doing the same. shame on hersey.
check out jeremy s chocolate.
starby s coffee company  promotes abortion among other things. we the people have the power to boycott.
@deeladybug2618  absolutely we should boycott.
did you just assume her gender
i so agree !!! i would follow her into battle
well said and my thoughts also!
well said
@debrafrei4717  thank you.
as a man  i now have a phobia of women in tents
@mtlicq  - it s the cowardly mentality of  men  that led to a tent setter saving the hebrew army.   p
@goawaynow-iz3du  understood  but its not a women vs men thing  nor a feminism vs men thing.  the bible is high resolution and has meaning in the big picture.  perhaps this was a microcosm god s wrath upon the more worldly superior invincible army that the men knew intelligently that it would be a waste  stupid if they even tried to fight the army that threatened the people of god  and similar to the divine strategies of marching around jericho playing trumpet.  bible says   not by might...sometimes its not cowardice.  would it be courage or would it be stupidity if a  real man  jumped in front of a train to stop the train from running over a kid or a pet  while it could be a better strategy to entice it to get off the tracks
@goawaynow-iz3du    on another note  yes sometimes we men  individuals can have moments of cowardice or simply lack of courage in our current times.  women too.  ...and some of it is bonafide lack of courage  and it is common. think of trying to make a new friend ...fear of rejection  fear of injustice   humiliation  fear of being manipulated  fear of being misinterpreted  even fear of success and things getting out of hand.  women can be  cowardly  lack confidence   courage  just as men also.
@mtlicq
i m so sorry to hear this!  but  please don t let the ugly in these ingrates keep you from the beauty in your heart.
i appreciate that type of respect and i ll hold the door for anyone who looks like they need help!
@patriotnurse2  could explain your comment further

i am sorry that happen to you . people should not of done that to you .
hold your head high.  you have nothing to feel shamed about.
why  baffles me how anyone has the nerve to judge when they have no clue. surround yourself with people that bring you joy and appreciate you for the person you are. not for who others think you shld be!
why shamed  you re a miracle worker!  you are amazing and deserve love   respect!
@godsrose1951  i mnot feeling ashamed now . i see through the narratives and programs from back then and now . at the time .. yes i was made to feel less ..
amen! from a woman  wife  mother  sister  nurse. loved by god almighty  saved by the blood of jesus. oh  i do not celebrate stupid days
beautiful and intelligent  thank you jesus for giving us this amazing woman  patriot nurse!!! god bless
although i am a man i cannot say enough of how grateful i am to hear and see a real woman like yourself and incredibly smart  common sense with such wisdom of the lord almighty you are. so rare the last real woman i saw with gifts like that was my mother and real man was my father but now  passed on and i am sure they are gone because they were very good people and very family oriented that which this evil world has stripped me of that now its like living with a brood of vipers and i say that with heavy heart and lots of love for them. thank god for christ jesus and his love that abides in us.
thank you. the confirmation i needed not to go insane today.
if i had a cocktail party to go to i d be playing this  just sayin
we raised six children  four bio kids from our marriage  and two more fost adopt. it worked out well but we encountered a lot of societal pressure from everywhere to be a two proffessional income household with no kids. when the kids were launched my wife took classes and went to work in healthcare.
pn  you always succinctly put into words the things i have been thinking for over 40 years.  thank you and god bless you!
i absolutely adore you and your wisdom  we need more intelligent conservative women like you. i truly miss the times when i was growing up because everything was so normal  unfortunately americans will never see those years again.
again  right on target! we are standing where the lord tells us to be! praying for your blessings and health everyday! keep up the great work!
this was absolutely great!!!
thank god for a woman like  patriot nurse  this precious lady knows and understands and most of all honors god in her life  marriage  and woman hood! she is a child of god first and foremost and is not buying into the liberal garbage being pushed by the demon possessed liberals of today! thank you pn for setting a standard and living that witness before mankind! praying for you and reid! keep up the good work!
you are exactly what a women should be so beautiful in every way every good  man in america      is looking for a women that has your spiritual intellectual and outer beauty traits i thank god for giving you to us  your information is transformational in every way
you have touched my heart more then once.  may the good lord watch over you and your family.    peace and love.
i worked  past tense  at a church preschool. i was saddened to see women  parents in general  dropping their children off by 7 a.m. and not picking them up until 5-5 30 pm  5-days a week. there s been a downfall of the family unit. women especially need to be there for their children  to raise them in the way they should go. i believe our society is in decay   this has been our govt s goal  to divided the family unit by sending men to war  putting the women to work outside of the home and it s become the norm  to put children at the age of 1 and 2 in preschool. light up shoes  top name brand clothing and fancy cars and homes  where you don t even grow your own food  should not be the priority. dare to be different  be set apart. teach your children well  csn y . i ask yahuah to change the heart of woman. shalom.
this may be the most important video you ve made.  clear  concise and true. may the lord bless and keep you.  thanks
you go girl! i m behind you ! i ve been a rebel my entire 55 years! don t tell me i can t do something because i ll prove you wrong g every time!! on the other hand the voice of my savior holds me under control thank you for this message. it s about time someone stands up for the true woman. the compassionate  loving  sensitive woman who lovers her place because the father put us there.
just want to say that i look forward to your videos. you are so well spoken  well educated and knowledgeable. to be honest  i admire you. as a physician  i could only hope to have nurses working with me as impressive as you. i wish you only the best. you continue to speak truth and inspire.
hey pretty lady i m so glad you have a head on your shoulders. you re the real woman.
my daughter has decided she is at her best self when she s called mom... in 5 months i ll be blessed with grandchild number 5... she said if god wants her to have more then she will love them all..
to all the amazing women in the world  y all truly are amazing  i love you all agape
ha ha! right
@kerryrodwell9629
don t ever let these people make you doubt your sanity!
amen brother!! amen!
...definition of a woman......the only thing that can give birth to a soul......what a wonderful gift from god...
your one of my favorite women on youtube i have in my life.  thanks for your bravery and faith in jesus christ to guide you too speak the truth too everyone that listens too your channel!!  may god bless you
i totally agree. i don t need approval from  anyone  who cannot see me for the whole being that i am. all i ask is for respect and as a lady  i love when a man treats me with respect by opening a door  and other simple acts of kindness.nov 19 is international men s day
amen!! i homeschooled our 2 sons k-12 and loved it!! now my son and beautiful daughter-in-law are expecting our first grandbaby and i m so looking forward to helping them nurture their baby!!
always enjoy listening to your messages of wisdom   encouragement! mad love   support!!!
yet another masterpiece from patriotnurse.
amen. what a mighty god we serve.
i ll be back later....but patriot nurse rules!!
amen sister...we have to stop all this nonsense.. i am women and that s all i ve ever wanted to be.. we need our men..
amen  that was fulfilling
i believe you hit nail on the head when you said you are thankful for the way god created you. men and women are not supposed to be in competition with each other over who is better  exempting those events of literal  competition   i.e.  a contest . we are meant to compliment each other  as in uplift and support and assist. as a man  i value women because god created them  and he created them different from me.
happy to see you today you were always a breath of fresh air
hi pn. so captivating. politics and changing cultures ruins the lives of untold numbers. staying with the word of what god has to say about how to live is the only way to be fulfilled. thank you pn and be safe in your travels. sent with love.
your knowledge and reasoning never fails to impress me.
thank you so much for sharing this. it is so refreshing and in contrast to agendas being pushed today. god s way is the best way  every time!
my wife is a flight instructor for 20 years.  was invited to speak at woman s pilot association. her topic was to be how male pilots kept her down in her career. as soon as she said she never had that experience and male pilots have been so helpful.  she was no longer welcome and was shown the exit.
i so enjoy your sane videos! it s so refreshing to hear information relayed the way you do! i really appreciate you and your work! keep it up!
girl  you on fire with this one!
as for me and my household  we will serve the lord.
god bless you for your truth and faith.
make that gestate a soul. the soul is there from the beginning. even dogs and cats know that.
i agree 100   we do need our men!
i love it!  my best friend is a pilot   and my hubby  too  btw .  she is quite happy with how very well she s been treated  and has the paycheck to show it.
very well said.i love how you pointed out that nurturing is more than just children. i unfortunately do not have my own children  but i strive to nurture friends  family  and those around me.i can relate to the rebelliousness as well  lol.
patriotic women like you are real women!
as a woman who has been modestly clothed and covered for a long time  and also now as an elder  kind  thoughtful men frequently step up and help me when i need it.  i always smile to them in return and say  thank you  i appreciate it!!  it s all very simple   people like being appreciated and well thought of for  being kind.  it is a mutual exchange that is satisfying to both  so why carry resentment and a grudge around with you  it short circuits the whole process
this is amazing!!!!!  as a stay at home  who was always asked   don t you want more   or   you don t add to society     oh brother  wasn t the point  that i could chose
thank you! this has been needing to be addressed  publicly  for some time now!  mainstream took the admirable task of women s recognition appreciation and twisted it into a vile  hate-filled agenda.  they have reduced men and women from their individual splendor  and attempted to blend them into a nondescript  weak humanoid without values  morals  or a soul.  i wish this video could go  mainstream  to straighten out and educate the masses!
you are amazing as usual  always such an insparation to me  hello from nicole in wyoming  thank you for holding the line with me all these years now  and i would so play this at a coctail party  always been a rebel too
never heard of woman s day  there was a secretary s day back in the day. i have been out of the work force to long. i loved having the door opened for me today and sincerely thanked the gentleman. i love when my husband pulls out my chair in a restaurant. i love the line of strong women in my family. having children making a home. thanks you for those memories.
i know this is totally off topic  but  i m gonna say it anyway. please  please don t ever lose that wit. your sarcastic  for the lack of a better word  wit is so awesome. i love the way you combine  sarcasm   wittyness  and silliness so perfectly..especially when you follow it with a good laugh. like when your talking about you being a rebel and at the end when you said not to play this at a cocktail party..i have alot going on right now  please keep me in prayer  and i just wanted to thank you for putting a smile on my face..especially at 4 am..
thank you thank you patriots newest that was the best feature i ve heard anybody say in a long time god bless
sister. there are very few out there like you. you re a very special ad unique female in these times.  god bless you
i feel like it kind of really geared up in the 90s and recently hit its peak.  i think it s getting back to more of a  being feminine and traditional is fine  as long as that is your choice and you aren t forced into it.  i ve seen that a lot in comments on tiktok etc lately. i agree that there s nothing wrong with traditional femininity or a traditional household  etc. it just should be someone s choice. cool with me. it s honestly all a pendulum. also there is an international men s day in november. the 19th. last...i didn t realize that women couldn t even get their own credit card without a man until 1974. kind of crazy. guess that s why i m all for the 2nd amendment.
thank you for these words. i pray for boldness to express myself as you often do! glory to god!
our g-d is an awesome g-d!! your message of the nature of women being the nurturer is so spot on what has been on my heart of late. we are the home builders.   not house  those tend to be the men  but we make it a home  a sanctuary for our families . we nurture our sons and daughters  while our g-d fearing men  fathers  raise them to be g-d fearing adults. we are supposed to work side by side. but with our husbands and fathers with the last word.b  h ...   may he who keepeth israel  keep his hand upon you  pn and give you strength and peace.
my mother had to march for women s day behind the iron curtain. enough said...
this was awesome! thank you for sharing this. there was a city counsel meeting in portland oregon yesterday that a woman who is a patriot and fighting the woke narrative waited to speak about the devestation residents and businesses are experiencing because of the insane policies and laws in our state and in multnomah county where portland resides. instead of the critical issues facing the city  council members chose to celebrate and talk all the brave women who have had abortions and how more needs to be done and all the other disgusting narratives promoted in the city.  angela todd  of pdx real waiting and only had a small space to speak and little will be done. it was a sickening moment. this state holds the dubious title of easiest place in the country to get an abortion  including late term abortions. killing a baby is a right of passage here almost. and the counsel sat ignoring what was truly important to state that more needs to be done for abortion access as women s healthcare. so yesterday was hard here. what it means to be a god fearing woman has no meaning for women who do not understand what it means to be a godly woman in the first place. so thank you for saying what you did. i will be sharing this with those here who also need the encouragement to marshall on in their faith as women who get it.    btw...i had to move out of portland and am in a very safe small town not far from there. i still support the work being done to wake up the citizens angela and others who are taking on a very difficult task. fentanyl is as easy to get as water  and businesses are closing  and people moving out  people who have the money to be able to afford to more. it s a veritable war zone in many areas of the city. portland residents are learning it is a self rescue situation. forgive the long winded comment...it s all connected really. sin begets more sin and on and on it goes.
thanks pn for putting into words that which many of us are thinking- god bless you!
pure respect for you  for saying what needs to be said!
the patriot has  very good insight on many matters and stands true against the satanic lies. be safe and stay strong in god.
all i wanted for years was to find a woman merry her have children  god willing  and even the  christian  women didn t nothing but lead me on and lied to me  and my family friends  it has gotten so bad i m egnoring females. you are one of the very few i give any of my time to. thank you for all you do. i m certain this is at a great personal cost to you and yet you still choose to help. thank you again.
don t give up hope the right one may come along... my husband had 2 failed marriages was single and alone for 14 yrs  and then i came along  poor mans been stuck w  me for 33yrs now lol.
@hycoperosity5843  thank you. i ve been lied to to so often by   christian women.  stood up at the alter two different times by two different females  will not call them women   i have been celibate for over two decades because  someday i might meet my wife and intend to not have bad news. i have not given up hope i have however quit praying to a god that refuses to listen or does listen and egnors said prayer
@stevecook413  i promise you there are good women out there .
@stevecook413
the power confidence intelligence and morality the radiates from you is quite amazing the most high is strong in you
fantastic to hear the things you had to say on this topic  especially when you keep it biblical. awesome job @patriotnurse!
i m just going to say  you re a beautiful and powerful example of  a confident  bold and christ centered woman! i believe time is short  last days   seeing all the wokeness and perversion  romans 1 and 2 peter 3.clearly you have an opportunity to  expose the spirit behind feminism and awaken  bring into the light  so many! keep fighting the good fight  you re a voice of truth in a lost and dying world!love in christ
another great message! love you! love being a woman!
a  video!refreshing to hear an honest opinion of the subject.
you look happy.  i hope whatever is bringing you that continues!    i am having a really hard time understanding why people feel the need to be something they are not.   god doesn t make mistakes  take what you have been given and run with it.
... flow in our feminine power ...yes!   i am so glad to hear this  thank you!
god i love this womanbless you for bringing this topic to light!!
your clear thinking is not just refreshing and so appreciated but the absolute truth... thank you for verbalizing my unconscious thoughts... everything can get so twisted before you realize it s satan at work ...pretending to be an angel of light ....but causing chaos and violence...you go sister tell the truth and shame the devil!!!
you nailed it sis .god bless you and stay safe and strong.
it is so good  to see you  up and running on all 8 cylinders again. i now have 3 feisty lady friends living in tennessee. patriot nurse  patara  and melissa who left  kalifornia with her husband joel. y all are a real kick in the pants. the world had better look out......
i m glad my mom was a woman
you are so awesome pn.  i just enjoy listening to you so much.  god bless you.
it s hard to find women like yourself. stay true!
feminism and leftwing lunacy was the main wedge that split my parents apart  so this video hits home for me and is quite brilliant on your part to explain it the way you did. you absolutely hit the nail on the head. all misguided liberal women should see this video. you are awesome and keep doing what you re doing. you never cease to amaze me and i think you are highly intelligent  strong and beautiful inside and out. i m a rebel too always have been. god bless!!
love it! agree with you 100  pn. god bless you   thank you.
sharing!!
thank you for giving voice to everything i feel.
well said!! truth is so wonderful to hear.
thank you for explaining this  i did not hear of international womens day until the iron curtain went away and russians eastern bloc got to communicate freely with the west.  i thought it was a communist s holiday.  yuck!  personally i treated it as respecting   appreciating  individual women.
be funny if she wasn t..
@thewarriorcall  funny to you maybe
@richardstever3242  funny to anyone
you preach it  sister.
you are such a great example of a woman!   thank you for sharing.   can t wait to see you in utah.  you crack me up...
i love you patriot nurse! thank you!
thank you for your truth based  words and your continual testimony. the true reverence for womanhood should always be held high and supported by men  especially husband s. the dark side has twisted realities so that those of the faithful need our support more than ever of the true meanings of the feminine. strong  fierce  dedicated  humane  leaders  compassionate  mother s  wives  daughters have had the privilege to work with in my 32 years in the fire service.
i certainly agree about opening the door for her  especially going into a building   whether it s your mom  spouse  sister or female co-worker.  i have found that when i hold a door open for any woman  that it s almost always reciprocated back to me at some point during my work week.     so i appreciate the good women in my life  but just my older sister but also my twin sister and mother  as well as the ones on my work team .   a true woman is grateful for the simple gestures to honor her.   feminists in the world don t understand that.    god made each one of us for a divine purpose  his purpose .
your awesome.  i wish i could find someone like you.  keep up the good work  and my prayers are with you.
a perfect way to end the day... listening to this delightful lady.
another home run!   always a pleasure to watch your videos!
well said pn.  praise god for he made the woman  exceptional!   why would anyone want to change that   you are godly beautiful from the inside out.  thank you for your services over the years.
thank you patriot nurse for your infuation of god !!! love all your messages videos
always worth it to watch until the end.
thank god there are any real women left in this madhouse. and thank you for bien one!

@gloriald444  i feel for you..we fled carrollton and moved north of dfw. our neighborhood went south quick!
@jsbphotorebel  i hear you this is not my carrollton i grew up in. for the moment we still live in a  good  neighborhood. we are hoping to escape dfw area within the next year  maybe sooner.
thank you so much for your message today. i appreciate you and wholeheartedly agree. women do not have to try to be in the place of men. a woman has her own place  carefully and lovingly made by our creator.
i love your channel!  i agree with you ! this stupid womens  day thing is ridiculous!  by the way  when is international mens  day   can t wait to celebrate that!
thank you for doing this video patriot nurse.
another outstanding message!
loved your take on  women s day.  you echoed my thoughts exactly. it s such a farce. the current culture is so anti-woman.
this was one of your best!
love your content it s spot on
just awesome! thank you!
believe it or not dear there are some areas where women are not taught to read here in the u.s. though it is very rare and frowned upon nowadays.  i have even been in some foster homes where women could not touch the bible and only a man could read it to her.  that said  i think they were very fringe.  also  i noticed the gentlemen in this particular foster home treated women with a lot of respect and protected them.  so there were pluses and minuses.edit   my nurturing side is like a stern puritan about certain things.  my kids hate it.  i am more of a protector of the weak and innocents than a help them grow type.  i don t know why.  perhaps because i was not protected.
i always share your videos. they can throw me out of parties every time. let s me know who my friends are.
amem girl!!!! wow!!!! powerful and well said!!!
thank you for clarifying the need to not be more like men  its crazy out here its better if everyone can work together and be appreciative of our differences versus the us against them mentality  nice channel  keep them coming.
god bless patriot nurse. you are spot on and you surely are looking good and healthy. praise god. keep fighting the good fight sister! much love.
such a nice show  i was very happily married for almost 39 yrs  she was 14 yrs older than me  i treated her like a queen  she s been gone for 3 years now  sad to say but what i think of as a real woman is a thing of the past  i totally agree with you on all points  please keep up the good work !!
yes yes yes  jael was the first person i thought of!!!  she s always been one of my favorite heroines.
so much intelligence out of such a beautiful women.
as always  outstanding word  little sister!
this is a deep subject.  yes patriot nurse explains well with common sense. most don t see what s happening. thanks   my patriot nurse   for sharing truth. nice to see ya!  jim
now that  was empowering! shalom sister!
get out of my head  lady. you are speaking my mind.

you go chick   they are trying their hardest to put everyone in every  pronoun   against each other. we can t let it happen  the race issue has tried to flare up but all we can do is pray. you sure can tell your a rebel though  i remember thinking that about you back when you made your call to action  type video just after cv. you were ready to jump in the trenches faster than the majority of guys . you got the fire though  and you can tell you love the lord. no b.s.  just wish there were more like you out there so it wouldn t be so hard to find a decent person. god bless you!!

mens day is buy your husband a new gun month and its this month ladies. my  sister and i were raised by my single mother who worked full time eventually retiring from 2 separate companies. dad still done the dad thing  there every 2 weeks like clock work. 7 years later he regrew a brain and a heart and came back home  dang guitar picker ..lol. she never loved anyone other than him. she was the child of sharecroppers her and her sisters and brothers picked cotton by hand till they were all all in the later teens there were 9 kids. all 6 strong women 3 boys military. what you folks call prepping we just called life when i was growing up.. i still can food because she taught me i still hunt from what dad taught me.  i m for giving my woman everyday not just one day till she drops me in the dirt.
amen!!
thank you patriot nurse! the way the bible chronicles the importance of women is amazing.  from the women you mentioned to the way jesus treated them with respect and dignity.  those who would dismiss the bible as demeaning women  should try reading it.
lots of really great points!
you are so right patriot nurse  great video. feminism is a cancer and ruined family and the family nucleus. i love your videos  god bless.
excellent as usual!!!
i m camping with ya  pn! rebels for rightiousness  god bless you and yours.

hi patriot nurse. i have been a subscriber for quite awhile.  i started prayer circles for you when you were ill. you look healthy and happy now  thank god.  i wish i had the funds to join your teaching seminars. i am pretty smart but my financial position tanked because i would not comply and i lost my job. god bless you and may he keep you safe from all evil.
great chat patriot nurse   i just love your truthspeak girl.....00tg from illinois......
wisdom as always and appreciated.  i let the day go by without notice even though my dna  god and everyone else that i know  identifies me as a woman.
camping out in the scripture is a great way. thanks for sharing from the heart
thankyou!  love being the mom that god created me to be
my great grandmother-she was a woman! she became a widow  and made the decision to load up the wagon with all the kids  travel hundreds of miles by wagon  to a place she had never been  to start over. there were 7 families in the area. a trip to town took 2 weeks for supplies. there was only 1 church nearby  and once a month  she would pack up the wagon  and take the 2 day journey  usually alone to go hear the preacher. she camped in the woods  on friday and saturday night. get up and finish the trip to church on sunday morning  and then turn around  and start the journey back. she was faithful and true! she was a woman that helped start this very town that i live in  today.
even my two teenage sons cannot believe the garbage that they are seeing now. my entire family has now boycotted hershey s products because of the stupidity  and the fact that i feel like they are actually disrespecting women and considering how much i love the women that have had a role in my life and my upbringing i won t patronize any corporation or entity that promotes this stupidity.
oh my god she made a star trek reference   i love you patriot nurse
you re amazing!!!
i work for lowe s and got a email telling us about women empowerment month.  i was so disgusted by this.

shabbat shalom blessings
preach it sister!
lol  you are so awesome!
hubby better be cool when you you guys go camping   lol . thanks for sharing that part and others from scriptures .
too bad more great ladies are not talking about this truth.
thank the lord god for such a beautiful and smart woman that speaks the absolute truth. have a beautiful and blessed weekend. galatians chapter 2 verse 20p ress a headsayingt hanks for what we have learned  that equips us to move ahead.
you are awesome. i agree with everything you said here. feminism destroyed men too. instead of men being the head of the household as god wants  they were to show their feminine side. look what has happened. to me it s really sad what the woke have been doing  to our children. it definitely is not god  will.
there is an international men s day. this year it will be november 19. i doubt if there will be any publicity about ti though.
what can one say      you are simply amazing and always impress with that razor sharp intellect. and beautiful to boot.
i love me some patriot nurse!
the story you told us found in the book of judith. calvin didn t think she was an appropriate role model for girls  so he had it removed from the protestant by bible. judith was a widow. she dieted until she was thin again as part of her mourning process. her town was under seige. she got permission to go out to draw water. she knew the enemy commander would  send  for her. when he did  she drove a tent stake through his head and saved a nation just as you described. it s the end of women when they make it a holiday. the same fiends who can t define woman. they ll delete mothers day next.
moved my soul ..
well said   i  can t say i agree with all videos but i can respect them. tak care b safe
thanks for your voice patriot nurse i wish more women were like you. my dear jewish christian wife is alot like you thank god for the good women of the world.
shoot i d play this at any cocktail party....that is  if i ever cared to go to one lol. shabbat shalom sis.
you have given an excellent answer to the  what is a woman  question and fully grounded in scripture.  all of the woke ideologs  could learn a valuable lesson it they would only listen.  i m just waiting for the woke to define  what is a man .
right-on patriot nurse.
they ve been trying to cancel women since giving bruce jenner woman of the year.  i don t get it... great video patriot nurse!  keep doing the things!
lookin smokin  hot today patriot nurse! our country needs more strong and versatile women these days. keep up the great work.
mazel tov rachel!!!
i am not a religious person  but a line in prayer has always stuck with me.  thy shall be on earth as it is in heaven .  what would you want heaven to be like  now just go from there and don t pay attention to what others think.      spheremotor
beautiful patriot   god bless u. best nurse!!      ml o7
enjoyed the sassyfrass as always
...amen  my sister!!!
truthas always!
the power of all men and women is their ability to cooperate with other men and women.
well said sister!!!!
i ve watched you since the day s of main prepper  you are definitely a lady. you have a beautiful soul. no disrespect but i think you are also as pretty with or with out make-up. god bless you  and your work.
amen sister
still  i m absolutely perplexed.  how can you not be married   it seems such a waste in some way. i suppose  speak for myself   i d be nearly useless as your husband.  i d be so enamored   so awestruck  so taken  i d likely never get anything of importance done. for the rest of my life.  god certainly created a masterpiece in you. we  the public   have been fortunate to be able to watch you grow into the woman you are today. stunning.
patnurse  i can tell several things about you through the years. 1  i can tell you could shoot the eyeball out of a squirell at the top of a 100 ft tree from 100 yards away and 2  you would never wind up in a battered woman s shelter. and that s why if given the chance to meet you  i would sit and listen to anything you had to say
thanks so much very helpful.
yeah i was listening to someone who said women couldn t have a bank account in 1962. i was like  where is this nut from   my mom was a widow in 1962 and she worked and had a bank account. as a matter of fact i was in 2nd grade in 1963 and i had a savings account at school the credit union had a passbook account for kids and we could save over ten cents a week.
god bless you.  love the video
the who has superceded treaties with countries including what our senate has the right to decide for americans by declaring a  pandemic . then deciding for your hospitals and doctors what treatment is. i fear there is a day that i will not go to a hospital because of all this. offering training may be the only opportunity we get for ourselves  our families  and friends. god bless everyone.
am n!!
yep! tent spike chick was my favorite story they never taught in sunday school!
pn   in celebration of women s day  may this grandpa say that you are pretty  ma am.  throw in an m-4 and a sig p-226 and all i have to say is   wow  what a woman! sister  where and how can i get a vile of injectable lidocaine for my bug out bag   my dermatologist says she has a hard time acquiring some for her practice.  all i ve found is 2  lidocaine cream.  in case the shtf  what do i use to effectively numb skin in order to suture a wound   thank you for your lucid outlook on life.
love it!!! i did not participate or get involved. but then again  anything promoted by the msm and liberals is the exact opposite of what i want. i don t need a day to be a woman  especially from people who can t define what  woman  means. boom.
thank you so much for all you do. and with hair that pretty resistance is futile.. ha ha ... ty again
for me march is irish history month ! ! !
good video  thank you
hershey s certainly proved this today! no more hershey candy for me. no big loss.. at all.
you are like my wife  awesome  keep it up!
you had me at hey folks.  brilliant and beautiful.  you should move to maine. i m not gonna wait for you forever.
we need a grassroots common sense reawakening to combat wokeness.
excellent!!!
i just want to say miss my mother s cooking.  she made tortilla s from scratch everyday and never waivered with rice and bean s. to say i don t love women is to say i don t need oxygen.
awesome!
your funny  luv our sisters in the bible that helped shape us as women my favorites were ruth and ester
a intelligent  informed  beautiful christian woman....i am in love.
thank you!
very well spoken  and i m very happy to see that there are still women out there that understand that men and women weren t supposed to be in peeing contests with each other. it shouldn t be about  greater than or less than  men need women  and women need men.  together  we form a complete package as god designed that covers all the bases in his plan.  that s not saying that people can t be single and function just fine  nor is it saying that they are not part of god s plan. but men and women together form a very special package  they have each other s backs and help each other to be able to do great things. my life has been filled with far too many  feminists   and i always found it interesting that they have to keep talking about it and advertising it  as if they re trying to convince themselves of something  like they re chasing a ghost.  i was married to one.  that will never happen again.  i want a strong  god-fearing woman who is confident enough in who she is to not feel the need to switch gender roles or feel that everything has to be a competition.
i wish more women understood this. women have a lot more power than most realize. i ve made a fool out of myself more than once to get their attention.
she can stop by massachusetts on the way....i may convince her to stay here instead.
not to mention putting a fully intact man in a dress on the cover of a  woman if the year  magazine  or the  her she  chocolate bar or celebrating a fully intact man beating a woman in woman s sports...saying essentially that the best woman is a man. you re right  there is no celebration for real women anymore.
i love your content. thank you for everything. i just cant buy all the jesus bits. never have  never will.
well said! i hate all this cringey  women s day  garbage.pn looks happy! that makes me  happy.

i am a proverbs 31 woman... my man can go and sit at the gate  and do what he needs to do  i will run the household  run the business  run the farm  have the babies  take care of the house  take care of the fort. everything will be here  and in order  when you get home. i am the first officer  i can run the ship  but i am not the captain  i was designed to be the  help-meet. here s the thing  if the captain goes down  i can run the ship. the definition of a submissive wife  ducking just low enough for god to hit him instead of me. and then i will run the ship until he recovers. enough said...
i d like to hear what you think of the global development of 15 minute cities. who s behind these prison camps and the legal aspects
thank you  patriat nurse.
my mother was a housewife.  she was married for 65 years to my father  until he passed . my mother was wonderful  she was an amazing cook and seamstress.  she always had a smile on her face.  she always dressed properly anytime she left the home even to go to walmart.  this is what feminism destroyed.  now you reap what you have sown.  men are woman and woman are men.
well said...
the hair
8 35... ha ha... i m that way too. my favorite bumper sticker of all time is...  question authority.  of course  that s human authority... never god s authority. i totally yield myself to god and his authority over me. i m glad that as a devout christian i can still be a rebel about the ways of the world. i refuse to conform to it.
yes! thank you
jael the nail...the best!

cathay williams was an american soldier. a black woman  she enlisted in the united states army under the pseudonym william cathay. williams became the first female african american to enlist and the only documented woman to serve in the u.s. army while posing as a man during the indian wars. wikipediashe enlisted 99 years before i join the airforce  in 1866. she wanted to support herself without relying on her friends and neighbors and relatives.i don t know where is it paul harvey  now you have the rest of the story
no  we cannot have an international men s day!  we have so few men left.
the whole  woman s day  thing ticks me off  especially since the decided to do it on my birthday. harumph! not all that into celebrating my birthday  but come on! totally agree that feminism is not supportive of women.
on facebook i told people that if they re one of those who don t stand for the pledge and support those people then get out  go to china then. my wife just told me my cousin and his fiance uninvited me to their wedding  then may their day and marriage be cursed with misery and tears!
so beautiful im in love
that is so me a revel and  camp out with the scriptures
amen
love jael   mountain goat   and deborah   bee

hello!! is sparta  tn a good area to homestead and raise kids
well if you work part time look after the home .that s great ..look after your husband...even if your a better shot than he is ....family is about surviving together not being in a cult..
you are right. all this crap has dishonored women.
i respectfully disagree  pn.  you would absolutely -rock - a dinner party.  and i think any of your viewers here would agree.  glad purim and the success of the woman known as esther.
feminism...is dead...the men won....trans in women s sports...... love your message.....
ladies know you re worth! god never intended for you to be less than just different from men hint   little words mean a lot proverbs 31 10 who can find a virtuous woman  for her price is far above rubies.
i don t want a day or a month based on my chromosomes i didn t choose.  i like mother s day because i worked hard at being a mom.  i like nurses  day because i worked hard at being a nurse.  i don t need woman s day month.
amen !!
the borg collective mindset was referred to as the hive mindset. fyi your such a girl...praise god!...thumbs up!

@patriotnurse3
too bad our clueless flotus doesn t understand these concepts.  i m just waiting to see god s hand at work  fter hearing that flotus proudly and publicly celebrated a biological male with an international women s day award.
if you want feminine women we need to masculate the men again. most men are not being raised to value a stay at home wife who raises their kids. instead they are taught to value a working mom who puts the kids with another person to influence. the government teachers daycares are not an appropriate substitute for a mother. when that job of being a mother and raising her own kids was removed from her  it had to be filled in another way to add value  work . men need to be men and support their own families because the government systems are brainwashing the youth.
you re the best.
and such a beautiful woman. can i get an amen
thank you.
feminism has reduced both men and women s roles. it has boasted saying women should be equal  and in return shrunk men s value to a household. being a homemaker is basically frowned upon now  but in doing so it has almost required those that are to do things they wouldn t normally need to do. i think all jobs should pay based on skill and character not race or sex. i actually prefer my wife to be at home doing her part  and she does also.. it has become harder on old fashioned family because by requiring business to have certain percentages of women and other races it has reduced the man s salary from how it used to be. many companies have to hire to keep equality and the work load suffers as a consequence. i m not saying women can t do a job or certain races can t do a job  i m saying hiring them to maintain percentages and equality and not for skill has cheapened the effectiveness of labor across the board. and as a consequence made men of less value causing the wife to also be required to work just to pay the bills. it s a crazy world we live in
thoroughly enjoyed your production good part of the difference in man and woman i do a lot of caring for life plant and animal it shows in it s on way i d like to do you a little shooting with you that is something i thoroughly enjoy been known to spend twenty-five hundred rounds in a weekend and like with most things and like most things anyting well-done is a joy there s a lot of art to caring for life and most everything we do in life one of the first papers i wrote what michelangelo and leonardo davinci impressed a teacher it did both prefer to look at the marble in the dawn light and have you ever considered there s something alive in the chill of dawn you are much beloved out here dear lady thanks again may the good lord take a liking to you
amen!
i won t refer to specifics here in your comments  but relating to this narrative  as an rn  i am highly appalled by the stance of the american pediatric association in regard to the medical surgical care being pushed onto vulnerable children. it s become evident that politics is guiding science  with science no where to be found. i am so upset at what we ve witnessed the past couple of years
my kinda women right there  thank you god for helping me find one of my own
being conservative isn t a political view but a mind set or world view. we see natural and godly truth and beauty and know it will not be destroyed as we with god are it s protectors.
the story of humankind   i am god!  always the opposite of  thy will be done on earth even as it is in heaven.
thank you god for patriot nurse just the way she is. looking for a equally yoked woman. are you single     thank you for this video.
i m going to camp out in the same camp you are in sister. the word of god. oh i love jael too.
i don t know why its hard for people to respect women as women  i would hold a door a pull a chair up for an elder  for a man with his hands full  why should it be hard to do this for women
as prob the lone male  gay  voice on here  this is why i tuned out of the parades n  such about quarter century ago. i used to live in germany   the early  love  rave parades were a really cool thing. but when i saw some form of filth co-opt the parade movement in nyc  many years later  i thought    manv other people think this  too    who wants to see floates like this    it was so embarrassing seeing a disenfranchised people lowering themselves down to the basest form of american consumerism   crass gratuitouness  the opposite of  pride . . .
amen!!!
here s a great way to really torque feminists  especially in a city. take a look around you. all of the houses and buildings you see men built. the water gets to your house via an infrastructure men built. who will fix plumbing  electrical problems and your car   you don t need a man until you realize you need one.
union privates were paid  13 per month until after the final raise on june 20  1864  when they got  16.
the women s movement was a good thing at the start just as getting rid of slavery and the civil rights movement was at the beginning.  and i could tell you horror stories that happened to minorities and women i knew in my lifetime  my being older than you are.  however  somewhere along the line  it s become divisive   hatred   resentment of whites and hatred   resentment of men and the craziness  what was that pink hat thing about  .  treating others unjustly because you were treated unjustly in the past is wrong.  period.  we are all individuals  and race  gender  age  interests  size  abilities  and so forth are just a part of who and what we are.  there are many parts to the body of god  not just two parts.  i don t think women want to be men any more than blacks want to be whites.  we all just want freedom and the right to be who god meant us to be  and it varies individual to individual.  having special months and days for things people have not achieved and cannot change about themselves is just divisive  which is what the left wants.
christians should have some understanding of the bible and therefore read revelation as it s being fulfilled right now. the book of daniel and his vision of the seventy weeks of seven  tribulation is the seventieth week of seven years  mathew where jesus speaks of all the signs are here. as in the days of noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man. set your sights on jesus  repent and get right with the lord for rapture of the church and tribulation are imminent.
this is a load of crap. as 50  of humanity i don t need a special day. i ve got a birthday and mother s day for people i love to acknowledge my individual endearment. my husband shows me every day without material commercialism how much he appreciates me.
interesting that you are rejecting the view that women still have a ways to go for equity w  men in many roles in society. what matters is women have a choice -- to stay home or to own their own business or make their own medical decisions. when i started nursing  in the early 70 s  a woman had to have a husband co-sign her surgery consent. if he didn t want a cancerous tumor removed  it stayed in. did it happen often  no  but it did happen. you seem to approach this so  anti-woke   whatever woke means  that you don t appreciate women who have stood up to the status quo to be who they feel they truly are and to have the legal right to be their own person. i don t need a husband to co-sign my car loan  like the nurses coming back from the vietnam war did . and i don t see why celebrating the opportunities for women that are increasing around the world should cause you to leap to the conclusions you have.   another patriotic nurse.
for all you ladies out there that think empowerment comes from how high you can climb the ladder of success   i pose a simple question.  where were your children when you were out proving how you can do anything a man can do   ohhh that s right  your kids were dropped off at public school to be taught how to put a condom on a bannana and told they can be whatever gender they want to be . the elohim may have givin authority of the household to the man   but he gave you ladies the most important job on this earth ........... raising your kids   that s what real empowerment is . the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world  please stop handing your kids over to the enemy !
so the back bone of the family  the home and the only person who bring forth life. is not important but just going to the work force is the most important
love you sister
agree!
how on earth is  women s day  even possible if they can t tell you what a woman even is   and ditto what rebecca lynn tenbrink said!!!
great!
seriously ya scared the crap outta me with the spike in the head story.     i am afraid to take my melatonin

i just put this up on twitter. meeting adjourned.
ok nurse  lol  you are wide open girl. no complaints here  i do believe we are very simular  even though i am a man nurse. i like the way you think. gave up got out  after the awaking or should i say proving to myself 50 times over it was time. have some really special stories. don t stop calling it out. wish we could meet.
i ve also noticed that all the new movies have women as lead roles and all these women beat up all the men  everyone. one woman against a dozen or more unusually strong men and she is a small or average framed woman  yet she kicks all their butts without breaking a sweat. it is absolutely ridiculous. i can t even watch all these stupid movies. i can t help but talk the whole movie and say   she d be dead    she would not have won that fight    there is no way in the world . or the movie display men as weak and sissy-like and the women have to save the day. satan wants to destroy the family and the roles that god has made for us.
those delta yankee kilo echo s are what messed the whole thing up  when it comes to women serving on the front lines....think about this for a minute....   what s the lesser of the two evils... a fatherless child or a motherless child  unless your mother s a full fledged delta yankee kilo echo
good for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thank you
when i grew up most women stayed at home and took care of children and cooking.  i don t say women can t work  but work is not who they are.  the welfare system has helped to destroy the american family in the last 60 years and then they wonder why there is crime.  momma s working all day and no daddy in sight and the government paying for childcare and medical.   it hurts my soul to see the destruction of the family.
hell! they might even give women the right to vote someday! what s this world coming to
it s sad we are treated like sex figures
there actually is a men s day too.
have you watched star trek picard yet   season 2 totally changed the borg.
i remember when women were. my mother  mother in law  wife and daughters were and are. today  god help them because he is their only hope for the future.
03 09 2023 hello teacher  nurst and best friend to those who know the truth and love you and your videos. how is that for a great ladys intro  lets see pearls and curls and french nails. the left must surely be jealous of you and hate you both. you look better and you are smarter than they are for the most part. the evil women that hate god and everything will be looking up and asking jesus to return and not leave them behind for just reason. the temps. sang lying faces sometimes won t tell the truth. on to the good stuff. thank you for being my friend and teacher. you have had a good run at telling the truth and staying on utub. thank you. don
will this live chat be posted later
makes sense.
i m not confused about who a woman is. i am mentally well.

yep  it s crazy....i am a woman of god.
the only girl that blows me a kiss goodbye. that right there is worth watching

november 19th is international men s day. absolutely zero publicity
sorry about being so talkative.over the years to pay did not increase much because when i join the airforce in 1965 my base pay was  78 airman basic  e-1
how can they even have a women s day when they can t even tell you what a woman is
you seemed like you were enjoying that stake through the head thing maybe just a little too much.
i tried coming back subscribed.two vids and god is still doublespeak
happy women s day to all my xx chromosome sisters!
helllo beautifully lady
proverbs  31 10 who can find a virtuous woman  for her price is far above rubies. patriot nurse is one.
i wonder if destroying one s offspring is a response to years of sexual and physical abuse.  how do women stand up to that violence as a young girl being visited at night by dad or big brother
wait until international pansexual day!! lol
she s interesting intelligent  beautiful and an american woman i love this type of feminine women  not the workaholic gotta be smarter than a man type down with feminism

as a masculine presenting transgendered lesbian...i.e. a man...i approve this message...
not to mention a male was given some award for the int l women s day.
good example is a woman getting her way in court with child support  my winking and looking at judge the right way to get what she wants
so god created man in his own image  in the image of god he created him  male and female he created them. gen 1 27enough said. wake up to truth  not woke.
we woman have been disrespected
there is no confusion about what a man and a woman are in the minds of the rational.
i agreewith you
gin-doe-braa  .
i had no idea it was women day.
your awesome
your hair is so pretty like that.
ladies - ask yourselves what man would want this  i hope you won t mind  table for one  for the rest of your  lives.
do you think justice brown knows what a woman is now  now that she sits on the bench
just to add to the list there are so many saints who were women.  st hildegard gave us religious music and was known as a physician  i believe.  st theresa of lesuix was a seeress.  st bridgette gave us the promises of the rosary.  st joan of arc defended france from the british.  two of the three seers of fatima were girls.  sister sasegawa in akita japan was visited by the blessed virgin.  church history is replete with good and holy women  and they didn t need any of today s  rights  or to murder children to do it.
@patriotnurse2 ok. i will contact you through your site patriot nurse.
you know i must have missed that day and biology  when they said that you could be a woman and still have a penis.
your brains and heart are sexy hey your minds out of the gutters y allbut your insight is slot on
as a true women would speak
these people can t even define what a  woman  is...
i like watching your video s but on this one i have to say the 1st minute it sounded like you needed to go to anger management class  but in reality you are great and i did not to mean to be sarcastic with the anger management class remark please accept my apologies  just thought it would have brought a smile to your face.
ja- el my granddaughter  ja-el!
how can there be a woman s day given that nobody knows what a woman is

i am a female truck driver. the only woman on my side of the company. i m physically strong and pretty masculine to an extent. but i live being a woman a carrier of life in my womb a mother n grandmother. feminists are destructive. i can run with the men but i m not a man nor can i be nor can a man be a woman.  this lunacy drives me mad
uh  not really  us normal people know exactly what a woman is. and by the way  your lovely woman. how do i know  because i know what a woman is.
i am not saying we don t fight this at all but we must remember who is behind all this. this being was a liar and murderer from the start and the only way we can fight him is with our faith in jesus. then and only then do we stand a chance against someone who is far cleverer than any one of us.
i don t want their fn liberation either.  and i m a dude.
it just shows   today it takes a man to be a better woman. still winning....  sarcasm ladies

it s insulting to me as a woman. jill biden giving  the woman of the year award to a man who trans to woman insults all real woman. sorry folks.
your so pretty! that is all
women are the givers and the nurturers of life and there is no substitute.
great video. you are so beautiful. my goodness!.
damn!! you are gorgeous
what   you re not hanging out in women s bathrooms handing out tampons   you obviously don t care about women.   snarky dylan mulvaney reference.
fyi....my great grandma was an exporter. women were taking their places along side men until the 1950s.....
fukn a  very intelligent woman by god!
honey  montana is not west coast!  montana is east of washington state and idaho  and is divided between the pacific time zone and the mountain time zone.  definitely not west coast.
make me a sammich !
do you ever come to colorado
i didnt even know about a womans day... i thought that was mothers day.... good grief hopefully nobody got a day off for this nonsense.
never mind the fact that it is a lot easier today now more than ever for a guy to hook up with a girl without any responsibility because that is what feminism tells women that is okay to do. this only benefits men and it s a detriment to women. get laid without any responsibility and when you get tired move on to the next one.
its a bunch of guys in dresses and were supposed to celebrate them while degrading ourselves
the borg  what an awesome analogy! google it kids.
hey rebel ! dont need a womans day if you have a feast called puren . queen esther saved a whole nation   how cool is that ! this woke nonsence is just a poor waste of time by the devil . keep believing beatiful lady ! must be somewhat heartening to see shepard need shepard . god bless

i laugh hysterically when women wine about men invading women s sports. women took everything from men.i agree about women s suffrage. it was a mistake. actually it wasn t a mistake  it was part of the agenda.

i don t even know when it was. i don t want to know. my way to stay sane is to ignore as much of this stupidity as humanly possible.

women run humanity
women s day crapola..
making babies   victory
yep  lgbtxyz  etc. 1  women 0.... no  actually more like lgbtxyz  etc. 10  women 0....  what a victory for ummmm  errrrrr  uhhhhhh....  birthing people.
trannies and un women are honored
you got it all wrong p.n. and that s unfortunate... march 8 is the most cherished celebration of spring  it is the eastern european  eastern in general  mother s day  as you call it in the states   which includes the aspect of liberation through honest work not colonizing and oppressing others in order to become filthy rich and laugh at the world. that s too bad that due to disinformation you and others have mixed it with your american wok-culture vomit. if i were you i would tread more carefully and with less passion on historical things that i m not knowledgeable enough. happy eastern mother s and other young and older women s day! we love and respect you  your work  sacrifice  the effort of raising kids and holding our families together.it would be nice if you would not delete it and let other working women read it even if it s a far cry from your choir.thanks
you lost me at judeo-christian. i can now see why they allow you to stay on this platform run by.....
want to honor god. want to rebel against the world s idea of what a woman should be  or man for that matter. read and put into practice the teachings of titus 2. this isn t rocket science. gods yoke is easy  and his burden is light. men and women swallow your pride. bend your knees. and submit to the will of god. there true joy lies.
