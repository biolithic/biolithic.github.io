disney used to touch our hearts. now they touch us inappropriately.
i truly thought disney couldn t mess up star wars or its public image anymore than they already have. i m here to simply say. i was wrong  and i have never been more disgusted.
i feel genuinely scared for the future of kids with these disgusting and creepy things that are being allowed. i m glad you re covering this insanity  amazing work melonie. keep up the great work and enjoy the rest of your day please.
i had to comment  i found you through tomb raider news and subbed because i agree with how you look at the world. and hearing this video  i m so glad you re passionate about these topics. i m 35 and the world is changing for the worse. it s refreshing to see someone like yourself smash the powers above. drag and gender terms should not be pushed on children  or anyone really. i think the masses should boycot dirty disney and stop being so accepting of all the weird stuff that goes on.
no kids are asking for drag shows  just adults desperate to be trendy.
really enjoyed you and jay on the wttr podcast. after that i watched  fat fiction  and went down a food rabbit hole. plus i m also reading the bible again. thank you.
what does star wars need the most  not a drag show!
this should be illegal and everyone involved should be arrested
they must really hate you right now! it s ok because we love you for speaking out.
what part of star wars screams we need a drag show
star wars has hit rock bottommickey  hold my hormone blockers  haha
definitely never going to disney after this! kids really don t need to be exposed to that! also great video melonie! you look great today!
that sounds disgusting. disney is lost. i can t stand what they re doing.glad to see you melonie. i hope you have a good day
do you ever feel like our world is becoming more and more like sodom and gomorrah  i ve been saying for decade  actually more . stay well melonie. and we re here for you.
everyone abandon disney  protect the children.
the whole children lover thing got amplified like crazy since the child friendly puppet got installed
this is a spot on and brilliant take melonie
let s be honest  the parents that take their kids to this are worse than disney themselves.  and the people who don t have kids and still go are just as bad
i couldn t agree more on this topic. you spoke my mind so clearly.
disney s become the sodom and gomorrah of the entertainment industry...
it s grooming.
bloody hell!

hahaha. that a loose school off rock reference  even if it s not it s what it reminded me of.
they touch our children too
unfortunately...
it s gonna get way worse too
at least we re got ep 4-6  1-3  some good games and eu ... after that for me  only clone wars animation is canon ... which i love to watch between ep2 and 3. other than that there is some  sw story  which is kinda fun to watch  but doesn t follow katarn and jan... but it s decent to watch as a marvel rollercoastermovie.hell  i even like the weird off-set endor adventures as a side story. rebels was kinda pushing it  although i liked a lot of it...mandalorian seemed interesting at first  but doesn t add much..sw games a decade ago orso are more star wars than anything else besides mentioned  especially for me the x-wing tie-fighter games ... they had more intrigue and new ships in a year or so span....than awakens 30 years later with pretty much x-wing 1.01 and tie fighter 1.01 .. even though even in ep 6 there were already new ships. ugh.
what s wrong with drag
@mikaele3137  what s wrong with you
@mikaele3137   who think kids needs to see drag
how naive you were
but let s not forget about the amazing star wars holiday special from 1978. long before disney took over. it put s return of the jedi to shame.
@5british5  wouldn t a cartoonish drag queen  as if there s any other kind  be really insulting to women
@scottdoesntmatter4409  i mean  what is a woman tho  that s a tough question for those whose reality and morels are bendable.
w all this garbage in america last decade or so i am more scared for my 2   10 yr old girls then i ve ever been!!  futureofamerica  isthereafutureforamerica
@joewalterstooljunkie555716  it s so gross  i seriously don t get how a person s brain can think  oh yeah  drag but for little kids  that sounds normal to me!  and these people aren t ignorant about this  they re straight up proud of these ungodly beliefs. i m glad i don t have kids  i d be unable to sleep worried about what people are feeding them in school and daycare.
there are parents in this world that see this and got excited to take their children.  that s the scariest part for me
@joe basement woodworking   diy  this is happening in europe chief.  believe it or not  they are actually even worse than america at this point. that s not saying much because america is awful  but there are places that are even more degenerate
@batman0  it s not that they think it s normal  it s that they want to make it normal and that s why they go after the little kids before they re too old to know better. yes it s totally gross.
don t be afraid. especially if you accepted and believe in christ. the day will come when all of this madness will end.
make sure to have an airsoft replica on hand in case these mutated drag freak invaders self insert emselves at comic con i d recommend mid cappers freeloaded w .30g metal bbs.
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners
they know they can t change the general public and their views culturally and religiously so now they aim for the children and like others have said it s grooming  it s not going to stop until people demand they also respect you rights and stop grooming children.
amazon wants to do a tomb raider tv show but a movie its not going to be better than the last two movies classic  but this is more fuel to the fire. for star wars
i grew up in the 80s. church services  bible studies  youth groups  camps  etc. everywhere i went they were all preaching about how christians were being persecuted. i d look around and be like  maybe in other countries  but here.  not in north america.  not really.it s here now.
@se7entse7en  if you want to see christian persecution  check out nigeria.
i dunno if there s anyone beyond the alphabet community that wants drag shows in the first place. haven t heard of any.
@aedryk  never heard of that before.
oh yay this makes me so happy to read! thank you so much for sharing in a comment  god bless you!
@meloniemacgoboom  thank you and god bless you too.
and then subsequently fed legs first in to a wood chipper
how would this be illegal  nobody is stripping down  they re literally just in several layers of clothes dressed as characters who are of a different gender. nothing about that is even remotely dangerous or illegal.
fo real
i was going to say that s europe for you but it s coming to a city near you soon.
well said
amen to that
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners
a question this universe has no answer for. it s absolutely gross.
@batman0  clearly disney needs to reintroduce employee drug testing
pfff
thank you so much!!!
baymax shopping for tampons didn t stop you
@jonathandevereaux298  exactly. my grandson and i stumbled upon that. didn t make it very far in.
should have donated more money maybe she d date you
awesome video  my dear!
you also can t spell  they re   so ease up on the moral high ground and maybe pay closer attention to when you might be getting scammed by clickbaiters
and a bunch of dummies went to see avatar anyway.  cameron flipped of the fans  called men toxic  and people still willingly gave disney money anyway for the most predictable and horribly written movie of the year
@davemccombs  rude
@davemccombs  why would you correct someone s spelling but not place a period at the end of your own sentence so  i guess we really can t brush aside someone s opinion based solely on a grammar error  right
yeah  i think the end is nye. just keep praying and god will liberate you from all this madness.
yup it absolutely is! and thank you
huh.  what was s g like
honestly  i think we left sodom and gomorrah in the rear view. we live in some evil times.
welcome to hell my friend!
indeed
hopefully it gets burned metaphorically as we stand at a far distance to watch it burn and not to be turned into salt.
pretty much
you cannot get further from appropriate with drag shows
disney used to be one of my favourite outlets for family-friendly entertainment.evidently  not any longer. . . . .
the only star wars kids should only watch are the original trilogy  the prequel trilogy  the clone wars  and rebels  as well as the original extended universe  no more of disney s disgusting woke grooming! keep making awesome videos  melonie!
glad you re calling this out melonie because this is utterly disgusting that disney is doing this they re a lost cause at this point
i always wonder what the shareholders think when crazy stuff like this happens  and this is just sick.  if there s no pushback against this  i don t know what could galvanize people to finally take a stand.
we ve tolerated enough of these disgusting people. this is what eventually  happens  and will probably get much worse until they are stopped.
just saying your very inspirational with your channel and all that. i stream on twitch and youtube but i have always wanted to do it full time. so seeing people like you doing this makes me have hope!
their are insane in letting this happen
bugs bunny taught me that dressing in drag can be funny. i even tried to wear a sexy red dress for halloween once for comedic purposes when i was 20. sadly i misplaced the dress.   i knew i shoulda taken that left turn at albuquerque!
do what must be done. do not hesitate  show no mercy.
it s terrifying that pedos aren t even afraid to out themselves anymore.  keep up the great work calling this evil out.
what that s completely freaking messed up.i m so glad melonie that u brought this out.if you hadn t than i d would of never heard of it.why does everything have tokeep going down the wrong side.
we ve come quite a far ways from  why do you care what people do in the privacy of their bedroom  to  you re a bigot if you don t celebrate this for all to see
i remember this world was made for good
disney can go bankrupt. it is dead to me. walt disney would be like a lion  ripping and tearing people apart in disney. he would fire them and condemn them all to not have a job within disney.
i wonder if disney execs sit around a room and brainstorm   how can we lose more money
i am the father of 7 1 2 year old quadruplets.  i am so upset that i and my wife have to screen absolutely everything our children watch on media now.  we have written off taking our kids to disney world anymore  which has always been a dream of ours and attending public events  parades  festivals  and even days we go to the library  depends on what will be happening at said event  due to things like this garbage taking place.  i m not the only one either.  i know many parents in my area alone  are getting together to create things for our children  such as neighborhood  touch-a-truck  days  or  come fly a kite  days  in order to provide our children with wholesome  family events and content.  i wish corporations like disney would learn not to bend the knee to these sexual predators  but until they demonstrate that they ve learned the error of their ways  then we won t be participating in their hedonism.
drag shows are family friendly and the same folks wanna boycott harry potter. let that sink in.
this just makes me more proud of my little sister  she cannot stand anything disney and would rather draw  read the bible  and learn new skills. drag is sexual preference not meant to be around kids.
this is repugnant. disney should be ashamed....and should suffer even stiffer backlash than they have so far. this is them spitting right in the face of half the country.
so far i m sure they have more shit cooked up that s way worse
in what way is it inappropriate  fully clothed people dressed as starwars characters shouldn t be a problem
up next   strip   prawn shows  for all ages
@scottdoesntmatter4409  when did i say it was a good interpretation of women  they aren t even supposed to be. it s exaggerated heavily for entertainment purposes like a clown
@marcuskahn3783  comic con is a place where you re supposed to wear costumes which is exactly what drag is. seek help.
and maybe some if the older games... katarn and jan are quite memorable.
since when is drag gross  i didn t see anybody complaining about robin williams in mrs doubtfire or adam sandler in jack and jill or even tyler perry in madea. grow up.
since this point  they ve been a lost cause for the better part of a decade now....
@commdante  agreed
@patrickjennings431  that s literally not happening though. i doubt anybody who saw tyler perry as madea or martin as shanene was confused about their gender afterwards. they laughed bc it was funny and entertaining
@commdante  how is it gross tho  drag has been in comedy and theatre since shakespeare plays we re still being written and it hasn t ever hurt anybody.
@scottdoesntmatter4409  i ve seen a few. some are more subtle  but others have exaggerated make up on which is no different than clown make up so it s really not an issue. make up and flamboyant clothes aren t sexual so  again  i don t see how it s gross.
@emilcarter3913  incorrect. have you talked to the 97  of the population that is straight  i doubt you have. i also doubt you reason with anything more than your emotions.
@scottdoesntmatter4409  so you have no counter arguments  got it. if you re gonna be hateful at least have real reasons and evidence to support your claims
black rock is the major lobbyist that s funding disney other than the customers.black rock is responsible for this.
it s time stand up against these pedophiles and put an end to this disgusting trend!
keep at itit s a long road but youtube and twitch are fun and i m about a month or 2 into this and i love itjust keep grinding it
drag ... or crossdressing  huge difference.
@commdante  okay  thanks. i didn t know.
no regret  no remorse.  besides a nice phrase  also a kewl game!
they arent and wont be...they have an agenda and it will be continued to be forced into the movies and theme parks either way....
i remember an episode of modern family where a woman has a ten year old son and she says    i m raising him gay  and she i d already dressing him in flamboyant clothing.  we will see this kind of things more frequently now.
ive been reading through the book of genesis recently  and just finished the story of joseph. i remember as a kid in sunday school being taught that jospeh immediately forgave his brothers  but i m not so sure about that. he spends an awful lot of time jerking his family around in that story  before finally telling them who he is. i think he s a man working through his feelings before ultimately coming to a place of forgiveness. anybody else got any thoughts on this matter
disney has joined the dark side.
that is really messed up  i hate that society has come to this
i am not surprised at all. but nice that you cover it melonie
i sure hope somebody does a hidden camera investigation of this event.
like your videos  honestly  the ones in which you cover scripture. well  disney lost billions last year. i ve been saying it since last summer--there s a new sheriff in town and it s illumination. methinks mario bros. will beat the living tar out of any disney attempt at the box office this year.
and disney wonders why they keep losing money
if people against this are not already boycotting disney  now is the time to start.
i can t help but feel that lot s wife wouldn t want to leave modern america either.
i m starting to fear that there s not enough rope in this world for all these groomers that are coming out of the woodworks as of late...
i already cancelled my disney .  too bad i can t cancel it again.
melonie mac go boom is awesome.  be sure to  like  her to keep seeing her.  what i don t like about the woke-ism is we already live in a nation that allows many hedonistic things  and they have to shout us down for any attention  they have gone wildly bizarre as a mob seeking to be special rebels in their world of ordinary.  disney should be aware that beauty  strength  and youth are prized  but if you choose to focus upon the banal  ordinary  naughty  sex bits  then that is it is for adults  age eighteen and above .  many people will entertain this theme for five to fifteen minutes  and then they are done  because it is boring  i have looked at the girls here on big tech  and then i move on  because i d rather entertain with taylor swift than be bored of someone s project bikini  i ve seen the show  now what  and it isn t going to improve  .  even in the romance novels  they have to create and invent an entire background and theme with good character development  and this is done to entertain moments of the physical relationship.  i remember the bikini beach movies  of the 1960  starring frankie avalon and annette funicello  and they always had to have a theme for the shows  or the audience leaves them  this is from the movie theater era when that was the big thing to do  they would show race-cars  comedians  parachuting  yachts  helicopters  rich   famous...  something  and everybody can dance  and all of that for the love interest of frankie and annette.
this is why we gatekeep our things we enjoy
it is my personal belief that these people didn t have  an awakening  due to video games and such. they always were gay  trans  ect  but they need the  omg! i just discovered i m  enter fetish identity here ! thank you soooo much video games!  then push like everything depends on it  because to them  it does!  to not only keep in the games  but to spread it as far and wide as possible  for the sake of others!  which  of course  means to have it shoved in kids as young as they can get away with faces  and more importantly  minds. because as we all know having seen a 3 year old drop the f-bomb in public  if they see it and hear it often enough.........
disney  what could we do to draw in crowds me  lower prices!disney  no  that won t work. let s have a drag show  yes  that ll work  but it needs a theme. how about star wars
im sorry  but when was ventris gay  is being bald  or evil now synonymous for being gay  also i cant think of a single time where she was even close to being gay  no one flirts more with obiwan than ventris
i still can t believe this is the world we live in. what the hell happened
why does your sexual preference and sexual kink have to be involved in every aspect of your life these days i don t understand. what i do behind closed doors is none of anybody s concern and i would never share it proudly it s private for a reason and should be left that way
you say that as if they haven t already.
joined  lol they ve been the darkside for a while now
there was a dark side  and then there s now a super dark side. there s no balance in the universe anymore  but tipping too much to the dark. now there s a good idea for robot chicken skit.
disney is the dark side....
i think anything hardly decent will do that  people don t have much standards these days.... as long as it has some decent characters and some kind of story ... and isn t woke  it ll probably make millions....
@commdante  yeah  cannot deny that. i think people  families especially  just want to watch movies that are just innocent and fun  especially for children.
@animatedthoughts  made a hardcopy of all the  animated  disney classics  they ve been editing a lot of them already... but yeah  stick to 80s 90s cartoons if you got kids imho.
kinda wonder what kind of people would still be using disney  etc...maybe non-parents that want to keep their kids busy
agreed
it looks like this is a panel so it won t just be out in the open for everyone to see but in a single room. as someone that has worked at conventions  which is for all ages   mature panels like this are restricted based on age and will have convention workers and security checking your id before you can enter and keeping kids out  that includes parents trying to take their kids with them into the panel . even advertising it is restricted. most likely because of the subject  it will be restrictive like this. if it isn t then i would be extremely upset and disgusted just like everyone else here. kids really shouldn t be exposed to this!just cause you cosplay as the opposite sex and as some drag elements to it doesn t make the character drag or a drag icon. it s like fanfiction  just because you write it doesn t mean it s canon so don t go around acting like it is  especially if it s sexualized.
go ahead we will get hours of entertainment with melonie and others tearing it apart an monetizing the shit out of this insanity.
agree with you 100  that kids should never be exposed to this crap  but do we know for sure this will be held i. an open space at the convention or in a secluded part where kids can be turned away from attending  just curious because the the open to all ages was on the page for the star wars event  but said nothing about ages on the drag crap.
the innocence of childhood is too fragile and short-lived as it is.  nothing should shorten that  and to actively try to do so is an awful thing to do.  kids are impressionable and try to determine what they should do by seeing what gets approval from the adults they look up to.  that s proven in psychology  and any adult who intentionally or unintentionally used their approval to manipulate children should be ashamed at the very least.  i don t care if someone is gay  bi  trans  whatever.  i have friends who are all of those things  and i love them just the same.  but none of them are trying to manipulate a child into being just like them.  their choice of partner and lifestyle is just like my hetero lifestyle  no one else s business.  keep it that way.keep up the good work melonie!  much love and respect to you for taking a difficult stance publicly and sticking to it!  god bless you!
what s next  an all ages strip show !  this shit is insane...
i like how you say  star wars is a drag...  it is very sexy lolit s just how you admit the truth.actually sw is a drag literally- not because of pronouns but because of quality
keep up the good work mel
i will never ever  buy another disney product  unless it is pre-owned   go see disney films in theaters  subscribe to disney   go to disney s parks and resorts. i am so incredibly done with disney s crap! hecking wokies   groomers! they make me sick!
the kitty in the background at the endits so cuteim a sucker for animals man
hit that like button if you think melonie has the most adorable laugh
if the gym in the middle of the court yard with a management office inside of the same building were open. we would have these living alone middle aged women occupying every 1 bedroom first floor apartment with no kids talking about how theyre cutting rent deals with some young front desk guy at the apartment office...
love your videos.
keep up the good work
this is just sickening with what our world is coming too !
reminds me a line from warcraft 3  this urn contains your father s ashes  arthas! what  were you planning to piss on them one last time before leaving his kingdom to rot  disney being arthas of course and the urn containing the remains of star wars.
children  on the other hand  were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations. the family had become in effect an extension of the thought police.    george orwell s 1984it has to start somewhere.
melonie mac go boom on netflix s generation drag ...my thoughts exactly. keep the  drag  in adult spaces.
i put the blame on parents.  all ages anything can exist but if parents stopped taking their kids then it would cease to exist.the parents are messed up.  we need more child welfare workers investigating parents.
im honestly speechless with this disney wot the bloody hael are you doing
i m glad to see you re disgusted by desmond is amazing and those drag story tellings   often with those guys having their junks out in full view  .  adult entertainment is for adults!
sadly that s the next step watch
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners
cross the street to universal to see the new super nintendo land.
you know  we should take something they love and warp it into something they hate.
this is the work of darth sidious.
at first i thought   good job all the star wars characters are usually pretty well dressed and covered up  but then i immediately got a flash of princess leia and jabba the hutt and now i can t get the image of some giant obese man painted green holding chains in which a drag princess leia is attached and yeah..... just disgraceful imagery i wish to un see . kids should never be exposed to this crap but each day we see them taking a step closer and closer in robbing children of their innocence.
if someone wants to see a drag show  they can watch me drag deeeez nnnnevermind.
sadly shit like this just makes me think   you know what  the apocalypse is looking more and more appealing.
wouldn t mind a star wars lingerie show as long as it isn t marketed somewhere where children are likely to find our about it let alone allow children in.
clown world keeps on getting clownerear  melonie mace 2023
killer tattoos!!!!
to quote darth vader  nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
if you have to make your entire identity about your sexuality you live a very shallow and most likely boring life.
they argue that drag isn t a fet!sh. same cultists argue  children can consent.
all this drag show nonsense and woke bs has to stop. those things need to stop ruining everything us geeks love. i just hope they don t go after my favorite music genres metal  country and kpop next.
this is just messed up. this was what the whole thing in florida s schools stopping the grooming by strangers. one thing the governor did to protect children and disney took the side of the criminal
bahahahaha  the drag racers  i love it.
i quit when the credits rolled on the theatre at last jedi. i used to read the books  follow lore channels  i knew at that moment star wars was done  and i hated disney. they haven t changed my mind  this definitely doesn t help.
these people know exactly what they are doing and disney is okay with that.
that jedi has a dong saber!
it s easy to brainwash a kid to be or do anything you want  for the most part.  in africa  one person brainwashed a bunch of kids to think they are soldiers  and they did horrible things because of it. pray to god to protect the kids.
just reading that middle paragraph made me think like  . . . . . . . . what !or rather  it made me wanna flip a freaking table  and i don t mean with the force
nope this is something else entirely.
watch me drag deez... banana peels because red shells.
drag isn t a fetish  its an adult performance art. it can be toned down to fit a theme that is family friendly  but current times prove no one has the forethought to do that. so as it stands  its an adult art.
@aizle101  i can t imagine any child not being confused by men in dresses caked with makeup. i can t imagine a healthy adult being comfortable with children at such events.children at these events misinterpret how to behave to get praise from adults.  every child involved with pride will continue to increase stigmas  that had almost died a decade ago.
@mona mia  any child would  but remember  if this was family friendly  and they re acting something out  it has to be within the confines of what a kid can understand. re-enact a childrens story with appropriately themed costumes dresses would be much better than the drag queens  usual material. none of that gender understanding shit. just a regular children s story. this would fit within the confines of what the lgbt and drag are claiming thwir performances are.but that s me playing devil s advocate and trying to make a plausible solution. i can t expect that from most people today.
@aizle101  yeah  bdsm wear is no fetish either... just leather and or spandex  right we re not talking about crossdressing for comedic fun here buddy.
@commdante  you didn t read the comment. i said it could be  but no one can do it because they want to still have their brand of saucy on top of the performance. and why would anyone bring fetish gear to a kids event  that s fucking insane. i gave an idea that fulfilled the requirements for it to be family friendly. i didn t say that it s happening currently. there s no proof of that.
@windyebowerstone  have you never seen mrs doubtfire or a bugs bunny cartoon  that s family friendly drag for comedic purposes
@marcuskahn3783  what are you on dude  drag is when a man dresses as a woman for entertainment and that s literally what those movies are. how is someone wearing a costume bad and how does it hurt kids
@emilcarter3913  and now that i give the ending of ms doubtfire some more thought  it still isn t the same. no one is cheering that he s cross dressing. that is not the point of the story. no kids will be putting on granny costumes.he learned to use the character he created to help children. he isn t dressed in glitter and rainbows reading inappropriate books to toddlers. he isn t on a stage strip teasing or simulating s3x.how can you think these are comparable
@mona mia  i wouldn t call that drag either. it was a disguise first  costume second. my point was it can be done with an age appropriate theme and performance  not that it is being done today. jesus  you guys want apeshit on this.
@aizle101  i was responding to the other guy.
@mona mia  ah... well  the explanation is for the other guys then. sorry about that.
@marcuskahn3783  i watch her videos because she makes some good points in many of them  but i whole heartedly disagree with this one
@marcuskahn3783  youtube hid your comment x_x
@marcuskahn3783  okay that s you. i disagree with her. that one person being vile like that doesn t mean all drag queens are dude. plenty of straight people do the same stuff  but that doesn t mean all straight people are bad. use your common sense.
@marcuskahn3783  didn t say it was an isolated incident  just said that it isn t something exclusive to people that do drag. again  straight people do it too so the problem is the individual in both cases. common sense.
@marcuskahn3783  people who talk about women the way you do are often incels. guarantee you don t have a gf rn. i don t use dating apps since i m not single lmao
no to all of that. if  no you  is the best you can do then i m not interested in talking to you
@emilcarter3913  asking for adult events and spaces to remain adults only shouldn t be an issue. drag is not for children. they misinterpret what is appropriate behavior.how are you comfortable with children  not only witnessing  but participating in drag   where are straight people doing this in the west so publically   they should also be disbanded and face the full force of the law.no people should be legally protected from criticism or mockery.
@windyebowerstone  bro it s clothing and costumes with full body coverage it isn t inappropriate or sexual.
@windyebowerstone  that s not all drag shows dude. they obviously also wouldn t allow that at a family event either pls use some common sense. i don t think you actually know anything about drag since it is  again  just people dressing up as members of the opposite sex. any performance art can be catered to the audience it s intended for to make it appropriate for said audience  but i guess coming to that conclusion would require too much critical thinking for you. i should ve expected as much from someone with an anime pfp
@marcuskahn3783  ytube just hid your comment too x_x
@windyebowerstone  i m just sick of ytubes pro communist attitude towards anybody with a working brain adding their two cents.
@marcuskahn3783  rumble is looking hotter by the day
@marcuskahn3783  they always eat their own indeed
@windyebowerstone  and contract a severe case of  dysentery that ll cause em to all shrivel up n turned into dust before getting scattered by the four winds.
anything  after the force awakens is not cannon to me.
george lucas shouldn t have sold sw to disney. i m so heartbroken.
all the organisations associated with this event by saying nothing or attending are condoning this  just as disney are.
awesome! twerkingland and dragland at disneyland.
if they make omega a  trans kid  i am gonna throw away everything star wars i own.all of it.don t you dare disney. that crosses the line.
probably getting inspiration from harvey korman s drag performance in the holiday special.
this is hands-down the worst move that disney could have conceived  let alone set in motion.  i ve a feeling that all of europe is about to have its own disney v florida brouhaha.
remember when more star wars content was the expanded universe  i wish lucas never sold his ip. we could have got sword of the jedi and more!
remember folks  kids being able to see it is a feature  not a bug.
i know...... it s sad to watch what is happening. i sent you a pretty long email. i hope you received it. god bless.luke 17 28-30likewise also as it was in the dayes of lot  they did eat  they dranke  they bought  they sold  they planted  they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodome  it rained fire and brimstone from heauen    destroyed them all euen thus shall it bee in the day when the sonne of man is reuealed.matt 24 37-39but as the dayes of noe were  so shall also the comming of the sonne of man be.for as in the dayes that were before the flood  they were eating  and drinking  marrying  and giuing in mariage  vntill the day that noe entred into the arke and knew not vntill the flood came  and tooke them all away  so shall also the comming of the sonne of man be.
the ends of days is near really near i m tired of this world no movies shows are safe anymore
i m ready at this point for god to break his promise  take the rainbows away  and just start raining. don t stop raining until the world is flooded again  and everything is washed away. we are unfortunately recaning the peak of our decadence.
society is in the toilet alright i m just gonna say it . cuz this type of stuff is meant for adults and even as a 20 year old i find this stuff uncomfortable cuz in essence it s essentially grown men walking around in stuff that even barbie would be ashamed to wear. also the fact that they re trying to normalize this stuff is gross cuz i bet you that the people participating in this aren t even fans and just want an excuse to dress up as rey or princess leia in heavy makeup. i feel like god is just sitting up in heaven shaking his head in utter sadness and disappointment in seeing what exactly has happened to his most prized creation  human being .
it makes perfect sense. their goal is normalize their fetish proclivities.
i have to say i was relatively unbiased on this until you read the actual announcement  which is strait out written from a self-delusional perspective... and i would agree that this event is as much suited for children as a cosplay contest at comiket. not that i have a problem with it in general. i m not into it  but it s not really my business  what other people do in their free time or how they live their lives.
like professor farnsworth said i don t want to live on this planet anymore
i want to know what jeremy and ryan are going as.  you know they re going to be there.  hey
i will likely be in the minority in society  and possibly be criticized for daring to believe that there should be limits  so beit.  this does not mean that art should be censored  artists need the freedom to explore while they create.  but i desire the freedom to not be forced to consume garbage  even when someone decides to call it  art .  drag is not the same as satire.  i enjoy satire  but drag is forum of artistic expression that society would be better off without.  two examples  benny hill show  1969-1989   satire to the extreme  funny  rude and stupid and even alittle thought provoking  especially at 11pm.  and then consider victor victoria  1982   starring james garner  one of my favourite actors  and julie andrews  everyone loves her   with screenplay by blake edwards  wonderful material   multiple oscar nominations   1 win ... i haven t watched it  and won t.  some things you just can t  unsee .  no interest in female male impersonators   again my choice    even if it is julie andrews.when companies like disney allow contamination like this to their programs  we no longer have choice  because who travels to major events and doesn t attend everything their schedule allows.  they are reducing our choice to never going at all.  that in itself does not expand your market  but will actually reduce it.  if you re not sure what i m talking about  it s like going to a local baseball game to find out the pregame show will be strippers.  so maybe you re the type of  it s not all bad  people -- would you buy a dozen eggs when you know 1 of those eggs will probably kill you  no  you just don t buy the eggs.  drag does not belong in front of children  or anyone else .
last desperate acts of kathleen  they re really showing their true colors now
this is not a drag show. it s a panel about drag elements in star wars. omg. they believe din djarin is drag simply cuz he s on a journey of self-discovery. padme is drag cuz her costumes were elaborate. asajj is drag cuz she s a sexy punkish somewhat androgynous vixen. this is effing nonsense. just when you thought woke couldn t get worse.
melanie i have a feeling that anna thatstarwarsgirl will be making the story about this i bet she ll be furious lol
that s very different than the title
i remember when the twitterverse had comments about star wars not having female fans...the toxic manimals kept the ladies away.
@theunknowngamer5477  oh wow a fellow gamer i really don t know much about the twitterverse because i don t have a twitter account lol but i do know this i stand against political correctness on any platform i don t give a crap what platform it is
@michaelcoulter1725  i welcome you to this domain.inside this place  be careful of what you wish for.names and identification labels are not real people or events.this area we are allowed  the public sharing  it is a community.jump in  have a cosmic view of any place.  it is worse  outside.
@theunknowngamer5477  understood
always going after the kids. worst part is that they ll tell you that it s not grooming but instead they just wanna make sure that kids are aware of these lifestyles and that they should explore them instead of adhering to outdated societal notions. basically they re saying  we re not trying to brainwash your kids to think like us  we re just trying to mold and influence your kids  so that they think like us  which is the same thing.mind you  i ve got nothing against drag in itself but i absolutely detest people s insistence on trying to push their sociopolitical beliefs onto children that are too young to think critically about it. it s fked up.i love that they mention how relevant drag is to star wars and the examples have absolutely nothing to do with it within the context of the franchise. it s so paper thin.
drag in a all ages space is very concerning  sure if you are an adult and want to watch it then go for it it. however kids are very impressionable and easily influenced  they should not be exposed to this.
the fuck  - cliff steele
what s funny is that a lot of the people celebrating this are the same people who applauded disney for removing all slave leia images from star wars merchandise after they bought the franchise. when it s a woman wearing a revealing outfit it s considered objectifying  but when it s a trans person it s considered brave and empowering.
when our kids were little  disney was default ok. no more. i wonder what walt would say
tgj is not even a real star wars fan  he s just using star wars as a platform to talk about excessive amounts of lgbt propaganda and all of his viewers are apologists that think the same way he does. we need to keep drag out of star wars.
thank you for telling me not to go to celebration this year. stop showing kids drag. drag race should never be apart of star wars. drag was never apart of star wars and drag should be it s own separate thing. drag is really sexualized even in ru paul s drag race. let kids be kids. dressing up as a star wars character is not a gay awakening it s cosplay. i m so tired of these people trying to invade our gaming  film culture and ruin the fun for everyone and making it always political. this is not empowerment. this is trying to brain wash children. if i see a drag jedi in a video game or film i m done with star wars. drag people never existed in star wars  because it s in space. yes we accept dragness but don t invade our communities . it s our community not yours. sure your welcomed to like star wars but it s getting to the point we re children are being exposed to sexual fetiches.
disney has given into the dark side.
i almost have a counterpoint but i really don t and i don t want one! lol.but i can say from experience a drag show is great fun for a kid.let me explain- growing up in spain we would go to this beach town every vacation chance we got. we always went to this one restaurant that had the most amazing spaghetti of my childhood and a show. the show was this comedian that performed in drag. his performance  however  was singing and jokes dressed as a flamenco dancer. i guess i would liken it to an eddie izzard show- dude is being funny with lipstick on. i ve been on the receiving end as a child  under ten  of men dressing as women and performing. that being said  it was a specific act appropriate for the environment and really classy and entertaining. and definitely easy for a young un to understand oh hey a dude in a costume being funny. cool.what s happening these days is an absolute abomination. drag used to be an actual thing. normal  straight  many times  very happily  married men getting dolled up and going out on a stage and people would laugh and clap and have dinner and drinks and a generally good time.that s been corrupted by the worst evil into what we see today. it s becoming a federal assault charge to call a drag queen a dude in a costume.of course  these days it s more than that. it s sickos pretending to be what they re not.
i m not even surprised anymore. you could tell me disney live aborted a baby and used it s blood to create their newest cartoon and i wouldn t bat an eye.
this is definitely disgusting and wrong. has disney lost their freaking minds over drag queen shows over star wars celebrations  anyway i don t think that mr. disney wanted this ever happened ever if he was still alive today. anyway also god doesn t want every men to dress up as women to do this stuff for disney company ever  ok melonie. anyway i just don t want this ever happened ever again for disney company  ok melonie. anyway i just want to tell you what my thoughts are on bout this video topic of the disney and drag queen issue crap  ok melonie. anyway i also want to tell you that you did a fantastic job with the interview with jay from drunk3po yesterday  monday   last night. anyway great job  on the interview melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
here in the uk we have a form of theatre called  pantomime  which is for children family and we see it as harmless  silly fun  or cringe depending on the performances . i share your concerns for any ip being used to push a specific agenda which has no place in said ip  nevermind half-assed cash grabs   however an all out drag show performance sounds like a ton of fun! i ve been on this planet for almost four decades and as a heterosexual man- i can honestly say i ve never had more fun or felt more at ease than when in nightclubs run by drag queens. never once as a child did i see a man dressed up as a woman and think  that s what i want to be!  and rocky horror was one of my favorite movies growing up right along side jungle book and lion king. i saw my fair share of those that were groomed though and i myself at the age of 10 had to turn around to someone that attempted to groom me and tell them that i wasn t falling for it. those groomers i saw were teachers  friends of the family  instructors coaches  even the parents of said child... never judge a book by its cover.
thor love and thunder flick   grooming.
drag doesn t automatically mean it s going to be overly sexual it s just men in makeup   dresses not that deep imo
why would someone get a tattoo of lara croft without legs  this makes me very sad.
i am a trans gender women  male to female  who is bisexual and i ve loved your videos especially your tomb raider videos i m a huge fan of those videos  i always love to see your views on it  i m also a huge drag lover i love drag and the show drag race. i agree that drag shouldn t be shoved and forced on children or anyone who s not interested because it s wrong to force people to do and watch things there not  comfortable  watching  that is true but to say that because someone in a wig who wants to entertain for kids and people of all ages is grooming is so wrong and makes me sad to know that thats what you think about drag. drag is not for all ages like 90  of drag queens or kings do adult shows and numbers   but that s not to say that there aren t some drag queens who enjoy performing and sharing drag with kids  if a queen is performing for a child audience i m sure they will tailor the performance and the act to make sure that it s not like you say  perverted . i honestly do enjoy your videos and i take on board your opinions on the matter but this video has provoked some vile comments about what should happen to these performers and honestly for all ik you probably agree with them. i probably won t continue supporting this channel further since a video like this is pretty damaging so i m not going to support something like that  but best of luck with your channel and i hope you enjoy the new tomb raider projects  this is just a point of view for a 17 year old girl who s grown up in a christian very none inclusive family .
what s the issue  it s literally just people dressing up as starwars characters. i ve seen guys dress as leia for years and it s never been an issue. drag is also not really something that has anything to do with pride since it s literally just dressing up in several layers of clothing and really has nothing to do with sexuality.plus so many of us have seen men in drag in movies for years. remember mrs. doubtfire  how about white chicks  or that one scene from the live action cat in the hat  maybe madea rings a bell  let s not also forget bugs bunny dressing in drag constantly. anyone else remember adam sandler in jack and jill  these are all examples of how drag isn t a sexual thing it s literally people just dressing up as an extremely exaggerated woman.it s not nor will it ever be as deep as you re trying to make it. none of these starwars characters are even in revealing outfits so please explain to me how it s even remotely sexual.
so far 3 people are talking about this including you....thank you for talking about this.
this comment may be hated but i don t see the major issue with this kind of show  at least in the aspect of how it used to be. i mean  i have been out of school for 15  years  but it was present in my school  mainly the drama theater group but also choir  band  and sports clubs joined in.now though  i kinda have to agree. it has become more  outgoing  and along the lines of crass and who can one-up the other in the  adult  categories.  i hate avoiding yt filters
disney will also be handing out complimentary puke buckets
logic!!!!!
@glibfacsimile  that s opinion your  just do a little more research and you ll find that born women do drag  trans women and cis women have been doing drag as long as men have  so it can t be that offensive if women are partaking in drag.
@jamietrinder3881  shakespeare was in drag  and so was monty python. but modern drag is fetishist and you know what i m talking about.
@glibfacsimile  i 100  know what your talking about  but it s not fair to generalise and say all drag is very  scandalous  and provocative  cuz that isn t the case. performers like violet chachki do a lot of burlesque and adult shows they are targeted at adults and people under 18 are not aloud in to watch  but some queens like nina west are very pg and do a lot of family friendly kids shows  it s ultimately up to the parents if they want there kids to  exposed  to drag  the queens aren t forcing them  it s the families. just like this star wars celebration you don t like it don t watch  there s tomb raider games i don t like so i just don t play them i  play a different one  i honestly don t see the hidden deep agenda.
@jamietrinder3881  drag itself is not scandalous or proactive but drag shows are and you know absolutely what i m talking about. i get what you re saying but i do not think that the fetishistic aspects of it are healthy. desmondisamazing for example is sickening to watch.
@glibfacsimile  but again your just generalising that all drag is fetish and kinky  which it s not it s like saying all whites people are racist or all men are homophobic  yes some might be but there are others who are not  not all drag is one thing every drag queen has there own persona and own type of performance types  a lot of drag on drag race is very out there and hyper feminine  you know dressing up as big breasted ladies  but that doesn t mean there getting turned on because there acting like over the top women  it just means that s there drag and there in touched with there feminine side  if the show was truly rude and sexist towards women trust i wouldn t be aloud on the air in 2023  you know how people love to cancel anyone or anything right now.
@jamietrinder3881  i promise you i m not generalizing all drag. only the fetishist shows that contain sexuality. no one had a problem with drag in movies or humor. it s the ones that wear skimpy outfits in front of children.
@glibfacsimile  but what kids shows have you seen where they wear skimpy clothing  you know a lot of kids have grown up with over the top women in skimpy clothing  like i grew up with lara croft i don t see an issue with her clothing but she was on car commercials where she wore bikinis and that s not see as forcing kids to see sexualised women    i just think it all comes down to the parents  if they allow there kids to se star wars drag go for it and if they don t allow there kids to be exposed to it that s fine to but as they grow older they will see drag anyway it just depends on if they are aloud to see it or not. personally i wouldn t watch drag race with a child because there humour is very adult  but i would let them watch drag queen tiktok of them getting ready or harmless this that ik won t have vulgar language and saying in it.
@vulcanh254  i m the creepy one sure pal  if that makes you feel better than having to realise that drag is a thing then crack on.
@jamietrinder3881  i know it s a thing. just like adult videos and horror movies are a thing that kids can get traumatized by. obviously.i just don t know why you think kids should be exposed to atrocities.
@vulcanh254  i m not even going to try with u  the other guy and i actually had a conversation about are views and it was a sensible conversation and there was no real attacking  i ll only reply further if you wanna try and have a conversation not talking about how i should raise kids and how bad drag is  if i was to have kids which i won t trust the only traumatising thing i can think of making a kid partake in is church  you wanna talk creepy think about that. good day.
you deliberately misrepresented the final sentence its reference to being  influential  is about star wars not the panel itself. it s a panel at a convention unlikely to be a  main stage  event. children may be present at the convention but how do you possibly equate that to attending a particular panel  shouldn t their parents be supervising where their children go assuming disney itself isn t putting restrictions on who attends particular panels.this is the worst kind of clickbait video demonstrates an utter lack of research  misinformation and is nothing but intolerance and hate.
man ya ll need to relax. ru paul s not a groomer  drag queens aren t groomers. it s a just a cultural thing   a form of expression   empowerment. and even if there has been a few that really have done that  you can t throw em all under the bus. plenty of priests have been caught  doesn t mean all priests are like that  most priests are good or at least alright people. you can t let a few bad apples spoil the bunch. and it s not like if some kid sees a drag queen than that kid s gonna become one or become gay  that s ridiculous. kids can be impressionable  but not that impressionable. if one of your biggest concerns for your kid is seeing a drag queen  then that kid will be just fine. i grew up around drugs   violence  and i turned out fine. there s plenty of people from the hood who see drive-byes  death  drugs  and all sorts of other bad stuff  that turn out to be good people. and ya ll think drag queens are the root of all evil  please  i m sure every kid in ukraine would rather go to star wars drag queen convention  than have to deal with the hell they re living in   going through. it s like movies that are cool with death   murder in it  but god forbid you better not show a naked woman or say the f word. lots of people are offended by harmless inconsequential things  while being completely apathetic to real travesties  it s ridiculous. the same type of people that complain about cancel culture   woke mobs ruining everything  sure do seem to complain a lot about stuff that shouldn t be an issue. this is fine. if you really wanna be some social justice warrior go donate to real causes  real charities. stop kicking up a fuss over something like this  cause there s nothing wrong with it. a little weird  never thought i d see drag   star wars officially incorporated together but it s fine. so would a lingerie star wars showcase  that i d really like to see.
cole train with the cameo!!
an this is why  i stopped going or taking my kids to disney. dont know if my ex is doing the same thing  but i know i sure wont take them.
disney s star wars burlesque show  kids edition  up next...
preach sister.
this is madness
for the love of obi wan what is happening
@melonie mac go boom  when disney bought star wars and heard that  drag racing inspired concepts in star wars   disney got the wrong drag  and now drag down star wars.
back in the old day ....i can t even say what would be done to that flock of chicken hawks at disney.  i d be banned off of youtube.
i wonder what george lucas thinks of this
i have a bad feeling about this ..
is it just me or have the drag shit have been pushed supremely hard this month or is it just me  i swear this entire month all i have seen stories involving drag queens and children at least twice aweek  really trying to make it obvious that they are trying to increase those numbers in the lgbt
so many people are out of touch with reality.
i mean  the first thing i noticed seeing the  star wars celebration  logo  is the upside down cross symbolism..
i used to watch 3 to 7 movies a month and even paid for a movie pass at one point. now  i am done with hollywood. next movie i watch will probably be the next evil dead. it will be rare i attend the cinema.
as long as they aren t parading around like a stripper i don t see a problem.
i m looking forward to see the financial downfall of disney
oh yeah.i see this turning out juuuuust fine  no consequences whatsover....surely.
i saw the drag show on tv  while browsing  channels and yes it is very sexual definitely not appropriate for kids.what is wrong w disney! ! jesus please help this world!
hey your makeup looks really good today!
and then they say we re just bigots for not liking  and being forced down our and throats and children too !
yeah watching multiple seasons of drag race makes it very clear that it is not meant for kids even outside of all the blatantly obvious reasons
will this actually be on disney grounds  or just some hotel
millstones around necks. now.
this is rage inducing.
if i didn t look this up i would have thought it was satire from the onion or something
and just like that super mario world destroyed disney. good job disney. you just lost a good amount of money!!
you know what s new avengers in drags and instead of fighting a common foe they will be fight over who gets kinky with who on the team. the future is bleak.
tolerate  appreciate  celebrate  participate . overton window is going full throttle nowadays. for such an ip about space  the agenda is so grounded to earth beneath tru hell.
also i forgot to mention melonie drink so water.  also have you seen sara gonzalez videos about drag shows for kids in texas. her yt show is the news and why it matters on blaze. not to push another yt channel just for background information. stay safe. take care. have fun.
it s like everyone forgot that drag shows were basically gay strip shows.  male burlesque.  it s like calling it  drag  somehow opened the door for grooming children   somehow.
this is absolutely disgusting. if people want to do drag that is their choice  but children should not be involved.
next sw episode  pride of the force and next the last gaylord
get em mel
because it s politicsand i hate all politics  it always imposes other people s ideals on people.
god have mercy.
booby fett. martha vader. princess lee  damn it . i m guessing in a few years  kids will go to disney land etc and see dudes dressed as their favourite princesses...
some isn t a movement  it s a cult
amen!
want you.
facts
thank you  jay!  d
went to go look at the original tweet and im already blocked
mostly agree but the big criticism is gonna be  no problem with slave leia fetish stuff but only this   mainly cause that wasn t in the movie as a good thing. it was as awful as they could get in a kids movie to show something bad . i don t agree them but that will be the low hanging fruit.
a drag show is jo different then black face  really but one is pushed
yeah  um...remember when we just watched the movies
ok so once alot of bad things happen due to this trash  it will b to late cuz the damage is already done and we cant blame them.... it s our fault cuz we have allowed this to happen cuz most ppl are so afraid of angering these pplwe need to stop this nonsense
why they say that padme is a drag queen too  my last movie was the clone wars and that was when it was new on cinemas. she married with a man  who happened to be a mass murderer prick . what s going on
they them   we are borg
thanks!
this is disgusting and downright horrible.
please make a video on how drag is also satanic.
melonie good video and thoughts on the dead or alive games
gynocentric!lop sided cultures are like this!...........and don t forget androcentric!
why why seriously  why why   our stock prices aren t low enough for us to either force a buy-out  or take the company private. yet.
its not about money anymore.they have money.they wont stop.
good thing their customer base is so small. who s going to pay insane prices to be treated like trash at their parks
absolutely disgusting disney.
groomers will continue to groom.
the times grow dark in these last days. this world will be desolate before 3000 c.e.
point raken fortune choker.
i hate the modern world.i ll take dysentery and polio  just get me out of this hell.
it might just be me but there s a difference between cosplay and full out sexual fetishism.
this is disgusting  disney are sinking to a new low!
if a single kid becomes a drag queen because of seeing one  it too much! that s grooming!
plz don t corrupt star wars 10 53
they re  stretching it to meet their political agenda.
poor kids are targeted more than ever to get brainwashed
so is disney gonna get sued right
well  still better than the last jedi lol
this is gonna get out of hand.
kwasade for the algorithm.
nothing will change until feces start hitting the butter.
people need to stop supporting disney.
someone needs to sacrifice themselves into a volcano or something to fix whatever is happening to our world. i d do it but i ve got work tomorrow.
and im finally done with star wars
they keep graping the corpse of star wars
these people are demons roadhouse
completely given up on disney at this point. i hope desantis keeps his boot on their throats at least in florida.
we explained what the red line was. they crossed it anyway. what now
disney has their following so let them fall on their lightsaber.
man what the hell is going on rn
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners
is it sad that i m not surprised
disney is slowing becoming ea games. soon they re gonna make star wars into a playhouse series like bear in the big blue house. where s the south park mickey mouse when you need him lolea disney  own everything
disgusting   they re really leaning into  the grooming!
such a shame what the world has come too
how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old mouse
star wokes.
in a galaxy far far away from children
every day we stray futher from god... as he runs the hell away!
damn them
12 09 kitty!!
boycottdisney
hiii. havent seen your response yet to the rumor that embracer sold tomb raider to amazon
100 percent agree.. why don t they bring in bdsm. kids might like leather and masks..  kids have never been so confused about who they are than right now in america. not everyone is gay or trans. but that is the in thing in schools right now  it s cool  and friends are influencing friends to believe that they can be like each other. confusion and molding little minds is not ok. when  is it going to stop
satan s working overtime. get your eyes on jesus y all!
this is why private schools exist.
who even asked for this  i don t have anything against drag people or crossdressers  but i am 90  sure that nobody wanted this. what is disney thinking
i would love to purge disney from existence with my death angel hammer justice.
should ve known that ever since disney bought lucasfilm  that it would gradually get worse for the star wars franchise over time. especially  when you have to hear about this  drag shows  now  just  no. leave the kids out of this.all downhill from here  folks.
padme is drag  is she not inspired by geisha makeup the same way the original trilogy was inspired by samurai films
nothing says  star wars  quite like this. jfc  disney should never hat got hold of that ip.
i just made a video about amazon s involvement with tomb raider just a couple days ago  it more or less is the same points in that video
i love drag but not for star wars wy wy wy
wow  stunning and brave. disney is truly aiming to surpass sodom and gomorrah.
i just skimmed gayle rubin s  thinking sex  article and i am a lot less tolerant of this stuff now. i hope that most people who cite to queer theory don t subscribe to such theories but i am pretty suspicious now.
we re going to need new cuss words to describe this sh!t  because this is some next level disgusting.
we are in hell this is disgusting
walt is spinning in his grave.
boom go  d
what a drag...                        shikkamaru probably
in the same way we don t let kids go to burlesques  we should keep them away from drag shows.
remember when disney had the christian-themed night of joy pepperidge farm remembers.
this is sick. and disney needs to put a stop to it. lucasfilm without george lucas is trash. star wars has nothing to do with drag or anything sexual. these people are monsters. 03 07 he s not a star wars fan.
good job disney... you have successfully destroyed every good thing about star wars. i went to celebrations 6 and 7 and they were wonderful experiences... why continue to ruin things that were once loved by millions
so  do i just say i am no longer a star wars fan
this wasn t what george had in mind in 1977it wasn t what he had in mind in 2012just stop  it s already dead.
are you disturbed melonie
it s all so tiresome.
this is just not right to cram this down everyone s throat  i don t think it is right for adults acting like this infront of kids. why does disney want to take kids to a strip show
oh kitty cat
they re animals
yikes!
this is fucking sick.the people who organized this event should be arrested on felony charges.
oh look!!!  another reason not to support or watch disney.  they re on a roll  i ll give them that much...
disney has just gotten more and more despicable over the years. star wars was my favorite  but it s dead to me now. make it stop!!!
kids don t need to be exposed to any type of adult stuff. also i don t need to know who or what type of people you do adult things with. i wish for the benefit of my grandchildren  people to stop pushing sex as an identity. i never watched the show with the drag queens in it. i have watched drag racing. you know with cars like stock  funny cars  top fuel  and all the other classes.
everything  that  was wholesome       kind about  disney   is officially  dead. let the company  go  bankrupt   it s  twisted  ideas  wither away.
this is a sad commentary on the world today  when disney has gone woke.  why the hell is children being exposed to this
why would kids be even interested in drag i don t get it  let kids be kids. you know i get questioned on my validity as a gay man sometimes because i don t even like see the appeal of drag. they re pushing this so hard it s getting ridiculous
its not the right wing families that worries me  but far left parents who can brings their children against their will 2 this sick n disturbing events
it s not for the kids it s for the reputation   company s don t care and activists are too hard headed and dense to understand
now their failure is complete. the ones that were still holding on for hope that disney was finished scrapping the bottom of the barrel with star wars and it might get better now. will leave. no matter how much baby yoda they re about to churn out  normal people will leave over this.
disney should be cancelld for this one...
i forgot this cancer doctor that helped cause our mother s death that had a very healthy heart the recalled medication that she lied about being new was recalled 7 times and was supposed to be given with a second medication after surgery my mother who was in stage four never had a second medication or ever had surgery. ignorance isn t a side effect if i was tom hanks that doctor would lose her doctors ph.d. and maybe be in prison with the drug company paying for the shit drug they sent after the ignorance of the doctor gave her something that she shouldn t have. if there is a god why does this god hate christian mothers who help people in need  i am wondering where are all the theist to help our mother out in a time of need when her death was not an accident and we went to the police and was told we had to file a civil suit when that cancer doctor caused her death  i m just curious where is her justice  my sister is trying to find a news outlet and lawyers but we haven t had much luck i bet your ass that if i was very famous this would be all over the media and handled very fast. last time i checked i thought murder or ignorance that caused murder was the police department s job i guess not. we have all the evidence proving what she did and that drug company still they don t care even with evidence proving guilt. i agree kids shouldn t be around drag adult entertainment either.
imagine blackface star wars day
we need to boycott this event and cancel this event by all means necessary it is wrong to groom kids and children and this drag thing at star wars celebration needs to be cancelled immediately shout out to you melanie for calling this out
what is happening in this world!
disney is going to hell for this
it feels like it s just the same what you look at so there s always some minority or traq thing
the closest thing to a drag queen in all of star wars is ziro the hutt.
nice mackerel tabby.
disney is not star wars.
we have passed  coexist  and gone into  conform  and  comply .
well then there s also the chef from the holiday special but that character is canonically female she s just played by a dude.
still miss my merry.
that s f d up.
savages!!!!!
hahaha...trans star wars huh    it reminds me of a cheech   chong skit
disney sold out
commenting to feed the algorithm
dude wtf
star wars still have fans  that aren t of the extreme left at least
what in tarnation.
boycott all disney products
i am glad i was never a star wars fan.
i m over it all  i just want the world to come to the agreement that  men  wearing nothing but a g string should not dance or be around children at all and that said children should not be encouraged to throw money at them. to much to ask
not for kids. stop this madness. protect our children.
the fact this is approved for all ages is shameful. drag is a sexual fetish no matter how they try to twist the definition. if there are children at this thing that is disgusting. bunch of perverts. thanks for covering this story because i went onto his video and everyone is praising him for this.
they re right. star wars is now a drag
i wonder when women are going to stand up and say   drag is as much an art form as black face. seriously  if a man can dress up as a woman  then it should be okay for a white person to dress up as a black person. but there s a history of white people oppressing black people   you say  as if there doesn t exist a history of men oppressing women. i mean  the worst thing that s really happened to this human race is selective morality.
why   why is drag such a necessity
walt is turning in his grave. disgrace to his legacy.
i support non woke indie films  books n comics.
w.....t.......f..........
what the hell has drag got to do with star wars
hey guys pick up a bible a lot things going on now is in there. just take a look.
and that is one of the reasons why western malthusian anglo-sorosian order must and will fall.
grim
i don t want to demonize anyone but how long are we as members of the public going to have to indulge in other peoples fetishes. the line keeps getting pushed  not about tolerance now  its acceptance then participation. i ve never had a problem if two consenting men want to dress up in black leather horse jockey outfits and do some kinky bdsm stuff  but keep it in the bedroom.
...just say no...
really  disney ! you think this is what star wars needs  drag ! ! y all really just can t stop taking ls.
that is why they fail.
disney will approve any thing that ruins star wars!
stop supporting this company cancel your disney plus. no reason to give these evil companies your money.
...drag...
what in the hell
evil groomers.
this is absolutely disgusting....
yeah at this point star wars is pretty much dead to me!!!
star wars is a dead ip in 2023. it may as well be flash gordon or buck rogers.
i am highly disappointed in your reporting on this. absolutely nowhere does it indicate what the show will entail other than it being drag  you then make wild assumptions  7 56  that kids will be present and  anything sexual in nature  kids should not be exposed to . really  how  you are making assumptions based on what you know  heard  or seen of previous drag shows  and then stating that it will happen. not one of us knows what the celebration will entail and yet you re already hating on it  at least let us see what the celebration even is.   i read the release twice to make sure i understood and it all seems like it ll be people putting on a fashion show  star wars themed with an intro on what drag is. it s an all-ages show  you really think that they ll allow nfsw in front of children  again  based on what  how drag shows operate in other places  the videos and comments you ve read  becasue disney went  woke   how exctly did you come to that conclusion  this tactic of insinuating and assuming reeks of how the  woke  operate.   remember them saying that  because someone buys a game  someone out there gets hurt and it ll be our fault   kinda similar to  no-drag shows cause then kids will be traumatized and add to the  grooming  agenda.   i don t take that crap from them  i won t take it from you.   i subbed to you because i enjoy your perspective on the culture and can t wait to hear your take on the lara croft show  but this assuming stuff is not cool. attack the content of the celebration   which has not been provided other than it will be drag   the people behind it not because they are one of the alphabet people  but based on ther ability to provide entertainment   and attack the actual clerabration itself since things can change from paper to the actual event. at the very least  let s wait to see what it entails before we make a judgment.
good luck with that.  i hope the event is uneventful.  six percent of europe is muslim.  one percent here.  they have not been known to be pacifists.  a word used to describe it is harsh.
just super mega ewwww lmao.
children getting involved in political issues is a problem it not just governments but people in general just the woke and politics crowd and some people just the average everyday living people hate it and want to shut these assholes up  today in the uk some school s are on strike and it politics and union s oh it a problem.
remember when they used to tell us  star wars is for kids  when we criticized last jedi  . so .. is it still for kids
this
they destroyed everything good that star wars once was now i just boycott everything they put out can not be trusted anymore...let them burn to the ground good riddance.

gr  mer5 out
i wish they would stop dragging children into drag
daily reminder that disney star wars is dead!
wtf is this
this has to stop. having drag shows for kids is disgusting. i know we can t stop this from happening but saying that this is a family event would make me never show star wars to my own kids. kids should be entertained by good stories  characters and the fun world these characters live in not forcing sexuality on them it robs them of their childhood. i m serious if this becomes a norm in family and kids media i will never have any involvement with disney or star wars or any property that is going to have forced sexual identity on kids
i ll never understand the appeal of this drag crap.
disney is dead
this degenerate train never stops. i can t believe these degenerates call this an art.
this is disgusting that star wars is showing drag to kids.  groomerawareness
it s a abomination not art!
12 10 cat spotted!
yuck  they won t be happy till they totally destroy star wars
star wars is dead
needing pronouns in your bio to be accepted in it s self is complete idiotic lunacy.
there are things worse than death! those who harm children or lead them to harm and do not repent and beg god for forgiveness shall experience the worst of all possible hells  forever!luke 17 2 kjv it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck  and he cast into the sea  than that he should offend one of these little ones. matthew 18 6 kjv but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me  it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck  and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. leave. kids. alone!i will die on this hill!
this isn t grooming. except for the conservative culture warriors pushing conservative identity politics.
jesus is coming soon. i feel it in my bones this world has become soddom and gamorrah 2.0. gods wrath will be felt on those who mocked and mock him. who reject christ and embrace debauchery and hedonism.
have you thought of removing your tattoos  the lord did not approve of using ink on our perfect bodies
the animal worship in this country is gettng gross

you tell the cam.................
