mark hamill is basically learning the meaning of the phrase  they always eat their own.  which is what happened to mark hamill after he basically preached political opinions on social media for years now. xd
it s was the force that made me do it. please forgive me.  - mark hamill  probably.
never bow downnever apologizenever bend the knee
it s hilarious how  the community   whatever the hell that even is  loved jk when she trotted out that nonsense after the books were done that dumbledore was gay but immediately turned on her when she wouldn t go all in with them.
woke on woke crime  let them fight  -eric july.
13 19  so true holy fuck. i had a whole friend group disown me bc i pointed out tue difference between trans women and biological women and pointed out their transphobia and erasure of trans people  and their unique experiences by saying trans women are  real women  so you re not wrong. 13 years of friendship dropped all because of a nuance that they got mad i was right about.these wokies only exist to be each others echo chambers tbh its insane. disagree with someone on 1 100 issues and you immediately become a  terf  or some stupid shit lol
congrats on the silver play button! your news analysis is very deserving of it. not a lot of based content creators in the gaming news pop culture space.
i know i ve mentioned this  but holy crap  melonie... look at how far you ve come lately!! picture it  just barely over a month ago  you were sandbagged by back-to-back issues of dehydration  hospitalization and stalker issues. now  flash forward to just one month later. in that short amount of time  you have...- created 20  new go boom! videos- achieved 100k  subscribers and got your silver play button- you started your og channel back up- you ve started streaming again- you taught everyone how to be gangsta in 2023all that in just one month s time  even after everything you went through in december. seriously  your rebound is amazing!and also incredibly inspiring.we live in a world that is tough  mean  and nasty. but with your content  i not only never have to worry about it being nasty... but i know it s also going to be god-honoring. in a world this tough and nasty  i can t begin to describe just how refreshing your content is. and the fact that you didn t let december bring you down  and you continue to work hard to consistently post fresh content at the rate that you do... i just hope that you know how appreciative i am for all that you do. and i m sure i m not the only one who carries that sentiment.so thanks  melonie. not just for all the hard work that you do... but thank you for who you are. thank you for being you  and for being such a winsome light
never apologize to a mob. you re not dealing with individuals who you can establish a relationship with. you re dealing with a soulless idea that has people in its possession.  - jordan peterson
it s amazing how they back pedal so quickly. you re so right melonie. nothing wrong with liking someone just because they have a difference of opinion. if i stopped liking people for that reason than i wouldn t like or follow anyone. and that would be lonely. you re speak truths. yes we only need validation from god. i hope you have a wonderful day melonie. stay cool and take care.
i m a newer sub but congrats on your silver play button!! thanks so much for your voice   i m an ex-leftist who recovered from the woke mind virus over the last year or so  and it s amazing to see someone actually speak out on this bs  that i used to contribute to  ugh  in gaming spaces where it s so rampant and any dissenting opinions are not only silenced  but punished.
congratulations on that silver there melonie. the plaque may be silver  but the way you frame things  your points of view  and who you are in general is gold! thanks for being a positive light during these times
a person is smart but people are dumb dangerous animals and you know it.  - agent k from men in black
without batman  crime has no punchline.  - joker after his archnemesis  departure
congrats on the play button!  your channel grows pretty fast atm. that s nice. i really liked your reviews  especially the witcher blood origin. your style to review stuff like that. more like that would be great  but i like your content in general. it covers a lot of entertainment. and you are very spirited  vivacious. some are a bit dry and boring  others try to be in high spirits  and it s annoying  but how you do it  that s far more natural and very entertaining. i really appreciate that  and the fast growing is totally deserved. i really hope  it continues  because i think  a lot of people would be interested. not just  because they agree. i am not that much into some things you cover  like comics. so maybe i wouldn t know how bad it is  for example with the joker  without your channel. and i think  that s important  and a lot of people don t know  that it s not just movies or shows  not just huge companies. it s most of entertainment  and a lot of companies do it. and it s a take over  it s corrupting  destroying  not creating. so i hope more people find your channel. congrats to the play button! greetings from germany!
i love rowlings response.  citation needed   definitely something a novel writer would come up with to jab at someone saying bs like that. lol. also congrats melonie!!   well deserved. you talked more about being a christian in your videos and i believe god has rewarded you. god is good!
and now 112k subs. alright. i used to think mark hamill was cool. until following him on twitter years ago. and found out he s just as crazy as the rest. actually i think i still follow him. hey melonie. you look amazing  even though i know you made this yesturday. but that doesn t change that fact.
congratulations on your play button  you deserve it for all your work and speaking the word. we ll try to get you that gold one! have an awesome day mel!
no mel .almost none of us know a person who genuinely suffered from gender dysphoria. some of us might know people who really want to suffer from this condition but frankly they are as you say trans-trenders
mark hamill is such a nice guy  he doesn t deserve this.
a bit like french revolution. even if it s  just  canceling. but with opressive extremists it s always like that. first they form a group and fight others. but growing bigger  they split. fewer  enemies   but they need the conflict. so now they attack former  allies  for not being extreme enough. sometimes that leads into a lot of insecurity. scared people. so they support the  strong  man  like napoleon. who whiped out what was before. exactly the same after ussr collapsed. instability. hunger  like in france. people starving. and the  strong  man afterwards. i just hope  it won t be like that now. i hope  they can t be big enough  to harm that much  and will split up and fight each other soon  instead of fighting most of society. so what happens is something  that always happens  and i hope  it continues. especially because they are easily triggered. so with them  if they start to fight each other  there should be a lot of entertaining meltdowns
he won t learn.
literally nothing happened
not feeling sorry for  him. at all.
forgiveness is a jedi trait  and i feast on the souls of jedi for amusement.
yeah  i d agree he was probably  forced  alright.  the force is strong with his pr manager.
probably

hamill s critics will show him as much mercy as ozai showed zuko.
@lonovavir  uh.. weird. nobody in the real world knows who that is or what the fuck that means.
@davemccombs  maybe so but i m not the one rampaging at people for their likes and tweets.
i heard that in george s voice. how did you do that  wizard
@harbl99  same
wait isn t bend the knee and bow the same thing
@misterhuman7759  no. bending the knee is falling to one knee in supplication or submission. near-equals bow  the lowly bend the knee.
if truth is our guide...nothing will stop us.
@andresanguianozuniga6798  tru
@misterhuman7759  kinda
never say... d - i - e...
@redacted2275  he gave an excuse why he liked which is kinda apologizing but jk did the opposite and started taking the piss
@chrisclinton5424  tru
and tell them some biological facts  and enjoy the meltdown
@leonnunhofer3453  fr
i have athrithis  i literally can t bend the knee.
@boomingbob1579  jk has been incredibly based lately
@milquetoaste7144  honestly every since she said wit is unfortunately now a hot take she just didnt care especially her   citation needed   comeback was glorious
ikr. the hypocrisy
yes  yes it is incredibly funny
i  really don t  love how nobody these days can separate the art from the artist.i can admit michael jackson made good musici can admit kevin spacey can act i can say oj simpson was a hell of a football player.the crazy thing is there isn t a single line of text in the thousands of pages of this series that directly targets trans people  or even hints at anybody being gay from what i understand she just pulled that dumbledore thing out her ass after the books were already done. also  context  these books were written in the late 90s-mid 2000s. very few people gen x and up are willing to die on the hill of trans rights.this is mostly young kids online  who probably don t read  who just know that she doesn t agree on the fundamentals of trans ideology and so they have a constant target they can go after. jk rowling is accessible via twitter but they could never cancel people who are already dead like jrr tolkein  cs lewis  or john locke...actually if we listened to the woke left the entire field of philosophy  anthropology and psychology would be scrapped because damn near all the people who contributed to it s building blocks have done and written many questionable things.
what s eric s real name
i second this in the highest degree and the utmost respect!
i agree and big respect to you for saying all that
i literally discovered this channel 10 mins ago- so can you inform how and if the stalker situation was resolved  the guy was old to be her dad ffs
i believe that being able to still like people you have disagreements with is important. because  as she said  a lot of people don t know that the thing they re supporting is evil. ignorance isn t evil. these people are redeemable.
welcome fren!!
this was a brilliant line.
that s a pretty gangster line.
that s fire
i don t believe god rewarded her subscribers for talking about being christian. i believe he rewarded her for deepening her connection
cringe.she s not going to sleep with you lol.
@call_me_gallagher  there are no ad homs.nice assunptions though but you re way off the mark in your attempts at a sick burn.oh and no matter how much you whiteknight  she s never sleeping with you.
facts
congratulations on your success mel. thanks for being a light when there s so much darkness around.
mark hamill once voiced a clown but now in real life  he is one as the punchline.
don t pander! be who you are and back it up with actions!
congratulations on the plaque. it is well deserved. treat yourself to five guys on me. keep up the good work.
very much agreed on getting along  even being friends with people who disagree with you. if there is mutual respect  it s all good. i have a great older friend who is very  progressive  to the point of ridiculous sometimes... but he is also sort of a mentor in my life  he has helped me incredibly much and we have a strong bond as friends. we often argue about stuff but it never gets offensive  we can always talk calmly and agree to disagree on stuff. it s actually very healthy to have friends like that  so you are able to get different views on things and not just live in an echo chamber.
hamill is learning that it s a lot easier to play a man in front of a camera than it is to be one in the real world. he has nothing to apologize for...and he shouldn t.
congrats. i wish i found your channel sooner  you are always brightening my days with your videos.
melonie mac go boom  the best channel for social commentary on this clown world.always based af
congratulations melonie  the world needs more like you.
congrats on the 100k subs  you deserve it. it s just refreshing to see women out there who aren t slaves to leftist ideologies and worldviews. i wish there were more out there  these days.
thank you for this  especially the part about being able to remain friends with people who have different views. we re all wrong about something at some point  and we likely will be again.a difference of opinion is not hatred.
be true to yourself  and don t back down. it s the only way to go. you look great melonie . congrats again on the play button.
also  you should never apologize to the woke mob as well!!and congrats on the 100 000 subs plaque! love watching your  take  on things! keep up the good work.
great work on the video melonie and congrats on getting that plaque. i hope one day to be as inspirational as you one day.
i really enjoy your videos melonie. congratulations on 100k and keep up the good work
it s amazing to see people like hamill simp for such a crazy group. he fed this beast and it has now turned on him.
preach  melonie--and congrats on your 100k play button!  you deserve all your success!
this is why you never apologize again and r even acknowledge them at all they will eventually attack regardless wot you did
it s crazy you ve only got over 100k which don t get me wrong  it s still a massive achievement but i just thought you had way more! haha so well done!
never apologize do better  is a lie
he went from joker to joke
@patrickhenry8425  not any more yesterday he just confirmed he stepped down as the clown prince of crime because the passing of the dark knight kevin conroy thay where the mardern day loroul and hardy of dc s cartoons
thank you so much!
thas  5 dollars a guy
unfortunately  his career is dependent upon his towing the line of the wokies.
@dragonballfanscantread2383  and yet here you are. contributing to the view count. thanks for all your support mate
@dragonballfanscantread2383  what do you mean by  simp . sorry  my english not so great  don t know all the new slang.

hey! i love watching your videos! it s nice seeing someone who shares the beliefs and interests as me  not only politically but religiously and nerdy as well .
my little sister came out as  non binary  whatever that is supposed to mean. as far as she is concerned  i support her decisions as an autonomous person  but inwardly i secretly wish that she can do the work to learn to love hersef the way she was born. it s bleedingly obvious that to me that this is just an expression of some deep-seated self hatred and it actually breaks my heart.i am very enthusiastic in my support for her and she has no idea how i really feel inwardly. if i were to raise it in even just a subtle way  i m sure she would cut me out completely
so many good points here  meloni. i have some friends who are woke  and still able to produce some nuanced takes at times. they call them hot takes lol. some of them are completely in agreement that a woman has a different anatomy than a man and there s no changing that so entirely. some of them are very young so i underatand the place where they are where the internet is giving them their talking points.on the other hand  there is someone who i just dont call a friend but someone they know is an absolute bully. i love william shatner. i might not agree with him on everything  but the man is a legend. when he went on blue origin  i was celebrating with my nerdy cousins and said something about on the group chat we have going with those woke friends. the bully came at me and told me he wished the capsule would be lost to the world and that we d never see him again. it was a little cringe so i made a comment on it in jest and this person exploded. i calmly i proceeded to explain how just because you disagree with someone in one particular issue  you need to dislike them. that one issue oesnt make an entire complex person. the bully explodded even more and called that a cop-out. i had to stop and just said nothing on the chat for days. others had to jump in to calm them down. i spoke to a friend  told her how it felt like being back in school and being bullied for being nerdy and a little weird  on the spectrum so.. a little weird it is . i went through that in the late 80s and 90s  having mean kids tossing my comics to puddles and knowing the worst thing you could have in your closet was a starfleet uniform. and the attitude from this person who is older than some of the woke kids  was just as appalling as that.that s when i knew i wanted nothing to do with this person  but i was curious.this person just had their top surgery recently and obsessed over one particular show and one particular character in an unhealthy way to the point they ve crafted their look to look like the character. gender disphoria is a mental issue that can spiral into many others and it s not being treated the way it should. worse still  in cases like these  it is creating ardent activists that i swear would punch me in the face if they could have simply for liking an actor...days like those  i wish i had a ticket to mars lol.
he s earned it. he s been a rectal chapeau to people on social media for years.
i had a similar experience.for many years i was part of sex-positive community  i m cis   hetero  though  but i liked the open ideas  etc... . when the  pandemic  hit i was a dissident  because i understood that our basic freedoms and liberties must not be taken from us and i was shunned.
i always valued your point of view melonie and find myself in agreement 99  if the time. thanks for all you do here and on twitch etc
congrats on the 100k plus.i have respect for jk rowling.  what she did with her creation and writing of harry potter is nothing short of phenomenal.  i may not agree with her stances on some issues but i do respect the fact that she seems to be consistent with her stances.  at least i have not heard otherwise.  as i said  i may not always agree with her but certainly respect her.   especially on the issues involved with transgender and preserving women s rights.  she has drawn the line in the sand on this issue and so far has resisted all the push to try to get her to cross that line.  good on her.mark hamil has now lost what little respect that i had for him.  if he had liked the tweet  received the backlash  and then came out and said    yes  i liked her tweet.  i happen to agree with her on this point and i will not apologize for it.  if you don t like it  there s the door.   i would have respected him for that.  instead he flip flops  backtracks  and tries to justify himself just to appease the  woke  minority.  no respect.
congrats for the plaque. i was with you from the start
darn  a young person with common sense. i have hope for the world.
congratulations melonie on the 100k subs! love your content  3
congratulations melonie!    well deserved!
imagine being run off the internets for a comment someone else made.
congrats melonie! while i m not super religious and wouldn t call myself right wing  i find how pop culture has been hijacked by activists and sjws disturbing and enjoy how you point it out. here s to the next 100 000 new subscribers!
i m more of a woman than you  sounds more like a cope than a burn...
congrats to you melonie for receiving your youtube award. anyway i am so happy for you. keep it up and i am so happy to follow you on your youtube boom channel and on twitter. anyway getting back to this topic of this video that i just want to tell you that there is no problem with liking or disliking someone else who has a different opinion like you or anyone else. anyway dislike is like disrespecting someone who is mad at someone else who did something wrong to other person and did something that the person didn t like to see that happened to other person who has been disrespectful to the person who didn t do anything wrong to the person who is being bullied by hate  ok melonie. anyway mark hamill was just trying to say that mark hamill likes jk rowling s tweets and he has no problem with what jk rowling has said in her tweets that make him stop disliking her by what she said in her tweets  ok melonie. anyway i just want to make a comment about this topic of your video and i just want to tell you that i am so deeply blessed and happy for you for receiving your youtube award for your youtube boom channel. anyway keep it up and i am so happy for you and i am so happy to follow you on your youtube boom channel and on twitter too. anyway also i just wanted to tell you that never bow down to wokies and never apologize for saying i m sorry and never bend your knee to anyone who is a wokie person  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today at home and hope you continuing to have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
congrats on the silver play button! here s to pushing for the gold!
a disturbance in the force. edits  congrats on 100k  melanie!
congrats on 100k  well deserved.
they cannibalize their own so much.
should thank jeremy at the quartering.  he s the one that got me to check you out  and been subbed ever since.  you deserve it.  looking forward to the next plaque.
this is a funny video thank you for it your reactions are priceless
congrats on 100k subs. i m so glad i found your channel. hopefully this will be a wake up call for luke skywalker  but i have my doubts.
i m more mark hamill than mark hamill will ever be. this is my truth that i speak to power.
when they came for everyone else and they also come for you in the end.
when will they learn  they will come for you too in the end  they will come for you even if you backtrack too. a very well articulated video.
it s like a homeless person saying they are more of a billionaire than bezos
congrats melonie for all your subscribers.
congrats on 100k  melonie    it s a sad day when men aren t trying to out man each other  but are trying to out feminine the women  i feel something went horribly wrong
i agree with your take on this subject from beginning to end of the video.
melonie is such a savage. this lady is bold in the face of this garbage. keep on going.
congratulations melonie!  i think you look beautiful no matter what outfits you choose to wear. thank  you for speaking the truth  not  a  truth. have a wonderful day.
agreed with everything. woke is evil and not only turning itself into sh   as someone said  but also turning other things that we liked into that.
hi melonie i hope you are enjoying your weekend thusfar.congrats for your achievement melonie i see you ll be collecting more of those achievements.takecare melonie
well deserved 100k subs...well done lass!  o
never pander  never give them an inch because they will take a mile. and never apologize. mean what you say and say what you mean. an apology is a sign of weakness and an admission of guilt. there is no  his truth  her truth  their truth . there is  the  truth  and anything that conflicts with the truth is a lie delusion.also it is refreshing to see young folk with common sense speaking their mind. props to you young lady.
the hivecluster is under attack! all the zerglings mobilizes towards the target but yes  he s now learning that zergs eat their own. whoever steps into the creep is labeled as enemy  no matter how buddy-buddy and fine you were with abathur and his hormones to incite mutations on the different strains of zerg
congrats on the silver play button! i hope to see you hit 200k soon.
loving the over 100k award. keep going! 200k ain t far off.
they eat their own like rabid wolves. leaving that side of politics was the best decision i ever made
you deserve every sub! congratulations!
may the force be with you. keep on rockin !
people need to understand two things.1.  people don t have to be perfect in order to love them.2.  people don t become perfect just because you love them.
grats on the silver button plaque mel!
so sad to watch his self-destruction
congrats on 100k melonie!
i have been trying to tell the people who pander to the woke mob that they ll turn on you. they turned on me as well. well i think we can finally accept mark hamill to our ranks  sort of.
there are some celebrities people where the disagreement does earn your unfollow or unfriend. many have attacked  anti vaxxers   attacked anti abortion people etc. to me  that s a line i can t cross. if you re doing that i m done. i can t be nice or brush it off. i m done. it s vicious and evil and i won t placate it.
well deserved 100k melo!
congratulations on the silver play button!
congrats melonie!  let the haters hate.  those abs be made of butter! lol
jordan peterson said it.. you capitulate to these people and they are just waiting  like vultures  waiting for you to slip up  so they can just rip you to shreds..
validation is like respect - it is earned  not owed. you can try to demand it  but all you ll get in return is lies and contempt.
feb 7 will be a year since your first video for this channel.  congratulations on a 100k in less than a year.
i m fat  but i don t sit outside gyms yelling  respect me!
i hope mark  like his fictional father sees the light.
congrats on the 100k plaque
funny thing is jason mamoa is such a nice guy he d probably see this video and make an effort to be your friend
gdi....i really love luke skywalker. mark hamill doesn t seem to understand what made that character so great. faith  hope  conviction...just three of the things that are quintessential luke. i still like him because he s got charisma in shows and live stuff....but this was bound to happen. i just hope he learns from this.
melonie is awesome. congrats on the 100k also
thank you so much girl
yeah same. that s usually how you figure it out. i m a bit glad melonie is able to express having gone through that. i m very ashamed of having spoken up for the woke  thinking i was getting the backs of my friends.
misery loves company  as the saying goes  they re miserable people  they don t want your apologies or acceptance they want you to be as miserable as they are.
mark  that s not possible!darth  search your feelings mark you it be woke!mark  noooooooooo!
just remember if they are mad at you  then you were right
i saw that tweet and i knew it was some type of woke backlash thank you for explaining
when has hamill had a thought that wasn t wrong think  he thinks as well as he drives.
i never thought some one was going to use  wrongthink  outside of 1984 and that is fucking scary
hey mac congratulation on your getting your 100 000 plaque award.
i left my gaming group a few months ago because after some time i finally got to a point where one of our people was so obnoxiously woke and a self-described communist  as well as a pretentious ass  that i finally reached the conclusion that going along to get along was no longer in the cards and walked. unfortunately  this led to the other 5 out of the remaining 7 people in the group despising me because i had the nerve to leave the group because of him. aka they were hefty lefty themselves and apparently they thought i hated them as well as him  which i don t hate him  but i simply couldn t tolerate him any longer . even though i did so in as mature a way as possible in a group email  apparently i still  worded it too strongly  even though i rewrote it several times  and they got bent about it. their loss  not mine.
damn  melonie mac preaching truth!  on a roll and making so many great points while be compassionate and real !
congratulations on earning your silver play button.
congrats for the 100k trophy
been watching some of the new gameplay videos for hogwarts legacy.  i like what i see. can t wait to come up with some creative combos with spells.
i commit wrong think every time i see melonie. yea. i m a simp.
congrats on 100k subs mel! woooooo!
good  he s a woke youtube who deserves it.
melonie goes boom mark hamill goes  oh crap
all it took for me to know woke stuff was bs was hearing  words are violence  and shortly after that hearing  silence is violence . so according to these people talking or not talking is an act of violence. as someone who has had violence done to them i can say without a doubt you can feel the difference between violence and words silence.
best thing to do is grab a seat  some snacks   beverages and watch the entertaining woke knife fight. always bet on the mob
hellz yea lady way to go your kicking ass with your channel!!
all i can say to this is  called it.
i think you look good.  there is no reason not to show off what you worked for.  you have a great body  there s no reason you should have to hide it under a bag.
thank you
love your videos keep it up. bought hogwarts. today pre-ordered not really a big harry potter  fan but saw your video on the woke crowd. i just had to spend 90. dollars and say let s stick it too them. i be playing it on the 10th
congrats on 100k subs  love the videos
melonie  i have never before heard of mark hamill catering to the woke. indeed  the man tried to subtly warn the fans of just how bad the disney sw flicks were going to be.
congratulations on the plaque!
mark hamil is slowly turning to the dark side. lol
congrats on the 100k recognition!
the thing is with the whole not liking someone or hating someone because they re woke  that s their thing  that s what they do  that s how they think.just don t
ya know i thought you meant to say dysmorphia  but then i checked google and i realize you where right and i was wrong.
mark will move to an island to live out the rest of his life in isolation.
anyone else see the irony of the fact of that person saying  i m more of a woman than j. k. rowling ever will be.  is only an insult if the person who wrote it is admitting that he is not a woman
i like what u say bout what s going makes me glad someone knows what s going on other than me and my grandma
lol.  congratulations on 100k  melonie.
to be honest melony i didnt even notice what you were wearing till you said somthing xd cool abs tho. thats why im willing to work and be kind to these people but as soon as they get unreasonibly hostile or just  dont get it  i dont bother trying
sure he should have never bent the knee but it s crazy you can t have your own opinion anymore. i swear twitter is its own universe.
i had to let mark go...now its bitting his arse.
i m gonna create a hp character in the image of luke skywalker  hamill back in the 70 s 80 s  when hl comes out.
don t pander to the woke mob.  words to live by.
i guess he knows what it s like with the shoe on the other foot now.
actors are rarely as interesting as the characters they play... just my opinion  i enjoy their work and talent- they have little impact on my day to day life.
never apologize to woke people
contact me for your reward
they re in their own hell. they ll destroy with each other.
congrats on 100k!
i didn t even know about rowling and the trans community against her. i thought people rejected her for her beliefs on the jewish people and doubling down on those beliefs. i honestly feel ppl should just keep everything to themselves nowadays
congrats on the play button!
sub count on a mission! love to see it
congrats on the 100k milestone
great start for your channel.
congratulations  and by the way  gray looks really good on you
can you imagine being 70 years old and being scared of snot-nosed maniacs on a trash app
at this point  i really hope for that alleged giant solar flare to explode and take us to the middle ages again...this world needs a reboot
thats why you are the best! you rock!!
this is art!
respect from those with an agenda is a bygone idea. they don t believe they have to respect anyone they disagree with on anything. if a transgender agenda driven person  not all transgender people are agenda driven  likes coke more than pepsi  and if you are straight or white or whatever  and like pepsi more than coke  you re anti-trans and racist for having a different opinion on soda. this is just getting crazy.
totally agree
jk is a badass shes a very smart n great woman!
use the force melonie! also your ponytail makes u look like kitty pryde from x-men evolution.
yeah i agree melonie  you re amazing
congratulations on 112k subscribers. yes the number keeps going up. and remember to drink water.  ok one day i ll stop reminding you. hahaha
i was gay but melonie and her tatts made me straight praise the lord
the only validation i need is from god . amen
he turned to the dark side and it corrupted and consumed him
contact me for your reward
congratulations on over 100 000 subscribers.
2 39 to be honest  i kinda agree with it  because jk rowling has huge balls. i rarely agree with her point of view but i respect how she treats her brand and creations.
congrats on your subscribed numbers!
reality will always reign over fantasy  no matter how many titles they put on it.
congratulations on 100k !
congratulations  love that plaque
while i appreciate his work in star wars  he s just another woke hollywood celeb and deserves everything that s happening to him.
i always bend the knee    to tie my damn shoes.
luvya mel !!!  rock on and god bless...
evil always cannibalizes  itself.
melanie is kind of woke...she insulted rings of power but is silent on vikings valhalla season 2
he mocked el rushbo when he passed on. he earned this.
trans-trenders . love it!
mark hamill is a sad case. he used to be super cool with fans  and seemingly a really nice guy...before the dark times...before the woke.
uh oh the irony is bitter sweet on this one  d
i m pretty sure they actually meant they re more of a man than j.k. rowling will ever be.
the woke mob is unforgiving.  i have relatives who won t talk to me because of my voting habits. they will never grow up.
congrats on the 100k.
imagine how much we could get done if the population didn t argue and get offended over stuff which doesn t need any attention.the next gen is screwed!
congratulations! don t you already have a plaque because of your old channel
i have no idea what vikings valhalla even is  so i m woke because i haven t watched it  that makes zero sense dude lol!
yup  i have two now
@meloniemacgoboom  that s quite an achievement.
make 1984 fiction again!
rippa said it best. let them fight.
it is not a human right to force people to participate in one s delusions about one s self.
aw ok i had an apartment here already and never hung out with my old friends who  live  a mile away. and now its 2023 at the same apartment again and with a car to find a job  apartment paid for by parents. but where are these friends  and we lived together before the apartment. i have the car also now  and my friends are dead...
yeah  you think he would be old-school because he is really old but i guess that s not the case he s just another one on the list of weirdos
there s a reason for the sign at the zoo that says   don t feed the animals.
it s a spiritual battle always has been  no such thing as dysphoria
mark hamill gets his just desserts
...they re pushing the boundaries...
now more than ever men and women need to have each other s backs.
if you slow this down to .25  it sounds way more accurate. pot call kettle black
you are of god and have such ample agency. embody truth  wholeheartedly.   very refreshing to be a witness to your sense of authority.  that blessing is awe-inspiring. in you and through the power of the word   it is shown...... the realities you unearth. you are beloved  as you know all too well  glory be you.
10 50 absolutely spot on.
unrelated but could you please review hbo s the last of us weekly  loved what you had to say  guesting with critical drinker
i m not gonna complain about the gym outfit lol
i disagree with the truth part in a way. truth can have some subjectivity to it  facts do not.  their truth  is definitely subjective  and for some strange reason they think  their truth  trumps objective facts. you can believe whatever you want  but that belief can be completely different than what actually is or isn t.
blood in the water. the smart predator always goes for the weakest animal in the herd  the one least likely to fight back or injure it.
garts on 100k melonie  d
hard to defend mh. he helped grow the beast. maybe he will grow from it.
well deserved silver plate melonie
so true!
she already said the show is good not great what content would she get
now we know why rian  for brains  johnson and kkkathleen kennedy wrote luke skywalker as such in tlj  because they took real life inspiration from mark hamil himself.
your eyes are enchanting.
lol  melonie is down bad for aquaman xd
to appease the trans agenda  the main character of tomb raider is now larry croft after transitioning.   he  wears a leisure suit.
you rock  stay frosty
this is why i consider myself a conservative. i d rather throw my support behind you and matt walsh then the woke left cause they will turn on you in a second
i want to know your skin care routine. it must be phenomenal. the only thing that gives you away is your hands.
i always say   the internet is not your friend
so are we glossing over the fact that mark ended his tweet with the word  period  in all capital letters   one of the biological factors that some might argue separates india from j.k. rowling  possibly not working in india s favor pretty clever.  but of course it s twitter so people smart enough to catch it will be few and far between...
well its not the first time the woke mob turned against hamill. remember when he brought up how in the star wars sequel movies how there was no reunion between the og actors
that moron s tweet is like me  a broke  us born citizen  saying something like   i m more king charles iii  than king charles iii is.
free speech is crucial to who we are as individuals. no matter our beliefs opinions we should be capable to agree to disagree without it becoming this petty and childish.
11 12  the only validation i need is from god a. men.
i d be willing to hear jk rowling out if she retracted some of the woke pandering from years past. my problem with rowling  trump  and other celebrities  is they were friends with the left for a really long time and only recently spoke out because of cancel culture. i would respect celebs more if they went further than trans bathrooms because that s an easy thing to criticize.
how many more iconic ppl are we going to ostracized
never trust a wokie   . or a sith. they re very similar. hogwarts legacy goty
didn t use the force this timecongrats on 100k mel
never give in never surrender never bend a knee to the woke freaks
i consider myself somewhat left leaning  but when i think about woke movies and tv shows  most people view that as an afterthought. i feel like the ones on twitter complaining about things need to be more woke are just the loudest ones. take the velma show. people from both sides saw that and viewed it as shit. most ppl i talk to that are considered to be on the left know when something is purposely made to be extremely woke putting check boxes first and story and characters last. i wish actual woke media gets pushed more. most ppl on both sides are tired of it. its due to the loudest leftist on twitter and movie and show companies trying to make a check of them. theres alot of shows that are woke and still have great characters and story due to it being made by actual competent ppl. but these type of shows and movies never make as much money and gets pushed down since studios are judt checking boxes to get ppl into theaters  and the movies suck ass because of it. woke shit is dying. most people  that dont live on twitter want good shit to watch. not abunch of rich as fuck ppl hammering some shit down our throats.
the person whom any cult will turn on the fast is one of their own.
don t let people s criticism of your friends get you down. there is nothing wrong with being friends or admiring people with different ideologies  but you cannot maintain a friendship or respect anyone who is a hypocrite. it is one thing for a person to be wrong  but it is another for them to know that they are wrong and continue to portray themselves as right or righteous. jesus befriended sinners and the dregs of his society  but showed nothing but contempt for the fakes and frauds that pretended to be holy while living against god s commands.
i don t think  stand up against it  is the correct response.  that india is obviously insecure  hence his her frogselfs reaction.  that person needs therapy and a heavy dose of self awareness.
better hated than subjugated.
my stance on this whole thing is very simple  hatred is wrong. whether you re a bigot  or a self-righteous jerk  you don t hate people  and you don t act on hatred either. there are ways to stand-up for your beliefs without condemning others.
the  woke  just sounds like that what they are all doing is just crying together. i just bought hagwards legacy.. and gonna buy one for my daughter too. maybe i ll buy one more for a random friend. i want to see them cry more.
wokeness is a secular cult. look at any cult s behavior  they pretend to care about their fellow cultists and treat them like they are loved and accepted until one of their brethren steps out of line of their prescribed belief system and all of a sudden you are marked for death by the other zealots
first of all...congratulations  meloni for the yt button!and second...the more ppl they cancel  the more the coherency has allies...plus  that guy saying he is more woman that a real woman is just...m y s o g i n i s t.keep judging the wrongspeak  lefties.... thats just more ammo to us.
that face got her 100k. reddit.
all of us have our perspective and that is clouded by our meager mortality. god knows the pure truth. god knows all the perspectives.
gl on the million plaque you got this
mark turned into a clown himself  i loved the guy but he went woke and i m done
i personally refuse to associate or even like any  beings  of the woke variety. i and those in the order have a thing called standards and we respect ourselves. we recognize them as the threat to civilization that they are  and so liking any one of them is a blasphemy against all that is human and holy. do not sully the greatness of humanity by admiring it s weak links. they exist as a test.. and remember that true tests never end
god bless you!
melonie  we re not called to ignore the wicked  but we are called to set ourselves apart. yes  momoa is a good looking  fun guy. he s also endorsing spiritual corruption. pray for him  if you get the opportunity  witness to him  but do not follow him  unless you risk being lead astray.
jason momoa is against single use plastics. admirable
there s a pattern surrounding j.k. s tweet.we say that s not the definition  so they change the dictionary.that s not how it was in the game  so they change the game.that s not how the comic goes  so they change the comic.whatever the source they stray from  they just change the source.eliza kept hearing that her video is in public domain  so she removed it.how does rowling and the rest fit here  well  we say you re not a woman and your white existence was male. you re experience here is different  so just changing your mind doesn t make you a woman. they then said  fair game  we ll get them before they can t even read  let alone say big syllable words.so when she says citation needed  they see it as a slap. they get off on fooling people when they pass  but get pissed when they don t pass. the experiment is to see if things would be different if caught up at an early age. alter the source.
it s definitely satanic and extremely divisive. it s crazy how people can be so easily swayed by what others say online that they don t even know  i always come back to this  those that mind don t matter  those that matter don t mind.
gratz on 100k trophy
mark is a legend  even if he is a leftie. i hope this serves as a wake up call for him.
lol show all the ab you want you actually go to the gym it makes sense you wear gym clothes you are still classy and i totally agree with this video
100 000  maybe one day i will get the million one haha! thank you  d
jason momoa s acting is plastic.
hamill is putting himself as victim as he always does  throwing anyone under the proverbial bus to stay safe... this time  it was jk rowling   i don t like her  buhuhuh it s all he does. and he s just laying on the bed that he made... i don t know why this guy became so adored in the 2000s  he was always a sub-par actor with two famous gigs. that s it. a recurrent joke about him in the 90s was that he s a has-been living in the glorious days of the past... what i did discovered nowadays is how much of a filthy human being he is. since he got triggered with a kid using stormtrooper costume.  durh it was from trump s family  jfc grow up...
maybe old mark just needs to increase his daily dosage of soy and vegan sausages. get that testosterone back down to a nice  safe  girly level.
don t pander to anyone  be your best self.
hey mel   idk what your secret is  but you continue to get more beautiful each time you upload . keep up the great work   your videos are amazing  and praise our father in heaven   the living god   jesus christ.
like saturn  the revolution devours its children. jacques mallet du pan
i will remember mark hamill for his roles as the joker and luke skywalker pre last jedi but not as this liberal lunatic that he has been for years now.
should their dysphoria be accepted as reality   -- the problem is that they re appealing to the same rationales as homosexuals have been appealing to for decades now  for acceptance and promotion of their desires and behaviors  which were also once  charitably!  diagnosed as only psychological disorders instead of being  at least sometimes  lifestyle choices  much less as being moral problems. to classify transsexual behaviors insane  would logically undermine homosexual behaviors by the same degree back to being a medical problem  something to be treated and if possible cured  not accepted as normalized and equivalently proper to other sexual behaviors.
congratulations mmgb
woke ideologi is not a religion. saying so  means you don t know what entails a religion. they might share some of the same ways of behavior. like being a brainwashed religious person  like you. and i don t think it s satanic. if i remember correctly  satanist believe you aren t allowed to force you view on others. it s pretty much about minding your own business
that is a trope in entertainment  that is also common in advertising  everything is wonderful  it is awesome  it is heavenly  except that one thing.  there are people who hate j.k. rowling  and they are picking something to alienate her from the public.  j.k. rowling is awesome and amazing  and she is correct  in that women s lavatories are private spaces for people with only girl-parts.  in addition  j.k. rowling is an artist  and she is a creator.  the woke mob is claiming that artists shall obey them  and this is the tyranny of the stupid.  the woke-ism is bizarre  and they are anarchists  they cannot be pleased  because it is like pleasing the world  and you will fail and fall every time.  you are not a victim  if you choose to isolate yourself with bizarre attitude problems  or being wildly eccentric  or commanding other people to obey you  or demanding to be validated  because that is being anti-social  it is a personal duty to get happy for other people  nobody else can be happy for you.  it is like this  the prisoner s dilemma is model of cooperation and non-cooperation events  where the world becomes a checkerboard pattern of black squares  non-cooperate  and red squares  cooperate   and this divides society based upon our behavior with each other  its behavior has been observed in nature  and it isn t racist  this is normal and expected  because the people involved choose their place by how they interact with each other.  i expect the internet and big tech to create spaces like this  because the witches are rebels who demand control  and they lie about anything  and they leave us chasing ghosts for all the dishonesty   they have to isolate themselves  for being unforgiving.  that is the only way out of the prisoner s dilemma in the cycle of abuse of non-cooperate in tit-for-tat behavior  that is you eventually have to forgive to leave the cycle of abuse  this is the only strategy that scores higher than tit-for-tat  of once non-cooperate happens  we are non-cooperating all of the time  because the penalties for cooperating with trouble are too high  forgiveness is a hidden factor .
back before jerry springer woke up the world about gender dysphoria  the harry benjamin society had very strict rules....you had to be able to pass completely   you had to live in the world for at least a year  and there was this common knowledge that true gender dysphoria was really really rare.  you wouldn t be allowed  by reputable doctors and shrinks  to have surgeries if you were 6 3  bench pressing 300lbs.  with that in mind i have to say i think it is bullshit that trans people can compete in women s sports....for god s sake  admit to yourself that the xy has given you better upper body strength  more oxygen in the blood  a bigger heart  etc....chicks with d  cks should bow out  lol....and already in idaho letting boys wear dresses and use girl s bathrooms has lead to men photographing young girls.  common sense peoples....
a prominent feminist in the movement being made the villain   for originally taking a honor and saying how proud she was as a woman for her success  and that s  problematic now again for stating the obvious.we are truly living in a twilight zone episode guys and gals
jesus said to love the sinner but hate the sin.
i feel so sorry for all the conservatives in media and hollywood that feel they are forced to play ball with the leftist ideology to keep their jobs  and to find new opportunities. i have great respect for those that chose to be better  to say enough is enough  and was cast out as a result. mark was always someone who was too damn genuine to be a soulless liberal. a democrat  fine. but not a far leftist. whenever i see his tweets i think... poor man. he s too damn old and not a politician to be bowing down to the far left loons. unfortunately everyone who bows continues to enable these people and give them power. it s extremely frustrating to see this huge fraction of human beings gain such power. even if they were 50 million strong across the earth  there are over 6 billion human beings alive. why in the world are we bowing down to these wack jobs i will never understand until i look to the bible  in the end times  up is down. right is wrong.
it s a cult  honestly.
i don t know anyone who suffers from gender dysphoria.and this is a decades-long problem  where otherwise would-be opponents of  woke  culture turn on their allies. everybody knows someone who suffers from gender dysphoria ... 40 years ago it would have been   everyone knows someone who suffers from homosexuality .and the second you go on the rhetorical offensive against an insanity which afflicts the friends and relatives of your alleged  allies ... those allies will turn on you out of a misplaced since of loyalty and compassion.so if in 2000 i say   homosexuality is a mental illness ... i lose all allies.just as jk rowling loses allies 20 years later.this insanity will continue so long as we are forbidden from calling this mental illness a mental illness  and treating its victims as people with a mental problem  rather than just another way of being  normal .but now  because they ll throw the terrible  phobe  at you  no no no you have to pretend the emperor s clothes are really cool. even alleged conservatives will turn on you if you point out that a  according to  the science   all forms of aberrant sexual appetites are abnormal  or b  that as western society has become weaker and farther from its cultural principles and values  as western society has had to struggle less and less just to survive  we ve seen epidemic proportions of aberrant behavior and appetites. the rise of homosexuality  bestiality  pedophilia and trans-whatever is not in isolation from the decay of western civilization. as rome began its decline  they went from julius caesar criticizing the gauls for their alleged homosexuality  to caligula sleeping with a horse... in only 80 years or so. if you compress for the relative lives of rome vs the us  that equates to the 10-15 years we ve seen things get really bad in the us.the difference is  rome was just decaying  a victim of its own prosperity. we re suffering from the same prosperity curse  but with the added burden of an active and committed  century long assault by socialist slavers  marxists and those who won t admit they re marxists   with the intent of destroying western civilization so they can bring about their socialist hell utopia.they re using our own values of tolerance and individual liberty  which require a certain amount of maturity and self-discipline  against us  while being totally intolerant of others.
you had me till you talked about the most ironic thing you could talk about as a religious person... saying one religion is false compared to another. that made me giggle. then talked about the spitirtual stuff like humans can t just be bad. nope! need a reason for that and it s spiritualy bad stuff. instead of some people are just bad.
i was listening on the way home  when i got home and switched to wi-fi. instantly i went from 144p to 1040p60fps. now for my question. do you have a black eye
congratulations my sister
i think he should of told them to f    off and left it there
wrongthink really is the proper word.
twitter must disappear from the internet  it brings more harm than good
give it time  they eat their own at any given chance.
this broad said people can t handle arguments but blocks me because she didn t like my argument
let him fight it out  eventually the woke mob will implode on themselves and i m sitting here with popcorn waiting for the show
congrats on 100k
gay  gay  gay  gay  gay  gay  gay  gay  gay    mark hamill
congratz!
they can t argue with dna.
melonie.replace the word truth in the statement truth to power with the actual word they mean.will.then study up and find they re basically committing intellectual plagiarism as they don t know how to think of their own accord without attaching their ego.it becomes more honest and clear when you put back the original word they are obfuscating over.
i am sooooo sick of wokeness. i m from the uk   even here the tv media have gone full woke   if you say one thing that even slightly differs from their agenda you get cancelled. as for social media  i got labeled a nazi on twitter yesterday just for discussing hogwarts legacy ffs
anyone who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities   voltaire - 1765.  don t learn from history.  rinse and  repeat  over and over  fear the worst is yet to come.
did you see chrissie mayr s  frosk  on friday night tights with frosk s head on your body  funny stuff.
commenting to feed the algorithm
the mob is strong in this one...
be woke become a joke
love the videos mac  but come on girl!! i would have loved a heads-up about the new channel  i thought you retired years ago!
trans trender  nailed it.
sad to say  mark hamill has always been a follower.
great
i ve been giving heads up on my old channel and on all my social media over the past 11 months so i dunno what else i could have done  i never stopped content creation at allglad you eventually found it tho
@meloniemacgoboom  happy to be back into the fold m - here s to a new era
mark is just reaping what he sowed. pander to and include yourself in with a band of idiots that have no purpose in life other than to be offended by something and eventually they ll turn on you.
biological males make better women than actual women  is what they are trying to say  not comprehending that they are the supposed  patriarchy  that they so despise.
you should actively try to piss off the woke mobs
i don t know if  absurd  is strong enough language. i thinking more like  lunacy  or psychosis
honestly  this got blown way out of proportion. here is the proper response mark hamill should have said biological male person   i m more of a woman than jk rowling mark hamill  last time i checked  jk rowling has an xx chromosome  you  sir  have an xy chromosome. therefore  no  you re not more woman than jk rowling  because her gender identity is literally written into her dna. argue with science  not me. but did he do that  no. he decided to roll with the rights issue  when the actual comment had nothing to do with rights  it had to do with scientific fact.
how do you woke live going mark.
the rights of one shall not infringe upon another s
do you know anything about this liberty elementary school incident. this teachers wife died  and all of a sudden he starts going to school wearing his wives clothes. and he insists he be identify him as a woman         there was a public hearing about this. and there is video from this.   here is the news clip about  the cat lady   https   youtu.be 43dbcwdytsghere is  the cat ladys  full speech https   youtu.be 9nw_t2xhaf0and here s a clip of someone else speaking at the same event telling the story of a fellow dressing like a woman. and pretending to be a coach for one of the girl sports teams. and the guy just stands in the locker room and watches them change. https   youtu.be lz746mei_fs  i just thought i d chare this with you.
after all the trash takes hamill has vocalized so loudly...i love his work but he s made his own bed. i wont be goin to bat for him.
ehh  i don t have any sympathy for marky h. he s already proven to be a part of what s going after him right now
can you get work with a functional brain in the entertainment industry today  i mean  they don t even have functional writers any more. if they try to be normal  the thought police will go after them. because abnormality is the new normal for them.
its gonna be a woke 1984 lmao
i use to like jason until i saw the video of him groping a 10-11 year old girl to the point she jerked his hand away and said stop
yay melonie !
they always eat their own. always.
no... i don t sympathize for the sick that doesn t want to get better  i can understand their condition but not sympathize  it s their choice so i let it rot as far as i can from me
there is no placating the mob. i ve no idea why people try
if everyone s truth is truth  what s special about truth  and what s special about speaking truth to power
jk rowling has a virginia right  isn t that a top trump  lol
karma!
laughs in told ya so . the woke will always eat their own.
congrats on plaque
reasons dictates that two truths cannot occupy the same space. either one is a lie or both are lies.
they always eat their own.
wait  momoa is woke
i m more of a woman than you ll ever be  melonie. deal with it!
j.k.rowling is becoming a  slytherin.  xd crazy wakes us all up  i suppose. it is not evil to deny men the right to be women etc.
define  woke
what did j.k rowling even do that is so bad  not asking for a argument sake  just genuinely curious what was wrong with her opinion from the left sided standpoint.
they eat their own
woke mob realy dont wanna start with the star wars community
see me as a real women  also i m better than a real women.
ok  captain optimistic
hey mac did you gots more tattoos on your left arm
look at tribes in  technologically behind country s they are a tribe because more people means less work for everyone and survival for most but when they have gone through all resources or been defeated and forced to leave their homes they are no longer secure and safe become sad and eventually desperate and will turn on each other that s why we need to ignore them and let them darwin themselves
don t swim with the sharks. they re known to eat their own  so what will they do to you
i love mark hamill as a actor va but holy crap his take on politics are garbage
all i saw was correct think
look at you showing all that shoulder for shame jezebel ......
i m sorry  but when did hamill pander to the mob  everything i hear about him is him bashing the new star wars films.
oh  no. the woke crowd will be burning their copies of  corvette summer .
transtrender  nice way to distinguish opportunists from people who are actually trans.
2 49 i think there s something to be said for these  trans  folk. they wanna say they re  real women  but then turn around and say they re better than a real woman  the fuck  their ideology caves in on itself the minute you think about it. they wanna stop being compared to women  they should stop comparing themselves to women.genuinely trans people like blaire white  buck angel or even marcus  channel name is  the offensive tranny  lmao  will openly and freely acknowledge their biological sex.its so weird to me that people like this on the left wanna say we re transphobic but they are the ones pretending like there s something wrong with being a  trans woman  vs a  real woman   which appears very transphobic  right all in all i hope this is a social phase that ends soon. there is a state trying to ban gender affirming healthcare for people under 26. i believe this is because we ve seen enough minors get butchered and mutilated by these surgeons and the kid ends up realizing one day  woah  im not trans and i had my breasts cut off for no reason.  this rapidly growing   of detransitioners will prompt action to ban it. i think it should def be banned for anyone under 18  and while the prefrontal cortex  brains center of critical thinking and reasoning  does not finish developing until 26  i cannot say that i agree with that proposed law.
melonie is the best
ha ha. that s what you get for bowing and bending for these weirdos. because you re gonna have to crawl on your back forever and the moment you stand up they re gonna come after you.
wth! weren t all these wokies meant to leave twitter when elon took over the company  why they all still there
love you
there a cult
lol  derp.
one   day when your bored  put your ego aside and research bubbles    in space. it will change your life
yes  i have friends who are transgender for me  anymore  that s a red flag. that s a signal to shut my mouth and stop  speaking truth to power  as i see it  or face persecution and ostracism from my own  side   because i m not a friend  and loyalty to a mentally ill friend comes before loyalty to the truth... even the truth of the bible.simple proof of concept  do you use your friends   preferred pronouns  around them  do you refer to them by and treat them as the sex they ve chosen to pose as  or do you stick to your principles in spite of it hurting their feelings and maybe ending the relationship   because if you stick to your principles  you re going to constantly hurt their feelings  or they re going to end the relationship for you. so which is it i have this same issue with other pseudo-conservatives who insist on being buddy-buddy with blair white  calling him  she   but who have no problem at all mocking the poor guy in the convenience store ranting   it s ma am! . simply because one can pull off the illusion better than the other  oh  and makes the right pseudo-conservative noises. metaphorically  it s like befriending a charismatic grifter who s really skilled at gulling people  yet mocking a clumsy pickpocket.yes  i have sympathy for people suffering from gender dysphoria or other sex-related mental illnesses... but i only express it if they admit to themselves that there s something wrong with them  and act accordingly. the same way i would an alcoholic or drug addict.
took you long enough to get the silver play  try harder next time
the woke deserve each other.
yeah but melonie is more of a woman then india whilloughby will ever be.
yes! finally a woman making noice that s not pro-leftist bullshit. not very common on youtube. much welcome. with a good micropjone  important.
i m so tired of this nonsensical  debate ... woke trans people like that ask for understanding from everyone but have none to give themselves. i can t.
i wonder how can a arrogant opinion be the truth. only facts are fully true
you are a very beautiful girl.
as a non-woke christian  what pronouns do you use for your transgender friends
people who trans just to be held up by the vocal minority  just makes me sad for the current state of humanity...
nice sleeve
god says it s an abomination and that s the mindset i m keeping. i ve seen enough of them to understand why god said that.

xy   xx
at first i thought  mark hamill likrd a tweet from jkr   cool.  then i remembered he s a diehard anti-trump democrat. the dark side of the force is strong with this one.
hamill damil
people dollface
good morning i hate the antichristthis ought to confuse some leftists going through these comments
inte        nayaru. marka limenka h nge ha e voi para sa    min  inkathalo.
you need to do some serious research.
this whole trans movement has nothing to do with gender dysphor1a anymore.
do you get much backlash talking about woke mob or god
validation from god ...  lmfao ... wokeness and religion very much the same  beleaf in ideals
seek god and his sweet amazing grace. jesus is the way to truth to abundant life. read the kjv  and pray for wisdom.
this isn t your business! get a real job
you reap what you sow.  mark hamill was all too happy to jump down people s throat who liked trump or elon musk or anything like that.  without star wars he wouldn t even be relevant and no one would care about him.  what else does he got...the guyver   who remembers that mess of a movie
melanie  for crying out loud  stop continually apologizing in this video for your view on the transgender issue or topic.
says woke people are brainwashed  later says that  woke ideology  is  satanic lmao. the irony
first
we should see the sin as an abomination  but we are to hate the sin and love the sinner regardless
@meloniemacgoboom  your desire to be kind does you justice but it s this attitude that has allowed it to become a trend. we ve been trying to  live and let live   look where the world is going. i don t hate them but i wont go out of my way in the slightest to protect their feelings. it should be frowned upon or at very least  kept in the closet away from children.
this isn t my desire  this is biblical. trust me  i would love to hate my enemies lol. i just obey god instead of my flesh. so if you have a problem with this  take it up with god not me.
@meloniemacgoboom  i think there s a bit more to it than that  abomination is a very strong word. that said we all have our own interpretation of what exactly it is that the bible says. no problems here  just discussing the topic and sharing my view on things.
@meloniemacgoboom  i would be interested to know if you have friends that are murderers etc as well. you d have to  respect  them too if you are going to stay consistent.
every day lol
@meloniemacgoboom   sorry about that. hope you still have the strength to do more of your good content
i didn t apologize for anything
@meloniemacgoboom  i meant the literal definition of apologize in the sense of over explaining your position i.e. you aren t being mean by the things or stance you take on transgender issues. you make sure over and over again that people understand that. i suppose that that cautionary note that you re giving is warranted on social media here  just thought that you were over explaining your position so as to not hurt anybody s feelings. that s what i meant by apologize.
i didn t over explain anything. i m a christian  part of my values are to hate the sin but love the sinner  and i will not apologize to you for expressing that in my videos. i never desire to come across as hating people  that would be against god s will.
