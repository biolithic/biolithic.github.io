this happened to a childhood friend of my college roommate about 10 years ago. the friend traveled to ireland  met a charming irishman  fell in love. after a while they married and came back to the us and started a family.  after 2 kids  he decided he wanted to be a woman.  left her and the kids to  live his truth . she s still devastated  and embarrassed  and blames herself. she s not remarried because she s afraid it ll happen again. this selfish weirdo broke her. it s disgusting.
people saying the break up broke him  nah  she left him because of this. i guarantee there were signs of this before she finally left  the first time he painted his nails she probably questioned him. it wasn t the break up that did it  him doing it caused the break up. something caused him to start this before she ever thought about leaving him.chris broke her and left her first  not the other way around. chris tricked her. she thought she found a man to have a family with. she went through pregnancy for them and gave birth for them. guaranteed she gave him multiple chances and prayed for him to not do this. she didn t leave him  she saved herself and her child because the chris she thought she married  already left her.
imagine selling out your family  child  and self worth.
this social engineering is terrifying. the implications of adding ai to that engineering will be an exponential force multiplier. scary times but i m glad we have people like melonie on our side.
you ve read my thoughts exactly. how does something like this happen to a grown adult that had everything going for them in general i think there are some perverse incentives  pun intended  going on here. especially with how much that community self-affirms and shields themselves from outside criticism. who wouldn t want to be in that ingroup    consciously or subconsciously
the mom needs to get the hell away from him. he can make his choices but leave the kid alone!
she is really brave to say these thing at risk or cancelation. reality matters though..
matt walsh made a great point- his poor wife isn t even allowed to publicly grieve cause she ll risk being called a  transphobe .
lots of good points made in the video. respect to you for staying sane  double respect because you are female.
wow a woman who dares to tell the truth. i hope you don t get banned on youtube love you
yeah  this is crazy. kids can t even watch youtube videos without this stuff being pushed in front of them. the children need to be protected at all costs. god bless you for speaking out against these mel. jesus loves you sister.
i feel bad for the wife and child
the second i heard about this i instantly thought he was being paid to do this in front of 100  million children  absolutely sickening. don t let this cult groom your kids people!
great job bringing awareness to this issue  mel.
i m only speaking for myself here. in 2011  i was married and working on building a life but i was surrounded by people that constantly encouraged me to push boundaries. you can t push boundaries and settle down at the same time. anyhow  i ended up getting sucked into second life and  subsequently  further surrounded by those who encouraged pushing boundaries. deeper and deeper in to the extremes of things. started roaming around on a female avatar  and it seemed to give me a certain  power  i didn t have previously. suddenly  i was able to make bill payments without worrying about it  that is thanks to this female version of me. i lost myself. i really started to think i was meant to be a woman just because i was getting a lot more money. i even considered going under-the-knife to  fix  things. fast forward from 2011 to 2019. getting an mri to my brain discovered i was missing a portion of my frontal lobe along with damage to my temporal lobe  all stemming from a childhood accident. i ve had to come to terms with the fact that  most of my life  i ve misinterpreted a great deal of things. that is to say  i ve been wrong about a lot  even my perceived sexuality. these days  knowing about the damage  i m really glad i never pushed the boundaries across the point of no return. i m a guy  born and raised this way  it s my lot in life  and i m okay with that now.
the guy single handily destroyed his family   this poor little boy is having his whole family destroyed because of one s actions
i m 46 this year and my hope for a wife and kids dwindles every day
my son pointed this out to me. he watches mr beast and knew this before i did. he even pointed out all the awkward moments in videos after the buddy  came out .
chris didn t want to marry his wife  he wanted to be his wife. she is the victim here  as others have said. hopefully  his son won t be as well. the promotion of the ideology that chris mentioned in his tweet needs to be stopped. brittany speaks of it in her videos as well. thank you for your bravery  melonie. stay safe.
that s what i m saying!! he was  paid  to transition and  paid  to do so under mr. beast to put him in such a tough spot leaving him almost no choice but to  support  or he ll be outed as a  transphobe  and such. just to prove a point is my belief why chris did this
very confusing story  irishman was actually a women  did he know that  when they started dating
@speed kills  the friend is the woman who fell in love with an irishman. the irishman later became trans.
@corich cortex  ah  ok  i see...
the dude posted a pic of his kid  boy  wearing heels too.... wife needs to call dcf and have custody rights  if he has any  removed.
he would have klld himself anyway so it s better than being ded lol
@aspire wot  they don t care about that lol
@aspire wot  sorry.. what  he would ve killed himself are you seriously trying to justify this by blurting trans nonsense about how every person confused about their gender takes suicide if their narcissistic  fetish-obsessed feelings aren t validated frankly  it s better to die an honorable person than to lose any and all honor you once had only to live a life of deceit and lies.
@the northerner  i m not justifying anything i m just stating according to data and what psychiatrist recommend . and it has been proven that transition can help their mental health   decrease all of these negative thoughts . thanks why we support them   because they re suffering while on the other hand christians or other right wing people don t understand this basic idea lol
@aspire wot   right wing  people accept reality.
i do  i imagine a briefcase holding 20 mil in gold.then i imagine pour gasoline and lighter just to say  no  in the most proportionate way possible.
i am glad melonie is here
who wouldn t want to be in that ingroup  anyone with a healthy mental state.  people who fear judgement and criticism arent living right  its as simple as that.
what do you mean perverse  !!! no one should live for what society deems as  normal.  at the end of the day us trans people don t live for you  we transition and live for ourselves!
who said he was gonna try and brainwash his kid
his snap chat shows him buying tiny heals for his son
@when life gives you lemons  any links to a source
she needs sole custody. sadly it probably won t happy because chris is filthy rich  and also because most judges won t realize the damage going on.
@haunbeu ii  and btw u blind or somthin 9 00 go to this timestamp
cancellation is only a thing if you re a lefty and get eaten by your own. melanie isn t at risk of cancellation  which really isn t much of a thing anymore anyway since the world is getting so fed up with all the bull shit  since she doesn t cater to the kind of weirdos who would be offended by her stance  and like she noted  importantly  she doesn t currently use agencies managers who would potentially cave to a twitter mob . the time for bravery is now - anyone who doesn t call all this crap out despite wanting to for fear of cancellation is just part of the problem.
if your using youtube for monetary gain and they flag you  yeah canceled. i agree with you  enough is enough. i have young kids and i feel like i have to shield them from just about everything because this stuff is everywhere. they are too young for the discussion but old enough to be persuaded. ppl gotta take up the armor of god..
when god is your ally  who may stand against you
yeah i didn t even think of that.
the narcissim.
the singer from against me did the same crap in 2012and even at that point other bands and fans couldn t say anything
i hope she gets full custody of her son. chris tyson should not be around kids. and should not be on the mrbeast channel also.
i haven t been following the story when chris transition did he leave his wife or is this a elliot page where i believe there still married
that must be really tough for the wife knowing the man she was in love now is a trans.
i hope she goes after every dime possible  through alimony
@big robot news today  why
she can grieve lol it s fine
publicly grieve
@crabfren  that s fucked up just bc he wanted to be who he wants to be wow
@ekko  juvenile jibberish
@jello snake  tf does that mean
@ekko  because it s not safe when he gets his dingdong cut off and gets his first yeast infection.
@ekko  truth is rarely painless
@crabfren  what truth please explain u guys say nothing
@ekko  family courts rarely side with the paternal party  and perversion shouldn t be uplifted. it should be stamped out like the fire it is.
@ekko  he s into loli  why not
@chaochromemessor  what
@ekko  did you not read his post about  cranking it  to lolis  or do you just like to pretend you re always right
@chaochromemessor  not forgetting the pics he posts on social media depicting his toddler son wearing adult high heeled shoes.
@fauxshowyo  so what does that have to do with him being trans my guy
exactly. matt was bang on the money. if he d cheated  with a woman  that is  she could have taken him to the cleaners and rightly so and everyone would have rooted for her. but in this case  society will expect her to be  supportive  and she doesn t even get to be angry in a socially acceptable way.
@ariel lezcano  he only took hrt for now this is just how identify
i hope she drained him financially  doing this is sick and selfish.
@chaochromemessor  are you  can t even say it wow  or you re gonna pretend like he didn t say it as a joke i mean common sense would say based on his eilier homor was dark
@khan  what can t you say  if you are afraid of the censors from youtube  i m not  so go ahead. if you are implying i m a  transphobe  you are wrong  i m allowed to hate a bad apple  when the rest of the bunch does too.
@chaochromemessor  i tryed saying retarte by youtube won t let me
ex-wife she hasn t been a part of his life for over a year now   and i don t know why they divorced
@trauma llama  someone using their head
yup  chris s ex wife is probably suffering in silence.hopefully she s ok.
what if he is being paid to act that way to influence the large audience of viewers they have  and maybe she knows he is doing it for money  or maybe not.
@ekko  the dude s mentally unstable.
@edward bernard  any proof
@ekko what about her  she wanted to marry a man  not a trans woman. i say the hell with him it. the wife should tell the daughter that her father is dead  and the thing that remains is not her father  but the thing that killed him.
@blackdragoonv7  he left his wife
for real! i watched that recently and he s absolutely right. it s like  why does the transgender persons feelings outweigh everyone else s around them  especially when there s so many men and women that are negatively affected by this one person yet they re transgenderism makes their feeling more valued  or some thing  because they were slightly marginalized before society elevated them to god status   now days they can pretty much do anything they want and get away with no repercussions.
why are you listening to matt walsh
@dragonage2ftw   bc he has no life
i wear that title as a badge of honor. i ve learned a whole lot about myself since gen z grew into late teens early twenties   finally graced us with the answers to all of man s mysteries that we didn t even know existed before they came along   told us .this generation has all the answers  i ve learned more about myself in the last 5yrs than in the entirety of my 41 yrs on earth.turns out  im a transphobe  homophobe  bigot  racist  i have privilege   am a  cisgendered afab   who knew all this about me    i didn t  but i trust the child sages of our time so im a proud  all of those
@blackdragoonv7  sydney watson s video about this makes it sound like they had already split up when he started this shit  which makes me wonder if that s why they split.
@hurricanekitty67  lol why d raise us then
matt walsh has never made a good point in his entire pitiful existence.
@big robot news today  you do realise the vast majority of trans people don t have srs right
grieve  they re still the same person  they just comfortable expressing themselves as they always wanted
matt walsh the guy who said we should be having sex with kids  i bet he s a great guy to get info from
@austin hall  please provide a link for proof.
@lena black  he has deep mental issues. can t be yourself with mental health issues.
@big robot news today  need me more or no
matt walsh has never had a great point.
yes. there are two kinds of people  people who find what matt walsh says to be obvious  and people who are too brainwashed stupid to comprehend the obvious.
@hurricanekitty67  cringey.
matt walsh  and  great points  are oxymorons.
@big robot news today  get a life.
@ekko dawg  you re acting like they knew exactly what type of disaster was awaiting.
@drew mlg  what disaster
@big robot news today
@deadnorth 86  we have to stop worrying about what the  accuser  will call us when speaking truth.
@ekko  the very moment you re married. it s not about you anymore  it s about the whole family. finding yourself is what you do in your youth  not in adulthood. this is not finding yourself  this is pure selfishness and ego. he betrayed his wife and she did not sign up for this. imagine during the wedding day  they vowed with each other till death do us apart  only got destroyed  shattered by the man s lack of principle and integrity.  he broke the vow. he s a traitor  a cheater and nothing is commendable in what he s done. defending him only makes you look as bad as him.
selfishness x
@ekko  you apparently  since you implied  us  in that statement.
@drew mlg  i m 20 and a straight man but i have trans friends so i understand the feeling but it s cool ur comment definitely makes u very cool
not only his wife  but how is she going to explain this to her daughter now  this kind of selfishness and pure narcissistic behavior leaves permanent trauma for all the people involved  especially the people who love them!  i m not normally a fan of over regulating things  but i think it s gotten to the point where we need to take a realistic loom at things as a society and make it illegal to do this because it goes against the natural order of humanity in general and should not be tolerated anymore! i don t care what people call me for saying it  i am a father myself of two boys  and i am trying my best to educate them appropriately of how crazy this nonsense is so they don t end up being the type of people like chris or dylan mulvaney that think they can just do whatever or get away with absolute insanity that will ultimately end up destroying not only themselves but also the lives of everyone around them. i really am getting to the point where i just don t ever want to hear the words  trans rights  anymore. what about everyone else rights that are slowly getting stomped into the ground. it s sickening  and i will not stay quiet about it no matter how mad people get at me for it.
@chaochromemessor that was an old tweet when chris was really edgy  chris is now a completely different person
@haunbeu ii  that is a really old excuse too  everyone uses it. actions speak louder than words  and chris  actions are screaming at the top of their lungs.
@chaochromemessor  i m assuming you think he s a pedo because he s trans  also combined with the tweet  if not please explain what you mean  and if you do mean that i don t really see how an old tweet correlates to who he is now  the chris that posted that tweet would probably bully the chris now  i doubt chris would think to post something like that now  but hey  i don t know him so i can t say for sure
@haunbeu ii  your assumptions about me are wrong. yes  people change. but a change that big is far less likely than feeling the need to switch genders  which no one can truly do .
@ekko  old tweets emerged where he confessed to being addicted to  loli  porn   basically anime that features very young girls  even infants. he s twisted.
@cranberry noodle  lol but that s the old chris everyone wants so badly huh pretty hypocritical
@ekko   she can grieve lol it s fine i can t even imagine how callous and soulless you have to be to say something like that. i lost an ex to this disease. we were only young things at university  with no baggage. and yet it broke me and made me extremely distrustful of people. thank god i hadn t invested years of my life into that person  or married him or had children with him. you re sick in the head if you can t see how much hurt he s caused. his children have lost a father.
@lena black  having been through this experience myself  what you experience is indistinguishable from grief. there s a reason the person s old identity is called a  dead name .
@austin hall  he never said any such thing. try getting your facts straight instead of listening to hit pieces that manufacture drama.
@ekko  when you re older you ll realize just how naive and misogynistic your comments are.
@cranberry noodle  absolutely disgusting
@cranberry noodle  i transitioned whilst with my partner  she did not grieve  she understood me and realised i am not changed  just being a more honest version of myself.if you feel the need to grieve  go see a therapist
@cranberry noodle  please explain how because nothing has to do with gender in this conversation but instead a man finding his true self  it s only a problem because he s transitioning but when the usa has a 50  divorce rate no one gives a fuck because all of a sudden it s damaging and this is coming from someone with a stepdad
@cranberry noodle  listen i understand your more or less pushing an agenda and no wanting to have a meaningful conversation that s respectful i understand i love everyone but you people should mind your own business  both men and women  it s her life let it be please as long as nobody is hurt there s no evidence
@geeebuttersnap  i d say the same thing but that s her son  not daughter. yes  his father is essentially dead. i hope she gets full custody. if it were me  he would never see his son again. i m not exposing my child to creeps.
she probably had to sign a nda anyways.
whats crazier is you tube makes every video check box if it is made for kids or not before uploading  . yet google youtube still pushes the filth on kids.
@jd carling  that is true.
he s literally just existing
this stuff being pushed in front of them he s almost always just in the background or on the side
this is probably worse than if your husband passes away.  at least that is easily explainable  and the poor kid is going to get teased thats for sure.
to much sorry but yeah stop making things about yourself and people won t think you re unbearable
i always think men playing as female avatars when there is a choice is super weird
@roberto rojas   says the truly unbearable person.
@cranberry noodle  i ain t the one plugging my  sorry  ass story cuz some random e-celeb is trans but sure
@roberto rojas  you hurt bro
@roberto rojas  i think you missed his point.  he was trying to point out that just because you feel a certain way doesn t actually mean you deserve validation.  if you feel a certain way that is contrary to reality  you may need to get a legitimate physical or mental checkup because there may be something wrong.
ya definitely destroyed
same
see if you can find a based south africaan lady that wants to escape that hell hole!! decent western women are like finding a  needle in a haystack!   o
@purebloodheretic a non existent needle in a haystack.
skill issue
me too. the world is going to hell.  _
i just turned 34 and i m in the same boat  but there s hope. plenty of sane women outside of the cult cities and in rural areas
i m 21  almost 22 and i m scared that i ll get a bf or gf and they ll end up transitioning. ugh    ppl just want true love! without fear  and without problems like this. i don t think it will happen  but it s happening to so many women especially. i haven t heard of many men going through it  it s always women losing their husbands. i just hope nobody comes to regret their transition  because they ll likely never get their marriage or life back to the way it was  especially kids who may regret it
43 and same.
don t give up.. it took me a long time to find the one..there is someone out there for you
i hate to break it to you but if you are having trouble finding women who are attracted to you  thats on you.  i turned 45 in january and its never been easier to find available women  probably because i now have my shit together.
go to church. you ll be part of a great community that wants you to find love.
@ayla boyfriend or girlfriend... gross
she should divorce his ass and take the kid
she needs to take her son and leave as far away as possible. don t ever let him near the boy.
i torpedoed my own career. but since i began detransitioning 3 years ago  life has taken on new meaning and i feel a freedom that i have denied myself since i was about 14.
i know nothing about this situation  or even mr beast.  as an elder outsider i caught something in there.  he left his wife and kid.  men throughout history have cowardly fled situations  women children  flatout and started fresh the next state over.  now with the internet you can t hide anymore.  so the new way is to transition!  i have no clue what s going on here  but i would ve never guessed even a decade ago that would become an option.
you show courage by speaking out about things like this and yes i think it is demonic oppression in many cases. never let anyone stop you from speaking the truth. and never let anyone stop you from sharing jesus with everybody.
t r a g i c . he needs mental help and the kid needs to be someplace safe
i am 70 now and i am transitioning back and although it s been difficult i feel a sense of freedom from trying to become something i could never be.i was a husband who left my marriage leaving her a trans-widow  rip  and now  30 years later  i am going through such shame at what i did and how bad she had to feel.
thank you melonie  for your time and effort . you said nothing but the truth .keep it up girl   tc
that is really sad about chris. there s evil amongst us and will persuade us to fall away from god s path. we need to stay vigilant of the enemy s attacks and stand firm for the things we believe in. great video today melonie! you look beautiful too!
idk... twitter people have dug up his past  and it is some straight sick sh t. i ve seen the theory that he went trans to get ahead of legal trouble. in any case  i feel so bad for his wife and his little boy.edit - you are showing his old tweets in the video. i hope his wife keeps his boy away from him until he is mentally well again.
melonie talking about talent agencies reminded me of dave chapelle talking about he couldn t even use his own name after he left the dave chapelle show. he was like damn  my own name. they own my name forever. that just ain t right. it took ten years and the loss of many millions of dollars for that to get corrected. these talent places are run by human leeches.
i could swear chris was in a bad car accident where he suffered a head injury  and then months later he starts falling down this rabbit hole.
man expresses desires for underage girls.man decides to change his lifestyle  which will conveniently allow him to access places with underage girls without clothes.why would he do this
rabbi cahn has discussed all this garbage going on in return of the ancient gods. it s spot on and so sad. as a mother i knew this was coming  i just kept seeing too many signs.
if you watch mrbeats newest live stream you can tell how awkward mrbeast and chandler are acting. they were also quiet when they sit by chris so it seems like they are having a hard time dealing with it
i m right with you on the fact we need to stop promoting  this. it s actually destroying people. i noticed that disney has been suffering  i know this is going to sound strange but i think nintendo is light  and its destroying the dark side of things.
thank you. i ve been saying this to anyone who ll listen. this stinks of a giant check and or a giant personal threat
amazing  we need more women like you standing up. god bless.
i ve been transitioning for 45 years  into a old man
let s pray for him and his family.
it makes sense that his transition was part of the show and he was paid to do it.  what other reason would he get a  1 million wire transfer.  he went from making anti-trans statements to transitioning himself. it will be hard for him to go back to normal.
i miss the days when people did sexual fetishes in their own homes  out of public view  and didn t expect to get praised for it by telling everyone in the world about it.
god bless you!!! people want to silence ppl who have detransed!!
okay misandrist
it takes a lot to acknowledge any wrongs within ourselves and to change. seek jesus and he will give you the strength  grace  and forgiveness to get through what happened.
atleast you were able to self reflect and realize the mistake
you should write to her  if possible. apologise. it ll help her to heal.
@cranberry noodle  sadly  not possible. she died in 2012. rip.
@william walton  at least...
@celeste essel you americans with your jesus all the time. please give it a break.
how come this change after so long
@andre rijn  if you had the same experience as me  you would understand why i can t  give it a break . jesus is after all of our hearts  including yours. maybe it s annoying to know that someone loves you constantly. but if u haven t noticed already  no one other than god does that. even when we spit in his face  his arms are open wide for you to get to know him. god loves you and he loves your loved ones more than you do. i didn t seek jesus until i was  20. he revealed himself to me. but before then  believe me  i did not like christians. i thought it was bogus and annoying and self righteous. i was messed up. substance abuse   sexual immorality  prideful. i didn t realize jesus fought against ultra religious folk.   i talk about jesus because i know without a doubt  that he is god. he is our salvation  he changes lives. i pray he will do it for you- and that one day you can understand exactly why i can t give it a break. i would legit be dead. should i just forget and ignore what jesus did for me  and even more  what he did for us all   - if we are willing to receive it
selfish
@andre rijn  i d like to say it was complicated but it wasn t. i d like to say that it was easy but it was hard. i d like to say i had a sudden realisation but the truth was i had been unhappy with myself for quite a few years. it happened during covid when i was not allowed to go out. and i realised that going out was very important to me. i wanted to be seen as a female. doing that after 50 years i had succeeded very well and i never got noticed. i was also the type of person that doesn t wish to be noticed. but however good i was at imitating a woman there was a price to pay and that price came in the form of stress  anxiety  and depression. simply because i was not being my true self. at the same time i began to hear about the excesses of what trans people were demanding and i became horrified. i did not want to be part of those sort of people. in all my years i have never been in a woman s changing room or bathroom and as odd as it sounds  i have the upmost respect for the privacy of women. all this came together in one fell swoop and i realised how wrong i had been. i have been leading a life of a total lie. it is that simple. now  i am not saying that it has been easy. sometimes i do not recognise the person in the mirror for a few moments. i miss wearing clothes that had become normal for me. but as a man who  after 50  years of being  trans   i know only too well the hideous mental envy and pain of feeling that i wished i was born as the other sex. nonetheless  that remains my personal problem and i had no right at all to inflict my tragedy onto females in any way at all. so  it has been just over three years and it is refreshing to simply wear a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and just walk along the street and say hello to people and interact with people in a kind and pleasant manner. there is no stress but there is still a tinge of sadness. that is what i live with.
@jimbo slice  utterly selfish. that s what i live with.
amen! and thank you so much  andrew!
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie! keep on using your voice!    -
30  of that goes to woke youtube btw
god doesn t exist
@cody  cool
wouldn t be surprised if somebody at youtube. is paying them alot of money. to promote this crap. push propaganda on a popular youtube channel

what  are you gonna call the cops over lolis  lol they literally told people not to do it
@david cook  given a bunch of youtubers videos were striked because they called dylan a man  there a unboxing vid out and mr beast looks uncomfortable with some of chrises comments
what other stuff did they dig up that she didn t show
nintendo wants to make money and understands it s audience. but there is more to it i think  yeah. what the movi  mario for example promotes  is assic values of bravery  and brotherhood  and courage  and a man that is not afraid or even when afraid goes out to do his very best  a princess who is badass but doesn t put down her male counterparts and instead  encourages them. for as colorful and such  it still is a story of good vs evil ams tyranny. what we call unwoke is simply stories with these timeless values and morals that do have a lot of their foundation in christianity and so on.we do need more of that in entertainment. just  good  normal entertainment with good classical values.
it needs to stop
@sarn  same goes for the legend of zelda tears of the kingdom. that game is about to be disney s day or reckoning.
@booming bob  1000  thats why nintendo is destroying disney right now. we have seen the mario movie coming out promoting  normal values  that america has lost  and now were about to see a game bigger then disney  about to come out that promotes the same thing  and thats going to be the day of reckoning of all of this.
indeed right now
@nosaj ttimmed  can t wait lol  i just started replaying breath of the wild 2 days ago so it s fresh on memory when tears of the kingdom finally released
@jd carling  fr
@nosaj ttimmed  nintendo   asia is coming out with wot used to be common values
@meester anonymous  such an amazing game. tears of the kingdom is going to be huge.
@booming bob  they are teaching us common values all over again.
@nosaj ttimmed  we rlly need to learn it again
@nosaj ttimmed  yes!
@booming bob  yes we do!
@nosaj ttimmed  we rlly do need it
@sarn  well said my dear friend.
@booming bob  your not lying man.
@booming bob  you know it s bad when movies and animated series from even communist china are doing a much better job at promoting virtue  valor  and masculine heroism than anything from the west.mark from the donghua series  spirit cage  is one of the best heroes i ve seen in a long time.
@nosaj ttimmed  what the hell totk s success has to do with disney  disney isn t even a huge videogame company loli do wish that the  ncu  ends up being great thought  i think there will be some mistakes and agenda pandering in the future but i wish they don t lost themselves like disney did
@nosaj ttimmed  they at least aren t insane on media snd that just everything else is messed up
@booming bob  yeah disney is kind of doing really strange things  and its making people not like it as much anymore.
@nosaj ttimmed  strange things is an understatement
@booming bob  idk anything about it didnt watch beyond season 2
@nosaj ttimmed  season 2 of wot
@booming bob  stranger things  isnt that what you were talking about
@booming bob  are you saying wot  as in world of tanks
@nosaj ttimmed  huh
@nosaj ttimmed  i me eng the phrase stranges things not the show
@nosaj ttimmed  nah as what but how it sounds
@booming bob  i got you. i was a bit confused about it.
@nosaj ttimmed  yesh it s confusing sometimes over text
you know what. many youtubers made sudden changes like this. they became a whole different people from who they were and what made them famous to begin with. it s eerie if you think about it. of course they changed in different way  not like transitioning  but you can tell they change for the worst.first example is ethan and hila  they were fun and genuine people  now they just fueling dramas and degeneracy. then rhett and link  they are in no way who they were 5 years ago. philip defranco  his videos used to be very neutral  now it s very politically biased. those three are the obvious ones that comes off the top of my head  there are more  now it s chris. i m not sure if it s a coincidence anymore.
@orange news  wtf happened to  rhett and link
@orange news    ethan and hila were liberals since the start . ethan used to make fun of his own religion . he supported black people lgbt etc . what you smoke
stuff like this makes me think internet is such a huge mistake  especially when kids at such a young age also allowed to use it
i miss the days where we could ridicule these people into hiding.
@geeebuttersnap  you can ridicule anybody you want i do it everyday and have no fear of being cancelled because i live in the real world where truth power
this is not even a fetish
@roberto rojas  yes it is. autogynophilia is a fetish.
wow  you are a person channel to talk about these things with your past professional experience in the industry and agencies. thanks for being above board and respectful to them while fully speaking your position for us
i ve been trans for over 50 years and now i am detransitioning. i ve known tens of thousands of these people and if there is one thing that i know it is that these sort of people are incredibly selfish and the reason is because it s all driven by sex. transvestites  what do you do with them
phobia means fear  pity and disgust is not fear...  stay strong  love your content.
i have seen him projecting this madness onto his son too. this is the sickest kind of abuse. also  among the dirt was his interest in  weird  fetishes. if you don t think that will be pushed onto children viewing the channel  i have a bridge to sell you. mr. beast needs to make a choice here.
this is one of the few times that i m grateful for never having children or grandchildren i m sad to say
he now looks like that girl in middleschool with the hormone imbalance.
6 20 you do have the right definition  short and petite body type   of course it isn t surprising that twitter is using the wrong definition. though in the case of chris  tweet  liking that body type in that way has some obvious negative connotations when most of those types of characters are children or look like children
i just pray if i ever have future kids that somehow  even though it s everywhere  i ll keep them away from all this influence.because i don t know what to do if my kid suffers from the confusion  i wouldn t really know what to do.
i was wondering what this was all about. you did a great job covering it. thanks
motivation is what gets you started. habit is what keeps you going.  ---jim ryun
it is such a relief to see you back in the fray  @meloniemac  to see that that spark did not go out. looking forward for the mext videos
this is so gross how chris threw away that beautiful family he had.
i m worried that his interest in l li content inspired something heinous at home with his own child. the sudden shift from having what most men want out of life to suddenly coming out as trans could be a shield deflecting attention from even darker issues.
i agree this is just for attention. they try to make the response of  why would i put myself in such a position to be a target for trolling   because that s part of the sympathy addiction they have. some people are so far gone in the head they ll do anything to themselves for attention even self harm. they know people are going to flock to them with tears of concern and put them on a pedestal  which in the end will be in vain anyways.   fantastic video  bless you and enjoy the rest of your day.
i really think what you said around the 22 minute mark deserves a thanks!  do for your channel what you think is right  and brand deals or supporters like i or others will appear as we see what is true in the world
i wish there were more streamers like you tbh. its so hard to find people on twitch that don t just dis christianity
just found your chn   thanks for speaking up  i really enjoyed your last couple vids and agreed with just about everything you had to say so your not alone
it s weird how im an atheist but i still agree with 99  of what you re saying. you didn t mention lara though.
thank you for speaking out on this issue melonie  and bringing awareness to it!
the problem with loli isn t what the character canonically is  or even what it looks like  it s what your brain interprets the lines on the page as.  if one is getting off on something his brain interprets as a youngling  i ve got some bad  bad news for him...
you re very brave to be openly detransitioning during these times where the cult will demonize you for it. i am so proud of you
@melonie mac go boom  thank you  melonie. i d like to say it was complicated but it wasn t. i d like to say that it was easy but it was hard. i d like to say i had a sudden realisation but the truth was i had been unhappy with myself for quite a few years. it happened during covid when i was not allowed to go out. and i realised that going out was very important to me. i wanted to be seen as a female. doing that after 50 years i had succeeded very well and i never got noticed. i was also the type of person that doesn t wish to be noticed. but however good i was at imitating a woman there was a price to pay and that price came in the form of stress  anxiety  and depression. simply because i was not being my true self. at the same time i began to hear about the excesses of what trans people were demanding and i became horrified. i did not want to be part of those sort of people. in all my years i have never been in a woman s changing room or bathroom and as odd as it sounds  i have the upmost respect for the privacy of women. all this came together in one fell swoop and i realised how wrong i had been. i have been leading a life of a total lie. it is that simple. now  i am not saying that it has been easy. sometimes i do not recognise the person in the mirror for a few moments. i miss wearing clothes that had become normal for me. but as a man who  after 50  years of being  trans   i know only too well the hideous mental envy and pain of feeling that i wished i was born as the other sex. nonetheless  that remains my personal problem and i had no right at all to inflict my tragedy onto females in any way at all. so  it has been just over three years and it is refreshing to simply wear a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and just walk along the street and say hello to people and interact with people in a kind and pleasant manner. there is no stress but there is still a tinge of sadness. that is what i live with. so yes  what i am undergoing is hard. nobody recognises me. the person in the mirror i hardly recognise. the few friends i have left now that i am approaching seventy  now regard me as suspicious and perhaps what is worse is that i am grieving for a person who never existed. and time has come upon me too late for i can never apologise for what i selfishly did. it truly has been a waste of a life.
there aren t tens of thousands of trans people.  there are maybe a couple thousand in the entire country. they are less than .01  of the population.
there s only one thing  though  there s female-to-male trans also. stop implying that this issue of gratuitous sexuaiity is just a male thing.
@the captain  there are way more bro. not a couple thousand. i live in a small town in the netherlands  and we are behind the us with this degeneracy  and i involuntarily know like 5-10 trans people irl. which is absolutely crazy. 25  of gen z in the us identifies as lgbtq.
@the captain  i said that over 50  years i ve known tens of thousands of trans people. in london and in southern england.
@ redacted   oh really  well you are wrong. very wrong. that is not my experience. it s all down to sex.
@missmollycutpurse respectfully  sir  by reaching out in times like these when so many vulnerable children are being pushed towards a life they were never right for  you re proving your life wasn t a waste. i pray for your peace.
50 years is gnarley
i ve always known this and it is honestly really hard to not hate all  trans people because of it.  the targeting of children is especially heinous.  the activists say trans rights are human rights but trans rights are completely contrary to the rights of both men and women  therefor human rights.  there are trans-rights or human-rights and they are incompatible with one another.  good for you by the way.
@ redacted   oh its all about sexuality. it s degradation against sex.
@ethan  many thanks  ethan.
ha!
well  huh.
judging by my own research into this  i have to agree. sex seems to be a driving motivator for this.
@molly cutpurse  omgosh molly  your story and explanation of feeling like you ve simply been deceiving yourself was incredibly moving. even without meeting you  i have immense respect and empathy for you   particularly describing your life as a complete waste . when in actual fact  you have mind blowing knowledge  the likes of which is desperately missing among the neo trans that you can impart upon them possibly saving future lives of the tragedy you ve experienced  you should sign up to volunteer your knowledge in the form of talking seminars with groups like gays against groomers and drag queens against children s story hour. they re constantly looking for new contributors to their line up in the fight against this insanity be selling a lie to particularly vulnerable people. just imagine the mind blowing knowledge and experience you could pass down to those contemplating starting on a similar journey such as yours and the immense amount of pain and heart break you could save them from having to endure. take care molly and much love
@molly cutpurse  you don t know tens of thousands of people period  let alone tens of thousands of trans people
@yeah right  let me say it again. over the course of 50  years of being trans in london and southern england  i have known tens of thousands of trans-people.
wow this is a crazy story. did you take hormones and get any surgery or just dress as a woman as i can imagine the former being very difficult in the 70s 80s. hopefully you re getting some sort of counciling now to help as that s a long time you ve been living another life. on a positive note you can live your latter years as your true self and hopefully  eventually  feeling at peace with who you are. best of luck.
@ckwinn11  hi  it s actually a thankful story. because when i was 16 my mother took me to a gender clinic in london and plans were made for me to begin the process. however once they found out that i had migraines since i was five years old they told me that if i went on hormones there was a chance that the hormones would make the migraines far worse. in my teenage years the migraines were terrible. so i was never allowed to begin the process. it is as simple as that. of course  i was extremely disappointed at the time but i made the most of life and of course now i am extremely thankful that i did not go through with it. so i ve lived basically in two worlds and that was how i remained until three years ago when i finally found myself again. thank you for writing.
@melonie mac go boom  amen to that!
@molly cutpurse  how naive you must think chris is for saying his life has been saved when it has only been a few months. dang  you ve really lived it  though.
no you didnt.
@fxrrxt2x  that s interesting. because back in the day  i would have said exactly the same thing! a whole new life opened up before me and i was never happier. you see  there is no cure for pleasure. all that can happen is  he must wait and mature. and i can almost guarantee that his child will grow up  if not hating him  then actively disliking him. and that is what is happening all across the world with these selfish men.
@j l  no i didn t...what
@good is evil evil is good  thank you for your thoughts. as to the book  i m not convinced that it would make any difference at all. i ve written eighty-two novels and had six best sellers and have you ever heard of me  not that i am scared in the least of what it may do to my reputation. it s just that  how can one fight an avalanche  i believe this trans-epidermic will die a natural death.
@molly cutpurse  your life is not a waste  give it to god to transform it! tell jesus about it and ask him for help. he will help you share your story so you can help many others avoid destruction. please turn it over to him while you can!!!!!!!!!!!!!! there is hope   may he breathe life into your soul so that it shines and is lifted high
thanks for speaking up!
@dethraxx maybe the proper way to phrase it is there are tons of trans people with fetishes but only .001  of the population has gender dysphoria. the later was never a problem  the former is becoming a huge cult like problem on society.
@skyclear  true  but they are lumped together in the same group.
@dethraxx  unfortunately true.
@molly cutpurse  your life is not wasted  3 i am so sorry for your pain but you sharing your story is going to help many young people from making the same mistakes. thank you for sharing your perspective that so many are afraid of.
@molly cutpurse  but you sharing your story makes all that experience unwasted. you are helping others by sharing what you went through. and that is not a waste of a life.
@oliviabrooke1993  thank you. i m okay. i m getting there.
@idoit4lolz  thank you idotit4lolz i am thinking of putting up a video of my experiences. even through it will get lost in the algorithm!
@molly cutpurse  if it helps one person then it is worth it. you have a lot of character to openly talk and inform. it should be part of the education before allowing any sort of hrt or surgeries.
@idoit4lolz  i could not agree with you more. thank you.
exactly  its all sex sex sex  they are so obsessed it is literally all they talk about
spoiler alert  you were noticed  always and everywhere  we just didnt speak on it
@william walton  so very true.
exactly  but i have to admit many of these freaks are nightmare fuel.
they all do which is crazy
@luca peyrefitte  and i  as a homeschooler  thought that my middle school was hard.
they all look like the kid in school that wore cat ears and shit
thank you! i was hoping i did ok
what  issue  how is any of this an issue
healthy brains will go  aww  that s cute  when they see a youngling.  sick brains will go  mmmm  i want to put my seed in it
very good point and glad someone made a mention of this. seems no one can even enjoy anime anymore without that part always being brought up.
well i have bad  bad news for you. loli is rampant. it s everywhere and it s extremely popular. no one person can be called out by it because it s widely accepted. we d have to tear it all down first if we want him to face consequences.
@dearth of doohickey s  as perkele  said healthy brains will go  aww  that s cute  when they see a youngling.  sick brains will go  mmmm  i want to put my seed in it
@oskarasnaus da  we re not just talking about creeps looking at innocent pictures. loli is a popular genre of porn. often times it s straight up cp. there is no  aww that s cute  excuse. and yet it s so popular people aren t even ashamed of it.
@dearth of doohickey s  and thats the problem some people  intpretate it as younglings
@oskarasnaus da  yes that is obviously the problem. and also sometimes there s no interpretation needed . it s literally a child.
@dearth of doohickey s  you think lollicon is bad try todlercon and yes i did reaserch so you dont have to and now i wanna end myself
melonie  i m proud of you  cause you are not afraid to say what is really going on in this industry  talking about god  demons  satanists and all of this  you have to know you are not the only one who is seeing this  i wish you all the best  3
no amount of money or fame is worth doing something like that to yourself or your family!
this is honestly the biggest drama that has happened in the mr. beast community. it s honestly crazy!
transphobia  isn t prejudice.  it s self-preservation.  there is a disproportionate amount of that group of people committing horrific crimes  or at least threatening to.
we can all thank human secularism for all of the problems we face today.
wouldn t surprise me since mr beast gives off the golden calf from the ten commandments levels of vibes.
absolutely he was paid to promote this lifestyle to kids.
there seems to be a pattern where someone who has recently being doing good things or is noted for doing good things get railroaded by controversy that counters all the good they did. a recent coincidence. i feel for his wife and child.
melonie  i recently stumbled upon your content recently and have been hooked  your probably the greatest voice on the platform in these times  keep up the great work.
my church started a new series yesterday called  act like men  and yesterday my pastor straight up went scorched earth on the alphabet mafia. he quoted a line about how to act like men  the men need to be watchful about the culture. he never mentioned this guy but he did say that men need to step up and call out how this stuff is wrong. we are god s masterpiece. we were not made a mistake. they need the children to further their agenda. be watchful and call it out.
love your content   god bless . i pray there were more woman that would think   dress  think like you. you are a woman of god.
can t wait for the mr beast video in the upcoming years of them paying for thousands of  gender corrective  surgeries and how it is going to save lives and all that crap.
love this melonie keep up the good work!
this shows that ppl can have everything  and still not be satisfied. sad world we live in
just found your channel.  great to see theres still rational logical women whos not scared to speak up and tell the truth.  its goimg to take all the real men and women working together to bring positive change and eliminate the trans influence on our youth.
that s even more disturbing if it was done for esg standards. there s some wild stuff happening right now with the bud light debacle.
i miss the days when people kept their fetishes to the confines of their own bedrooms and nowhere else. i don t care what people think or do in the privacy of their own castle walls  but why must people feel the need to publicize all their weirdest kinks to the world through social media  especially under their real names official accounts--that is something i ll never understand. it s as if pandora s box was opened  and all the evils escaped to spread itself outward...
this is a beautiful woman that s logical and i love her tats. it s so hard to find woman like this in real life.i m talking about the actual woman making this video.. not the fake woman she s talking about
paid or not  this situation is...awkward to say the least. and i feel bad for chris  ex-wife and kid. imagine what they re going through.
you re not wrong melonie. we are in a spiritual war. all of this stuff is demonic and the people who fall into this trap need our prayers. it s awful that they re promoting this stuff and that kids are more likely to fall for it.please pray for the children and these adults. god bless you all!!
@oskarasnaus da  yeah  no thanks. i d rather eat glass.
@dearth of doohickey s   literally   do you even understand what that word means  these are fictional characters that aren t real. they re imaginary. good lord.
gods not real grow up
@austin hall  i m sorry  but you know nothing
@wyderka    you believe in a fairy tale book but i know nothing lol
@austin hall  i belive in god  not in a book  because this book was written by people  and changed many times over the years  and people are often lying or just wrong
which is probably why he wasn t paid or forced to do it
no  it s transphobia.
@jay   phobia  means an irrational fear.  this one is very rational.
are this people in the room with us right now
@roberto rojas  sounds like it s far more likely for you than anyone else.
i would be wary of anyone who identifies themselves as  beast . does this mean chris is the whore of babylon  must say  i never pictured the scarlet woman as trans but it kinda makes sense when you think about it.  this is me only half-joking. half of me is deadly serious
@fistov uzi  had a friend of mine treated to defend this and say   you re being too hateful  chris was always this way this is why we should wait for all the information to come out and it looks like my mockery was well justified.
he should check himself into an insane asylum
mr beast has a lot of connections and those who flaunt themselves doing good things also have things to hide.
@yukipyro    those who flaunt themselves doing good things also have things to hide. been saying this for years about mr beast.
why you feel bad for them   as far as i know  they broke up before he came out as trans.and many marriages go bad  its not smth rare
@jadempinky  lots of people are crippled too. doesn t make me stop feeling bad for them
the kid is being ignored for the most part. do what ever you want in life but if you got kids you can t just stop being a parent. this doesn t mean people don t stop it s just sad and wrong no matter who you are. but just like any other dead beat parent if you do that your child is better off without you because no child should have to fight for your love.
@jessica hanson  idk where u got that information-chris did not gave up his child  in fact  he even said that he did that for his child  so that he would be a better self and a better parent.
@jessica hanson  he didn t give up his child...
@jessica hanson  i made a typo.. i meant chris did not gave up his child  sorry for the confusion
@jadempinky  oh ok that s fine we all do it i was so confused
our great war is a spiritual war... our great depression is our lives
@jason sierchio  fight club  my man.
i think it s probably more likely that money was given to him to pay the wife off so she wouldn t go public with any drama between them. the talent agency wants to keep their talents image clean as possible.
glad you cover this. i would not ever hear about it if not for this channel.
the can of worms this damn chris has opened onto the lap of his old friend  who sheltered him and gave everything so that he could have a house and a wife and all  it s 100 levels of disgrace and treachery. they want to undermine mr beast and they got to him through chris.also this damn chris bought high-heels baby sized to his kid  long ago  and dressed him with girly dresses on purpose. it was a tragedy waiting to happen and yes  hrt induces a huge slew of different types of dementia  the worst are those that can t feel good if they don t cause pain to others and the other one is the one that ellicits self-deletion to make that state to stop  the other is the regular hysteria that makes them bloat like toads  specially around the neck area because their thyroids go bonkers with the hrt  that makes them yell to the top of their lungs. hysteria was an issue that was treated in the past on women by removing their reproductive organs all together  hysterectomy . hrt for gender affirmation don t save lifes  it destroy them from within in a slow painful spiral of suffering  specially if they were healthy people with no record of underdevelopment of their genitalia.
if you re a  jesus freak  then i m proud to say i m one too.
when are we going to allow people to live freely.
honestly  my worry is a lot of millennials and zelennials are raising kids but they are completely unaware of how to properly raise themthey would much rather have them exposed to things that are not suited for them at that age yet children are learning about autonomy as well as social skills. yet we have these groups of weirdos raising their children in this light where i can see it being detrimental and almost as bad as how we are seeing teenagers and young adults nowso much for trying to end the trauma when the parents are not being a good influence  thus leaving their children to only mimic their behaviors
what can motivate this   if we ve learned anything over these last years it s if there are kids present the ts are sure to follow. why they focus so much on kids i don t know  look at how often kids in classrooms have to deal with this shit. given mr beasts fan base it was only a matter a time before they tried to slip the agenda in somehow.
you nailed it when you said sexual degenerate behavior leads to a depraved mind...
the troon response is  who cares what he s doing he s not hurting anyone and he s living his best life finding happiness  imagine his widow reading all of these comments and having almost no one having any sympathy for her and her son.
all i know is mr beast is a guy that people got mad at for doing wonderful things for people.how he got money  i have no idea.
if jimmy is gonna continue having chris on the show  youtube should not promote him on youtube kids. his audience comprises of young impressionable children.
don t stop melonie  keep going  we support you!!
hey melonie it s great to see you. you look beautiful. love the work out vibe backgroud. take care melonie
he is a danger to his own kid the family desperately needs to step in here
i d just like to point out when chris posted the pic of his son wearing high-heels stating  tucker chose to slay this morning   that wasn t just a child that found mommy s high-heels and put them on himself  those heels are child-sized. chris purposely got child high-heels for tucker to wear.
subscribed  love the honesty and courage
i never understood why some people base their identity on their looks and how they are perceived by others  it s such an alien concept for me and for everyone i know  maybe it s just an american thing  in eastern europe it s a totally alien concept  i am who i am just because  if i would wake-up in the body of a woman tomorrow or a dog or whatever   i will still be me  it wouldn t change who i am.
9 55 the water gun emoji just makes that tweet even more comical. their own kind has made it impossible to make an actual threat.
you work for 40yrs to have  1m in your retirement  meanwhile some people are putting just  10k in a meme coin for just few months and now they are multimillionaires  all thanks to mrs anna   god bless you ma
back in 2016 i said   surely this is as bad as it gets . oh poor  sweet  past-self
maybe he being paid to act that way for that very reason.
please.melonie.stop.
it s called narcissism and machiavellianism
wow i  m just shock someone mentioned expert mrs anna i thought i m the only one trading with her
she helped me recover what i lost trying to trade my self
i think i m blessed because if not i wouldn t have met someone who is as spectacular as expert mrs anna   i think she is the best broker i ever seen
i m glad to see denali mentioned here  my spouse recommended her to me after investing  4000 and she has really helped us financially in times of covid - 19 lock down here in australia
i m from australia and i have been investing and earning massively with the help of anna   all thanks to her
how can i reach out to mrs anna   i urgently need her to manage my investment please!!
i think i m interested how can i get in touch with mrs anna
yes of course  she s always active on what s app .x
180
that s her info on what s apk messenger
thanks for the recommendationi just contacted her and she attends to me nicely
wow i just make my second withdraw again today trading with expert mrs anna
i am happy today because of mrs anna i remember friends calling me crazy when i started but now i shut up them with my four figure weekly returned
i m from uk      i used to take loan from the bank for surviver but after trading with expert mrs anna she changed my financial status for real.
i m now a creditor not debtor anymore.
she s technical analysis is dope and her interpretation projections of the market is so accurate i sometimes ask myself if he is human haha. point is  marueen is the perfect trader to follow for advise and daily signals
she s the key to cryptoshe really made name for herself
i m not here to converse for her but to testify just for what i m sure of  she s trust worthy and best option ever seensometimes i wonder if she s used magic power trade
a friend that i referred to her just received  7 050 profit after 10 days of investing....i became jealous.. lol
she s not like other brokers that will star telling you stories and excuses why they trade didn t go well after collecting your money
my first experience with her gave me the assurance that has made me to invest without fear of loosing
those scammers they promise to make up to  50 000 profit within the space of 7 days with just  500 to invest and end up not even refunding your capital but she s a woman of integrity  with  500 he will tell you she can only make profit within the range of  4000 to  8 900 and she actually delivers.... she s great
any one thereplease how can i reach this mrs anna
yes she is always online massage her now
copy it this way youtube is frustrating
trade with her and remember to share testimonies with others
her method surprises me. when i saw testimonies all over the place i thought it was made up stories till i was convinced and gave it a try and honestly i don t regret the move i made because i invested in a big way
i m from usa       i and two other of my friends tried her immediately we testified  her performing wonders   she gave her clients nice attention
anyone who she handles he s or her trade for l believe is so lucky
yes but do you know l have been paid out today
thanks allot i just sent her a message and he attended to me nicely  such a nice woman
stop the cap
it s terrible how you all don t see how you re the problem. keep it up tho. trust me  we see you all
outstanding!  you did great!
i  in general  don t care what any adult wants to do to their body  what kinks the have  etc  as long as it doesn t effect me or others around them negatively  and as long as they keep it away from children.  cut body parts off  get new ones  created   tattoo yourself head to toe as a reptile and split your tongue  anyone remember that guy from over a decade ago  ... i might advise them to put some serious thought into it because it might impact their futures  get some therapy to figure out why  etc  but i won t stop them as adults who can make up their own minds.  pushing it on children is seriously wrong.  and do not expect me to go buying into your delusions and treating you special  i m not going to date a guy with a beard who insists he s a woman - and call me a transphobe or bigot all you want  i have my preferences and that s not one.
prayers for his wife and child  your not being mean  this is sad and people no matter who shouldn t just turn from away from family and responsibilities that come with growing up
the fact that she s divorcing him and taking the son  is enough to know how she feels about it lmao.
chris was even putting little high heels on his child  he is a danger to his own child.
well i am happy that chris got married then had a child before he came out as trans.  so happy he forced his wife to live his lie with him for however many years they were together.  so stunning. so brave.
i watched a video about  john money  by jordan peterson and miriam grossman. apparently john money is the man where this really started  who operated and changed the sex of a baby called bruce into brenda  very interesting and deeply disturbing.
going boom   great to see you melonie. hope you re having a wonderful day
it s monday and you have a fresh new video! woohoo!  and man am i glad you re discussing the chris issue! also  i wanted to take a quick minute to say thank you...melonie  you and your content have really helped to bless my life. as much as i try to keep up with things happening globally and in the entertainment sector  you manage to pick up on stories i sometimes miss and i absolutely appreciate your perspective. from your sense of humor to your calling out the l s of the entertainment industry  and especially your discernment and understanding of scripture which is such a breath of fresh air compared to the lukewarm   progressive  false doctrine that has inundated so many churches... you ve been such a bright spot in a world that is prophetically moving closer and closer toward the hour of tribulation. i m so glad god has raised you up in these times to speak biblical truth in a world that needs his truth so badly. and if you and your content are such a bright spot for a believer like me... imagine the impact you may be having on unbelievers my prayer for you is that god would protect you  lift you up  help you sort through and make ways for everything you re dealing with  and continue to mold and strengthen you into the woman he s called you to be. while some people may think negatively of you  i think you re a class act and fantastic. i m so glad you exist and i m just here to try and be a supportive friend in what ways i can anyways  that s all i wanted to say. thank you for shining so brightly  melonie. and thanks so much for your perspective on the chris issue. god bless you
chris  kid is going to have a very happy and alive parent taking care of him bc chris is able to live as his true self instead of a miserable  angry and repressed parent that hates his life  and you d rather him have the latter bc you re not comfortable with someone not presenting as perfectly masculine in your view even though it does not affect you  you re very weird
look  we ve all put on a wedding dress and spun around in a circle. but you don t leave your wife. you just do it when she s not home.
gotta love how they threaten violence if you stand up against them pushing it onto children too. hope and pray the lord protects you from these psychopaths melonie. god bless you.
just one look at mr beast s dead eyes is all you need to know about him
that s not actually what loli is  its short for lolita which is a character from a book  and more specifically  a book about a pedo.has literally nothing to do with animated characters that are older than they look.
it s so refreshing to see sane people still exist on youtube!  thank you!!
100 percent on the nose. you rock.
you get my sub for not being afraid to say it this is demonic
a million dollars is a very small price to pay to drag mr beast to force him to pick a side  that he has built or his friend that binds him to an ideology  it will be interesting to see how this develops
it s been proven that lia thomas was exposed as a pervert  i bet this guy is it too and he gets to have a family and there are decent god fearing men out here who don t even get a chance.
as long as it doesn t affect me or others around them negatively . well the thing is  in the case of chris it definitely affected his wife and it will certainly affect his child no matter how much love he claims he will shower him in.
thank you. i feel the same way and always feel like i m weird for not caring about what adults choose to do one way or the other. just don t force the stuff on kids
@swagruto uzumaki  just say you dont care about society  it would be easier for you. you wouldn t get the benefit of feeling good about telling people that your indifferent  but if you really dont care then what does it matter right
@jay dwy  because it s not entirely the case. i just have a more sane view of it. i m not important enough to sway society one way or another and even if i was i won t live long enough to see any of those changes anyway. so no point in getting super stressed over any of it. i m sure some of this will change as i get older  start a family etc. but as of now i m content to watch the world burn around me
@swagruto uzumaki  if you plan on starting a family this is the kind of stuff that you absolutely should be concerned about  and at the very least start attending town hall meetings locally to make sure you have a voice that pushes back against it. or continue to sit on the fence and screw your future kids over. choice is yours.i have kids and all the other familys i know are proactive.
it s a brave new world my friend
thank you so much  this means a lot
@melonie mac go boom no problem  melonie! you know i m here to support ya
speak for yourself lol.
@garvin nash  what are you talking about
@garvin nash  and how do i have  weirdo creepy vibes   grabs pen and paper explain.
the wirst part is that tweet is the day of the shooting
@booming bob  right. i really hope nothing like that happens again  but seeing what s going on i m not too sure.
@moktack  the timing was v bad bring on the same day
@tracy buzogany  interesting
@tracy buzogany  when did this happen
@booming bob  that is false.
@moktack  wot is false
@booming bob  yep.  morgan  never asked for melonie mac s address on discord. i should know.
sometimes the meaning of words and labels change
@moktack  ooh i thought you were responding to my comment   i m assuming yer in the discord
@booming bob  yeah. i am.
@booming bob  also sorry about the confusion btw. i probably should have been more clear.
@moktack  yesh it s ok it s hard during threads
@moktack  ok i kinda figured you were in there
it s so refreshing to see transphobes have a platform! ty!
sane
2 27 what a disgusting person! he had everything. beautiful wife  happy healthy baby. and now he wants to  come out  and be trans  he is so selfish. he is ruining his wife and child s lives. he s not only putting them through the trauma but also literally leaving her with a child to raise on her own while  daddy explores . i dream of having a family like that and would never abandon them  but this  guy  cares more about living out a fantasy than he does about the people he claimed to love. it s things like this that prove we should never have normalized this kind of thing to begin with.
11 49 i knew this whole situation was insane  but i didnt realize there were all these deleted archived tweets. they honestly confirm a lot of assumptions   and those assumptions definitely make this a lot worse      just yikes. honestly  i think most level headed people can see this sort of thing and agree its wrong.   this is the first video im seeing of melonie  does she speak on the lgbtq stuff as a whole  i would like to see someone share their clear calm pushback on other aspects as well
imagine you think you can depend on your husband and then they betray you and your child one day. i don t care what anyone says this is betrayal to just say you re dipping your family to live your  authentic  life. if he wasn t sure of his identity then perhaps he should have done some exploring before creating a family. his wife will have to go through grief and the loss of her husband all the while concealing her emotions because of all the hate she will receive if she was to speak out.
sometimes i feel like we need to just get rid of the internet and social media all together  or at least start putting bans on all the vomit that is allowed to be put on the internet or social media or the news etc...
doubling down on stupidity even when it destroys  to me is what evil is even when the evil doer doesn t think they are evil.
i feel blessed watching your video today.
for many who don t know  loli  is described as a body type yes the 1000 year old vampire thing is a cliche but most loli like characters are adults or teenagers who for the most part underdeveloped physically  we would usually called women like this irl  short stacks  or  petite
just found your channel   i really like your outlook on things i will for sure check you out more  and great tattoos dear  look forward to your content  go boom
people these days only care about that momentary high  money or some temporary happiness but they miss the longer will of being human.
i can t believe he would do this... this is very degrading...
you know what s messed up  in the back of my head  my tin foil hat mode has been screaming at me  saying. what if the big guys on top knocked on jimmies door and requested that big request those 1  people make. and instead of deletion his buddy offered to become a decepticon
i m a straight dude that struggles with my body yet i hit the gym religiously  i ve never once thought about chopping off my peeps and troonsisioning
grift level  over 9000.
just a sidenote but you look more healthy these days. it s nice to see.
it s clear he is mentally i ll   purposefully is promoting harm to others around him without hesitation or remorse and clearly has no true real support around him that will enact on the help he needs. my biggest worry is that chris s friends with deep pockets will prevent his wife from taking his son away from this nightmare.
6 54 i swear people really gotta watch what they tweet. the fact that he even made such a comment. even if it s a joke  you need to understand people will take anything like that a certain way. they ll start to think something is up with you. this is why i don t have a twitter.
now   i don t know if mrbeast specifically paid him to quote on quote change himself  but either way the money he used to disguise himself  as a woman did came from mrbeast. he does pay chris his bills  and whether he knows it or not  he helped ruined his own life
i feel sad for his boy. every other kid s dad will definitely beat up his dad.
melonie great to c a new video from u  hope ur having a great day
with everything going on...how could he not be paid off
if anything she should be happy that this weirdo is gone from her life now  i mean  just look at his old tweets man.but yeah  it s a shame
or you can just limit your time on here like a responsible adult.
thank you so much
heck ton  i just love her wholesomeness
thanks for the info. i am glad a few christian channel is covering this. also what is odd about mr beast s channel is it never comes up on my feed while i am logged in. i have to search for it or log off to find it. it will come up if i am logged off but not while i am logged in. also i did discover that mr beast started off as a christian as pointed out by another christian channel .  which was a surprise to me as i avoided him because of the name i mean beast as in the mark of the beast i know strange reason but that could explain also why it does not come up while i am logged in.
i m not too familiar with mr.beast and i m even less familiar with this chris guy. but looking at him and his family he most certainly threw it all the way and it was a selfish and cowardice move on his part.even if he did feel this way his whole life he should have made this decision before he decided to get married and have a child  they didn t sign on for this insanity.
i guess us normies take it for granted  but imagine being that kid  like that s your dad..yikes.
i was telling my wife the same thing. think about it. mrbeast is the most popular and beloved content creator on the planet. his content is genuinely wholesome  funny  entertaining  and in his case extremely generous. you can t not help but love what he s doing. and isn t it odd that some leftist outlets have been trying to attack him with no success all of the sudden  chris is transitioning  we all know that the world of trans is incredibly divisive. no better way to divide his community to plant in a newly transgender chris into the equation. if you ask me  it s 100  a psy op. it s happened time and time again in the world of culture. anyway  that s my tinfoil take. i dont think this is authentic at all especially considering their older content videos poking fun of the gender narrative.
i admire how you re spirituality  and i do agree there are in fact satanic works at play corrupting our world.
mel you are my favourite jesus freak. own it sister  the enemy shows his head - we are duty bound to knock it off. we are not of this world  -  much love!
it could very well be just for one of mr.beast next videos  see what sort of social media outrage they would get out of it. if it is  it s in poor taste  but it does sound like one of them mr.beast challenge type thing.
whenever mel says she s not that womanly... all the dudes watching  including myself   but mel  you re the most womanly  woman  whoever womaned.
i really feel for the real people suffering from body dismorphia all this trans trend blowing up is just giving them bad attention body dismorphia is a rare thing anf a rare mental condition and not this widespread like it is today and like she said its mostly for attention and fetish like she said and its just sad because it devalues the real cases
i feel very bad for his boy.  hoping he lets him be himself and doesn t try to sway him in a certain way like we have seen before.
guess i m not one of those struggling about this  since i am playing this on max volume  in a wal-mart...
you did not mention this in the video but  chris could be posed as he did say  we are legion  in one of the videos or live streams.
if they were real friends this behavior would have been called out
this is the first i m hearing of any of this stuff with mr. beast s friend. no sir  i don t like it. and if the guy was already in a dark enough place to transition he s only making it worse for himself as he ll do irreparable damage to his body instead of seeking the help that he truly needs. pray for the poor man
ugh!  i ve never heard of this person or these people or the show on youtube. thank you very much now i just got an earful and eyeful  ugh.
and there is more to say. there is an extraordinarily high percentage that say they are happy. in all my years i ve only known two that were truly happy in themselves. of course  they appear to be happy but i can assure you when you sit down with them and have a serious conversation in private that s when the truth comes out. and that goes for the wives as well. in public  they are all smiles and they say  my husband is so much nicer now. my husband is so much more gentle and kind. but in private  they hate it. they will not admit to this in public because what woman will admit that she is wrong and made a mistake  the entire fiasco is built upon deceit and lies.
he can do as he understands is best for him.  however i will think about this situation per my understanding of what is better for our communities
that s a good question. as i ve told people  recent events are looking more coordinated than coincidence.
highly recommend trans by helen joyce. really good scientific look at this craziness.
most women have no idea how they look to us.
he s already grooming his boy. he posted a picture of his boy in high heels claiming his boy  chose  to slay today
@adam clark  i seen that yeah. those shoes had to have been specifically bought as well given the size. praying for him and hoping his mother keeps a good hold on him and gets most of the parental rights.
it s sad
@adam clark  not long just heard this slaying thing  my 10 yr old nephew was doing all the slay actions  it s some gay stuff that i think is being pushed onto our kids  i told him  that s gay  he sounded surprised  he also asked for makeup to put on. it s grooming  i d not allow kids on social media  they want to destroy them.
the c1a doesn t feel bad.
@bob hope  lol
lol  not a chance. thats how they multiply. that poor woman is going to have to fight mr beast for custody of a kid that isnt his too
i was thinking about this the other day.  when i was a kid  i d play dress up and pretend in whatever was around  but the difference here is that his kid is not wearing his mom s shoes  or his dad s if chris is into heels.  those are kiddy sized shoes.  i don t recall ever asking for kids heels  don t remember ever asking for outfits  my parents just got stuff that fit with my interests like ninja things because tmnt.  i d like to give the benefit of the doubt here  but i dunno... posting kids on social media is not my thing either way.
@olyunged  right  i remember being 3 or 4 and putting on my dad s stuff  sometimes my mother s and just thinking it was funny  there was nothing more to it. hopefully this kid has other positive male role models in his life.  i would love to know what his grandfather s think. also  other question is who the hell is buying those shoes for their child   and why are they a thing
@adam clark  sick crap like that is why he should have only supervised visitation.
@adam clark  nick paid for the boy already.
i feel bad for you worrying about others lives when yours is clearly in shambles
@austin hall   jesus. you must know everything about me  tell me my future
@austin hall  they re really complaining about a non-issue
this won t end well for jimmy a lawsuit is bound to happen and it won t be cheap
my first vid of your but seriously my first thought. you said it perfect! also did noone notice him start to paint his nail and stuff before this. i tried to look it up but could not find anything. i support anything but with a family and married it raises questions. i am not sure how this happened at all.
it s sad that jimmy and the others are just standing by letting chris ruin his life
this is my understanding of direct causality  cause   effect.the chemicals released during climax are the most powerful   responsive combination that exists for a human. that chemical slushy  having the greatest response  has the highest capacity to retrain neurological process . also in the process of acquiring this release  the person habitually repeating the stroking   thrusting action is consistently focusing the full capacitance of their mind towards their stated goal  so it is the most effective way to literally rewrite your nuerosynaptic pathways.since it is the most responsive  i can say it another way. it is the most powerful way to brainwash yourself short of near death experiences causing immediate massive neurological trauma to sustain a new pathway for survival.basically  as soon as you walk across the bridge of  it s okay to touch myself thinking of some one else   you re already in the neighborhood of walking down any of the degenerate back alleys. since these people so often declare their personality and existence based off of their  feelings   rather than a chosen and upheld code of nobility  morality  ethics  virtue    principles  they refuse to acknowledge the responsibility of their own actions in rewriting who they are at their core- and then they end up wearing woman face or fantasizing about children. the bible states that thesr actions are incorrect because it is true  if you choose who you are based upon a lie  even one you tell yourself  nothing you do can bring truth or harmony to nature.
when they can t even get their terms straight like him saying  he s my friend  it s very sus.
one day not long ago the world was half fast normal... one day i opened my eyes and i thought   am i on a wrong planet
just because chris  looked  happy in photos   etc  doesn t mean chris was on the inside.
if mr beast audience is mainly children  with those tweets chris should have been fired a long time ago.
he s sat down and had a fucked up conversation with his wife and said this kind of money i ve been offered is a once in a lifetime opportunity i just have to destroy the family unit to do so...he will regret this...and have eternity to dwell on what he gave away....i feel sorry for all the kids he s had influence over....
worst part is seeing there is a child involved. he ll regret throwing it all away one day and the pos beast helped him do it.
to be selfish is to be leaning towards satan. to be selfless and putting family first puts you closer to god. very selfish thing for chris to do. praying he gets through this.
if ms chris  was a real friend  he would walk away from the show himself!
thank you melonie for bringing awareness to this issue.
damn she been around for a while if the evil is in every other media outlets this is just a new frontier i believe so
i hope the worst for you
chris was probably using it that way and so do others  but it s not the only way people use that term. it s like a modern version of the pixie type. think calista flockhart at the end of the birdcage. smol  no curves  innocent  shy  reserved  very feminine. you have to remember this is coming from a different culture where it is the norm to retain those qualities longer into adulthood as compared to the west. when you see an anime with a young-looking character claiming they are older  that s not too out of the ordinary compared to actual people there. of course  there is the actual media of the other as well.
the ceo of bud light parent company was supposedly once a cia operative.
my theory is that the brain chemistry changes after consuming drugs and watching porn  so different ideas and mental issues come out. this could explain why this could have happened.
chris is going to off himself someday and they ll blame everyone who tried to warn him.
winner winner chicken dinner  now you re starting to understand what is happening.
how much was he offered
@mermaidhaze  1000000usd
hi melonie i feel bad for chris wife and kid and good video melonie
they want to reach the kids    mr. beast  has been very popular in the memes kids consume.if they force mr. beast to do it  his reputation is forever ruined. that s why they went for his friend.chris is a deplorable social test for them.
i so love it when you go boom!
crazy times we re living in
i get called transphobic too when i don t want to date a man with boobs and only want to date natural women  or i don t want a man in a dress going to the same bathroom locker room with my daughter.
i hope it s ex wife finds a good man who can take care of her and her kid.
melonie s mac may go boom  but her brain go squish
i am super shocked when you ve got a group of women pretending to be men they talk about the emotional impact of transitioning and when you ve got a bunch of men pretending to be women they talk about sex. i am completely shocked. i mean this is something i never would have expected. a bunch of women talking about emotions and a bunch of men talking about sex ! oh my god! i truly believe that if you choose to transition while you have minor children they should be taken from you. you are no longer putting your children s needs above your own and therefore you should not be in control of children. parents need to put their children s needs above their own desires. a parent doing this during their child s childhood is not putting their child first. they do not deserve to keep children.
you almost need a white board and different colored markers to keep all this straight.
loli is a very broad character trope  simply  they are character that look like little children  they could be range from real children to adult looking like children.. often  it s just done for comedic or a dramatic reveal as the fore mention 3000 years old demon that look like a harmless little girl...most people that like loli characters only like them because they are extremely adorable since their design is base on little girl..one of the most famous loli on the internet right now is gura from hololive en... loli just got a bad name on the internet because like everything on the internet  there is people that made porn for it... so every loli characters has porn made on the internet.. and i dont agree with people that group those things with cp since it s just harmless artwork created from nothing but the imagination of the artist.. unlike cp which inflicting harm to real children in order to make one.
i hate how divorce court is rigged against men   but i hope his wife takes him for everything he has and wins. screw this and every other impossible woman
first video of yours i ve seen. i m impressed.
keep the videos comin
i assumed he did  high profile platform and beast wouldn t be able to criticize or fire him for fear of backlash
just found your channel. thank you for speaking up - subscribed.
you ll be surprised my friend hated furry and guess what happened. he became one and nows he s trans and he was the last person we thought would do that..
for a man that has a child he should absolutely be ashamed for himself putting his personal delusional identity   or money   before his beautiful child that will now be raised in a difficult situation where everyone around him will now make fun of him for his father being a  woman
ok is  it weird that melonie mac  gets kinda extra cute  when she gets hardcore religious
i was thinking the same thing as well  but he works for mr beast  so who could pay him that much more
he definitely could have been paid off to do this!! such a crazy idea!!! but could be true !  could mr. beast have paid him because someone bigger paid beast to do this  like a ladder effect
its sad chris is no longer one of the guys.  i dont understand it   i  dont agree with it.  but in the end its his choice.  he will gave to deal with the consequences of his actions before god
wait was chris the one who started the identifying as an attack helicopter meme
a good comment i heard recently  when anorexics go to the doctors  nobody in the medical community  affirms their beliefs  and says  yes  you are too fat  we ll put you down for gastric band surgery !! but this is virtually what doctors are now saying to men who think they re women  and vice versa  instead of treating it like a mental health issue. it s straight onto hrt and surgical  reconstructions  of their genitals. chris looked pretty decent as a guy  and pretty hideous as a woman...it s scary this stuff. fwiw  i m not transphobic  there are a couple of trans youtube people i actually like and follow  but i truly think a lot of people would do better to have some therapy instead of  transitioning .
it s sad. ruining his own life and the lives of everyone around him.
i never understand people who say   how can he do that when he had everything    -_-  you can give everything there is in this world to people who can t recognize virtue  good and evil  and they will burn it down in a whim.
it s really funny watching your bare background slowly be filled in with decorations.
also  in the little bit i ve recently become familiar with the generous mrbeast  it seems he doesn t pay his employees his friends   too well.
i almost laugh myself out of my chair at some of this ridiculousness. lol
my 9 year old son watches mr beast so this concerns me. i didn t know who this chris was so after being made aware of the situation i searched him and watched the video made by someone called  sunny  or something similar and after watching i felt really sad for this guys family especially because it just doesn t feel genuine. now i can t be sure as i m not in this man s head so can t say for certain but the thought did cross my mind  could mr beast have paid him to do this  wouldn t that be f d up  i watched mr beast s interview on lex freidman and he talks about how he is constantly looking at what the new trends are and what can bring in the most viewers. i honestly wouldn t be surprised if something like this has come up in one of his teams brainstorming sessions and if you offer enough money there is always someone that will do it.  1m seems quite low though for something this out there especially since he was probably making 6 figures per month anyway but maybe this is just this first installment. he could be getting something like half a mil   for every month he stays trans   i don t know but it s a crazy situation that just seems a bit fishy
certainly he would need to be predisposed to doing this even for a million. this may have been all he needed to push him over though and if i was suspicious id say a reality series is pending about him becoming a woman.
i love this woman so much gives me faith there s still normal women out there
we need more people like you in this fucked up american world and system. god bless sissy
i knew nothing about this and only casually even know about mrbeast but i listened to ben shapiro describing this situation earlier  and within like 5-10 seconds immediately i thought  this sounds like a pr stunt...
i honestly never heard of this  mr. beast  until this situation came up on a few headlines.  more insanity as it turns out....
if he did get paid a mil  then this is definitely a psyop  but then again it would be hard for me to turn trans for even 100 million with the life he had unless i really wanted to become trans.
man this just keeps getting weirder and weirder..... this is like way over my head type stuff. he had a great looking family. what a shame
actually  loli is largely based on the body type  short and petite. it s just that underaged characters fit that description the most  but just about every short girl is considered a loli. like uzaki  but she s fits more the term of oppai-loli  another character is tatsumaki. then there s also rebbeca from edgerunners.
be without fear in the face of your enemies. stand brave and upright that the lord may love thee. speak the truth always even if it means your death. protect the helpless and do no wrong. good bless you and keep you melanie.
cooperstein s tweet says beast had 10m subs after his 10th upload. there is very little chance that is organic. i ve always said beast and that crew was either recruited or totally manufactured
and now the dude has a snap chat of putting heels on his son s feet and buying art from a pedophile. she needs to get emergency custody and get this dude out of that child s life for his own safety.
workout equipment   decorations lol!
@melonie mac go boom  the best decorations  and functional too
i d say that there are a lot of them well i m not north american tho lol   but most of them are afraid to speak up against the agenda or they don t care about politics and agree with whatever seems right for them.
watch brett cooper
a lollie is not just anime. it s been around for a long  time as in lolita. a young girl.
yall would be seen  as crazy if he came out tomorrow making a troll video  saying he did it for an internet reaction to expose the internet .
transgenderism -  man to a woman - is a sexual fetish. megan kelly and her guest in her video  mr.beast newly trans costars bizarre tweets uncovered.  really go in depth about the males fetish  as being driver of the need to externalize the fetish  to continue higher degrees of getting off to it. it was a very eye-opening episode. women like melonie and ms.kelly and her friend are seeing with honest eyes  the degree of sickness in this movement. thank you for pointing these things out. it is a sexual fetish brought to the outside of the body. none of transgender philosophy should be brought or taught to any schoolchildren.ever.
old chris would make fun of new chris.
i don t think it s a great idea for him to be speaking about it on his twitter that is associated with the brand either. he has a personal twitter he can use
so chris has a son and no daughter right  that means for his son to have girl s heels  he or his wife had to have bought them for the kid then.
i saw some video of mr beast and everyone in the room looked super uncomfortable with homie looking like a chick. also  it s kind of like the celebrity in a dress thing. to reach tue next level of fame and be backed by the right people they have to wear a dress in public or some stuff.
i m sure you hear this all the time but shiiiieet i don t see a ring...marry me melonie mac!
the imagination of man s heart is evil from his youth   genesis 8 21 .
dylan mulvaney is an actor    he is getting paid for his  transition.   it would not surprise me at all if a cohost of a yt channel also took money.
it s sick about chris  why lie to a person  marry them and have children then screw up their life s. makes me sick
someone else said it best in another comment. how do you expect other people to accept you when you didn t even accept yourself.
if beast starts to even distance his show from this guy for an inch  activists will took notice   try to start a backlash which could result in loss of sponsorship  brand deals  and business partners  he outsourced his merch  chocolate bars  and rely on ghost kitchen partner for his burger chain if he came out in full support  the drop could turn from an insignificant amount to huge nosedive.  a certain alchohol brand already proved that the backlash can get big if the status quo is kept  parents may slowly drop him   block his merch one by one. and beast will either be uncomfortable with him on the show or try to come to terms with the fact.imagine successfully keeping your big successful show mostly apolitical  only to have the crew destroy its reputation..
i honestly had no idea who mr. beast is until two weeks ago lol
you should be ashamed of this video and your willingness to make a spectacle out of strangers lives
that little 4chan post does seem to have some merit  the night media thing does represent mr beast  asmongold  neekolul and graham stephen  a known youtube grifter . 4chan sometimes does come up with verifiable and accurate research.
unfortunately since all of this mrbeast controversy  his main channel went from 145 million to 146 million.  it has had no effect on his brand at all.
they couldn t pay me a billion dollars to join the darkside.
i wonder does he think he can be the next dylan and get an invite to the white house !  massive grift going on right now.
he just had a bud light
their paraphilia is called autogynephilia  just in case.
there s female-to-male trans also  buddy. i m seeing again men being treated like brainless animais.
@ redacted   reading comprehension isn t ypur strong point  is it no one said there weren t female to male trans people. they said the male to female variant seems steeped in fetish culture.
i agree  also would explain why a lot of men crossdress and do drag  it s pretty much all performative fetish shite. a lot of troons that i ve seen  treat being trans as a some kind of kink  and for whatever reason they won t stop talking about porn or sexual stuff.
a little nuance here  there are people who really believe they have been born in the wrong body. that s an officially recognised medical problem called gender dysphoria. to determine if a person really suffers from this disease  that person is being put through a long trajectory of psychological and psychiatric evaluation. only after it has been assured that the person really does suffer from that disease  gender change therapy and sex change surgery is approved. but even then  these people are being evaluated  monitored and coached through the entire process. dysphoria is a rare disease though  so the huge number of people who now claim they suffer from it  is illogic and suspect.   the problem is that many people now say they believe that they have been born in the wrong body don t actually suffer from gender dysphoria but have  as you said  a sexual fetish.
@ redacted   more some it is a fetish
@tj roelsma  which they shouldn t be approved. it s extremely rare and most if not all cases they grow out of.
@jared  hence the very extensive evaluations. those get rid of the pretenders and leave the real patients  who then can be treated.
@michael vavor  i think in that case the term  attention whore  is probably a proper term.
@tj roelsma  there used to be  and i m sure in some places still are  those rigorous evaluations  but as jared said  instant affirmative care is the norm now and anything else is often being compared to barbarous torture.
it s not a fetish
@ redacted   sing it bro
@mallory carpinski  oh  i don t dispute that at all. i was just pointing out that not everyone who is transgender falls into the attention seeker category and that there are people who suffer from gender dysphoria.  the problem with all these attention seekers and or activists is that always claim to  stand up for the rights of  fill in the blank   while knowingly making things worse for the people they say they are standing up for.the same people who are being told that their transformation will only happen after years of evaluation  just look at social media and see all kinds of weirdos making money with their pretend stories and are able to pay for instant transformation. i can imagine that must really hurt.
@ redacted    uh akshully   weeb!
most people in the anime community use loli as another way of saying petite women.
blaire white made an interesting observation about male to female individuals  she made it clear it she was not denoting this as immutable  but it was difficult not to draw this conclusion . there is a lot of fetishism sexual degeneracy and tendencies toward pedophilia among that group if they are men who are attracted to women and less often when it involves gay men transitioning.
i m sorry but back in my day if a man felt like a woman he slapped on some makeup and a dress and called it a night. i even knew several guys who had day jobs and presented as men on the clock and would wear drag on the weekends. they were surprisingly well adjusted. but once you start actually taking hormones and surgeries that s something you can never come back from. what will his wife do now divorce him  what a mess..
living under a social media rock is now where i live yes.
it seems like a guy trying to escape from his responsibilities at first besides being something to get paid for . he came out as bisexual a while back and has been separated from his wife for a year now . i don t know if this was just something else that gave him a excuse . even if he was paid  1 million to go through this and amass a audience like his buddy mr.beast . it just comes off suspicious at the end of the day .
what if this is some long revenge by mr beast to get back at his friend who his gf cheated with or something lol hes like  one day i will make you a wear a dress in front of billions of people
i think it s terrible what s happened. chris is married with a kid. they ve even made fun of people like that before.
joe rogan recently had bill ottman on his podcast and bill expressed concerns how mr. beast only makes content that favors the algorithm. that is kind of weird when you think about it  the guy is a literal slave to computer thinking.
i highly recommend the book  irreversible damage  by abigail shrier. i don t agree with her on all her political and moral views  but she does point out some very important facts.
every. single. time.
now ponder this  chris brags about recieving 1m  about the same time as that he starts transitioning.  chandler was just baptized.  something just happened  and chandler is spooked.  i think they both got the similar offers  but chandler turned that shit down like a champ and found jesus like his life depended on it.
the drama has gotten worse by the week melonie starting the week out great
this stuff is all so disturbing. takes a lot of courage for you to call it out. stay strong in your faith   also  for the record  you are a very beautiful woman. never doubt that
i found out that he and wife are either divorced or are divorcing and it s probably over him wanting to throw his role as a father and husband by the wayside for selfishness. i have zero respect for him and beast needs to distance himself to save his business.
when people sign deals with the devil there s always a cost. just throwing it out there. i don t know chris personally.
random question - love what you push and support but why is your camera so big  i appreciate you moving it  but i am curious
not to fuel any conspiracy theories concerning the state of chris tyler s soul but in the most recent live stream featuring the mr beast squad opening packages  someone made a joke about chris committing a felony by opening a letter addressed to mr. beast  and in response chris says  in a way i am mr. beast  we are like a legion. we are one  we are many  which sounds suspiciously similar to mark 5 9 in the bible which says   then jesus asked him   what is your name    my name is legion   he replied   for we are many.   when some people brought a  podded dude before him  then the demon begged jesus not to send them out of the area and instead begged jesus to allow them to instead possess a herd of nearby pigs  and jesus had mercy on the demons  can you believe that   and gave them permission and it says that the heard of about 2 000 pigs immediately went running down a steep bank into a lake and drowned in the water. pretty crazy stuff. pretty crazy quote from chris too. edit  possessed  not podded.
you re a goddess
i guarantee you it happened like this 1. he separated from his wife2. he got depressed3. the paychologist he saw gaslit him into thinking he was trans4. we have this shitshow
everything  he had everything at his fingertips  but he threw it all away  and for what  sexual gratification  clout  pure attention  aie  the lord shall have his vengeance. he has turned away from him  and so  when the day of judgement comes  he shall be judged accordingly. i pray for the family who was left behind  in hopes that they won t fall in the same trap  and that they can recover  and live at least somewhat happily.
it can mean both a minor or a petite woman but only one is legal xd
maybe that s why i thought it was just petite women at one point  i do think some just mean it that way and then there are pervs who hijacked it perhaps
me too  and it s a very happy and peaceful place
government lifestyle salesman
plant
why ! did he think he was feeling female   instead talking to someone first before having those hormones pushed in him.
@jonathan sanders  the only thing is maybe try trt and drop the soy in the diet
ya  he has made fun of trans people publicly in the past . troling   i don t know anymore. nothing surprises me these days
when did they do that why is it bad that he has a kid
and by this time next year he ll be married to a kid. possibly his own. that s how youtube works.
thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  of course
cringe
don t be following her around waiting to meet her at a convention parking lot now.. she s not your future wife or whatever
you are based and god is with you.
that gun tweet was tweeted out the same day as the nashville shooting but in full disclosure it was posted before all that went down
only a  million though  i m sure he makes a comfortable living under mr beast  so i find it hard to believe he d do this for a quick buck - but i m not in the entertainment content creator space  so i don t know what all goes on.i must say that photos are a moment in time.  takes nothing to smile in a photo.  we know nothing of what was happening behind closed doors.  that s also not really any of our business.i m curious what happens going forward because we can already see mr beast s latest video getting ratioed  because that is content that the public and especially kids can easily consume.  most of my colleagues didn t even know who mr beast was until i told them  so they re not the target audience  youth are.
that tweet with the gun was literally the same day as the shooting....
don t quit  ms. melonie! you re not alone in being called a  crazy jesus freak.  but you are speaking words that encourage us  regular lay folks  and we will keep supporting you as best as we can. just keep believing and speaking truth.
someone posted that the big push for transgenderism is because the god they pray to is portrayed as a hybrid of male and female. great work  mac!
he s such a narcissist . he brought everyone in his life into this chaos and now they have to worry about the alphabets coming after them .i want to see him cut his deener off   or i don t believe him
i am proud to say i have never watched a mr beast video
it really wouldn t surprise me. what demographic makes up most of mr beast s audience  kids.....don t tell me there is not an agenda when this stuff is forced in front of kids from multiple angles. schools  films  music  youtube  advertising.....it s everywhere.
his son didn t just put on mum s shoes.these high heels were his son s size.he ordered them for him.wtf
my personal theory of what s going on is that chris had separating with his wife  and it kind of broke him. and the transgender colt  pray on the week and vulnerable  especially when people are in tough situation s like a man  splitting up with his wife. i think this situation is really sad and we shouldn t sugarcoat how evil and demonic the transgender movement is.
he s of course incentivised to do this  being trans is rewarded you get to become an even bigger public figure  you re handed endorsements and brand deals so you can preach about being trans
i m not really even a religious person for the most part  but any time people start chopping of their body parts to be their  true self .... yeah that s not something i see myself being able to support. keep it away from the kids and don t harm others  you re free to harm yourselves though. i don t support it but i also don t care what others do to their own body.
i think chris wants to cash in on that dylan money.
that s like how a lot of mmorpgs have what they call a loli class  that are basic little girls who the lore claims to be hundreds of years old.
what s really sick is he s putting that out there pics of his son to save for gross activities
npcs gonna npc.
the thing is   lgbt are fine as long as they really feel that way  i met quite a few normal couples and people.the problem is the amount of fake and fetishist exist  an example i interacted a lot with a gay couple since i gave them help in their house for weeks and guess what  2 guys that love each other rhat s it .they weren t adult males acting like 6 year old girls like that mulbayne  those from  gay  parades that are near naked exposing themselves to everyone  or being in your face. just a normal couple but that likes the same sex.that is the difference of real vs. fake in my opinion  the others don t care about other gender is more like wanting to act like kids forever  fetish or get away with other bad things.
he said  we are legion we are many  on the live stream. that s the name of a demon jesus called out of someone in mark  whether coincidence or on purpose  creepy as hell either way even if you re atheist.
its called having a life not living under a rock
amen
wait  melonie is a fellow christian
@filipp rumy  i think that she said it at one point
@filipp rumy  yes  she s christian. she s said it many times in different videos
@billie news  wow that s awesome. i ve liked her content before because she wasn t a lefty but now that i know she is a fellow christian makes me like her channel even more.
if she s a  crazy jesus freak  then so am i and i m an atheist. she s just speaking the truth.
she doesn t speak the truth though
she is citing tweet and reddit threads to back up her points lmao
@dragonage2ftw  funny thing is  if jesus came back  he would not rock with a lot  hell a majority of these conservative christians
@mamamob  she s never been truthful a day in her life.
cringe.
a time is coming when men will go mad  and when they see someone who is not mad  they will attack him  saying   you are mad  you are not like us.  - st. anthony the great
yeah that s my theory too. though this money theory is pretty solid.
happened to a dang navy seal as well... very odd indeed.
nah. this ia all on chris. if thays the case jimmy would ve persuade him. if you look as his shorts chris was less in it until recently.
with the videos i ve seen and his comments in them i would say it is part of the reason hi separated. could be his wife couldn t come to terms with his sexual fetish and the fact it was getting worse and more visible to people. cant blame her for wanting to protect her kid.
you are over thinking it. it s pretty simple my theory is him and this carl dude are gay together and this weird obsession with trans and drag society has is really a trend and like all trends young people fall into it. it s a quick way for him to get attention. in his mind he s a woman but in reality he s just brainwashed. when this trans trend is over he ll realize he made a huge mistake but unlike bell bottom jeans and every other fashion trends when you get bored with it you can t just throw it in the closet
@adam clark   you might be right  but chris separating with his wife  can t be a coincidence
@the rod  plenty of men have marriages fall apart and they don t transition in response
@jorm  plenty of people who don t have fathers in the home grow up to be good people. but a lot of them don t what s your point different people react to situations differently.
i saw on the comments section of pyrocynical s  horrendous btw  video about the topic that a gamer server that chris is part of is practically a cult so in a matter of months they made up his mind.i don t think they were solely responsible for that  i think chris had it already in him but surely must ve helped a lot.
@norman readdis that doesn t make sense  mr. beast is trying to be out of chris  decisions and he wouldn t jeopardize anything to meddle behind the scenes  whether for encouraging or not.
@asuka kazama  both theories can overlap and can be true at the same time
@richard mcgowan there s no right answer why they divorced and there s no correct order of events. no one knows yet.don t assume things saying  i won t blame her  because you don t even know if she s supportive of him and suddenly she emerges thrashing everyone who s sorry for her. matt walsh did that and it was pathetic for him to 100  assume the wife doesn t support the whole thing  it s 2023  everything s possible and everything s a trap.
@the rod  my point is there s something else going on here
@ redacted  leaving a family can be jimmy s business if they re really best of friends. if he s concern about on all of it. he should ve given many advice if any but chris probably won t budge.i m quite intrigued by that 4chan theory tho.
hit the nail on the head
going by some of the guys dodgey tweets i wouldnt be surprised if he got caught doing something illegal and shameful. then potentially blackmailed into doing the trans performance to normalise trans to a huge viewer base. feels like a psyop
@ redacted   mr beast literally tweeted his support for chris and said people are pissing him off. he could have just stayed quiet but he has literally defended him while  misgendering  him at the same time by saying  he is my friend . isn t that transphobic  lol
@brian k  yep. but he saw the light and changed back. thank god
@wrestling with art  yup but in chris account it says any pronouns were fine until recently it seems  o xd
i still want to see birdo in the next mario movie tho.
as the poyus l know what a woman is  and it looks like melonie. btw  melonie is super  super cute.
yay  first comment! love u  melanie!
i do think the tweet is a reach  chris was a troll back then  and the way he makes the tweet sounds like he is mocking it more then condoning it. imo
as someone who is non-religious and doesn t believe in god and stuff even i find this revolting. like why would you do that abandon your family. when you marry someone you commit and you re there for one another you don t just put everything down because you re having a moment and think that whatever he s doing right now is the only way to save himself. i ve noticed his attitude his behavior is very narcissistic ever since he s came out. i find it very disgusting especially this whole propaganda crap
natalie mars was the big one they wanted to push with revlon and covergirl
i don t know who is girl is  but she speaks fact  and i like her!if a leprechaun tells you to burn down your house your medicated because you have a chemical imbalance and they think you re a schizophrenicif you re a guy that thinks your girl you have a chemical imbalance and you need help.why do we help one another the other
even he was paid  he could ve decline
oh wow this video is still up. i thought you would have grown a little bit of self awareness and compassion at this point  but nope. just another youtuber who cares more about their money than the people they hurt to get it.
i can totally see him having been bought to do this stunt.  not convinced he s even on hrt yet.  he could be   absolutely  but i m saying i m not seeing it yet.  long hair and crop tops aren t proof positive of hrt.  he s also not acting feminine whatsoever  nor is he trying yet  either.  he is doing the most to raise his profile  though.  he s really working the algorithms by playing buzzword bingo.  if he genuflected any harder he d snap in half.  smells fishy to me.
you don t have to be christian to understand the difference between oppression and possession.they are two different words with two different meanings.all together now.
i cannot beleive he threw away his beautiful wife and son for this degeneracy. my ultimate dream is to meet a nice woman and start a family someday  the fact that he gave that up for a fetish is unthinkable to me. this man is clearly mentally ill.
i suspect that those billionaires pushing trans activism would love the reach mr. beast fans. it s a massive audience. hrt is like meth to some people.  it s all trivial ish   painting your nails  make up and clothes are all meaningless  who cares what your identity is!  i don t want to support chris on his transition journey.  i love you.
this is the first reporting on  chris-ter beast  i ve seen possibly getting a check to transition on youtube where is the coverage of this
seriously  what s wrong with you
while that tweet chris made with the gun emoji was made in the same day as the shooting  the tweet was sent out well before it happened. regardless  it s a very terrible tweet and the promoting of violence should never be allowed.
im glad there are people besides far right wingers saying this. this kind of thought needs to be more than just groypers.
god i feel so fucking bad for his wife  he trapped her in this. she has to pretend to be happy her life is destroyed. she won t even be able to look for support without being called a bigot. man
no idea who mr beast is but hopefully people will stop supporting him if he s willing to push his  friend  down this spiral instead of trying to get him the mental help he needs.
and he is already grooming his child  o o m g.... poor child  losing a father figure and getting groomed...
ewww
did chris have compassion for his family
hopefully people stop supporting him yeah that s not going to happen
the mental help could of did this damage
nice grift
whether or not you believe in literal demons or evil spiritual powers and principalities  you should take them seriously. because whether they exist or not  some people seem to think they do. that sometimes includes organized  well-funded groups. and some  fully believing that those evil entities exist  also choose to act in accordance with what they envision the will of those entities to be. their aims often are diametrically opposed to the interests of much of the human race. that should concern you regardless of whether you believe the origin of it is demonic.
this whole situation thing is so terrible   awful that chris should turn his life back around and turn him back to a man and stay being a man and charge someone who paid him to turn himself into a woman a punishment  ok melonie. anyway i m so happy that you brought this issue up bc now i been hearing stories about a whole bunch of man turning into women and women turning into men and i think that it is disgusting and wrong and i am so sick and tired of it. anyway i m so happy that you brought this issue up in this video for today. hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
paid to be  tf   where is my money then
a million bucks.  doesn t he already make a bunch of money from the channel   of course a million could just be 1 payment.  it is a full turn from his previous behavior.  no telling.
this situation aligns for me a lot with bruce jenner. guy seems like he has it all  surrounded by people who the camera is always on. you are not the focus or the famous one.  him and jimmy started mr. beast together  and you are clearly not the famous one. introduce a traumatic event  bruce jenner i think killed someone in a car crash  and they do something the world cannot ignore ie change genders. i know 3 transgender people and they all share one thing in common  all three had a traumatic event happen just before they started transitioning.
wtf did i just watch
i don t really blame the individual. my speculation is that microplastics and a big deterioration in diet is causing testosterone levels to drop massively. it feels like this is a manufactured problem.
how does one go from this  with a beautiful family  to this the first answer is complete selfishness and zero care that ones personal choices will majorly affect other people who deserve much better.the second answer is that degeneracy is a child of selfishness.
melonie is too damn hot... even just chillin with her hair back she s amazing. go boom!
if it s true i feel like a mill is low  he s already got money from the channel  and with everything he s giving up  there s gotta be more to it than that. i think it s perversion and social contagion. but it is super suspicious. i m sure there has been incentives of some kind  the groomers can t let all those kid s views go to waste.
i guess every man has his price
need to get melonie on timcast so she can get the following she deserves
god bless you  melonie mac.
it s really sickening  people actually want this. with all the statistics out there  any logical free thinking person would stay away from this. people need actual advice for this  not encouragement.
dude had what a lot of men wish they could have  and threw it away. tragic.
this is what happens when people forsake god. this is what happens when a man rejects the most basic truths.
what make me sick about this dude  is a picture of his son wearing high heels. he put it in his instagram  he bought those girl s shoes for his son because they were his child s shoe size. now he is going for his son. i pray for his ex wife  she is confronting a very sick man.
fake christians hating on others   not going to heaven  i pray for you all
all the money in the world yet transitions into a bad tiny tim parody! yeuch!
absolutely correct. this is what i tell non-believers  it doesn t matter if you don t believe in it  what matters is that they believe in it because the cult promotes all sorts of anti-humanity things and makes grabs for power to establish that on a wide scale. they will not leave you alone.yesterday  it was permitted. today  it s promoted. tomorrow  it ll be peremptory. what everyone should be saying isn t  leave me alone   but rather  leave me alone  or else.
good point. maybe they re paying him in installments to keep it going  or maybe he s not being paid at all and is just going through a degen phase
@melonie mac go boom  stay strong. for every jagoff who is against you. there is more who stand with you. peace.
@popeyeandthejeep
@cody  yeah i see what i did there. oops.are u a jagoff too
she s way too based in reality for tim and his crew.
@jayden fryman maybe thequatering
@sandy sandy  i m not sure i don t really watch that channel. do they have a token trans friend
@jayden fryman  no seems pretty legit from the beginning covers all kinds of topics
@jayden fryman  tim needs guests like melonie...  and melonie needs the eyes that tim gets... her audience size should be much larger... she s so talented also  why can t i see the other 2 replies to this   it says i have 3 replies but can only view yours.
@sandy sandy  the quartering featured melonie when she got fired from the game show network or whatever g7  i think it was called...
@jason sierchio  i don t disagree with that at all. she definitely would get more eyes being on timcast. i m just saying tim shuts down christianity talk like it s antisemitic or something. i just don t think it would be that good of a show based mainly on that reason. also because mel seems to be completely against any transgenderism because most christians are completely against it. tim and his crew on the other hand are okay with it just don t teach it to kids seems to be his viewpoint. he also leads the conversation so you know if bossy tim don t wanna talk about something he s gonna shut it down.
@jason sierchio  also youtube algorithm does that. to see the comments you gotta go to the new comments tab and scroll down to our comments.
@jayden fryman  thanks man... and i agree w  you about tim.  although i do consume a lot of his content  your criticisms of him are on point.  i still think it would be a net positive for mel to be on his show  even if we don t get to see her go complete boom  yeah  i m corny  and then hopefully it would lead to her being on other shows.  i really want to see her get half a million subs by the end of the year...
@jason sierchio  i follow tim too. not trying to be a hypocrite or anything i actually subscribe to his after show as well. i just figured i d share the vibe that i get from him. i m a christian and feel like ian is more open to talking about jesus than tim is. i just disagree about tolerance with any trans person really. i don t see a way we can have trans adults without having someone myself explain that to my kid y know
@jayden fryman  i agree completely bro.  you re 100  correct.
some anime today  kids with 3000 years old stay with a 18 year old super grow up over high  the deadly 7 sin for example or dbs trunks with mia even if in that case it s at the limit of tolerable  buuuut just a bit over the limit. but i m not surprise that netflix promote the 7 deadly sin  which is definitely out of tolerance
he looks like the nebula poster.
i think chris needs to resign. quit. mr. beast will be praised  but also get a lot of backlash from that community as well as feel like he s a awful friend if chris stays on the channel with him. with chris knowing all the trouble this is causing for his friend  then he needs to be a friend pull back and quit being in mr. beast s videos. he s just making things so much worse for the channel and his friend s reputation. mr beast has been standing by chris  and you can see in his face how stressed  worried and confused he is and i feel bad for him. because he s a long time friend to chris  but may lose his career and reputation over all of this. just stand back chris and do the right thing. don t put this on other people and be selfish.
this really is tragic!!!
transphobia is a mental illness. i hope you get better soon.
saying it s shady like the friend commuted a crime or stole something or directly promoting something to children. he made a personal life decision nothing less nothing more. religious ppl will always have their feathers ruffled over ppl living their own lives
what made me furious about this matter is that the guy admitted to getting off on child porn and then dresses his 2 year old son in high heels.  tell me he won t do anything sexual with that boy behind closed doors.  i fear for his son.
screwing his family up for sure
it s really sad to see how some people are riding the wave of trans popularity for prestige and financial gain while ultimately hurting genuine trans people. this feels to me like the trans equivalent of blackface.
his poor child.
tipster roasted you hard in a video. you got exposed big time
transitioning with a young family in the balance is the mt. everest of selfishness. i get that adults should do what they have to do to lead happy and productive lives but not at the expense of a family he is responsible for. narcissist.of course  assuming this isn t a stunt troll...
paedophilia is directly related to the gay trans community which is crazy that people are trying to push for them to be a bigger part of society. if you re trans  go for it. leave the kids out of it and don t push it on me. it s a very sad situation. i hope he s happy and doesn t regret it on 5 years but we all know he will.
this seems like an example of another man s life destroyed by pornography addiction and the sexual degeneracy   demonic hell hole that leads to
i agree that the trans ideology is very concerning  especially when it s targeted towards children and also the fact that it is denying science  but you lose me a bit when you start talking about demons and religion as it s like you are swopping one delusion  trans ideology  with another  religion  believing in fairy tales . so though i agree with a lot of what you say  i find it hard to take you seriously.
well chris sold his soul to the devil and now he is paying the price of signing that contract.
paid to be trans how insecure do you have to be to make what-if scenarios about a youtubers friend
everyone keeps saying mr. beast is in a bad situation but it is a situation of his own making and i feel no pity for the rich weakling. if mr. beast told his friend the truth  that he is a male and that nothing he can do will ever change that  then he wouldn t be in this mess. if a close friend of mine came at me with that fake nonsense  i would speak to him privately and firmly about the fact he needs to suck it up and find his purpose in life as a male the way god intended. sure their would be backlash from some  but you can live with the backlash knowing you were genuine with your friend  and were truly looking out for him not only in this life  but his soul in the afterlife.
i always find myself at a strange midway point when it comes to transgenders. on one hand i agree that likely a decent portion of the population are just affected by society into transitioning. however i also believe the scientific articles that express that trans literally have differences in their brains that make them dissimilar towards their given gender. i will never budge on those concepts  some people are mentally not okay  but a smaller percentage are just humans whose brains function differently.
lord  that poor baby and wife.
many would argue that it s mental illness that leads people to becoming trans. believing that you re a woman  when you re clearly a man  doesn t strike me as good mental health. for some people  the belief is so overwhelming that transitioning is the only way forward  but i still think this is treating the symptom and not the cause. fwiw  i m a gay guy  and if i had no body...if i were just a  spirit ...i would quite possibly think  i like masculine men  i hate football    etc. etc.  therefore i m probably a straight woman .  but in the real world  i do have a body  and i m very clearly a man! so  no  i will not be  transitioning   even though i would rather have been a straight woman than a gay man. a fake vagina and fake boobs  and estrogen pills for breakfast is not my idea of a good life choice. being  cosmetically  a woman would never ever be good enough for me. i would 100  rather be a guy with a mind that doesn t quite fit my body  than become a  trans woman . sadly  a lot of people seem to only reach this conclusion after first going under the knife and losing their penis  ...or cutting off their boobs. i find it quite sad  tbh.
i do wish that surgery that alters a person was a perfect job without chance of harming the person. also obviously that should only be allowed for adults. at the end of the day is people could safely surgically change then most of you wouldn t be freaked out about them having a penis  which would kill a lot of arguments i ve heard.
i also wonder if chris was paid to become psychoanalyzed and insulted relentless by every sicko online  possibly lose family and friends due to bigotry  etc
me  gets under a bigger rock.
this is cringe.
i agree about how screwed up loli is  but i don t think i can take a post like that directly. it sounds very edgelord.
never knew who mr beast was till i just watched warrior poet society s commentary on this and then now yours. still don t know who mr beast is. but all in all  i feel really bad for his wife and his kid. that s just so sad.
i have a free tree and rope for chris and anyone else like him.
in this case  even more than a fetish or mental illness  the timing makes this look much less exotic... he s running away from responsibility into fantasy  specifically of being a submissive and or very young object of desire.
it s a sh   fad and it s going to suck for a lot of people. what s more disturbing is the violence involved in folks lashing out over not being  accepted .
yall are so annoying. peoples identities aren t a political topic
i do feel bad for the wife as well  but she made the mistake of being unequally yoke as she is a conservative christian  and he is agnostic.
i admit this is all insane  but using religion to explain it is unintelligent and illogical. using religion to explain something you re ignorant about does not nothing to solve the problem. if it did  then there would be no problems in the world.
and of course notice all the names of the small hats pulling the strings.
regardless how you feel about what s going on... to assume you are paying one of your best friends to be trans  that s kinda just baseless and asinine.
he was bought for sure but it was way more than a million
the funny thing is people who call someone a transphobe or homophobe etc dont even know what the word phobia even means. cause last i checked speaking out against something you disagree with takes bravery not fear. fear is what the people who just accept it like nothing is wrong do cause they are too afraid to speak out for fear of being canceled so instead join the crowd
if i was the dem s  turning  chris would represent a huge win for the agenda they are pushing.
once again 4chan does the research that supposed journalists won t.
never subscribed to someone so quickly
yess! i love your comment about being transphobic. yes  i fcking am transphobic and id say it right to someone s face if they called me transphobic. the way they use that term to weaponize their victimhood is just another thing added to the mountain of disturbing aspects of this psychotic chapter in human historyjust found your channel  im subd and here to stay
how much y all wanna bet he comes out and says he s attracted to women here soon  lmao
so you think it s brave to be homophobic good to know
@ben talton
@cody  people like you should really use a dictionary a phobia is an anxiety disorder defined by a persistent and excessive fear of an object or situation. phobias typically result in a rapid onset of fear and are usually present for more than six months.
mr beast has never been apolotical. in one of his videos from a few years back titled  staying in one of donald trump s hotels  or something like that  he says  does anyone else feel racist staying here
ms.melonie  if you decide to quit  that s your choice  alone ! ... still  there are many viewers who agree with your clips  your content  but  you can decide when you had enough of this ! ...  as for the friend of mr.beast ... we live in a time where many things are possible  so  maybe he got the money in exchange to declare that he s transgender ! ... american people are  now days  shown  in media  television  internet  that  being transgender is ok  even some priests decided that  now  transgenders will be allowed in heavens  americans are  bombarded  with transgender ideology  and  told that  acceptance is the key !!! ...  seems like american population is  somehow  forced into accepting transgenders  or else  they re considered the enemy !!! ...  personaly  i thik that  all transgender people who get involved to  weather is promoting different brands of clothing  make-up  alcohol  or  promoting transgenderism in movies or animations  almost every time  it ends up negative for them ! ... all this forced acceptance is not good
some people think that chris got sissyhypnoed  what do you all think it s just crazy because he used to be one thing and fought for one side  then all of a sudden he s saying another thing that s opposite of what he would say and is fighting for the other side now.crazy how fast things changed with him.
also i had no idea that some youtubers have managers  i had no idea that was a thing but i guess i should have known.
i would be willing to bet that the majority of those who go down this road have an addiction to prnography... not to say that all who look at prnography will go down this road but david didn t set out to commit premeditated murder when he chose not to go to war with his men and not go to bed with one of his many wives but instead was out on the veranda and chose not to look away from bathsheba bathing either.matt 5 28  ....whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
you better have license for those guns. i m seeing definition  dwayne johnson.
wow. no  chris didn t throw their life away  chris started truly living it. wow you are so misinformed about the trans community.
being transphobic means you re normal. everyone should strive to be transphobic. bring back normalcy.
i feel like the term  non-binary  is a gateway to all of this. because any kid can identify as non-binary to fit in or  stand-out.  once you start down the rabbit hole  people will encourage to take it further and further.
if i was his wife i would denounce his existence and file a restraining order against him no visitation only with a social worker and with him going to get mental help  no way in hell would i put up with that shit as a man or a woman. i have dumped family for less. i am so ready for the world ending meteor we are way past due.
be real melonie  no one would decide to change their entire life that drastically just for some bucks.
i sure hope this isn t contagious.  what are these people eating.
the legend of zelda breath of the wild there s an elder character that suffered a bad experiment and she looks like a 7 year old. difference is this character is never presented or sold as anything sexual. she just appears young and is not.
putting the images side by side just perfectly point our how absurd this nonsense is. this dude is completely narcissistic and appears to bully critics with litigation threats  brags about his money  and claims to know the bible and christians well and shocker the christians are the bad ones who will go to hell for criticism! it s completely degenerate. we must all be humbled.
lmfao   that couple looks like cousins
melonie  thank you so much for calling loli what it is. there were people trying to lecture michael knowles and trying to justify it. just because us needs tend to like anime doesn t mean we have to defend the darker fascets of it. i love heavy metal but i won t defend blasphemous bands like ghost or powerwolf.
time bomb starts  eventually well find out about his grooming and abuse towards children
having no respect for people that have no respect for themselves isn t transphobic.
if someone wants to be trans it s their body their choice. interestingly i m surprised when it comes to trans people iran of all countries is actually accepting of them.
poor child  imagine your father transition into this.
i m not going anywhere any time soon
@melonie mac go boom  please do
@icecream cohen  i love being schizophrenic too dude
did chris name his son  tuck  er on purpose
6 30 yeah but you re a real woman hahahaha
if you remember the band against me  and you live in 2023 you would think it was all by design. and i do think that...
you cannot destroy the family without first destroying men first.
he made a bet with mr.beast.
it started with the nail polish  carl is next.
i hope you follow your youtube name and go boom
i believe he is being paid yes.
a u t o g y n e p h i l i a
it just makes me sad
you are so rad.
im abit scared for her becuse chris might sue her but pls dont
you can give me all the money in the world i m never going to change my sex. no thanks to surgeries and drugs.
he post the one with the gun emoji the same day as the shooting  but before . it was posted like around 3 am. i wonder if the shooter seen it before they did what they did
the whole thing with chris tweeting about l li   i feel like 2016 chris meant it as a joke. you know  chris before his mental illness took over
ethan klein was just scammed by an mcn
you ever see the color me bad guy and his exorcism  don t know if it s true but pretty wild.
i enjoy my rock. it shields me from all the bs
i always hated him and his boss and hey! now i know why. he will sink his boss.
he s already a millionaire  but you tried.
welcome to sick  sad  world
for the first time i saw his chocolate  in stores last night. you couldn t pay me enough to be a trans man. the lolli tweet   makes me sick. and i think it s a fetish deal
paid  damn thats f up
you were right the first time l oi is a petite body type for anime
hey you showed up on my feed finally
i thnk he may be brainwashed or even possessed
wow he jumped in fully into the cult ture   is already gr0omin6
either i m getting ancient or you look younger. lol
a gaming youtuber named nickatnyte was married and then a few years later he divorced his wife after deciding to be a woman .seeing a trend all of a sudden
1m to do that isn t even remotely tempting.
nickelodeon probably paid him....
like paimon in genshin impact looking like a toddler but is really old.
what is wrong with this fool he had everything going for him and all the sudden he decided to transition if i had all that wife the kid beautiful house i would never detransition
someone should check his hard drive
i know it s not the topic but this illustrates how pictures posted on social media aren t real. they look like such a wholesome happy family but evidently they weren t. dude probably went from having their picture taken straight to the wife s wardrobe.
ngl  i d grow my hair out and put on a dress for a cool 1 mil.who wants to fund me
seems like a setup to me too.
what did his wife say about this
indeed this is sad
shocking stuff !!!
trueeeee
@melonie mac go boom yes i know mr. beast  hes an x men and a furry.
the thumbnail to this should be alex jones  head on your body.
none of this is likely a coincidence. it s too obvious.
it s a mad world.
you ll never see the gates of heaven
yo melanie what s going on with the walls in your room are you redecorating
he already had lots of money......i think blackmail may be more likely. he had more to lose by not doing it than he had to gain by doing it.
just so i understand this happened recently  thanks
he s possessed and needs prayer.
i ll be real. i f  king hate this. i would love to have a family like that dude does. yet he throws it away to pretend to be a woman  bs.
4 43 i m a femboy  w
god didnt forsaken this man... he forsook himself
100  melonie!!
yes.
she is right you know
thing w chris or should i say christina is very strange not to mention any  man wanting to be a woman is to begin with..just  be happy the way god made you!  iamaproudman
this is such a great time to be banned on twatter for talking about the mr. dylan mulvaney types needing help and not being enabled. i used  t....ies  word so i m evil even though i ve never met one in my life.
i just noticed something. in the past  male to female trans wanted to be categorized just as  woman   i.e. they don t wanted the  trans  tag  they don t wanted people to know that they were born as males. nowadays they love the  trans  tag because that put them above women in the oppressed-olympics neo-marxist cultural and politic environment. in this environment two healthy women are  equal  but if one of them is non-white or has some disability then that non-white disable woman is above the other one. in the same way   a woman is not treated equal to a  trans woman . yeah  i know  that s a contradiction in those who want  equality  but those people are not characterized by having principles or integrity. you see that unequal treatment with some of the women in sports  their needs are below the needs of  trans-women . of course  this is evil  this oppressed-olympic thing  this identity politics that categorize and subcategorize people. nevertheless  in this environment some males find advantage in being a  trans woman  now that it is a category on its own  yes  they want all the benefits of being a woman plus all the benefits of being recognized as  trans . so  they are not just erasing women but placing themselves in a category above them.
no inside knowledge but i wouldn t be surprised if they all sold out to get where they are
i will never understand how and why good-looking men can look like ugly girls at the end. he was attractive  and now he just looks ugly just because he wanted to he someone he s not
you said it at the beginning. the most popular youtuber. he ended up on their radar  so they came for him. notice how only popular things or people are chosen. nothing developed from scratch. only who or what is highly visible. imagine all the credit points mr. beast gets  per the new york post expose  if mr. beast s philanthropy avoids a certain faith group and over does things for one ideology  then you know he s been compromised as a company foundation. if he s stabbed or suddenly something sexual with either women or children pops up  then you know he resisted.it s a silly game  but at this point  i don t see real sexual predators anymore. i see people in the way of a goal and it s agreed upon that the sexual stuff is grounds for removal because they can t make everyone disappear or have an overdose.
after reading into all of this it seems like mrbeast had to sacrifice soemthing to have fame
hollywood covets yt..it s no secret.. this all makes perfect sense..
his previous history proves he isn t really trans. 90  of these people are not. they are living out kinks and sexual fantasy.  it s shocking how many guys totally flipped and joined in on this kink.  i blame a lot of it on porn.
cornagraphic .... i love that! corny  but funny.
i m not sure if you will ever reply  but in your opinion  when do you think this whole woke will stop
the price of fame
once the dollar dies  these people won t be around any longer.
some people will do some freaky stuff for money  and it appears that he got paid to trans his ass
deviancy will not remain solitary
doubtful since it will probably end up destroying the show.
i honestly thought pewdiepie was the most popular youtuber ever  i ve never seen and only heard mentioned here and there some  mr. beast .
nice point of view.
so i m lucky
his poor kid is going to be so fucked up.
i really hope this guy didn t do this all for money
same situation as the actor dylan
i thought mr. beast was a hamburger chain what do i know.
when money talks  logical thinking walks.
i think he has a hamburger chain too where the proceeds go to charity  dude is super rich
the beast system is being constructed
he wasn t payed  he was however quite selfish to do so.
i honestly just find the whole ordeal very bizarre.
bud light 2.0
i ve heard of mr beast but that s about it. what happened to pewdiepie  i thought he was the most popular.
i didn t give a fck about this but if what you say is real  this is more sad than i thinked for sure

did u just say cornographic  lol
who is mr beast
5 53 that s disgusting!
what s the latin name for government there s a phobia for you.
they are after your kids
lmaooooo
not enough money in the world
yo man she aint scared
two words  c 1 a
so  chris s ex-wife is kinda cute. i guess she s looking for a real man now  tell her to hit me up!
man yall wilding i have legit mental illnesses but i m aware and i do my part to keep that away from people but this shit causing me some lgbptsd
you re correct
your videos never show in my feed. shadowbanned
does it now identify as an attack  s helicopter
mrbeast is in a really a bad position rn. we know he doesn t want him on anymore because of all the backlash and because of the awkwardness and because generally me nor jimmy support trans. it s sad how a amazing guy with money  health  healthy kid  amazing buetuful family and a amazing life for some crap metal illness bullshit. if your a man just hit the gym and get good bro. burn some calories  go on walks  clean your mind  take a break and focus on what s important. chris is the exact opposite.
i thought wife supported now guess not
chris has betrayed his wife and son. very selfish.
mel.. there is human man and human woman.
loli did start as just petite adult women  bad actors ruined it over a long period of time
disgusting. man i watched that show a little bit awhile back and thought   this guys has a wife and a kid  so at least this show isn t promoting all this grooming garbage   wow  just wow.
he had a weird body shape as a man and he has an even weirder body shape as a man pretending to be a woman.
i would say the answer is  no.
i heard murmurs..  what s the dealio
regardless of your thots on the issue emagen getting heat for being a good sportive friend to somone that was your friend sins childhood well before you ever had eny money and had eny form of suckses she was thare for him way before the fame and he s being a good dood sporting her thrue her tuffest time that s what true friends doo.. for the love of god people tuch grass and make som friends irl.
i believe he was paid 100  and he s not even trans. it all seems fake to me.
are they paying people for being trans ! where is mah money!
wouldn t surprise me.
god wins.
this is horrifying
we all need to stop tip-toeing around this crap and being nice  go back to putting them in institutions.
commenting to feed the algorithm
wow  you re gorgeous .
7 14 napalm is gross  the destruction it leaves.
he  won t be getting a deal from bud light...
whaaaaa where is all the lara croft
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i really cannot wait until we start treating females the same way you treat transgender people!!!! i ll be so onboard with that!!!
something must have made this guy snap. maybe he was having trouble in his marriage and had to find a reason why it wasn t working...then someone convinced him he must be trans. you have to be convinced you are trans...being trans is not a natural conclusion to anything.
i agree with the demonic influence.
yes
tbf i would go trans ginger for a cool mil
good lord what even !
are you guys connecting the dots yet
what bothers me the most is that he wears a headband like a little church girl..
its a theory i get that..... but its obvious that 1million was from mr beast ...and for being his friend and not some company....mr beast is rich
chris should be ashamed of himself.
i m just wondering where the mom at
13 45 payment stuff
f esg and f dei.  thats my thoughts on it  d.
what they pointing out as well  that tweet was hours before the christian school shooting.
melonie sure is perdy
i am afraid for kingdom hearts 4
adidas
such stupid take  my brain starters to melt..
2 05  disagree.  he doesn t forsake people.  people forsake him.
gypsies
@this world according to me  it s truly a shame. you point them out  and then you get ridiculed  shamed  and negatively framed. it s those people who shall not be named.
he already looked like a woman
wtf he is a man what is wrong with this world
is he christina now
disgusting and violent. he s basically saying he d shoot someone.
you are too conservative melanie. i had 400k at 1 point. really think about it.
romans 1. god gives people over to a debased mind
hey melonie probably  that guy never was straight so having a family in the first place was a weird decision to chose so now seeing him a trans person make it more weird.
tbh when i heard about this i had to look up mrbeast. saw his videos had 100s of millions of views. said to myself  oh its just another jack paul making stuff for stupid kids. then clicked off the tab.
lol i had to pause the video when i heard satan y all are ridiculous  i feel like i m living in old days hopefully she makes a new video saying we need slaves back using this logic
this is wrong on so many levels. that poor child. js
jesus... take the wheel. no  for real  you drive.
i think the guy is just a weak person who is easily influenced and manipulated. social media and porn are the true evil here
what happen to the room
oh no - putting high-heeled shoes on a toddler is straight up child abuse. where is the mother of the child in all this
suspicious as fuck.
hey leave christine alone
my problem isn t that he s turned trans it s the fact he s started a whole ass life and family only to them just throw it away should ve done it before marriage and having a literal child
did he cut his pp
i find it extremely suspicious when a man with kids transitions. how would they be attracted to women enough to make kids
rainbow blights  rainbowlsheviks
cast it into the fire! destroy it! ..........isildur!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hmm.. the bible  really mel
he wants to be famous
i wonder if he is in some type of trouble. making the plan to go to women s prison.
throw it all away because u can get paid by nike and anheizer busch. become woman of the year and become the best female athlete in whatever u choose
you will be paid in karma for the decisions you decide to make and the words you chose to use.
i don t know who any of these people are. being popular on youtube isn t what it used to be. most of the accounts on youtube are fake.
professing themselves to be wise  they became foolsromans 1 22 kjv
oh  yeah  the kid is hosed. unless he s rescued from this degenerate pit.
what is eve
got a wife and kid how selfish can you be
i mean sure  yeah  i think it s deplorable. all of it  every last bit of anything that has to do with it. but who cares. in fact it s good  one less person to worry about being a threat to my tribe when the zombies come...
as the god of war
i prefer original recipe woman like my beautiful wife who is a woman
duchscher  cooperstein  steinberg  no mystery there
chris is trans now  i swear  i stop watching mr beast for 5 minutes and this news comes out of nowhere.
oh wow i didn t think of that  but that s a good theory too
1 john 5 19 says you are100  right about satan s involvement
wow. this synthetic sex movement is destroying families...he was married to a beautiful wife and child and decides to be...a cross-dresser...
all you had to say is president of rooster teeth...that makes sense now. funhaus and achievement hunter started pushing trans and lgbtq shit heavy after the ryan and adam situation. it was so obliviously bad that i couldn t watch funhaus anymore. seeing how they censor themselves and put the trans guy infront rather than being funny and saying what they want like before is just hard to watch.
idc what anyone says loli cartoon kids should be treated the same as pedophilia it s art but art of underaged kids they found a loophole.smh
and i thought marcus was bad. dude bandwagoning the dylon hype.
attacking the guy personally is uncool and beneath civilized human behavior. a little compassion
i have unsubscribed from all of mr. beast s channels.
mr beast should be like  ok he s my friend but he won t be on my videos for the children that watch me  i ll still see him off camera
loli has nothing to do with this mess.
he talks about dropping loads all the time but he is actually a woman  hmmm
short answer  no nobody paid her and if y all belive that i got news for you...santa isn t real either
i had the same thoughts ... it seems like some of these people are doing this for the money  to promote this agenda to kids. anyone doing that  deserves to be cancelled. especially a dude that abandons his wife and kid like that  smh. can t at least be in the kids life  that just sounds scum.. but maybe the kids better off in all honesty.
so selfish!
1 20 this whole video is not a good look for u
chris is a gay name. we should have seen this coming
eee ehs jee ... aha!
you are promoting it. if channels stopped making commentary videos on this minute demographic it would reduce the output  reduce the influence by 90  and people would just react without second guessing as there would be no conditioning. i do get it. the wrong uns should be dealt with but i feel people are operating as chess pieces in a psyop.
huh
hes not a puppet for your lives. he has his own life. and his wife and kid doesnt seem to mind obviouslt his wife can divourse him maybe she doesnt want to date a transgender and thats okay! the least we can do is respect him. stop trying to control him he probably already has alot going on in his head right now
anything for attention
yuck
f    what mr  beast thinks what about his poor child and girlfriend
this girl is so misandristic lol.
what about all the crap chris was talking about trans people in the past
i am transphobic  and i love jesus
us being quiet normalized this mess  we absolutely should speak against it
i think a lot of people forget that amicable divorces do exist.
god has forsaken no one  he forsake god.
what can cause this  i agree with michael knowles. fetish perverse porn can cause this.
you can t assume that someone isn t living the perfect life just because they are not living your ideal view of things. i know you like belittling transgender people on your channel but try and think logically for once.
this make sense
concern trolling is still trolling. you people don t even know chris yet have strong opinions about his private life like you re apart of it.
this whole thing is so wrong on many levels.chris has posted problematic fetish posts about under age people.chris now acting out a fetish betraying hisvyoung family and putting a friend in a terrible position.mr. beast in a rock and a hard place chooses wrong.stop watching mr. beast.  he chose that.kids come first.
mr.beast needs to disavow
to go against god is to against against what is natural  to try and make something that isn t meant to be.  even in buddhism and hindu the thing that causes karma is want  desire   because to desire something is to go against what is natural. if it is meant to happen it will. all things are laid out before we arrive here.  you have a karma to live and work out.  that is why all of this is so jarring  it s so unnatural.  it is normal as an adolescent to question your identity and whatnot but when it goes to surgically changing your body you re trying to change what god  the universe   karma has laid before you...it s sad and i hope they don t lose themselves here in this world. all souls are part of the one but i also think energy can get trapped here in this material plane of existence  i.e. being trapped in hell.  god bless you all. fingers crossed for the crazies.
it is evil to be pushing and showing this to kids . i ve never thought we needed the lord more than ever.
look up tipster the lard is trying to debunk your claim he is a e thot chaser and got caught lacking for loli art
what s that bible verse about thou shall not deface your body as it is a holy temple
take how chris was around karl years back  chris was always visibly uncomfortable being near karl  then suddenly out of nowhere there best buds  then chris comes out as trans  im not saying its karls fault  because chris is also to blame  he was dumb enough to be convincededit  yeah  ive noticed that a lot of people in my town who have made predatory comments about my 12 year old daughters are in fact trans men   although in japan lolita fashion is pastille gothic  very stylish actually  really classy fashion  but yeah  most men who go woke trans tend to be into loli to the point where hard drives should be seized
thank god i don t live in america.  you re all crazy over there.
actually wtf. he wants to get pegged     poor kid. responsibility as a father should take president. sickening. sad. normalizing this isn t healthy for society.
steinberg  totally not jewish
i think so just like that dylan mulvanye or w.e. is a paid plant and i believe the same for this guy another paid plant
tells you about the money dylan mulvaney is getting.
lolis aren t real  they are anime drawings please separate fiction from reality
this is my introduction to mr beast  if this is his content  i don t care to hear about him again.
keep watching mr beast cool i ll do that
and kids come first hahahaha
he s not going to
leviticus  don t cut markings of the dead on your body. ceremonial law  the verse above it told the israelites not to cut their hair or beards. you should try reading the bible sometime
@melonie mac go boom  my gosh  people need to get over the whole tattoo thing. there are a lot of christians who have tattoos. i know preachers who have tattoos. tattoos don t prevent you from being a christian. isaiah 49 16 esvbehold  i have engraved you on the palms of my hands. so in away you can say god had tattoos.
good he doesn t need you
@cody  and i don t need to watch someone named mr  beast
@angry radish  good don t
god created man   but he realized.. he was lonely..  . and made a woman.
chris needs to be fired. he showed support for the tennessee school shooter. that can t be tolerated. i m boycotting mr. beast burgers. i m never going to buy his burgers again. it makes me sick to my stomach that i was inadvertently supporting these people. this is evil stuff.
remember when gays  just wanted to get married    i remember .
too late
don t be jealous of mrbeast just using the chris  situation just to hate on mrbeast   that s what all commentary channels seem to like doing smh
anyone who says loli is ok because it s just a drawing gets an immediate block from me. blocked a former friend for that.
yikes.... sounds like a sick rationale to excuse or normalize being a pedo....
i personally had to deleat my subscription to mr beast. i can t promote trans stuff to children. i still think mr beast is a good person. it sucks he s in this situatio.
could be possible 150 million subs  what other way to disseminate garbage propaganda.
i don t know who he is but  i agree with you from past videos. this trans stuff is demonic. simple.
i m with you mel  100  transphobe
hello does this not describe those  people  romans 1 18-32 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men  who hold the truth in unrighteousness 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them  for god hath shewed it unto them.20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen  being understood by the things that are made  even his eternal power and godhead  so that they are without excuse 21 because that  when they knew god  they glorified him not as god  neither were thankful  but became vain in their imaginations  and their foolish heart was darkened.22 professing themselves to be wise  they became fools 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man  and to birds  and fourfooted beasts  and creeping things.24 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts  to dishonour their own bodies between themselves 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie  and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator  who is blessed for ever. amen.26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections  for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature 27 and likewise also the men  leaving the natural use of the woman  burned in their lust one toward another  men with men working that which is unseemly  and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge  god gave them over to a reprobate mind  to do those things which are not convenient 29 being filled with all unrighteousness  fornication  wickedness  covetousness  maliciousness  full of envy  murder  debate  deceit  malignity  whisperers 30 backbiters  haters of god  despiteful  proud  boasters  inventors of evil things  disobedient to parents 31 without understanding  covenantbreakers  without natural affection  implacable  unmerciful 32 who knowing the judgment of god  that they which commit such things are worthy of death  not only do the same  but have pleasure in them that do them. if you believe that jesus christ died on the cross for your sins  was buried and rose again the third day  you will be saved and have eternal life  this is the gospel  the good news1 corinthians 15 1-4 1 moreover  brethren  i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you  which also ye have received  and wherein ye stand 2 by which also ye are saved  if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you  unless ye have believed in vain.3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received  how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 4 and that he was buried  and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures  maranathaps revelation 21 4 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes  and there shall be no more death  neither sorrow  nor crying  neither shall there be any more pain  for the former things are passed away.
everytime i see trans stuff like this  i remember the words of isaiah 5 20.woe to those who call evil goodand good evil who take darkness for lightand light for darkness who take bitter for sweetand sweet for bitter.
yeah  someone being a woman hurts soooooo many people. freak.
hmmm  just saw your thumbnail and your pulling the one eyed symbolism    very disappointed.
yeah i doubt they were paid to be trans. that s just dumb. if anything mr beast will lose money now he s in this stupid situation that everything he does is bad.
live and let live  so long as nobody is being hurt and only consenting adults are involved you can save all your bible-thumping and judgement. you who s church was responsible for the spanish inquisition  and who s pope s have committed every category of moral degeneracy. judge not  lest ye be judged.
tanto te afecta que una persona trans haga su vida
man  you could have been a famous youtuber if it weren t for the woke bs that started coming up in 2015.
who cares
show me the part where i hated on mr beast  i ll wait
@melonie mac go boom  mr beast hates transphobia so he probably hates you
oh no he s going to be so broken hearted
crying into his pillow
@cody  i pity you for thinking so.

@cody
lol no i m absolutely not  my hands are pressed together
everything he does is bad i didn t know giving thousands of dollars away is bad
i feel like a dodged a bullet tbh  excessive fame comes with a cost
trust in jesus. don t let the devil lie to u and lead u down this path
satanic   man  your content is decent  but then you always bring in this fantasy religion stuff.  sorry  cant follow anymore
and how does his wife support this!   i pray for his wife and his child cause they didn t sign up for this. i know people may hate me for this but  transgenderism should be considered a crime cause it s a tool that people use to get their way or certain benefits.
nip it in the bud  starting with famous people. they say by 2030  most of the united states will be gay or trans. this is on purpose  so stop it now. vote better.
who cares
uganda bans lgbt the american imperialist warhawks are so mad.
what motivates people to go trans  same thing that motivates people to be straight  biology...
oh satan is jewish now
how is being trans political   lol. there is zero wrong with being trans
everyone is so misinformed about trans people. leave trans people alone and mind your own business
hilarious  the west is lost you need to go live in the wilderness.
gay isn t necessarily the problem here  only a very small percentage of the world is actually gay  and with transgender people it s even lower. the issue is social media  its made these things a trend which is disgusting and makes a mockery out of actual gay and trans people.
but the wife and kid!!! okay  who cares. same person different gender
