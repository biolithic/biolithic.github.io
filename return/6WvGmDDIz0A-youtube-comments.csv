praying my guy pulls through. heard about this late  and read that he had sustained blunt chest trauma. agree about prayers  faith  and miracles. we dont get what we want  through God s plan we get what we need.

yes I totally agree about the Bible!! I go to Bible studies almost every week and its amazing!! prayers for jeremy!! he s one of my favorite mcu actors.
