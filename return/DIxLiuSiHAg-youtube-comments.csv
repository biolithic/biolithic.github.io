in response to @10 06 Jesus said  love the sinner  hate the sin . you never said anything promoting the sin.  he who is without sin cast the first stone.  youre doing great  melonie! I cant wait for the next video!

I think its far more effective to show how God made positive changes in your life.  let people see how you are different.

also thanks for being respectful to all your viewers  Im not Christian but I always like your verse of the day segment anyway because you dont force things on us just open up our ears and hearts and I can always take something positive away from it.


if you believe in a God of forgiveness  then I feel like its safe to say that he is likely to forgive your transgressions as long as youre truly sorry and making an effort to more fit within the confines of what your God wants of his followers. just always be you  melonie. thats the strong young woman thatso many of us have come to love  and come back to.

Im with you melonie  regarding passing judgement on... I do my best to be a good Christian  definitely not perfect. but the best thing I can do about others forcing alphabet soup is ignore it. I do not care about your sexuality  I do care if youre a decent human.
