disney   we support and encourage strong women  so we got rid of gina carano who was a literal strong woman  and got lizzo who bent the knee to our ideoligy for diversity and progress. also disney   what you mean the ratings got worse  guess people just dont like star wars anymore...pfff
it s completely dead and buried in the earth s core.  i m with you - i loved the 1st 2 seasons of mando  but quit when they wrongly fired gina.dark empress kennedy saw there was a glimmer of hope in the star wars fandom with the mandalorian  so she set out to intentionally kill the show in season 3.  i m glad i dropped disney  and haven t had to see a great show be destroyed so completely.  lizzo.. freakin  lizzo!!  that s some serious sabotage there kk!and look at the reaction kk got from fans at celebration.  they ll cheer for an empty chair and she got silence.   she s so hated!  much like her trilogy.  and another rey palpatine movie  man-hating feminist acolyte  anyone with hope now is clueless.  kk will be sure star wars is so dead  it can t even come back as a zombie.
took the words out of my mouth with the snl sketch. it s a parody of it s former self. it really does show that it was just an idea  a baby yoda that a mandalorian has to deliver to luke. like that was all they had. once they did that  they didn t know what else to do. so they just gave the yoda back to mando  brought in tall wahmen to be better than him  and just some wacky random things happening for grins. because they don t know what to do  they don t have a story or a plan.
i feel bad for christopher lloyd  being in the same scene with those two.
it was funny that they had her hanging around the buffet the whole time.
a new hope used mostly unknown actors and actresses. the director extracted great performances from them.  great not as in oscar worthy performances  but great as in how they portrayed the characters in the correct tone  etc. daniel craig took the classy approach to appearing in star wars as a stormtrooper wearing a helmet that did not detract from the scene.lizzo and jack black in star wars make jar jar binks look classy by comparison.
kennedy must have a major grudge against  lucas if she s willing to obliterate his company. she s quite happy to watch it burn so as she can be queen of the ashes so to speak. hope you ve had good easter well spent with family and friends melonie.
kinda surprising that jack was in that episode alongside the mario movie  where he voiced bowser i think i know which one i d go to
when the guest stars overcome the story  there s a problem. also...where s your stuff  melonie ! lol
starting this week right with a jammin  new video from melonie! love it!  hope you had a blessed easter
jack black and lizzo felt like they were added into the episode as an mtv movie award skit
i didn t even know who she was at first  but the combo of her and jack black showing up in this show took me right out of it.
the mandalorian visits an opulent world. more like a corpulent world.
melonie always adds a bit of sunshine in our day! take care   be safe.
it seems like some sort of weird re-tread of the dwarf couple in rings of power
that s just lizzo  jack black and christopher lloyd having a conversation interrupting the mandalorian.but you re right this would have been a skit back in the day
yes the mandalorian started out similar to one of those old-time westerns where the lone gunfighter travels around helping people and killing bad guys.  and then we got brightly-colored floating vespa scooters.
she is no actress for sure.
6.8 is so generous. this episode was a 4.1 at best.
the mandalorian 1st and 2nd season feels like a classic japanese film the lone wolf and the cub. its why sw anime visions went back to the roots to revisit what made george lucas adapt japanese films to modern classics.
people is racist because the bad actress we hired is black!!
they don t want actually  or literally lol  strong women because those women can  gasp  think for themselves!
i d like to see the paycheck of din and katie  maybe disney believes in equal pay as well.
way to downplay a legendary and respected actor.
same
@liam phibian  he s saying loyd is a good actor.
jack blacks alright
@arnie  yeah i don t know what crap he said
right. or how jindaru  can t hardly swing the sword. like he s got a bad back or something. though like wokie  magic. the skinny little woman bokatan. uses it with ease. like she s had years of training. and is stronger than a guy twice her size.
@robint h-d.e.s  i heard part of the lore of the dark saber is  it is extremely heavy unless you know how to use it   the force must be with you or some trash like that .
@dand06  hmm  that sounds like more lore bending b.s to me. idk what s worse. no new starwars content. or this  they keep pushing out.
@dand06 it has to do with the amount of midi-cholera you have
@dand06  tbh that could be a cool concept like an excalibur or mulnier type deal if they played it up more and made it get heavier the more he tried to use it  because he isn t a member of the royal family or a chosen one to be on the throne or something  too bad they probably won t
actually  for a new hope  george lucas benefited from casting a trio of actors who brought their own sensibilities to their roles. in fact  harrison ford  mark hamill  and carrie fisher would joke to each other on-set about george s poor direction  which was nothing more than   do it faster. make it more intense   which is direction that has nothing to do with tone. this is why empire strikes back is the best of the original trilogy  because it was directed by irvin kershner  not george lucas. even the guy who voiced darth maul in the phantom menace spoke of george s poor direction when he said that the only direction he got from george concerning darth maul was   make him sound evil. but i agree that jar jar looks classy by comparison. that is undeniable.
@gabriel  good points  i agree.
@gabriel  when you watch the ot back-to-back  it really is shocking how much better the acting in empire strikes back is than it was in a new hope.
jar jar  meesa wuv yousas  for yousas bombad comment  deesa peepul make meesa better character than lizzo  meesa opinion sheesa look worse than gooberfish. lol
lol jack black has been nothing but cringeworthy in his old age.take me back to the pick of destiny era.
@dcmastermind first   .age does that to many people.start strong  .end off as fluff..
@the poetic butcher  he s like the most cringeworthy old man now.
come see the guest stars this week!  this show may as well be  the love boat .
thats why this whole scene felt annoyingly familiar  hot damn
there s a theory that the early episodes of the mandalorian were based on the boba fett movie that never got made  which would explain why there s a difference between early episodes and later episodes  similar to the difference between the episodes of game of thrones based on george r.r. martin s already published books and the episodes that were made following the point at which the books had left off.
she is a professional victim though  requires a small amount of acting capabilities.
she identifies as one
i m just thankful they got her to wear clothes
jack black played jack black in the episode... so.
really like what you ve done with that room. the decor is outstanding
yes that was super cringe. and to do that to jack black and christopher lloyd. granted they singed on to do it  but still. and lizzo  my goodness. your video is great melonie. but the mandalorian  sheesh! and i liked the first two seasons. i hope you have a really day melone!  take care
not getting back into the star wars shows lol  too hard to watch. glad to see you still doing well  i hope you had a great easter sunday! god bless you and have an amazing day!
it seems like favarau is demoralized. like he lost some internal battle at lucasfilm. they announced they re ending the filoni verse in a movie  so maybe that s connected.
in her defense  i feel like this is one of those things where every week will see a drop in score  but i was watching the ep with my husband and yeah she can t act
yeah  i checked out after gina got fired  but they literally jumped the shark or  more accurately  jumped the baby mandalorian.
it sure is stunning and brave to bring pizza the hut into the star wars universe.
melonie  the national geo dinosaur show was quite cool! i was nearly led into thinking the team was a dissecting a real t rex! how much it cost to construct that life like monster  god only knows.
i actually have an idea for a star wars story that circles around a female rattataki and a droid who end up landing on undiscovered planet  whilst escaping the clutches of a nautolan bounty hunter. they end up discovering a new race that had lived on the planet long ago  and they end up meeting others who have prices on their heads. they must work together to evade the hunters that are after them and survive the planet s harsh conditions.
the bad batch  an awesome animated show about family and the rise of the empire  is the only star wars thing i care about right now. it s actually being done well where nothing else is
good to see that boss nass from the prequels is still alive in disney continuity
christopher lloyd looks like he is really trying to hold it together. when i saw him at ny comic con in october he looked barely together on stage. i know old age will get the best of all one day but damn.
i m sorry  did i just read that right   the mandolorian now has lizzo in it ! i also haven t watched season 3   but what the actual f are they thinking !   how are the stock holders okay with this !
it s cool to see christopher lloyd in something star wars. i kind of wish he could be in an entire series. as far as i m concerned there s no season 3.
i remember when being overweight was seen as unattractive. as it represented gluttony  lack of discipline  and usually poor hygiene and self care
the  guns for hire  episode was weird.season 1 was the best season. they had a great formula. grogu was cute at first  but i feel is holding din back at this point. his bounty-hunting episodes were my favorite to want.
i actually liked this episode mando made a good showing it set up the next episode well and i am a sucker for droids.it actually was a good episode.
don t worry guys ... he ll just get back in his time machine  and start again. when he comes  back to the future!   this whole episode will have never happened.
withou tat doubt the lizzo   jack black cameos were stunt casting choices to get people talking. overall this was the first episode this season that was  truly filler. and while this is the worst episode of the season and series... season 3 has been a banger thus far. them shifting focus to bo-katan was done because initially the din djarin story was wrapped up after season 2. initially they had no plans to go further than that with him and grogu. but money talks and kathy kennedy wanted more. so this is what we have gotten. its still good. and wasn t a m-she-u type of decision... bo-katan has a story that needs completed and being she is a mandalorian it fits in with a show titled the mandalorian.
wow  that despicable woman can sink anything.
yes it was ok.
exactly i don t get what the problem was.. it was a fine episode the set up the next perfectly  lizzo and jack black didn t even do anything noteworthy in the episode. and as far as bokatan goes she was always mean to be the leader she was the last guys daughter so this is something that s been foreshadowed since we first met her.
it s the weight issue!not enough buoyancy!
literally and figuratively
wow!so cruel.
i know right  look at the titanic. iceberg my ass.
this looks like a star trek tng episode. the period in tng where the writers went on strike.
bad on purpose  seems to be the new thing certain online streaming services seem to be experimenting with.  this really comes across as  bad on purpose.
the auralnauts  spoof of the mandalorian is better than any actual mandalorian episode.
star wars western  !! that is a great description. i agreed. that was what i liked so much of the first season.
the only thing that episode lacked was mando jumping a shark on water skis.
the scenes with jack black and lizzo looked more like something from a spaceballs movie.
good morning  melonie! love to start the week with a new video i actually just saw that shirt on sale.
the show literally jumped the shark by jumping the grogu... i call it the erkel effect cuz i liked watching family matters when erkel was a side character that occassionally showed up and got some laughs so the showrunners seemed to think that if audiences like a little bit of erkel they will really love a lot of erkel... no  no we didn t the more he was featured the worse the show got.
imagine you take one key character played by gina carano out of the story ... that had strong story arks building the new season ... imagine no longer ...
i m tempted to start watching this season to see what im missing!
i m hear jack black was thrilled with this episode. it s the one time he wasn t the fattest person on set.
i thought aside from the aggressive cameos  the episode itself was pretty solid.
lizzo is the bud light of actresses
doesn t bo katan having the darksaber defeat the purpose of the mythosaur
i m suprised she was actually wearing clothes and didn t have a twerkout with jack black while grogu watches while eating popcorn
miss the days when star wars  and movies in general  were about telling a story  not about checking boxes.
honestly she wasn t bad and the episode was good. i don t care for her but did her job. plus jack black is there and he s always a plus one.
it s really weird that din djarin does all the real work  but only bo katan gets all the credit for it...
instant stop of the season for me as soon as i heard lizzo was going to appear in a episode.
i m enjoying these new episodes  i guess i m the only one. and in  guns for hire  katee sackhoff was giving me serious  deputy moretti  vibes.
i think the idea is that it s much easier  and less costly  to hire writers and directors who really don t know how to make a high quality production but can still attract viewers by making something so bad that people have to watch it just to see if it s really that bad. it s the reason drivers slow down and stare at the aftermath of a car accident  to see how bad it was.
they want to be able to ush their far left or feminist or woke or whatever politics and agendas in peace  without anyone criticizing them.
i actually have that shirt
don t!
except the motivation of christopher lloyd s character made zero sense. what was his goal in causing the droids to go crazy  he was a seperarist  okay  he s living on a planet that is an independent world beholden to no larger galactic government. he values democracy above all else  okay  he lives on a planet whose system of government is a direct democracy and they are absolutely dedicated to this ideal. based on what he was ranting about he s already living in what he should consider to be a paradise.
who
if you want to kill a franchise just add a bunch of immersion breaking celebrity guest appearances. simpsons i m looking at you too.
the sad part is that the general story is workable but their execution has been a series of disasters.   all of disney is in total chaos and it shows.
lizzo should have played jabba s wife.
this is about as funny as when they made stacy abrams the president of earth in star trek discovery. lol
panderlorian had potential
sleazo performed an amazing rendition of a space whale.
not the worst episode  that still belongs to the season one prison break episode.
on the bright side  at least she has more clothes on that she usually does.
when the worst episode is the one with cameo  you can for sure know that the writers and producers don t know what they are doing.
it s sad to see great product get destroyed
they showed us that the hutt family still lives.
i m gonna be slightly contrarian on this and say i don t think having lizzo and jack black in this episode was bad. in fact  given the context of the entire episode  i d say the way they played the characters  the snl vibe of things  is rather fitting. spoilers for the episode below see  the planet is one where all manual labor is done by droids. it s basically supposed to be a  paradise  where people can do only the things they want  because menial tasks are handled for them. they even go so far as to say that if the droid workforce were to be taken away  their society would collapse. and so to see lizzo and jack black playing cartoonish caricatures of royalty makes sense as a commentary on how such a society would devolve. this sort of story could really go off the rails and the society could be trash  but it s kind of an ideal turn of events for them since they don t really have many problems. even so  they come out looking cartoonish. they aren t bad people  they are just deprived of work and the growth associated with it  and so are kind of these dilettantes  playing at governing more than actually doing it. because it s also clear  at least to me  that if they had spent any effort to investigate their problem  rather than hiring din and bo-katan  they would have solved this for themselves. it wasn t a deep dark mystery that only these two could have solved. it just took a little effort  but that was too much for them. it s not the best episode  i ll certainly grant that. but i think there s a lot more substance to it than  ah! lizzo playing space croquet! jumping grogu! bad!
when i heard lizzo was in star wars  i just assumed she was gonna be jabba s kid or something.
the mandalorians in these shows just look like cheap cosplayers  not killers. look how jeremy bulloch portrayed boba fett in empire and jedi. you could tell he was dangerous just from his body language.
that scene really did look like it was from snl!
i have been watching the entire series. i think i am officially done after the last episode. the ending was absolutely terrible in my opinion
the mandalorian was a glimmer of hope...that s why kk reached out and crushed it.  hence  season 3 is sh t.
i was all set to work the production of s3 but then they had a vax mandate that i would not comply with. it seems that my medical health decision has been validated. i m glad that i did not work on this dumpster fire.
it was enough when she used grogu as a pet and he purred  _
you re right this really looks like snl
yes it does
i think sackoff being swapped as leader is more because pablo being a pain on set than the typical bait and switch.
whatever season 3 is  it s not the mandolorian. it s something completely different.
what angers me the most is that lizzo is not going anywhere. she is going to be in the show for the long run and jack black will go away at some point and then the main character will be replaced with the female mandalorian and then that will be the end of the show
judging by the opening clip  i d e say that lizzo was the least of this show s problems.
with christopher lloyd  jack black  and lizo this didn t seem like it fit with the rest of the episodes.  i recognize cl and jb but i had know idea who she was. i m old soooo. and remember to drink water.
i grew up with only the first three movies  so i m glad to have so much more star wars to watch. that being said  i have to admit that this episode was pretty campy.
i knew that mandalorian s success  would soon attract the jackals that have destroyed the other shows.
how can you say the costumes don t fit star wars  i can t imagine anything fitting in with the bobba fett vespas better
seeing this makes me glad i gave up on it and have no emotional connection to it anymore..
this is what happens when jabba the hutt gets equity treatment
grogu jumps like yoda  i don t have any issue with that.
yes  i heard about jack black being in an episode  but i didn t know that christopher lloyd was in it as well...and then there s....lizzo. lizzo is nothing more than flavor of the month fodder  she ll be forgotten about within 6 mos to a yr.
all i can think of is jabba eating that frog in rotj.
it s like they completely forgot what made the mandalorian great... season 1 was good  season 2 was decent  and now 3 is wtf
i m a big fan of jb. love tenacious d and his older movies  pick of destiny  school of rock . maybe it was just a dream of him to be in something star wars. thats what i like to think at least. which leads my to my question whats that lizzo thing
someone who hasnt seen the episode has no right criticising it. it was an okay episode
bart  this was the worst episode of the mandalorian.homer  the worst episode of the mandalorian so far.
jumping grogu reminded me of kermit the frog sword fighting in muppets treasure island. farce as drama. so sad.
hey i thought this episode s first 2 minutes and last 4 minutes was solid
kennedy looked at what they were doing to marvel and said   hold my beer.
where did you hear that he was a pain on set  i didn t know that
i saw episode 6 yesterday. the fake strong women characters  with men being dumbed down for them is just pathetic.the wild west vibes we had originally is almost entirely gone.not worth anyone s time. not a single remarkable moment.that  city planet  thing with jb and whatever her name is was one of the most stupid and irritating thing i have ever saw. a pathetic society that deserves to end...but then again a worst idiocy like the woke world some people are supporting irl still marching on...probably to a world full of slavery...i won t say anything more because it would involve really bad words and also might spoil for some people that still want to suffer and see through the conclusion.
jack black has become another actor that doesn t act anymore. he has a character  and he puts it in every role he gets. bad batch season two was much better than the mandalorian season three. they should have sent grogu off with luke and been done with him. everyone owns a grogu doll now  they re not buying anymore  and you can t do anything with him that doesn t look odd. when he moves  being an actual prop  that s what it looks like they re tossing around. it doesn t look good.
can i just get season three but only of grogu
andor is the best thing to happen in star wars since rogue one and the empire strikes back. character development and patience. stories and character beats that matter and are thoroughly believable.
i assumed that  she would be  playing a young jabba the hut
i die a bit inside each time i see what disney and the cult have done to star wars. but i m also becoming more apathetic to it too. one day i ll laugh at its death.
i would respect disney if they actually just came out and said  we re a leftist company catering to leftist ideologues. or ip s are fully immersed in the culture wars and we have a very clear side. if you re on the other side or even if you want to ignore the struggle  you re not one of us and this product isn t for you .i would legitimately respect than and quietly move on.
when i had seen lizzo i thought they brought back jabba the hutt.
after some plot happened  there is no longer any need for din djarin to be in the series. its like how john snow became an object to just have in an episode.  no meaningful dialogue or thoughts.  just  yes  milady .
so they went and recast the death star
the 1st season was great  the second worked then gina got canned now its just a mess
great scott!!!they brought my boy doc brown down to a deplorable level!it s time for us to go back!
when i first saw a clip of this i really thought it was a parody
to talk this way about bo katan. i get the feeling you didnt see clone wars or rebels  as her story is continuing from there. as sister of duchess satine kryze lover of obiwan kenobi. fought with ashoka tano to capture maul  the whole story with sabine wren and her mother against galen erso  her time in death watch and so many story points.and besides din jarrin was just the catalyst for the story of post imperial mandalore. it is really about the mandalorians which has a long history 1000s and 1000s year old  heck the clones are from a mandalorian  you have old republic jedi sith like revan  you have the whole history of the dark saber with house visla  mandalore the great.
disney ruined all my childhood favorites. awesome shirt  tho.
andor is currently the best disney era star wars we ve gotten since rogue one.
din  jer  is just bo katan s bodyguard.  this season should of been called  bo katan  and i wouldn t have any problem with it.the fact its still called the mandalorian and its not about him is an insult.
i don t mind jack black being on the mandalorian.
mandalorian has been good this season. i ll admit this episode was a little strange but if was animated like in clone wars or rebels it wouldn t have stood out as much. they re setting up for ahsoka which is a sequel to rebels. what concerns me is the stuff kathleen kennedy touches. andor wasnt to bad either so far aside from the new movies star wars hasnt been that bad. the book of fett was decent but not the best it had its moments.
am struggling to find good entertainment right now  how long will this go on
side note they re on a planet thats extremely lavish and over the the top for context.
i should have stopped watching the mandalorian when they disrespected and fired gina carano but now... after lizzo the hutt i m done! that human bean bag can not act what so ever  they could have tempted it with a whole truck of hostess snack cakes and that toxic turd still couldn t act. i like jack black but his character was completely ignorant as for lloyd   that guy is awesome but he s to old to be acting  he could barley speak his lines without shivering. it s a shame because the show started out really well. great vid btw.
its alright  i ve been slugging through  the episodes  some have been just ok  this one was a trainwreck. as much as i love jack black  he didn t need to be in this episode  and i had no idea who lizzo is until i asked someone. not curious enough to find out more than the bare minimum. the episode goes nowhere  you can literally see jon favreau s thought process on screen  where he s like  let s copy risa from star trek  and give them a tech problem.  then watch as jon searches for a villain to the episode as he writes  and its like cw disney channels of writing. so i could tell who the  villain  of the story was early on and it was awful.
oh lizzo  i guess i made the right choice waiting to see if its good or not
happy  belated now  easter  melonie! he has risen! hallelujah!  and  yeah  sw is dead in all but name only. what we re watching these days is just a woke zombie draped in a poorly made sw halloween costume. the only merciful thing to do would be to put it out of our misery by not feeding it any more money.
thought it was pretty brave of them to race swap jabba lol
they re trying to court normies that don t like star wars. meanwhile  they are alienating actual long-time fans of the franchise.
i am sorry i have to totally disagree with your assessment. it was not the best episode of the mandalorian but it was not the worst.but a lot of shows have this issue when they have cameos by famous personalities  some people get taken out of the moment.
do you ever post good news
they gave a scene showing a butch looking girl betraying a character. it was a full 20 minutes that had nothing to do with mandalorian. it was just airtime to inject their wokeness. that was an additional final nail in the coffin for me.
ugly people always have to justify themselves to other people. and i mean both physically and or personality-wise. and in lizzos case...both.
i m pretty much done with supporting any media that comes from hollywood  in other words  major woke studios  these days. there are plenty of other ways to spend my time like playing indy games  spending time outside  and reading. i absolutely loved the mandalorian seasons 1 and 2 but after gina carano and now this stuff i just can t bring myself to watch it...
to this day i don t even know why lizzo is famous  let alone why she s getting even more so.
i never knew who was lizzo was until someone told me to search   lizzo flute  ...
they were trying to make this planet seem like a bunch of fat  soft  helpless people. they did great.
don t make jabba the hutt joke don t make jabba the hutt joke don t make jabba the hutt joke
on the bright side  lizzo was a disgusting  corrupt  awful person who was used as an example how bad the new republic is. its actually a pretty good episode overall  which a great return of battle droids and more world building for what droids do when they aren t fighting  but i think some people mistook lizzo s character for being a good person. she isn t.
andor has been the best thing that has come from disney so far in my opinion
so jack black and the professor from back to the future are in this episode
lizzo should have be called ds3 in mandolorian  death star3   she is a size of it
the third person in the clip is  doc brown  christopher lloyd. did no one recognise him
wow.!that s so cruel.
that s it  i am funding a star crash reboot or sequel to give the fans their star wars cravings not satisfied by this!  i hope david hasselhoff is still around and available
jon probably thinking  kennedy is just gonna try and sabatoge any efforts to make a good series. however  i might get her out of here faster if the show tanks.....
this is the kind of thing that makes you hate celebrities
honestly  episode 3 was the best episode of the entire series for me. it had better world-building and premise that it also seemed like it didn t belong. i was more interested in ex-imperial officers and soldiers dealing with living in a new republic regime than anything mando has ever had going on  aside the times where he actually did bounty hunting . that episode just reminded me of how good andor was by leagues of anything disney star wars has made. it actually had stakes  the empire was intimidating and competent  cassian was wooden but could actually be sympathized with  andy serkis actually was allowed to act and not have decent material to work with  there was nuance with the empire and republic too  not just empire bad and republic rebels good.
it was like sw meets scooby doo.
how do any of these episodes have similar ratings to the godfather movies  you re not looking at the right thing...who cares if it s the lowest...its still too high!
i hate completely superfluous cameos in star wars.  it s one of those things for shallow fans to just go  omg it s that one guy from that other thing i know omg
lizzo  the first hoc... hutt of color.
that sucks cuz bryce has been the best director of the series and now her episode is worse than the one earlier in the season that barely had mando
i didn t see this episode. did lizzo play a planet
it s just as cringe to have jack and christopher as it is to have lizzo. lost any minuscule amount of respect i had for jack.
i rejected disney as a whole the instant i saw the last jedi and found out they abandoned the extended universe. disney is dead to me now. dreamworks  for now  is killing it.
honestly animation star wars snd maybe ahsoka   v slightly   is the only thing keeping it alive i want acolyte to be good because this is the korean actors first non korean show
looks like someone  jon favreau   owes lizzo some favors huh
omg. never heard of lizzo before. how many grogus did she eat
i agree that this episode was a farce having those two in it but i disagree that the show is bad.  personally i think jon favreau has done a fantastic job overall with the show.
it s really shocking and disheartening to think about what star wars has become. i saw the force awakens in the theater for times  and watched it at least another seven or eight on blu-ray. at this point  i couldn t care less about how much of anything that lucasfilm is putting out. everything star wars sucks  i made it 15 minutes into the first willow episode  indiana jones is looking like it s going to suck. none of it is taken seriously.
gina carano is too good for disney.
the only sense of hope at this point for the star wars franchise is jedi survivor on the 28th.
the best scene of jack black ever on film is when bruce willis blew him to bits with a 50 caliber gun in the jackal
.you must be practicing your comedy writing..
oh jeeze. you really had to reach for all that dude lol.
@livvvid  not really when the bar is set so low.
@the poetic butcher  whys that  what do you have to add
@r.e.z      why s that sounds like you can stop there
@the poetic butcher  again  what do you have to add  or are you just barking to disagree with the wall  i mean thats fine if thats all your doing  twitter people do it all the time.
the first time i ever saw  lizzo  or even heard of her... they gave her that 100 year old priceless presidents flute just for her to twerk with it on stage.. i was like is this a mockery
isn t this the same thing they did to obi wan  just threw in a bad actress to play an out of place character just for woke points
the favreau filoniverse of star wars ended with luke skywalker slicing up some dark troopers.
shows been going downhill fast after the season 1 finale. i wish jack black had told them to  get that corn outta my face  when they showed him the script.you are very beautiful today  melonie
didn t think favreau was gonna go down this road.
i ve dumped all of these universes and all in on warhammer. can t wait for henry cavills show!!!
i understand why people don t like this  but tbh  i like it for one reason  it s jack black people  that man is a legend
no way the show actually needed them. they must have worked at low pay to be on the show
hey melonie! your back. you look beautiful melonie. i hope you enjoyed your easter weekend.
people are so fickle  cant have fun anymore
disney has turned the star wars series into a clogged prison toilet. you know how many of these new movies i m going to watch  none of them.
the only redeeming factor of the episode is christopher lloyd.
what kind of timeline crossover is this  just go with the flow
they actually put that piece of whale tallow in the mandalorian  glad i haven t bothered to watch since season 2.
it looks like an old star trek episode.
yeah i think lizzo demanded that she would be on the set. the show should just end now. great video melonie! you look amazing too!
jack black and christopher lloyd were good.... ish... lizzo took me completely out of it.
where is the lizzo fanbase star wars fanbase overlap  who is this cameo for  imagine if lil wayne showed up in house of dragons.
i m kinda behind on the channel  lore   but you seem to be filming in a cell.  hopefully  disney lucasfilm hasn t abducted you and ordered you to keep making videos  lol!
looks like someone has stolen all of melonie s stuff.
lol ouch.
jack black gave a better performance in the jumanji movies.
christopher loud  jack black  and lizzie were the worst actors in this episode. the way they talked seemed they were indeed doing a parody of star wars  like they couldn t take it seriously so they went as bombastic as they could. and there was no plot  spoiler loyds character is the twist villain who is making droids go haywire for no reason except that  i m a separatist . nice clone wars reference with no reason
i cant believe they changed the race of the death star....
being on the mandalorian wasn t the first time lizzo was in space. when she crashed on earth she separated south america and africa.
i feel bad for jack black...he must need the money.  he needs another  be kind rewind  to get his street cred back
i don t get the issue. i m enjoying s3 so far. eh
they should have made the prequels like this  darth vader flips because he realizes that the jedi are a bunch of self-righteous un elected twats that he thinks needs to go. darth is actually one of the good guys and obi wan and yoda fail to see their own zealous faults.
is lizzo s character a hutt
to be honest  this episode wasn t bad. it was a weaker episode in the series but i still enjoyed myself in the moment.
least she wasn t twerking.
as much as i love the clone wars  we need to come to an unfortunate conclusion. the clone wars series allowed the wokeness to take hold. it paved the way for once bad idea after another. overusing darth maul  turning grievous into a cowardly weakling  the addition of the inquistors  which i never cared for  rey skywoker and those garbage films  obi-wan kenobi that did not live up to the hype  book of boba flop  star wars visions which was the most incomprehensible idea i have ever seen. thanjs to the worst idea disney has ever had since they decided to milk the diseased and rabid cow that is live action remakes and that is disney plus. star wars is just not what it used to be anymore. i know i sound old fashioned. i m a lover of dvds and vhs tapes and the aughts era of gaming me  star wars  in my eyes lasted from 1977 beginning with the first film to 2008 culminating with the force unleashed.
what would happens if mcdonald s became all vegan and insulted all customers that complained about that burger king would make millions by just making their meat burgers!well  that s disney right now! they hate its consumers!nintendo will take its place  by making good and fun movies!i can t wait to see zelda  metroid and starfox movies announced soon.
make idiocracy fiction again
if lizzo came out into the show and went from 260lbs to 135lbs i would say good on you lizzo.
have you seen what they did to bud light  it s getting out of control.
i watched the episode  and saying it was cringeworthy when lizardo was on scene would be saying it mildly.the surrounding stuff was decent  stating this mildly   but not even the great jack black could save these scenes.if they had someone other than lizardo it could have been.  but of course  star wars has to promote this failure of a performer.
mando season one isn t rocket science.  somehow they managed to fail at following that formula and instead took writing cues from the worst game narratives of all time.
yeah that was bad...that s what i want... a bounty hunter western
lizzo could play a new planet that has been discovered.
melonie reminds me of shannan watts
planet phaturndum
wow!so cruel.
i don t agree mandolroian was ever good. it was just marginally better than all the other dross that came out at the time.
bringing in celebrities - bill burr was great  that worked well. lizzo   jack black did not - it took everyone right out of immersion in the story. they should have been aliens maybe.. christopher lloyd was criminally wasted in his role by poor scripts. this whole episode was almost unneccesary as bo katan should have got the darksaber on mandalore. definitely the worst episode yet.however  i have faith in the good intent of dave filoni   jon favreau. i hope the next episodes will improve on this. i do want to see more din djarin  especially being bad-ass but i am also loving the whole mandalorian back story and i am rooting for bo katan. mandalorians have lost their way  maybe din   bo will help them find it again.  mandalore - a new hope
she ate the ratings...  and probably baby yoda
money on the table  din dies at the end of the season.  firing pedro pascal wouldn t have been a hard sell to favreau.if he fought it  it was a fight he didn t want to win.
star wars died when bob iger and kathleen kennedy nuked the expanded universe in 2014.  and you can take that to the bank!
i felt like the episode turned into galactic law   order. if the episode didn t have lizzo  but kept the other guest stars  i d be ok with it.
the mandalorian always seemed like a bit of a cheap  cute-bombing  nostalgia attempts to get viewers. baby yoda is less cute than a baby or puppy  to me  and the show is basically a lot of different object exploration hunts. luckily i prefer different sci-fi subjects than star wars. i am a big fan of the star trek universe and shows like fringe. but i was never a fan of anything to do with star wars after the original movies.  the difference between the light and the dark side became needlessly more fuzzy to be able to accommodate less well written characters and their demons.
i thought it was a great episode.
the mandalorianess and her valet the mando pay a visit to the illustrious world of bowling ball people who are not funny.jack is incredibly funny in other works  or scary or creepy - when the role works. in this  it s just a waste of his talent. they re just driving the entire series into the ground now as well.i hate it. i watched up til ep5. i am not going to watch past it  i think. right now i definitely can t  i just find the episode offensive  it just breaks all immersion and enjoyment.
revenge of the gina lol
i don t understand the hate. star wars fans accepted jabba the hutt  why not lizzo in all honesty  the hypocrisy of them firing gina carrano over nothing and excusing worse from the cast s liberal morons  made me stop watching this show. let them drive it into the ground and destroy it like they do with everything else at disney.
why does everyone give christopher lloyd a pass  he s just as much cringe
as hudson would say  game over man! game over....
lmao the whole gina carano things makes me laugh. i love this channel but the people who complained about gina carano including you mel  really don t care about her. you liked this one character she did and then jumped on the hate train because she got held accountable for things she did which she knew could impact her job. it is what it is  we all know the risks and consequences of anything when we have a job. if y all cared as much as y all say y all do then go support other things she is doing. go watch her old movies. go buy a bunch of her old mma merch. people would still watch this show if it was good. gina carano is not a big movie star. we don t know her personally so we don t know how she is as a person. stop sucking the tit just because you wanna pick a side. it s weird tbh.
melonie when jack black is good he is good like in peter jackson s king kong
should of ended the show with luke taking the kiddo.
is that lizzo   redacted   redacted   redacted !
poor christopher lloyd. he looks genuinely ashamed there  didn t even have to act!
they shoehorned that crappy little green frog back into the story to milk the plushie sales. if they left it out the mandalorian could be back on track doing bounties or anything other than this
maybe we re just not used to seeing her with a lot of clothing on and speaking normally.
doctor emmett brown
and still put the rest of the cast to shame.
i just refuse to give my money to a woke company. i can watch 14 reactors  each with a different edit  and watch the whole episode. besides adding politics to tv has always been a disaster. if it never works the why add it
well  that s no leia in a bikini or royal padme in the thumbnail ... but i m listening
looks like the unintentionally campy 1980s dune movie.
now now..let s not jump on lizzo that fast.keep in mind that we had no idea jabba the hut had a daughter. so she at least expanded the lore
and now rey is pregnant.
sir grogu did nothing in the whole episode. the mandalorian was a secondary character in his own show. the force is female is taking hold of this show.
they ve gone woke.  every woke program or movie has the lowest ratings.  when will they learn
and whys lizzo wearing mickeys ears on her hair
the great lizzo the hutt..
homer simpson voice   the worst episode so far
great  now the force has high cholesterol.
jack black made it much worse with her in that episode.glorification of obesity and interracial couples with  royalty . pascal has been replaced by a woman.
why keep trying to normalize a grossly obese woman  and no  i m not  fat-shaming   seeing that i m also overweight. but there s being overweight  being fat and being hideously fat and lizzo clearly belongs in the last category  personal opinion . being that fat simply isn t healthy  no matter how much they try to make you believe it is healthy.
2 30
it was cool to see jack black. not so much lizzo.
lizzo ate star wars
i don t know what people are talking about. from 1977 to 1983  star wars was a great ride. now people sound as if star wars was done recently  but i know that s not true. just putting on a helmet doesn t make something star wars.
hi melonie thoughts on mario 1993 movie being so bad it s good
the quality is really missing in season 3 .
oh  she expanded something all right...
i mean one good thing out of this. i see most shows shy away from having a black woman be in love with a white man. i remember stuff like true blood where they would show everything white on white but then cut scenes if it was a white man black woman dynamic. they did this in doctor who  and countless other shows like if it was a black man and a white woman it was fine but the other way around had to be cut up and off screen. i know i m getting off track here but it was nice to see even if in a woke setting a black woman going  then we fell in love mwah mwah   and all this coming after me watching a video on the dnd mixed race thing.... anyway my point is this didn t hit me as hard because of that xd
yea disney s getting hit hard now  with the super mario bros movie out doing some of disney s best work. shame disney s had to take down star wars. i use to really like star wars.
love your shirt btw
how dare you compare this to andor lmaoo
it s not review bombing  it s feedback.
my eyes!!! they are burning!!!! well it could be allergies but my eyes! nope not allergies lol hope you had a great day yesterday miss or mrs melonie the cis gendered woman. much love with terrible grammar
and some people actually think this episode was good.
is that christopher lloyd
what s funny is they will take its failure as star wars has lost its intrigue. it won t be anything they ve done   it s the consumer.
is this episode about the hutts
disney plus subscription ran out and i m not renewing. it s so bad mandalorian was the only good thing now it sucks.
if she ruins ashoka  i m definitely done with star wars.
thank the maker i haven t suffered a single episode  and star wars is dead for as long as the enemies of the fandom draw breath.
that is not fester! he s an impostore!!!
i can t agree with 99  of what disney has done but let s not go around acting like andor wasn t the greatest piece of star wars media we have gotten during the last 15 years give or take a few
lizzo destroyed alderaan
melanie get back on tnme!
it s been dead since disney bought it for me.
star wars is now a dumped snl parody of spaceballs
why are you commenting on a series you refuse to watch
melonie how was your easter
what happened to the background  what happen to your arms  are you okay  bless you.
so that s what a hutt with clothes on looks like....
doc brown ftw
like nerdrotic said  star wars is dead   firekathleenkennedy
your green screen is turned off. all i see is an empty room. or is that your green screen showing and empty room
all i got to say is season 3 of mandalorian as well as the sequel trilogy need to be cut from the canon
it seemed  fun  but i honestly do believe it was not needed. a real time unnecessary filler episode. and the cringe  all i saw was the image and i got that case. had to triple look to notice jack black.
at least super mario bros was pretty good.
korea and japan are replacing hollywood. thank goodness.
my 9 year old turned the episode off  said it s poop. lol
and i thought the power ranger wannabees was as bad as they would get. once again  they prove me wrong. can t wait to see how they ll go even lower.
andor is pretty good tho
you had the starwars franchise and screwed it up. starwars. oh  the possibilities but these people are not starwars fans or decent writers. these people insane.
what s the song at the end  lol
what were they thinking
can t be said enough  disney wars is not  has never been and will never be star wars. star wars is made to entertain people. disney wars is a real war fought againt people not see the world like kathleen kennedy.
im not surprised. its clear s3 is such a downgrade compared to the last 2 seasons. these episodes are far too short. and with only 8 episodes it just isn t right. id rather have 8 or 9 episodes with proper 45min length than this bs! like really  the shortest episode was 25min not counting credits. thats pathetic.also with all this talk about cloning in both mando and bb  if anything gives me sequel vibes or sets up anything for those garbage films  im dropping both shows entirely!! they are walking on a very fine line here. i really hate how bo was allowed to remove her helmet too. i know why they did it. but given what dinn went through just to redeem himself  then to have bo be allowed to take hers off only just after being recruited into their gang   no. that just doesn t feel right to me.
the acting was terrible but she did at least look like she lived an opulent lifestyle  gaudy jewelry and massively overweight.
it look like modern star trek.
most of this season has been filler and awkwardly jammed in place at that.
how is my baby doing
cool shirt
commenting to feed the algorithm
chrispher loyde was a perfect get for star wars. but lizzo....she s not an actor. or even has the ability to act. they should have made her a singer in the show. if they wanted her in it.
indeed it was cool at begning
is anybody watching season three
glad i m skipping the mandalorian
its star woke not wars
fear the walking dead is coming soon
i stopped watching this crap as soon as i heard they fired gina for not being woke.
that s no moon
disney star wars is at it again. that s a failure  very sad.
dang.
it s sad to see doc brown   christopher lloyd in this atrocious scene.......
welcome to more disney galactik star trash woke the not to be trusted joke and of course go broke
i still like andor series and video games about cal kestis. but mandalorian is becoming a joke now and seems to be completely lacking direction.
boycottdisney can we stop reviewing and talking about star wars and marvel we keep giving these things attention but if we just let them die off alone in the corner they will go away faster
say you hate big loud famous black women without saying you hate big loud famous black women
this is what they call  star wars   i checked out after after tlj.
lizzy the hut lol
ridiculous.  babylon bee had the best coverage of this farce  lizzo tries to eat baby yoda.
i like starbuck better than pedro at least
huge original starwars fan   but new sw sucks.  i watched that one newer movie where the girl beats everybody up rey i think.  haven t watched anything since.i dont buy sw merch for myself or my kid. disney   i grew up on sw. now i hate it. you lost a potential lifelong customer and a new generation of customers in my child.talk about killing the golden goose
did you get robbed or something
the parks are making huge money  people need to stop going the the stupid parks and disney would be done

season 3 as a whole has been pretty trash
it makes me so sad. i love jack black and christopher lloyd  but this is-bad.
question melonie
for me mandolorian isn t a woke serie
the simpalorian
you new studio sucks. at least buy a poster or something!  bbut the foreground is gorgeous as always.
the blandalorian has been boring from the start.  i couldn t force myself to watch this season.
i wasn t hating season 3  wasn t loving it  but i was enduring it in hopes it would come around. this episode was the worst  pointless  garbage ever. it made no sense and seemed like a trendy side project to make fringe people excited. i can t watch anymore.
star wars has been bad since the force awakens  solo and rogue one wasn t that bad
the other person talking to you is christian
reeeeee reeeeeeeeeee star wars is as good as ever!!!!!! lizzo is a stunning brave wahman of color! how dare you criticize her!!
comment for the algorithm
starwars is dead people... the era of kennedy marches on... she should be fighting for the women getting their skulls crushed by men pretending to be women in women s sports. she would be quite a voice for them.
lizzo the hutt.
what a shame!!! it s a bad joke  a disgusting and disturbing circus.
this new star wars and star trek woke garbage makes me glad there s no new stargate.
what useless cameos. at least  christian slater s star trek vi cameo was less invasive.message to celebs   stay a fan by staying out of it.
lizzo is no actress but she is a music artist that makes music and sings and plus her music is awful and terrible. also having jack black and christopher lloyd in the show series with lizzo was a big mistake and they should never ever done that ever. anyway i do hope that they will not do any other episodes with any other music artists and a movie actors who will be in the next episodes series of the mandalorian. anyway i just wanted to make a comment about this topic of the video for today  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great weekend with your family and i hope you had a great safe trip back home yesterday. anyway i hope you had a great day today and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
every word jack b says sounds troll. he s not a good fit for sw.
star wars is dead... we need something new to bring it back to life.even the star wars celebration wasn t hype enough...
it s turned into a sitcom. a friggin circus. cheesy  cheap and absolutely woke. looks like kathleen kennedy s vision is to make every single star wars show woke. star wars is crashing... hard.
unironically not even worth torrenting this dumpster fire. free is too expensive.
i wholeheartedly disagree you
wow  that was bad.
star wars is officially dead. the empire  disney  won after all. anakin s sacrifice meant nothing and rey sucks.
what s wrong with jumping grogu  we ve seen yoda jump around in his fight in the movies. they never said grogu was confined to the chair and couldn t move people are just nick picking shit for no reason. i guess the gina shit really pissed people off because the reasons people don t like season 3 don t make sense and has no merit if you actually watched this season.
i m surprised they haven t claimed racism yet. lizzo is a terrible actress. jack black was distracting. they should have gotten two no names to play the parts. it would have been better.
thats so bad...
first hi melonie
it looks so fake it doesn t look like none of the actors are really there
bruh  they only appeared for 5 minutes.getting tired of saying this.also  everyone seems to forget about the episode before where the mandos were fighting pirates. haven t heard a single peep about it.it s almost like they re doing selective outrage. and making mountains out of molehills
what about christopher lloyd  why did he get a pass from everyone
@another  i didn t find him distracting  like i did the others. i ve always kinda enjoyed him in films.
feel free to not say it. no one is gonna lose any sleep over it.
5 minutes is long time for a 30 minute episode.
