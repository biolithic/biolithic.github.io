she deserves criticism  just not any bullying.part of the blame has to go to the casting director. if that s how you sound final product  then that is the audition that you gave them and if that is likely the case  she should have never been given the role. seeing that this is a very popular game  she would have been crazy not to audition but she should have at least studied the character when her agent sent her the files.voice acting is a skill. expressing emotion is hard and not everyone can sound seductive. maybe in her mind that is what seductive sounded like  but i got to say it didn t work for me.there are a few people at fault  not just the actress.
the voice actress for ada did such a great job in resident evil 2 remake why couldn t they just keep it consistent !
you re exactly right  they should be bringing the criticism either to the producers  the director  or the casting studio. the media is doing what they do best  making a mountain out of an ant hill.
her delivery was very stagnate to me i was surprised how bad it was. would never harrash her over it though.
it s not her fault i m sure she did her best. the fact capcom felt they needed to drop the previous va because of her skin color is the real problem.
the thing is that her voice acting was approved by production its their fault if they didn t make any change so all those criticism should just be redirected to capcom like you said
they knew how beloved this game is. they knew it would go under a microscope! i remember my first reaction hearing gao and i was shocked at how different ada sounds. its like they hired david spade to do leon s voice
there was a attempt. i think if they gave lily gao lessons from a trained voice actor it might improve. this also just goes to show that just someone shouldn t be casted for their physical characteristics for voice acting. phil lamar is the voice actor for samurai jack. he got the role because he was the best fit for who auditioned during the time.
a solid and unbiased review from someone who understands the source material  thanks for the coverage!
to me  personally  lily gao s ada sounds like she s ada from 40 years in the future... after very tiring life...
i like how johnny yong bosch handled criticism for his broly voiceover. i once saw somebody bash his work  and instead of being bitter he just replied   send me a dm and tell what you don t like and i ll try to work on that.
if ever there was an argument that  looking like the character  does not matter when it comes to  voice acting   this is it.
there was no reason to remove the voice actress from the re 2 remake  except she was the wrong race. but the real problem is that lily gao is an actress not a voice actress. moving straight from that to voicing a video game where usually only a script is available with nothing to watch was a bad idea.
i think she was cast in that roll because she was also ada wong in newest live action resident evil movie. a lot of game studios don t seem to get that a movie actor doesn t always do well voice acting.
for me it s the  oh leon  . comparing that line in the re2 remake and then the re4 remake there s definitely a difference.
never blame an actor  it s up the chain that needs the blame.casting  director  producer are the people to look at  they chose direct the talent. they also had the option to re cast if the actor did not work how they wanted  the voice used is there vision  be it good or bad it s what they want .but as an actor your putting your self out in a public way  you get the highs of a good role and lows of a bad role. keep in mind you by having public social media your pushing your self out even more to the public.
it wasn t awful  but the difference was most noticeable! i personally forgot about the difference as i progressed through the game
a primary example why you hire someone who has talent and not based on diversity.
im glad others noticed  i got the game day 1 and when i got to the ada scene it took me completely out of the moment and game  i was like wtf is going on  i just kept playing but im glad others felt the same way lol  it was really really bad  i would have prefered the re2 remake voice personally. i thought it was good and that it would have been easy to hire here to reprise her role as ada.
i honestly believe she deserves the criticism. it will make capcom aware and maybe they won t cast ppl based solely on their race
the posts melanie read weren t bullying though but personal opinions. harsh opinions  but that s inherent to social media. the problem is that so many people open themselves up on social media expecting nothing but praise and just can t handle criticism. if i do some voice acting and your opinion is that it s s     that s just your opinion. i can look back at the results and think  he she s right  that could have been better  or i can think  i don t hear the problem  so i ll ignore this opinion.  it s that simple. and if i don t want to hear negative critique  then i shouldn t have an account on social media.
she got paid to contribute to a product or service based on what the business creating the product or fulfilling the service wanted. the overall quality of what the product or service turned out to be will usually reflect on the business itself. she contributed her voice work to the character  she acted based on direction from the business  and got paid and signed off on for the work. the ada we got vocally was signed off on by representatives working for the localization  directed by them  and approved by them.all of this vitriol should go to capcom  not her. same goes for any actor who worked under a disney or marvel or lucasarts production. when they do well  it reflects the business s quality. when they don t  it reflects the business s quality.
@tj roelsma  i never said the post she read were bullying. i was speaking in general. for every reasonable post  there has to be some toxic one i m sure. i should have articulated that better.
@espion2kx  yeah  maybe i wasn t that clear as well. no problem  but i still think that if you open yourself on social media  you should grow a thick skin  as there will always be people who will use the foulest language against you if they don t like what you re doing. that being said  how many times haven t we heard that some  star  suspended or even deleted his her accounts because of hate-posts  yet no evidence of that could be found. sure  some posts were very mean and sometimes even insulting  like the ones melanie read  but that comes with social media  where you can post under aliases and thus can t be held accountable. here on youtube some people react very negatively to responses and or opinions and like many others i just deal with it. i m always willing to defend my opinion and if someone hiding behind an alias just keeps insulting me  i ll just ignore him her  that s all there is to it. this voice actress should have done the same and it would have blown over quickly  because all this is just the proverbial storm in a glass of water.
people are forgetting that capcom has been handing out esg crap since 2020. morrison dmc5 is an example of that score requirement.
@dean the laughing mann  yes and no. yes  capcom is ultimately responsible for the product  but that doesn t mean nobody can be called upon for his her performance. some people are very fanatic when it comes to originals and remakes and they will spew their ire safely hidden behind an alias. my personal rule of thumb is that i may respond to an alias  but i already know that probably won t have an effect  as someone who seriously wants to discuss something will use his her own name instead of an alias. ultimately it doesn t matter much to me what somebody else thinks of my opinion  because opinions are personal. critique based on arguments is always welcome  as it may change my perspective and may lead to adjust my opinion. things like name calling or hate-posts i can simply ignore. it frankly amazes me that actors actresses always seem to be  offended  by everything that doesn t outright praise them  as they should know better.
@tj roelsma  i ve come to believe that to be in the entertainment industry in that capacity  you have to have a level of narcissism in you. and there are some who have it really bad. i think that s part of the reason why some of them can never understand why people don t like them or their performance
she doesn t deserve criticism  nor any kind of bullying. she sounded fine to me  a popular game with average voice acting at best  im just being honest and i love re4.
@jeymez  everyone deserves criticism it s the only way we improve. you do realize that there s negative and positive criticism  right
good question.
she s older and they wanted to give her a different vibe  i think the new va sounds ok
@jes s rodr guez guerrero  for me she has the right tone of voice. her delivery just sucks.
that was jolene andersen  who voiced ada in the re2 remake  and she sounded perfect. whoever directed the re4 remake failed to bring her over to continue in that role.
@jes s rodr guez guerrero  it was because she was a union voice actor. they cost more. capcomn simply didnt want to pay more and went for the cheaper option
@milkandmagic  oh interesting  i didn t consider that. great point there. capcom probably should have made that expense because the game was always going to be incredibly successful.
that is what i was expecting. not a bad va  that i dare say now that a female text-to-speech would be an improvement.
@espion2kx  many modern  actors actresses  have been raised with the idea that they re the best in everything.the problem with that is that when you ve always been praised and told you re amazing  you can t handle even the mildest form of critique. this is why all critical comments on movies are immediately called hate-posts  misogynistic  racist etc. even if you just mention that you liked the movie but you thought the lighting was bad  because much of the movie was way too dark  that s immediately being called a hate-post  as you re not allowed to criticize them. in my opinion this goes even further than just narcissism  as many narcissists simply don t care what others think of them as they see others as irrelevant. but when you ve always been praised on how amazing and special you are and then you have to face the cruel reality that you really aren t anyone special  that s a hard pill to swallow.
right  all that is correct imo.  criticism is a fine line that many just don t know how to do  or care to. in my experience  you lead with calling it  feedback  and maintaining that theme  but it can get pretty critical if needed.
no she doesn t. if you didn t like the voice  complain to capcom.
@mike d  fair enough. like instead of saying  contract  you say  written agreement . wording is important. i still believe that even the most negatively delivered comment can provide much-needed information to improve oneself. you don t control how information is given to you  but you are in control of how you process it.
@arkham asylum  why do you feel like she doesn t deserve any feedback
what bullying
@espion2kx  no your wrong  critiquing is not the same as criticism. another word you could use would be analize  but criticism is more like taking a shot at them. yes we have a difference in opinion on how one person s voice can sound to another  but people shouldn t even be going onto her social media page. she s just paid to do a job  so if people don t like how she sounds  go to capcom  you never go to the talent. because there the one s who gave her the job  just like the new ashley same difference.
@jeymez  first of all  there is such a thing as constructive criticism  meaning that even if you don t like what is being said there is still wisdom in what is being said to you. and you don t get to tell me what to do. and you can also be negative in your analyzing of someone s work to the point where it is negative or even toxic  so you changing up the words in the end mean absolutely nothing.secondly  at what point did i say that it was okay for them to go on to her twitter and bully her  you might want to learn reading comprehension before you start making these essays.did you even read what i wrote  if there is blame it starts with the casting director and works its way down the chain.all i said is that i did not like her performance and i have a right to express that. just because you don t agree doesn t mean that i am wrong.
it s absolutely true  it s more the casting directors fault. it s not her fault if she can t pull off the ada voice  she s just a voice actor  ada is the creators fault
i agree. the voice work is terrible  but bullying is not acceptable.
@michael rick  exactly! casting director is the first hurdle of the selection process  so yes definitely has to take some of the blame. a voice actor can only do so much and they do what they can to get the job done  it doesn t mean it will has to be received positively.
the people who like the job she did deserve to not be bullied as well.  i like the job she did.  this is my favorite version of ada.  sorry guys.  it s true.
well said.
also this doesn t sound like her real voice  it clearly must be because of the voice director and his advice  she doesn t deserve all the hate  she was just doing her job...
@norman readdis  yea i was kinda annoyed with what they did with morrison  but tbh didn t care too much as he wasn t as important as the 3 descendants of sparda however with ada on the other hand she s a liter integral part of re4 and they just majorly dropped the ball with her voice acting especially for a remake that had potential  and don t even get me started on the mike tyson sounding krauser
@mfcypher  your favorite version of ada  damn  your standards are low.
@melodusdethicus  thanks!!  i will have even lower standards if she becomes a playable character lol!!  i don t get all this fuss over an npc who has less air time than luis.  but if you guys wanna complain about everything then go ahead  it s a free country.
@mfcypher  it s very simple  she s a beloved character that has now been undermined by a lackluster performance. go look at a scene comparison of the original re4 and this remake and it should become obvious how dogshit lily gao s performance is. people don t talk like that simply. it s like she s just reading the damn script aloud instead of acting.blame can also be laid at the studio for producing and shipping this  but gao is hardly free from blame. after all  she was the one who gave this monotone  bot delivery.
@melodusdethicus  i find it strange that not being able to play as this beloved character anymore is not a problem for you.  instead  your focus is on the voice acting.  sorry if i think your priorities are a little out of order.
i agree. critiques sometimes hurt but idk how you can give that little of a crap on your lines and still defend them and also whip out the ol racist fans card. i also think there s equal blame on her voice director or whoever was in charge of overseeing her recording because... the performance was egregious. it was bad. lol
@tj roelsma  i also agree mostly with you. absolutely there are  harsh  opinions which do push the bullying boundaries which everyone is far too comfortable being jerks on social media but ada is a beloved character and if the voice actor and director ok d this work then what do you expect  it was terrible. it really was.
i agree dude.
lesser known fact  most vas are not told what they re working on or given very vague direction in order to  protect from leaked info.  it s like they brought her in  told her  you re an asian lady in a video game  recorded each line once  and shoved her out the door so save money. if they wern t greedy with it and gave her time to redo lines with proper directing she it could have been great.
@scott ruppert
they can t even figure out what they want the characters to look like. . the only one somewhat consistent is leon. jill  chris  claire and also ada are almost unrecognizable between some of the games. it seems character consistency is just not their strong suit.
@ric  nah the most consistent character in the re franchise is definitely hunk
@milkandmagic  capcom has deep pockets.  it s because they went woke.
because she went union  and capcom doesn t want to work with union va  because you know  more expensive and more conditions.
@ric  jill definitely isn t consistent. her face has changed so many times throughout the years
it was ok still two first actress is the ideal.
because they are voice actors and easy to replace so the job goes to the lowest bidder.  people trying to break in to the industry  not saying gao is trying to break in  but in general  are usually willing to accept less.
@midnightsqueen94  is there screenshots of what was said to her
i could be wrong but i read that its something to do with hiring non union voice actors.
@arc game design  sucks. she should ve come back for re4 remake.
@midnightsqueen94  look at leon in re6
..and this is why  meritocracy is important for us as a species... not just getting roles because of skin colour  no matter how the woke folk try to posture
@milkandmagic  that s like using cheap oil on your bugatti. stupid decision by capcom!
saying your fly is open is not a bad thing   just trying to help - a example
mole hill
@boss ross  lol  i know.
@neo jade  is there screenshots of what was said to her
@ville   the easiest to find ones are those highlighted on the media sites and related posts
this
the thing is her voice breaks the consistency of the continuity since she s been in the 2nd game.
end of the day  capcom approved the final product.
@khatdubell like capcom approved morrison raceswap in dmc 5. hope people see it now.
@norman readdis  yea i was annoyed with morrison  but at least they didn t race swap dante or vergil
who was the previous va
i heard it was because jolene anderson was union  and they went with a non-union actress. also the same actress who played her in the wtrc movie.
what the hell
@v kay a white woman
dude it wasn t lmao stop spreading false info
the reason she was dropped was she was unionised
@ryang   0
@terry6024gxd capcom had been passing the inclusion memo since 2020. ingrid hannigan has became a poc. like morrison in dmc 5.
there is some truth to this but not entirely. many roles are being filled by the race the character presents a lot more lately. while this is great at face value  it also means that if you aren t the race presented then do not apply  which is pretty racist. agencies do this because they don t want to be accused of being racist  but it s the same thing anyway. imagine you re a black voice actor and you re not able to audition for an asian presenting character because of your skin tone. and think of the opposite to be true as well. it s pretty much what i would call  stay in your lane  auditions. can t step on anyone s toes if no one s taking poc rolls from poc actors.but i don t think that they removed her because she was white.
doing her best was beside the point. she didn t have the voice for ada. she never should ve been hired.
@norman readdis  so  most of you didn t watch the dmc anime and the ones that did bitched about it.
the previous voice actor retired
crapcom destroyed the franchise with the original re4  this is karma
@john bishop i watch dmc anime literally in wowow channel back in cable days. that s morrison s first appearance.
@gloria thomas  how long ago was that
it was most likely because they wanted more money and lily gao already worked for them on that shitty netflix show.
has nothing to do with that  the voice actor for the old ada was not modeled after her. it was actually a half korean girl who modeled her  but the person who voiced ada was white. so when capcom decided to remake re4  they wanted to change a few things  ada s voice matching her asian background was one of them. so skin color wasn t the issue  it was the previous voice actor.
@espion2kx it s cause she s white. fact.
@jeymez   they fired a white woman because they wanted only asians to do asian  ada is half white btw  voices. this has nothing to do with  skin color   race
@norman readdis  ingrid has always been a person of color  this is as stupid as when people got pissed that ada wong was  suddenly asian  in re2 remake.
that s not why they dropped jolene. they dropped her because she went union.
@jeymez  no. jolene would have been cast again had she not gone union.
@norman readdis  lol what  ingrid has always been a poc.
@soapbubble  if you re talking about caucasian brunette as a  person of colour  yes. she was initially model to a caucasian woman in it s first face model tech implementation in damnation. they just do the slam dunk of culturally appropriating her because she has tan because we know twitter will cry ifnthey casted the og va nowadays. if  poc  demands the exclusivity of braids  for equality sake i want to make ingrid hunnigan name as an exclusivity to scandinavia and irish.hello ada wong is asian hence the name wong. lolalso jolene is also ingrid and ada in damnation. va  mocap and face model.
that s not the reason... doing even just a little research would tell you it s union related.
@norman readdis  at best her race is ambiguous. to me i always thought she was mixed race when looking at her appearance in og re4. i couldn t give a shit about damnation as that isn t her first appearance in re media  not to mention she looks very different in that game. also  devs have said jill is  half japanese  in the past even though she never appeared as such  so race in re isn t reliable anyway. like i said  she can be mixed race and it would make sense considering her name is of european origin. not to mention that there are plenty of immigrant families that change their names to fit the country s norm. frankly the fact that you re whining so much about a minor character s race is kinda weird. maybe stop ranting about twitter and  woke video game characters  or whatever and maybe you ll find happiness in life.
@soapbubble this argument again  have you seen a caucasian brunette woman  her with a  tan  doesn t automatically defaults to african decent. sheva is the real poc in the series.she have fair light complexion and had straight brush up hair in the og game. damnation is the continuity even if yoy don t give a crap on it so any direction to that is cannon. this remake took tjay advantage to crt the crap out of her for esg score. scrapping jolene to culturally appropriate two of her own voice works. we re not new to this va culture appropriation crap.
stop spreading fake news dude
@terry6024gxd  they just happened to hire an asian woman  i find that statistically unlikely.
@jeymez  you literally just said it was because she was asian she got the job to be a voice actress dude haha so yea. it had to do with that
@immortalslayer90  i m sure you re not someone who ever defends police officer for shooting black people but saying it was because they attacked the officer  your prolly say because he was black he was about lol
@ryang a white woman cant voice an asian woman. its obvious why capcom ditched her
capcom and the union couldn t agree on the wage. it was another bayonetta 3 situation
@norman readdis  i know mixed race people with even lighter skin tones than hunnigan s. i ve also seen mixed race people with straight hair. people also somehow believed that ada wong was a white woman prior to re2 remake  purely because of their perception of her physical appearance. the point is that visual appearance in resident evil games aren t always good indicators of a person s race. also  jolene s role as ada was not due to her race. it was the fact that she unionized  and capcom does not hire unionized voice actors. this is also why claire s old va did not return for re2 remake  despite them originally planning for her to reprise her role. also  it doesn t make sense that swapping out a white woman with an asian woman to play an asian character is  cultural appropriation   anyway.
no  she did not  she phoned it in. if that was actually her best  she should not have been hired in the first place.
@norman readdis  hunnigan had dark skin in the original game dude
@shine boi keke  ada is not half white  she s chinese american full blooded. but they didn t a fire a white woman  they just didn t bring her back for the role. ashley has a new va  and she s white. but for the first time ever  they wanted to have an asian female voice ada.
@jesse  no that s not it  capcom never kept the same voice for ada. re6  re2  re2 remake  re4  re4 remake  i can keep going. every other ada until now were all different people  it s just that this time they had someone new in mind for ada. so they didn t bring back the original voice because she was white  it s because white people don t have an asian accent  and ada is chinese. so ya in a sense that s how she got the job  but if they wanted ada to sound more asian  that s why they went that route. the original va had already reached out to her  even before all this pointless regarded drama started.
the black character was a black va too. i m noticing a pattern
@a cute lil  mint  notice how they always talk about making a character voiced by someone that is the same race as the character but we never get to have a conversation about kratos   ive noticed this
i see comments about union being a reason for not rehiring jolene however she made the statement that she hadn t even been contacted about the role so how was the union involved if she hadn t even been asked back
@christopher page  good question  sounds like they are trying to make an excuse to me
@d00mguy9000  calm down bro  geez
@dantheman33088  im just irritated because the voice is so bad it ruins the game for me in parts where ada appears  her voice literally lessens the experience i would have had of her voice was not in it
not her fault  you joking she s actually a real actress and was in the resident evil movie her performance is unacceptable.
this wasn t a race issue. i don t like lily s performance because i didn t think it matched ada s character. i really don t care if a white woman or an asian woman voices ada and i m asian.
@uryen in what time line are you living
@jeymez  that. isn t. why. jolene anderson went union. it she hadn t she would have gotten the role again. they didn t simply switch because they wanted someone asian.
@lux signifer  you are funny  the veterans hate re4  the game discarted the survival horror and dont followed the canon events of the original re3  for us its enjoyable to see any bad news about re4
@uryen  the numbers say otherwise  i think you are confusing the  i  with the  we
@immortalslayer90  you don t know that  everybody goes to a union. voice actors in the past have done it more than once  but no company not just capcom  but none of them like having to pay the client exactly what they want. im not saying it s fair  but you should better than anyone  the corporate world never has favored unions. it s why some businesses end up going out of business  or they take there business elsewhere. but people have bills to pay and put food on the table  we all know the feeling of what it s like when we feel underpaid. but compared to when she got the role then  the world is a different place today in giving people equal opportunities. women are no longer being underpaid  i highly doubt jolene was there only choice  so no even if i she didn t go union  there was still a chance they would go with someone new. not saying they had to be asian  but that s what they got  and im fine with it. we don t owe anything to these people  nor do they owe us anything  we re just people who play the game. people would sniff a wet fart if they knew a remake for resident evil code veronica was coming out  but there will always be those dingbat people who will whine and complain about anything. but even the one s who complain will buy the game and play it. how many people bought cyberpunk before shit hit the fan  lots of people  you know who didn t  me. why cause i never had an interest in the game  now im not saying we shouldn t hold companies accountable for releasing broken games  because we were the ones who gotta pay. but i don t give a shit who capcom decided to get to voice ada  as long as it feels like a resident evil game when you play it. but with cyberpunk  the game never appealed to me. even if the game came out just fine  im not into that type of genre.
@sam za  she sounded like she didnt even really try
@d00mguy9000  just like she didn t try in welcome to raccoon city  hell nobody tried in that film
@dantheman33088 tan skin complexion doesn t default african bruh. sigh...
yes
that s not why they dropped her  it was a union thing
@christopher page  that s not how business works  a company isn t going to contact you for work if they don t want to work with you.
while i was indifferent about lily s performance  at the end of the day it didnt ruin the game for me.i did like weskers new voice actor though
@alienoid gamer it s sad english va always got the short end of the stick in the gaming industry. they never do this on their jp vas because  jp corporate ethics and   senior respect . en va is always expendable. but both argument has weight on it specially nowadays from greed to politics. the irony here is the en va has more reception than their jp va in terms of this ips. kinda nefarious on crapcom s part. well they re not new to greed and exploitation. they re lesser evil than konami.
that does not sound like she s doing her best at all. if that s her best  then she sucks big time and shouldn t have been hired. i know a bad script and direction can fuck up an actor  but sometimes you also have to realize that the actor s aren t perfect and they can be bad  too. don t always go with  oh  they did their best with what they were given  it s not their fault   especially if their supposed  best  still sounds bad. oh  the harassment is still not warranted  by the way. just to make it clear  if people somehow think i m justifying it. i m not. but at the same time  i still have a negative opinion about her performance.
not wrong  but actions have consequences. no justice  no peace. lets play their game.voice actors basically suck ass on all projects these days so if this is getting special attention  i can assume  with confidence  how bad she must have been.
@norman readdis  bingo
@d00mguy9000  you don t want sony to have that conversation because then they will just make the last spartan kratos look like dennis rodman. because there was a black guy in ancient greece once.
no this false. capcom replaced jolene anderson because she was a union member. they are dodging controversies right now. remember what happened to helena taylor and platinum games last year  it really gives an impact on capcom so they don t hire union members now
just lol
@jeymez . ehh...no. ada was voiced by sally cahill in re2  re4  darkside chronicles and even she dubbed li binbing in the retribution film because she didn t speak english well. courtney taylor voiced ada in re6 and damnation  and even so  courtney studied sally s voice to keep the signature uniqueness that sally gave to ada. it was until the remakes that they started doing crazy things with ada s voice. so...no  you are wrong.
@seven  nobody did anything crazy to her voice  it s just someone new voicing her  she sounds funny in game but that might be an audio issue capcom should ve addressed before releasing the game. if you read reviews  digital foundary had pointed out some issues regarding the console and pc versions. ada s voice seem like her audio was off  some scenes she sounded okay in  but other times it didn t sound so great. re2 had some graphics issues when that first came out  it s a good thing they eventually went in to patch the game up. im not the biggest fan of there modern re engine  it looks good depending on how you tweak the settings  but it has a very grainy feel if you set the brightness past a certain point. alot of times you have to add some brightness in order to see the game clearly  on pc it s a little easier since you can set the resolution  but even on pc there games are very dark and blurry by default. now i realize the game is meant to be dark  but a horror game has nothing to do with graphics. your still just playing a game at the end of the day  fatal frame is a horror game with a dark setting and i can see that game clearly without having to fiddle around with settings. it s the same with the latest remake of fatal frame mask of the lunar eclipse  that was a game at one point that never got released outside of japan. still somebody took the time to remaster the game  and looks good for the most part. i think that engine best worked in re7  it looks good enough even in re village  but the 3 remakes so far from a graphical standpoint  they don t look as good. sometimes audio issues with glitch out in re3 when there s alot of action going on  that never happens in re7 or even re village. so ada sounding like she does in the game  it s most likely from that.
@jeymez  ada sounds bad because  lily is simply not a good va. the voice is not even really the problem  but her flat acting. she just read the script and call it a day. you don t have the need to post a wall text of excuses of why she is so bad. because this didn t happen before with other voices. if you want to be delusional  then go ahead. in any case  i just wanted to point out that you were wrong when commenting that ada has been voiced by a different actress in every game. that s false.
nothing wrong with having an asian va for an asian character. though i ll say  if that was their goal  they should ve got a good asian va.
@hyperion  people have forgotten that it s all acting  the art being someone else. unless it s an ethnic role where a heavy accent or native phrases are needed  the race should never matter.it s all a mess really. we have to course correct at some point.
@norman readdis  whud. hannigan is clearly an african american lady. and what about sheva  we re talking about re4 2005 and re5 2009  so was it always inclusive since orrr...
@nootnoot no she s not  caucasians can be tan you know. please don t tell me you don t know that or your rce upbringing is so isolated you can t see anyone having a slight hue to be other than african  now that s reecist. you literally stereotype a race.
@norman readdis  dudeee really  race card  can you not  im mixed race and i couldn t care less. played this game back in 2006 and i unconsciously saw hannigan as someone that looks of african american descent  mixed or likewise. whatever ethnicity she is  caucasian never crossed my mind. and i say this without any woke mindset. i mean  what  you think she has to have some stereotypically racist negro caricature to be  black   yeah well last i checked sheva has a tan brown complexion and even british english accent. but she s still african  cmon man. it doesn t have to be woke. we talking about pre-woke times where noone cared. hell re5 was getting called racist but no one who played the game saw it like that.
@nootnoot so you have some qualms with my mother then  she s a caucasian brunette that skin is as of hannigans and she s italian romanian decent  that s why i know she can t be a default african. i can somewhat agree with you if she s a latina since the game is also hispanic leaned but no let s make it african. the name is already a dead giveaway and i have presented way more proof than anyone arguing with me. this is not just  i feel .
if that was her best  imagine her worst
no  they did it because they didn t want to pay a fair union wage and wanted somebody cheaper
she was also insulting fans online cause they criticized her and didnt like her va. shes just as bad.
@corey mckee  those fans deserve it. i ve been a fan of re since 1997  it s embarrassing as a community as this whole attacking a va thing is utter bs. there s no defense for these obvious incels attacking someone who got approved casted for the role  if these morons want someone to blame.. then blame capcom. i have no issue with giving these people exactly what they give out.
she is the best ada in my opinion
skin color  tf  lmaooo
agreed
it s largely her fault. her vocal likeness itself isn t the problem  it s all about her delivery. she s monotone and flat for like 95  of her performance. she delivers little to no emotion or inflection in her voice the vast majority of the time  which could be completely fixed if she bothered to really understand her script and prepare herself when getting into character before a reading  and redoing a take here or there when her delivery wasn t up to par. but she sounded like she didn t care at all  which is an insult to the medium  other actors in the industry including her co-stars  the project  and the audience.
eeeeh  i mean this is her 2nd time doing ada. the first one being in that terrible 2021 movie that looked fan-made. her acting was pretty bad there too. you can blame capcom for hiring a bad actress if you want  but that doesn t excuse the fact that she seems to suck at her job. and yes  i do think it s partly race-related as they got a black chick to voice hunnigan and latinos for salazar and luis. none of the characters are modeled after their voice actors and they speak something like 2 lines of spanish during the entire game. the guy doing luis has 5 credits to his name and has only played in short films before this. a lot of the actors in general have had minor roles in stuff like cw arrowverse shows  so capcom wasn t exactly aiming for the cream of the crop.
@drew2 fast  its not a singing competition that her pitch and sound needs to be something thats not asian and weirdly white. lily s asian accent sounds perfect to me. ps   i am also an asian.
@rurii i don t care about singing - that has nothing to do with anything - i just don t like her voice and i m not alone in that.  it blows my mind that people  especially asians  are talking like asians all sound the same. they don t. i ve known and known of asians with all kinds of pitches.
@drew2 fast  did the old va sounded asian    what if a korean is voiced by an american. can tell difference only if you are a native person.
@rurii  that depends on the asian you compare her to. some asians  sound asian   some don t. again  not all asians sound the same.
@soapbubble  right lol wtf are these people talking about  i hate race swapping too because its unnecessary but come on lol  ingrid has always been a women of color. maybe its just more pronounced now because her hair is kinky
and also she wasn t bad she was good. she was different but good and i hope people would respect her
@imic hilton  the thing is this breaks the consistency of the continuity. unlike ashley  ada had been in the 2nd game. for a japanese company that s known for consistency. they re falling off nowadays because capcom since 2020 has been leaked to pass down esg memo.
@imic hilton  it was not good in the slightest. i m just grateful they cut her dialogue significantly from the original. the original had 2 or 3 scenes between her and krauser  and if they were still there that would just be more scenes i d have to skip.no way am i buying an ada dlc with that voice  it s unbearable every time i hear it  and you d probably have to hear it a lot in an ada dlc.
@norman readdis  what are you talkin about capcom has been on a roll. dmc5  monster hunter  re4  and street fighter 6 directly addressing what the fans wanted and more. incredible amount of transparency and openess in sf6 specfically.
@mrmooguy91 you know overton window right being  on a roll  does not effect overton window. look at capcom leaked  diversity  inclusion  plan. i m really buffled people s tendency of memory lost. japanese companies are leaning towards esg nowadays. squenix is the 1st official esg company. capcom and bandai namco is still handing out memos.
@norman readdis  the one that supposedly said dee jay from street fighter was dropping his rastafarian influence  weird how dee jay has more of that influence then ever now... think this was the same  leak   that said they were going to make a ton of street fighter characters gay and pc  and now we have insane jiggle physics on cammy s butt instead. it also said it was going to remove boob armor from monster hunter and it s still present. almost like you shouldn t have a knee-jerk reaction to everything you read and should actually let a person or company s actions speak for themselves. practically none of capcom s recent releases have done anything that that s supposed document said they were going to. do you play any of these games that you are having a panic attack about  there s nothing pc or  forced diversity  in their recent games  which are respecting the source material now more than ever.
@mrmooguy91 if you re seeing this only on the sxualization alone  you re mistaken. st 6 now have an abby character and the very stereotypical balck ninja girl. japan is still not as egregious as the western devs but there s signs. capcom really need to be like disney for you to see the system huh  anyway. never say i didn t try. i ll just play razirfist clip once it happens more and become more obvious like some of squenix s game. forespoken cough cough. which is initially agni s philosophy.
@norman readdis  i specifically mention dj in a non-sexual way but i could see that cherry-picking is very much in your nature. i m referencing very specific things from that leak that turned out to be completely untrue and that is undeniable. really i pointed out three things that leak said was going to happen and the opposite happened i want you to address that specifically.  comparing last of us  a game that is  attempting grounded realism  to street fighter  where characters jump 12 ft in the air and punch mountains in half is absurd. yes there is a muscular female who is completely over-the-top descendant of spartans and is obsessed with spartan culture and even cut her hair like a gladiator helmet. her entire family seems to be absurdly large. comparing last of us to street fighter is like the most asinine thing ever.  like most things in street fighter it is deliberately absurd and over-the-top you don t even know the names of the character. a  black ninja  yeah she is part of a clan  and you can go back to the 90s and look up a character named sean. you are so obviously ignorant of the franchise and its history and its back story.  ryu is a stereotypical japanese warrior trope  is he somehow part of your delusional diversity inclusion now too
@mrmooguy91 dj is basically years before the capcom memo happened. there nothing to talk about him.tlou2 is  grounded  yeah that gains cannot be achieved in the post apocalyptic  reality . lolst do have diverse people that s why it s characters are portrayed in a country. but the ober the top is still associated with that countries culture. that ninja girl is very modern stereotype of a black person loving asian stuff. there s no spartan woman. and it s basically trying to make parody of their bodybuilding cafe in japan.i know. i know you want to justify modern industry but let me assure you  you are going to notice it more soon. as if this past decade wasn t yet  if not  i cannot help you anymore and i do love gaming as a core and a collector since 2600. i don t want it to be ruined like the movie industry nowadays because people always give a benefit of a doubt and had a short term memory lost. the rot is just spreading. brace yourselves.
@imic hilton  she was terrible
yeah  and they drastically cut her dialogue compared to the original. it s almost like somebody working there knew it was terrible so they did us a favor and cut her lines.there were 2 or 3 scenes between her and krauser that were completely cut from the game  which would normally bother me but now i m grateful  that s just fewer scenes i need to skip.no way am i buying an ada dlc with that voice. in a separate ways dlc she would have a lot of dialogue  and it s just unbearable every time i hear it. it s so annoying that the remaster was done way better than i expected  but they had to find some way to screw it up.like melonie i m not a huge fan of her voice in re2r  but that would be miles better than this. personally her voice in re6 was my favorite  i think she played that role perfectly.
what about owen wilson for leon   richard simmons for kraur.
@jack m  ada wong was my favorite part of the original game so the fact that they ruined her in the remakes guarantees i will never play it and ignore everone s bullshit praise of this trash game.
@holdincontempt  if you haven t even played this  how can you decide whether it s trash or not  just because people don t like one voice acting performance  frankly the performance of ada is the only major gripe the vast majority of people have with the game.
@soapbubble  it doesn t matter because channels like this have been promoting insane amount of outrage culture. there are definitely times where source material or franchises are being directly disrespected but this isn t one of them by far. it doesn t really matter because people are just addicted to the negativity now. just like the mainstream news. they got a narrative and they re sticking to it
i would have definitely been behind a leon voiced by david spade just out of pure enjoyment lol
@mrmooguy91  makes sense. crazy to see how easily people can get manipulated into giving these hilariously stupid takes based on very little information.
@soapbubble  anger sells  mainstream news has known that for decades and many  influencers  know it to. it gets clicks. i m not denying that some companies go out of their way to disrespect franchises or fanbases. but there are so many pockets of gamers who just put on a 1 size fits all mentality.  personal i thought ada sounded fine. not my favorite version but i also think they were leaving more gaps because her dlc will be very significant. she is very much still a mysterious female fatale with unknown motives. nothing here disrespect that  and the rest of the game very much embodies the original.
honestly i got the remake and i think it s bad head to tail. i don t think the leon va is good either. in the second remake it was fine but here he wasn t. david spade would have at least given me something laugh at instead of just getting frustrated at bad combat mechanics  bad va  and bad narrative.
adam sandler as leon  maybe i haven t played this game. i m still trying to get to the  games that i bought last year!
@norman readdis   @norman readdis  it hasn t. they ve had years to go and change his design. do you have any idea what you re talkin about  i said tlou attempts grounded realism  but abby has no believable reason to be huge  but her personality also sucks.  i said comparing it to street fighter is asinine. uh no marissa and heer family very much have some spartan or romam bloodline nonsense going on. not similar to abbey at all because the nature of the game is not attempting realism or some sort of  double meaning. unlike the last of us street fighter does not take itself seriously. her entire family is absurdly large and they all have the same gladiator haircut. you re trying to draw false equivalence. your telling me i m ignoring things but you can t even name these characters. the black ninja is kimberly  she is directly related to another character that debuted in the 90s. i also think you are greatly exaggerating whatever it is about her skin color and culture but you re also just not really saying what your issue is. i think you are trying to make implications about stereotypes which is why i brought up ryu and his very stereotypical samurai warrior tropes.i will tell you for the third time that i am referencing specific things from that leak document that you are citing that have been proven to be false. you keep trying to move the goalposts and expand the conversation. just admit that the leak was wrong.
yep. if someone offered to pay me for voice acting  even knowing that i sucked at it  i d do my best and cash the check.i d probably have to change my name and be incognito to avoid the backlash. but at least i got paid!
@jack m  there s literally nothing wrong with the voice at all you doing way too much over a fictional character voice if you this salty then don t play the resident evil games it s that simple
@norman readdis  your whole post is the definition of outrage lol.
@norman readdis  in terms of voice acting for resident evil  capcom is anything but consistent. i m pretty sure re4 remake is the first time leon has had a voice actor come back from a previous game.
@big cade they are with their jp va. they never replaced them compared to the en. this applies to the whole jp industry in compare to en va. even kojima replace david but not the jp va. og re jp va in all the games is still the va for the remakes.
@norman readdis  and where is this series most popular at  hint it isn t japan  and even then changing voices is sometimes needed  that s why goku jp voice is bad now  hasn t changed in years
@raymkkkk dude without japan it s not gonna be well known in the overseas. also compare the population overseas  japan still have the main priority.  sean schemmel is still the va of goku in english at least there s something and mariko has been the va of goku in japan and others  they respect their va. they let them stay for how long they want and of course she s quite old nowadays what do you expect. the vas in english haven t even reach senior citizen yet and they re throwing them off the curve even if they re iconic and no drama attach to them.i ve work as a multimedia artist in a company that s owned by a japanese before. they literally prioritize themselves even if they re not that good and they have this  senpai  kohai  mentality that a senior is kept no matter what.don t give me the crap reasoning about mariko. they still love her in japan and no one is complaining than the overseas weebs.
@imic hilton . she wasn t bad  she was terrible and horrendous. she doesn t deserve to be bullied  but neither it s okay to sugar coat her horrible performance.
@norman readdis . yes  i think in ff 7r  the jp vas are the same too.
@big cade   you are exaggerating a lot there if you think leon  remake  is the first actor to come back. alysson court voiced claire in all her appearances  including spin offs and the degeneration movie  until resident evil revelations 2. she was even contacted by capcom to reprise her role in the remake of 2  but was later discarded when capcom started it s policy of not working with union actors. ada was voiced by sally cahill in re2  re4  darkside chronicles  and even dubbed the live action actress of retribution because she didn t speak english well.once roger craig smith took over chris  role in re5 he voiced him in every game  spin off  and appearance until  again  capcom stopped working with union voice actors  in his case was until re7 . leon has been voiced mainly by paul mercier  re4  degeneration  and darkside chronicles  and by matt mercier  re6  damnation and vendetta . from the main heroes is actually only jill the one who has been very inconsistent in her va  being voiced by a different va in every main appearance and even in some spin offs. let s hope nicole tompkins has arrived to stay this time. but  yes  leon remake2 is not the first actor to reprise his role.
@seven even in crisis core and honestly most of them  from anime to games. vas in japan is treated with respect.
it doesn t matter if it was  beloved  or how much people cared  people will always bitch.
@holdincontempt  i guarantee i played the original and loved it more than you. i ve played it many times on many different consoles starting with the ps2  the most recent one being vr. it is my favorite game of all time. her voice didn t even register as an issue. they wanted a much more serious retelling of the story and as many times as the original was  remastered   no one wanted the exact same story over again. leon becomes battle hardened and changed in those six years since the outbreak  why not her  it will never hold up to the original  but all considered  it was a masterpiece. the fact that you won t even give it a try tells me you aren t even close to a serious fan of the game or series.
exactly  and the thing im worried anout is there was people speculating separate ways might be a dlc  if that happens nobody will buy it and itll be shredded in the fan reviews if it does happen and the voice is going to be the reason i wont buy it
@wookieninja87  good on you glad you are one of the few
@d00mguy9000  is going to be bought not because of her voice but the story aspect to it you do you my guy but if that dlc comes  it will still do welldon t talk fir everyone
@docbravo   now that i d pay to see
i can take different  i just don t think the delivery was good.
you just gave me the worst idea to known to man
@docbravo   ramon threatens leon leon voiced by owen wilson  no thanks brah
@wookieninja87 the combat is fine
@chandller burse  no it isn t. leon is sluggish while the enemies move smooth and normal. bosses move really fast and quick like super man. sometimes hits don t register on enemies or they are just not fazed by them at all. one thing i found is i will go into a fight and it would be almost impossible and i would die. retry it and then it would be super fucking easy like the game gave it to me. it s so fucking weird. anyways after i faced and died to the super saiyan ramon who can shoot through the map and stun lock you to death while also being super fast as well  i said fuck it. i was streaming it too. this remake really isn t that good. i played the original on normal and beat it. sure controls didn t feel the best but combat was still smooth and leon responded like normal. remake the controls are better but combat is was fucking worse and i m not the only one who has noticed.
@wookieninja87  i haven t experienced hits not registering other than hits not registering with leon that is probably something an update needs to fix not a permanent feature anyways.also i ve been playing the game on standard and have only recently died after playing it for multiple days now.so i don t know about the easy thing.honestly my method is shoot head melee knife anyways which is most effective other than shotgun
@wookieninja87  good god the controls in the original suck i don t even care if i am speaking from some gen z perspective i grew up watching my brother play the original i even played the first re and the tank controls mixed with third person is just terrible
@wookieninja87  also i mean i get getting frustrated at it being hard but honestly it either needs an update or you need to lower difficulty difficulty in modern games today do suck since harder ones are just unfair rather than actually difficult.
@chandller burse  ......you didn t read my comment. if you did you would have seen where i said the controls weren t that great but the combat was smooth in the original but in the remake the controls are good but combat is sluggish and unresponsive.
@chandller burse  i was playing on standard. i have played all the originals and the remakes. i just play them on standard or normal difficulty. this is the first time that playing on standard i have hated the game and wanted to permanently quit before beating it. i m sorry re3 remake sucked but i at least played and beat it before moving on. this one i haven t.
@wookieninja87  i did read that part i am almost 100  sure i didn t really say anything about it being sluggish or the combat being smooth in the original in my opinion it really wasnt since especially on newer versions it seems leon is hard as hell to control stopping and aiming is difficult sometimes also the ability to melee someone seemed a lot more harder to do at times.
@wookieninja87  why even keep the game then  its so odd people legit hate a game for what i see as kind of minor issues that can be fixed by the way lol.and yet they not only keep it they try to beat it. if you re not having fun just fucking don t this crap is always dumb to me i don t care what excuse there is if you cannot find any enjoyment and legit hate it quit and throw it away or something you already will not get your moneys worth anyways.unless you re some kind of critic or masochist i mean lol.
@wookieninja87  also at least re4r has so far retained more content than re3r did in its first five minutes
@chandller burse  no you are confusing the controls with combat. they are two separate things. there is a video about this here on youtube i ll try to find it and see if i can share so you can better understand.
she sounds like a depressed emo girl
the remix still blows the original out of the water
@chandller burse  the tom that is 1000 times better than the original  which was trash
@aaron roberto  only if you are a blinded fool. original was way better. it had tense moments but was so fun and funny due to how campy it was. tank controls were a bit stiff and dated but you could see why it had to be as dual joystick movement still wasn t a thing then.combat however was flawless. enemies weren t too fast so you could get swarmed but also still escape. the knife didn t break so if you ran out of ammo you at least had something to fall back on to defend yourself. the remake falls flat hard on all these things and these were the things that made resident evil 4.
oh god that s a visual i can t stop thinking about now
people will nitpick everything and nevermind how well made game could be especially game like re4  re4 fanboys are toxic people who will nitpick the hell out of game  so who cares  tho i agree ada va is not great but i don t care
@firedan  see you are a part of the problem. the game objectively isn t that great. someone who is a fan has played it when it was and seen how awesome it was and then plays a remake and feels and sees how much worse it is. they call it out or are vocal and you call them toxic. no you are the toxic one if any. everyone has the right to be upset especially about something they love. the remake is not better than the original. the combat is worse  the voice acting and dialogue is worse  and because the dialogue is worse the story is worse. the story is the same but what made the original so good was the campiness in the story that has all been taken out. you know what people don t forget  being chased by a giant statue of an adult kid. do you know what people do forget  a crappy forced knife fight where dodging and parrying is next to impossible while the enemy destroys you in stun locks. imo most off the bad is ignorable there is one major thing that isn t though. all the enemies and bosses move as if they are on slide gel. super smooth and fast. leon moves like it s the middle of january and he s got severe arthritis in the middle of a blizzard. he s so slow and clunky that fighting isn t fun. it s a forced handicap against you. out of all things this is what made me quit the game. i didn t like the original crontrols but combat was fine and i beat that game multiple times. funny how i beat the one you said sucks but the one you deem  awesome  i can t bring myself to push through for even one playthrough.
who knows  maybe this was her performance even after lessons.
idk how the voice acting industry works..but wouldn t you have to pass basic training even if you selected by appearance...
@jack straw  the voice acting industry is undervalued and disrespected  that s why they have to join a union to at-least get paid a living wage. capcom treats them like trash thus made it a point to avoid casting professional vas since 2017. capcom contacted her directly bc she had a 30 sec cameo in wtrc and was a cheap canadian hire. literally the first asian person they could think of  basically the saying they just casting any asian girl off the street . there clearly wasn t any actual fair auditions in place  bc no way would she have beaten out actual asian vas.
phil lamar is also the voice of ramza beoulve in final fantasy tactics and dissidia nt  if you know the character  you will see that s another good example of casting because of pure talent.
i played the original and loved it dearly. i ve played it many times on many different consoles starting with the ps2  the most recent one being vr. it is my favorite game of all time. her voice didn t even register as an issue. they wanted a much more serious retelling of the story and as many times as the original was  remastered   no one wanted the exact same story over again. leon becomes battle hardened and changed in those six years since the outbreak  why not her  it will never hold up to the original  but all considered  it was a masterpiece. i had zero problems with her voice. if people did  that s their right  but this comment section is filled with assholes using it to completely devalue this phenomenal remake of my favorite game and video game series.
most talking shit about the game like that are refusing to even play it  so that shows how big of a fan they truly were that they won t even consider giving it a try for themselves  they just simply dismiss it and it pisses me off.
@aaron p.  i played the game  i beat it yesterday  i hated the voice  i played the original as well i loved the voice
@d00mguy9000  that s fine  as long as something so trivial doesn t make you hate a very well-done remake of game. personally  even if i hated the voice  i say the ashley we received that i liked much more and hated the original more than makes up for it lol
@aaron p.  resident evil 4 remake i would give a 9 10 but if they hired a better voice actress for ada and let us swap out the voice for her. this game would be 11 10 in my opinion. shes the only blemish on this game. the game is flawless apart from ada.
girl what. this is why she is a small channel now. imagine purposely finding comments that aren t bullying meanwhile i have actually seen death threats on her comments
@aaron p.  i played the original often as well and i also think that the new ada sounds fine i really rewatched the scenes and don t see what the issue is lol ppl are weird
lol so true  only thing missing was a sigh after
exactly how people improve. simple as that. critism makes u better.    it s the same why acting now is bad  people can t  improve if u keep telling the emperor he s amazing while wearing nothing.japan is pretty good with va because of that..   granted i didn t like japanese leon s voice  too low
yea criticism is good but not harassment   bullying  have you seen those disgusting comments that left on her instagram  post before she deleted it  you ruined my game   now i m going to ruin your career  that s not a criticism that s straight up giving a threat ! people these days needs to know the differences between criticism   harassment they are not the same! the consequences of it is too damn high  just harsh words today in our society can simply kill a person.think about it mate.
@     rpghsgaming  i don t know if that is for me or not  but if that is what is happening then that is ignorant. i was speaking on criticism alone and how some take it the wrong way.   i m not a big social media guy   just way too much stupidity for my taste especially twitter. that s one platform i refuse to touch   because something is seriously wrong with those people. never understood why anybody would want to be around them.
@thephenom389x  glad you understand mate thanks.
@     rpghsgaming  harsh words can simply kill a person  what are you saying  that this criticism will incite violence or that people are so hyper sensitive that criticism is the equivalent of violence.
@john smith   this person is saying bullying destroyes mental health and drive people to suicide.  that was fine example  commenting to the actress that she ruined their game and she bad ......thats not criticism.
@xxwriterclare nocturnexx  how rude  don t answer questions for other people.
@thephenom389x  she got death threats as well  but sure let s take that as criticism
@faiz fuad  i guess you overlooked my other response  where i said if people are taking it that far then that is ignorant.
she is literally ada in the live action  please a dead va and her fans hating on a woman with more money then all of you combined is a joke
@bunny  she played ada in a failed show. i don t see how that supports your argument.
@major gear  both the show and the move did loads better then anything this girl has been apart of is my point. and no one had a problem with lily s acting or voice then and clearly your not a resident evil fan if all you can remember is the show
@bunny  ahhh yes  the old fallacy of  if you can t make do something better  then you criticizing those that can is a joke .  i don t give a shit if the new va is the spitting image of ada  nor do i give a damn about her previous roles  and i certainly won t hold it against her that she played ada in raccoon shitty....her performance in this game sounds akin to if a teacher called on a 4th grader and asked her to read these lines in front of the class  and she had no interest in doing so.  monotone  no recognizable inflection at all.  just like a loaf of bread sitting out on the counter for a month...stale.ada s been around a lot longer than welcome to raccoon shitty  and has been through numerous va s.  this present performance   it just plane bad  you can defend it however you choose  but that doesn t change the issue.
@beholdmystrength  okay so so was leon s performance we re is your rant  cause they sounded nearly identically in there delivery and cadence. and actually i m not really defending her. i just genuinely like her performance and i also completely disagree with the entire harass and bully hive mind that simple brained people like you have. i mean who attacks the actress personally knowing their are vocal coaches  directors  and producers behind this project that instructed her to perform this way if they had a problem with it they would have made her redo her lines. so somehow somewhere this is how they wanted both her and leon to perform those lines because neither of them sound better then the other
@ wilberforce wooster they removed the voice actress from re2 remake because she joined union and capcom are non union. so they didn t hit up for re4 remake and just got lily to voice ada in re4 remake since she s not union.
@mrbgp006  wong is also in the union  sag aftra covers va and actors.
is it possible she didn t want to come back or was not available
if i m not mistaken leon s va was changed to reflect the time jump. which is fine  if ada actually turned out sounding good. even if being race accurate was an added bonus for capcom  personally idc as long as the character sounds good  there are plenty of great asian vas that could ve pulled it off. agree in that they made a bad decision with ada s casting.
@gaming disorder  she actually stated she wanted to come back but capcom didn t contact her again.edit  tho  personally  i don t think jolene was a good ada either.
@rustie . well  you are mistaken. both  matt mercer  leon re6  damnation and vendetta  and alysson court  original claire who voiced her in every appearance  main game  spin off  and movie until revelations 2  were contacted by capcom to reprise their roles as leon and claire respectively for the remake  they even expressed their happiness about it. but then  capcom decided to go with non-union vas and banished both of them.
capcom is handing out cultural appropriation memo since 2020. just google it. they even make hannigan a caucasian brunette a poc because the va needs appropriation. yes capcom is not new to this. remember morrison in dmc 5
this is why i m honestly sick of seeing celebrity voice actors in animated movies. they either don t fit the character and end up playing themselves for the 100th time  or just sound... off. actual voice actors or people who can do both always do a better job. like musical theater actors can often pull off both because they have to focus a lot on manipulating their vocal tone  but an actor who doesn t do that  no  don t think so.it s the same vice-versa  if a person who s only ever done voice acting has to do live acting  it may seem off because that person isn t accustomed to having to manipulate his body language when he acts.
i heard she was terrible in that movie as well  and the movie was just awful in general.
exactly  its like when they got rid of david hayter as snake for mgs5.
@norman readdis  atleast hunnigan was decent.
@norman readdis  yeah but hunnigan  the actress playing her was good  ada here is bad  if she wasn t bad people would not mention it.
@frank kennedy yeah but a swap is a swap like black ariel sing well but it s still a swap.
@blackvipergx i already said it. yeah but this can fall onto arial is a good aigner so it s justifiable right
@norman readdis  what
@blackvipergx i said if you re ok with this i m sure you re ok with the new little mermaid because the actress sing well.
@norman readdis  you are honestly comparing live action vs voice acting
@blackvipergx  re damnation is not live action lol damnation is literally the cgi movie that s cannon to the games.
@norman readdis  wtf are you even talking about now   dude really we are speaking voice acting  then you bring black ariel out of nowhere  and that s a live action nothing to do with the subject and now damnation   dude leave the computer or cellphone  go touch some grass and breath
@blackvipergx  i m comparing about the race swap live action or not. the va of remake hannigan is like cleveland if it s not balck it can t be voice by anyone else.both comparison is basically it s initially voiced  acted character by a non  poc  person but  poc  needs to be spoon fed nowadays so they can take whatever they want. you need to be aware of of this oe you are part of the problem. they re always gonna go a mile on the inch you gave them.
suprisingly  there are movies where the actors lines are dubbed over by another person. i didn t know this until recently.
@major gear just like bumblebee movie with peter cullen. his voice is a patch work. still can believe the director approved this.oh so as darth vader.
@norman readdis  i think you missed the point that frank seems to have been dancing around  political agenda alone doesn t cover the quality control problem put on display.  you can take out race-swapping and still have that glaring issue. a company willing to approve of such a terrible performance from ada s va can t be trusted to uphold consistent standards  just in general.  in a weird way  you re giving capcom an excuse to fall back on.   oh  but modern politics made us screw up even the most basic of things  and it made my buddy forget how to tie his shoelaces  too!
@norman readdis . it s voice acting. i couldn t care less if the va of ada is asian  or if the va of hunnigan is brunette  black or whatever. it s about the performance. if they want an asian lady to voice ada  i couldn t care less  what i care is that she does a good job  lily gao didn t do a good job  that s the problem. i am not seeing the va face when playing the game anyway.
ikr  however scarlet johansson did a pretty good job at voice acting as an actress.
@blackvipergx exactly  if lily performed at least a decent level. i think people won t bug that much but her acting is just poor
you mean that abomination of  welcome to raccoon city   lol  well it all makes sense now.
@norman readdis  stupidest thing ever. it s a voice. chris judge did great as kratos.
@gingerzombie29 where did i bring up judge  that s the stupidest reply i ever red. lol
the  see you later  in the boat scene made me laugh out loud. and when luis asks for cigarettes  i do  the kind you like . yikes
@kazserah that exact cigarettes line to luis took me out of it hard. didn t fit for me at all
if separate ways is coming  i think it will be a little difficult to forget about it.
she doesn t tho  she does voice overs in other things and she s fine.  yet somehow she sucks here  how is it her fault at that point and not the studios that said this was okay
@raymkkkk  it might not be her fault  it might be the studio s or the casting director crew s fault. i m not familiar with what other work she s done but just because she does other voice over and things like that doesn t mean that she s the right pick for the role. me personally  i didn t like her as ada. does she deserve the harsh treatment  i don t think so but if she s gonna play ada again in future games  she should listen to some of the criticism.
@jpeg  i agree  but toxic comments isn t criticism. i hate her as ada  but i m just saying capcom regardless is at fault.  they thought this was good enough  its on them.
@raymkkkk  what other things   i can t find any other voice acting role she did.
how does she deserve criticism  do you not understand how va works  she sounds like that out of capcom s direction.99  of va can do multiple voices and pitches  she s only following order  this is what capcom want ada to sounds like in re4.if you hate ada s voice  blame capcom.
@sleepingdragon this is her first time doing the voice acting.
@quartza_  yeah i know  the guy i was responding to said she did other voice overs.
she deserves the criticism. it will make capcom aware and maybe they won t cast ppl based solely on their race  wow this is the least racist comment ever
@     care to explain
sally cahill is the best for me too. she s the original ada from 3 early games.in remakes  most of the lines are sarcasm-ized  verbally and visually.ada wong goes from a soft-seductive person into authoritative character.perhaps someone in capcom actually want ada wong to be just like that  thus intentionally chose gao for the role.like you said  gao got the role because someone gave the approval.but maybe  hopefully  gao will perform better in the upcoming dlc  if she still get that role
i don t think we spent enough time with ada to really judge her performance. i wish they had brought back jolene anderson but it is what it is. they should have seen this coming though  they absolutely knew how much scrutiny this game would recieve.
yeah  re4 remake ada doesn t hold a candle to re2 remake ada. capcom really needs to pull a sega and nail down who is going to voice their characters for a decade. lily gao should ve been given a role that s more suited to her style  re4 remake s ada just did not click with her.
...i didn t even think the performance was bad.sally cahill has some pretty big shoes to fill and nobody comes close to her  but lily s rendition wasn t bad. she toned down the seductiveness and sounded more aloof  which i thought was fitting for ada and was also consistent with re2 remake s ada.
as someone who has never played any other re games besides this remake  i kind of liked ada s voice. it felt natural
got someone of the same race to voice the character and they gone f    d it up  honestly couldn t stop laughing at the comparison
i guess i ve only seen her in the one scene. but this is also on the director   producers. they hired her. they can direct her as to how to talk.  more energy! less energy   at least they nailed leon and luis.
this is why i will always prefer japanese va s. over there  being a va is a big deal  and they stay professional. there are few exceptions  but the agencies that represent voice talent in japan know when they should jump in and do damage control and tell their actors to shut up and let them handle it.
if you choose to not look at it as a diversity issue  jolene supposedly joined a union where capcom dislikes. it s a more appropriate company reason then what you hear from random people on the internet. side note lily gao herself said would love to keep playing as ada forever in a live interview before. she s done her research and i think whether her performance is bad we should try to be nice and make better constructive criticism so her work can improve in the future.
ada wong s seductive personality was carried along mostly by her voice actress over the years. this is and was true for everyone who stepped up to play her except lily gao.i don t know who to be more disappointed in capcom or the va. the devs who thought this mediocre performance was good enough should be held accountable. with that being said  no harassment or bullying. i think criticism is good because it sends a clear message to the developers to tell them they effed up. i hate when people throw genuine criticism out the window because some random flaccid pricks decide to bully the actor actress.edit  as expected. some obviously brain-dead people in the replies have come to defend this performance. she didn t do a good job representing ada. nobody complained about the previous vas before because they did a fantastic and perfect job. if something is wrong. it is wrong people. stop s cking their d cks. it s not a matter of if my opinion contradicts your opinion then we both have different tastes. no absolutely not. it s bad. it s a plain simple fact. devs look at gamers and decide if whatever they are doing is alright. if you people constantly support bad performances then how tf are devs supposed to know what we like and what s right  why can t you people digest simple facts  she didn t do a good job and anyone who can bang two brain cells together can deduce that conclusion. this stupid polarization is causing this pandemic of broken  half-assed  buggy and unfinished game releases because even cyberpunk 2077 was defended at launch. be realistic. don t throw objectivity out the window because you like someone or something. jeez.
the huge disconnect between ada s character and the va is not only because of the level of voice acting the actress was doing. it s also because ada s face model isn t really a good match for that va s voice type. re4 remake s ada is like a 1 1 face-match of kristin kreuk  lana from smallville  chun-li from the live-action . her voice is nothing like the va s voice-type at all and the dissonance is very obvious when you have the model on a cutscene  and then the voice comes out.with regards to the whole  should people send their criticisms to capcom instead of the va   thing  there is really no argument if people want to send their personal opinions to the va herself. it is  after all  a criticism of her own performance. being a va means that you have to  act the part out   and that can definitely include changing your voice  if you can . you re not there to speak as yourself. you re there to give life to a fictional character with its own voice. not yours. this applies especially with animation  and a clear example is anime  with vas there literally voicing characters that range from kids to femme fatale adults. hard and tough criticism  that just goes with the territory for showbiz. just imagine how much personal criticism gets thrown to actual hollywood actors.as for capcom being on the receiving end  you can bet that the company probably won t even care or bother passing it down. you criticize a performer for their individual performance. at most  that would extend to the small group of folks directly involved in the filming process  not the entire dev team. i wouldn t even be surprised if the japanese devs that made the game had it on the japanese dub on their end and just let the west folks deal with the english dub side.all-in-all  the main issue here is that she did a bad job  was criticized for it  and her way of dealing with criticism is the same old now-popular  lack of accountability  mindset wherein she runs away from any accountability on her end and blames others for her own mistakes.you could at least take the criticism head-on and try to do better next time instead of hiding inside your  safe space  like a fragile snowflake and then calling paying customers  entitled . because at the end of the day  they are entitled seeing as they pay for the salary you got......interestingly enough  i guess this is the reason why japanese people call customers       or  okyaku-sama   basically customer but with the honorific  -sama  that is used towards somebody who is being treated as more important than the speaker . the western culture seems to be very fine and in tune with treating their own paying customers as garbage and not worth listening to if they don t fall in line with whatever the company individual celebrity wants.
i actually really liked it at first i didn t and felt it was bland but the more i played it the more i like it and i really think it suits her!!!
thanks for covering this and your opinions on it. it seems like no one else in the fellowship is touching this story.
wow  i didn t know how bad it was.  i hadn t heard her voice until just now watching this video.  but i honestly wouldn t criticize lily gao for it.  she sounds the way she sounds.  that s her voice.  this misstep is 100 percent on the person in charge of casting.  they should have known better immediately upon hearing her.  no way was she the right fit for ada.  but like you said  it s not like lily is going to turn down a paycheck.
ironically she looks like the character she voiced unlike every other voice actor lol plus its the director and others who execute decisions i think...she did fine to me  like most ada s  but we have actors for a reason because many prefer alternatives to  reality  for entertainment  most wouldn t want the real ada if she sounded like lily gao...
hideki kamiya himself told his producers back in resident evil 2 he wanted ada with a mature and seductive voice. it was stablished  and even when there s was the replacements of va they keep up with the impression. i don t even have to dive to much into that  just imagine any other kind of impression for darth vader other than the one that is already set in stone  just doesn t make sense
she s not that bad. she s definitely a different take but i like certain parts  don t line others. i would like a bit more emotion but not too much. she didn t give enough but not having too much makes sense. the new voice has a more  stone cold serious spy  feel to it while the ada in the original games had a more  femme fatal  feel. going for an inbetween of those two would ve been perfect but whether intentional or not  they weighed a bit far into the stone cold aspect. i don t have any problems with changing her voice actor as voice actors in resident evil change all the time but at the same time  adas new actor should ve been shown some clips of re2r to try replicate that voice as much as sge could. her voice isn t bad but it is on the weaker end of ada voice actors. still  people are massively overreacting about this. it isn t a big deal especially because it s only half of the character who isn t even a main character. also  an arguably lackluster performance for a character doesn t ruin the game at all and some of the behavior i ve seen about this minor change is pathetic. some resident evil fans are really entitled.
just finished the game yesterday  and she did an alright job. as you said  the faults more on the studio director for sacking the former voice actress who has been there for all the other games.
courtney s version isn t so bad when you compare it to the next year. lol.if i were paid the amount of money that she was to absolutely butcher any sort of a job  i would expect the backlash  in this case  she is claiming to be a professional voice actress  and she should know how to ask for appropriate feedback in order to ensure that she is doing the most quality work she can from the producers perspective. maybe someone can have their girlfriend or anyone really read the lines and create an awesome mod for the game.
i dont think her voice is necessarily bad i think the audio engineering and delivery wasn t monitored very well and they just went with the first takes
jolene unionised against capcom  they will not bring her back.
ikr  she sounds way way way off ngl
weeb. va is a big deal in the u.s. as well. it s not the va s fault  but the production.
i always prefer japanese va s and this is where you don t get to talk about american va s. we actually care here. i d rather want ashley to sound her age than sound way younger
@xiaoyuuu  who are you to decide who gets to talk about american voice actors  in anime the ratio of terrible american voice actors to quality one s is shameful. there is a stark difference in quality. who is  we  who care is the difference due to a lack of care or a lack of talent  someone can care all they want  if they don t have the talent then they don t have the talent and in most cases no amount of caring or even effort can make up for that.if by wanting ashley to sound her age you re referring to ashley sounding young in the original re4  that was because she was originally supposed to be young. still in high school. late in production capcom realised this wouldn t fly with western audiences and her age was adjusted upwards.she sounds how she was originally supposed to.that s also irrelevant to what melonie s video is about.this voice actress decided to handle criticism by nuking her instagram  except of course for one post about  white supremacy who knows how many others like it were on her instagram before. the race of a va is irrelevant. they either do a good job or bad job and after listening to comparison video s her performance was objectively bad. the appropriate way to handle criticism  harassment is different and there has been exceedingly little of that  is not to blame that criticism on  white supremacy  though to explain why you took the character in that direction and to take that feedback on board if you re lucky enough to play the character in the future. it seems the va did not do her homework on the character she was playing. does capcom bear the lions share of responsibility for ada being poorly represented  of course.does lily gao bear some responsibility  absolutely  and had she handled criticism with some grace then it would have fizzled out almost as quickly as the chorus of criticism rose.yet she didn t  and here we all are.
i remember a case where an anime called  hachimitsu to clover  had the male va changed for the protagonist in the 2nd season due to the original va hospitalized. the 2nd male va was ok  but sounded different enough in the tv broadcast that eventually the production team brought back the original va  who has recovered  to voice the protagonist for the dvd release of the 2nd season.
@xiaoyuuu  it s not about their ability to sound  young  or whatever nonsense you ve misconstrued by my comment. i m talking about the actor s decorum. honestly i find more nonsensical controversy from western va s than from japan s. from throwing other english va s under the bus due to their political leanings or just overall being horrible twatwaffles outside of their voiced persona. and some to this day have never apologized for their actions and continue on with their tirades and never faced real repercussions.and i will be remiss if i say japanese va s are infallible. look up seiyuu controversies. only difference is  one screw up in japan s va industry can assuredly set them back so badly  they never work again.
@xiaoyuuu ashley sounded like a bratty school girl in the original i dont think she could sound any younger
@james bee  weeb  you say  way to sound like a tool. japanese seiyuu are a big deal compared to the u.s. this is objective fact. very different culture and industry there concerning this stuff. higher standards. the voice actor also shares in the blame. how can a lackluster performance be allowed to even come out of them and be considered acceptable  there s more than one party at fault  but the va is hardly absolved. after all  her performance is what was ultimately delivered when she could have nipped that in the bud to begin with and done a better job by not reading the script like a damn monotone bot. the production team also could ve done something about it  but clearly they didn t address the issue or didn t do so well enough and decided this is what they were gonna ship and here we are.
but seriously  they couldn t find a better non-union va for ada  did they even hold auditions for the role  and if they did  you expect me to believe that this is the best they could do no one in production bothered to correct her performance  cause if this is the best they could do then that s just sad. also  if she hopefully gets another chance to voice ada i hope she shows improvement. if the dlc thing is coming that s a great opportunity for her to redeem her performance. but if there s barely any difference in the output  capcom might as well drop her and look for another va.
@holymoly  i m confident lily probably hoped on the audition bus right off the bat because she s a fan. unpopular opinion  but her performance could ve been meant to make ada more calm and laid back and only showing emotion around leon when she tries to tease him  a bit.
@xiaoyuuu  seems like y all care about more racial pandering instead of true talent tho
it has something to do with the culture. i ve seen plenty japanese vas taking the hit because their voice acting were subpar in a show  but most of the time they would stay quiet unless severe harassments were involved. since the va industry in japan is highly competitive  if one s performance are not doing great they ll most likely quit after certain period because they could not land on a major role  and only the best vas got to stay. they speak with their acting skills and not with their political alignments. american vas on the other hand are highly sensitive to criticisms and will often go ballistic because a few people are attacking them based on their appearances. while this may solve the bullying issues  temporarily   it won t do much for their self-improvement though.
meh the catwoman voice is corny it was time for a change.
mediocre is giving her voice acting way too much credit  she sounds like she s trying to do an impression of data from the next generation but with way less emotion and hes literally an android.  im definitely disappointed with both the va and capcom but more with gao  she didnt even freakin try  like this game is huge re4 originally was huge and she cant even give the decency to simply try to voice it well  and now shes hiding from critics  im so disappointed in her
i loved the original. i ve played it many times on many different consoles starting with the ps2  the most recent one being vr. it is my favorite game of all time. her voice didn t even register as an issue. they wanted a much more serious retelling of the story and as many times as the original was  remastered   no one wanted the exact same story over again. leon becomes battle hardened and changed in those six years since the outbreak  why not her  it will never hold up to the original  but all considered  it was a masterpiece.
@star rain  thank you  i concur. i loved the original  it was my favorite game of all time. it will always be there on the many consoles it was remastered and released on. nobody wanted an exact replication of the original. these remakes are aimed to be a much more serious telling of the story. i didn t even register her voice as an issue until i started seeing the internet bitching about it as they will always do. this remake of the game was phenomenal
@aaron p.  dude  she sounds like a robot though  she has no inflections in her voice at all  it can be more serious without having a voice as emotionless as a robot
@aaron p.  amen.
@d00mguy9000  her voice was never emotionless she had said her voice lines fast asf and there s times where her delivery can sound dry a bit but practically everything is fine  you people on the internet are just too blinded by the nostalgia of the original re games to the point that anything in the remake makes you wanna bitch abt something if you don t like the voice stop playing the game and get atta here it s that simple
@            explain why i think the guy who played leon was superb  why do i think ashley was brilliant  krauser was not the best but it had emotion and he did a good job considering the inflections are there  hunnigan did great. gao was dogwater  her voice was dry  emotionless  i ve seen more emotion from spock
@d00mguy9000  there s no point in the video game where ada sounded emotionless she was either cold or professional nowhere near emotionless did she had some dry delivery lines   sure but she was nkt emotionless at all the only reason why you saying it is bc your biased against the original game name 1 scene in the video game that made her sound emotionless your too use to the seductive voice of ada to the point your just not use to the different voice it s called you being biased
@            either way  if they come out with separate ways dlc  her voice is so bad that i have no interest in playing it if i have to listen to her voice the entire game  i m good on that  no thanks.
@d00mguy9000  her voice is not at all bad she s neutral not good nor bad she s normal but needs more practice u just not use to the voice
@            i don t want to get use to the voice  i want the voice to be good i don t want to have to get used to it lol
@d00mguy9000  not everything is gonna be good at the first start give it time and you ll eventually get use to it and won t have much of a problem with it i was the same with a few other va s or so from different games overtime i started getting normal for it
she doesn t have to sound seductive tbh  she is a femme fatale but cold asf  the uninterested and cold approach is something new and not bad at all
@jes s rodr guez guerrero  thank you finally someone understands
@abyssx13 she had her shot to impress us and failed. if the first impression was terrible i don t want to hear her voice again  it s not a case about getting used to it.
@jes s rodr guez guerrero  if 10 voice actresses voiced her previously in that seductive manner and no one was complaining about nothing then it means it was the right step everytime. why tf would bring this mediocre performance to a great remake is something i don t understand.
op took the replies a bit hard lol
jolene anderson didn t give ada s voice a seductive personality either  she sounds very generic. i am with melonie in that one.
@pat james dan ikr the previous vas didn t get any harassment or whatsoever because they did their job well and executed performance well to fit into the character. the new va is just so bad  it s a fact
@quartza_  thank you. tell these morons in the comments.
@            you re just sugarcoating it. also no it has nothing to do with nostalgia or change. if something is bad then we will call it out. you newer fans accept mediocracy so easily and have such low standards. you always think new is better. see it s not fun when it happens to you.
@limited  no it s not that she failed you just don t like the voice it s terrible in your opinion quit acting like everyone thinks the same as you
@mugetsu tenshou  i do agree i was projecting that i am only speaking facts. absolutely  i agree that there are opinions and i respect them. i wrote this comment in the heat of the moment and i was angry that s all. i just wanted the best for us  gamers. if it has offended you in any way. i am sorry. i didn t mean to. some people actually do like this performance but majority don t and i hope capcom gets the clear message. peace out.
exactly  how she handles criticisms is so bad. she left that anti white privilege post which is got nothing to do towards her bas acting performance. she shouldn t take the role if she can t imitate the character s voice because it seems she just talks with her own voice not acting it out
@quartza_  this. that s something i really appreciated fo courtney taylor after sally cahill. she didn t just voice ada. she actually sounds as ada instead of having ada sounding like her.
i think part of the problem is they needed to amp up the volume on lily s voice. the volume is too low in contrast to the other characters.
i love her acting tbh but i didn t meet the old ada. i think she brought some seriousness to the story. glad i only care about my current experience
i honestly think that capcom is trying to make it the new resident evil titles and remakes less gimmicky. my opinion the original ada voice was to exaggerated. most of the old re games were scary when playing them but when you get to a cutscene it just becomes a comedy horror. plus in re4 remake you didn t see ada as much so you didn t have much time to adjust since her voice is very different. it s not the worst resident evil voice acting. look at all of leon s lines in the original. sorry not every game can be red dead 2
you re right  she s supposed to be a femme fatale. problem is with the kinds of people who gave her the acting direction  if not lily herself  is that they probably don t even know what a femme fatale is actually supposed to be like. their mind more than likely just goes  oh  strong woman!  and thinks girl boss.
as a guy who played many re games  original re4 included   i did notice how tone deaf gao s performance was almost to a monotone sense. i get that ada wong is somewhat suppose to be a cold calculating character  but many of her lines just came out as if she was - once again - tone deaf. overall  the remake was entertaining at least as i got to play a classic that was redone with some new angles. regardless  whenever it comes to ada wong in re4  i will always say this team ashley especially this new version of her
i think behavior chose vicky psarakis because she s a canadian and the lead singer of the agonist. metal band from montreal which is also where behavior is stationed. i love her band and was kind of excited that she was going to voice ada. and considering that dead by daylight isn t resident evil cannon  i didn t have much invested in ada s voice being identical to the franchises past games. while i ll admit that i was disappointed that jolene andersen didn t reprise her role in resident evil 4. lily gao didn t bother me that much. it was definitely a step down and i do agree with your criticisms. the only thing that bothers me is the fact that they only cast her because she was asian. not because she had a voice that embodied the character as fans have grown to know her.jolene andersen was my personal favorite. she seemed to humanize ada more and made her feel less like an arch type. i always thought ada coming off as this character who could ve easily fit in the 007 universe came off as really cheesy. it worked back in the day. just didn t age well for me i suppose.
ok sally was the rendition i liked hearing and up to re6 i thought that was fine  but sadly dbd i didn t know the character had many lines of dialog other then getting whomped by the killer xd. as for re2 remake i felt that the va was giving off the  im being and fbi bitch with authority  vibe which i was thinking was fine as everyone had such changes in personality. the example would be like marvin when he put more emphasis about not hesitating when seeing the zombies than a whole dialogue like he was narrating the story. i would have said that he could have mentioned the other s.t.a.r.s. members but they chose to make it about leon and his first bad day. i have only seen the one cutscene of ada and luis chatting and thought it was the same va but still playing the the  bitch attitude  though after hearing the dialogue i would have wished sally came back  i don t know if she passed away or not into va stuff anymore . i will say that its capcom that should be clowned about this than the va seeing as today s social mindset is  attack the vas who are only doing their job as directed.  than getting on capcom who made the decisions on who voices who. i have been enjoying re 4 remake and luis is ok though i miss his  ballistics  comment despite this version is to be a much more serious and anger like tone.
i m going to be honest i think the fault is more on capcom then her  i feel like capcom wanted to distance itself from ada being the femme fatale trope  she is less flirty and more professional in this  where in og ada was wrapping leon around her finger but also keeping him at juuuust enough distance to pull one over him  in this it feels like she while on a misson is also using the whole incident as almost like try-outs for leon to see if he is worth recruiting into hcf
i think the problem is the direction  not the voice actor. she was great on the expanse tv show.
you re right. criticism should be directed to voice casting and director. saying that  i don t know if she listened to her predecessors and got what they brought to the role. she can t make any changes. that s the company. and  no  you couldn t play ada wong  but i do like listening to you. may god continue to bless you and keep you safe.
what people don t understand is that the remake ada is no longer following the femme fatale trope just as the remake leon ditched the flirty side of the og leon. they must understand that these characters have been reimagined in a way to do away with the cliche. one can tell based on re2r that these remake characters are now taking a rather different direction from their og portrayals. if ada in re4r was really supposed to be seductive sounding  then that should have already been the case in re2r but it s not so...
i actually really like her voice. i think it s just the delivery that was lacking. just some coaching to get the right performance i think.
i would give her criticism about the quality of her voice acting for who the character is  but that s really about it.sometimes  when i want to put on a show a basically something like for example  imperfect cell from dragon ball z and put on a show for vic mignogna once that way. for voice acting it s more than just doing the voice. it s trying to put yourself into the shoes of that character at any given moment.unless you have a very vivid imagination it s something that takes work to do on a dime. like samuel l jackson said once he had imaginary friends as a kid and he utilized it. same type of concept for va.
i think it s a mixture of things she was clearly missed cast as ada. the voice director didn t do a great job. leon and louis were great  ashley was fine  but i wasn t a fan of anyone else really and the mixing of the audio for her most of the time wasn t great either  sometimes imo it just sounded like her audio was recorded in a different studio to the others that wasn t set up properly  it really gave me bad fan live action scetches that people use to make on youtube
performance was bad  but she doesn t deserve backlash. it s not her fault she got hired  shouldn t catch flack for trying to do her job. whoever was in charge of casting goofed big time.
i came to the video because i agree and then i realized wait... melonie... melonie s voice .... why was i even here again  ok ok  i m kidding. it s mostly because we just got an awesome va from jolene last. ada went from hot to not with lily. i remember being a claire-bear fan and hating all the typical ada worship from the past. but ada from re2remake made me a believer. and some of the mods  like ada s naughty prison girl outfit.... mamma mia!! lolol
courtney taylor did a really good job for ada s character  especially for timeline  she was mysterious and sexy.jolene anderson s version was very refreshing and human  also match the timeline.
i would say gao sounds flat  aside from the seductiveness or whatever. a lot of the other actresses had tone and inflection which aided in making ada a character that felt real. i m glad you played them all together and gave some insight  spot on melonie.
she sounded so excited to see leon . i would love to hear you try a femme fatale voice sometime
it s not really her fault as a voice actress this could be probably the fault with the voice direction this issue happens in a lot of games. a prime example of voice direction gone wrong is xenoblade chronicles 2 where the cast weren t even shown cutscenes from the game when they went in to record the voices according to the voice actress for pyra.
i think you hit the nail on the head. they wanted to change ada and picked the voice they wanted. she gave them the performance they wanted and was paid. most of the people  criticizing  her are going after her because she is an individual and not a company. an individual will usually give the type of reaction they are looking for. a company will just throw out a pr statement and forget about it. also  since she limited her instagram account  i am sure some of the people are pretty proud of themselves and thinking  look what i just did .
what did you think of wesker
@frank kennedy  seemed alright.
yes  her being cast sounded ok to me contrary to the dead by daylight sample heard.but it was very flat and emotionless  the opposite of what most va would do unless they get specific instructions to act this way  and that s the role of the voice over director to tell how a character should be interpreted and be felt.
unfortunately acting skills do not translate 1 to 1 to voice acting. with acting  you can convey emotion through your body and mannerisms as well as voice. with va work  it s purely voice.
yea she sounded like she recorded on a cheap mic.
not to mention the director.
like bawkbasoup the re speed runner said you can criticize the va but the blame fully goes to the casting director who hired her
voicing a character is giving it its personality. the difference between acting and voice acting is that you cannot change your voice  and you have to be chosen by how your voice sounds first  and then by how good of an act you put with that voice. its sad but it is what it is. voice actors have to be chosen by how they sound  just like if you are looking for a perfect face match to play a live action version  which obviously hollywood is bad at this too  on purpose ebcause fmnnsmm . this new ada wong is bad because her voice sounds like a truck driver s  yet she didn t put a bad performance in the tone  she tried  but it also does look like she is not a professional voice actress  and there you go  she was only chosen because diversity  because she is asian  and because she acted as ada wong on that awful resident evil movie nobody wants to see ever again.
the original re4 voice acting had some camp to it s va while the game did as well. i loved almost all of the vas  minus ashley  in the original and they simply fit the tone of it.now re4 remake i noticed that they removed some of the camp and it had a slightly more serious tone to it. which again i felt all their voices simply matched the tone of it so i m not really bothered by it. the va i really wished they brought back was paul mercier who was leon in the original. dude was perfect. the new leon va was alright though.
capcom voice directors are responsible. i thought when re4 remake was announced that the characters voice actors would carry over. not the case completely. she didn t do all that bad but not what i expected.
social media makes it way too easy for people to be incredibly disrespectful towards others.  how many people would say that to her face
the soul of the og doesnt feel like its there in the remake  incredible what they have but the cheesy jokes  the voices  the lines are what made me love the original f in the chat for the dumb ballistics line or rain or shine youre going down because serious serious 24 7 serious
i ll also add that in the japanese vo ada does sound seductive and flirty in her lines and capcom and the devs are japanese so they clearly had a better handle on the voice direction for the japanese version. i really dislike ada s english vo but i d blame the localization team and the voice director for giving her line reads a pass.
i m a simple man  i ve just been enjoying a mostly excellent remake of a fantastic game! perhaps ada s voice work wasn t perfect  but that never deterred me from enjoying the overall game!
seriously different game  different ada voice  capcom does need to pick one. according to behind the voice actors this is gao s first role  and i do believe it was a mistake to play ada wong  especially considering she was unprepared for the back lash  but even as someone who apparently couldn t tell good voice acting  from bad if they booth had neon signs every time i heard them  i d argue her voice acting was mid. but i would also argue that s more the director s fault than hers.
i have similar criticisms of her voice work. it would be great for another character who is a more serious spy or operative  but ada is like leon s catwoman love interest  it s been a part of their thing since original re 2. i never played umbrella chronicles but it gets referenced a lot. megan hollingshead does sound like a younger ada.i don t dislike gao  but there are times that she shows she can pull it off if she made the effort. sally cahill is the best voice  but it was 20 years ago  so next best would be re 2 remake ada. i d also never criticize the actress directly  she should have had better direction  also can the gaming and animation industries get their heads off of citical race theory nonsense a voice is a voice. phil lamarr is great was samurai jack  a black man who played a japanese samurai  and played mgs 2 s vampire boss. i got similar issues with the changes to krauser.
when it comes to voice acting the first people and possibly only to blame are the writers and the voice director.
a true masterpiece lily gao...
my brother and i loved this game for the gamecube  i was telling him that i was playing the remake and was telling him how much i was loving it but my biggest problem was ada s voice. i toll him i would that maybe it would grow on me.. just beat the game and nope... not at all.
i know this is super corny but i don t care lol  you have like the most beautiful voice  face  and soul of anyone i ve known. just remember the hate for you is irrelevant  the support and love you get from us and god overshadows it all. love the video as always  just keep being you! have an awesome day!
i don t know why people blame the voice actor. i m sure she had to be vetted  selected and then  they wouldn t have taken the first lines she spoke and called it done. there were people in charge who decided what made it into the game. i wasn t too thrilled by the voice acting for ada either but to say it s her fault is a bit much. for all we know  the feedback they gave her might have lead to the final product we got. or maybe it s a story thing i know some weird stuff happens to her in later installments so maybe they are trying to get something set up  wishful thinking .
i actually liked her performance  english voice actors for these games do both the voice and motion capture  and i felt she was burned out  and didnt need to put up the fa ade of femme fatale  and sound like she s making fun of leon with every line  her body language was far more interesting than on the remake of 2  that could just be technology and have nothing to do with her ... and while residnet evil isnt exactly the place to take characters too seriously  she feels more grounded and confident  which i did like  but i see how others would not.what i didnt like was neither the harassment she got  even if her performance was horrible... and i also didnt like that her takeaway of it is  white privilege . still she didnt deserve the hate.
to be honest this game ada sounds more sad and depressed because she is being forced by wesker to get the las plagas sample.i think she did fine in this story even though she could of been a bit more playful
i loved her voice.
she does deserve the criticism. while her voice may not naturally match the femme fatale style  there s a lot you can do to train your voice to make it match the role you re going for. and besides that  the voice work is just bad. she sounds uninterested  like she s reading the lines for the first time. but instead of taking the criticism  she deletes it and hides behind a race shield.
btw  there s already someone who used her original re4 voice to recreate her lines and hopefully turn it into a mod.
ever since the star wars prequels i ve been less willing to blame actors for their performances and put the blame on the director instead. the va director should have known this was a bland performance and asked for another take to correct it. if this actress wasn t capable of giving the desired take  then the fault lays with the casting director. think about it. for this performance to reach the game s final cut  the va director had to either say it was good enough or direct her to perform this way in the first place. the buck stops with the director in either case.
they always had that dynamic  and still that sally ladys ada is even better than the japanese one.
i might have to switch over to jp voices for my second playthrough.  and especially for seperate ways.
re4 remake was written in english
it just ruined every scene with ada for me  but thankfully many of her scenes from the original were cut. it s almost like they knew how awful it was so they had a lot of her dialogue cut.no way am i buying an ada dlc with that voice  it absolutely would ruin that for me. hopefully the backlash will cause a casting change for ada  but i doubt it. as immersion breaking as it might be having 2 separate voices for her in the same game  i d gladly take that over more of this one.
@jack m  i think there is something wrong with you if you don t buy games based off of a voice. maybe narrative experiences or visual novels would be more your jam if you are so troubled by a few minutes of dialogue.
it literally ruined every scene she as in with how bad she sounded.
@noodles . he said the dlc.  not the game!there is something really wrong with your reading comprehension skills.
that s it  cat woman and batman dynamic. 10000  that s what it is. both play hard to get..but clearly  they really like each other.
@a cute lil  mint  yeah! she even does the right thing because he sorta turns her in that direction.seems to help him when it s not in her business interest to  and he will rescue her.
aw thank you so much for the kind words  god bless
@melonie mac go boom  you re always welcome.
can you tell where we can get the mod
i m sure they will  too bad i only have ps5 so skipping every scene with ada is my only solution. thankfully the number of scenes she s in has been cut down significantly  it s like they knew it was terrible so they limited her dialogue to as little as possible.
@bolter24  unfortunately it s not a mod yet
@jack m  if you have a pc  get it once it s cheaper to enjoy it whole game. i m sure the game is fun and all  so try not to let lily gao s performance ruin your fun
modders  doing gods work.
@mad maxine  life is strange
voice acting is one part of the roadblock production   you can t  blame an actor for his role being bad  or the movie being terrible  you have to look at the direction  the director  the budget  casting  equipment etccriticism doesn t equal to harrasment and if people don t stop that mindset they will regret it later. it doesn t matter if you did it online  and use anonymity  you will still pay for your foul acts.
yeah honestly i think its more fair to take the complaints to capcom since it was really the voice directors who approved of this performance  to me she was doing her job and while criticism is warranted 100   that is not an excuse to start harassing her to the point where she just doesn t feel safe.
i look at it simply as they kept the japanese voice actress from the re2 remake in japan and for the english language version they kept the leon actor from re2 as well but for some strange reason didn t even contact the actress who played ada in that game  the only conclusion i can make is sadly one of a casting due to identity politics and no other reason
apparently she played ada in that one movie that crashed and burned recently.
the performance wasn t horrible but it did sound pretty bad  especially when compared to the rest of the voice cast. i really tried to like it. i didn t mind the shift to a deeper voice at all  but it s about the delivery. there s a fine line between sounding cool  calm and collected and sounding bored  flat and monotonous and unfortunately remake ada was the latter. there were some lines that really stuck out to me as particularly poorly delivered  the boat ride scene and the final chapter . remake had insanely high expectations and there are so many excellent vas out there so i m quite baffled as to why they chose this one. some blame the sound mixing and directions given but the fact that what we got is presumably the best audio recorded and that more assistance instructions were necessary makes me believe she simply isn t the best fit for ada. of course  that doesn t mean you go harassing the va on her social media  nor is she beyond fair criticism   but feedback should be directed to capcom so they know people aren t happy and can improve on it. and the media reports aren t really helping because it s coming off like she doesn t deserve criticism at all.
agreed  directing all the criticism at the actor is unwarranted  but yes within reason some should be. she ll never improve at her job without some. but the stronger criticism should be directed at capcom  so they can fix things going forward.
oh wow  i really didn t know what to expect and then when you played it i was really shocked by how it didn t fit the character at all.
lily gao seems to have more of a blunt but cryptic voice and could potentially do one for jill after wesker brainwashed her. she either doesn t have the right voice for ada or the director should have coached her better on set. but i don t think lilly should have voice acted ada like that.
i didn t mind at all how she sounded  what i miss was her flirtatious  demeanor towards leon.  her voice is incredibly sultry she just was not saying the right words.  do we know who wrote the lines for her to speak
lily gao s voice is so chill  like it
thanks for the video while you are still working through life stuff!  we will still be here
she was great in the expanse  certainly can act. miscast or misdirected here imo. is this yet another case of the people producing things not giving a damn about the source material also  what s supposed to be wrong with your voice  melonie  that is the larger mystery from this episode as far as i m concerned!
after hearing the voice acting from other ada vas  i finally realized how terrible lily gao s voice acting is.  but  really  fans should criticize capcom for allowing lily gao to be the va for ada. hope they can fix that in a future update.
the thing that gets me the most about ada s re4r voice is the lack of quality compared to everyone else. she sounds like her audio was recorded via phone. her delivery... i ve definitely heard better  but it s not dead by daylight so i m whatever about it. it won t stop me from sleeping.
looking forward to ai voice generation and how gaming companies will write up voice actor contracts in the future. these union vs. non-union voice acting pay dispute shenanigans is tedious and drags the whole medium down. just how cheap these gaming companies can be reminds me of david hayter  solid snake s voice actor  forfeiting half his paycheck to bring back the original cast for the twin snakes.
i don t understand why so many people hate her voice. i like the new ada voice a lot!
capcom should be criticized  not gao  they are the ones that cast her  they are the ones that signed off on her  performance
the game was so good! glad i made it my first play through on my youtube channel!
whatever people think of her performance  capcom was well aware of it before it was released.whether they don t care  or its the direction they want to take her character i ll leave up to you to decide  but it is clearly intentional.
i liked her voice. different strokes for different folks.
yup  and to no surprise  leon in re4r sounds really good! it s like nick apostolides did his homework and saw how leon  voice changed from re4 to re6  and knew how to insert himself to fit the timeline.
really appreciate the support  thank you
i agree it works with the more serious tone of the game.
@manoz she got to the buisness fare and square and i love her 3 minute performence in welcome to raccoon city. she actually captivated her perfectly which is something paul ws anderson failed miserably upon by using a chinese actress with the obvious accent that ada wong never had to begin with. residentg evil retribution is a fun movie but its certaintly was another crapfest just like most of pauls movies of resuident evil are. although his first 3 movies did great  after that he really f@cked it up with more sequels flat out disrespecting the characters of resident evil. the only 2 characters he got right was jill valentine and albert wesker. anyways i hate how pathetic these group of fans are regarding her voice acting. i agree it wasnt the best but they literetly scared her off she s already new to the industry people need to learn when to give those a chance even though their voice acting isnt freshed out for the character  you never bully nor harrass them all because they  voiced the characters. they arent in charge of the game their just getting paid to voice them. lily gao s drop dead gorgeous she s truly a knockout of a goddess she best suits ada wong in the live action movies and i hope that movies given sequels. idc what boomers and degenerates think of the movie  it wasnt fantastic but it was a fair resident evil picture while i was annoyed how they switched up a few of the characters races  its still a farely good movie in comparision to the other live action films paul ws anderson crapped out and humiliating the franchise with his stupid writing skills.
you are exactly perfect for who you are. great content. i am from england and i like the way you talk. it makes me smile in a nice way!
looking at her credits it doesn t even look like she s done video games before. i dont know for re4 remake but in re8 the voice actors were also doing the motion capture. just something to keep in mind  if lily gao was also the motion capture for ada s animations she very well could have just been out of her element leading to a pretty wooden voice. who knows maybe she was more focused on getting movements right. perhaps she would have been better off dubbing over herself post-motion capture.
ada showed up to gather intel  part of figuring out what was going on was questioning others. when leon showed a bit of mental fortitude  she became seductive. to try and get leon to be  comfortable  enough to tell her all the stuff she wanted to know.when this didn t work out the way she wanted  she tried flirting with him. when that didn t work  she tried setting him up to fail  get deleted .when that didn t work  she found a friend. very similar to xavier and magneto s friendship.
i think it s the voice directors fault for approving it not necessarily lily s fault.
people are allowed to criticise what is an extremely indifferent voice performance. nobody has provided any receipts for bullying  and even if such receipts could be produced  they would not reflect in any way upon the people who provided legitimate criticism  which i assume number in the vast majority. moreover  gao s twitter stunt was extremely performative - and if she didn t deserve bullying for her performance  then she certainly deserved bullying for that!
i m normally pretty critical of bad voice work so it s kind of odd that i find myself in the position of not thinking the performance was all that bad. i guess if i m really scrutinizing it i can hear that it s a bit on the monotone side of things  but it really didn t bother me. i guess because i ve always found the dialogue and delivery in these games to be pretty corny  i just don t have high expectations anyway  and as long as a re game has the atmosphere and gameplay right  i m happy
i heard that the previous ada actress from re2 remake is a union actress and the re4 actress is non-union. i don t know if that means capcom cheaped out  i still haven t played the game though as i ll wait for a price drop  not because of the va performance . however i don t think the actress deserves so much harassments. actors do the best they can and sometimes their performances land and other times not.
it seems like capcom wanted to play down the seductive temptress angle to her character  which probably went into the voice direction. she sounds like she s just there to do her job in the game.
she sounded like she was trying to do raven s voice but as long as she was fujiko i didn t mind at all. her  flirting with leon was fun to listen too
if i was in charge  i would have hired ming na wen. i think she is perfect for ada.
i didn t think her voice over was horrible  but it was definitely a step down from jolene andersen s performance in the re2 remake  which was perfect. i wonder why they didn t just use her again
i was like... is that rhonda rousey   her voice thew me off guard. like everyone was acting like it was a b rated horror film which i don t mind...and then this masculine ada voice had me like...is there someone else behind her sounding like that  nope it s her.
often times  lousy voice-overs can be attributed to poor vocal direction  as opposed to said deliverer being a  bad voice actor . in all likelihood  the stilted delivery from ada wong in this particular iteration of re4 was not gao s fault.the first two bloodrayne games featured absolutely atrocious voice acting from the lead character.  however  in subsequent high profile games  laura baily demonstrated herself to be excellent at her job  and in all likelihood  the preliminary disasters of her vocal career can be attributed to lousy voice direction  as opposed to anything for which she can be ascribed fault.
we need a re4 remake remake with jolene andersen as ada.
you re not terrible melonie. you re one of the best people i know. and god is blessing you.
criticisms were valid. however  the blame is ultimately capcoms  they re the one that chose her in auditions  coached her on the voice they wanted  and mixed the audio. i m always from the camp that nobody is a bad worker - it s just that they haven t found the right role yet
previous ada voice actor joined union.capcom don t like union and they cost a lot. so they hire different va for low cost.i like both voices. remake ada voice turns me on a bit
i really like your point of view on this.  good video!yes i have a bad voice too  i m not a voice actor either
i like your voice melonie! it s well suited for your type of content!
she just read the lines  but going after her is not the way to do things.
connections as usual.if they wanted asian  why not that lady that did mulan  amy fiturama.. she s a vet  even lucy liu
strange thing is that i believe a porn star did the mocap for ashley.  not sure if she did the voice too.
@finalhalo3  i would think a porn star has better body articulation than the average person lmao. that d be a smart person to go to for mocap.
ada is not modeled after lily gao  so no way is she involved with her motion capture.
what  twitter stunt
@ranzudezu  i mistyped that  sorry. i meant her instagram stunt of deleting her content.
@captain thunderbolt  oh okok ahaha
yup nerds are gonna nerd.
same here. it fits  it just wasn t sultry enough.
@xiaoyuuu  thats corny theres no reason for her to be sultry.
@star rain   there actually is. that was the original vision of how ada should sound. what would that be corny in the first place  feeling smart for using that word
@seven  well yeah the original res are literally famous for bad corny voice acting thats why its super-refreshing for capcom to finally put in some work!
i said on another video that with that deep voice she d be perfect for nemesis  lol. staaaaaaaars!
some people are saying capcom is non-union...that is so cheap if it is true
the voice casting is the problem  her voice is too deep and just doesn t fit ada at all. i seriously doubt any direction could make that voice sound good for ada.
@jack m  voice direction can have a much bigger influence on the quality of the voice-overs than any lack-of-skill of the actors themselves.this is one of the reasons why such reputable individuals like kris zimmerman is in such demand  as she tends to get the best quality out of actors she administrates.some of those same actors have participated in other products with different directors  and oftentimes the results of the voice-overs has been considerably poorer.
amen to that!
yessir!
looking for someone defrnding her  she sounds like a completely normal person to me.
this is what happens when companies put identity before talent.
back in my day ada made you ask  is she trying to sleep with me or kill me or maybe both   new ada sounds like a cashier you vaguely know.
i can see the future now  no more vas because they will be afraid to be bullied for the work they are hired for. game characters in the future will just communicate through text box. everyone will be happy
our voices contain a little bit of iur culture no matter where we are born or where we are raised.  it seems kind of obvious that capcom chose gao just because she s asian  and not expensive  and in some of her lines you can actually hear her inflection.  growing up playing the games. i tried to hear  for lack of a better term  the  asian inflection  and never could. so i  would look up who the voice actors were only to findthat they are just white people.. they sound amazing but they didn t have that  inflection  that i was missing. when i first saw agents of shield and i saw ming-na wen playing melinda may. all i could think about was that s ada wong. she has the bass the confidence in her tone the  inflection
fair criticism. good job mel. great video.
ohh.. i like megan hollingshead s take on ada s voice. i also heard about this issue but didn t mind it. but as compared side to side  it kinda sounds that lily gao s version seems bit detached  less confident but still pushy vibe to it. that s just my opinion
the worst part is the  oh leon  it sounded not like ada  but from a different person saying that.
she didn t. she s just doing her job. and with that i appreciate her effort.
this is why for video games or animation  you should bother with casting based solely on race.you need to find the right  sound  for the character. tone  inflections  etc...not only that  but this is an existing character and you should try to always have the core sound  voice  to be similar each time as people were already told what the character should sound like in previous games  in this case.but yes  this isn t the voice actress  fault  it is the voice director and capcom themselves for not picking up on this or just neglecting it altogether.
definitely not productive taking it to lily gao personally. it really does make more sense to take it to capcom directly if they feel that strongly about it.
lily gao was just doing her job and it sucks that people take their criticism to the next level  yes we all know that ada wong is female  fatale and she s has sultry seductive voice but i believe it s the writing of direction that capcom was going with which was ada wong being more serious and mysterious. i m okay with ada not being flirty it s like it made the remake bad but anyway upset fans should ve went after cc with their complaints instead of lily gao social media.
i m so confused lol  why did they have a different va for umbrella chronicles than darkside chronicles  they had the same actress for 2   and 4  then changed for umbrella chronicles but then changed back for darkside  that is so strange to me.
someone used ai to give fans a taste of what she should ve sounded like
as many have already said   it s not a great performance   but that falls on the director first   the producer next.  if you have an actor who does a bad job   as a director you need to bring the best out of the actor. if that happened and we still have this performance  then the producers are responsible to say  what can we do to salvage this   who can we bring in to redub this   this was more of a failure on the upper levels primarily.
og ada voice actor has that very seductive  mature women in virgin s dream  factor.lily gao s voice is more to the  ice cold your highness  sound it s like from a power hierarchy that treat you like a dog.her voice is not bad  it s just doesn t fit into to the role
she doesn t deserve the backlash  the casting director deserves it.she just wasn t a good fit for ada unfortunately. this is what happens when you try to match the race of characters to the voice actors.  the best person regardless of skin tone should get the job.she shouldn t have got the job.
the voiceactress bears some of the responsibility for the bad performance  but a lot is the director s as well.
i think for me it was about the lack of  consistency with her vas from re2 remake to re4. i love the og ada va but the va from re2 remake did a  good job  which was who i was expecting to play in the new re4. hearing gao s delivery just threw me off because she lacked depth and didn t have that hint of femme fatale. if anything shouldn t we really be upset with capcom and not the va
the way i see it  if someone isn t prepared to say something to someone else s face then they shouldn t say it on social media. especially to a complete stranger. i can t stand how easy it has become for people to hide behind their online identity and behave in a way they never would out in the real world  other than the nutcases who have no self-control   or personal accountability .
in fairness  a sultry voice delivery is generally something that has to be intentionally fostered and practiced.my first girlfriend had the sexy talk and flirtation down to such a science that every girl i dated after her was a complete let down in that department. i have become completely disillusioned.here i thought chicks did stuff like practice being sexy in the mirror or something.next y all gonna tell me you don t have lingerie pillow fight slumber parties either.
sadly no one notice the rce swap of ingrid hannigan  from a caucasian brunette to a poc like morrison in dmc 5. capcom is giving esg memo since 2020.
isnt ada wong an asian character....
@norman readdis  yeah  tencent became a major stakeholder that year too. i think japanese companies mostly do it like -in japanese version they do it their way.-english version they obey esg s  woke  ideology.
@argent wolf tencent was squenix s consultant partner since 2018 till this day. and squenix is now an official esg company. capcom and bandai namco is giving  diversity inclusion memo since 2020  it has been leaked. even if i say it people have a tendency of memory lost and are easily subjected ro overton window. so what s the point. humans do create their own demons. and we ll see who s going to complain when it s too late.
@norman readdis  although hunnigan s voice didn t sound that bad in comparison to ada and specially cause hunnigan is a small role.
@onerbot that doesn t justify the change. just because it s a  small role . imagine if they change lieutenant marvin branagh to a samoan islander because it s just a  small role  and some of them are literally the same skin tone. pretty sure they ll never do that and activists are going to be up in arms.
@norman readdis  they did that cause ada is a bigger role yes  they wanted representation for ada while for hunnigan it didn t matter in the end just hire a professional voice actor actress and it s all good.
@onerbot they did what  i don t know what is the point of the argument.
@norman readdis  i mean you can change a voice actor to someone that portrays that characters ethnicity  but only do that if that new voice actor is actually good.
@onerbot yes but they didn t need to culturally appropriate the character. this is like velma or other race swap characters just to compliment the va mostly. black vas.
lol i heard it like who is this
the  leon s. kennedy   was the worst to me.
probably she wasn t available. ada s role was very minor for uc. so  probably sally had something better to voice at the moment.
link
i was just joking about this  go figure it would be done by someone.
@w o9pz e4i   . just search re4 remake ada with re4 original  or re6 voice.
i think she did amazing and captured the professional  cold-blooded mercenary role perfectly. this is also her second time playing ada wong.
one thing you need to remember here is that people have a right to leave criticism as they are paying customers notice that no one is complaining about the game there complaining about her performance not who or what she is i believe it s both her and capcoms fault for not realising there fan base and how drastic of a change it is i mean what was the reason the changed voice actors because the last one isn t asian! no one gives a fuck who does what work just do the work good it s that simple
i actually watch because i like your voice  i guess everyone has their own opinions
btw im german and in the german game the voice is luckely really well done and has the seductive tone.
the thing about ada s previous va s is that they all sound somewhat similar  with a few small differences and nuances.whereas lily gao sticks out like a sore thumb because her voice acting is nowhere near similar to the previous va s.not her fault though. the blame lies with the people doing the casting.they should ve gone with a va that is reminiscent of the previous ones.
there is some hope that an executive at capcom literally just thought to themselves  we need bad voice acting in re  for the nostalgia
at the end of the day  it s all down to ones opinion. i personally felt she did fine. you know who else felt she did fine  the ones who directed her as she delivered her lines. at anytime they could ve told her that she wasn t what they were looking for and the game might ve been postponed  but then we wouldn t be having this discussion.... probably. and like you said  it s totally fine to say you don t like something  but don t go directly to the actress. tell it to capcom.
no she don t deserve this.fact capcom also removed many iconic scenes from remake itself.voice acting and new model for remake good but removing old scenes like leon ada s first meeting fight is bad idea.
the online piling is unnecessary   but lily gao s voice acting here is clearly substandard. an actor might tell you her breathing is bad - she seems to be running out of air near the end of the lines   with the volume simply fading out near the end. her volume   timing   emphasis is monotonous   which results in a lack of emotional resonance to her line reading. there s no way the casting director   voice director during recording did not know this. i suppose the people in charge either did not know the importance of solid voice work   or just thought no one would care that much. lily gao is pretty and asian   but none of that matters in this type of work. we can only hear her   and she came up short.
every voice actress prior to lilli really had the femme fatale thing down. they also seemed to want to sound similar to each other. lilli makes her sound uncertain  and the different voice is jarring. lilli is cute though.
she should ask chris pratt about how he handles negative comments.  no one seemed to have an issue ripping on him for his mario va
in instances like this  the blame should lie with whoever was responsible for the casting. some people will not fit with the roles or will need proper guidance to pull it off. and if the actress deserves criticism it should not turn into bullying. that is cruel and also dumb  everyone f cks up at times. criticize and move on.
when people say they like the emotionless tone to her voice  do you think that s a choice the actress made  clearly they haven t seen her other work. look up the love club sydney  which is a romantic comedy and it s the same delivery!
a lot of times it sounded like a person not sure how to go about their words or nervous when ada talked slow. and the others bored which others defended that was realistic. well it aint entertaining to hear someone that has the personality of daria. other than that. no she shouldnt be bullied but i think they would have still called it bullying and trolling even if people went through the proper channels in a constructive way. this is the new age.
when i heard her va preformence in the remake  it sounded like it was phoned in  text to speech robotic like  reminded me of peter dinklege vaing on sleeping pills for destiny.
capcom is the one who chose her in the end so i d say it s their fault. for lily gao  i don t condone any harassment but i honestly didn t see much online even before she deleted her posts on tw. most are just expressing how they re not a fan of ada s new va which is valid  some are pointing out how her voice acting is so dry and dull which is very different from all ada va before. the worst i ve seen are those who are just making fun of her va which is honestly something you d expect if you re well-known or something. what i don t understand is why is she pulling up race and white privilege card like it s the problem here  she did a mediocre job and capcom was ok with it so it s expected that people are gonna say something about it.
i was empathetic towards lily gao but exacerbating the situation by implying that this is due to racism or some bs white privilege doesn t help. should she be bullied  no. is criticism allowed  yes. people mistakenly conflate criticism as hate. basically  her instagram leaving up one post only about these topics says a lot about her character as well.
the re2 remake voice actress was perfect in my opinion  and they should ve kept her for the re4 remake instead. i m not furious or angry like everyone else it s toxic that these fans feel the need to rush her social media account  i understand the upset for sure but put the same energy to capcom instead of the actress  she did alright and gave her best but nothing will beat the og voice from the original version
who on earth told you they dont like your voice  i think it s cute.
agree  better to send the complaints to capcom directly.maybe ask for mod to change her voice  because there s one in youtube who did that  copy the voice from re4 original and dub the remake
also if you take on the job you should do research. look up past voice acting for the role and what kind of persona ada has. not just be flat and boring. plus nobody jumped to defend chris pratt from harsh criticism he got yet he took it like a champ but this one blames it on  privleged white people  and everyone defends her
exactly  even if they were determined to have an asian voice her  i m certain they could have found one to play the role better than that with a small amount of effort.i guess she played ada terribly in that return to raccoon city movie or whatever it s called  so they just hired her based on that.
that s probably the one way they can salvage this.....
you know who else is cute  you
yep. people didn t rush to defend hit at all. yet he took it like a champ and even apologised which wasn t needed. yet the voice actress for ada gets criticised and everyone rushed to her defense even after she made comments about  privledged white men .the bias is showing
interesting... so this is her  best  performance when it comes to romantic scenes huh  i would ve loved to hear jolene andersen as ada s va again.
yeah it made it seem like only white dudes complained when everyone and their grandmothers did!! she should ve just posted something against bullying overall then
surely they should be blaming the directors for this has they should of been guiding her and telling her what she should sound like
i think she was a bad casting choice for ada  but she doesn t deserve to be bullied or harassed over it. her casting and her performance should be criticized for sure  but she shouldn t be attacked as an individual over it.
she sounds ok  but i liked the old version more
they should have use jolene andersen again! she was really good in re 2 remake.
for me  lily gao  should have researched past  va acting and compare it to her va acting.. maybe capcom should also do more review in ada s past va voiceover.. you know some fans will look   for example luke  mark hamill  will always be luke skywalker or henry cavills superman witcher on how they portrays it.. almost all fans will always look for the first person who portrays the character perfectly.... one thing i notice though almost all  ada s 1st va before lily.... nah..  i just leave it be....
idk why they didn t just use her va from the resident evil 2 remake cuz her performance in that game as ada was really good in that game imo. but yeah lily s performance in the re4 remake to me felt a little lifeless and i hope she takes some of the criticism that s actually valid as constructive criticism and tries to add a little more variety in her performance when the separate ways dlc eventually comes out.
shes spitting facts ong
she was delivering the lines with like  a breathy airy way. like she was nervous to be too loud. borderline whispering
her performance was sub pair also  always save receipts
i didn t like her voice at first but during my second play through it kinda grew on me. she s certainly not the best choice for ada wong but i don t think she s that bad.
this is how modern day criticism works though  people take it to the source now and unleash everything that s bothering them. the og voice actress was where it was at as she was the one who brought the life into the character. the va for 6 i disliked  didn t mine the va for re2 remake but still not it. re4 remake had to been like a woke decision  terrible
i don t think the voice actress did a bad job. actually did a great job. the problem  imo  is that the voice doesn t fit the character.
no  lily gao does not deserve the backlash. 1. it s capcom s fault for giving an okay to the terrible voice acting.2. it s the director s fault for letting the acting come out the way it did.3. despite the acting is terrible  no one should ever harass lily gao.
lily gao sounds like she arrived late to class and her teacher asked her to read a chapter out loud. lol
when you compare her to the first two voice actors  lily gao sounds bland.
nu ada is perfect she actually sounds like a person finally.
it s not just her. when re7 was made  capcom in an interview stated that they were going to save money by having mo cap actors do the voices as well. that s why all the characters are downgraded in terms of voice acting in re engine games. and how we went from roger craig smith to that guy that voiced chris in re7. indeed if you check the wiki  all the voice actors in re7  8 remake 2  3 and 4 are the mo cappers. before re7  most characters had different mo cap actors and voice actors.
yeah  i wasn t pleasantly surprised by the voice actress change  mostly because it was different and didn t have a great delivery. maybe  ms. gao wasn t prepared there s no need to harass or bully lily gao for a lacking performance  but criticism is always fair game  criticism is one way we can do better. conversely  if we can t take criticism  we can t improve as people.the first two ladies  voice acting from the original games were excellent. they got the character of ada right. the others weren t too bad  but not great.ada s been one of my favourite characters from original resident evil 2. femme fatale  wears red and capable and ambiguous in terms of motives  ada wong is a fun character.i still stan leon s. kennedy though. especially in resident evil 4 original.
capcom so we re gonna give yhe the fans an amazing remake of a beloved gamealso capcom but we re also gonna ruin the voice of a beloved important character as well can t give the fans too perfect of a remake now right
personally i d feel like lilly did all that bad  sure she could have done better. the  critics  were a little rude for sure but i also heard she got some death threats which is not okay. criticism is okay but when they get death threats that s definitely crossing a line
no way am i buying a separate ways dlc with that voice in it. only reason i can still play re4r is because she s in far fewer scenes than the original and i can just skip those few scenes  but i would have to skip every scene in a separate ways dlc.she just doesn t have the voice for ada  and i don t think anything she does will change that. trying to force more emotion or personality into it would probably just make it sound more unnatural than it already does.
i watched the making of videos about that ..its very interesting....and thats right and its barley noticeable in the game....but i never noticed the downgrade because ...its really on par with most other games anyway in the series and most games in general....
@jack straw  i disagree on both accounts. i don t think that the voice acting we have now comes close to the one we had with re4  5  6  the chronicles games and the revelations games. i think that was the time  voice acting peaked. and i also don t think that it s the same as other games. see for example god of war who also changed the voice of kratos  he is a good as the original was  now compare it with someone like ethan and you will notice a huge difference in quality.
@jack straw . i actually think  the opposite. the downgrade is very noticeable.
why didn t they just get the woman who did it in re2 remake   they got the same leon so wtf
shout out to dan allen gaming for that video!exactly  others are involved in lily gao playing the role. she has to audition  right  so there s casting directors  an agent  producers  on-set voice directors  acting coaches all involved. i don t encourage harassing them  but lily gao was blessed with that role. i didn t like her work either  but it s not worth attacking her for.
i had no idea vicky from the agonist voiced ada in a game
your so very true melonie i agree with you why go to her when it s capcom and like you said it s a job capcom chose her shoot if it was any of these people that are criticizing her they would ve toke the job as well no questions asked
first time ever watching you and you remind me of someone i used to always play re5 with  so when the remake comes out can we play
hi mel i m from australia and i love your accent. you always come across as very genuine and ppl can have their opinions but never let them change you or bring you down just keep being you coz thats why you re having the success you deserve.
i mean  i preferred re2 remake adas va but she wasn t that bad jesus.
i must be taking crazy pills.. ada s new voice in particular sounds more like a real person with layers than the more cardboard two-dimensional saturday morning cartoon variant of the original. or it might be that it s a vocal minority of detractors that gets amplified by content headlines which thrives on negativity to garner engagement.
howard stern  arguably the greatest radio personality of all time  got criticized his entire career. that fueled him to go on to become great. she should hold on to those feelings and channel that into her roles. channel that anger!
i wasn t a fan of her performance but shouldn t most of the blame be put on the audio director  they are suppose to guide and choose what lines sound best. did the director just not care and take the first try of every line  kinda odd
although i don t think the level of hate she got was warranted in any way. there is fair criticism to be had on her  portrayal of such a beloved character in such an unlikeable way. the devs are just as much at fault however for making her this way. all characters are more serious now  except luis   and ada was just a symptom of that design choice.  she didn t do herself any favors however by blaming all the hate and somewhat  fair criticism   on  white privledge   pretty sure the hate encompasses all  spectrums of the ethnic scale  not just the white people lol.
wait a voice actress was used i thought it was ai generated!
i thought that the voice actress came down with a cold the night before recording her lines. lilly sounded like she had a 102 degree fever and capcom forced her to do the session. they should ve gone with the first va from the re 2 remake
i like your voice  there is nothing wrong with it.
not all actress and actors can be good voice actors actresses  just start by this statement i do agree that gao s voice sounded lifeless and boring for ada but i also don t think she deserved any backlash by that. capcom s fault is obvious when they they need cultural representation for voice acting when we actually don t need that  you don t need to hire a chinese person to voice act a chinese character because if you don t  you gonna be judged by people.
i agree she sounds off. she didn t try to sound like the original. i blame the sound team at capcom for allowing this. i m sure she could of done a good job if capcom told her to sound more ada. i have the same problem with wesker and even krauser. wesker doesn t sound like wesker. the dead by daylight voice actor did a good job and we all thought he was going to voice him re4r but noooo.
i have to strongly disagree on the re2 remake ada  she s the best one imo  no voice has ever been so fitting. but i do agree that re4 2005 ada was also a good one.
she sounded like she did like 300 takes and they just couldn t get it right. smh.  she sounds tired in the takes they chose  like she had been reading all day.  they definitely should ve gone a different direction.  it s okay  but she had by far the least energetic performance of the va cast.  the va for krauser did an excellent job  i was impressed by his enthusiasm for the character.
there s nothing wrong with your voice. you have a beautiful voice. those other people who say other wise are just haters. never let them get to you melonie.
imma be real  new ada sounds like a wine mom about to open the second bottle.
look at their head shots.   that ll give you the reason why.
@heazie that s just face model though she doesn t need to be the voice actress.
@low distortion  please try to understand better what i m saying.
@low distortion  they wanted an asian to play the part  and apparently it didn t even matter if they could play the part well. guaranteed with a little effort they could have found an asian without the deepest voice possible  that actually fit the character and could play the part well  but they didn t even try.
i don t think she made an audition. she was chosen because she already was working with capcom. she was already playing ada in the failed movie of welcome to racoon city.
is there screenshots of what was said to her
that s just her voice.
@heazie  that s why they should ve gone with a different voice actress
@bully maguire  i m not saying they shouldn t have kept the same person.  i m just saying that s her voice.   no cold or forced performance.   they wanted to match the race of the character at the expense of quality.
@heazie  they could have found a better asian voice actor for her with a little effort. probably any english speaking  asian voice actress could have delivered a better performance  this voice is way too deep and bland and the worst possible fit for ada.
@jack m  they should never have found a new one to begin with.
tch  this is the faye valentine thing all over again  she can be however a talented writer director voice actress can manage  it just has to be a good jorb  homestar. and yeah  some ada performances are a little.. underperformed  but uhh  yeeeesh  this is the big leagues. sally cahill s portrayal makes the hairs on my neck tingle  good  god  . but yeah  that s why there s a difference between speaking and acting.
also there is a clearly a filter over her voice like audio wasn t mixed right or the mic they had her use was garbage. only time she sounds.... normal  is at the after credits cutscene. it s almost like a different person
so much backlash for what   do you guys even know the native speaker language   i truly agree about lily being ada s va. as an asian  to me she sounds perfect as a silent sassy spy girl. some clowns have only played re4 og and crying that ada is not that childish flirty anymore. i liked the asian voices in ada specially remake re2 remake re4 and the movies version of ada. lily you nailed lines of remake
she sounds great! people just suck
interesting. hey melonie. yellow looks great on you. hopee you have a wonderful day.
i get the complaints when you compare all the voice actors together. i have to say i liked her in the re4 remake.
in that video showing the voices for comparison  you can clearly see that most of the va tried to stay in character  which is a sexy  sultry voice except for the re2 remake  then we went to boring and not interested voice. while the dead for daylight voice was kinda meh  you can hear that she did try to sound  sexy . lily gao tho  didn t even bother like re2 remake s va. which makes me wonder if this is actually the direction that the director wanted and is not lily gao s fault at all.
sounds like lily did the voiceover via facetime.
i wouldn t say it s her fault  i would say it s capcom s fault for being ok with those line delivery s.
ada voice actor must ve did good enough these ppl playing resident evil to be loving it by saying how attractive she sounds well a few youtubers said her voice a lil off but i don t think it s terrible
oh my goodness  that bright yellow! melonie  you own that color!
i m not sure what people are on about  sure  ada sounds different but i for one like this new performance. to me she sounds even more seductive and mysterious than ever before.
the one who deserves harsh comments is capcom because they hired her only cause she is chinese-american just like ada  but honestly - lily gao is cold dying fish and someone is pointing gun to her face forcing her to read text before death. the best ada voices are sarah cahill and courtenay taylor. i do not know why they do not hire one of them. and do not understand why ashley have same va as jill valentine.
she doesn t deserve harassment or anything like that but she was really bad. it distracts from the experience. it s so noticeable. i don t know why they just didn t hire the ada from re2 remake.
i think a lot of people have an issue with the voice. i m not saying this lady is a bad va  it s more about consistency. i think ada s writing material was bad and the voice just didn t fit. this combination made for a less than ideal experience for some  mostly those who were used to ada being all seductive. i don t think it s ok at all to attack the va with insults. there s criticism  then there s being a piece of shit over a video game. blame the writers and the people who thought she fit the role.
personally  i liked her voice. idk what the issue was.
she seemed to be going for a cold and detached performance. she s there to steal for wesker but has a soft spot for leon. i took the performance as a woman who probably cares more than she lets on but has to keep a cold and uncaring tone or else she might get too attached and then switch to the other side. sometimes  playing cold can come off as flat and robotic. that being said  don t go onto people s pages like that and say stuff like that.
lily gao is the first asian voice for ada wong  in english  i believe. she did her best. it s the director that sets the tone and vibe for the character. lily did what she was asked for. she was told to sound cold and detached. she did her job  blame the director.
do people not realize she plays ada in the newest remake movie   i assume that s one of the reasons why capcom hired her to do this but is she even an experienced voice actor    most likely not .  it really all does come down to the production team for having her read it that way and leaving it that way.  criticism is fine but obsessing over it as though it ruined your life  that s just absurd.
the fault lies with the person who cast her in the first place. reminds me of fran of  the nanny.
thank you
i was thinking the same thing she had like a cold and serious tone  and they said that the remake was gonna be more serious  so to me  it made more sense  so i was ok with it.
agreed the blame lies on capcom and the director. even for re2r ada s va performance was bad. so i see a continuation in the cold and detached tone there
btw  is she even a professional voice actress  i think she is both or just a normal playing actress  pretty different thing  someone who plays good not necessarily can voice a character good standing in a small room with a mic  instead of a filming set.
i don t know about ada s voice  i m here for the cat
don t listen to the haters! i love your voice have a wonderful day  melonie. your hair very pretty today btw
i am a huge fan of re4  it s my favorite game of all time. played it on ps2  ps3 360 xbox one  series x and now the remake. ada is my favorite character in the re franchise. i love ada wong! her chapter in re6 was my favorite. granted isn t hard to do in that game lol. in re4 her voice acting was flat no doubt. probably the biggest thing in the remake i didn t care for. but it didn t ruin the game for me. i read and heard she got death threats and much more rude comments then what that post said on twitter. death threats or name calling is what i consider going to far. those comments are not it.  great video as always melonie!! and for an unrelated subject  all you have is a cat in your room among what you re recording on lol but the cat is a nice touch!
i think ppl are confusing bad voice acting with cold and mysterious. in no way does her voice sound like good voice acting. it sounds like she didn t even try literally reading off script. voice acting isn t easy  and not everyone can do it. it s a discredit to the professionals that actually work in that industry. she doesn t deserve the hate at all  but the criticism yes. criticism isn t mean  especially when dealing in an industry based on talent. we ve continuously seen bad casting based purely on a celebrities status or simply looking like a character they are meant to portray  when talent always should come first. she shouldn t have even made it past the audition if there even was one. considering she s the actress that played ada in the live action movie i doubt it.
hearing lily all i picture is her in the booth with a  face reading the lines. at least the other ones the good and bad i can visualize them moving around and making faces when delivering the lines.
not gonna lie  lily sounded like she was reading the lines  i can see why people don t like it
the only thing that legitimalu sed me out is when they removed the kiss line and switched to work. like ffs are we at 1940 s again
hey melonie wazzzup  have a blessed day my beautiful sister
she s woke and she can t handle criticism no one from that generation can. i don t understand why she just doesn t turn notifications off instead of deleting her account
melonie  any thoughts on the show nikita  i only started binge watching it recently  seems like chuck but more serious.
she played her in the last resident evil movie if i remember correctly and that movie wasn t all that great. i can t even remember how she was because i was trying to push it out of my head.
i realoy didn t think that ada s voice character wasnt bad at all. i thought she sounded pretty close to the original. i was much more disappointed in saddler s voice. they made him an american  but this whole thing is supposed to take place in a spanish-speaking country in europe. him and ramon  i hated much more than ada. its sad that people love a fake story so much that they would direct hate towards a real person.
to be honest i agree ada did not give me the hot agent feel playing the game in the remake capcom knew they are going to take the risk they should be responsible for ada voice actress performance as she lacks energy and i can t help but feel she didn t want to be in the game.i mean if the voice actors over the years that play kratos can give us best performance ever why cant she
new video! go boom!
her performance was really flat to me  but it almost feels like that s the direction they gave her.i hate the performance  but people need to chill out and leave her be. it s just the job she was hired to do.
the va is fine in other works i ve heard her in. it was just a simple miscast by capcom. that had catastrophic results...
lily gao tone fits ada but the big problem is the acting  so the only options are she s a bad actress or she had bad direction
honestly  her voice wasn t that bad enough to ruin my experience with the game. personally  it is what it is  and i didn t really care for the seductive tones in her voice with the past two actresses because nowadays  it sounds really corny. maybe she could ve put more effort into the acting to not sound so dry  but it is what it is.
she wasn t good  but people are taking it way too far. i will never understand why people feel the need to take to social media to tear her down. those people need to get a life.
thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  you know me    can t help myself
it definitely ruined the scenes with ada for me  and completely killed my desire to play a separate ways dlc. i really hope a lot of people refuse to buy the dlc like me so capcom gets the message.thankfully they cut out s lot of her scenes from the original re4  so i just have to skip a few cutscenes  but no way am i paying for an ada dlc where i would have to hear that horrendous voice for ada the entire time.they ruined one of the best characters in re  and it almost feels like they knew it and that s why they cut so much of her dialogue from the original.
thank you justin!
if a chef serves a bad meal  people criticise. why are precious actors above criticism  people going in hard but it s a part of life  they love constant praise and validation.
everyone s entitled to their opinion. i didn t have an issue with her voice acting at all. i ve played and finished all of the re games  including re4 remake  and there wasn t a point where i thought this actress sucks or that it ruins the game in any way whatsoever. in my opinion the people who think this are dramatically overreacting - ada is barley in this game . ultimately it means less people will play separate ways  maybe. my guesses are that it won t.
yeah seriously you have a genuine and kind voice  please don t let those negative comments get to you. girls with voices like yours are normally fun people. keep doing you!
i dunno she sounds sleepyi don t know capcom made this why they haven t made her do another take were they in a rush to send the voicesamples to japan on time so that it won t slow re4 remake s release date
tbh i don t think lily s performance was that bad. i think what s tripping people up is that lily is going for a different take on ada. less of a seductive femme fatale  more of a cold and hardened mercenary who prefers to conceal her true emotions. i also think the va s naturally deeper voice makes it a bit harder to emote. if you notice  when she shouts or raises her pitch it sounds like her voice is about to crack. that isn t something the va can really help  that s just her natural range.
her voice sounds off but is not her fault also is weird how they are more bothered about ada voice instead all the amazing parts they off from the original game
never like remakes but i don t think it s necessary to give her hate. but what do you do. a lady is allowed to take any job she likes. she needs to get paid like everyone else. great video today melonie! looking amazing in your favorite color! god bless!
also with the direction of most game dev  publishing company etc  they tend to alway give more to the broad audience than the fan of the serie video game  so i think they was just wanting to not upset twiter  and throw oldest memory of the game in the trash.
i liked gao s ada as much as i ve liked any other ada. she gave me the impression that her ada had been doing the things she does for a while  and it was just another day at the office. kind of like the old sam   ralph looney tunes shorts. if that s not what she was going for  well  there s a problem.
they should ve stuck with courtenay taylor as ada. i cant and refuse to forget how sexy her voice was. while i did think her voice acting skills could ve been done better  she actually tried with this. afterall lily gao s new to the industry and according to imdb she s never voiced video game characters before so sometimes not everyone new to voice acting gets it right the first time. but calling her terrible is just hurtful. dammit these nimrods made her delete her instagram what a bunch of imbesils stupid fools. i hope capcom grows some ball hair and keep her in the resident evil community regardless of her voice acting  she still very much deserves to be apart of it there s no doubt for that.
i personally thought she wasn t trying to sound sexy because her and leon s character seemed more indifferent than romantic.
i have played and almost beaten resident evil 4 remake and i can say yeah her performance sounds phoned in she just has no emotion to her voice    and i don t usually notice voice acting positive or negative it just sounds like she doesn t want to be there you can kind of tell she doesn t care about the role.
i spoke about this her performance was horrible. voice actors have to give life to a character they are voicing. jack krausers voice actor had emotion but not suited for the look of krauser. imagine darth vader voiced by the voice of justin bieber. it s just her acting was bland. at least chris pratt acknowledged that mario has a huge fan base and understood he didn t want to ruin fan s childhood character and this was due to fans saying mario doesn t sound italian now  she has a nice voice but in comparison i felt like she just didn t research ada wong
her lines were written poorly  her acting wasn t good  but it s not completely her fault  unless she was blackmailing capcom  capcom decided to put those readings of the lines into the game  and wrote a very bare and honestly shitty script for her to read.i genuinely think someone at capcom hated the character of ada wong and rushed everything connected to her character. i mean i hated her scenes  but again how many reads did she do  was this the best one  or did capcom demand a one and done in a day recording
i don t think people need to go to her personal account to say those things. but you can say it on a public forum. say it on twitter all you want  but do you have to @ her  do you have to dm her  when you go that far then yeah i would call it more than critisizing her performance  they are going out of their way to make sure she personally know it. i disliked her too  but i would rather express it to capcom directly cause they hired her and approved of those final lines.
i agree  the first 2 va were far better choices.
your takes on the voice actresses are spot on.
the audio was not that good that s not her fault and i don t see the problem the voice fit the character would imagine how she sounds like i just think some fans are overreacting and trying find a reason too hate something
i don t get it. i mean  it s still a woman s voice. she sounds fine. it s not like they pulled a hogwarts legacy and had a guy be her voice actor. there was no social media campaign about that shit. and that was literally offensive to the ears. i didn t hear about anybody messaging that hogwarts legacy va on instagram to say he was jarringly terrible as the voice of that bartender at the 3 broomsticks. the internet is the place where selective outrage flourishes like nothing i ve ever seen before and gets so blown out of proportion that it s not even real anymore. imo  this sounds like a case of people with too much time on their hands and nothing positive to do with that time. and so they jumped on an internet hate train.
maybe it s me being the old school gamer that i am but as long as the vas aren t completely terrible in a bad way instead of a so bad it s good  like the original re 1  i don t really care much about the voice acting. i do agree that if you re going to criticize the best please is not the va s personal socials.
yes
yep people railed on chris pratt for it and he took it like a champ and none of these youtubers ran to his defence. in fact they mocked him just as much.yet when it s this everyone rushes to her defence and ignored the glaring problem of the white privledge comment
not sure she s going for anything  because i ve heard she s given this same bland delivery in everything she s been in.
@jack m  if you re talking about welcome to raccoon city  i don t see why the same idea can t apply to both. in both iterations she can still interpret the same character the same way  and that makes it consistent.
@soapbubble  that movie was pretty much unanimously disliked anyhow  so nobody cares about consistency between that and the game. they care about ada being the same character she has been in the games up to this point. 4 is a sequel to 2  and leon s campaign in 6 a sequel to 4  and ada has always been a similar character  to drastically change her all of a sudden because of a movie nobody liked makes no sense.
@jack m  i m not talking about consistency between the movie and the game as a whole  i m talking about consistency in how she portrays ada as a character. it s a deliberate choice she made as a performer. my point is that she leans moreso into the aspect of ada as a cold mercenary  rather than as a seductive femme fatale.
thank you so much  andrew!
@melonie mac go boom  you most welcome melonie!
this comment makes no sense at all.
@seven  it s plain enough to understand imo... he s saying people weren t harassing the hogwarts legacy va over that atrocious shit where they had a man voice female character model and called it trans... it came off creepy as hell to be honest. the character s name was sirona. i don t think a single person that played hogwarts wasn t at the very least thrown off by how terrible that voice is  regardless of how you feel about the transagenda. yet there was no backlash.but ada wong sounds less seductive and nerds get up in arms about that to the point of harassing a va on social media. he s right. it s a combination off selective outrage and bandwagoning in regards to ada.
well her new voice is the good reason to go play the og separate ways.
i think a lot of people are puffing up the voice actress as if she did a  good job  just because they want to look like they re not affiliated with  the haters .no she should not have gotten the hate over her role but that doesn t retroactively make it a good performance either. i ve seen anime before..i refuse to believe this is the average quality of an asian voice actress   now that is racism.
to be fair an actor s actress  performance  regardless of skill and the script is only as good as their direction. even the absolute best actor s actress  will suffer at the hands of bad direction. lily gao might be a very good actress  but we can t be sure if the quality of this performance is due to lack of skill or if this is what the director wanted her to do.
totally agree. no need to go to the actress  personal media  this wasn t her fault or at least not just hers. capcom heard her pitch for ada and approved it.still this ada is ass  in a bad way. probably the worst part in otherwise excellent game. voice is so nasal sounding and like a 60 yo grumpy grandma. no chemistry with leon  batman-catwoman like situation  no femme fatale vibe
i don t personally think her performance is bad.  but i agree with both things you said that for one none of the comments seemed like  harassment  it just seems like these days people think any critique must be harassment since it makes them feel bad.  and yeah  it s not lily s fault people don t like her performance people should be taking it up with capcom instead.
at first i was like man why the hate and then i heard and i was like omg that s pretty bad. everybody know that ada wong is a dommy mommy its all over the inner zones the memes are there this is a big oof on capcom  but like they nailed it with lady dimitrescu but they completely face-planted on ada wong
og re4  re6  and the re2 remake voice actor for ada were the best ones in my opinion.
actors can do so much. when all is said and done  it s the casting directors who chose her  the voice director who is suppose to guide her  etc. is she bad  not really was she the best fit  not really
i haven t played the game  i m boycotting for a whole different  petty reason   but i did listen to her and i agree  it s bad. like i have respect they wanted to give the role to a non-white actress as they have been doing in the past. that said  i m sure any chinese voice actress could do a better job if they have the right fit  which i m always thought as mysterious and alluring  rather than seductive  it being seductive would fit more in a persona game  with how many grown woman lis there are in that series  love the series  but find the adult lis creepy . i have listened to many spoofs of resident evil games lately and there ada voice actors there have a better voice than this actress did. i hope she gets to shine better  but i think capcom should have tried harder  and it could have been a direction thing as well . my issue i had with this game is the girl dressing like ashley  because i do not believe that is ashley. no shame to the face model  i think she got done dirty by how she looks so sick in each promotional item of her. but my biggest issue is the fact not only does ashley have a certain look  but her hair  which looks like a party city wig   and her eyes just cause confusion. i mean they had a show back in 2021 on netflix and she looked the same  with natural looking hair and brown eyes and now she looks like sherry berkin cosplaying as her. it s petty  but i don t think her redesign looks good at all.
people are seriously overreacting. i can understand people like the voice less  but it s not deserving of the very harsh comments that they give. i feel people who post these rude comments are just 13 year old teenagers. people have to learn how to give constructive critisicm in a nice way. and as you said  better to mail capcom about it instead of the actress. they have way more power to improve the voice accting for next time when ada appears on screen. either by guiding lily gao in how to deliver the lines  or recasting the actress again.by the way  introduce your cat to us. he is all alone there in a corner.
whether or not you liked her vo  people never cease to amaze me with how utterly pathetic they can be.
i loved the voice acting in this game except for ada s  i dunno why but she sounds lazy and even bored jaded. capcom is to be blamed here  though  not the actress  they are the ones that saw that poor job and decided it was good to go with.edit  also  people really need to learn how to provide feedback criticism without personally attacking the person  it stops being objecting the moment it is taken personal.
the first two voice actresses blow the others away. capcom should have seen if the ogs wanted one more run with ada
i genuinely thought capcom hired kyle dunnigan to do his caitlyn jenner impression when i first heard ada in the game.
your voice is fine  idk why people hate on your voice.
i like the empty room.  it has a clean feel.  also  kitteh in the corner!
as someone who has been watching re4r playthroughs  i don t think she sounds that bad
saly cahill omg the best ada wong version to me miss your voice so much
the voice actor is being called  ada wrong  because she doesn t sound anything like ada s character and it s fine to critique a public performance as long as it s done respectfully.
remake  was the best ada wong  in 2019oh  the japanese dub. i did the japanese dub for remake  and it was perfect. very fem fatale. near every game that offers japanese dubs anymore i take it. the english dubs  they sound like millennials and gen z that just discovered the f word. the japanese dub to breath of the wild  bloodstained ritual of the night  resident evil 2 remake remake   remake  etc. they actually voice act in japan
truth
death threats are not harassment
@mrmooguy91  there was not a single death threat in the comments pointed out.
sally cahill is 63 and courtenay taylor is 54  so probably not considered.
it sounds pretty emotionless and lazy in my personal opinion. if she was meant to sound like a cold hearted assassin  then maybe but that s not how she s been portrayed since she was added into the game.
it s because capcom knew it would be a hit no matter what. they could ve hired vas off of fiverr and it would still sell well.
yes  she did. she also decided to go full woke blaming  white supremacy  or some crap.
oh stop. there s no evidence she received any extraordinary harassment. she received criticism for her terrible performance  and the media and the usual suspects engaged in the same tactics they always use to defend someone in a protected class.
capcom fumbled with this one for real
jolene has the best voice imo has most range despite not sounding femme fatal
i know she wasn t good in this but she didn t deserve all that hate and backlash towards her
casting and voice direction are also to blame. she didn t fit the role. she probably didn t get the directing she d need anyway.
another diversity hire.
i ve always liked courtenay s ada slightly better than re2 and darkside chronicles actresses  it s more mature  re2 remake s ada was really good for a re-imagined timeline. re4 remake s ada was alright  but she s forgettable  it comes off as lazy and sounds recorded in a closet  it s a mix of laziness and technicality as it doesn t sound properly mixed and mastered.
i feel like lily s take is more sinister. colder. less sympathetic. it s a lot more serious  too. it s still sarcastic  but it s not as playful as the good previous ada voices.
i also didn t like ada s new voice  but how is it the va s fault  this world is rotten because of bullies and idiotic critics like those people. shame on them. i hope the new va is okay   doing fine. i like the voice  it just didn t fit ada. maybe i m just into the old versions. best of luck in the future new va.
it s kind of sad. i like resident evil four i haven t bought the remake yet. there were a few things in the original story that could use a little tweaking nothing is perfect. i hope that the bad casting of ada  was just the way to appease woko haram. because of they make ashley graham a strong independent woman that don t need no man. the real bad ass who is always saving leon  let s just say that i will not be buying it at a high price. or any price for that matter. those concerns are the main reason i not bought the game yet. the reason i m waiting for some of the reviews because it is the current year after all. they wouldn t want a bunch of misogyny and toxic masculinity. a man being a man protecting a woman. i would be interested in seeing how some of the current year feminists react. if they were on a sinking boat. and they weren t enough life boats for everyone. i bet they would embrace traditional gender roles pretty quick.
she didn t  deserve  anything  it was simply a shorty casting decision by capcom.
i ve never played any re game so i don t care but i ve heard that many fans were shocked and taken out of the experience when hearing ada s new voice.    i just thin it s ridiculous to harass the va when you should be complaining to the person in charge of casting her.   the woman was hired to do a role and she did it  it s not her fault she was cast poorly.i do find it funny that the asian voice actress was the worst person for the job of voicing an english speaking asian character when compared to previous vas. just from the samples you played i think sally cahill sounded the best.
i haven t heard that dead by daylight voice acting but it sounds like it could have come from the ps1 era  d like tenchu stealth assassins  with the flat voice  d
her voice is good i am fine with that
sally was the best for ada. still i would not bash someone work or be this rude to them over something that capcom wanted for the franchise  people these days. also i understand people frustration with this  it caught me off guard as well.
her va work was bad  but she doesn t deserve bullying. that said i would like some actual receipts on the  harassment
lily gao s performance in re4 remake is just mediocre. she s not so bad but definitely needs to polish her va such as knowing about the character and putting some passion in her work. ada s voice should be mysterious  smooth and a bit alluring tone  not stiff and emotionless. a lot of actresses portrayed as ada before her and they re all good at it. on the other hand  re fanbase had high expectations for this remake and capcom should ve hired more experienced actress for ada. it s not fair to harass lily gao for voicing ada coz this is all capcom s fault after all. they just made a poor decision.
why are you telling me to stop when my video basically said this same thing  lol!
@melonie mac go boom  he didn t watch before replying
@melonie mac go boom  i read it as if it was a statement to the people saying that in the media not you but maybe i was giving too much benefit of the doubt.
also odd how the only asian has the worst voice for the asian character.
if someone is bad at their job then they bear at least some responsibility for that. there are very few occasions when an actor or actress is well into their career and they bear no responsibility at all for a terrible performance.should the lions share of criticism be directed at capcom  yes. though there is blame for lily gao as well  unless she wants to tell us how and why it s not her fault at all.given as she chose instead to blame  white supremacy  i m not inclined to give the benefit of the doubt. yes  she bears at least some responsibility for a poor performance.either in not doing her homework on the character and previous ada va performances  not polishing her va talent  having this sort of response to any criticism explains that   or not taking direction well. is it possible the direction was poor  it is.though her acting elsewhere has also frequently been wooden and she chose to blame  white supremacy  rather than give us a concrete reason for falling short. so yes  at a minimum lily gao does bear some responsibility.seeing people trying to drown out any criticism with toxic positivity is immensely tiresome. it solves nothing  and is part of the reasons the entertainment industries are in the state they are.
still sounded slightly better than re4r imo  that s how horrendous her voice is in this game.
okay  look  two things i took from film theory  good directors  producers too  but usually directors  can get a great performance from a bad actor  not so much the other way around. lilly s delivery is very dry  worst thing i could say about it is that ada sounds like she s bored. it is not lilly s fault these were the takes that made it into the game  at least a dozen people on the development side had to approve and mix and adr the voice lines from raw and put them into the game. either lilly gao royally screwed up in the booth or a few people in charge had an ax to grind. and i mean on either side of the pacific. if it wasn t capcom usa s localization team  it was the capcom japan team.
the problem is that any criticism is seen as harassment these days.
almost felt bad before i read the only image left on her instagram.
it s criticism sure but why not bring this criticism to the director of the game and not the actress who was performing for the company and director that hired her  guided and accepted the performance
i wouldn t call those comments which were ss as harassment as every single voice actor who did an underperforming job gets them no matter what
her performance was pretty bland. it didn t help that all the other voice performances in the game were great. it really made her lifeless performance that much more noticeable. wish they used the va from re2r. she was great.
personally i saw nothing wrong with her voice acting  but than again when i play a game  my first second third and on and on concerns go towards the gameplay. if i can i always skip the cutscenes.
i liked her take on ada. i prefer re2  but the hate is not warented.
mel   my voice ain t sexy me  o.o !...
criticism yes  bullying no. i think the guy who retweeted all these tweets you showed overexaggerated. are they mean to some extent  yes. is it bullying  no. they just voiced their criticism. i expected much worse tbh. capcom and their casting director team botched this one big time. the real question is why they made this decision. was it because of the innocuous reason that lily played ada in the netflix movie  re welcome to racoon city  and they thought she was kinda solid to replace jolene with because jolene joined a union  or is it more sinister i.e. jolene fell prey to capcom s diversity policy.
regardless of how good or bad it sounds  the real question is why capcom keeps changing the voice in the first place.
i was waiting on you to male this video  i had a feeling we would think the same about it
okay i ve watched multiple clips of the voice actresses and their comparisons. i actually don t hate lily s performance. i ve been playing resident evil for quite a long time and really enjoyed all of ada s vas performances. the criticism is justified if you thought her delivery of certain lines gives off cold  dead and dry but... isn t that ada s thing tho  cold and dead expressions mixed with her only looking out for herself. she s still a femme fatale but some of y all are really clouded by nostalgia.
keep up the good work
i had no idea vicky psarakis was doing voice acting. she s front woman of the agonist  metalcore melodeath band. i have to say she sings much better than she voice acts...
i m wondering... is the dialog so different between games that someone couldn t mod the old voice back in
you re right about good directors. mel gibson s apocalypto comes to mind apparently  several of the cast weren t even actors. i definitely think this case had more to do with bad directing than anything  and possibly miscasting  but more so the former.
i hope capcom do something  they need to re record her voice for better quality because her voice sounds like she recording in bathroom  or they recasting her with someone else and i hope it s jolene andersen
criticism isn t bullying  ill agree on that but how people take criticism today is that they just think it is bullying  i have a friend who didn t like lily s performance but he never sent her hate like that and wasn t over the top  i myself was ok with her acting  i defended her performance alone on my instagram page too and the post i made defending her has nothing to do with her ethnicity or white privilege as i m only defending her performance from bully s who go too far  its ok if you didn t like her acting in the game and never send her hate coz its your opinion. this is yet another example of why i m slowly losing faith in humanity and its from both sides of this issue. and using white privilege is a lazy and arrogant way of defending yourself in an argument coz then you will essentially portray yourself as the kkk equivalent to your ethnic group.
i don t see why she deserves criticism  letalone bullying . someone higher up than her decided that the performance and how it sounded was good enough  when it clearly wasn t . all she could do was voice act like how she was told.it s like complaining to chris pratt about his voice in the mario movie  he didn t decide to use that voice. he was told to use the voice in the movie by a director...
i honestly think her voice is great. it s very mysterious but hot at the same time.
they re already working on it  i m sure it won t be long before there is a completed mod. sadly i just have a ps5 so skipping the scenes with ada is my only solution. thankfully many of her scenes from the original have been cut  which would normally annoy me but now that they ruined the character i think they did us a favor. i m really hoping all of the backlash forces a change of voice actors for an ada dlc  but i doubt it. all i know is i am not buying an ada dlc with that voice  it would ruin the entire experience for me.
i hate when people direct their ire to the wrong people. she may suck as a voice actress  but the blame should go to the woke casting director who insisted  only an asian woman can voice an asian character.  it s not gao s fault she was unqualified for the job and still hired for it.
sad that lily is receiving all this hate   she just doesn t sound like ada   the criticism should be directed at capcom for the inconsistency  wish capcom just stick with the 2make s actress.
i like this girl. she shares my opinions about all the ada voice actresses and view of the situation...minus the the bullying part  i feel just a slight bit of bullying from the extras words after criticisms. like get your point across  cool for sure  but you don t need to say hurtful shit lol
yea people took the voice acting a bit too personal and at they point they just like to complain
critics are our friends  they show us our faults read  being a critic is incompatible with being a bully  or harassing people. if you re bullying harassing - it isn t because you re critical of the product... it s because of something else  and  both you and whoever you re after deserve for you to discover exactly what that something is  sooner than later.
if only they could have gotten megan hollingshead back for this. the og mai from yu-gi-oh! was perfect.
if anything  deleting your social media is a net positive  no matter who you are.
i disagree  i actually don t mind her voice  i also like the va from  re 4 2005. it s a remake  we have a different perspective  the va for the current re4 isn t bad at all for me  but to each their own.
lily gao s voice for her sounds as if ada became a smoker and barely puts anymore effort into her everyday life.
stunning and brave
i could live with your voice.
do we have any sound bites   also she s the new lara croft voice
i never even realised that it was a different woman over the years. i just thought ada s voice always sounded the same. i ve not played dead by daylight so hadn t heard that one. but i thought all of the rest were the same. the new version sounds fine to me
my problem is more the performance. she s sounds like it was either her first take or her last.
people are like children these days  they complain about everything and feel entitled to criticize everything that just doesn t align with them  if someone publicly criticized their work they would say it s bullying and now they suffer from depression because of that criticism  it s stupid
i don t think any of it was bullying. i think it was fair criticism
the lily voice sounds kiddie knot sultry  true. she looks the part
i m sure she is talented but her voice just didn t fit the character  but she doesn t deserve all the hate she s getting. some of these gamers need to chill out and give the girl a break.
yeah  gao s voice is just objectively bad for ada. it s not her fault  she was miscast. that s it. the criticism should be directed at capcom. bullying  the comments are not nice  harsh and mean  but they are criticism on her work. now  i personally do not feel the need to directly criticize voice actors  i am sure she did her best. so what we are talking about a dozen mean comments all of them critiquing her work   the media is trying to capitalize on this as  racism and discrimination  narrative yet again. capcom wants to change actors okay fine  but can we at least expect a little bit of continuity from these remakes  surely they could have found an actress who sounds at least similar to the previous one no  for example troy baker did a great job as a joker in the arkham origins. as it is gao just sounds bored. this maybe due to bad directing who knows  but she was definitely miscast for ada here.
if you want to heal yourself from horrible va acting   go and check out the scene from the upcoming final fantasy 16 with cid and benedikta besides that   criticism is okay . not bullying . point blank   this is capcoms and gao s fault for the failure of ada . gao should have studied ada and capcom are the company who confirms it
criticism is neither bullying nor harassment. it is disingenuous to conflate the two.very few have been bullying or harassing lily gao  though her blaming  white supremacy  for criticism sours many good people on her as an actress and draws not so good people to throw verbal mud at her  like moths to a flame.you should not attempt to write off all criticism as harassment. that is the mistake that lily gao and so many others have made.it s a tactic that only works for minorities and it works less and less of late.chris pratt received criticism far worse than anything i ve seen directed at lily gao  yet he took it on the chin. with good nature and humility.was that the  white supremacy  that lily gao was referring to  is a good natured and humble response to criticism  white supremacy  i very much hope not.
i honestly thought the actress who voiced her in the re2 remake was much better and should have carried her over to the re4 remake.
man they shouldve kept the same voice actress from re4 remake  as soon as i got the where both leon and ada meet each other and hearing ada
people will take anything too far. im not a fan of the va in this role and the blame lies with the director of the game. if someone offers me  10000 to be a va for kratos i d take that job in an instant but we all know judge is the best va for that role.
my favorite ada va is megan hollingshead
i don t care about how she delivered her lines  but i definitely think that her voice can t compare to the original voice actor. the original voice had a seductive sounding voice made it hard to discern whether you could trust her or not. this one sounds like a lesbian
the people defending her voice acting and calling anyone who disagrees an  incel  has forced me to not care about this whole thing....that and the one post she left up on her ig.
if those comments are the samples of going too far  i d say they didn t go far enough. voice acting has been terrible for many years and the studios aren t fixing it so  bully  the lazy uninspired wastes into submission so we can get good products again.  nojusticenopeace - it makes as much sense here as it does when they use it.
it sounds like she s bored half the time and awkwardly talking to someone she s never met before the rest of the time.
yes she did
tbh anyone that blames a race of people  for their bad performance deserves a huge amount of trolling.
from all those voices  the worst are  vicky   lily. the others are fine. megan s voice is perfect i d say.
i personally found ada s voice performance stiff   devoid of emotion too  but here is the thing...we can t determine if that is the fault of the voice actor or whether its the fault of the director  its possible that this was the way the director wanted the voice actor to sound. and to give the actress so much hate   vitriol is extremely childish. its fine to express your dissatisfaction on various game-board sites  but to sent messages to the actor s personal page is disgusting. and again  this could be the fault of the director giving her directions. he could have been telling her   no  that s too emotional  we want you to be cold   calculated.  again  we don t know. directors have a lot of sway and often tell the actors what they want. if the director wasn t happy with the performance then the director would have let the actress know it and would have re-done it. the fact that it was left in means that the director wanted it. anyone who gave the actress crap should be ashamed.
the new voice sound !ess sultry but fit more with the game story. after using emotions to cheat leon to do dirty work for her in resident evil 2 she will  need to have quite a thick hide if she still continue to sound flirty with him. there is a past and guilt when they reunite in re4 and it s best they both keep a distant and sound cold to each other even though the underlying attraction toward each other still exists.
tbh they prob set her up. i wouldn t be surprised if they were using her as a publicity stunt. the difference in quality of her voicelines compared to every other character is clear as day and now the news is spreading like wildfire. everyone is reacting like the va just killed their dog. but its capcom s fault for putting it in the final product.
she was indeed not good. sounded like someone forced her to do the job. i would blame the director on this. or whoever gave her those lines and didn t bother to actually guide her on how she should read the script. but some of these people were real harsh. and some went too far. but then again  in the past 25 years  i ve noticed how nostalgic gamers can be among the dumbest.people actually gave the remake hate for her voice  even though she isn t even the playable character in any section of the game  yet .and some people went as far as complain on how leon is  too serious . but back 17 years ago many of these same people complained how he was too silly or goofy with his cheesy one liners and how unrealistically relaxed he was throughout the whole ordeal.as for your voice  it isn t a problem. it s the occasional way you just use it. you have this way of speaking which is hard to describe in writing.but when you use a more relaxed tone i guess  you sound fine. and you sound and look like you re in your early 20 s still. so feel good about that.
i didn t like the new voice at first  but now it s grown on me quite a bit. i think the deviation is just jarring.i mean  no one has to agree with me on that. still  back when i didn t like the voice  i never even thought of bullying that poor woman. or the directors for that matter. there s a lot of pressure to match the race of the character with the voice actor!
did people hate on the ada voice actor in re2 remake  i wonder why they keep casting her.
sally really was the best ada wong va!!!
constructive criticism isn t bullying. an entertainers job is to entertain  if they can t achieve that then they shouldn t be paid. her voice definitely isn t seductive at all for a femme fatale character. she failed at her job. the casting director is most at fault for incompetence for hiring her. and most likely she was hired bc an asian has to voice an asian character  not bc she was the best for the job.
honestly i didn t care for her voice in re2r  but it seems extremely good after this. i wish they had just brought her back  then i at least wouldn t have to skip every scene she s in and not buy the separate ways dlc. i m really hoping a lot of people don t buy the dlc like me so capcom gets the message  but i doubt it. i ve already seen quite a few people say they ll just skip all of the cutscenes in a separate ways dlc. personally i don t think it s worth buying if i have to skip all of the cutscenes because the main character s voice is completely unbearable.
it really was noticible how bad the voice acting was in the game. ruined the scenes with ada. its rare i feel that way about voice-acting too  so i see why people are mad about it.capcom should re-record it and patch the game  but you know they ll double-down and not do that.
yep. i hate how people are rushing to her defence when she clearly attacked people based on race even tho many were criticising her and yet when chris pratt voiced mario everyone ridiculed him to shit and nobody defended him yet he took it on the chin and thanked the fans for the feedback.like wtf  starting to think a certain bias is at play here
i think courtenay taylor was a perfect ada wong. she sounded a little more mature while still sounding like ada. re4r is the only voice that completely ruined the character for me.
did you see the comments that was said to her
@ville   i didn t comment on the harassment she received. i am blaming capcom for greenlighting her voicelines.
i think the va was very bad  and her copy paste white people bad is boring and predictable. however the ones that should get the blunt force of it is capcom since they are the ones that direct the va in how to do it and they also changed a line  work and tell  instead of kiss and tell  so they 100  wanted to get away from the origins. she would be beyond stupid not to do her best with a project that could secure her a ton of great opportunities. she might not be that talented or the direction in the studio weren t either way capcom should have had an early indication of if they wanted her or not with auditions and then while doing the work.
thats the same thing that happened with resident evil 2 remake when everybody was complaining about claires face
when it comes to voice acting  you have to overact in your voice to make up for the fact that they can t see your face. i get that ada s supposed to be mysterious and that you re supposed to be wondering what she s thinking  but this performance sounds like the va is phoning it in- like she doesn t really care about staying true to the character. not having intention in your lines can break the audience s immersion. ada s a manipulator  so she toys around with leon- playing innocent  and being misleading. so of course your performance is going to sound awful if you don t know why the character is saying what they re saying. tl dr  i blame both the va and the casting director. the cd for not giving guidance on the deliveries  and the va for not thinking about what she s saying.
nah her voice is fine  some weebs just getting upset that a video game character doesn t sound how they wanted to are the same people who are mad at chris pratt for mario  like get a life yo. it s not like the world s ended.
i thought she was fine  i noticed it was different  it sounded thicker maybe  i got used to it pretty quick and it certainly didn t ruin anything for me.
okay  holy crap mel...you are astonishingly beautiful.  compared to the trailer i had to watch before the video started  dang ads  it was a stark contrast.
come on she didnt  even have that much screen time
if they could get the original voice actress to voice all the lines and let you swap them out too replace the new one i would legit pay 20 bucks just to change the voice i m not even lying it s horrible  it s horrendous  its cursed  its an abomination id literally pay 20 bucks for the ability to just switch out the voice to one of the originals. her voice ruins all the parts of the game where ada makes an appearance.
i think you got a great voice
i really don t care about the voices i just want to play and enjoy and my opinion this version of ada not the va  looks like more cold
to be fair i thought most of the voice acting in re4 remake was ass except for two characters... krauser and luis   and even krausers original voice actor i still like better  . krauser and luis are the best characters in the game tbh. i did not like leon s voice actor   paul mercier will always be leon kennedy    ada felt like a non factor  like really the voice acting was not a strong aspect of this game.edit  mike s voice actor was pretty cool  though not as iconic as the original. krauser  luis  and mike had the best voice acting... thats a problem lol
her voice acting just wasn t really good and on top of that i just felt like it just wasn t a good portrayal for her to play as it just didn t feel good when i heard her talk for the first time and now in separate ways i just hope they changed the voice actress or really really make her do the lines over and over again until they sound good. otherwise they re just not going to be good
do you ever try playing resident evil 4 remake live stream  i would definitely buy popcorn  steak fries and watch you having a blast. oh by the way  are you moving out  your room is kinda like ....empty
tell gao to get my digits and she has my support
i was waiting almost 7 minutes for you to say it   sultry  yes. the new ada wong sounds like helga from hey arnold or the slightly older girl kid in rugrats with the cindy doll. sultry  smokey  seductive... and you never saw it coming. femme fatal
1 39 it s not fair criticism though when you say you wasted money for buying the game just because 1 performance you didn t like   that s not even criticism  that s even singling out one aspect while ignoring the other and majority of the good parts
ya its just so flat  not much character  almost thought it was a ai voice  she deserve some of this blame too though because lets be honest its like she just read her lines on a paper and not trying to act with the line reading. but i also agree its a lot to do with capcom.. they couldn t get someone to try and direct her at least or have her hear how the one before in the original 4 went at it  just sounds like lazy work there  which is sad because besides leon  ada is a very loved character.
i guess i m on the other side of this. critiquing her performance is just critiquing the direction she was given which makes sending it to her pointless. it doesn t make her a better va  she s not post avengers robert downey jr. here. she doesn t have the ability to dictate which take gets approved for launch with a project she s working on. she went in and did the job the director wanted of her. clearly they didn t want  more seductive  or that s how they  as the people who direct the vas  would have directed her performance.
ada voice mod packs on the way
re fan base is truly toxic... i hate saying that bc it souds woke. but really its pathetic.
ngl  i though re4r ada s voice was ai generated because they couldn t get her re2r va
gramma voice  so  you ve been caught up in this too.
hey football head  catch! -throws leon the final boss rocket launcher
kudos to you for looking at this objectively i totally agree with you here great video!
passionate criticism should be expected  in stead its called bullying lol.  she deserves it if she went in to this thing thinking she d be immune from it  only a fool would jump on board a project as huge as re4r and just phone in their performance as this person did.  completely killed the character of ada but then again  so did all the character redesigns that removed any sort of sexually suggestive interactions.  what a joke of a remake anyway lol  its for the masses not for the fans.
the same problem as always  not knowing how to manage fandom criticism  with this i don t deny that there are sick people with a lot of free time on the internet  but such serious accusations should be presented with evidence...
is it that bad yes does she need hate no. we also gotta think capcom listened to her performance they directed her on how to deliver her lines they approved her performance so it s ultimately their fault
lily gao s voice ain t bad. i think yours would be great.
i used to be a mail man  getting blasted for things that had nothing to do with me was every week - idiots would come to me to complain about things that were their fault  all full of righteous indignation  that s face to face  mind you  not some words on a screen . and that s nothing compared to someone who works in tech support or customer service  i mean those boys and girls  job description is take attitude and abuse all day with a smile on their face  then come back for more over and over. do they go on their instagram and accuse their idiot customers of ray cism  maybe they do  i just don t know about it because forbes and yahoo won t cover it. lily gao did a bad job  then pouted and cried foul when called out on it. cry me a river.
i think a lot of the criticisms are fair but going in her insta account and posting them specifically to attack her  especially if the post has nothing to do with re4 remake is a bit much
i guess i m alone in thinking lily gao did great   the femme fatale thing was fine for the original games  when they were more cheesy and campy.but with the new serious direction  it makes sense for ada to sound more cold and professional.
capcom or whoever approved her voice acting is the one that should receive the backlash. for god sakes she s a voice actor this is how she pays her bills do you think she cares about the final product  maybe a little but im willing to bet she doesn t care nearly as much about the final product as she does about eating and keeping a roof over her head
is it a qualitative issue  or a quantitative issue. after hearing so much negative reviews   it can bog down on a person. not everyone has a the same threshold towards negative reviews.
this is the first i m hearing of this.criticism is one thing. acting in all forms is subjectively good or bad. i can tell you that i and many others enjoyed the remake and no thought of bad voice acting entered our minds.every part in something is relevant. here  if you change even one person working on or making decisions on who is what character it affects everything. no  have a different casting director and even their sex gender is relevant. no men and women don t think alike. in fact  imo and experience there should be a male and female co-directors for all characters. then it would ultimately be up to the director to weigh in on everything good and bad and make the best possible choice.as for our experience of it all and our opinions those are subjective as well. did it kill the game  no.
the same people literally bullying this lady are the same dudes fucking crying that you can t look up ashley s skirt or how luis doesn t make a comment about ashley s boobs anymore  dudes are mad she doesn t sound all hot and horny 24 7 the voice actress did a fine job i really don t get it  and i ll be the one to say it ada isnt that important shes just hot and popular!!! her performance doesn t make or break the game
agree with you.. but putting the comparisons side by side  i feel that lily gao was just trying to imitate re2make   dbd versions.the ada-ness quality in the va s decline as the series go on lol  but courtney s ver to me is acceptable because there is life in her voice  and she still has that mature  sultry and confident tone in the voice. with re2make ada  i m not so iffed about it bc i put it down to  ada is younger  not as confident   for lack of words.   edit  she has like a wall up  cold exterior  yes  i prefer sally cahill s re2 ada regardless but ok w e  young ada can sound standoffish before dropping her guard bc of leon.to her credit  dbd version isn t that bad  or at least a step above lily s imo   she has a clearer voice at least..  lily s just has a strange way of delivering lines  the intonation and almost casual delivery just sounds jarring at times. some examples..when she says   see ya later   in the boat and   you coming    like she s saying bye to a friend at a cafe or something lol. it s so flat  dead  unemotional...like she forgot this is the man that saved her life and she has a soft spot for. she s far from ada s voice  but if she at least tried to sound a little more sultry  it would be an improvement anyway. sally cahill set the standard for ada s character with her voice  so her versions should have been referenced rather than the newer versions. i don t blame the va so much as capcom for not even coaching her or just thinking this was fine..
no one who is normal is saying her voice or acting is bad we just think it s not a good fit for ada. old actor was perfect. no idea why she was booted for this one.
capcom should have sally re-record the lines lmfao jk
i am not even bothered by her performance. i think it was okay and somewhat memorable. sure  not great as other re games and the remakes.
she removed all her posts on instagram except for one
people would ve been more forgiving about the voice acting if they gave ada a better part. she was kind of a let down.
i don t know anything about this voice actress so i have nothing personal against her  but with that being said i think the criticism is warranted bcuz  her voice in this remake really did sound like she had phlegm at the back of her throat ..so yea not seductive at all lol  her voice for me was a pet peeve bcuz i just wanted the girl to clear her throat the whole time.
she sounded like a female version of jay anthony franke  the guy who voiced jc denton in deus ex utterly deadpan and devoid of emotionbut not in a humorous way like jc denton s voice lines were
although i love the og voice  i still would like the re2 remake. time to move on but keep what works.
she was ok. i think if she had a better voice director.... perhaps it ll change things.
jolene anderson is my personal favorite.
wow... i think people are being a little rough to her directly - but wow... it s bad.
i thought the voice acting was okay   it was decent   could it have been better sure   it least it wasn t bad
ada literally only has like 15 minutes of screen time in a 10-15 hour game  why do you care about her voice so much
if the game was done by kojima it would have been different coz kojima will think 1000 times for voice actors for each characters look at all metal gear series and death stranding it was all perfect!!
she sounds like my grandmother. fyi  my grandmother died last year.
i call this asian hate. she is the only asian voice actress for a supposedly asian role. the mood she delivered was just right since the atmosphere for this remake is more serious than the previous.
who criticize you   but you ve always had the best takes. 4 17
first hogwarts legacy female player characters  now ada s voice.it s almost like modern game developers want female characters to remind us of old ladies...
i didn t care for her performance overall  but i d never go as far as harass i did not care for her performance overall  but i d never go as far as harass this woman.they should be upset w  capcom.
i don t think she s a bad voice actress  but this wasn t the role for her.
if they stuck with a white voice actor  you d get some people saying it s racist and why can t a woman of the same ethnicity voice wong.  capcom went with an actor similar in ethnicity but delivered the lines flat and there s backlash.  you can t please people.  vas should be hired based on their talents regardless of their ethnicity  see kratos
the voice of ada would make a better lara croft lmao
i didn t notice anything. the re4 remake was perfect to me.
she didn t even try to not sound pissed or bored. her portrayal lacks any kind of soul  this is ada s worst iteration so far. design wise she is  awesome  but the voice acting.... it is that bad.
li bingbing was the perfect ada wong in my opinion. she was perfect the perfect femme fatale
honestly  i watched the preview material. the voice acting is terrible for all the characters. the dialogue is even worse. i hated it. every second of it. literally the only reason i bought it was because i wanted to see what the game play changes were going to be.i loved the   cheese  of re4. i still laugh at the ramon and leon exchange over his hand. in fact i ve been reworking my living space so i can hook up my wii again and play my copy of re4  wii.
they chose her for ada wong voice because she casted as ada wong in welcome to the racoon city. bad voice acting  but it s ultimately capcom s decision.
except for snake in mgs5  that was awful. all because he wanted a hollywood celebrity to voice him  he didn t even care who. he tried to get one actor who declined the part and then moved onto whatshisname from 24 and he took it.
@jack m   come on kiefer sutherland was perfect for venom snake coz  he was not the original big boss have you seen this scene my god voice acting is next level  https   www.youtube.com watch v q_wckdf8p50  og  mgs fans loved this voice
i hope you know that she only acted in the movie  and that the voice you are listening to is not even hers  right sally cahill  original ada  had to dubb li binbing in the retribution movie because her english wasn t fluent enough.
@seven  i know. i saw interviews with li bingbing  and she does sound less attractive than the dubbed voice  but still  even her natural voice combined with the way she looked  it would be the perfect femme fatale in my opinion
good god  get the fuck over it  people. resident evil 4 was my favorite game of all time  starting with the ps2  i ve played it endless times on many consoles since then  the most recent one being vr. i had no issues with her voice and it didn t even register as an issue. they wanted a much more serious telling of the story  nobody wanted the exact same game again. i was absolutely psyched for this remake and as many times as it was  remasteted   there was no problem pulling back on ada s  seductiveness.  as far as the remake  i absolutely fucking loved it. it was a masterpiece.
the answers obviously no. i suspect it s a problem of direction if anything but i can see what they were going for.
she was terrible but i don t really care that much since i don t have to hear it constantly  like you do the main character leon   the game is still the best average-reviewed   game of the year  until zelda very likely beats it  because of the gameplay. i feel like the drama is way overblown  ruined the remake  is just silly. but yeah it would be nice if they rehire the past actresses instead for a future story.
so this is why redfield lineage is back on the table...
i think the fan base was just used to the old voice.
these people are crazy. no way ada is worse than salazar va. if anything destroyed this game  which there isn t anything that has destroyed this game  the game is amazing regardless of its flaws  it s the voice of salazar. i don t even like saddler but whatever.
she gets hired based on her race and not her talent and then she complains that people don t think she s talented enough.
i love lily gao s voice acting for the new ada wong!  the backlash has no merit as far as i m concerned.   it think she s perfect!  i swear  we can t have anything good.
the current ada from re4r  is to me  just meh  not totally boring or downright awful  just  meh. granted  she has serious competition from the o.g. version of ada from resident evil 4.
people can criticise but to out rightly attack and bully someone isn t on   shouldn t be acceptable or normalised.
i haven t played any of the games but she sounds like a normy.  but in acting i like to see behavior that makes one character very different from another.  i ve watched scenes of how these recordings are done.  actors don t act freely.  they are directed.
lily sounded great! she had a sexy voice.
not gonna lie. when i 1st heard ada i thought she sounded real masculine. most of the women i know that sound like her are also masculine. i don t really care i love the game this is just my opinion and isn t a big deal.
it s a real shame  because this game has otherwise fantastic voice actors  so she stands out even more. i don t blame her for taking the role  but she sounds so dry and emotionless. this is honestly my goty  but her voice acting is one of the few things i find worse than the original. the original re4 voice actress is still the best.
when you order ara ara and then get pee-wee herman...
sadly sally nailed ada. it s night and day with lily . capcom did terrible casting decision .
i didn t like her voice acting in the remake  and it s not really her fault  it just didn t seem to fit well. i may not like it but personally attacking her for it is disgusting and uncalled for. same when they went after laura bailey for playing abby in tlou2.
i would think ada wong is more ethical person. that she would have an accent. i might be wrong. other than schwarzenegger and jackie chan hollywood does the opposite of what the antiwoke people normally complain about.hollywood tends to favor all their actors to have perfect english. even the british or australian accents are just added with zero phrases and words common to them.
the voice-work wasn t great. but criticism  constructive or otherwise  is a different thing to harassment. i m glad that article brought up laura bailey as abby  too  laura didn t write the character  she just played the role she was given   quite well  as per usual for her. she deserved neither slander nor harmful harassment for the part she played. with both ada   abby  neither hate should be targeted towards the actresses but the ones who hired them. the story in the second tweet-reply  3 29  is the one i heard  capcom didn t want jolene back as she was now unionized. instead of forking over the cash  they decided to cut some corners   hire the cheaper actress  who played ada in 2021 s  welcome to raccoon city    who had less experience voice-acting.8 58 i actually quite enjoy listening to your voice.  it has a subtle southern lilt to it i rather enjoy hearing.
i actually like her voice and performance  it s my opinion and i dont give a damn what you think about it
this sort of toxic positivity is incredibly tiresome. no one and nothing in life is perfect. there is almost never a performance that could not be improved. most agree that this performance could have been improved drastically and having listened to side by side comparisons of different ada voice actresses i can objectively add my voice to the chorus saying that this performance was sub par.was all of that lily gao s fault  no.was some of it her fault  yes.either through not doing her homework on the character  likely   poor direction  a lack of va talent or any combination of these issues.trying to drown out objective criticism with toxic positivity either in a quest for thumbs or a feeling of virtue is all too common all over the internet of late and it is incredibly tiresome. it is not helpful  to anyone.
@james  let me get this straight.  i m toxic because this is my favorite version of ada   because i love the costume  the voice and the way she carries herself   sounds a little weird to me  but ok.
@mfcypher  i ll let you get it straight. feel free to try again if that s what you d like to do. so far you have chosen not to  and have instead written what is most likely to be wilful ignorance. seems a little weird to me  but ok. maybe try reading past the first sentence. your response would imply that you ve not yet done so.
@james  so now i m toxic and ignorant because i like the new ada   still seems a little weird to me  but ok  i think we re done here.
@mfcypher  your mind had apparently reached capacity after reading one sentence. i gave you the opportunity  as i said i would. you have let yourself down. i hoped for better. truly a disappointment.
@james  i m truly hurt.  even if i didn t like the new ada  i wouldn t spend this much time complaining about an npc that has less air time than krauser.
doesn t matter  her voice just doesn t fit  no direction would change that. and from what i ve heard she s given the same bland delivery in everything she s been in  so there s not much a voice director could do if that s who they re stuck with and that s all they re getting from her. apparently she played ada wong in that return to raccoon city movie that recently released  which is why they hired her. everyone says the movie is terrible and i ve heard her acting was just as bad in it.
it certainly not my favouriite version...but its not the worst. imho its not as bad as  ruining the game .
i feel like my phone processor overheated and failed to load all background objects.
some of these people are just being unnecessarily rude to the va  she was given a job and she did it. yes  it s not nearly as good as in re2 but so what  she delivered what she could. if you want to be mad at someone then be mad at the developers for giving her the role in the first place. i firmly believe every person alive deserves some criticism in their lives  but some of these people are just straight up bullying her. some of these gamers are fucking spoiled brats.
i thought she did a fine performance.  yes she sounds different.  but i do like that she voice sounds slightly deeper and more mature in a way.  she doesn t sound fake sexy like some of you sound like you wanted.  i think she pulled of that i need leon to help me but i can t work the same angle like she did in re2r.  in this game she s more subdued in her intentions of manipulating leon because with her interactions with him and how hurt he came off to her.  issues i had with the game in other areas i warmed up to as well.  at first i didn t like leon s hair on the new actors face but i got over it.  i didn t like claire s overly chubby cheeks in re2r but i learned to like it as time went.  you guys forget about all the bad canadian voice overs and actors throughout the years trying to portrait us citizens.  leon s barely holding on to his abouts and a boots.  shenmue 3 voice acting is trash that was left in a time capsule and all the fans love it for nostalgia.  we loved the corny va in the original castlevania sotn better than the remake va even though the remake had better performances.  mgs 4 snake was suppose to be hyper aged yet his voice sounded the same as in his previous iterations shows the range of some actors.  even in re4r we miss the old lines but it is what it is.  we always struggle with wanting the old stuff we remember but not being grateful for what we get in overall quality today.  re4r is one of my games of the year right next to hogwarts legacy and wo long.  in the fighting game series guilty gear  slayers original voice actor passed away and some said the new voice actor is trash just because of this.  crazy.  yes i love the original voice actors but you gotta show love to these people that are putting in work.  they are different people that have different takes.  like characters in media  people can t accept sometimes that their favorite character got a new hair cut  wear different clothes etc..  like you expect ada to wear a red outfit or wolverine to always wear blue and yellow.  leon has to have his leonardo dicaprio hair cut even if all the other soldiers have to buzz cut their hair because it wouldn t be him if he didn t.
she had one job and she failed to deliver. she made the second to last sound more professional than her.
this whole thing is baffling. the amount of times capcom have changed voice actors and even entire character appearances in the franchise is staggering. and up until only recent years  re was constantly memed on for having some of the worst voice acting in earlier entries. as if they picked people off the street and gave them a few bucks to do the va work. people are suddenly clamoring for a code veronica remake as well. has anyone actually played it  probably some of the absolute worst voice acting in any game full stop. it is absolutely wild that this is the thing to send people off the deep end. honestly the internet follows trends and loves it s drama and bloodbaths  so she was just probably a random target. no sane person cares. and i ve been a lifelong fan and player of these games. people really have it so good these days that these are the problems they create. mind blowing.
haters are taking it too far sure new ada voice is not the bes but it  is what it is  and sure capcom  remuve sexy voice even how ashley used to dress.
let me point this out re 2 remake and re3 remake was voiced by fans who happened to be voice actors. for leon  claire  and jill although the remake voices sounded off. you could tell they tried to replicate and add there take on the voice to make the characters there version of the cast. the issue with ada in re4 remake is ada sounds like a one note character like every character seth green voices. if lily gao actually put in some effort her voice could have sounded good. however  she s not a good voice actor and she lacks the training for that role.   i m in the boat whet re revolations 2 had i think alli hallis from final fantasy lightning returns instead of alyson court. in that game just like re6 with ada i feel for ada fans  but in re4 remake lily gao just didnt try to sound mysterious or like a a confident person who speaks in a low range that can sound erotic to some.    while i dont agree with hate. it s clear based on her actions . she is probbly a woke actress who blaimes whote people for all her problems. ignoring she s white so her rant on instagram makes her seem like a major hypocrite.  which isnt new since  capcom has a bad reputation for trying to replace there good actors with new woke voices trying to roll in political points. so  ignoring how dull ada sounds in the remake. all i can say just like leon in re6 . welcome to the club  you get use to it -.-
wow not keeping the same actor is really something
let me put it this way  the bentley bros re4 parody had a much more seductive and charming ada...and it was a guy playing her.
she should sound dangerous and seductive not a robotic karen like gao
i liked her being kinda emotionless because she can t show that she cares about leon or anyone. it was a good contrast to leon s over the top one liners and backflips lol. either way. we don t play the game for va performance  we play for the gameplay. if it was a story driven game that is a different story
speaking of voice actors... i am starting a petition to make melonie mac the new voice of april o neil.
thank you for having a mind
i did not mind her. if people dislike it then criticise capcom instead of the actress. not her fault.
honestly  i think she was well cast. it seems like it was a deliberate move by whoever the voice director was.
i feal bad for the voice actress because i totally cringed when i heard ada start talking in re4 remake
that s why one should hire based on capability and skill  not just based on race and gender sex.
objectively speaking  she s worse than ada s previous vas. but that s relative. being worse than the people who came before doesn t mean she s bad. just  bad compared to  sally cahill and a couple of others who simply did a better job. old school ada was that perfect mix of mysterious  sultry  dangerous. this ada seems like she s punching the clock  and mildly bored irritated at all times. millennial ada. it doesn t help that the moment she got criticism  she cried  racism . and for the record when i see hear a bad performance  my default assumption isn t  bad actor actress . it s  bad director . i ve seen the same actors turn in wildly different performances and that s what made me realize how massive a difference the director makes. if you turn in an average or mediocre performance and the director just says  alright  next scene  then the actor has no reason to suspect their performance was lacking. a director who actually provides...you know  direction...and demands as many takes as needed to get the right performance makes a huge difference.
just uploaded a video using ai to change ada s voice if anyone would be interested in check it out
you just don t mess with the re4 fans they love that game in a very toxic way
claire s voice in revelations 2 and ada s voice in re6 were both done very well and fit the characters pretty well though  this voice for ada is just horrendous  it s unbearable. it s not a big deal to me when they change voice actors as long as the new voice fits and plays the character well.
and if they have to replace her at least find someone who fits the character. they had no problem finding a good replacement for re6 that played the part extremely well  but this new one just doesn t have the voice for ada  and has no personality  it doesn t fit the character in the slightest.
sadly  i believe it.
so if everyone talked like mario characters  that wouldn t bug you even if a game is better for gameplay  i d still want the characters to sound like they fit in the setting and story.
@frank kennedy  in a re game no. any other game yeah. re 7 and 8 had the only decent va imo. old ada was better sure  but new one doesn t bother me
yse  not just because asia  omg
its her voice and she cant do anything about it. this is capcoms fault  they should get the shitstorm for diversity hiring people that simply do not fit the role.gao sounds like she would sound great for female villains in fantasy rpgs.
the problem was never lily s... hell  it s wasn t even capcom to start. it was the fans that got bothered enough to go harass and go out of their ways. the comments you showed that were snapped were all mild compared to some of the stuff i saw before she removed all of them. you got folks telling her she only got the job because she s asian and that the whole capcom going with a different va was because of woke agenda.that s your problem right there. lily gao wasn t exactly great but the comments act so much as if her voice alone killed the entire remake and that shit was just uncalled for
am i being gaslit personally by the entire internet  she sounds completely fine to me. she sounds more like a spy than she did in re2 remake.
in 2023  i didn t like your performance    harassment
in my opinion...1  she deserves the negative criticism about her work  because she did a very terrible job. however  i think the first two comments you show were kind of rude and in a way be considered bullying  because neither of them even make a real criticism about her job. the third commet was perfect because she actually gave a reason and an example of lily s flaws as ada. 2  she doesn t deserve to be harassed or bullied because of it   people have a problem if they don t know how to differentiate that. i can t believe people truly went to her personal accounts to  bully her  like  they don t have something better to do 3  i am of the opinion that her voice is not even the problem  it s her voice acting job  she simply had no clue how to voice a character  and definitely has no clue how to voice ada. 4  if separate ways is coming  i definitely would want her replaced  a good option could be karen strassman  who actually voiced annette in the remake . karen has experience voicing sexy and or mysterious characters like ada  examples of that are sialeeds from suikoden v  shura from soul calibur iv or kitana mileena from mk. she even voiced alexia ashford in darkside chronicles. jolene did a good job in delivering her lines in re2remake  but her range of voice sounded very generic for ada  who had a very unique tone of voice set by sally cahill  re2 4 original  and later followed by courtney taylor  re6 . i always thought karen strassman should had voiced ada  while jolene anderson  should had voiced annette.
you know what sucks about some criticisms and bullying online that was kind of shown around here  1 20.  some people disguise bullying as criticism and people that were on the other end of that will often times see any criticism as bullying  they could also be leftites that are deluded with hubris that think that anyone that criticizes them is some ist phobe suffixed word they have no idea the real meaning of  or they think its fear of them for some reason . i think whatever people commenting on the matter should do at the very least is communicate in some clear enough fashion what she or the appropriate personnel did wrong in whatever amount of @  holery you put in the message  so there can at least be something they can endeavor to correct about the performance she or the devs can do  assuming they ll even listen to it that is  which is either a sign you should get to the point of the message or issue and minimize or remove the amount of @  holery in said message.  there s also the possibility you re wasting your breath  because you re lumped into a demographic that they think are beneath beneath them for the aforementioned hubris delusional reasoning  but it can be worth a try  possibly .my take on this is  that the lines need some work on either the actresses side  the sound directors or a little bit of both  but it doesn t sound like a whole lot of work for either party.  i think lily gao would do well to listen to the original actresses lines and channel as much of the sultry  seductive femme fatale that she s able to or is fitting with the remake.  the criticism may be warranted  but i don t think she did as bad as some might have said.  the great thing about modern gaming is that we aren t necessarily stuck with these problems as modern hardware  software and networking allows the devs to correct this issue and release a patch that puts in the corrected dialogue lines in and the problem can be solved.  however  the problem with modern gaming developers is the question of whether they ll put the effort in to correct the issue or just blow the community off  not that way  as in turning their nose up at them in a snooty attitude kind of way
bro i honestly don t care. i m just buying the game to have it. i will not forgive them for not giving ashley and ada their original costumes.
re2 remake had the option to use the original audio  doesn t re4 have that too
8 45 speaking of your voice. i ve always thought you sound like violet from the incredibles.
sorry  you need to know what a constructive criticism is. in art school   we must take at least three years of classes in criticism  known as art crit. . when you tell someone they ruin something  which is not true   or they suck  these type of  criticisms  is garbage harassment. a constructive  legitimate criticism has an intention to help people better themselves and to improve. when you don t like the va s voice acting  point out the actual issue to help them improve. ie. i also don t like how the new ada voice was delivered  because ada s voice sounds too soft  too friendly  and sometimes too far away from the mic. however  telling someone they ruin something when they clearly put in the efforts is not okay.
i mean yeah... compered to evil 2. that was bad. but we should encourage her to do better. and... yeah the corps tells her what to do
i m not sure if she s fit for va-ing. if her voice would fit a different character or not. maybe but  the directing for her voice seems to be questionable as well. she kind of sounds like she s exerting too much in order to sound expressive  that it just sounds forced and unnatural as her natural vocal cords voice she s developed  doesn t really match the personality type she s trying to convey... basically  something like mike tyson told to sound sophisticated and with a deep voice. pretty much the opposite of his naturally developed voice and vocal cords are used to  and capable of. like with all criticisms  some people take it too far or are much more passionate about the topic  or feel too comfortable being disrespectful because of their anonymous online personas. i ve caught myself sometimes too and had to remind myself to bring it down a notch. like when you re editing your paper  you realize you re sounding a certain way. i think it s important more of us do that as well. sometimes  reflect on your actions not the day after an argument after the fact   but in those moments instead. at the end of the day  though  i think criticisms  no matter how harsh  or flat out disrespectful comments like  you re awful  you suck  f  king terrible  etc.   are still important words of opinions. how you decide to handle  accept  or reject them depends to your mental fortitude and ability to discern yourself.
i didn t hate it while playing too much but next to the other actors and now knowing what she sounded like originally i understand the criticism. i also agree that this should be voiced to capcom rather than gas lighting her on her personal socials. fair take and opinion  maybe you ll bring awareness to how to be respectful and how these situations work behind the scenes. people have no chill nowadays.
i thought she was good. imagine caring that much about it to attack someone for taking a job and doing her best. these fan boys need to cry less and check their test levels.
the french dub is much better. im proudly playing in french this time  it doesnt happen often that the french dub is far superior. both ada and salazar are exponentialy better in french.
her voice isn t for ada wong  that s it.
this is the first i ve heard of her in the game  and it s worse than i expected. i totally get it. man i was looking forward to that part of the game too... damn
so  now people call reading a script voice acting  i feel bad for real vas  their job is being reduced to this if there are people who think lily gao made a good performance.
@seven  it s ultimately up to the directors. they decide if they are happy with a performance or not  and guide the actor  it s an actors job to perform  yes  but they always follow the people making the game or movie  show whatever. in the same way leon sounds different because of his experience over the past 6 years  think about what 6 years of soulless  detached bounty hunting can do to someone s soul. i think it fits.
no reason not to give her another chance  everyone can do better don t she why she would be any different
yes she was terrible. no  it isn t her fault they hired her. yes  given the societal dynamics and platforms we ve allowed ourselves  social media   you have to anticipate a great deal of people can t reason even that much into their dislike of something and will in turn be hateful to someone just doing their job. and unless we want to address the real issue  that social media is cancer and a disgusting freedom we shouldn t enjoy  you gotta suck it up and learn to ignore the trolls. so at the end of the day  anyone feeding them is the ultimate loser. learn to stop checking your feed every 10 minutes and your life can only improve.
hey  melonie i just want to tell you that i do not think that she deserves the backlash for what she did for the remake of resident evil 4 remake video game  ok melonie. anyway the company made the video game and the company made her to do the voice of the character in the game and so i think that she does not deserve the backlash for what she did to do the voice for the video game  ok melonie. anyway i just want to make a comment about this video topic for today  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had a great day today and i hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
yeah play the original.
they should have kept the same voice actress from re2 remake  even if it wasn t as sultry as sally cahill the change to liily gao was just too jarring.
ever hear brad pit in a cartoon. it is not easy voice acting
capcom is woke.  everything about ada and the entire remake is made to push the sjw woke agenda. aka  the message .   this includes the shape of her face   3d model  and her voice. i had no idea about the supposed  backlash .  i just knew that sounded like a woke style voice.   very specific tone.  this is done with people of all races.
critize is needed to improve in the arts. most never personally attacked her. no mention of race  etc
its not the voice - its the performance... the problem is that she clearly is a diversity hire wasnt hired for being good at the job they already had 5 different women do without it ever leading to this kind of pushback. as melonic mac said the re2 remake va wasnt the greatest either and it still wasnt a big deal. some are worse  some are better... but they all performed the same character ..... lily gao was basically just doing a  jake skywalker  version of ada wong...
yeah i m gonna respectfully disagree with your assessment of the new ada wong it s ok not great but ok. can we however unite under the belief that they 100  improved ashley in the remake
so wooden a fine table might be made off her performance
the bullying attacks was bs. just do enough researching of your own  you have a small group of people being mean  yeah  it s the internet. expect it.  but  most people were criticizing the vas work  boy directly attacking bullying her. articles just love to jumpstart arguments with their titles.
i mean it s fair to give out criticism but like always some people take it to far and start harrasing the va.
i don t get it. i preferred her portrayal and i ve been playing re since its inception.
new va  if anything  sounds uninterested with what going on think dinklage in destiny  and lack any real emotion. if anything capcom  should ve kept the original va  and not swap due to  racial difference  backlash. regardless  the people bullying and throwing death threats at her  are complete scum and they deserve to be ostracized and banned and made a mockery of.
it wasn t as good as re2 remake or even og re4 voice actress but wasn t as bad as everybody making out. she sounded bored but ain t ada supposed to sound like she hardly cares anyways there s nothing suductive in the script for her to sound that way
i thought lily gao was decent  but she had no emotional range as ada. i felt like jolene anderson embodied the character way better.
im too traumatized beating the cabin on professional to care about the ada va
i ve had no issues with ada. i quite enjoyed lily. people are being dumb and picky.
melonie  nothing is wrong with your voice just never do ada unless you act. did you get robbed.
she sounds bored out of her mind. did nobody tell her to try harder  didn t they tell her what ada should sound like the criticism is well deserved. the bullying is not.
obviously i don t condone the mob bully mentality towards her  but i do think her performance deserves to be criticized. her performance is incredibly bland compared to her coworkers  who did an incredible job.
bruh the voice acting is lack luster  agreed  but these people are really going over the london bridge. ada only shows up a few times for a few minutes  and because you don t like the va of ada  it ruined the other 99.99  of the game for you
10.09 big ups mucho dan gaming
i didn t have too much issue with the voice acting.  thought it was ok.  i didn t like the design of the character.
i don t think her voice is that bad . i do think it is really flat though
capcom could ve easily brought back one of the better va but choose her. not throwing shade at her personally however this wasn t the roll for her. did capcom not do auditions for this time around
they need a og voice pack.
i don t like the last 3 vas. to me though  ada wong is junko minagawa all the time
from what i heard she wasn t that good. so it was a matter of fact she would get criticism. i think however the people who deserve more criticism  are those who okay d her for the role and okay d her performance. no hate for her  i couldn t voice act my way out of a box  but when people think u don t sound good... you probably weren t good.
my ps4 owning self hasn t had a chance to play this remake but i never knew they switched the actress for race reasons. that s so incredibly ridiculous and it s not her fault for accepting a job. wtf capcom
nope  she s the best ada wong va so far  her voice best suits the character  far better than previous vas  who let s be honest  just sounded like catwoman. lily gao brings something new to ada and it really brings the character to life and gives her more depth and realism  she also sounds more femme fatale than she ever has.
no negativity to the current voice actress for ada  but they should have kept her voice from re2 remake.i m still gonna play ada s dlc
idk  your voice isn t bad.
i happen to like the voice acting.  but my problem is with the fact that ada isn t even in the game as a playable character.  she s a mercenary and she s not even in mercenary mode.  characters that aren t even mercenaries are in that mode  but she s not.  instead of focusing so much on something we can t change  because what do we expect capcom to do  a full global recall of the game and start over   of course not  but we can get ada in the game.  all this complaining destroys games.  just look at anthem and mass effect andromeda.
as simply as possible  i think she did a poor job. maybe she put the effort in and it just didn t meet the demand. sometimes she sounds mid and other times it fully pulls me out
resident evil 2 will always be the better game in the series but re4 is a close second
yes. also krauser s new voice wanted to sound like heath ledger joker for some reason.
must have been a diversity hire  because it definitely wasn t for her skill range in voice acting. interesting enough  the game also includes other languages too  so we can also compare them.
this is definitely not right. she is not deserve the backlash. but still....... she is not good enough to va ada
no  they just hired her because she played ada in the return to raccoon city movie  no auditions. wish they had because i have a feeling anyone else showing up at an audition could do a better ada than this.
or any of the previous voices  or any new voice. this is like the worst possible voice for ada  doesn t fit at all. it would fit nemesis more than ada.
id say yes - the ada from re2r was great - this recent one was pants - jmo - they didnt need to change her... my gf agrees the new outfit is noice though
it will start to grow on you eventually and you won t be irritated by it anymore. the key to getting used to the new voice and face of ada wong in the new resident evil 4 is to play it as it is and not constantly comparing it to the original game. treat the two games as two separate experience and you will be fine with either versions.
she was very bland in the game. she delivered lines like she was reading from the script like they just handed it to her. the hate is warranted to a degree  but she had to have known this with how it was going to play out with the popularity of the original. also  she was a terrible ada in the welcome to raccoon city movie so i don t know why she got hired tbh
personally her performance was bad yes. however  it didn t ruin my experience of re4 as it was great. i wouldn t bully anyone for it tho.
what a joke.
@seven  i m dead serious
did you see the comments that were said to her   btw not defending just wondering
i only played re2r so i never heard ada in the original games she appeared in and hearing remake4 it was so grating.the performance is just awful. it s inexcusable.you should never be satisfied with mediocre products or performances.
she just sounded very robotic and emotionless.. especially the part when she was talking with wesker mid game. still i think its not right to criticize offend her on her ig.
anyone who takes the time and effort to tell melanie they hate her voice is probably the kind of person that hates christmas and puppies lol
personally  i think she did a good job as a voice actress but  her voice did not suit an ada wong character  would more fit a jill valentine than an ada wong
the only reason why they chose her for ada s role is because she played ada in that horrible welcome to racoon city movie.   they should have just sticked with jolene from re2 remake.
no she didnt deserve it  her deep  seductive  sassy tone and voice she brought to ada fit the character so much  also its common sense adas gonna sound different after 6 years since re2 and shes gonna sound more mature serious compared to her re2 version so idk why these clowns are complaining so much
i mean if you think about it it s people that make resident evil it s their fault because they know they were diving into some deep waters when they remade resident evil 4
ada wong in the remake sounds bored instead of intriguing in my opinion. in addition  it s like she s not allowed to be sexy. despite that  lily gao doesn t deserve hate for it. she s just doing her job and was given a bad script. if anyone is to blame  it s capcom.
to be fair it a remake  people always have the original. og re4 is still king.
they cast the actress because she played ada wong in the terrible welcome to raccoon city movie.
i m a long time franchise fan. there is nothing wrong with the new portrayal. i found it refreshingly new. some people can t handle change. i enjoyed it. i don t get what the problem was.
yes.  yes she sounds pretty bad.  i feel that she was badly miscast for this character.
for the question of  did lily gao deserve the backlash for her ada wong resident evil 4 remake performance    the answer is no!!! no actor should be penalized for how they were directed! capcom and the directors of the game should be at fault for not taking the time of day to make sure everything sounded like it should have. if they needed retakes  they should have just done them. another point for this argument is  the fact for this remake each and every character has changed  weather it is their personality  looks  or all of the above. leon in this game has changed from the previous remake into someone who still holds out hope  is stronger with holding in some of his emotions or feelings  and more combat intuitive. with ashley from the original game to the remake  her personality has changed into something that feels like it grows over the entire game  you start out with her being small anxiety filled person into someone who gets more confident within her environment. with ada from the remake of 2 to 4  ada is more receptive of knowing that leon still possibly cares for her but probably knows his feelings are still sensitive after what happened in raccoon city. lily gao s impression of ada wong builds ada s character into a less of a seductress and more of a business only kind of woman. i feel as though ada is more of a different person in the remake with the lines alone. she isn t here to flirt her way through the entire game to get leon s help or attention. ada in this game makes it feel as though she has grown into a harder person since resi 2 remake. she knows how to use people to her advantage and make plans based on the people around her. i genuinely believe that i like this version of ada. the only criticism that should be warranted is that her mic quality could have been better and there were defiantly some lines that should have had a retake. if you disagree with this opinion that is fine. just realize that this is just an opinion.
6 03 i think what you mean is a mature femine voice
capcom not bringing back anderson was idiotic gao was kind of hard to listen to so was krausers va to be honest
i think  even with a better performance  the voice just doesn t match the character model.  it s weird  she kind of sounds like an older eskimo woman.  but i do think some of those comments like  you ruined the remake  are melodramatic and mean spirited  and i feel bad for the actress.  at the very least  those comments should be directed at the people in charge.
she s perfect... for characters who are tired depressed  not mysterious sexy.
utterly outrageous comment.
for a character that you barely f     here say a word throughout the entire series  people are sure bent out of shape over it
she sounds like she s 20 or 30 years older than the character is supposed to be. odd choice...
jolene and sally are the best
and now lily is playing the race card instead of accepting she didn t do a great job.
@ville   obviously not. unless they recorded behind the scenes.
oh alright well did you see the comments of what was said to her on her page though
@ville   no  but from screenshots it looked like majority was hate comments. will i deny that there were possibly more than just that  no  i will not deny that fact. but again  my comment was just my opinion. i liked her take on ada.
so she she deleted her insta
@ville   she privated all of her post.
@lolijustgaming  so she deleted people comments to her
@ville   she deleted privated her own posts.
@lolijustgaming  oh alright well i wonder if people reported those who said bad things to her
exactly  her voice just doesn t fit the character  so no amount of directing was going to make a good ada out of this voice.
jolene andersen was the perfect ada voice. she killed it in the re2 remake and her voice fit perfectly. why they ever picked lily gao because of that godawful re movie i ll never understand.sally cahill was good too but jolene andersen wins for me by a country mile. lily gao sounds like a bored  fat housewife.
there s no such thing a perfect voice actor and anybody that think so clearly has unrealistic standards. as for the voice actress in question  what she had to endure is just an example of how social media have made become toxic and have become nothing but a medium to threaten individuals.
dude  why is the agonist s vocalist voicing  ada wong someone let the wong one in  am i right
even though i m not a big fan of ada wong s new voice actress  she doesn t deserve all of the hate she is getting... she did a great job and people need to stop all of this hate...
bro  i thought she was great ! what is the hate about !! lol she came off as cold  calculated  unreadable!!
people are weird she was good in the game love the new look
maybe people are just too caught up in nostalgia to admit that all these ada voices included the og one just sounds sub-par. she only speaks in one tone and doesn t really convey much emotion. that being said  the worst performance is by far the dead by daylight one to me. personally  i don t have an issue with the new actress voice for her at all. is it the best  no  but it is unbearable to listen to   definitely not.
the voice director is as much to blame.
i don t condone bullying a va but i do support legitimate criticism and i hate to say it but the performance simply was underwhelming  especially compared to the previous ada vas like jolene andersen.
how dare she take the role and you melonie with your low-res video..   2 thumbs up!
tbh i love ada wong i grew up around the character and sort wish i had half the coolness she possessed. now personally i thing the va for the remake was kinda flat she had the potential  but it sound like she was bored and wanted it over when i would give a kidney to play ada wong hehe. but then again i also thought my boy leon was a bit off as well he somewhat flowed to a gruff voice to then a baby voice. thus i wonder if it was the directors or audio producers that mishandled it however glad they chose a better ashley her original va was ear pricing at times
i don t know if her performance was bad. she might have been doing exactly what she was directed to do. she sounded cold . perhaps that s how capcom reinterpreted her. ashley was changed a lot too. but i don t see anyone complaining about ashley because it was a good change. it was a bad choice to change ada no matter who s decision it was. it s not the end of the world though. small blemish on an otherwise fantastic game.
melanie is perfect  d
lily gao deserves criticism. however  there is a difference between criticism and hate comments. criticism  especially constructive criticism  would ve sounded more like  ada wong doesn t sound up to par this time around when compared to previous portrayals like jolene andersen  courtenay taylor  and sally cahill  or  ms lily gao s rendition of ada wong is noticeably the stiffest out of all portrayals of the iconic character. horribly written hate comments  which are what ms gao has received a plethora of  sounds more like  you suck  quit acting    you ruined the game for me    i can t believe i wasted 70 dollars on this piece of shit. i demand a refund    kys    i m putting the whole game on mute   and so on.
we all know they wanted their sexual fan service not the great voice. otherwise why accept wesker s worse voice
this is an april fools  day hoax. these screenshots are the first of any attempt at evidence i ve seen  and they don t even show who they re replying to. everyone keeps referencing the dan allen gaming videos as damning evidence  but they re obviously cherry picked to make her look bad  i hated every line he chose for the video  too  but since actually investigating for myself  i like her the most  and by a large margin. she has an excellent voice  she just kind of missed on a few lines.
i think she doesn t sound bad its just she sounds different and doesn t sound  powerful which represents the character ada wong...... but technically speaking...that is how an asian should sound ...
still waiting for the bad part on gao s voice.
gao is asian  right  that s supposed to mean she was the best possible outcome for voicing ada  right  that s what they all say anyway.oh wait  you mean race is completely irrelevant to the quality of a vo  nonsense.she gets no empathy or sympathy from me after she left her racist diatribe on instagram after deleting everything else on her account.
and advantage of non-english versions  they can still use others ada s voice more suitable and in their home language. english version in this case i agree  it s totally shit  i prefer the 2 fisrt ones and even the 2 remake one. luck for me i m not english american and don t play in english dub  x
did you see the comments that were written to her
@ville   before she deleted her instagram  yeah. lots of hate on top of criticism  praise  and more hate.
@ville   mostly just the whole  i want a refund thing  or  you ruined this triple a experience for me . the situation caused a civil war in the comments section prior to her ig accounts deletion. lots of people calling the ones who liked lily gao s performance as  delusional liars . as for anything graphic  i believe that is reserved for the dms that lily gao may have received.
@dan  it seems alot of misinformation is going on i just am confused if there is more screenshots to this
@ville   there s 4 that are allegedly direct replies to her  but they re cropped to not show who or what they re replying to.
i seen those and yeah that is true also is there more screenshots then those 4
because i have no idea if there is more or no
@ville   not that i ve seen.
her voice isn t that bad  they ruined way more important things in the remake
i don t see a single thing wrong with those comments  i also don t see a problem levelling them at the actress. she did subpar work and should be told as such.
no one cares about how ada sounds only how she looks and hot dam did she look fine in the remake
i just heard about this.  i finished the game and never once thought to myself she sounded weird.  guess i don t pay that much attention
she wasn t bad i just don t understand the change  i replayed re2 and re3 before going into 4 and it s jarring as hell. bullying the actress is ridiculous it s whoeever made the dumb decision that s at fault!
wow without the animation this sounds horrible. i finished the game and i thought well i don t remember to much about ada but after hearing the comparison she definitely did a bad job.
honestly  you either gotta be an ada wong superfan or extremely horny if you think this ruins the whole remake.... is this my favourite ada voice  or even rendition  no  admittedly i dont even mind gaos voice that much  i think shes fine   but youre acting like it makes the game an absolute dumpster fire.
me starting the video and hasn t played the remake yetit can t be that ba.... yep it s that bad. there is no need to be going to her socials though. she just didn t fit the role and that s on capcom not her.
in all honesty i don t think the va was really that bad. some of the other va s found worse  especially the dead by daylight and i didn t really care for resident evil 2 remakes ada... i honestly made fun of that ada along with leon.but that s just my opinion of the whole situation. meanwhile  ada is supposed to be disconnected and playing mind games in the way she speaks  it s not perfect but i can see what they re doing. and i almost see ada kind of having that dialect. maybe it should have been a better voice actress yet i wasn t really that bothered
did she sound that bad  yeah it was pretty jarring. we have over 20 years of ada and nearly all the voices sound similar or their delivery except for this one.she shouldn t have been casted but does it ruin the game  hell no. i love ada  she s my second favorite just behind leon. the actress doesn t deserve the harassment.
this games is fantastic. haters be stoooopud
her acting was absolutely the worst part of the remake for me. i loved this remake  but yes  she did not hit the mark. i also wasn t the biggest fan of krauser s voice actor choice either  but there was still more feeling and emotion in it. i feel like krauser s voice was higher pitched and ada s voice was lower pitched.
lily s performance wasn t good flat out  it was dry and felt like she didn t care about the role not really giving the character justice lost the sexiness of the character and the mysterious nature . that doesn t justify being bullied  criticised yes but people shouldn t take it to bully her and fyi why the past actress wasn t hired it was because she was unionised  not because she was a different skin colour
she could be ableto play the role my opinion because why notstop being lazyscout out and about
i think you re voice is cute melonie. i probably think that mostly because i have a crush on you  but i think your voice is fun and upbeat. it s really nice.
yeah but its really capcom who hired her and found her work acceptable. maybe that s the best she could do and never should have been given the part in the first place. i think her voice just doesn t fit ada so there s nothing she could have done to make it good.
@jack m  then maybe research the character and don t do it if you can t  or try your best at least. how come people were fine levelling this amount of hate to chris pratt and others but this is a no go
@nunya buziness  i just watched a  voice comparison  video.  yeah  she delivers her lines a lot different than in previous games  but geez ....i can t imagine going out of my way to care about it
ok  i see now. her voice is actually wayyyyyy off compared to the others. i noticed they tried to give her more of an asian sounding tone throughout the performances  but when they actually got to an asian actor  it fell completely flat. it s one of the most unpleasant voices in general  and she sounds decades older than any of the other versions...
she sounded incredibly bored  but she wasnt as bad as the dude who voiced salazar  who sounded out of breath the entire time.honestly this is the worst remake ive ever played in every way. bloated gameplay  horrible dialogue  mary sue ashley  rat louis  clich d sadler  cosplayed krauser  etc.when they said this would be a  modernized  re4  i didnt expect it to be this bad....................
i think we can be critical without being mean.
an idiots take on the situation  i liked lily gaos ada. it was more serious spy and she was funny and had her sexy moments like when she poses in the helicopter or when she calls leon. crazy how an asian woman voices the asian woman and has a hint of an accent and people hate her for it and dog her social media for it.grow up  it is so childish to act like she  ruined  a game
lily gao s voice sounds better then vicky s for sure. 9 34
i thought her voice was the most perfect ada voice ever done. ada is a cold soulless killer working for a psychopath who plans to kill a billion people. it was the most grounded  authentically asian voice for ada ever done. i hate saying this  but old og re fans are toxic children for real.
@what is real  literally  she did femme fatal that was more fatal than femme. god forbid. i also like how ada didn t pull a gun on leon or flashbang him constantly like she did in the og. just the first time to be cutesy with him. she did a good job theyre just used to a white woman voicing ada. sorry but i like the more realistic  way less easy to read version that lily gao delivered.
tbh i don t agree.  i replayed original ps2 re4 to compare with remake and tbh i like remake ada more. i donno  at 1st i thought i don t like new ada but i ve cleared game 4 times and tbh i like her now. she just fits so well with the character they created for this game.
i mean  i love the series  don t get me wrong  and the voices from the recent games have been pretty good...but people are seriously complaining about the voice acting in a resident evil game  it s gonna take a master of unlocking to help open my mind enough to understand that. this criticism is pretty crushing...almost crushing enough to make a jill sandwich.
i think she just sounded bored  not bad ass and sexy like ada has been voiced before. i liked the voice actress from re2 remake.
whoa that lily gao voice actually is f ing awful holy crap.   i agree directing hate at her is the wrong place though.   re2 remake had best voice by far.
i guess im the only one who didnt hate her.
it s really sad and bad that there are some very toxic and mean people. she s a very talented actress and did a fantastic job. whether someone prefer someone else than her it doesn t mean they should attack her
her performance was so good wtf. i actually really enjoyed the new voice of ada wong and i m an old re 4 head from the original gamecube release
she kind of deserves it though. read her ig sometimes.
asian person does an asian voicecaucasian person does a caucasian voiceand if you ask for nuance  you are probably a bigot. oorrrrr  and i m just throwing it out  maybe choose the more experienced people for the job   if someone can perform a pretty amazing and accurate representation of an ethnic accent or language and they have professional voice acting credits  hire them.  i am unsure if lily gao has any other credits besides ada but if ada ended up getting voiced by sally cahill like before  i think quality over  diverse representation of vocal chords  is much more acceptable  at least through sound quality and production standards
no one deserves to be bullying if.
short answer  no.long answer  no.if you want to crucify anyone  do it to the writers and recording director. it s not like a voice actor sits alone in the studio and does whatever they desire.
she doesn t deserve any harassment  but i have yet to see any receipts for that. she did deserve the critique  because her voice is utterly inappropriate compared to the old va. her voice might work for another character  another attitude  but she sounds out of breath  tired  and frankly  overweight. it doesn t matter how she looks in real life  her voice sounds detached from the character of ada.
it s capcom s voice director s fault. voice actors are just the hired guns  so they re just misplaced if anything. the voice director picks and chooses what voice performance that comes out of the characters. people like consistency and it s up to capcom to maintain it. capcom dropped the ball pretty hard on this one. if capcom only hired her to play the character because the actress also happened to be asian while disregarding the performance and consistency of the character...that s the issue. voice work is blind. anybody can voice anything  just as long as their voice suits the role. it s one of the few medium where ethnicity  gender  and age doesn t matter. yet certain ideologies somehow manage to find a way to taint it.
you re voice very much like you..  switch to a different voice that is so sweet.
i really don t get why anyone thinks she sounds bad  i don t know what they re hearing that i m not.
no one is angry with the change from 20 years ago.  we re mad with the change from 4 years ago...
i m more disappointed in her new face model  she looked incredible in the re2 remake  now she s just... eh. they made everyone look too old  and she has nowhere near the amount of presence that she had in re2 remake either. both her and ashley have no significance on the story  even though the whole point of the game is to safe ashley. they both have very few voice lines  so why people are being stupid about this shows their delusional fanboy-ism for re4. this is re4 remakes story in a nutshell  spoilers if you get triggered easily   leon shows up  leon says something  enemy wave 1  leon says something  enemy wave 13  leon finds ashley  enemy wave 43  leon loses ashley  enemy wave 114  leon finds ashley  enemy wave 165  leon loses ashley  leon says something  rinse and repeat for another 10 hours.also  this is what happens when you prioritizes matching the race of the performer with the fictional character.
some people like to complain about stuff just to complain!
does anyone else remember when people would actually got more upset over things that actually mattered
wow now i understand if i dont get first voice or the second voice so put the remake 2 voice back in re4 remake at least the voice is better than lily gao.
her voice sounded 2 dimentional  boring and a bit shaky especially when she says  oh leon  unlike the original va who had a strong smooth voicei really wasnt exited to meet her in the re4 remake like i did with re2 4 and 2 remake
it s horrible and robotic
i don t think they are hearing anything  really  they just dislike the change and are expressing it as  bad voice acting .  i don t think most people have the ability to discern the subtle differences when between two voice actors when they are both pretty good. imo  when it comes to the acting itself  it wasn t bad at all  i d say it was more natural and more convincing than all the others listed here. e.g.  the re4 og voice acting doesn t quite sound like natural speak  more like a 90 s cartoon character - but maybe people got used to that. re4r voice acting is simply different  and i guess some people felt strongly that it didn t fit the character. that s more a matter of casting and direction  though.
@filip milovanovi   - she certainly sounds fine to me  wee bit aloof and bitchy but slightly sultry towards leon  and i think it works fine.i might be biased though and heavily influenced by how she looks i get the impression this is people whining just to whine or as you say  just because it s different.
@matt graham  yeah. i understand some people might not dig it  but i was surprised by the amount of backlash. and to feel compelled to express that frustration on the voice actor s social media profile is beyond me.
@filip milovanovi   it s bad because it s not in line with any other rendition of the character which is important. imagine watching a show and the main actor is liam neeson then part way through he gets replaced by a 4ft tall asian man with a lisp. it would be pretty jarring and silly don t ya think  obviously i over exaggerated ut you get the point.same goes here we already have an established character with re2 remake voice and the voices of the past and we know adas persona i d femme fatal. not karen asking for the manager
@ryan wood  i understand what you re saying and where you re coming from  but you re just essentially repeating what i already wrote.  it s bad because it s not in line with any other rendition of the character  - that s another way of saying that you don t feel it fits the character and that you don t agree with casting and direction. that s different from acting itself being bad.
@ryan wood  - i don t think she sounds like a  karen  at all  and her aloof tone overall but slight sultry tone towards leon fits the femme fatale vibe just fine.in comparison to re2 remake i don t really have a preference  but in regards to the original re4 i vastly prefer the remake voice and think the re2 and 4 remake voices are closer to each other than either is to the original 4 voice - i don t think any are bad though  and that s the point myself and filip are getting at  her performance isn t objectively bad  she sounds fine  but so many are treating their preference as objective and then we have the idiots harassing her.
melonie is so fine.
sultry would sound right for a femme fatal
and this is why i m not on socials anymore except yt.
omg this is just funny she was barely in the freakin game
ohso they changed the vo from re2 to re4   didnt knew.she was pretty good in re2re4 ... she looks kinda weird  worse... i dont like her looks. but i dont mind that much her voice in re4... it is real that in re2 her voice sounded better tho
i thought it was alright  i mean she doesn t have to be lady demetrescu.
that even isn t her fault its the style hiw she supposed to say it she say something and the other say yes its ok pass it trough.
i knew it.
it doesn t have tobe just animation..
nothing against lily but she sounds  sleepy  instead of that femme fatale sultry sexy spy voice. its valid criticisms but some are kinda mean lol. netherless  i don t think she was able to handle it.
she sounds like 80 year old grandmother
do you have godzilla tattooed on your right arm !
a lot of people are over reacting. they definitely over the top about the criticism.
it wasn t that terrible but forget we are i. an era that has to do things a certain way. she could have done a bit better but it s not terrible.
sounds like granny goodness from the justice league cartoons .  ok  she can be criticized.  bullying   not okay.
i didn t like her performance. she sounded tired or bored.please don t harass her though
i actually kinda like it lolol
i am asian and i think the first white lady va was indeed superior and lily was a mis-cast for this character.  they should cast based on merit instead of checking the box
she is not all to blame  honestly the casting director is more to blame imo - the performance was not good though  she sounded bored to me
i disagree. yes her voice does not fit  but she is a voiceactress. her job is to act with her voice. to me her acting sounded flat like she didn t put any effort in her role.as for the account... i am pretty sure she has her role as ada mentioned there to make sure everyone knew she played such beloved character. so she can and will get criticism with it.her racist comment only makes me more sure its fake outrage. she has no problem with vitriol if its from her.
tact is missing on all sides.
she try hard
tatoos high body count
i agree it s bad. they probably gonna recast.  jolene anderson should have been brought back.  nothing will beat sally cahill that s for sure.
let me guess they cast based upon her being asian and not her ability.
the voice was fine not a big deal but the game being heavy censored is bs if i know it was i would not of got the game
melonies voice is best
funny how the one asian voice actress doing ada s voice is the worst sounding of them all
this topic is p   ing me of as a hardcore fan of resident evil define voice acting seriously to what i found i literally searched it and no where it said sounding feminine or masculine but what did say is how many multiple voices they can do again nothing said about sounding feminine or masculine hell there nothing i found about so much as pitch of the voice so that being said we can all agree it s to capture the character they are playing however others voices are more deeper etc than others so you can not expect the impossible of 100  perfection it s like y all you want her to talk in a uwu bloody e-girl voice or something like she s on helium like seriously she captured ada as a character period i lost it when she said something like  nice moves very smooth  that drove me crazy that i found sexy as hell again she captured adas character fine. coming from someone who s played like every single resident evil game and seen all the films including the cgi ones this is best ada to date in my opinion personally fight me lol i ll die on this hill
the criticism was fine her performance was lazy. the harassment isn t fair.
wow so glad i am not playing the english version.
voice doesn t seem that bad to me. it s whatever. but as usual in internet-land  people freaking out screeching over nothing.
your voice is fine   it s normal
why do these idiots go after the vas  they didn t write the script or set out to change something you liked. they just took a job. go after the devs or producers directors if you have a problem. in the recent final fantasy cc remake zacks va was so annoying but i didn t look up the dude and harass him.
sally cahill can t voice ada wong in 2023.  she s not asian.  because that s super important for voice actors.
lily gao did nothing wrong however crapcom screwed up with their woke censorious redesigns of ada and ashley
she sounds like tommy wiseau . she isn t a bad actress  though. voice acting just isn t her thing...
9 05  it s awful indeed! the worst. it reminds me what  an old lady ! it s not even worse only because is not loud.
let her cook  same with wesker
the voice actress is no fem fatal.
buck up buttercup. she couldn t handle the heat for a poor performance. just listening to past ada wong  she could have taken inspiration from there. i do not believe she did her best. you can hear her in racoon city and her canadian shows  she does not have a great voice  especially for voice acting
holy hell  why does lily gao sound like an old lady in her role as ada wong
she just kind of sounded plain to me  i guess  and that never really fit ada s character...the character struck me as a sort of asian nina williams  from tekken   and that s not exactly what i got from that performance.
melonie i do like your voice
ada wong could sound like barry white and still be sexy as fuck. her va was awesome  thougb.
happy tuesday melonie mac
acho voc  bonita e divertida. gosto.
no but the casting director or whatever.
no charisma  it s the one thing i noticed in the remake  ashley s voice actress was really good.
why do they recast  why not just use the old voice lines
she was mid
you finally let down that beautiful hair
hey  sweetheart  you do such a great job! i hope you know that
lol lets be real  people who play dbd don t care about the voice actors.
what clothing store changing room are you doing this video from
i do not find a voice match with her role either  yikes.  i do agree capcom should receive the  criticism directly.
i think she did a good job  she came across as more mysterious which i liked
i don t see anything bad
her voice acting was absolutely sub-par and robotic. if that was the best she could do  then capcom is to to blame for not choosing a better performer. she sounded so bored and uninterested imho.
yes her performance was awful  pretty monotone and stale  doesn t sound like a professional voice actor at all.  edit  which i just found out is the case  which explains a lot   so yes the criticism is fair  of course don t go directly her profile and @ this shit towards her  people should more so be criticising capcom in the first place for hiring her.
i like your voice
i don t like the new va personally  but she didn t deserve harassment that much bro c mon now. criticism is valid but not blatant hate.
i didn t even know you released new videos your not in my feed anymore i had to search your page up .
its like they hired her just cus shes asian and kinda looks like a wong  just doesnt sound like an ada wong
honestly  the actress is great and does great. it s the direction she s given and what they were looking for that ruins it. i was expecting sultry and bad ass  which i didn t get. it doesn t fit with the story of the character.
you have a new appartement or just bored and changed the whole room
dunno why this has to be the moment of right or wrong pertaining to bullying.  when something feels ott  ur feeling is got it right already. why yall making a scene again for nothing  just baloney.
i think her voice is kinda boring and off but ada is a snack so it doesn t bother me much lol in all seriousness  it shouldn t be this big of a deal.  it s only a game.
nah   you gotta cute voice   melonie   sort of terri garr kinda thing going on.
i like your videos melonie  but if i had to give you backlash it would be your interior decorating in this video. what are you going for  an art gallery or museum
she does deserve the criticism  but i also don t like how she started blaming  white privilege . i hope they went with gao because the old va was in a union so she was more expensive instead of  because she s asian too.  i hate that kind of shit.
she doesn t deserve harassment or anything but the voice is extremely bad. its the one misstep of the remake imo.
this was extreme bullying
we can just change it with mod problem solved why need bullied people for something not really necessary if in the end we enjoyed the game with some mod...
i will be playing separate ways in mandarin
her voice sounds good but to me doesn t really fit ada at all. lily gao is very talented though. sally cahill nails it for me. beautiful voice. vicky has a great voice but definitely not for ada. hell no lol.
independent contentis differentgroup content obviously is something else
i mean it not the best but it was not bad either
i had no idea how bad the voice was until the comparison.   it was off a cliff to the new actress.  like... sonya blade being voiced by rhonda rousey bad.
no  she didn t sound anywhere near that bad people just need something to bitch about the remake is 1000 times better than that original and no amount of bullshit talk is gonna make a lot of people go back to the original which a lot of people did not like the game played in the original  and the story was cheesier  which they made the story in the remake more serious  and more flushed out
p.s. i know you are in a transition  just joking
i don t know but she should be my girlfriend..... sounds like she has a good heart
there s literally nothing wrong with her voice  ada s an asian woman  now she s being voiced by someone that s asian and not white now people wanna bitch about it  people find anything to complain about
i m sure some of the criticism comes from people she has offended with past comments  but her voice acting isn t all that great either. i don t think your voice is annoying  you just sound a bit like a mafia princess and it works well for your channel.
lily gao was the best sorry but the others are kinda eh. she sounds real for once. i think people just like jumping on a hate train. lily gao is goat. i said what i said.
she didn t sound as good as the re2 remake but whatever. she s in the game for like 5 minutes  the losers acting like her voice ruined their experience are just strange or want to complain just for the sake of complaining.
i can t believe i m saying this i just skip every scene ada is in the next time i play re4r will be in japanese cuz i do not want to suffer
play this video at 1.5 and you get brett cooper
most of the voice s where pretty bad. the worst being krauser. he went from a tough  gruff man  to a  rawr  i m a bad guy!  voice. salazar s voice also really bugged me. the way the voice actor didn t open his mouth for half of the words  was pretty irritating. fun game  but the voice acting was not good.
if your director tells you to act a certain way and you don t know and aren t exposed to any of the source material  you wouldn t have the context to know how bad you sound.
she is a terrible ada in my opinion  and she has to make peace that not everybody is gonna like her as ada. i do wish the previous actress had been able to reprise the role  but i guess she had schedule conflicts or demanded more   in addition i think lily gao is also a racist.
it sounds like this voice actress is speaking with her teeth clenched together like a ventriloquist.  she needs to express more emotion in her  acting .
i dont think it was that bad. it s just a bad mic and sounds like she s in a cave.
i would have hired the best candidate for the job. not because her skin matched... and i m asian myself. she was horrible in the movie  even more so in the game.
because its nothing to do with race. kratos is voiced by a black guy yet he does it perfectly. ada in this game doesn t even have a voice that fits the ada from the previous remake which is cannon to this game
i think she sound better imo.
not my ada
i didn t care for her voice at all. did it break the game for me  no. does she deserve harassment  no. but i also kind of don t feel bad for her after seeing that post on her instagram about  white privilege .
even if she was bad doesn t mean you should harass someone gamers are losers.constant messages like this are ridiculous why you think its ok is odd
original re4 ada wong voice  h cup remake re4 ada wong voics  flat
the most important part is that she is chineese  rest doesnt matter
melonys been robbed lol. ada voice actors acting was pretty bad. she was just reading off the script. no emotion or character to her. a lot of valid criticism for sure. but this just shows look for good voice actors not color when it comes to voice acting.
oh yeah it s that bad.
i have a feeling this casting has a lot to do with woke culture she s clearly not right for the job. that being said they could of found a asian that better suited the casting if they wanted to. the voice doesn t even fit the look of the character and the delivery is so dry it s not ada wong at all.
lily sounds like joan cusack. i think she did her job  but she wasn t a right fit. she doesn t deserve that hate.
lol not gunna lie it kinda just sounds like they didn t like an asian accent on the asian character.
it s not her fault  blame her fuckin voice   those fan boys want it the same as the original
no she didn t and i think people should just leave her alone  this is stupid
kwasade for the algorithm.
no matter which way you look at it  her voice is a complete mismatch for ada wong.
you try to be fair in your responses  that i can see
maybe asian va is a limited pool . you know they want asian to check those box
agreed bad casting also disagree not a job she should have taken not even for money it is re4 this will follow her like 5-10 years so not worth the peanuts she got paid in
her va did kinda suck
she is a leftist  she probably wanted ada wong to sound like a strong independent woman. now ada sounds like a man. if that s the case  she deserves the criticism and the bullying. also as some comments mentioned  i m aware it s not just her fault. the director or whoever reviewed this should be blamed too  probably even more than the actress.
honestly she d make a good lois on family guy. the sexy appearance of ada and that terrible voice just didn t match for the character. she was a bad choice now the remake of part 2 was a good ada
she sounded like low quality ai
don t see any personal attack. they re attacking for the poor job.  it sounds like 1 session and done. director should be slammed as well.. it sounds like a rush job vs trying to get it right.i critize the japanese leon as well  i didn t think his voice suited as well. but is it harsh  sure  but it was an easy gig..learn from it  grow. improve.  you can t yesmen  that s why so much acting these days are
she sounded terrible  but no reason to bash the actress on a personal level.  there just wasnt any effort put into the lines.
constructive criticism is not bullying
it really sounded like her performance was ai.  completely monotone verging on boredom.  the poor performance was brought to light when you played some of her scenes against the same scenes from the original.
her voice acting sounded like she took the role to just pay her bills. no passion  monotone and sounded bored
about your comments on your voice. i get it. my voice is also terrible xdplus  indian accent  which is one of the less sexy ones out there.as for lily gao as ada.... i dunno. she sounded okay to me  but i can see why long time fans would dislike it. i certainly would  if my favorite characters were badly recast. still  capcom is the one to criticize in this situation.
05 51 i dont hear that word right. can someone write me what she said femty or fem-tey  dont undersand that word right. thanks in advance!
it bad as the original in my personal opinion.  i recently replayed re4 before the remake. but the bullying it not worth it for her mental health.
she took a job. go after the director  not her.
i don t care who does ada s voice. i ve never liked that character anyway.
70  of the resident evil community are feral freaks
gao sounds like she s having trouble using her lungs. the voice and the inflection on here words is so bad.
ada sounds bad in the remake. i immediately caught it in her first line.
is everyone here just forgetting she played ada in the live action and got nothing but praise yet somehow y all have a problem with her voice now  make it make sense and grow up
it s not the fault of the actress  she wasn t the right person for the role but the company chose her  they are responsible for the casting.
cortana
i haven t taken a look at the game yet  so i thought people were exaggerating... yeah no. that performance was terrible.

the voice over was fine. who are all those baby s whinning about hese stupid things
@ville   melonie has posted several in this video.
4 screenshots   wheres more
@ville   why are you asking me
because you gave me useless info thats nothing question i wanted was is there more screenshots then this
soldiers where just doing their job too haha. in all seriousness if i was doing a role i d want to check it out first and at least try to mimick it or not take on the role at all.
i think the animal in the background is based
i thought it was just me not really liking the new ada s voice. it just sounds bland. there s no confident feminine sound in her delivery. i wanted the re2 remake ada back because that what was recently in my head but the original actress sounds the best. i don t play dead by daylight but that actress  voice was trash  for ada at least.
i liked her. i don t know why she got so much hate.
i m asian and i think lily gao had to sound less stiff. she sounded like she was just reading the script. there s no passion in her voice. damn  she needs some major improvement
why melanie what is your empty
her performance was meh in re4r in my opinion. some criticisms are on point but she doesn t deserve the harassment.
@ville   what the bullying or the praise
the bullying was there any screenshots  or did you see what was said  if so was it graphic at all
@ville   i saw death threats. i don t know about people personally attacking her race. but it s also not my place to speak on what she could have been seeing as she had millions of comments directed at her for this game and i mean her post were taken down  first she turned her comments off but from my knowledge people then just moved to dm ing her so she removed all her post. posted the last post and then deleted instagram and social media entirely
oh okay i see damn well what about the praise is there screen shots of that
@ville   hell if i know  you can just go looking for it yourself  reviews on her movies and shows are still up  why are you so obsessed with screenshots of readily available things online   i mean i get the stuff that was taken down but many people have already seen it and other then that the reviews on things are still up you can go on the game reviews and see many people bash her for being asian and somehow bringing up her race in their reviews something i just saw when i went and looked myself   people bullying her for the way her voice sounds. people attacking her physical appearance which is weird sense this is a game and she isn t even in it. heck many even 1 star voted the series. based off her vocal performance alone just because it quote  didn t sound like the original ada    gamers just can t be pleased because realistically they are going to keep getting or hiring the same va every game or movie and clearly they are going a different direction with ada so the hate isn t going to change anything. after all this crying and harassing gamers have done ada is still getting her own downloadable content
well i dont care about the screenshots i was just wondering as i have not seen it since i was late to the situation   but so she deleted peoples replies
she was not fit for ada wong s voice
more like ada wrong
i thought she still sounded seductive. people just like to bitch.
tweak..  your voice
the race of a voice actor actress should  for the most part  be irrelevant. only first generation immigrants have an accent really. american english is american english.
melonie  im gonna criticize you so fucking hard... jk  ur doing pretty good. keep it up.
she made it about race  she blamed white supremacy for the backlash to keep her career  that s why the account is closed now.
simple answer is absolutely. she s an extremely weak voice actress  not the quality that should have ever been used for a product so important
her performance was instantly off-putting just from what i saw in the trailer  it s no different in the game. her voice is dry and the entire performance sounds literally phoned in  like it was recorded using different hardware. she sounds bored and doesn t have the mannerisms for ada and the tone of the voice doesn t match her at all either. probably the worst part of the remake honestly. the criticism is warranted.
her voice sounds dead flat   i have not played resi 4 yet  i m still playing hogwarts legecy which is the wokest game i have ever played in my life   listening to them voices side by side though she sounds dead  i still think it s better than 6 and dead by daylight ada with resi 2 remake voice not far behind them . i don t no like i said i ve not played the game
her voice is fine but the mix sucks. the original voices were over-acted and off-broadway
voice itself is fine. it s just a very flat delivery imo.
no one  literally no one will ever be like sally cahil and courtenay taylor. ada is lacking her charming on her voice and the acting wasn t good... i feel sad for lily but... her work wasn t good.
short answer is yes. long answer is fuck yes.
lily gao voice was bad  lmao.  i was thinking it couldn t be that bad at first until you played it.reminds me of this  rap  from a game called genshin impact  hope you don t mind me linking a video   https   youtu.be yzwborpbrssthe funny thing is the actress is a ok singer but the lines they wrote for her were terrible.
sounds like she phoned it in. it s so extremely flat
no  the game has a more serious tone and she did fine. this is an example of why we can t have nice things  because people ruin them with their bullshit. everyone just needs to calm down. i don t like the woke bullshit more than anyone else  but for fucks sake  leave this game alone and leave the actors alone. they all did a great jobs including the actress in question. be more mad at the writers  for taking out certain lines that they deem sexist.
the race casting is ridiculous  it s a voicing job. what do they think an american asian sounds like  broken rice accent  if they spoke english their whole life  they are gonna sound like any other person who grew up in the same place. you won t be able to tell i m asian if you can only hear me speak french. casting should go back to cast people who sound like what the director has in mind  not a checklist of pc hire
from what ive heard from clips they really shouldnt have hired her her voice doesnt fit
whats with the empty room
it ll only be empty temporararily
@melonie mac go boom  i did notice your cat made an appearance towards the end  but was within the dof
love you
just looked her up on instagram and she has one post  an anti-white one. shocker
she sounded flat and monotone to me like she was reading a shopping list.
it s very robotic.
bro she was bad it didn t go with her
omg here goes gamers crying about bs again
lol i was angry with how trash the merchants va was.also love how we cant have a white person voice a asian but having a black person play wesker is progress
her voice was terrible for ada
she was a tad wooden imo
wow that is bad. i didn t know anything about the voice acting before this. she sounds like she just doesn t care enough to even try to voice the character correctly. elon musk would do a better job at voicing the character  he s more emotional than she is.
i hear gao s performance and in my minds eye i see a 50 year old middle aged white walmart employee. she didn t do a good job. her performance didn t fit the character.
the voice was fine  i still disliked her character. ada is so annoying. that has nothing to do with the character voice.
is her insta still up
i don t see what the problem is  her acting was just as bad as that weiner they hired to replace rick gomez in crisis core  revisited
i d even take sally cahill again  just not lily gao. the wokies try to make it about race again. always an excuse for incompetence.
she was super bad. godamn.
yeah the new ada wong va was very bland and totally unremarkable. it doesn t fit ada s character whatsoever.
weird people are so weird   just play the game   or change language if you prefer french voice .  harrassing is bad and stupid the game is out   they cant change this.  omg ppl
hers and krausers both were bad. hers was just dead and lifeless  and almost monotone  krausers just felt so forced
it was a terrible voice it sound nothing like the voice in the last game re2r and it didn t feel natural for her character the last actress in re2r was perfect she sounded seductive but it s also not the new actress fult
both leon and ada sound awful in the remakes to me
she did fine.   the problem is the previous va was worlds better  and the change was absolutely unnecessary.    well  unnecessary for normal reasons...
ada wong got nerfed. she s not as sexy or amazing as the original re4.
i thought she sounded like a legit asian   as racist as that may sound  i dont care   i think the problem is our society is filled with too many entitled pussies....but to be fair  she really wasnt all that seductive tho
yes  she sounds really bad.
for me sounds bad i am hardcore  re4 fan
i ve no idea who the voice actress was is  but the voice acting was fucking terrible and ruined ada wong for me. she was always one of my favourite characters and she was just awful in the remake. i even played with the  original sound   fx  but idk what it s supposed to change because the music sounds basically the same and the sound effects i can t see any difference with. idk if she s a good actress in other stuff or what but yeah  jesus christ the voicework for ada was absolutely pathetic in the remake. so sad.
no we don t hate lily gao she did what she was payed to do we hate that capcom made ada wong a bigger feminist brat than the last one.
i thought her voice was fine. the voices for sadler and krauser were awful. they didn t match at all  yuk!
personally i never liked ada wong  and her new voice sounds bored and lifeless  making her even less interesting than the original. obviously harassment is not cool  regardless  but criticism is not harassment.
i m playing re4 now and it s a great game but when i got to ada wongs cut scene my first reaction was . ew. her voice acting is terrible.
yes  i heard from multitude of people. the game is great  but dear god did they fuck up her voice.....when you are one of the few blatant fuck ups in an otherwise impressive product... people going to point it out... alot
@melonie mac  ya stopped yerself from sayin  it  but there s no denyin  it.. her voice is flat and does not fit ada wong s character.  so that s weird.. your voice isn t weird  as it fits your happy-go-lucky  honest character. see the difference here
her voice is not so good as adas voice normally sound .what she don t deserve so much hate . blame crapcom.
lily gao is a bit monotone and sounds like she s talking mid yawn
not bullying her but her voice is just bland it s like she s just reading it off the page think when will this be over
definitely bullying. there was no reason for them to be this rude directly to her.
fake news.  this is fake  harassment  to cover up the fact that the customer is not pleased.
nice the result of social justice warriors. they took an chinese woman with a bad voice to be political correct.why cant we have nice things  just pick the woman with the best voice no matter if shes black  white or whatever i dont care. just do things right. or atleast get an asian voice actor with a fitting voice.
the one comment she left up was about how white people should feel guilty for existing  well  she loses any sympathy i would have had.
it s literally unsexy at all  that can t b ada  is zero charming dam if after the second actress they sounds so bad  between dead by daylight and the last one it s literally out of character
no i haven t. i didn t want to look them up. i m certain they weren t anything good lol
it was just awful voice acting. no doubt about that.
the answer is yes !
yes  her voice acting was god awful. there is no emotion in her voice at all! literally zero effort put into that voice acting and it doesn t match ada s character. that s why people are angry.
it s truly awful voice acting. ada deserves better. she s supposed to be the embodiment of the femme fatale  not billy s mom from down the street. her voice is so painfully plain! the backlash is extremely warranted. i don t know if there was any bullying. i haven t seen any. a lot of people these days don t seem to know the difference between bullying and genuine warranted criticism.
yes  she does  she was fucking horrible.some how she was even worse than the ps1 ada wong.  that s saying something.
thanks for nothing in this video i guess
try you for instance
the writing for ada is also bad. she has no personality now. she s an animated carboard cutout who voice is just as stiff. at least the art and animation team did her justice.
same people complaining about a white woman voicing ada also celebrate kratos  actor being black. their only standard  if you can call it that  is hating white people.
hi melonie is that your new room and thoughts on the game sleeping dogs keep kicking ass
what the hell happened to your room !
i agree everyone should complain to capcom about this.
why is it bad.........
eh i don t feel too bad when she tried pinning it on white male privledge
i will put you in the va s shoes. after seeing the video to the end  the video is basically 11 minutes of you showing that you don t know how to give criticism or what a true criticism is. i also have issue with the new ada voice  but it is very ignorant for you to justify clearly hateful  useless harassment as criticism.
horrible performance.bullying wasn t necessary tho.
one thing some people may not be considering is she may have been directed to voice ada this way.either way  yea this should be directed towards those who made actual decisions not the actress herself. bad form.
her performance is just dry
i don t care if it was the most shitty job ever  you don t attack people. this is the same shit that happened to the poor asian girl in star wars. give your opinions to capcom. go write a review.
ugh lily gao is awful i didn t play it yet and now i don t want to
same room  just packed away all my stuff. gonna be a few weeks before i have a cool background again but bear with me  i ve got a lot of stuff i m working on right now xd
@melonie mac go boom you didn t answer my second question thoughts on the game sleeping dogs
sadly melonie is no longer a tomb raider fan. lol. i think she s just doing some cleaning and redesigning. so you ll have to stay tuned.
ada wongs original voice actress was a white woman  despite the fact that ada is chinese. didn t make a whole lot of sense  tbh. this new voice actress is the same race as ada  so it does match.
she s not great let s all be honest. her portrayal was very average but she doesn t deserve hate. she could have been directed better
ok  at first i did find your voice annoying  now  it s grown on me.but i m here for your takes  not your voice lol
the director is obviously to blamethey made a lot of changes that look cringe to me  especially the dialogue
she was awful
lily gao is very bland sounding.
it is bad i have to admit
imo people are just missing her porn actress voice from previous games.
the game overall is pretty bad  like the entire thing is bad.
wow that voice is bad lmao.
she did kinda suck. her voice sounds unappealing and aged. even good vas can t save a bad script and ada had a bad script. ada was always kinda lame anyway.  mysterious lady  that thinks she s catwoman does not appeal to me. honestly hated her in re6.
1st
come on it s ok to not like her but those comments went beyond criticism mel. i wasn t a fan of it either but you can criticize and not personally attack them
her performance was bad.
re4 is terrible
it s very flat
re6 ada is peak ada wdym
