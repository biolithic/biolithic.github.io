it s funny how she called him  annoying  and tried to make him look bad  but she just made herself look like a real witch.
oh this guy sucks because he doesn t let us disrespect the source material  is all i ve gathered from articles like this
sad thing that these woke people don t realize is that every time they attack henry  the more support he gains from sane people  man really is a hero in a legend to our community.thanks for another video melanie  and god bless everyone
every nerd aspires to be like henry cavill. the fact that the woke cult doesn t like him only adds to his charm.
the witcher showrunner lauren hisrich found henry cavill  really annoying  because he was unwilling to misrepresent pervert the character from what was portrayed in the books. fixed it for them.
i wouldn t be surprised if this was the core of the reason dc let henry go. we stand with henry cavil.
it s amazing to me that jenna ortega refused to do parts of the script for  wednesday  because she felt it would be out of character. but when henry cavill does it for  the witcher  he s portrayed as a toxic  insufferable  and controlling. make that make sense.
poor henry cavill he just is a normal dude these people need to leave him alone
henry is literally one of the most talented and passionate people who actually cares about the material  and if i overheard someone calling him annoying for his enthusiasm  i would tell them   henry knows the source material just like christopher lee knew the source material for  the lord of the rings   so i would be listening to him
the best part about all this is that cavill had no negative parting words for the witcher series or its crew  only positive things to say about his replacement.  his conduct was pure class and people notice these things.
imagine taking a meeting with cavill about the witcher  then writing a witcher script whilst auditioning 206 other actors  only to then realize that cavill was the one you needed after all. and then going on to destroy the series so much that he walked away in disgust  despite his obvious love for the story.
so someone being genuinely interested in the project is now called  annoying . that s call passion and is something you should be looking for in your actors when it comes to popular ip projects! also funny how she said  henry cavill is the right man for the role because he was well aware of the source material  then hated how he wasn t on board with all the changes she was making to the ip.
always great to see your videos melonie. elba did a great job in luther  and he seems like he s gotten very based lately. cavill would make the best bond since connery though.
i really like everything i ve seen cavill in. he seems genuinely interested in and excited for things on the nerdy side of life  though  which is a little at odds with many of his contemporaries. here s hoping this isn t the beginning of some weird concerted effort to demonize him and end his career.
i ve said henry is like a king nerd.
this goes to show you just how creatively bankrupt hollywood is
he seems like such a good person that i cant believe an entire industry is willing to put him down that hard because it goes so against their narrative and it pisses them off how genuine and passionate of a person he really is. wow.
this is one of those instances where the guy they want to defame is really an above reproach  good guy  so they cling to stupid reasons to make him look bad. it s like attacking keanu
given how blood origin went  we already know what happens when she s given the reins unchallenged  her and declan de barra .
bashing henry cavill is only going to raise his stock. haven t these people learned yet
the fact that people are now ostracised for caring about source material tells you all you need to know about the modern state of hollywood. they feel like they need to retcon everything to push messaging that would better resonate with supposed  modern audience  demographics  ones that don t actually exist mind you  they just wish did exist would replace actual cinema goers who ve committed the horrible crime of coming from a wide range of belief systems .
most of the coastal hollywood types are smug and mean-spirited.cavill is too good for them  desu.
she d be proud for that label.
@mrgunbunny13  then you must not know he likes teenage girls.
@vertigo  you mean cavill dated a 19 years old adult woman years ago
@daniel schim n  oh a  woman  eh   she was 18 if memory serves me right  still a teenager and we keep skipping over the fact that he was in his 30s. if you were ger father or brother you wouldn t be so happy  if he wasn t a celebrity. just cause something is legal doesn t mean it s good or right by default.
funny  but it s the source material that at least initially gets butts in seats.
@colin davis  illogical. if they want to make money  stick to the source material  and stop altering the characters.
@scott doesntmatter  it s how the mcu became what it did  and it s why the mcu has become what it is  follow and respect the source material  lots of money to follow. disregard it  and watch yourself lose money
@colin davis  they weren t source material accurate with everything but did a fairly solid job with connecting with comic stories
don t forget the part where they wanted to objectify henry cavill and he said no  then they start spreading lies about how he s toxic and misogynistic and difficult to work with women.
@colin davis  mcu succeeds because it sticks to the marvel lore. it also fits with the comics. that s why generally marvel fans love it.the witcher doesn t stick to the lore. they also butchered it with that shitty  prequel story.
@p. whitestrake  it used to. but the reason marvel has fallen off in quality is because they ve literally stopped hiring people who know the source material. nate moore  a producer  said loving the comics is a red flag to them  and that type of statement shows why phase 4 sucked so bad
not really though....like i get it  i get the point  but how is this article a good example  it wasn t making henry look bad  the show runner said he was annoying  henry calls himself annoying  it was all in good fun  never in this particular article did it make henry look bad. this is a horrible example. i m against the woke garbage and attitude of hollywood but the whole video i m scratching my head waiting for the bad part and it never came haha.
@vertigo  really grasping at straws if you have say   yeah  he s within the rule of law  but still!   why do you even care which consenting adults he dates   did you get public approval for everyone you ve dated   if not  you re as  bad  as he is.
@vertigo   i said it s creepy for a man of his age to be going after girls of that age  which it is whether you like it or not. no  its not  creepy  at all  whether you want it to be or not! thats your perception  and you have every right to your opinion or beliefs but please don t project that onto other people. its natural  in fact one of most natural thing in the whole world  i mean she was 19 she was at her most fertile period. period. and he was like 33  as a man he was at his most potent  successful period. as legitimate as it gets. would be a perfect match to each other  to be honest. as this phenomen demonstrated in real life very often  you know that there s a natural age gap between couples right  also you forget that she choosed him too  she s the one who said yes to him. but lets say we just talking about a random 18  yo one  she could be with another 18yo but for some reason she made a deliberate decision to be with a 30 yo man. i believe  i know women  and men  has agency. don t you think   we can t even worry about our children any more. so its really about that  look  they really need to learn on their own  you can t pamper them for life. there is at one point where you as a parents know that they can be trusted to make self preserving decisions.and you know what  honestly  if i would be a 18yo who reads your comments right now i d quite appreciate it if you didn t decide for me what s creepy and whats not.  thanks mum!
@daniel schim n   no  its not  creepy  at all  whether you want it to be or not! thats your perception  and you have every right to your opinion or beliefs but please don t project that onto other people.  yes it is  just cause you are also creepy doesn t make him any less so. it is indeed creepy and predatory. people at 18 and people in their 30 s are at significantly differently maturity levels. this is simply a fact. its natural  in fact one of most natural thing in the whole world  i mean she was 19 she was at her most fertile period. period. and he was like 33  as a man he was at his most potent  successful period. as legitimate as it gets. would be a perfect match to each other  to be honest.  lol! cancer is natural  tsunamis are natural. there are 14 year olds who look like they are 16-21. appreciating someone is pretty or handsome and actually dating them knowing their age are completely different things. as this phenomen demonstrated in real life very often  you know that there s a natural age gap between couples right   strawman! you love your strawmans  it depends on the age gap and the actual ages of both parties. a 30 year old dating a 50 year old is not the same as an 18 year old dating a 30 year old  cope. also you forget that she choosed him too  she s the one who said yes to him. but lets say we just talking about a random 18  yo one  she could be with another 18yo but for some reason she made a deliberate decision to be with a 30 yo man. i believe  i know women  and men  has agency. don t you think   not many people say no to celebrities  you are not making any point here. so its really about that  look  they really need to learn on their own  you can t pamper them for life. there is at one point where you as a parents know that they can be trusted to make self preserving decisions. maybe you can go after people s kids cause you agree with creepy behavior    most people don t. no decent parent will tell you they are comfortable with their teenaged daughters dating men in their 30 s. and you know what  honestly  if i would be a 18yo who reads your comments right now i d quite appreciate it if you didn t decide for me what s creepy and whats not.  thanks mum!    did i suggest any laws be made  another strawman.
@vertigo   not many people say no to celebrities  you are not making any point here. i did. i said  she could be with another 18yo but for some reason she made a deliberate decision to be with a 30 yo man  not celebrity i said  30 yo man   a random ordinary man. again  people at 18 already has agency. did i suggest any laws be made   i suspect you really want those laws to be made. but anyways  i ll keep dating 20-something yo women because i get older and these college girl stays the same age  and you ll keep paint decent man as  creeps . all the while the world keeps spinning.
@wind of change  he isn t a good person  he likes them young. he is right about the witcher  sure  i agree but that s it.
@vertigo  nah  wrong logical conclusion. just becase a man like them  legally  young it doesn t make him a bad person  just like because a woman like them older it doesn t make her a bad person either.
@vertigo  most couples on the planet are with a male older than a female  she was adult and that is that. we should all only ever love someone exactly our age  we get it  you do not like him and that is ok but implying someone is a pedophile for dating an 18 year old is single dumbest thing i have heard in awhile. ask 18 year old chicks if they want someone their age or in their 30s
@mandalorian crusader  exactly.
@abloodangelterminator  if facts are dumb  then sure i guess.
@daniel schim n  no  exacxtly . i read your latest reply and you just repeated yourself lol! you have gone nowhere.
@jeremiah torrevillas  communist  lol really there kid
did she try and make him look bad    i didn t get that from the article at all  henry even called himself annoying  i think it was all in good fun. i get what the video is saying like this happens and it s sad hollywood hasn t realized they will make more money pleasing the fans. this article no where did the word annoying mean something bad  the show runner was just saying he was super passionate she wasn t saying he was horrible to work with  again henry even called himself annoying. i feel this is out of context and a bad example.
@vertigo2894 so   my wife is 19 i m 33. she from philippines and is more mature then half the girls in america my age. i was put off at first by her age but it really depends on the situation and ppl invovled  everyone is different backgrounds and acts differently. many women in the philippines go for older men  the women are raised differently there. i mean if he was dating this girl and they had a father daughter thing going then you could say that it was weird. again everyone is different  throwing out things that you find weird doesn t apply to everyone in every situation.
@daniel schim n  is there anything relevant in that reply that changes the creepiness factor of a man his age dating someone in their teens  i checked twice  and nothing. you can t make this right simply by appealing to the law. putting aside the fact that what is legal you can cheat on your spouse without criminal charge  isn t necessarily moral  what is legal can even be criminal lol! it was legal to shoot mormons. it was legal to own slaves. you must do better than that. his behavior was creepy  end of story and the way he looks at the other girl is even creepier. the whole world noticed.
@miyami yuki  and the age of consent in parts of eastern europe is 14  what s your point  then we have the jealousy accusations which is typical and to be expected lol!
@vertigo  well stop acting like a salty b and we won t make them. there is no grounds for your  creepy  comment. i m just taking a leaf out of your own book  insinuations about one s character without personal knowledge of said person. so  i believe i made my point.
@miyami yuki  saying something isn t true simply cause you say so is not an argument  lol! i explained why it s creepy  i suggest you read my comments again.
it s always annoying when the actors want to play the roles. don t you know  they re supposed to hate the character and the fans. never forget though  if henry wasn t white  she wouldn t dare utter a negative thing about him.
@vertigo  my message to you is that  hate the game not the gamers ! please don t hate henry or us. god made us men and women that way  blame him if you need someone to blame. thank you.    god s probably gonna forgive you  he s like that.also thanks for the engagement and feeding the algo  you helped boosting melonie s chanel  and please don t hate her either . have a fruitful day!
@vertigo i guess your missing the fact they were both consenting adults end of story get that through your thick skull.
@daniel schim n  you are the only person  hating  here. i am well able to separate someone s politics from their character. i can appreciate that he is a geek and left witcher out of principle which i support and also acknowledge he has a creepy side. you are either creepy yourself and feel like you are defending yourself by defending him or you are just so hackish that you are all in and can t appreciate human complexity. appropriately classifying his behavior does not change anything else you may like about him. i think people these days can t think properly.
@mandalorian crusader  i think the biggest reason people often date those younger than them is more to due with a shallow feeling of not wanting an aged person than any real love although i am sure it can happen.humans are shallow beings no matter how nice we may be.
@vertigo  hoenstly dude i did sort of agree with you on a certain extent but you seem like you way too into forcing this opinion on everyone here.
@daniel schim n  god made us to want to date younger people in my christian circles it seems that we actually should learn to accept ages more since porn addicted men and heavy sex reliant ones often seem to have a root in bias of older women and seeing sex and women in an idealistic way thats not reality.of course i don t think this is saying that dating a younger woman is a sin but i don t think god intended for us to just only ever want younger people.i admit it doesn t feel good as a man to know most women my age won t like just because i am not 20 years older and suffering from arthritis lol.or same for when i may be 50 and women my age would prefer a 30 year old.then again i already have almost reserved myself that humanity sucks and will continue to suck more and no one really deserves anything specific just because they want it.and being single may save me pain anyways.
@vertigo  i feel creepy isn t the exact word right now its more like he has a preference that could be shallow since he prefers younger women rather than anyone who is actually aging.
good segment thank you.
@vertigo  funny the way you think 19 is below the age of consent for dating cavill  but i m betting you think a 19 year old woman is old enough to make decisions on abortion and gender surgery.
he wouldn t let us drastically change everything about the story and characters to push an agenda like we want him to  therefore bigot.
pretty much.
@scott doesntmatter ok i get what your saying but if you read the books they don t have a lot of action so for tv that would be difficult.
cavill can t act lol.
@dragon ball fans can t read  more than you can.
@brian thompson  that s not saying much.
@talentroller 44  the mcu currently sucks though its boring and i am so sick of extended universes the dceu is unappealing to me now because of the mcu.
@p. whitestrake  haven t marvel fans been up in arms over the latest averageness of marvel movies now
@chandller burse  i also think the mcu is boring now. its a shadow of its former self
@colin davis  the difference between comic book superheroes and fantasy literary characters is that superheroes go through changes every century  adapting to their era or beyond
where were these same people for black adams box office
more inspiring as henry than as superman. i think that says more about snyder s superman than about henry though.
@jack m  touch grass
i don t think this article attacked henry  why is everyone saying it is   i get what the video was about and i agree it is happening and it s a damn shame what hollywood is doing with the woke garbage and trying to destroy men and women to make us all the same. this article was not bad and never made henry look bad  henry called himself annoying  the show writer did too. i think all this particular article was saying was henry was super passionate and excited. that being said i have seen ppl attacking him which is insane but this article isn t a good example of him being attacked.
i just hope he doesn t get blacklisted because of these attacks. just because they are bs doesn t mean anything.
exactly. a rule of thumb that barely ever fails me  anything the woke likes or dislikes will generally be the inverse for me.
and a lot of nerds are starting and trying to. they still keep their inner urkel while being stefan.
you do realise it s an extreme minority of people that don t like him  like 99  of people are calling them out for fucking him over lmao.
a lot of nerds fail at it thats for sure though.i am an example lol.even though i never really knew much about cavil nor aspired to be him until i guess i got into the witcher 3.
wow its like woke is yas opresor. between  fear and hate ya eat good here.
...found him  really annoying  because he was unwilling to go to bed with her
@blox117 most wouldn t want to do her like gross.
henry is gina s ex where james gunn supports her cancelation.
rumour has it  gunn wb offered him another role in dc reboot. that s ridiculous   an insult to his hard work building his version of superman for almost 10 years. it s also an insult to the loyal fans who love him as superman.
gunn just wanted a younger superman  which makes sense considering you are now building up a new dc cinematic universe. i d rather see cavill come back as a different role or as an older kingdom come superman.
@shadowman  new universe tf you on about   he s keeping suicide squad characters  his wife is staying  waller is getting a show ffs.. he s just picking and choosing with identity politics and nepotism.
@shadowman  no gunn wants people who know as little as possible about the roles and have no attachment to them. there is a reason he tells his actors to not read the source material. he s a hack who thinks hes better than all the people who came before him.  with things like guardians that might work  superman not a chance.
@batofkrypton  you mean to tell me he s keeping margot robbie as harley quinn but not henry cavil as superman !
@eminaye  that s already confirmed he s doing that... that s why i ain t watching the new universe
@batofkrypton  well i knew about the henry cavil thing but it s fucked up if he s keepin margot robbie and shit...
@eminaye  i also heard  and this might not be true anymore  but i ve also heard that they re keeping amber heard as mera  and it looks like they re not going to get rid of ezra miller even after all the crap he pulled. but henry cavill  he has to go. dc films are a freaking joke.
it 100  is. he is a champion of fans that call out hollywood and him leaving the witcher was blasphemous to the woke cathedral
you stand with a bland actor
i mean  they dropped ben affleck and gal gadot as well  so your point is pretty invalid... it s almost as if you don t understand that gunn wants to go in a different direction. snyderverse is over  dude  get over it....
similar thing happened with  person of interest  dude.
@p. whitestrake  not to be mean but his version of supes was like only in three movies really.a reboot could still keep his version alive i feel and besides i am sick of the original dceu and hell i am sick of extended universes all together.
@timothy stone  if i am not wrong the reason miller is still flash in the new film is because most of his scenes were already done when that crap went down with him so at this point they can t really scrap him without having to redo the entire movie.
yea love those double standards with men and woman. annoying af. they wrote articles praising her lol. i thought the show and her portrayal was good
no matter what it is  it s always okay when we do it.  - radical left rule  1
different showrunners  simple as. it ain t a bender politics issue. it s different showrunners.
@p. kryik  showrunners aren t the ones writing the articles covering it  though.
well... they just came out bashing her now so they got around to it. just took them a little longer.
she has gotten quite a bit of negative press about it  but the showrunners didn t throw her under the bus and instead they gave her creative control. if the showrunners for witcher took the same route with cavill it would probably look the same.
oh  that is why they talk against her to be like dificult and brat  lolnow i really like her
hes literally not a normal dude lmao. the guy is a chad
@blox117  he s normal and chad
@blox117  normal chad
@blox117  chad discrimination is still discrimination
@blox117  superchad
henry can t act.
only a hissssssssrich can archive such madness
in other words  henry wouldn t smash her  she got mad
after seeing cavil in the man from uncle... yep he would make a great bond.
@icepicjoey  and he doesn t have to spend 3-6 months getting jacked for the role. just gotta be in shape. at his first sdcc he said maintaining the superhero body between roles is impractical irl.
i think idris is too old at this point  he d be great as an older agent or something like that though
idris elba got dragged through the dark tower where they basically used the woke formula and it exploded in their face.  they were the some of the first in the fan-bashing trend.  i think he learned his lesson firsthand.  he looked physically uncomfortable as roland.i wish there was a good time line where that movie didn t exist.
i d say that s because he is a big nerd in real life. he plays  or at least played  not sure about currently  wow and even built his own gaming rig awhile back. he s really into this kind of stuff which makes him an even better choice for fantasy roles and the like. seems like a genuinely good dude to me.
@vertigo  again  she was a consenting adult. your feelings on the matter don t matter  frankly. neither do your baseless speculations on him as a person. grow up  get a life  and stop trying to find reasons to  cancel  people.
@moonsideresident  really  i know when people say something you agree with  or when they become a symbol of your politics  you will do whatever you need to do to defend them but no father or sane adult would not find men in their 30s going after teenaged girls creepy. of course it is  you know it is. it doesn t mean woke hollywood isn t a problem and it doesnt mean he was wrong to leave witcher  and that they are ruining the story  dont conflate the two things. we can do better than him. cancel   you know   that term is becoming stigmatic to those accuses of wanting to cancel people lol! i mean  it has taken a life of it s own. in the past   we use to call that freedom to criticise  hell  we even have the right to reject people. when did that become a bad thing  are we now forced to like  support and give a platform to everyone by default regardless of what they do
um  wasn t tara 19 when cavill dated her  she should already be considered an adult by that age  right  i mean  legally she already was an adult.
@shinhakumen  she was 18 if memory serves me right. it is creepy for a man in his 30 s to be dating teenaged girls and if you were her father or brother you would also rightfully find it creepy. stop making disgusting excuses for celebrities because you think he agrees with your politics.
@vertigo  right. okay. 19 is still a teenager and a minor. i get where you re coming from now. just had to confirm.
@shinhakumen  sorry  i think she was 18. also  have seen the way he looks at his underage the witcher costar  guys  there is something creepy with this guy.
also  i don t actually care all that much about politics. i was just curious because you kept saying cavill dated a teenager  but as far as i know  you re already considered an adult once you reach 18 in most states. when  in your opinion  should a person be considered an adult then  are your arguments based on emotional and psychological maturity instead of age per se  again  just genuinely curious here considering couples with large age gaps aren t really all that rare. even my parents have an 8 year age gap  but it s my mom who s older.
@shinhakumen  we are dancing around the fact still lol! it is not appropriate for a man if his age to be dating a girl who just finished high school lol! please stop strawmaning me about the term  adult . you can t even drink in some places until you are 21. it was not appropriate of him simply put. my arguments are based on reality. it wasn t a balanced relationship. talk to any fathers you may know and see what they think. we need to stop defending this cause we like celebrities. they get away with too much already.
@vertigo  okay  i think i got a clearer picture of where you re coming from now. thank you for satisfying my curiosity.
@vertigo  to be fair it is odd to see men and women date really young people even if adults but he can do it if he wants its not the most horrible thing.it does imply possibly he is one of those actors like dicapio too i think who have some shallow preferences.i mean its just not uncommon today to see people so afraid of getting old they refuse to date anyone their age.
@chandller burse  i had to pinch myself! did i just encounter a reasonable person on this thread  lolit wasn t just the fact he was a teenager  while he was in his 30s  did you see the way he looks at his underage costar from the witcher  like seriously! i thought people were exaggerating or seeing something that wasn t there but no  he was looking at he in an obviously creepy way. he likes them young this one.
first!!!
still waiting for the second the man from uncle
@itachi uchiha  i think i remember liking the first one
also morally bankrupt
@geeebuttersnap  that too
another one of these woke anti male female directors
yes  i was shocked by just how bad blood origin was  on so many levels. actually couldn t finish it.
what has happened with henry is a shame. he is obviously so passionate about these characters but the studios don t care. i wasn t a big fan of man of steel  or other movies where he played superman  but he was one of the best actors to ever play the role.
he will do fine and his career will go on regardless. he is a mad warhammer 40k fan and i will love him until the end of time for that alone.
henry cavill is getting the gina carano treatment  that s for sure.
great insight. if you watch the lord of the rings extra features what made those films so spot on was that so many people involved were tolkien fans
the funny thing is that when jenna ortega did the same thing she is even defended saying she was changing the line of old dude for a teenager and with cavill he is difficult to work with at the end they are the ones making the role and they are passionate is not bad because they both love the character they are making unlike a lot of writers now who don t care about the source material and think they are better than the author
i m expecting more hit pieces to come  maybe even an allegation because that is simply what hollywood does when it can t control someone.
i would love to watch a keanu reeves   henry cavill collaboration...it doesn t even have to be a geeky franchise or an action movie... it could be a movie about 2 buddies opening a dog groom service or a remake of cooking up a storm and i would watch it
the worst thing henry cavill ever did in his life was not putting a ring on gina carano.
he respects the fandom of whatever project he s working on because he knows what it is to be in fandom. he s one of us. he s genuine  extremely handsome and very kind. henry cavill is a movie star. like tom cruise  people will see a film just because he s in it. but why  because we trust their judgment and respect their character. they ve earned it overtime.
henry cavil is awesome! i aspire to achieve his physique one day!
cavill seems like a cool dude from all accounts. the ladies  especially anna tswg  think he s a hunk and want to date him and a guy like me would like to hang out with him and talk nerd stuff and or play a game of 40k. continuing to attack him only makes him a bigger babyface
we need more projects like rogue one - productions by people that love the material
every time they say anything they think is negative about cavill  it just makes him sound even better. the guy clearly loves this stuff  he knows what he wants as an actor  and he is passionate about the roles he guns for and projects he is involved with. we also know now that he will leave a dream role if it isn t done a good service. i also haven t read him say anything that can be construed as negative about the show or anyone involved in it. based on all this he is already awesome  and sounds much more professional and actually into all this than they were.
hes a nice guy. polite and humble. whats not to like about him
hey  i ll watch what he puts out. he s great.
he s great and we need more ppl like him in these kind of adaptions.
i m excited that henry is taking charge of the 40k live action stuff. it is impossible to do a story in that world without all of the manliness. if he handles it right  the fans will rally behind him with the full force of the imperium.
they hate him because he respects the fans unlike them
so many guys love henry and think he s awesome  he really is a perfect role model. successful  genuine and he has integrity. he s like keanu reeves in that respect  just a really nice guy that we d all love to meet in a bar and be nerdy with over a few drinks.
he is awesome. i loved that he almost missed out on the superman role because he was busy playing video games when he got the call. that is totally something i would do. i have missed calls from family and called back hours later. he is super relatable  and i have not seen him once lecture us on how we should be living.
i like to believe he was mostly being himself in his superman character  besides the accent of course
can t wait for his show!!
exactly
you could spot sir ian mckellen reading the book during takes  even if they were not fans before  they really devoted themselves to the roles they were given.
it s incredibly bizarre that we live in an age of film where they try to discourage actors from knowing the material! probably because if they know it  then they know that it s being done wrong
it s crazy how sir christopher lee even talked to tolkien  he told tolkien that he would like to play gandalf in a movie if they ever made one  this happened long before the movies got made  because jrr had to have been alive for it
@lingr icen   i agree.  i almost enjoy those more than the films
sadly  i think you are right. if i ever make it as a writer  i ll send him and actors like him my scripts  books  etc and ask them to collaborate.
are you crazy !!!! it goes against anything hollywood stands for... 2 men with integrity and loved for it. it would be a trap where hollywood would only make those 2 look bad... at any cost !
talk about the anti woke power couple
i hope henry has a role for joey batey  jaskier actor  and gina in wh40k. gina would make a great sister of battle.
i don t know much about her other than she has an mma background and she played angel dust in deadpool.
@thatharvguy  who would cavill play in a potential starcraft series  tychus  artanis  zeratul  tassadar  aldaris   he s too big to play raynor  horner  or valerian and too young to play arcturus
@david franz  can t see him as tychus.

she lost her role in the mandalorian because she mocked wokies who put pronouns in their twitter bio
they would have had super babies!
they would nearly be the exact combo of nationalities that myself and all my brothers and sisters are and we re quite awesome!
@thatharvguy  ayoo  gina as a cannoness  althought i think she would make a good inquisitor too
@p. d. l  either that or their kids would grow up in their shadow like scott eastwood and other kids of actors seem to.
cavill delivers passion from source material and cruise just delivers entertainment. both are approved in my book.
the dude almost missed his superman call because he was too busy gaming. he really is one of us!
@gamermike  cruise also delivers scientology propaganda but thats not always a factor in films lol.
dude we are mere humans  to have that perfect physique and face  that is genetics. we mere mortals have a glass ceiling lol.
@light saberaddict  genetics is a myth. henry cavil is also a mere mortal and not actually superman. he didn t always look the way he is now. with intensive workout regiment and devotion and hard work  anyone can have his physique.
@andrew robb  unfortunately though  no amount of hard work or devotion can provide someone with a sense of humor it seems...
i agree  i had a teacher in high school who was a superman fan himself.
better get on that tren and hgh  cumrade lol
and it makes him stronger. brings up his stock too
i would like to date him and do nerd stuff. i like d d  video games   and syfy and fantasy. i went out and got the witcher and wheel of time books because henry loves them. lol.
rouge one was great.  best starwars movie in ages
he s a straight white male  all 3 of which woke people hate with a passion because of some misplaced anger over something henry has nothing to do with.
he s currently partnering with amazon to make a warhammer series  as a huge fan of it he ll be in control
for the greater good!!!
henry cavill is a fantastic person and a good actor in a less than ideal time for him to be acting.
when i first saw henry with the makeup wig tests and i was like  there s no way he s going to do a good geralt  now he s literally the only person who i can see playing him well  it s funny that the showrunner thinks his enthusiasm for the character was annoying when he was literally carrying the show. the writing and most of the casting is so terrible  season 2 moreso  it was only worth watching for the scenes with henry.
henry cavil is a saint! in all seriousness...henry can play just about anything and his performance is amazing. screw them...my kids hate this new crap..they ve been dumpster diving through my dvd s and watching my stuff from the 80s and 90s..
having an employee that s enthusiastic in any job should not be described as annoying. someone with passion for what they do should be rewarded  not scorned.
she doesn t have to worry about henry being  annoying  anymore. at this rate  henry being  annoying  will be the least of her concerns.
i hope when henry dropped the big bomb online about him leaving and ended it with the whole  superman stands for hope and that ll live forever  there was one exec who realized they fucked up.
i just want to see henry cavill s warhammer series or movie  whatever he wants to make
hello melonie mac  discovered your channel two weeks ago. really enjoying your commentary roast on whatever the topic is. more power to you.
i love this man  a quality person who does that job with great dedication and seriousness.
melonie mac to play lara in the next tomb raider film. start the petition!  or at least to work as an executive producer what s your british accent like
henry cavill is like the ideal nerd we should all try to be like
that hit piece they tried to do on him was hilarious. it back fired big time and made ppl like him more lol
things like this that woke hollywood is destroying brings people together. i remember getting gas and saw a guy with a superman shirt  don t even know the guy. we were talking about black adam  henry cavil  james gunn  and the future of mcu and dc. also  i was at the dentist and saw a guy wearing a super mario shirt and we started talking about the new movie  the old one  and the cartoon show back in the day.
i love henry. he s got an army behind him
you can t cancel the king of nerds lord henry cavill.
i m excited to see what he s going to do with warhammer but especially with amazon backing him.
i hope henry cavill doesn t take that villan role just to spite them
it s always nice to see you  melonie! hollywood hates masculinity unless they are giving it to a female. the poster  for guardians 3 has a  man for nebula s body  but couldn t even  be a buff man. henry cavill is what men should aspire to but hollywood thinks weak men are what we want to see and try to  keep making money. it will implode and possibly take a generation to recover from. god bless!
they were so lucky to get an actor who actually cared about the character and they just squandered it.
this is ridiculous. henry cavill seems to be a genuinely likable guy who is passionate about the roles he plays and respects the source material when working on adaptations.
it s a sadly common thing.in tech companies the people who carry the technical side are not generally liked  appreciated or popular. they are considered annoying and getting in the way.
the employer gets paid anyway  so the  work  is his hers gulag and they can be as despotic as they want.it doesn t matter if it fails  is not that they are junk and worthless creators  is that the public is toxic  thus they get paid with even more garbage to come ...
where s that petition  let s make this happen!
she s made it very clear that she does not want people fancasting her as lara croft because she isn t the right body type.
@david franz  fair enough  though she could still be involved
@david franz  that s where the fans completely disagree
it s amazon though... they re probably gonna push him out to the sidelines so they can use his name and then do some rings of power bullshit.
i wish they would make henry the 007. but they don t want to make a good selling movie. because he would crush it. he would soar to new heights in that role. him as james bond with be unstoppable  speeding to a billion dollar box office. take care melonie
love your take on these issues! thanks for sharing
i can t wait to see him in 40k adaptation ! he will be good!
that must be the world s record at the worst effective insult ever... she basically praised him and gave him a compliment at her own expense... yet she s so oblivious of it. i m baffled  i tell you  baffled...
thankfully  for henry cavill  the villain is usually the best role in a script - with the hero being the second favorite.  that s the way it was when i did off-broadway stage plays  at least.
i m on two minds now  this is a perfect opportunity to get cavill in as bond as he would be perfect for it but on the flip side of they re going to make bond woke i really don t want to see him be part of it and i m not sure he would want to be part of it.
henry s warhammer 40k project is going to be brilliant. i can t wait.
article goes against the many  many interviews of her claiming he was the perfect one for the role! it was a netflix dream deal because cavill took whatever pay and he is top billing  20  million but for much less with the show just because everyone wanted it. netflix execs are on social media and see what fandom hits the most and the deal was too good to be true.
this is just saddening for poor henry cavill.  he only left because the studio refused to make the show based on the books and decided to do their own bs. now he is getting slandered with such bs statements. i hope henry cavill gets the best out of his career.
henry cavill can be great. my wife and i really enjoyed  the cold light of day   one of his earlier films with bruce willis and sigourney weaver. with man of steel  i just felt the writers let it down  plus  growing up in the 80 s  i ve always been a big fan of  christopher reeve s superman 1  2 and even 3 to some extent  even if it came out dorky  it really sparked my imagination as a kid lol.
i ve been saying the same exact thing! and no one wants to say it. it explains why they won t hire him for all these great potential gigs. he should be up there with the likes of tom cruise and the legends of hollywood but the new generation!
henry cavill is just the best modern actor. i wish him much success with other roles projects and films. he s a brilliant and talented actor always amazing
he s literally the perfect man. i want him on my screen. i m being so robbed
also  despite the whole armie hammer thing  i really want a  the man from u.n.c.l.e.   sequel. i grew up on repeats of the original and feel that the film was badly underrated. henry was napoleon solo  he plays what he loves to the best of his abilities.
they literally have had nothing bad to say about him. being  annoying  sounds like a personal problem for the showrunner.
i think it d be cool if he did a short  fan made style superman film in the same vein as thomas jane s punisher short film the punisher  dirty laundry from 2012 and do it in a way dc warner can t sue. you can find the punisher  dirty laundry on youtube  by the way. ron perlman is also in it.
the people in  writers rooms  are just there because they collected friends in the right places. they cant compare to real authors which is why they pretend they are better and change stuff around. it seems like this time their envy of actual talent got over an talented actor as well.
henry cavill is exactly who you would want on projects like the witcher  superman  and so on.  he is someone who wants to give the fans what they want while also being okay with changes that make sense.  he s an asset and ally to have  not an enemy.  also  don t make henry cavill a bond villain  make him james bond.  sure  he s a little older now but he still looks great and can pull off a couple of films.
the issue with video game adaptations is when they do get fans opinions or have fan screenings they always listen and invite the people they know will just eat it up  i saw them invite youtubers to the private pre screening of the last of us that had only played the game for the first time like 2 years ago  they might be fans but they aren t the diehard fans that know the characters in and out for 10 years
throwing shade at the one guy that cared about the quality of the show  it s a bold plan. how s that working out
until amazon exerts  creative control .
a favorite movie of mine. henry cavill is a great actor.
@bob c  thank you my friend. i hope we have not seen the last of it.
not the witcher netflix.tolkien and by extension  peter jackson had such vast imagination and vision when it came to differing races species and cultures in a fantasy world. the elves are elevated  regal and clearly depicted as ancient beings that has transcended the trifling squabbles of lesser beings. moving and conducting themselves with such grace and elegance   you can clearly see they are of a superior civilisation. it gives the elves  every faction  a unique feel and atmosphere to them.the same unique different feel is also captured within the witcher games  the elves feel like a race elevated to that of the humans   dwarves and so on.in contrast  netflixs creations are all so generic  bland and decrepit   with absolutely no difference between humans  elves or dwarves. netflix propaganda writers just want to create a world they want to see  a decrepit   homogenous pit of gray excrement   every fantasy species race faction consist of every earthly race  white  asian black  indian   there is absolutely zero distinction to any faction or people group. it is just a cauldron of mediocre  braindead cussing people with malformed ears. the world the woke cult wants to see.regardless of henry cavill s perfect casting and his enthusiasm and love for the games and books  from the get go i knew   not the witcher   on netflix would be dead on arrival. it  was like giving a piece of priceless art to a shit fisted chimpanzee   only there to smear its feces all over the existing canvas.  i was excited for season 1 only because of cavill ..but as always in today s age of the woke feminazi cult  i immediately saw them relegate geralt   the namesake of the franchise to the background to promote the diverse females in their propaganda piece.thus i have refused to even continue entertaining the very notion of netflix s not the witcher.i really don t mind companies wanting to make money. what i do mind  and despise is when talentless   visionless dim-witted cretins  don t have the brains to create anything new in their image  so instead they take well loved  richly culturally based  european culture   stories  created by vastly superior minds and corrupt them  defile them and distort them with only one aim  promoting the propaganda of their fascist  feminist woke cult.  that i will not abide by.   the shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot make  not real things of its own. i don t think it gave life to orcs  it only ruined them and twisted them    - frodo  the return of the king. evil is sterile. it cannot create  cannot imagine or have new ideas  certainly cannot produce new forms of life  it may be able to propagate  but only in the manner of the virus or the corruption  by turning everything into more of itself. beings who have fallen under evil control  whether they are reforged into a minion or taken over by their superpowered evil side  become cruder and twisted versions of themselves. they may gain power  but they lose crucial aspects that once made them special  and will probably not behave very intelligently.  ultimately  the hope of this kind of evil is to  at best  corrupt the whole world into being just like itself  and at worst  destroy everything. the possibility of making something new and different is anathema to it. 1 corinthians 15 33 -   don t be deceived  bad company corrupts good character.isaiah 5 20 - 20 woe unto them that call evil good  and good evil  that put darkness for light  and light for darkness  that put bitter for sweet  and sweet for bitter!23 which justify the wicked for reward  and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!each year hollywood netflix amazon disney modern   entertainment   cnn bbc fox   evolves further and further into the reich ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda.it doesn t aim to entertain provide factual news  it s only aim is to emulate joseph goebbels   mastering the art of spreading the propaganda of their woke feminazi cult.
even thou im a huge cavill fan. i dont really see him as james bond. i think he is too big   muscular for it. but it  might just be me    but i love him. he is such a down to earth kind of a man and such a geek.and i love how melonie always seems to bring in lara croft   tomb raider into any thing she does. so much fun  d
what do you think is the agenda in  inside out 2   do you think they will double down on wokeness and make a trans story  or do you think they will try to start bridge the gap and explain the teenager emotions are natural and you shouldn t imediatly question your sexuality
i m tired of being the bad guy
same with jim caviesel. he refused to even kiss another cast member due to faithfulness to his wife   marriage. he s a great actor  a good masculine man and gets blackballed from movies because he s a decent human being
this is exactly why tom cruise produces his own movies. henry cavill has learned this and that is why he is producing warhammer  where he has more control.
i want to see henry cavill portray guts from berserk. he is identical to him and is a great and devoted actor.
melonie i think you might have a crush on henry cavill  he will succeed no matter what they do  people love him!
theres deffinately something wrong these days where we cant get some decent good entertainment and it needs to stop and get called out for!!! im tired and i dont care that i will say these peeps are pricks...
nerd cred i love it.
he would be absolutly perfection as james bond.
i love my boy henry cavill.  i watch everything he s in.
i wish henry cavill would stream on twitch  it would make all us nerds automatically 10  cooler.
henry cavill is not just a great actor but a great person
maybe i m being too much of a creep but i think i would actually watch a tomb raider tv show or movie that featured melonie mac. people who bring their passion for the material to the show  game  music etc. are always a treat. when people are phoning it in  said media becomes a torture session. in short  cavill for wh 40k  let s gooo! melonie for tomb raider  let s gooo 2  electric boogaloo!
keep up the amazing work you do god bless you melonie mac we need more genuine  female women in hollywood and genuine  masculine men as well. thanks for all you do melonie keep doing god s work
have any of you ever seen that episode of fairy all parents where timmy wishes the world was all the same and everybody turned into a janetless gray blob. that s the world we re heading towards a cartoon from 15 years ago predicted it
they can t find anything actually bad that he has done  so they have resorted to attacking him for being passionate and caring about his work. interesting.
lauren hissrich  lol  reminds me of when i was learning about onomastics and first found out most traditional last names originate from a person s behavior or occupation. really puts some of these people s behavior into perspective as a potential genetic predisposition.
happy thursday melonie mac!you should of watch gabriel eltaeb s livestream with jericho green and shanth because they had actor dean cain on for over 2 hrs and almost 25 mins yesterday. the dean cain who played superman.
bro be careful  anime adaptations to movies usually suck.
you don t know him though .
yep  i have often thought of that episode when thinking about the cultural marxist woke
good afternoon  melonie! you look gorgeous today hope you have a great day
if you want to write your own material  write your own tv series and movies. that s what they need to learn.
i don t think henry would be a good bond  but i think he ll be a great villian. villians are usually very interesting characters. i think henry could and should be the new action star  think similar to chris hemsworth in 12 strong or extraction. arnold and sly were the stars of the 80s and 90s  chris and henry could be the new action star of the 2020s.there were photoshops of arnold and sly from a fan that created a contra movie poster  imagine if henry and chris starred in a contra movie.
you re mostly right  and i think cavill was the perfect geralt  but hiring fans as actors producers writers or whatever have backfired plenty of times in the past
the only thing i hate about henry cavill is how well he rocks that stash!
i don t usually follow celebs on social media  but cavill gets a follow
henry s not alone...even a certain addams is getting trashed by other netflix writers for being passionate about the source material
henry is just the perfect man you ever wanted in your life  she s just salty that he s already taken.
lauren and the woke are just mad because henry cavill tried to save the witcher from failing
she s basically complaining that he wanted to be a professional who took the role and source material seriously and respectfully vs trying to make glorified self insert fan fiction
you know if they cast him as the villain they ll capitalise on him looking the part of 007 and portray him as an agent gone bad. sean bean style.
exactly  henry cavil is legit on our side.
it s not that he is too much into the role. the character is the embodiment of  toxic masculinity . and since he likes the character so much  he must like toxic masculinity. imagine the show runner being disgusted by the character  then have this guy so into it. i bet it seems annoying to a soy.
i absolutely love henry
i heard that when henry showed up for reshoots of justice league everybody just fell backwards convulsing in agony because the stash was radiating so much masculinity that the twinks thought they were being destroyed  just a rumor though.
so hissrich didn t like henry  well that s no surprise considering he was their last resort for the role! yup  the guy who was perfect for the role was their absolute last choice.
henry cavill should be james bond!!! like come wtf  he s british and fits the bond character perfectly
it s unbelievable how netflix destroyed such a great and profitable franchise like the witcher!!!and they even had the perfect actor for the role!!!
henry is only thing carrying the show  they ignore worldbulding and most stories and events from the actuall source material
everyone will love cavill even as a bond villain and it will backfire haha
yes but the bond franchise is in the hands of the woke so i won t hold my breath.
that won t happen. i fully expect the next 007 movie to feature jane bond  and to bomb at the box office.
woke hollywood hates that henry won t trash fans and really despise the fact us fans love him
i d be down for him as bond
you got to credit an actor who values the source material
he pulls it off nicely in  enola holmes  as sherlock.. he does it wonderfully  and would enjoy seeing him in a  sherlock holmes  show...  yes rdj did two awesome sherlock holmes movies   i dont see him going back to it  and cavill is perfect for this..
i remember him saying he would stay as long as they followed the books.
have you watched  tomo chan is actually a girl  it s basically a comedy semi romance anime about a tomboy girl trying to act for girly so her longtime guy friend will realize she really loves him  not just likes him. i think you should check it out
henry cavill for president.
henry cavill in a james bond villain  why not james bond  that would be so perfect.
what i find interesting is that they want to buy an ip to make into a movie or series  but they don t trust the material to garner more fans with a new medium or that the base fans aren t enough so they water it down to fit everybody which in the end goes overboard and basically none like it.
i am so tired of this uninspired recent cliche of making white guys villains or incompetent etc. it just seems like every movie that comes out follows the same algorithm today. although i have to admit  i wouldn t mind idris elba as bond  and think he would be great for the role. the one person that is even more perfect for bond is cavill. it would also bring new life to the franchise rather than a 1 and done with cavill as some villain.
shame the writers of the witcher just wanted to half ass the series and not stay true to the source material. henry made the right decision walking away even though it must have been difficult to do so. he s such a nice guy who didn t deserve to have this happen to him.
hollywood has never been less popular.
henry seems like a really good chap.
this is just why the man is being attacked by activists and hollywood because he doesn t believe in what they do and it s making them pissed off  and i love it! they need to see that  but he can t be in hollywood  no  no  no  he s bad because he s a real man who is good for just about any role almost because the man takes care of himself  real good care and it s not just him and his ability to act really good  he also goes back to research the history of something to understand what his role in a project is if it s a reboot or an adaption of a beloved property and he defends the fans unlike most of the hollywood elites do  they talk trash about the fans saying they re just bigots or racists or whatever new npc download they have uploaded into their brains next  so this is nothing really all that new anyway! but it makes hollywood cringe when actors go against the narrative and they don t like that and it s a huge no no when you say things that more conservative or right leaning that goes against the woke leftist religion  man! so it s funny because these woke activists are the same ones that are some of the feminists that write for the witcher! they want him dead  cancelled and ousted him from the woke hollywood sphere! and he s deciced to leave the show and hollywood to go work on his own project for amazon  you know  the people that have given us shows such as the rings of power and the wheel of time  both of these shows are garbage that ruin the legacy of thew ips they re adapting   but the do have some good shows in their name too  but it s kinda hard to expect it to not be woke if they are behind it after that  it s an adaption of the iconic rpg table top adventure series warhammer 40k  and it s going to be a series of three shows that amazon has acquired the rights to do from the original owners of the game games studio and they re going to be co-producing the potential upcoming project with amazon and henry cavill will executive producing and will be having full creative control over everything and it s going to be exciting to see how it turns out as he plans to tell multiple stories in this world and turning the tv franchise into an interconnected universe! which is incredible and he will be respecting the lore and legacy of the story and the characters and is not putting any of his own personal politics where they don t belong at all! so i just can t wait  dude!
someone that s passionate about the source material is something you d want from an actor. you certainly wouldn t be calling them annoying if you were doing your job properly. i doubt that andrzej sapkowski would want netflix to make any more adaptations of his books after season 3 is done. i do think henry would make a good bond villain but i d rather him be 007. where the franchise goes next is beyond me. i mean  them killing james bond was the dumbest route they could ve went with.
dude built a pc himself made respect
i appreciate this video melonie but i would love to hear what anna thatstarwarsgirl has to say
cavill was born too late to see his career truly take off. sure he s been superman but i fear that s all we ll ever really know him as in this woke era.
god forbid if somebody shows passion for something they love.
i just can t wait for his warhammer series now.
he s british he can t run for president.prime minister i guess.
@lingr icen  i m gonna go ahead and say hubris  they think they are better writers producers  especially hilarious when you think of the works of rober jordan or j.r.r tolkien being desecrated.
idris alba or denzel should play legendary old west us marshall bass reeves in that upcoming mini series
it s not as if he is some oscar calibur actor. he has no range. wooden.
lauren finds henry annoying yet fails to realise that he is the reason her show did well
people watched to see henry cavill in the franchise they love and she and many of that team hated that.
do you have a video tour of your room collectables  they look great
yeah if i was the writer of a novel and someone wanted to make a movie out of it i would just turn them down because i don t want to see my series being change for someone else to fit their vision. that s just sick most of the time.
i read  some henry cavill forums  and its truth there is woke movement lead by young women that really really hate him as a personal thing. its really insane.
you are right about how they don t want us to be who we are. hc is the only witcher worth watching in my opinion.
guy who plays jon snows brother looks pretty good as james bond type in amazon s citadel.
hi melonie big fan thoughts on red dead redemption 2 it  has a great story and great gameplay which modern games can t mix well and micah was a great villan to hate thoughts
henry cavill is so likeable.
henry has to be bond  not the villain. that guy is grounded like the earth s core.
what made the mcu successful was that the ppl behind the scenes were fans.
have an excellent monday  melonie!
interesting note about james bond  they are trying to change ian fleming s words to be more digestible for those of more sensitive pallets. kind of like they did to charlie and the chocolate factory. whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
elliott page is too  cute  for james bond  a kid type of cute  for me
i ve been calling for cavill to play bond for the last 10 years. the fact that he wouldn t be the next one is a joke.
9 17 actually  i want to see somebody like super different as james bond like a nobody. cavil would be a sick reoccurring villain
he dare cavill try to respect the source material.
melonie mac strong opinions
hes not a faux nerd like they all are.
hollywood disrespecting their source material is almost a tradition. historically  this has been true even of conventional novels to a fairly large extent  but is especially true of science fiction  comic books  and video games  which hollywood executives have zero respect for. the first two sam raimi spider-man movies were an odd exception because raimi was a big fan. of course  the higher-ups had to stick their finger in for the third film and mess it up. then we got a comic book company actually making movies with marvel studios  and we saw some more great results. of course  they had to get bought up by more traditional hollywood types who ended up gradually messing up the whole thing.it s funny that hollywood usually starts out with people who are not fans of the source material  but then afterwards sometimes makes the mistake of listening a little bit too much to the vocal masses who have no idea how to make a movie and trying to hurry things along or forcing something that doesn t work on screen. writers  directors  actors  and producers that are fans of the source material are the ideal people to make a movie  but you can t convince executives of this.then of course when hollywood gets political  they usually royally screw up everything. this is more true right now than ever before.

hey  melonie i have to say that henry cavill was a great superman in newer dc movies and i hate to see him go but i wish him luck with his future movie career. anyway if hollywood wants to continue to attack henry cavill so much then beat it. i think that he would be a great james bond character for upcoming james bond movies and he would be a great character in other movies that he wants to be in and play in upcoming future. anyway i don t care what hollywood thinks about henry cavill that i think he is a great actor and he does a great job with playing different characters roles in different movies that he is in. anyway i just wanted to make a comment about this video for today and i just wanted to say that henry cavill is a great actor and does a great job of playing a great role in different movies  ok melonie. anyway hope you are having a great day today and hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also i will not be able to join y all tonight for prayer meeting on discord bc i have to go babysit my niece  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to let you and everyone know that and i would appreciate if you and everyone else could pray for my uncle bc he has cancer inside of his mouth and he has lost alot of weight and so i would appreciate it if you and everyone could please pray for my uncle this evening  ok melonie. anyway my uncle name is gary mcclanahan  ok melonie. anyway thanks and have a great day and evening at home and have fun with prayer meeting melonie.
from hero to villain. that s really sad
i m telling you timothy chalamet will be the next superman the way things are looking.
criticizing someone because they love what they do too much... that s where we are  of course considering all the rewrits making no sens in the show cavill surely wanted to minimize the bullshit they were making. they want to hire people who doesn t care what they do  they only look for the money so easy to making them do what the studio wants  unfortunately for the studio cavill wans not this type at all
in regards to henry cavill being a bond villain  i actually want the next bond film to feature both henry cavill and michael fassbender as james bond  one is the real deal  the other is an imposter assassinating people using his identity and mi6 are after both men. the result is the imposter believes he is james bond because he was brainwashed  bond reminds him of who he is helps him switch and aid bond against the true villains. who plays the real bond and who plays the imposter  it can go either way. what do you all think
not to forget that with the witcher he was lured in with promises of how the material would be handled.  they lied.
so we can expect the villain to overshadow the  hero  in the next james bond film.
peter jackson  surrounded himself with the biggest fans he could find to ensure peak accuracy to the source materiallauren hissrich  tsk  someone actually cares about this role  who stressful.
i agree with some of ur points but 2 25 its cuz james gunn is rebooting the franchise
hollywood is a tiny angry bubble  cavill is loved by the audience which is vast
can t wait for the new war hammer show to come out
elliot page as a bond villain  yes
get henry to be the next bond but let james gunn write and direct it. that would smack hollywood in the face.
henry cavill is awesome!!!
if wb didn t prioritize their greed  we should have a henry cavill superman trilogy by now  imagine the years they wasted him from jl 2017  to black adam cameo 2022   those gap already worth of 2 superman films.
henry cavill is my man  i won t watch any of his roles portrayed by someone else  period.
how about henry cavill as the next johnny cage
he s not getting into trouble because of  woke  anything  he badmouthed the production he was part of  the same thing happened to katherine heigl.
he ll be the villain in the next 007 jane bond film... lol
he s tall  good-looking  masculine  charismatic  charming  and a bit of a dork  he s a threat.
they will never make him james bond. the way things are going i expect the next 007 movie to be jane bond.
i ve never  ever  publicly denigrated one of my former employees. such a classless thing to do.
okay  that s it  i m subscribed! two video hits for me
zendaya should definitely be the next bond!
funny fact henry cavill is more james bond than james bond.producers  he wont play james bond. the world is just insane. nothing surprise me anymore.
i can just imagine a giant round table in a room somewhere in hollywood full of ghouls and  goblins picking and choosing what americans should like to view in movies.
an idris elba 007 would be cool as long as they don t call him james bond. i would totally watch a 00 movie with elba as the hero and cavill as the villain
it hurts when someone says no to be f   ed senseless
more fans  fewer activists. might be a winning formula with fans. y know genuine fans who pay real money for stuff they care about. insane idea.
i want him to play chris redfield in a resident evil movie.
i am so interested what will happen when the next season comes out after the blood origin flop. it s constantly pushed fun every list on netflix to me  but i refuse to watch it.
henry cavil is a stand up guy. the fact that hes not doing a season 4 of the witcher because he cannot play geralt in a series that does not respect the source material of the books and games is  showing character and real love of the story and the character he plays. since that is descent i am not suprised woke is against him. they probably want a witcher that will ask jennifer for a potion to grow breast and instead of slaying monster asking them how they should be pronounced or what their gender identification is
hollywood s attack on henry is because of his former relationship with gina carano.
imagine being annoyong from working with someone who wants to do their job.
somebody needs to get clue and run hissrich out of that industry.
lmfao the worst they got is he was enthusiastic to play a character he loves  the pettiness of the left is limitless lmao. imagine writing this article and not ending with  april fool s!
i bet they making the next bond a woc if they make him the villan
they trying to kill masculinity but henry cavil sir much respect man
i think  henrycavillis too big for  jamesbond  but if he would be willing to lose some mass  he would be good  but i would prefer him continuing  manfromuncle or start up a live action  actionman movie franchise  he would be perfect for that  richardmadden could be good for both as well
henry is one of us and they don t like that.
when i searched news about the witcher and henry cavill last summer  i found your channel. thanks henry! did not disappoint!
there two candidate tom cruise or henry cavill..tom cruise a buff person as chris is awesome it s fit the actor and also strongly resemblance as chris.henry cavill he is already buff and already big he can do it enough if that director and the films creator hired him as chris redfield.
he wanted to respect the source material and the fans. what a horrible man.
well  at least there s warhammer. and it sounds like he s got some control with that.
henry is one of us   hollywood.
good grief i wish henry was in charge of the witcher the show would b so awesome
with all due respect  my dear lady. it makes zero difference to the average of people worldwide what hollywood thinks  speaks or does. let them rot and fall into oblivion. nice video  btw.
i don t even mind if they reinterpret the source material but you better know what you are doing and ideally the characters should still be recognizable as the ones from the source material.  look at a show like resident evil on netflix for instance.  that show isn t even recognizable as resident evil anymore.
henry cavil doesn t get the respect he deserves
it s funny that us  nerds  are called too masculine now when 20 years ago we where called weak and not manly enough lol
barbara broccoli and michael wilson will stay true to the character of james bond. they ve always stuck close to the books.
10 03 james bond can be anybody though
henry played the game  that is why he was such a great geralt. i am pretty sure that liam hensworth has no idea how to play the game or really anything about it all. not to mention that henry was the perfect superman. i haven t been to the movies in over 5 years. i hate the way hollywood has remade and recast characters for their agenda. i hate to say it  i am 60 and the best actors are just about gone and what few good ones like henry that are left  they are pushing out.
man fdb if the show runner says he was too enthusiastic for the roll. like really  he likes making something good and relatively accurate to what made the original characters likable  no wayyyyyyy
i heard catherine zeta jones said she was born to play james bond.
hissrich is a professional writer all these so called  fans  can t expect every professional writer to be good at writing it s downright abusive and i m sure she puts a small amount of effort into these scripts.
they keep making trash we hit them where it hurts. in the pockets.
once again  hollywood shoots themselves in the foot.  has alec baldwin been giving them lessons
idris alba would be a great james bond
they re just fuming because they got the hots for him and he couldn t care less.
i wonder why we all don t just fund individual directors who will go against woke hollywood  then we can have the films we want without the bs. i would pay a lot for that
these streaming services need to wake up to how this is hurting their brand. when they pay their bills they don t see the witcher. they see netflix.
oddly enough i was just reading an article yesterday about a minority that wanted to play the heel and they wouldn t let him because they prefer white men to be heels. the minority wanted to be the bad guy cause sometimes it s a better role and it s more fun. not gonna happen for him in hollywood.
i don t see anything bad about the villain role in james bond  bond villains are more iconic than bond himself.
wow. how dare an actor have passion about the character he is playing
there is a whole catalog of great movies from the 80s  90s and earlly 2000s. even the bad movies are looking alot better compared to all the modern woke trash. robocop 3 wasnt as bad now
do a leave henry alone!!!!! parody video!
henry really should ve realized that netflix would woke the crap out of the witcher.
interview with lauren hissrich.  we would like you to write the script for the witcher .  lauren hissrich  what s the witcher .  oh! never mind  i ll just make it up as i go along .
henry cavill
i wouldn t have used the last of us as an example i loved the 1st and the show is just like the game but with small changes
i love henry
they could hire idris elba as a new 007 and name it marcus luther  and continue the franchise since james bond died. just my 5cents
i hope all those folks employed by netflix s witcher series thank lauren on their way out the door for completely and thoroughly destroying a financially viable ip. well done lauren. girl power!
so actors can t be excited about roles they are playing  got it hollywood.
do these people working on this show not realize that their viewership is going to drop off a cliff. season 3 isn t even out yet and it s going to drop even though cavil is in it. i mean seriously why do these people not want to make a good show or movie  don t they get tired of blaming racism sexism and homophobia on their failures  and how long do their bosses plan on taking those excuses
ive read abit how he can be a real hassle to work with.
careful  melonie  you may be the target of anna s wrath as she s already laid claim to him.
even if cavill is the next bond villain  do not pay to see it. no one should.
cavill bond  elba bond villian. take my money.
so just because he has great love and passion for the character  makes him  annoying    seriously.
henry cavil or scott adkins for commander shepard in me.
no robocop 3 is stillbad lol don t start that crap please
i would definitely pay good money to see that it would be epic.
i m to old for heros. i respect henry cavill and his dedication to his craft.hollywood  and it s ilk. not so much.
oh  big surprise from the lefties   their thinking and strategy is completely backwards.a few years ago i was not the biggest henry cavill fan. i thought you was okay in the mission impossible movie  but nothing special. i was far from excited when i saw him as superman  and i m not a huge witcher fan.here s the thing though  the more these people come after him for no reason  the more it makes me like him. the more they try to make us hate him  the more i will support him.it seems they are losing their touch for cancel culture.the same goes for guys like chris pratt  and zachary levi.because the sjw mob wants them canceled i would vote for them to get every role available.
yes  herry cavill would be perfect for  bond  james bond . i can see it now.. hollywood just need to get their heads in the game. it s the only logical conclusion...
the current frontrunner is aaron taylor-johnson of kraven  and the mcu  quicksilver   for the next bond. i d prefer henry  or even idris  but it depends on the brocolis  the current reps have said that bond is male  so it won t be a woman next.
that woman sounds like she s still in middle school  spreading rumors about a guy who wouldn t go out with her...
tell me you suck at running shoes without telling me you suck at running shoes. he likes being the witcher from the lore too much. we need to change the witcher for .reasons.
cavill is the perfect man. i m saying that as a straight guy.
they want future people..south park as always has warned us about it a long time ago!
congrats melonie.we don t see often opinions like yours especially from girls.keep it up!
love this lady. lol
clearly the showrunner hates the fans and the source material just like gunn who doesn t care about the fans and it shows.
i love henry cavill so much. i hate to see that they are trying to destroy his career for simply being a straight white male who is masculine.
geez. if they won t let henry play james bond  then make the sequel to the man from u.n.c.l.e.  and not replace henry in that movie  lol .
i know that the woke nuthouse is running amok  but the other side is not doing a much better job either.what in this video screams hollywood attack on henry cavill  it s an article about him being so eager to play the role of  geralt that he pestered  not my words  it s in the article  his agents to get a meeting with the program creator while the show was still in early development.there is nothing there that screams attack on cavill and much less on his  masculinity .melonie  you need to know what battles to pick  you just can t go around arguing about everything and anything because that will put at the same level as the woke nutjobs.personally i can t stand deification  whoever it is  and henry cavill now it s the new be all end all in cinema.henry cavill is an actor like any other  he is not god s gift to nerds.
this is the same lauren that almost did a talk with thequartering then backed out because of the twitter dumb machine talked her out of it. knew this show was gonna suck lol.
if henry cavill didn t get the role a geralt in the witcher. the first season would have been like blood origin. lauren schmidt hissrich would have butchered the series. he kept them honest to the fans.
since woke trash does not like henry then he has to be a good man.
so  can we say mr.cavill is the next bashing target on hollywood s list  right after chris pratt  i m seeing a trend  which is not surprising at all
it s really sad to watch cavill s mistreatment and underutilization. i can t begin to imagine how frustrating it must be for him have a front row seat watching the destruction of the things he s passionate about. i m hoping when the following witcher seasons flop it sends a message to netflix. they re skating on thin ice after the garbage that was blood origin.
10 09 isn t  james  bond a poc woman now
hollywood wasted henry cavill. he could have been the uber-chris pratt.and honestly  even aside from being a nerd - harry has to care about his portrayals because it literally affects his career. if they are having him do something stupid  he would be totally justified in bucking against it. and since henry was a witcher fan  he was in the know about what fans would find  stupid .
i have the next  james bond  script. here is the lowdown the next 007 will be jane bondage  kink-positive . the actor will be will be 600lbs  black  assigned female at birth  non-binary  with blue dreads. she will also be a quadriplegic and a  minor-attracted person .henry cavill will play the role of patrick riarchy  sending her anonymous bigoted tweets while he sits in his fancy office  being misogynistic to his secretary and forcing his wife to be a stay-at-home mom. jane bondage will team up with antifa to dox pat riarchy and send him for lgbt  education.the film ends with henry cavill in drag reading to kindergarteners with a chinese flag in the background.
henry cavil leaves the witcher to focus on superman  gets fired as superman  the left bully him. this man s gone though enough in a few months let him be
henry cavil was not right for the role from the very start  he was far too muscular for geralt..... geralts strength stems from mutations and not muscle bulk... however geralt should have been the director of the series  it would have made it more watchable
lol   it s annoying apparently to want to give fans what they want as a fan himself  ok then this is y i respect henry cavill
henry cahill is a gentleman and awesome.  i loved him in superman  the witcher  and elona. . . i don t agree with the writers of the witcher - they shouldn t have taken a job for material they hated!!!  the writers suck!!
aww  poor lauren is insecure and feels threatened by a talented man.  we all need to do worse so that she can do better by comparison.
you would be an amazing lara croft!
3 09 this kind of reminds me of this video https   youtube.com shorts sovi54flshy feature sharei d say women like the witcher showrunner who hate seeing men be happy and successful in their endeavors. yeah  it s a standup routine  yet that kind of envy and resentment does exist.
for the emperor!
if it s for the fans   the perservation of the original lore  he deserved to be annoying.
we need an orville version of the witcher.  a knock-off version  which is close to the original  unlike the fake  real  version we re currently getting.
richard madden should be bond imo.
both racism and bigotry are bad no matter your skin colour or personal beliefs. it s amazing how these woke people are both these they claim to be against  -
it be cool  if he can be super man 1 more time  .
i have zero hype for any and all adaptations because i know the people are just trying to flip the ips like houses and get that nerd demographic money and these business grads making shows and movies have actual disdain for the people they want to milk. especially if it s a man which cavill very much is. fans are dollar signs to these hedge fund managers.
i personally don t think that henry cavill wants to play this bond. not after his experience on the witcher  and casting him as the villain is too similar to his role in mission impossible that it d force comparisons and i don t think that s good for the next bond movie.
hehe every girl drools over henry he s a pretty cool dude haha.
well it would be an interesting story line for james bond s daughter to take up the mantle of 007.
4 40 like they did with the halo show
i have been championing for cavill to be bond for years. if its true  they want him to be the bond villain. i hope he tells mgm to go f  k. he needs to be bond. a connery style of bond with a cool early craig style. but unfortunately  we will have a woke feminist bond. soo cavill will be best to steer clear  or he will have another witcher situation.
it s okay to portray all the villains as strong white men  just as long as we make it clear that they re bad and you should be rooting against them.
i don t get it the fans love the guy  who are these people that hate him. name and shame them.
what a mess. i was so utterly devo when henry got replaced with that really awful hemswoth guy in witcher  idk what it is about henry he is just so dreamy  i would pick him to live on a deserted island with!! lol all mine!!
henry cavill as chris redfield. thoughts
i no longer watch remakes  reboots  sequels or spinoffs that race or gender swap or force diversity at the expense of the original ip.  it completely destroys any entertainment value in my opinion.  as a result  i now have a lot more free time to spend on healthier pursuits.
love the guy  but would he be a good bond villain   most bond villains  it s about their intellect  not their physical prowess.
funny  i saw that same article in my feed earlier today.
idris is too old for the role  and for a set of films. cavill is also aging out  unfortunately. aaron taylor-johnson is an interesting   good match up with the opening for the role... did an impressive   charismatic bit of acting in bullet train recently
should be next 007
grace randolph keeps implying henry is in tbe closet. she also keeps implying gina carano is an anti-semite  so i would put much stock in her opinions.
i am very straight  but i have to admit  henry cavill possibly makes me feel a little bit gay.    surely that is a win for promoting a better lgbt  acceptance.         the problem with woke culture is that their broad goals in general are admirable  but nearly every single element about how they go about acheiving their goals is problematic.     it is truly a case of  good intentions paving the road to hell
i am french speaking  i love her accent  what part of the usa is she from
cavill looks nothing like geralt in the books. yeah  cavill is the ideal masculine  respectable  and based man who understands what it means to be a passionate fan of something  but he s not geralt of rivia. the best one say about him is  as far as the video games goes  he nails the voice but it s not the voice or geralt as written in the books. that s not an  opinion   but fact.read the description of geralt  from his not-so  appealing  appearance and voice  to just everything about him that was completely absent from the show and games  then you ll understand.
is that a tattoo from weedcraft  good game. good vid.
you know the whole witcher series was doomed to fail with a dogshit showrunner that calls the main act  over-enthusiastic  to deliver on his role. so telling of nowadays tv movie adaptations.
we need someone like elon musk .or someone with billions to buy up land in texas or florida ..and make a new conservative studio .without that there will be no counter to their indoctrination u need about 10000-50000 acres maybe buy a huge ranch then u need to produce good felix and shows and fund them conservative billionaires need to do this. it s essential to saving this country
people are getting tired of this  just see how blood origins bombed hard.top gun maverick and yellowstone success already sent a messagethe weird think is netflix not canceling it  since they already cancelled stuff for much less  maybe they already invested to much to cancel.
feels like the showrunners hate the idea of a masculine heterosexual white male being such a popular icon in modern fiction and have an agenda to deconstruct the witcher mythos simply to snub   spite the fans  who they probably view as toxic. seems the success of a show is secondary to scoring woke brownie points for many in the industry today.
is  annoying  new word for   true to source material
zero faith that the next bond will be any good. wouldn t be surprised if global warming and toxic masculinity team up as the big bads
if he plays a villain in a bond movie i d be surprised if they don t cast a woman to play new james bond  now jamie bond - first international transgender spy - to defeat his masculine white male villainy.
i only watch movies from the 1900s to the 2010s
the only way  now is to stick around with non-woke actors and produce a badass shows and movies like the one with top gun maverick. why not sign up with paramount pictures
they hate masculine men  they hate nerdy passionate men   they hate the source material  but they love love love the brand recognition  and they love the nerd money money money.   but aww  they get mad when the nerds wise up and stay away  funny how that always happens .
i don t care what anyone says   idris elba would be a sean connery level james bond
seems like you misunderstood the article. the article clearly meant that she found his persistence annoying not because he cared about the role or the game or that he was white. and it was his persistence that got him the role. as a believer in christ  don t you think it is wrong to be quick to be jumping to controversy or making such a leap in conclusions from an article that didnt say any of the things you were saying  you re not concerned that you re accusing someone of something they didn t do  some of your commenters are now calling hissrich a witch
great melonie mac go boom henry can t a break
the problem is  henry cavill is very stubborn... he wants what he signs on for done a certain way because he is passionate. this has led to him being called difficult to work with. the biggest issue is he apparently doesn t back down which can affect the morale of the production. i do understand his side of things... but i also understand the other side. sometimes you have to let the creative minds do their thing.   shrugs   its a difficult situation. however i don t like them causing an uproar and making this public. makes no sense right now.
journalists keep trying to sink in this dude  it ain t working
i sure hope these hollywood execs apply the same logic to all their dealings. hiring people who despise home-owners as their architects  those who hate plumbing to take care of their pipes etc.
as fare as i know california has created a law that forces hollywood to hire deversity actors to get financing for movies.
10 26 let s get a hot ginger dude redheads need representation too
james bond. scott adkins
melonie mac go boom your a good woman
lauren hissrich should have been on her knees begging cavill to accept the role of geralt  henrycavillissuperman  makemos2withcavill
for me and countless others  hollywood and disney are dead.there s no coming back from this. i d rather give my time and money to independent companies and actors who don t fit with their beliefs and  vision .all that wasted money  time  and labor isn t a good thing.
10 30 who likes new james bond films   i think nobody.
it sounds like hollywood should fire that writer.
that s pathetic to call someone annoying for being really hype to play a role.
paramount pictures also have woke producer. although they re the least woke from big 5 company1  disney   99  movies and shows since 2017 is woke2  sony   80  movies and shows since 2016 is woke3  wb   60  movies and shows since 2018 is woke4  universal   30  movies and shows since 2020 is woke5  paramount   20  movies shows since 2019 is woke
the amorphous blob is the death of the individual.
yeah  dev  but where is your lambo tho in all seriousness  great uptate!
i don t understand them at all  if they want to write their own characters why not just make a new ip!!!!
i get the point but this article is not a good example  she was saying he was annoying  henry even called himself annoying  lol like he was super super passionate and knew he was being annoying and going full blast for the role before it was time to cast an actor....i totally agree with what melanie is saying but i find nothing wrong with this article and no where in the article did anyone say henry cavil was bad and was the word annoying being used in a negative way.....i feel like this is out of context and being twisted a little. however  i do agree this happens i am totally against woke hollywood bs and all that but this article doesn t apply to that.
masculinity is done
hollywood has been making sh!t for about ten years now except for a few movies that didn t want to buy into the virtue signaling.
i think that s the reason why james gunn passed on henry cavill to reprise his role as superman. he s woke just like most of hollywood!
great reporting and video also you look gorgeous btw
nerds love him  checkmen consider him a really good actor checkhetro women consider him talented and eye candy checkpretty much all people  henry cavill has integrity checkhollywood  we can t fucking have anything to do with him !!!!!!!
such a shame
thanks!
if you re annoyed by an actor being excited about a role  you don t belong in the industry. also  elliot page as james bond  henry cavil won t save that thing from bombing.
yo  that a bs article. i remember this interview from way back in 2019 when they were both promoting s1 of the witcher and both were laughing and joking at henry s persistence at some comic con panel. this fandomwire site is just trying to stir bs and ride on henry clicks.
so the villain in the next james bond movie will be a better james bond than james bond  whats next it ll turn out he s james bands evil twin separated at birth...he playeda good bad guy in mi.just give the man the roles weall want him to be in ffs.
between idris elba and henry cavill playing bond...i ll flip a coin and be super elated either way.  they both deserve it.bond is a man  a charismatic spy  a womanizer  and threat to every government on earth.  he is the epitome of what a man is capable of being  athletic  intelligent  suave  and clever above all else in any situation.i don t think ian fleming thought bond should only be white... only british  because fleming was a patriot in that sense.ffs  the man drank gordon s gin like it was going out of style.
i find her annoying. i m sure a lot of people feel the same way and won t be watching seasons 3 and 4. good luck to her. she is gonna need it when the show she is working on tanks.
some girls now days  don t want men to have fuuuunnn
100
was this meant to save her reputation  couldn t she just say we had a difference of opinion and move on  what is the need to go out of your way to make him look bad. i don t think this will help your cause.
@brenda spence  black adam was doa. although the rock did love the fans however.
thank you so much
idris elba is too old  he will hit 55 while cavill is 40
a man born in the wrong era  its sad.
can we ship melonie and henry now
alex kurtzman claimed to be a huge fan of star trek  but yet he came in and trashed the franchise.
she was annoyed by an actor who was enthusiastic to do his job well       lauren hissrich is everything wrong with modern hollywood.
elliot page will be the next james bond. jhahahha!
woke are despicable people .fans love henry no matter what !
by who s definition  2 39
calm down lauren. he isn t going to sleep with you.
i know melonie is libertarian with out her tell me
are we sure the article title isn t satire and click bait
i really hope the show runner is humilated by lack of views for season 3. i didnt mind the first season but seaon 2 was kinda blah
the next james bond will be some androgynous fairy boy... i m thinking timothee chalamet
they re gonna change it to jane bond who will be a woman of color. i used very little thought process for that so i m 100  sure i m right.
when will they do a lgbqt  non-white  or female villains  some of these roles can instantly allow someone to claim to be the first at.
over enthusiasm
never played the games or read thebooks  but i sure like the witcher character cavill played. but the story line ...  yeahhh  no intrest to see more after annoing season two  no matter who is acting the lead character.only way netflix is going to get my money on future is to realese good series   like season 1 from wicher  and movies on fysical media
the shame of it is  it s making me not care. which in a way is what it should be. because why does it matter if there s race gender swapping if the film series is still good. but to force changes like that for the sake of it and ruin beloved stories and franchises to fit a current narrative is just stupid.
hey melonie  do you know that they have cut verses from the bible
i think someone else should play the witcher tbh i think the show could ve been better to tbh.
hissrich  more like herrich.gottem
just a reminder to drink water.
henry shouldnt be a james bond villain.... he should be bond himself
cavill was the only good thing about the witcher show. it s going to see a major drop in ratings when he leaves.
0 20 you forgot to mention womanizer and cheater  but hey whatever lol.
hollywood is full of activists . they don t care if there movie does terrible.  it s all apart of the message. my best advice stick to classics or watch foreign.
say whatever she wants  there s no excuse in hell going to cover her shitty writings.he tries to get his agent to arrange a meeting with lauren  the amount of passion he has for the lore...not only his is hot  but a nerd as well  geez
pretty tired of woke hollywood acting a fool and trying to shove failed ideas down people s throats. is there a studio out there doing it right  maybe all the actors with like minds can gather there and show the examples of what people wants
hi  mel.
no race swaps!!!!! make a new character.
i m tired of the racism and misandry coming out of hollywood. this is why i haven t seen a new movie in over a year. i m done.
toss a coin  for your witcher  . oh valley of evil wokie
streisand effect anyone
let me guess cavill the villain  the guy playing dr who as bond. stunning and brave. men acting like women  good  men acting masculine  bad.
back when they said she was the one running the show i was dreading it. seems i was entirely right. she s a typical agenda-driven junk writer and producer.
lol.  woke
i like pumpkins.
i like henry cavill but if the next james bond movie turns out to be a woke movie  i won t watch the movie. even if henry is in it as a villain.
they are trying to transfer classic masculinity to lesbians and classic feminity to transgenders and open sexuality to children.
love you
what s with these writers who are working on something they don t even like or respect. why the fuck they even writing for it if they ain t interested in the source material.
there are like 13 dr whos brother
if you meant matt smith  you must be kidding me. hands down good and masculine actor.
they destroyed the witcher and destroyed superman  eff hollywood
the rock didn t do it for henry  the rock wanted to use his fame to sell tickets to his shit movie. the only good thing to come from this is not having to suffer anymore rock movies lmao
might see a trans man for bond  that wouldn t surprise me.
witcher s3 is doa
ok this is weired i just subscribed but i cant activate the notification bell i click it and it goes back to no notification... did you pissed off utube
i sad something like 2 years ago  soon we will get woke james bond. maybe we have to suffer through woke james bond soon.bond in the 70s wasn t extremly masculine. he was a gentleman. not the hulk thay had later. they should and could go back to gentleman bond. but i know  they hate it aswell. being positive masculine. cold and self-confident. knowing  what to do  and how to do it. willing to do  what is necessary. willing to sacrifice. willing to be cruel and efficient  if you have to. strong  cold  smart. but still kind  a gentleman. a protector. maybe they hate it more than the aggressive muscle type man  because james bond is able to do far more. strong  clever  sneaky  and very fascinating. he don t have to be violent. he could. but it s not necessary  because he has his charm.so  i can imagine  they hate old bond even more than new  drunk bond  and soon we get woke bond. maybe gay. tgat would be so stunning  so brave  edit  bond-boy instead of bond-girl. maybe henry cavill
naw. she called my boy cavill annoying  she s wack!
henry should be bond not the villain
elba is a good actor but he has almost made a career from taking race swapped roles.  his actions don t quite line up with his statements.
does anyone else wish that they could make melonie mac go boom
cast cavil as a bond villain  cast 5 1  non-binary  bipoc 007. then have that 5  actress slap cavil around. expectations subverted
i kind of wish all of california would just sink into the pacific ocean...
hey hollywood  keep going. i m saving a ton of money  not going to pay to watch your crap then be craped on
cancelled why  and for what. best superman since reeve. fire james gunn and hire cavill.
gosh darnit! why must the lead actor actually enjoy his role! whatta misogynist
eh  i don t see him as james bond at all.
so annoying when people care.
are you ok   your energy seems off
this doesnt bode well for the witcher series. with the  annoying  cavil gone they will definitely ruin the series.
you know  new producer since tomorrow never die is feminist  she s daughter of the previous producer. she got a job through her father.
@bobo boy  yeah probably we have to wait a few decade before we can got a decent james bond film. cavill born in the wrong decade..
is it acceptable to refer to people with tattoos as  colored  people
nintendo
upset over superman is ridiculous what is that mean for  ask western boys.. the western almost gotten so far with this.. the whole movie the whole actress western are the problem.
some who is genuine  that doesn t fit the narrative  we get it...everything is shite  how do we rectify our situation  complaining about it gets you nowhere
america is a mess. i looked up to americans when i was younger and always wanted to live there but now i just see it as a giant circus and am glad i don t live there. it just sucks most entertainment comes from there otherwise i d avoid it all together.
love him. hate his taste in women.. she is a little trollop of a thing.
do you delete my comments or does yt
the second season of the witcher was such garbage i couldn t finish it
sure.
james bond is dead
bond will be a black woman or a trans female. should be fun.
algorithm comment

now the show sucks  and this hollyweirdo is stuck with a netflix show that nobody is watching and will be cancelled. kind of funny.
you aren t of looking
henry was a boring actor. c mon let s not look at the henry cavill years through rose colored glasses. lol
cavill tend to search someone who are nerd like him
great actor and hollywood gets to check a box.
too old and well known for that too happen. besides bond is an actual set character based off of a real life person. if they alter the character in any way it s no longer bond  just a woke spy film with the 007 attached to it.
