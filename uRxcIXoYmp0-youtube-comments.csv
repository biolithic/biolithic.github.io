dylan is a performer and a character actor. he was discovered  recruited  and groomed to play the role he is now playing. he s being controlled and is part of the terrible social engineering that is underway in western society. he is not being victimized. he has freely agreed to do this and is well paid for his participation.
dylan mulvaney is proof that this is still a man s world
i agree with you and have said this myself. he was definately planted on us out of nowhere. he went from being on price is right to where we are now. it s no coincidence.
hint  when a corporation gives someone an advertising deal that the company knows will hurt their bottom line  it s obviously a psychological operation. nike and budweiser have access to the most sophisticated customer data in the history of business. both companies knew exactly what the response would be to this bit of dylan advertising theater. the thing to be careful of is falling into whatever trap is being set with this dylan character... because there is a trap being set.
have to give him credit   he went from a strange and weird nobody to a rich and famous psycho   only cost him his pride and soul  small price for people like him!
exactly. they just needed someone guidable and desperate enough for attention. dylan is definitely a plant and the perfect specimen. thank you for confirming my thoughts. even trans people call him out.
he s totally a psyop.  calling him a circus freak is an insult to circus freaks
i think you re exactly right. dylan is so silly and ridiculous. if i was a woman i would be pissed at how the entertainment industry has put him on a pedestal. why would bud and jack daniel s have him as spokesperson  and now nike threatens its own customers that if they come out against dylan they will take action. something stinks and it s not good.
that canadian teacher was placed on unpaid leave a few years ago over a pronoun incident. making the school defend him with the same rule they used against him is kinda poetic
hi melonie  i just  discovered  your channel and immediately subscribed. i love your vibe  your talk  your looks  and the fragility you dare to expose. love from the netherlands!
if a real woman acted like this people would question her sanity.  he does it and gets brand deals  and is a media darling.  smh.
i have to admit  watching different people s reactions to his nike video have been hilarious. it s the most entertaining aspect of this.
this guy is an actor. he s not trans he s literally playing a character. that s not how real humans act that have gender dysphoria.
not crazy. this is indeed a psyop. you are spot on with everything you said.
as i understand it  that shop teacher was accused of  toxic masculinity  previously for speaking up at school meetings so he went the other extreme to test the policies through example. they were shown to be fools and are paying him to stop bringing attention to their insane policies that prevented him from being fired for it. i thought it was hilarious and the students knew why he did it.
there is a part of me that believes that dylan is trolling the world.the way he acts... it s exactly that  an act.
i agree with you. it s a more than obvious. which is why i m more concerned that he has all the attention. it s no good those of us who  know  not giving him attention   recognising the psyop - it s all those millions and billions of folk who are glued and bought into this as  real  that genuinely worries me. look what happened to riley gaines - truly terrifying.
yes  not speaking out is why we are in the mess we are in. i agree .
no woman behaves like that. dylan is actually mocking women by acting like a grotesque caricature.
i m a conservative christian. i wholeheartedly agree with everything you said! hit the nail on the head. good job.
absolutely.
i totally agree somebody is behind promoting this guy.if he really wants to be a woman and really sees himself as that then why hasn t he feminized his name like ellen page did changing her name to elliot.
agreed
dylan literally looks like a marionette.
that might explain why he hasn t had any surgeries  other than his face  to present as more  female.
he i ve heard has even went so far as having his chin and his adam s apple  feminized .
and forever shall it be.
kah boom
nooo. men and women are equal in the eyes of the lord. you are no body.
straight up
totally !!!!! now let us buy adidas
by soros  russia  and china
he is the distraction to what s happening in the world .
absolutely - 100 ... normalising transgenderism is going to make chipping and neurolinking youth  transhumanism so easy...
i think you have a very good point and i wouldn t put anything out of the reach of the crazies running this circus.
sure  and space lasers exist too
bingo....same as all the hollywood tools like nas x etc.
@kathleen king  are you trying to be smart or something
yuuuuup! are you a watcher of jay dyer perchance  if not i think you d like his work...
this!
i think you are right
ironman 3  the mandarin...
with a 5o c shadow
agree
that what the video was all about.
same with jeffrey marsh. cia fbi operative.
@kathleen king  bingo!!!
hes like a paid propergandist for an  evil empire  total part of the problem but not the problem
@britt scott  because they want to present a confused mixed up identity   it s not about really being a woman   notice someone of them wear beards
gross evil tells itself it is profitable
@gabriel  and acts like one when he throws himself around in certain happy or excited moments.
he s sold his soul. if he had one....
agreed
spot on
so the democrats.
@b smith  too simple
and loves every minute of it. jealousy is a dicease but ignorance is a choice
just like aoc
exactly and that s exactly what s taking place but not many people don t seem to realize it.....
he was not groomed he was offered money more likely walking out of a shrinks office.
sick of him making fun of biological women
i agree as well
i agree that s what i felt was going on.
i agree almost seems like a straight guy acting
lol
women are great. they are superheros in movies and they invented everything. women who used to be men are the best women. or maybe the best women are black or muslim - it s hard to keep up.

@flora amazon  god or lord meaning male
100
@chaosflower  wow  have you ever fallen hard for this idiocy as an alethophobe!  no one can change their sex.  alethomisia strikes again!
@flora amazon  while you are right in the context of the body of christ  as seen in galatians 3 28  its a bit misleading to say because when we are still in the world  the rule in 1 timothy 2 12 applies wherein women are not to try and take on the roles of men because equal does not mean symmetrical  we both serve specific roles on this side of eternity and we are not to get them crossed  because if we do it leads to people like dylan existing  as explained in romans 1 26-27  and condemned in deuteronomy 22 5
@thunder man  they were joking...
@peter harold janak jr  possibly  but it is not always obvious  whether one is joking  without some indication  because such nuances are not easily conveyed through type  alone  such as this one.
and he s one of the chess pieces on the board in this game.
@thunder man  dude  read the post again. it is quite obviously a joke  without indication  even conveyed through type.
that makes zero sense.   donnie does darryl.
what first of witch that thing is not a man i don t know what you call it   but it s definitely not a man. just call it a thing or an it.
@peter harold janak jr  no  it isn t obvious  you simply assume.  if it were a joke  do you not think that the commenter would have corrected me  by now
i had this exact thought a few days ago.  this is a maaaans world!
we do everything better than women.
just like my main man  jk rowling! such a handsome person
well said!!
if you re going to say he was discovered  recruited and groomed to play a role  then you should damn well tell us who these people are. my guess is you have no clue and are just spewing non sense.
wouldn t doubt it
right! and the way he was acting on that price is right clip  falling around in a slapstick manner befitting jerry lewis! then pretending to display the merchandise like the models. he s not real
but why  what s the catch
absolutely !!
it s why i took my name. on the premise that all the world s a stage  one big psyop. it s layered. a box of boxes. you can see what you just explained. that s hopeful. i ain t no morpheus  it s just how things work i suppose. i type this  who knows if you see it. title of video popped up for me. kinda has my name in it. more people saying psyops apparently. i created my channel in 2008. can you hear me now  again. how many layers down that ole rabbit hole  leads to another rabbit hole. a spiral wormhole. but the bottom is shutting it off and going outside. i m saying lots of things. what i m saying is what if you get stuck at a layer. it contradicts. or you re apprehensive or don t like the dark tunnel. what if you have to give up something you thought was sacred but when you go thru the wall of fire  the pain wasn t real and you find what you thought was sacred was actually profane but you ve found something infinitely more sacred and real. bah. who knows. hint. leave the multitude of gods at the door. start fresh. like you re a homo sapien  dropped off in some culture. you got amnesia but you can still think  write read  understand language. ra verse engineeer start from the shadow from a stick in the ground and rebuild time.
still  bad on anhauser busch for going along.
i agree
i thought you were going to say  it just cost him his private parts.
i would prefer my normal life and pride over all the money. the pride you can show  the money can be taken of you easily. if people built him they can also destroy him within seconds  but his pride will be destroyed forever
@h potter  all the money he s gotten  and i don t think he has actually gotten  bottom surgery .
@vincent alexander   so he s like baphomet  just missing horns.
a caricature making        in a fake age.
all he did was disprove that trans people are oppressed.
did dylan mulvaney castrate himself
yup fit right in to a seat in government
they used to call that selling your soul to satan
the bearded lady is pissed
circus freaks also have some talent. he don t!
to be a  circus freak  you ve got to have talent   thinking to the circus freaks in american horror story
the  frolic like a baby deer  where he played a girl in the park was when i knew 100  that he was acting.if he s not acting...why  after getting millions in brand deals  does he not at least go unic to fulfill his dream of  being a girl  i m just glad there s some sane humans left that can think for themselves and question authority!that quote is my favorite. it doesn t only apply to psychedelics  and the questioning authority part doesn t mean burn down local business.only to ask if the authority is being fair or making sense
at least circus freaks can put on a good show
you are right  circus freaks are awesome  dylan  not so much.
all the political theater and nonsense of all this stuff is to keep you distracted and worrisome over nonsensical issues that doesn t even really matter  when everything crumbles  no one is going to give a hoot  about any of this silly gender nonsense and other social issues.
@stephanie  fairly sure he hasn t. maybe he ll do it once he hits his first period and is officially a wo-man  shrug. who knows tho.
i m convinced he going come out later saying he was trolling
it cannot be explained any better. as a man  everything i do  money i make is for one thing only  my dignity. now a days  if you ready to loose your dignity  you can make money.
i know your joking but seems like some people are missing the main point which by the way is the main topic of the video   that is that it isn t even possible for him to take any credit for anything because he is a character created   inserted into mainstream pop culture purposely. it s not like he s just a self made celebrity that got lucky   just randomly secured all kinds of endorsements. that doesn t usually happen in real life he is everywhere because some key influential entities want him to be.
sounds like hollywood in general.
@here we are  exactly
trans dorianne grey
there s no credit in that. he only said yes to ego and greed....
@stephanie  not yet  just had face done  or so he claims.  he still looks the same when he isn t made up.
@h potter  didn t cost him that. dylan hasn t chopped himself nor is he taking any hormone treatment. he has done nothing that isn t 100  reversible.
@john doe  his facial feminizing surgery
@h potter  completely reversible. bottom surgery and hormone treatment are not reversible. in addition  his facial surgery was minor. he has not had any laser surgery done to remove his facial hair nor has he had his adam s apple removed. he hasn t  and i m guessing never will  do anything permanent as he is a method actor. he is just playing a part for views. that s it. he s an actor  and he s finally  successful.
@d  yes  but they are always surprised when satan calls a knocking for the debt to be paid
@h potter  roflmao
100  i fully expect to find out he has an uncle or something that s a cia spook.
yeah  how dare people insult ty lee from atla like that
nailed it.
what is a psyop
@ryan jonsson  psychological operation
the bearded lady   addison rose vincent  tried out for the part but it was too challenging and he got benched after matt walsh schooled him on dr phil.so - yes  dylan is a plant.
i hope you all realize this is exactly what was happening in berlin in the 1920 s before you know who came to power...
@joebauers3746   it was happening in moscow and beijing when you know who else were in power
@purple pill philosophy  uh never heard of that but if true is was for inverse reasons as you know who in 1930 s germany shut that behavior down as it was those who took power in moscow in 1917 who were pushing it.
@bert kilborne  what s funny is that addison actually passes better than dylan even with the facial hair.
@giovannirastrelli9821   hell  even l look more feminine than either
ikr  i used to work with a small circus that had one of the last freak shows  and i got to be good friends with two of the freaks  they were  siamese twins   aka conjoined twins  who loved the circus -- there s a lot of camaraderie  and you get to travel and visit new places  and everyone respects each other because we all have to work together.
hold my bud light.
how far will he go to do their bidding we will find out
@jerome isaacs   cut off his bacon  did he cut off his bacon already  hmm  i can t tell with these creatures
@lisa roberts  he still got it he calls it the bulge it s insane
is it just me or does dylan mulvaney have a smile that looks just like the serial killer john wayne gacy s smile when he dressed up as  pogo the clown
she s beautiful  is she
insert disraction
exactly. what did the circus freaks do to deserve such an insult. lol
@purple pill philosophy  oh ok thx i knew there was something fishy going on with him
@jerome isaacs   he has a candy bar endorsement deal  dylan s nut tuck .
totally agree!  expose the   behind the cult
@w m  bud light  expendable  another distraction. nonsense and non issues to keep you from looking at your own situation.
@dale bob if he goes eunuch  he can t still plow that s probably why
@w m  i agree  they should be more worried about the ai robots that are being built to replace humans.  they should also be more worried about the mark of the beast technology that is being introduced into society.
paid actor to distract   lower sales of bud lite
at least circus freaks are entertaining
amen
i used to go to a circus when i was a kid to watch the freak shows  now i can watch dylan mulvaney
there s always at least one sp  k in the mix.
this is absolutely correct.
nobody is holding one of those  anymore.
lol...dude giving off some serious pogo vibes.
i know!..the cheek of nike is soo about face i couldn t believe they took that angle!.like wtf ..we re ur customers we want trainers   sports bra s we  don t need life lessons   a telling off...
he used the system against them and it worked! what an absolute mad lad!
genius move on his part
just thought i d say hi...thought it d be funny if your last name was gonz lez
yup
yeah and people try to argue that  well he had ff surgery so that confirms he is dysphoric . i don t think so. he s an actor and actors will do all kinds of things to their appearance for the fame and fortune they re seeking. and just a theory but because he s also gay    i don t think ff surgery for a flamboyantly gay guy like him is such a big deal.. not if he makes money and gets him plenty attention.
@jessieg there s also a lot you can do with lighting  makeup  etc... it s very possible even that surgery wasn t real.
@papa bear  that s what i think too! i don t believe his face was reconstructed at all because he would have been putting the pictures of him all bruised up from the surgery plastered everywhere that actually happened  i never imagined 20 years ago as in 18 year old that there would be men pretending to be women that make millions of dollars.i would have picked a different route not really....i like my pole and it s ability to part those sugar walls as the hodge twin s say!
not that good of an actor watch his appearance on the price is right he was acting stupid  like he does now  let s face it he has been this way all his life
@jessieg  unfortunately underaged people gravitate to him.. really that s the only thing that bugs me.... he tries to act like a child and kids watch him
@lorrie  hes only a  plant  for the kids! hes not here to get any adults to change lol thats why its 365 days of  girlhood  not a women
if that s true   that s hilarious! is there information that backs this up
@anima animus  tell this to the liberals.
many of his handmaids argue  this is just how she deals with her dysphoria!  i don t think gender dysphoria means what they think it means.
@jessieg  that ffs is definitely a red herring. he s not trans.
he s playing a character so he is trans. he s just more successful that the other  female  cos players
i agree.  i just watched a clip of his and you could see that he hadn t shaved his underarms in a long time and if he really was trans  he would have gotten implants by now.  he can afford it.  but he hasn t.  makes ya think.
wasnt this fool on the price is right many years ago as a gay man acting a complete fool
this looks more like mk ultra
no-one is trans. it s not a real thing.
exactly... i had a friend and at the time he was bi and had a gf and he would hit on us but kept boundaries  never tried touching us or making moves he knew we werent in that group so he would just compliment us sometimes but idk f it he was cool and it was nice lol. besides the point he went full tranzformer for awhile and was never religous and used to always be against it but now hes a full blown christian  a boy again and is totally against this and the rainbow mafia. he still treats ppl that are flamboyant with respect but the weirdos pushing all of this he like wants to destroy lol. he said all of thia stuff started waking him up to what was really going on and now hes like on a mission to take these ppl down lol.
@jerome isaacs   thats what i said in my comment!
exactly ..dylan is not a woman and he knows it... he is an actor  nothing more.his past want to be hollywood career and acting in general was in the toilet. then he became more popular by doing gay acting. then he found a new niche .... acting like a woman as a fake trans.he constantly mocks women at the same time gets millions of dollars. interesting fact  he refuses to get bottom surgery... i wonder why
he s a freak just like the rest of em
speaking of plants. when dylan turns 60 those implants won t look so good.
@tony hansen  to be fair  bottom surgery is a mixed bag and can go wrong. not every trans women get it. however  that doesn t negate him acting like one. david bowie is more of a trans woman that this guy.
@saltedroastedcaramel  good point...i am 58 years old and still learning about all this trans and gender identification thing. it makes my head spin and gives me an aneurysm
@tony hansen well you sound pretty opinionated to admittedly have no clue what youre talking about
oh my! he s creepy to me  and even makes me feel nuasea. hope i don t sound exaggerated but that what he makes feel like. sick
@papa bear  oh good point. he honestly doesn t look that different to me. just lots of makeup.
@jessieg  i don t even think he did. i think he uses makeup and faked the hospital shot. he looks the exact same as a man.
@ancient spirits of evil  nope  thats how we all feel  in fact i feel more things that i can t express online.
@jerome isaacs   it is! i already said that weeks ago
well he messed with his face so lol l for him
nothing more than a freaky gay man.
@i am shewhowalksalone  does anyone just find him annoying as hell   i wouldn t be able to be in his presence for more than 1 minute.
@johannes pilvikukka  gender pretenders
@2stroke tyson  and we need to speak openly about why children are being targetted.
my gay brother in law calls it silly f@  shit.
@tony hansen  i m 65 and have always kept an open mind. not with this garbage. it s sickening
he admits he has not always being playing this role. whatever days of girlhood had a start date. before then male still male now role playing for income.
i hate to say it but i have to disagree. the insanity is growing and more and more freaks like him are being put into the spotlight.
how would you know what real gender dysphoria feels like unless you have experienced it yourself
@saltedroastedcaramel  stop calling them women
just like the guy in canada that wore the giant breasts.  i said that was bs from day 1 and everyone said i was a a whole for saying that. now we find out it was all bs.  funny those people that said i was a idiot now look like the idiots.
@papa bear  i agree!
@papa bear  this is what i have been thinking  too.  if it was real  he only had a minimal amount of work  because he just looks the same as he did before surgery  when he isn t made up.  i even question the hormones  because he is not looking more feminine from them.  makeup and lighting are amazing tools for making illusion appear to be real.
i agree but what really sucks is he making a bunch of money
@cheyenne  annoying is putting it mildly!
@brian mck  yeah  that fact makes dylan look so suspicious as a psyop.
@thunder man  what is a psyop
don t need to be vet to know what a fake dog is.
it s called  woman face .
@g v  menstrual show
@oaxacachaka
@oaxacachaka  lmaooooo
no  he is not trying to be a woman. he calls himself a girl. meaning a prepubescent woman  a girl.  he is a grown man pretending to be a young girl. it s very disturbing
@bradley smith  fr
@oaxacachaka  best comment.  and you know dylan loves tampons.
thank you for this video. i thought i was the only one who has been wondering if dylan is a psyop
i think that dylan is an experiment to see how much we the people will actually tolerate. i am glad to see we  the people standing up to show their utter disrespect it is
yes  he is !! very good - this is not a misstep in a marketing department  this is all designed to divide us .
you go girl i don t know how i bumped into your video but i m proud that you and keep up the good work
the thing about dylan is  he doesn t come off like a woman  he comes off like a manic gay boy in a dress. that s the vibe he gives. also  it s important to remember that he s a failed actor. he is always performing  because it s showtime! i he has found the role of a lifetime.
i ve been thinking this too. in fact  it s funny because i commented exactly this on another video earlier  then i come across your video. dylan mulvaney going from being a complete nobody to being everywhere all the time seemingly overnight definitely seems like an astroturf psy-op.
first time watching this channel but i m glad to see more content like this getting out there. plus a cute women to look at while digesting these disgusting issues is helpful.
we must all keep pushing back and speaking out no matter what.
100  correct. we were quiet about it for so long because it had been hammered into our heads that compassion and tolerance were the order of the day and anything that deviated from pro-lgbtq doctrine would be met with harsh resistance and phobic accusations. but clearly that made us complicit in an absurd master plan to normalize the absurd. right now i would love to hear a 1990 andrew dice clay describe dylan mulvaney in that video of him prancing around in the backyard with his women s workout garb on.
thanks for sharing your perspective! sounds about right! i find it interesting that the narrative now allows us to speak out against it. reminds me of the nurses... heros one year and zeros the next. every group of individuals is being cancelled currently. i ll probably go live soon and talk about this while blowing glass. come join me!
do you know how depressed i d be if women actually looked like him   thank jesus christ for real women
as a meat eating  vodka drinking norseman and viking i must confess that you makes my heart sing especially when you talk talk through your laughter  that is so cute
you are so right.  these companies knew there would be a backlash and that the stocks would fall  that would cause a ripple effect on many pensions that hold their stock  i would look intoanyone who shorted these stocks just before the dylan endorsements.  if you wanted to bring down industry and country while making money doing it  this would be a great way to do it.
new viewer and now follower! thank you for saying this! he went to acting college in chicago and was on broadway when the lockdown started. that s when he went viral! he needed a job.
brilliant and kindness towards these sad people review of this topic is amazing.  you re right  i was a live and let live person a long time ago  until i realized what they are doing to our kids in the schools.
loved this take on the mulvaney freakshow. you gained a new sub.
dylan is a corporate plant. he s managed by creative artists agency  a powerful talent management firm that has worldwide influence and represents some of the most famous stars across all platforms. they astroturfed his meteoric rise to fame and turned him into a brand. he s a synthetic thing  a manufactured good  little more than a sentient advertising billboard.
the reality crafted for us through the media is a giant psyop... analogous to the move   the matrix.
honestly i feel blessed to have your voice out in the world
just another way to divide us to the point of aggression. i think you re correct  we should ignore it and begin to live our lives the way we see fit instead of the way the world has been  trying to force us to. this idiocy is freeing us  lol.
@laura willoughby  maybe y all can be galpals and swap tampons. i know that s the kinda things gals do for each other!
acts like a nut case  no amount of money is worth your integrity! he plays the fool!
he acted like that before he did all this.  he acted like a flamboyant gay man.  he had a high voice even for a guy.  he was on the price is right and acted like this  caused a spectacle on it.  attention seeker.
so true.
@bradley smith  he looks a hard 45
yes and i don t appreciate it!
women don t do that. i know you watch them do that sh   on tv  but have you ever actually met and talked to a woman  doesn t sound like it.
@bradley smith  woo ur on to something
imo if its mainstream and it follows a path where every corp wants a piece  its a psy op
blaire white  a trans woman  even says he has gay boy vibes. plus  he s feels so fake. even gay men  like jeffrey star  james charles and all the gay male beauty gurus don t act like him
@saltedroastedcaramel  because dylan is playing a character and we know it. he s an actor acting.
if dylan is being paid to act like a woman  he has failed horribly! its more like watching the gay guy bounce!
if you haven t seen it look up him on the price is right. he s a gay dude playing a part.
if i saw any woman looking and acting this way  i would run the other way. as he is a male i look at him like i would a train wreck
yes like an old skool drag act  but without the comedy or personality
also expanding the role playing the   city kid  totally disgusting
you are not wrong
even if he admitted it  it would make no difference to the people who support his type of behavior. that s the truly scary part.
he sold his soul to the devil for fame and money.
dylan twinklife
he doesn t come off like a woman  he comes off like a manic gay boy in a dress  so he s alfred ashford
took the words out of my mouth
a cute woman  i can t stand when people don t understand women is plural.
e
you win the comments
.
true...
look at it this way  if women did look like this  we wouldn t know any better.  but because they don t...and because of the human discernment god gives every one of us  we do.
looks don t matter   it s the way he s acting like women actually act like that.
or just acted like him...
reminds me of cherie blair
you express zero masculinity through this comment  don t ever do  whatever this is  again.
amen to that!
thank the lord for real men too !!
show some respect
word up my guy i d rather live alone and  take care of myself
look i m old school. the weekly reader said cars would fly in the year 2000 but they never said anything to us about this stuff
@world class satanist he needs to show some respect.
do you know how depressed i d be if women actually acted like him   he represents no one.
haha
he s a man so you re still ok.
lol seeing him bop around like a wooden poppet combined with your comment gave me a strong gut laugh .
thank you!!!
i mean you wouldn t know better but i totally agree
amen.
and if they acted like him .good lord  i d voluntarily go celebrate
if all women looked like him the population of the world would be zero.
if real women looked and acted like this dude i think we would have a barren planet.
as a real woman  mulvaney looks better than me. us uggo women exist as well.
love it  thank you
yes  we do need to strongly stand against their ideology of lies  especially for the children  but also for the good of everyone.
elegantly put!
creepy  innit
yup... he is not him or her.
@jennifer knight  barely even an  it.
and this is one of the reasons why i laugh when people say he s rich.if he was paid 150k from bud light  how much of that did the agency take you also need a lawyer when you sign contracts. how much did the lawyer take personal assistant. manager.he s a pretend rich.
@natsohigh !  i don t think dylan is smart enough to get a lawyer  he completely belongs to creative artists agency and they re screwing him three ways from sunday.
lol maybe even an ai or clone
@sarah byrtus  a youtube ad break with a circulatory system.
i knew something was up - thanks for the information.
they will soon run out of brands to sacrifice.
i believe you! it s all so strange how this dylan guy just showed up out of nowhere
how long r his frikkin arms  that s sum looooong arms
he is a self proclaimed worlds best troll and has a background in acting and i think he s either planted or the is going to be dylan s best act yet.
110  this!
was he put in place to create a super short on bud stock.
@john mcinnis  i think creative artists agency worked dylan into the ground and now it s backfiring because people are literally sick of him. he does every single promotion thrown at him  his association is beginning to cheapen the brands.
does he have any family cause i couldn t find anything.
@s sanday  creative artists agency is probably holding them hostage.
i might have to argue the use of word  sentient  here. i m not so sure.....
any man  woman or creature represented by cas is a performer.
who are the puppeteers and how do we destroy them!!
..and what about tampax...really   when was the last time any man used a tampon for anything except a nose bleed or diarrhea
where did you get this info  i d like to learn more about it.
@s sanday  check on the crisis actor list. maybe you ll find them there.
@sarah byrtus  that s more my thinking. either way  he is is fake!!
yes.
this feels so close to truth its terrifying
wait a second are you calling him a  trans plant
you have nailed it in a perfect way  giovanni!  thanks for the info.
well said
couldn t have said it better myself
this is 100  correct  this dill pickle dude is a walking lie.
before that.
@jennifer knight  hes a man he doesnt no way in hell  look female
@mark sutherland  jr.  because it is the truth.
i appreciate that you get it. it is so obvious and sad that people don t get it.
dylan has been trying to find his niche in the social media world for years now. if you look back to the beginning of his so called career  he s tried a number of different tactics to get himself to gain traction. when he came out as trans he hit pay dirt  but it was a years long attempt with his narcissistic self to find what works. he is still very much a he and i can guarantee you he has no intentions of transitioning and he ll eventually de-transition when that becomes more popular.
dude is definitely a psyop.  thanks for talking about this.  we need more people like you addressing this open deception.
thank you for making a video about it. i m almost certain that s the case. the devil runs this system of things  and darkness will come to light
the mock titty troll is perfect. he  as a potentially real person was being forced to accept the unacceptable. so he said  how this  is this insane enough to stop this nonsense.  and the system wouldn t say boo.
thanks for your bravery in speaking out. as long as women are silent and allow these passive-aggressive incels to mock and insult us their bad behavior will continue and they will continue to be paid and praised for their ugliness and cancerous contributions toward degrading society.
paranormal is quite a thing these days . but if you really want a full apparition of a demon   look no further   .love your show   first time viewer
you got to hand it to her  she has balls to do what she is doing.
it s funny seeing you and dylan side by side. you can just see  regardless of the surgery  makeup and camera angles that he s a bloke and you re a woman. it s just something you can identify immediately  something innate that everyone can see even if they can t explain itwe live in such a delusional world  people repeat lines and slogans without thinking even if they know it s completely untrue
this is such an insult to real women. i have never seen a woman act like him. thanks for your voice. god bless you.
you are 100  right. i think it is like when you find you have cancer and you do nothing hoping it ll get better  you are doomed. but if you find you have cancer and you start fighting back  you have a good chance of winning.
he has had a whole film crew from the beginning.   a choreographer.  do you think he has done all his filming from his cell phone    btw.  the little bumps in his sports bra is the little trick we used is probably kleenex
melonie! how refreshing it is to see someone in a very public view not pander to what s  relevant . you are so firm in your beliefs. i love you and your channel! blessings
dylan has givin creators like yourself a hot topic to get views and grow your channel.
when i m forced to see him  my stomach turns. i get physical nausea  and i m sure i m not alone in that. so why do brands think associating their product with this creep is going to sell said product
i live down the highway from the teacher with the gigantic chest. he is on paid leave right now. i suspect it will become a legal situation and he will win against the school board. his teaching of teenagers looking like that could have been solved early by kids refusing to go to his class. the entire situation is nuts. as far as dylan  he s not transitioning  he s dressing as a woman.  actually  he repeatedly stated this is his  girlhood .  he s seeking to be a little girl which i can t understand at all.  nike are out of their minds if they think this man represents women.  i would go as far as to say i m insulted by this situation. he wanted attention  he s got it.  hopefully this situation with major retailers will die down because this man absolutely does not represent women.
does it always sound like he is almost cracking up laughing hysterically
i wonder how dylan will feel about single handedly bringing down these companies. of  course the companies that hired him take a lot of blame
i told my gf just the other day that this dude rocketed to where he is sitting front of the president and everything so fast it s quite possible that he s the tool of the elite just like you re saying. when i saw your video i was like  oh i m not alone !
dylan may not even be aware of it  but he is definitely part of an ongoing psyop. controlled opposition media is just as focused on him as the advertisers. in reality he is an irrelevant nobody  but we re all being conditioned to care about him either in a positive or deeply negative way. meanwhile  things that matter far more continue to get ignored.
i thought the title said psycho.
when something comes out of nowhere and is suddenly the talk of the town - psyop.
according to some people  dylan just had facial surgery nothing more.
the first thing that came to my mind when saw melonie  simply natural femaleness.
there are trans that can definitely pass  dylan isn t one of them.
my favorite station - minitunes  but you call them commercials  . . . . .     from demolition man
i just commented this i was like theres no way dylan looks that good
i believe he got so little work done and the things she pointed out of how he isn t even on hormones that this man is like this on purpose and just changes out off camera. he s a cross dre--no a drag queen or what used to be called a transvestite  not transsexual.
we ve evolved over thousands of years to estimate female fertility through a number of physical characteristics.
it kinda looks like her little brother
@saltedroastedcaramel  i swear these surgeons who are supposed to be making men into women with this superior tech and shit  still fail to completely erase all the male features.it s like they leave a hint on purpose.
@kelly  it s almost as if it s impossible to make a man truly look like a female. dm has broad shoulders and man hands. he has even attempted to change his voice. he s not trans  he s just putting on  woman face . i m a  bigot  for not bowing to the insanity. he s a gay dude that has probably signed a deal in blood for fame. and to be honest  i m a straight white male  the most  dangerous demographic in the world   and i am pissed off on women s behalf.
blaire white could have fooled me if i didn t know better lmao
not just a woman. smart and beautiful!
@angus beef  exactly what i thought
because money talks but it will backfire.
esg money  plain and simple.  the old profit model has been thrown away.  they don t need to make a profit when organizations like blackrock are willing to pay these corporations to push  the message .the short-sightedness of these companies is that esg money sounds great on paper - push a message  don t worry about the quality of the product or pr.  here s the problem   that money dries up real fast when your product or company is no longer considered relevant.  then you re left high and dry  your brand ruined  and the powers that be move on to the next foolish  greedy company.
it s because the marketing departments do the math and figure a  50k ad spend with an influencer with 10 million followers will give them a good return on investment. they figure followers are followers. people are pretty set in their ways about brand preference when they hit 40  years old  so they target young people. the data they have says that young people are more socially progressive overall. i think companies are starting to  get it . my  very large  employer is pushing environmental messaging a lot harder this year vs. woke messaging last year. the superbowl ads this year were less woke than before.
@jeremy f  i strongly suspect that the market research and marketing departments are a huge factor in this. a few years ago  market research firms were hiring social media savvy young people  meaning always online  and executives are not noted for having good scientific caution with the raw twitter data and other stuff that can be misleading at best or manipulated at worst.given the way that some companies conflate brand mentions with positive advertising  i strongly suspect someone ran an algorithm that identified mulvany as a way to get lots of mentions but didn t think if it would have long-term brand damage. you can see similar messes with bad a b testing. the executives have stopped thinking beyond easy to identify metrics and the woke executives can use those isolated numbers to bludgeon the doubts of the rest.
@justhereforcookies  i wish it were only about money  it s not.  and they know it  but they are willing to pioneer it in the hopes that the abnormal becomes normalized.
you re definitely not alone
brands   selling products  what products  the social justice is the product they re selling. if you buy the bud light  that s just a bonus for them.
stunning and brave
he ll probably think he s super powerful
@roma rose   maybe
it s not about money it s about evolving society and then burning it to the ground
same
and biden kamala
it s not about pleasing customers. they are in the process of creating new customers pushing narratives. this is about e.s.g. scoring and has nothing to do with pleasing customers any longer.
hey  i thought it was just me... oh my gosh  the only fact of thinking it makes me feel what you just described.
because it does sell. duh. it s called capitalism
pepto maybe
what sickens  me even  more is he was invited  to the white  house
because they do it to frustrate you as a culture war.
exactly. you  i  and millions of others will boycott them - they know that. and no company would alienate the majority of it s customer base without somebody funding them to do this.  this is not a commercial decision  it is a funded piece of propaganda.
yes he s an actor. acting background. doors opened to easy. lightning striking over and over.
great reply on this entire subject!!  happy easter!! just watched your show and i really enjoyed it so i subscribed. i completely agree with you  someone else would definitely be doing it! maybe even worse  nothing wrong with being a christian in these godless days. good for you!!
we need need to get off social media. and watch them go crazy because they don t know what is happening with us.
ive never seen your videos  so this such a coincidence  i was literally just thinking the same thing the other day about dillion being a plant. however  i was thinking he must be related to someone in power in order to get the deals he s gotten  but maybe he was just some random guy desperate for fame and they thought he d be right for the job.
you hit the nail on the head  he is a puppet for their agenda and sad for real women everywhere  this movement really does make women second tier to sick men like him
there s no way he s getting out of this alive. he is constantly questioning himself and seeking the internal validation  and he cannot find it. i see why these kinds of things end up in tragedy. he always comes across as depressed. they don t can t fill that hole in the soul. it never will.
you hit the nail on the head  young lady!
wow  i had to google the definition of psyop. it had not occurred to me but it s a very interesting theory   your arguement is strong.
this dude s another perfect example of normal vs. crazy
one word sums this person up. money. he has to be notorious to get the hits so the sponsorship can be garnered. he has a full production team behind him and they have to be paid.
what s odd to me is that the price is right footage just now was  leaked  which makes it seem dylan has been doing this acting thing for awhile
as a man  i see a difference a mile away between dylan  the woman  and melonie wearing football clothes and tattoos as far as who is a woman  so i think its time we reject bad cosplay as bad cosplay and tell any kids in our lives the truth
i think you re amazing. keep waking people up.
i just subscribed to your channel your spitting facts damn i love it
i 100  believe that he has been planted. i almost thought that maybe he had an identical twin sister and that dylan is still out there being dylan but then he has his identical twin sister doing this other stuff because this is nuts. i m not a huge conspiracy theorist... however i feel like there s something major going on in the world.. that things are being thrown out there to camouflage with drama to keep us from freaking out about what s happening because all of the things that are going on right now truly is mind boggling
i think ur right! they are probably producing all their influencers in a lab
i was just thinking how i d wish you speak more on the things of god even though this channel is a pop culture one and immediately you did. respect haha! much love sister and may god bless you and keep you close!     also i agree psyop for sure.
he s definitely destroying brands. nike and bud light will regret this.
dylan is making the greatest documentary of all time.
they know they backlash will be spectacular. i wonder how many people were given the heads up and sold their shares before tshtf.
nah. no such thing as bad publicity.also  what   you gonna boycott bud light  we re you drinking bud light in the first place  didn t think so.
yes i already have
@grindel ston  about 75  of beer is owned by the same company... just make sure to drink one that isn t.
lightening struck the gf mural painted on the side of the building straight in the face. through the side.
sadly i agree with you on his likely quick slide into more insanity and depression with him ultimately dying and becoming a martyr  for the  trans cause .
i totally agree  after they no longer have any use for him   they make him disappear
i m waiting for the day they are done with dylan  and he snuffs it on tic tack.
it s a curse and a blessing. the curse is that it screws up the person s mind. the blessing is that they eventually eliminate themselves. it s sad that eventually the game they are playing ends in tragedy.
@angus khan  he can always call up drew barrymore to hold his hand.
theres a hole in his soul because he sold it for monetary gain.
this is one hundred percent accurate
@petey wheatstraws  the sooner the better.
@cheyenne  sadly drew fell off ages and ages ago too. tom green makes more sense than she does these days
sadly  i think there s a good shot of truth in that.
the only thing that can fill the emptiness in dylan and everyone else is god. god designed us to have an empty space inside our spirits but we are supposed to fill it with god  not material items  relationships  addictions or obsessions.
nah... he is just acting and getting his pocket full of money.
even darwin would be like  what the complete fck
@maria c.  like they do with everyone! once they are done with him  what s gonna happen  that money is gonna have to maintain his new life style he bought a home  hopefully he invested that money into something
you are giving this guy way too much credit. he s just an actor playing a role. they all are..
not suprising considering she was doing coke when she was just 8 years old.
agreed. there s no way in hell that this thing is getting out of this alive. 2a
ain t that the truth!
no one ever does mate
27 is their high-bell-curve shelf life.the ones who figure out pornhub make it to their 30 s  but remember that this is the group who wears their ray bans with the mirrors on the insides.
that s because you don t know what a real woman is
she s wearing steelers paraphernalia while living in texas.  that is a psyop!
so much this!  couldnt have said it better myself.
yeah this is the thing- the comparison shouldn t even need to be made  this whole thing is so ridiculous and insulting. this movement has further gendered everything x100. i saw an advertisement for legos from the 1970s and it was a little red headed tough looking girl wearing overalls. i think she had short hair  too  something like that. or it was in a messy ponytail. my point is that i was actually pretty sad after i saw that. we were making progress. now look where we are. we are so detached from our bodies that now the superficial somehow makes you one gender or the other.edited to add the decade it was from. fifty years ago.
i didn t mind at first but it s getting odd now
good cosplay or rather being in a costume than being one s natural self is still wearing a costume.
i don t want the kids anyway that s a bad karma bad juju beans
let s make it stick...1000  permanent boycott!!!
anheuser-busch needs to regret this they are the ones that own bud light. they own plenty of beer brands so if we don t boycott them all anheuser-busch will be fine.
nike was lost when colin kapernick became the face of just do it.
lol! this week you shake your fist at nike and bud light  next you all will be back!the rights boycotts have never worked!
yeah. don t worry about trump being arrested. boycott bud light.
@skullythehypnoskull  worrying helps no one.  knock down every ridiculous mascot and lie they put up.
and now jack daniels
@jonwwillis thats an easy boycott i don t drink beer at all. i do however own some kitchen aid stuff  throwing them away is pointless  will wait until they need to be replaced and buy from a different brand.
normalize the bulge- dylan mulvaney
no they will still be payed
brands are destroying themselves!
inbev that own budweiser and many other beers and brands needs to be included on the don t buy list.
@nunya bidness  frank sinatra is rolling in his grave.
@bill akers  pretty safe bet that bud light was already on a lot of people s don t buy list before this.
bud light is not a beer. get a real beer. corona. modelo
nike and bud are going to be fine.  nobody cares.  it s women that should be calling out how he is acting like a caricature cosplay of a woman.
he s put me in a real predicament   i ve been wearing nike apparel my whole life   46   first kapernick and now this ...... f  k nike wth are y all thinking.....
i haven t bought nike or a lot of other brands for years because of their anti-2a stances.  this is just more of their useless drivel. it s not surprising to me.
don t forget jack daniels
no one will miss nike  budweiser   tampax  or other brands that think it s cool
you  i  and millions of others will boycott them - they know that. and no company would alienate the majority of it s customer base without somebody funding them to do this.  this is not a commercial decision  it is a funded piece of propaganda.
just like gillette  make them hurt.
unfortunately  they don t care. all these brands that went woke are still around. they still have alot of money. they ve been paid off
i imagine some people are going to make good money by shorting their stocks.
@skullythehypnoskull  people can care and take on more than one thing.
let s not forget ulta
lol you re more delusional than dylan if you believe that
@daryl yost  naw. plenty of beer that isn t ab owned. same with shoe brands
@robimusprime  both owned by anheuser-busch
nike will survive they always do because a certain segment of society will kill for them shoes.
@robimusprime  corona and modelo are owned by anheiser-busch   the makers of bud light  michelob ultra  rolling rock  st paulie girl  stella artois and more.
yes they only have so many brands to sacrifice and are going to run out before long. the company behind it have a range of products and all of them are on the blacklist now.
tractor supply got on board too.
the esg bribes investments will make up for the losses  at least for now. they re going to be pretty upset when the esg money suddenly dries up and the customers are still gone though  but by then the damage will have been done.
@robimusprime  both of those are owned by ab inbev. no point in boycotting bud light if you only switch to another brand owned by the same people.
@skullythehypnoskull  why should we worry about charges based entirely on politics that don t hold water on constitutional  factual  or legal grounds  while i definitely believe a ny jury may convict him regardless of the total lack of evidence  i m pretty sure an appellate court will see the charges for the garbage they are.
bud got heat an nike thought it was a good idea to use him lol
@jonwwillis  god damn it   thank u for telling me that . i didn t know just bought a case of beer
@skullythehypnoskull  didn t he just win 600 000 from a court case
the last time a boycott truly worked was the 1955 montgomery bus boycott. it worked because the people who were the greatest consumers of public transportation stopped riding public buses. boycotts generally don t work that way these days because capitalism is a hell of a drug.
i ve known this since the beginning  if you know and follow psyops. just waiting for someone to finally say it in the media. lol you just got yourself a subscriber.
these companies hiring this type of clowns are absolutely insane and with complete disregard of who we are as women. so embarrassing. this needs to stop...yesterday.
that is something i have thought deeply about  melonie. he definitely downplays the significance and beauty of being a woman. he s making fun of what it is to be a woman. all women should be upset and offended that some guy sees your daily life as this garbage he puts up. it s degrading. great video  melonie.   goblackandgold
i ve been saying that for a while now  they make themselves way to obvious!! he s a parody and they are using him as a distraction so be careful of what we can t see more than what we can see!!
in real life dylan is the guy in the store you pull your kids away from when he s creeping around the aisles.
i love this!! i love love love that you are bringing in the spiritual warfare!! girl go!! no satan not today!!
the testosterone part is amazing.  i cant get testosterone supplements cover by my insurance.  however  my insurance would cover if it was for gender dysforia.  its amazing because they wont cover for having low testosterone
@melonie thank you for standing up for what you believe in!
dylan went to acting school in cincinnatti ohio and was on broadway in new york.once the lockdowns came and work disappeared he shifted to tiktok and became an instant sensation playing the role of a trans woman.actors do what they have to do to make it by creating a new character and since the trans movement is going nuts he capitalized on it.just an actor nothing else.
you re being too nice here  i cannot believe people can t see this with their waking eyes! normal people don t behave this way  crazy people don t behave this way  evil possessed people do.
i know i m tired about seeing him. we need more people speaking out about this. could be a plant
instead of focusing on this. i did a little research last night using tiktok and was ask all these young ladies what there thoughts were on men competing in women s sports. and i was shocked by the responses that most of them gave. and that was they didn t want to get this controversial question. so i figured it was because they were live in front of a few thousand people so i gave them the the opportunity to email me privately and i wake up today with no response from none of them. now with that being said i did find a very small group of young ladies who were not in favor of it and think that it s disgusting how things are being taken away from them. and i also found a large group of young ladies who said they didn t even care. and had said exactly what you said let people be who they want to be. but when you try to explain to them it s not letting people be who they want to be that s the problem it s taking away from one group to give to another group with a advantage that is the problem. they either don t want to hear it or try to understand it  so it would be nice if you could do a episode covering something like this to help bring more light to this topic. thanks
the moment i realized he was a plant was when he made a comment to someone about the internet being forever and that those who spoke against him would be sorry in the future.
agree! he s a character planted to normalize deviancy!!!
i agree with you melanie. i always thought just don t talk about it but i think that caused the problem so let s try a change of tactics
absolutely a psyop! i spent 8 yrs in spec ops and 4 yrs as a cia contractor this has all the tell tale signs.
iv been saying these things to my wife  i m glad i found this channel....the whole entertainment industry has a demonic presence
you re not crazy  you are spot on!!
this is a very interesting take and you may well be right. subscribed!
when a narcissist will do anything for clicks  they ll sell their soul to every company that gets their face on social media
in real life dylan is the 26-year old gender studies major who sells ice cream at the local swimming pool.
nah  he s just a boring actor.
jadon and willow smith don t even get this much of a push  combined.
we need less people talking about dilly boy  not more.
most of the time one can  work out  what general reason s  those spending the big bucks are looking to accomplish. this overly pushing of the trans thing has me stumped. guys have been porking other guys for many centuries so this isn t  new  in that sense. but attempting to create a nation of catamites simply eludes my reasoning skills. sure girls stuff costs more in general but that just isn t enough although looking at other countries beefing up at the same time is worrying.
@terry landess  if you assume there s some demonic influence  i don t think most of these people are aware they re being tempted led down these paths   it makes more sense than any other explanation. why else do this kind of crazy shit on a societal level
has mm been tutoring him  they have a lot in common.    a couple of days after biden became commander of chief of disbelief i felt like there was something bad released in the atmosphere worldwide. the enemy has doubled down. its great to have found your channel
that scene of him dancing is hilarious. this man  or whatever he is  is a genius of physical comedy. similar to charlie chaplain or buster keaton.  he s clearly self-mocking and a has a great sense of humour. just look at his antics in this way  it s all fine and it becomes entertaining. the world s not collapsing because of some obvious gender clown.
may have possibly been planted  actually made me laugh out loud....took yall long enough to realize.
i could watch a horror movie and have no issues. upon seeing dylan i start to feel nauseous  and a bit anxious.
it s nice finding another voice of reason to add to my intake off issues.
spot on! the 15 minutes of fame of this freak are lasting so much more than it should  so it raises a lot of eyebrows  mine included.
it s my belief that he s just an actor playing a role  i say that because everything he s done so far he can  undo  the one thing he couldn t undo would be bottom surgery and with all the surgeries he has had he hasn t had bottom surgery  if he really felt like a female you d think that would be his first procedure.
thank you for speaking out bc you re a female me as a man just gets called hateful for speaking the truth more woman need to speak up on this topic
you where soo on point in this video.  my neck is soar from agreeing with you lol
i really would just like an actual woman to represent us correctly.
just found your channel  i like it. keep up the good fight sister. subscribed.
once that actress cut her breasts off and became a male  we haven t heard much about it. i m not sure dylan cut it off yet. so do they support those that don t get the surgery and toss those that do aside because they did what they were told and no longer have a use
agree with you    young lady!!!
you re right!  it almost seems like he s making fun of us because women don t act like that. he s trolling us. lol
when the thrill of the notoriety is gone  dylan is headed for severe depression. of course  you know who will be blamed.
melonie is taking minimalism to the extreme. i m surprised the curtains are still there
he has been an op years in the making they put him on the price is right for that exact reason they wanted to test the water with him to see how the public would respond to his personality
i m so glad melonie has a face cam in this video because she is legit beautiful and it makes watching this dylan video bearable. otherwise i think i would be sick
you always have the same take on things as me. it s like you re speaking my mind!
new sub  so thank you for your enlightened perspective and gentleness.
contact me for your reward
yeah i legitimately get unnerved by this guy
it s the uncanny valley.
puke
so true couldn t say it better!
what are you talking about  dylan is great. you just got to normalize the bulge
and sport and stop taking our awards and get out if our prisons and domestic violence shelter. its mysogny
lol normalise the bulge
she still has more stuff there then my first appartement  wish i had a chair back then  guess i didn t have the privilege.....
she probably had to move because of the psycho stalker she had and hasn t finished furnishing it yet.
i wish my room was that empty. but i have to keep literally everything i own on one place.
dude moving especially on your own is so hard lol i don t blame her
good one  d
@roach  wasn t it a great feeling to get that first chair  though
@zxy atiywariii  my first chair was originally in a 76 pontiac i found it on the sidewalk. the perfect hight for the coffee table in front of the tv
he was most definitely groomed for his role in society. the world is so crazy right now...
it warms my heart to see a young woman like you who has her head on straight.
one thing for sure the new budweiser swimsuit calender will be nuts.
i have said dillin seems like a character invented to get a rise out of people.
ok... so i ve followed blaire white for a long time and was at one time watching a lot of the youtube beauty community  back in the days of tati westbrook  jeffree star  james charles  patrick starr  nikkie tutorials  nikita dragun  etc. when they  were the  reigning royalty  of the makeup and lgb community. because of those things  i think that i have a fair understanding about trans  lgb  drag folks and kinda what the process is for people with and without real gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia  including their transition stories.i d always felt like dylan wasn t really who or what he says he is  but after the facial feminization surgery  my spidey senses went crazy.every other person that i d seen go in for the ffs also had their breasts done at the same time  unless they couldn t afford it  but dylan didn t do it. that was a real head-scratcher for me. and we all know he can afford it. so  why not just go for it  he d also done a lot of complaining back before he claimed to be trans  that it really upset him that he had auditioned for several female roles in broadway shows  but would only get the male roles and he just couldn t understand why because he felt like he had the talent to pull off a female role. plus  when i first saw dylan on social media a year   a half ago or so  he was very proudly identifying as a gay man.then suddenly  out of the blue  he started making a big deal about being non-binary and just weeks later  he comes up with the days of girlhood schtick and says   hey guys  guess what ! i m trans! he basically went from a 20-something relatively successful gay actor on to being the biggest  trans celebrity  in the world in a matter of a month or two.there s a lot more that i could unpack  but this is already a small novel. loland as for oli london  i ve seen a few of his interviews and i don t know  but he s either a more committed actor than dylan  or he s legit.anyway... i think dylan is and always has been a total grifter or a psyop.
i wish i could upvote this several times  so true
spoken truth i believe you 100 . be safe my friend
he has to have some kinds of powerful connections to get all these brand sponsorships.  he must be a plant.  budweiser  nike  biden etc in the span of a year.  yeah.. that doesn t happen unless you have connections.
thank you thank you thank you for every time you referred to him as him.i keep flashing on kindergarten cop  the little girl that keeps saying   i m a fairy princess.
finally! thank you....you re so spot on.
this man finds women the quintessential beauty of the universei very never thought different women are a beacon that men are attracted tothe ones who claim being a queen are just lazy .no matter the day i am grateful to be able to wake up knowing i will see many of themthe petty stuff us just that pettyi love their warmth and their laughi love their passion or their serious side.most of all i just like looking at them i m sorry but pure beauty is hypnotizing.
stop giving him the time. and start boycotting in silence. we all need to use reverse psychology to be honest. these are distractions of something happening behind our back   look here not there  we all know this
i ve been wondering what s going on with the dylan stuff. it seems so strange that someone whom is  trans  or  pretend trans  or whatever who  besides being an actor  has little to no actual talent or credit to philantropy   or contributing to society  etc  is getting more publicity than any actual woman. it s so weird.
he s getting exactly what he aimed for! publicity beyond comprehension! it is stupefying!
i agree young lady. i ve wondered all along if that grifter was running one of the biggest scams we ve seen in a long time. if i m wrong  the guys going to need a ton of therapy in the near future. btw  i m probably more than twice your age  and understand how you feel about whether your vote counts   or not. i will say it s for sure it won t count if you don t vote. so  i ask you to please vote. we need more young people like you to help save this country.
i think you are totally right about him being planted.
thanks for your honesty  admitting you voted for mcain is almost as bad as me admitting i voted for bush 2000
it has to be intentional at this point. they want people to be pissed off.
thank you melonie for sticking up for christian beliefs and good morals. enjoy your content and hearing facts. thank you.
thank you riely i showed my kid what it take to stand up and say iam a women   sister  mother  wife and i am a proud
i would totally be down for her dating one of my oldest sons! she s the type of girl i hope they find.
it s scary to think that a woman having her head on straight isn t the norm!
@justsaltyme  that super sweet lol i love it
except for the body graffiti
total psyop
sold his soul to the devil
dark connections  beelzebub  baal    lucifer
dylan should be so proud he is  getting more attention as a woman than he will ever get as a man! this will follow him the rest of his life!
pretend trans feel like we are all caught up in some science fiction movie we didn t audition for.
big facts.
@lvthor ascending  why u aint donate  20 then
@2stroke tyson  i donated  50 today  i donate like almost every video lol  what you talking about  don t know how to find comment history  go away.
i agree  she is speaks the truth
decency is not a christian monopoly  but you do you.
@lordcommandernox  where did he imply that decency only comes from christians  did you miss the part where he said christian beliefs and good morals  clearly you can have good morals without being a christian otherwise he wouldn t have separated the two. please think before you speak
@hattorihanzo  on the topic of decency. maybe if you desisted from attempting to suggest i am wrong  or even unaware of what i meant  as if i was inept or incapable  i would be inclined to discuss whether or not i do believe christians have the high moral standards they purport to have  alas  you didn t and what i said stands. being decent does not occur from bible thumping.
i ve been asking this for a while. how is it the trans trend just suddenly popped up all safe and popular for corporations to push everywhere  from nowhere  it feels too planned  like some marketing agency partnered with some deep money to push trans as popular everywhere
i laughed inappropriately loud  while at work  at  z-cup titties .
this is the first video i ve seen of yours. you ma am just earned a sub. hell yeah.
stumbled upon your channel  you got a new subscriber
as one of my favorite podcasters often says  the difference between a conspiracy theory and the truth is about 6 to 9 months.
we need to consider the possibility that they caught him doing something very evil and now they have him doing this for his freedom.
you know that s an interesting point  maybe he s in fact a public figure in the making for a reason.  our culture certainly finds a way to push narratives.
i can t wait until normal people have enough of this insanity it has to be coming soon
whether or not this was decided in a smoke-filled room full of shadowy figures  the results are the same. the damage is done. but those memes tho! the memes are priceless.
you want dylan to go away  just ignore everything they do with him. don t buy anything with his face on the product. just like hollywood movies have tanked because no one is watching. it s the same with everything else. it doesn t work if no one is watching and reacting. the power is in our hands when we just don t react and don t purchase. it s really that simple
this is just another salvo in the constant barrage on our sanity. there is no way this person appears out of nowhere  being a clown  and gets as far as they do in such a short period of time.
dylan helped make and star in  the book of mormon with the creators of south park  matt and trey. not sure if that makes a difference but should definitely be noted.
love it-love it!!-love ittt!!!!keep it up!! you go   real  girl!!
wisdom beyond your years. i agree with everything you said.
i think you are right about him being a plant and i think it started when he went on wheel of fortune. i think that was the beginning of the dylan democrat plan.
lol what if one day he just came out and said it was all bs
i ve been  trans  for 50  years and melonie is so right. i ve never been in a woman s space and never will. oh  and there s no such thing as trans.i can t stress enough how important it is for women to have spaces exclusively for them. this was understood by our grandparents. for back in those days there were women s only carriages on trains  waiting rooms on the platform marked for women only  separate women s wards in hospital and times at the swimming baths that were solely for women. the victorians and edwardians knew the value of separating the sexes for the protection of women. how sad and tragic that this form of safeguarding no longer applies.
i love how we are celebrating schizophrenia when we should be treating it
you notice everything that puts dylan s face on it goes bankrupt or sees a mass loss in sales right after
first off   the guy looks just like smiling bob from the early viagra commercials   which in and of itself is frightening.   but the question of his being a planted shill for evil   once asked aloud seems obvious.   as the truth often is.  i am grateful for your pointing this out.   he is vividly unnervingly obscene.
@lordcommandernox  it doesn t matter what you meant since you completely misunderstood the persons comment and i corrected you on it which you obviously didn t like. me not automatically wanting to have a discussion with someone as irrational as yourself doesn t automatically mean your comment still stands. you obviously do not like christianity and i get that but when you saw morals and christianity next to each other your feelings got in the way of any bit of rational thinking and you completely read the comment in the way you wanted to. why would i have a discussion with someone like that
@hattorihanzo  because you re predictable and obviously replied attempting to maybe this time get past the carapace of my utter indifference  and it only worked to the extent that i allowed it to  do not mistake my intentions  i do not  dislike  christianity  as you put it  i find it comedical
@hattorihanzo  any answer you solicit will be beyond the scope of my inicial statement  which still stands despite your contortionism. it s nice that christians love to paint themselves as community beacons  go ahead  i m no stopping you.
@hattorihanzo  being decent is not a christian monopoly. take that as thou will.
@hattorihanzo  don t get me started on the christian chicks i ve dated
knowles
it actually goes  the difference between a conspiracy theory and a conspiracy fact is about 6 months ... not far off lol.
are you a man
thank you molly  wonderful post!
@whatahorriblenight  yes  and always have been.
why is he right
this is how i can tell im not phobic anything. you are who you are while being fair enough to women and children. that is perfectly fine. but when you wanna get into rr and showers with women and mess with kids  that s the only time i feel upset or hate.
all this is in a big part on men  sadly demonstrates how they are unwilling to protect women  when all they argue is traditional roles
huzzah. and individual with some common sense. thank you for this
@brent robles  how is this common sense
no one cares what adults do.  leave the kids alone!
my take is if you can t get your point across one way  try another. in other words  don t buy the products they support   the movies they promote and so on. that will make a big difference. when the woke go broke then you will see a shift in companies. companies can t afford to lose money. that is where you hit them where it hurts without saying much at all. i just don t buy in these markets anymore. gives me piece of mind knowing i don t add to their game.
this will not end well.i can t believe we are here.
makes so much sense! we all need to stop giving him any attention and not talk about him and they lose. this is all a bizarre time right now.
nike and ab are gonna feel this mistake in their bottom line for months to come.
he is a phenomenal actor tho.
i think it s a complete act and he s taking these companies endorsing him for a ride whilst mocking every woman in existence
my sister in christ  i m glad i found this channel. god bless you
the freakfringe doesnt out number us. they out power and out influence us. baffles me to no end.
dylan is a male performance artist. it s a parody  he s pretending to self identify as a 12 year old girl on a shopping spree
the more she talks the hotter she gets. thank you lord for girls like melonie.
you are speaking wisdom and insight! deliver us from this complete nonsense.
just found you subbed already love this channel
now the horrible question is would the elite unalive him for the cause.
it s kind of funny that rupaul  never had a deal like that and he was kinda the first person who had dual roles and is way cooler than dylan.
i really get the feeling dylan is a comedian who is making fun of all this but accidentally got in too deep.  i am 99  sure this person is more of a troll than a psyop.  companies can t tell them apart because they have no souls and they are just pandering.  so dylan is taking the cash.  smart move.
wow. i never even thought about that but you re probably 100  correct on her being a plant. seeing how all the brands are starting to use it. i wouldn t doubt it for a second
when you said prosthetic titties  i laughed so hard. who are you  i love your rhetoric.
melanie i m so tired of this crap with trans fools. did you see the story of riley gaines. shes a female swimmer. any way she was speaking at a college about leah thomas who is a male. she was punched 2  s but a man in a dress. thank you melonie. your spot on with your thoughts
if you look at him as a comedian actor he is hilarious. like benny hill.
ok. i am a sanitation worker  garbage man  living in nyc. and i can promise  the vast majority of guys that would call out  if they recognized dylan  would be wanting to confirm it was him to make fun of him with his partner the guys back at the garage. there are exceptions  but most of the sanitation men i ve met in my time so far are right leaning and do not enjoy the trans stuff going on
are yall as confused as i am
@ houston texans   i was but not anymore after checking out his page!congratulations to him
i did my sociology term paper on transgender  back in the 80s as i was working towards a career in le and being in a major city i thought it was important to understand people from all walks of life. yes there is transgenderism  transsexuals. then there is the transvestite. all different biological causes and consequences. what we re seeing here and now is total exploitation and corruption of a physiological  and for lack of a better description  birth anomaly  or defect. these people like dylan should be ashamed of the disservice they re doing to bona-fide transgender people of the world and may they be tried and convicted of crimes against humanity for  interference with children. it s an abomination.
so you re a transvestite  not transgender. like rupauls drag queens  transvestites. correct
@leslie gums  what crime did dylan commit
@supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  he didn t say he committed a crime  dylan ...he said those interfering with children s innocence should be tried and convicted.  when did it become a good thing to take elementary school aged children to drag shows   only groomers would partake in  or condone  such things...
@violet mushroom  no. this is on women. period. but per usual  zero accountability.
my thing is i just don t understand why being a trans woman is so bad. why insist your a woman. the fact that a trans person took the steps to be comfortable in their own body should be celebrated. the same way a biological woman should be celebrated for her unique struggles. why can t we co-exist within our own beauty.
dylan is not a woman and he knows it... he is an actor  nothing more. do research..his past want to be hollywood career and acting in general was in the toilet. then he became more popular by doing gay acting. then he found a new niche .... acting like a woman as a fake trans.he constantly mocks women at the same time gets millions of dollars. interesting fact  he refuses to get bottom surgery... i wonder why
@molly cutpurse  see  this is exactly why i only respect older trans people. i never had any issue with the trans community until now.i am hindu and we believe in 3 genders. the third gender is considered as a separate gender from men and women. they have their own community and they have never claimed to be  women  nor did they ever bother to enter women s spaces. they are proud of their uniqueness and accept the differences. they respect women and understand that they are not women. and everyone else respects the third gender  - their presence is considered auspicious and hence they are invited to celebrate happy occasions. this is why i ah w always been accepting to trans community. but not anymore. the west has made a mockery of everything.
@m  thank you  m for educating me. i know a little about hindu customs but not a great deal. thank you for your support.
thank you for being one of the few who actually has respect for us women.
i m sorry you suffer from gender dysphoria  i understand it s not something you can do too much about  and there might be coping mechanisms like exercise but it s always gonna be underlying because of endocrinology and stuff.  take care of yourself and stay true to yourself and to the world  the truth will empower you and set you free  it is not there to hurt you.  it s there to warn you and protect you.male only spaces are important too  especially for young men  so we can protect each other from  virtuous lies  and grill one another about male issues and masculinity.
exactly. ignore him and he ll self immolate.
@petey wheatstraws  i hope so! i am thankful for this video though  it makes sense to me if he s hired for this stuff. it s so creepy
like a metthh user he fell into a trap
that s the feeling i got the first time.
definitely started as a parody.
mulvaney has to be all in as he s become a key ally in the trans cult s plan to normalize being trans is cool  gender is fluid and men can become women and women can become men like a costume!  the trade off with scoring huge endorsement deals  becoming an influencer and meeting famous people is a planned transition to be done over time.
maybe  maybe not. no one knows for sure.
@slowdiver  he actually admitted it was
this is the one
even if he s a real person grifter his persona is the result of a psyop
him.
exactly he af
i m so glad i m finding someone discussing this. i ve been thinking this over the past week or 2. what brought me to this conclusion was the fact that the daily wire  who are supposedly against all this shit  will not stop talking about this dude!!! they act like dylan is repulsive but then proceed to have all over their spokes ppl talk about him every freaking day.. and it s wild to me how the daily wire doesn t realize that their giving dylan exaclty what he wants  and considering how that literally makes no sense for the daily wire to do  it seems to me that he s clearly being forced on us for a reason and it s not simply some organic rise to fame  as if any rise to fame is actually organic but that s a topic for another day . beside the fact that  all press is bad press  and. bitching about mulvaney prob gets them shit tons of traffic  sure. but this is directly against what they seem to stand for .  glad to find your channel!
dylan s in the matrix eating his favorite steak
the bud thing is tied to mandatory esg scoring  every company will be doing this woke stuff within 2 years or lose they re access to banking.
of course he s got a damn production team and camera operators following him around. it s the subversion of the youth.
i m glad to find someone else who has the same suspicion.  he s rising too fast. where does the money trail lead
dylan needs to be in a institution
it honestly makes me sad  being the guy who was criticized for saying all of this years ago. the  slippery slope fallacy  was said as a mockery and used as an insult. now seeing how deeply and terribly it is affecting society. i just wish people would have listened. there are those of us giving warnings about more things that are happening now as well. i only hope society hears them and listens this time.
probably the most accurate thing i ve heard.
remember you can t trade facts for feelings and expect conformance. it doesn t end well
my first time stumbling upon your videos  love your point of view.
he is a very sick  confused little man . but he has developed some skills in bankrupting some alcohol beverage companies.
that crazy smile when he s working out...    l m a o
dylan is satan s greatest achievement
you really are just the cutest thing sweetie. have a great day! thanks for speaking out
you re not crazy. it absolutely makes perfect sense.
my thoughts from the begining.good job calling it out.cause i think you called it for what it is.awsome girl.
i wonder what brandon did with him her  at minimum sniffed its hair ..seeing ashly his little girl had to change her shower habits so daddy would not shower with her.  inappropriate  as ashly called it
all it takes to be woman of the year  is to be one for a year
noone gets this prominent this quickly without ulterior motive and handlers behind them.
dylan is an actor. he is acting. and he is making a ton of money  this is his most successful gig.
well  ya know... the daily wire
yea i have my doubts about the daily wire and ben shapiro.
the daily wire knows exactly what they re doing.
i don t agree that the daily wire shining light on this madness  goes against what they stand for
any publicity is good publicity.
i feel you.  it s so frustrating
satan stopped having to do any real work after we left the garden.
great content melonie  never stop exposing them!how  bout them steelers!
psyop is giving too much credit  it s a grift. dylan has made some serious dosh in the last year. definitely has management running their act.
thank you for speaking out!
im of the same mindset 100 ! ive said it before that it s all a performance  he s a caricature and insulting to women. i just remember when he said all his mom wanted was him to own property in cali. it s a good time to make some    !
if the the taste of budweiser hasn t made you sick yet   seeing dylan s face on a gross beer can surely will!
a spiritual war going on indeed  too bad people don t believe it unless they see it. if you pay attention though it s pretty obvious to people like us. great video once again melonie  the more you involve the word in these videos the more blessed you re going to be! have a wonderful day
bring back the times when businesses just wanted to sell their overpriced products instead of forcing woke shyte on people!
i think tim pool s take is spot on for dylan. he was making a bunch of  gay videos  then searching for the next trend to hit the algorithm. once he came out as  trans  his video started getting 6x the views.
we re stuck in a real life episode from the 1980 1982  bosom buddies  tv series starring tom hanks and peter scolari
i believe this is where we are now in time and space. society has been on the downturn for several years now. it s a shame and a disgrace what it has become.
wow-  initially i was about to disagree but as you spoke your idea started to make more sense to me.  a plant explains it.  this guy is insulting women hood   but i m glad women are speaking up because men get called cancel-names speaking on this craziness.  i stand with females in resistance to this new definition of what a woman is.
hey  melonie  about yesterday s video... i just wanted to say i m so glad you posted it. i d say that video deserves a spot in your top 10 best i know you got pushback on it  but don t let that dissuade you. speaking out on this issue is so crucial. there are studies that show children who fall prey to transgender medical procedures are at risk of dangerous health risks including but not limited to  high blood pressure  blood clots  stroke and cancer. they re damaging kids to further a depraved ideology that puts them in rebellion with god and biology. as you said  though some want to scoff at the use of the term... it s demonic. it s sacrificing our children on an altar not too dissimilar to baal. we re teaching kids to hate who they biologically are  and they re then led to believe that happiness and an end to their dysphoria lies in surgeries that will ultimately make them unrecognizable. it s a decision that can never be truly reversed and encouraging young children- who lack the mental foresight to understand the long term impact this will have on their mental and biological development- to make such a choice is incredibly dangerous. people try to twist the issue and blame christians for what people like audrey hale did because christians supposedly  hate  transgenders... but christians weren t the ones who whispered lies to her that surgery and going against biology was the answer  and then pumped her body full of a level of hormones that  by god s design  her body was not physically built to handle.walt heyer notes that those who undergo the gender reassignment surgery are many times more likely to commit suicide than the general population   41-50  of the transgender population will attempt suicide .the surgery never can address the psychological and emotional issues that transgenders suffer from with their identity it can t do it because they re depressed. you can t cure depression with cutting off body parts or adding body parts or changing a body configuration. the real hatred comes from those who accept the transgender movement  not those who speak out against it. it takes a lot of hate to be okay with people  especially children  screwing up their bodies and in turn risking an increased susceptibility toward suicide because the lies and whispers they were told about surgery and cross-sex hormones did not give them the results they thought they wanted.what s more  laura perry  a transgender turned christian  has this to say   i just want to encourage people to speak the truth in love even though it may be met with a lot of resistance. if you had spoken the truth in love to me back then  i probably would have bit your head off verbally. but truth is so powerful even when it makes somebody angry.i think we ve had the idea in this culture  that because christianity was accepted for so long  people are going to love our message.jesus told us we would be hated. so  love people enough to be willing for them to be mad at you   be willing to be hated because you never know what that seed of truth is going to do. jesus said you will know the truth  and the truth will set you free. that s ultimately what set me free. so  melonie... don t let anyone deter you from what you re doing. you may be planting more seeds than you realize  people may insult or ridicule you  but all they re really trying to do is intimidate you into being silent. they don t want to hear the truth about the physical and spiritual dangers of trans ideology. the truth stings. but jesus is the spiritual antiseptic that we  as believers  mustn t withhold from anyone. only in him can the contentment that the human heart desperately seeks be found since he s the author of the human heart.and just know  despite any insults or mockery you may receive... there are people like me who absolutely stand by you and think you re sagaciously savvy  hilarious  heartfelt  sharp as a whip and absolutely stellar. god bless you so much  melonie
dylan isn t  annoying   he s spreading sickness. don t downplay the social contagion at work.
if the teacher was a troll he shouldn t be attending a young girls events with their moms telling him to leave.
well he has done well for himself....i can choose to notice him or not
i think the evidence that mulvaney is all an act is that you ll notice that he doesn t generally engage in the angry  wokescoldery  nonsense. he s always upbeat  he s always putting on a happy face and responds to criticism with positivity. there s no way he actually believes this crap or he d be lashing out at every hint of criticism with angry  self righteous posturing  finger pointing and name calling.  the people that genuinely believe this gender nonsense are way too psychologically damaged to be able to fake positivity as much as he does  he s psychologically damaged  but not in the same way as most trans people ... see the  it s ma am  guy as an example . this general positivity is also why his act is very smartly crafted  because he ll do way more to win people over to this satanism with a smile and a giggle than all the  use my made up pronouns or you re a bigot!  nonsense from most trannies.
this bloke needs to seek help   shame on the companies using him  this will backfire big time
it s crazy how society is enabling this behavior when there are more deserving people out there
i m here for this. just subbed  satan and the demons are running amok. for sure. good always wins.
mulvany is like a madonna of the 2020 s . same driving ambition.
amen! thank you so much and god bless!
@melonie mac go boom  always a pleasure!
it s been for a few decades...
thank you so much  this means a lot. god bless you
you said it well sir  glad to see real ones sticking to it as well in the comments.
@marilyn beatrice buzogany  more than you gave marilyn
@melonie mac go boom   110 . i wish zogtube didn t take a cut  would help if i could. oh  and everything is a psyop right now  the cbdc and restrict acts are coming. the founders would want us to do what they did. we need to organize  because that was how they defeated and isolated the moderates and loyalists. now. best always
@stalinlovsfbiciafakemsmzio2708 that s what all the division is for. they have everyone at each other throats to the point of no one being able to see the bigger picture. united we stand  divided we fall.
transition for minor children is different than an adult s transition. it is primarily social- preferred name and pronouns  hair  clothing  and the like. as puberty nears  the child s physician may recommend puberty blockers- medications that have been in common use for other conditions for many  many years  whose efficacy and safety are well documented. these medications are not  hormone therapy   they do not cause any changes. instead  they delay the onset of any changes puberty might cause  breast development  voice deepening  etc . if these medications were to be stopped  the child s body would progress into puberty naturally.no physician will perform gender confirming surgery on a pre-pubescent child  and in almost all cases will wait until the child is 17 18 before agreeing to perform any of these procedures. hormone therapy would start in late teens  so they d not be a  child  anymore but a young adult.puberty blocker prescriptions are not written by a physician on a whim  there must be documented evidence that the child s gender identity is insistent  consistent  and persistent. there is a medical protocol that is followed as per wpath.given all this  there is exceedingly little risk of harm to the child in allowing them to socially transition. trans children  like trans adults  show marked positive emotional improvement when their gender identities are supported.anti-transgender activists are neither well informed  or capable of helping these transgender teens in any way. their alternative treatment  conversion therapy  has no track record for helping these kids  and there are no successful conversion therapy programs. in a steadily increasing number of jurisdictions  conversion therapy is against the law.if you are a parent and do not support your transgender child  you are objectively a bad parent. yes  not accepting them for who they are is dangerous. lgbtq youth who report having at least one accepting adult were 40  less likely to report a suicide attempt. the reason why suicidal rates are so high is because transgender individuals are being oppressed by a group of people who reject their gender identity expression.
@brother johnny  wrong
dude is absolutely insane
brave womenstay strong!!!!
melonie  as a goof if you transitioned you d be jimmy neutron. your wide hand gestural expressions and tone of voice when you get exited hits that right feminine alto masculine falsetto pitch.
there was once a middle aged comedian who played a child-minded character who had his face on everything that could be marketed back in the day.his name was paul reubens. dylan is that  but without the talent.
i pity him  but not because  of his little sad episodes. i pity him because he s pitiful.
i think you re almost all the way right. 1. mulvaney possibly a plant  but he don t know it. he thinks he s famous by himself  when the influence comes from covert financiers. 2. it s the drag trans movement that is the psyop. mulvaney is just one cog in the machine. 3. 2 investment firms own everything in the world. as consumers  we believe there is competition when there isn t. the same 10 people sell us all the shit we could think of buying. 4. when you understand that the same men that own pepsi also own coke  and those same people own the media  than i fail to understand how we think we have free choice in anything. 5. tech top tip  everything that s sensationalized is a psyop to direct our behaviour. the reason is an impending economical collapse. the west is going to see a banking crisis and the distractions keep people engaged in stupid shit rather than concentrate on how to prepare or learn who to vote for to cushion the fall.
ever wonder how his parents feel
look at boys feet  i laugh every time someone puts out a video of him doing whatever he s doing
dylan is a cutting edge design emulated by the secret underground obscure left group that have control over the entire wokness mouvement.
the problem is we can t be reasonable with people who are unreasonable.
i gotta say  though  this totally tracks with all the jokes and snide remarks we used to make about light beer drinkers back in the day.
facts melanie. facts! you cooked in this video.
i seriously doubt if a garbage man leaned out of the truck and said   hi dylan   he is trying to make it sound like the common man recognizes him and likes him.
as a women  i follow a lot of funny men on youtube that do real parody s of women and i laugh all day long. it s funny and always has been funny for men to dress and act funny. no joke . when i first say dylan in  her  hiking heels  .. i laughed because i thought it was a dude just being funny and making fun of prissy ticktock girls in the woods. to be honest i still think i may be correct
he is definitely playing a part. he is getting paid well.he is playing so many people for fools
i m like you  i used to be more libertarian..but ive seen how  live and let live  doesn t work if the other side isn t content with that and constantly pushes until you bend the knee.
he was a broadway person doing bom.  a southpark production.  while southpark old humor is now our reality.  100  dilly is a plant  groomed and bred for this very thing.    everyone else has done a good job pointing it out.  no need to repeat them.
love ya  is the most vapid sentiment ever uttered.
i would have to agree with you. there are so many confused people who don t get the push. dudes way over the top.
my thought is choosing him as a spokesperson appears to be corporate suicide  knowing their customer base so  .who is paying them off or subsidizing the bottom line
except that paul reubens was drastically different from peewee herman.
@david franz  paul reubens is extremely talented and it always seemed weird that the cops had nothing better to do than look for something wrong in an  adult  theater.
@david franz  and you think dylan roams around his yard doing jumping jacks in a sports bra and hamming it up in front of no one
i wonder what michael jackson s opinion on dylan would be
@hank hill homeowner  michael probably wouldn t waste his time. at 60-somethjng he probably wouldn t even know who dylan is.
@batboy999  michael was very world conscious  i m sure he would be up to date on such things.
talking about michael mcdonald as stuart on mad tv
dylan actually is talented as well. before this  he was on broadway!! definitely a plant.
yeah i think he s just trying to be pee wee
@lana zak  this. if you ask anyone that worked an adult movie  house or the backroom of adult store where you can preview movies they will yell you all about the clean up and the stench that lingers. they just wanted something to bust that night.
@wendyokoopa7048 bust.. lmao considering the subject  that s hilarious choice of wording.
paul reubens is the first actor ive ever seen  cancelled  in my lifetime. and honestly he did nothing wrong. he was in a dark adult theatre by himself and one of the ushers with a flashlight caught him doing  stuff .  ridiculous that he pretty much lost all acting roles for 20 years afterwards. even before he played peewee herman  he was in cheech and chong movies playing a cocaine addict drug dealer and he was hilarious in it!  his  image  never even started out as family friendly.
@wegotit  classic
excellent comment
you cant reason with evil
same here. it seems it that there are always humans who will push boundaries no matter how free a society is. truly sad
hope their stockholders dump their holdings.
mulvaney being a psy-op .... never thought of that one before. good point. i think you are on to something. isn t that fascinating... another psy-op  probably. when will people come together and stop this crap ... how much more will it take  ... damn.
he most definitely is a pysopwhy tf is he in so many commercials
there s no single answer to this gender bender problem in my opinion. i do think that  as you mentioned  modern feminism has contributed to this. male bashing has been a staple of the feminist movement. maybe as a child  someone like mulvaney was exposed to women and the media who habitually disparaged men and it affected him. heck idk.
glowies  how psy do you want your op china  yes.
the best thing about the mulvaney cosplay  is that he s just doing a variation of what girls do to ruin the fun boys  men have in life. i also think it s plausible to suggest that the  metoo movement led to this  as return swing of the pendulum  also definitely benefits the  sex  trafficking industry of  hollywood and beyond.
he is as good a representation of actual trans people as he is for    actual    women
i ve been saying this since day 1 of being a woman
this entire nation is a psyop. nearly everything we are told is a lie to bring about our demise  and so far  theyve succeeded immensely.
cosplays as a woman is an amazing way of saying it
this world today is why i miss the 80 s so damn much. life was normal back then without the bs internet crap.
you are spot on  please wake up people!!!
you make so much sense. i never thought about it that way. he was planted.
dylan also had shown some facial hair along the jawline in that ticktok
the trash man  knew  dylan  because he s an expert on dealing with trash. in reality  dylan was probably in the road   the guy was telling him to get the hell out of the way.
part of the programming that s trying to get us ready for trans-humanism  not just trans-genderism!
remember  5th element    he s playing a role that has a purpose .one contrary to good order .
posting before watching .i thought this was a psyop from the beginning.  tiktok is such an attractive a platform for these kinds of operations.
oh  i agree. i would not put it passed the ellits to plant certain ppl out in the public to force their own agenda down the throat of everyday citizens.
ironically  he played elder white in the b way play  the book of mormon  pre-pandemic.
continue to put your money where your heart is  not just with melonie but companies  orgs  and other people you believe in! thanks mm!
perhaps he sold his soul.
@chicken little syndrome  whatcha for the signs.
this.
probably
i work for coors.  we have been told that we are on mandatory overtime  until further notice.   thanks bud.
he is a walking meme. look at the ridiculously exaggerated facial expressions. even for drag queens  he is overboard in how he exaggerates. being an actor would certainly make sense.
go out to daily mail online. the picture of him with the 5 oclock shadow bringing his garbage cans up from the street speaks volumes.
i can only stomach dylan in very short bursts.
i agree with you. good insight
i ve been saying he s an actor playing a part for the money for a long time. however  it never occurred to me that he might be planted. i think you might be onto something!the fallout when he s finally exposed is going to be marvelous
if anyone woman acted the way dylan does people would say she was insane and in need of help.  but since it s a  man  its treated as perfectly normal.
it s sad that only the good die young! peace out.
exactly my thought. especially when he was talking like there s a threat to people of they don t accept the movement.  the government is totally involved.i spoke out the other day and was wildly attacked.  i don t care because i just came back with truth.
this guy s elevation to protected status is exactly why riley gaines was kidnapped and assaulted!
my first thought he was thrown in there to upset or off balance or even to divide
the best way to get back at people who dance around demanding your attention is to ignore them. simply walk away from them  tune them out. it s the ultimate insult  and it drives them crazy.
when you say it like that  he looks like an actor having insane fun.
in response to the downturn in sales of bud light  the manufacturers are rebranding the beer as  butt rite ...
you are a smart lady and 100  correct. thanks from another woman.
you re spot on hunnie
this is  why we all need to vote. if we all stand together  we  may be able to over welm there trick.
they actually were women who acted like that and they were the flavor of the month  or more accurately  week  and they went away.the prancer-cise woman  the tampon-earing feminist activists  the laughter yoga teacher  star wars mom and other viral sensations - they all came and went. dylan is still topping the charts  getting big money deals for over a year and little to no slowing down.something else is clearly at play.
i think your right about about a plant but he also just happens to be the right wack job at the right time ....
btw  how did dylan know that the supposed  garbage man  @5 38 was indeed a  man   doesn t that pretty much contradict his entire schtick
exactly  that s what i keep saying.  do your best to look away and move on.
distraction to keep us focused on  it  rather then seeing and preparing for what is really  happening..
this stuff is off the rails.
one can only hope  he she will one day come out and say psych gotcha!
he s definitely planted. just like all these other random entertainers  singers  and whoever that pop up out of nowhere nowadays.
i think dylan would be a good addition to  the jersey shore  he and snorkle could pal around !
i m not sure seeing as he s been trying every algorithmic buzzword identity to get famous since their online debut.doesn t mean it can t be true  but the narcissism is real for the individual regardless.
dylan watched the julie andrew s movie called victor victoria.... and a light bulb went off!
can t blame dylan for getting wealthy!
do what you do best take his life and see how much he was acting like a girl before all of this happen but you re right now they ll be people out there that have known him for a long time they ll let you know but do what you do best dig into his life digging into his background unmask the fraud
you can t just blame him. the people who watch and encourage him. it s sad and disturbing.. hope he can handle it when they decide they re done with him..
he was in a successful broadway show so i m not disputing your theory but he could have had a decent career. obviously not as lucrative as fast as this has been
i am 56 years old and have had many relationships with women in my life. 2 ex wives  3 daughters  3 sisters and several casual girlfriends.i have never seen any of these women in my life behave like this dude does.it s almost as if he is making fun of women or perhaps has a misogynistic hangup towards women in general.if i were a woman  i would be completely offended by this belittling behavior.
as soon as they re done using him  then he s on his butt.
shit like dylan make me think ai already runs the world.
he was on the price is right years back.
you better vote  girl! every vote matters when they re trying their best to destroy the country.
you are a beautiful christian woman! wish there were more like you. seems rather rare nowadays.
this is a deadnaming speed run and i m here for it.love the video. women need to stand up to this nonsense before they re erased from society.
yup  that s i never gave any money or time to the poo music industry. it s all artificial talent
with any fast rise there is a tipping point! i cannot wait to see what the fall will be like  what truths will be revealed then  it will be juicy i can feel it!!!
third act in his story is a stint in rehab where he ll be celebrated for his courageous battle with substance abuse and possibly his  journey  back to being a guy. he can milk this for a while yet.
for years there s also been a lot of these men posing as women influencers right here on you tube teaching real woman to paint their faces like drag queens.
if that happens knowing how they do things he may end up with health failures or some other tragic accident
he is a creature of the allmighty social media algorithm. tim pool outlined that dylan actually started as a gay man on facebook and it didnt take of. he tried something different and it also didn t work. then he hit the motherlode that is trans humanism and the algorithm elevated him into his current heights. give it a bit and he crashes like icarus. this always happens
@creepy clips  thanks. i check it out
@athrun82  that doesn t explain why he s so heavily promoted by the us government and large corporations.
the fact that he hasn t changed his name just shows that he is only out for fame. his entire history on social media he s been trying to find ways to go viral. because of his ego  he will probably never change his name. which only proves that he is not trans. to me that makes him even more sick.
i  believe you hit the nail on the head. that has been my thoughts and feelings from the beginning of this dylan malvani movement.  and maybe  just maybe it is happening to wake up these passive women and men who are allowing these transgenders to enter into our spaces and take a stand against this mess.
this doesn t stop until real women make it stop. as soon as you step up ladies every real man will back you. balls in your court. gl.
i m sure dylan knows in his heart that no straight man would ever date him. the only man that would be attracted to him are attracted to other men as well
genius!liked and subbed.
dylan mulvany is living proof that men still rule!
his friend jeffrey marsh is weird too
i applaud a real woman like you calling out absurdities in this world ! keep up the great work.
dylan has about as much interest in becoming a woman as i have in becoming a man zero zip none! he s not transitioning nothing but his attitude
bud light gives pounding a tall boy after work a whole new meaning
i m sick of him. we  need to make him go away
i think you re onto something. great vid
people will use your weakness against you. for the most part. people that are conservative are also extremely caring individuals. if you turn off the audio and just read his face he doesn t look sad or upset. it looks fake. a bad actor. now. why would he be acting like he said to pull on our heartstrings and make us continue to buy something we don t want to buy. it s okay for these companies to do this and make their loyal fan base upset because they know that they come up with a sad story. we ll feel bad and we ll start buying their stuff again.
yes  well said! it s more than just this one ad. this agenda is changing school curriculums across the world  and being promoted by many gov ts simultaneously as a global effort. books  job adverts  commercial ads  curriculums  health service training  human resources company training  public toilets - all these things being changed in many countries at the same time is more than a silly trend - it s an agenda.
i like the way you think  assume everything is planned.
i think this is a kind of zoo culture. i mean a squirrel in the zoo gets 100x attention plus earns money as opposed to a regular squirrel in the forest
wow now this host of s a woman you deserve woman of the year girl i m celebrating you being a woman where you at for this woman nike budlight  bet you wish you had sponsored this woman instead of a fake
his parents must be really proud ffs!!
i don t know what it is! but what i do know is  this creature is all over my timeline. literally channels i ve never heard of!just video after video about this thing!  today i m a woman! actually a little girl! creepy  af
keep track of which media and which companies agree to celebrate the trans agenda. it s important to keep records of this yourself--once the transitioned victims are no longer of political use  all their present supporters will say they were against it from the start--records will disappear  and video of it will be hard to find
simp alert
dylan was created by ai.
the greatest evil is taking the innocence from children. i really don t care what they do as adults  until they involve children in their ideology  which they have  as an integral part.
totally agreed!!!
you are 100  on target. nothing about him is organic.
i just found you today. subscribed
as a pittsburgh native  loving all the steelers gear! love the videos  we gotta push back on this nonsense  it is almost fully acceptable in society to do this crap. its only going to get worse.
sloppy joe wants a go at smelling his hair again and again after he takes his blue pill of course
you nailed it
yes he is an act and it s for bringing out all the freaks! prudent planning
new nick name for the canadian shop teacher - zz  top
honestly it s the ppl in this world that support this bs who i m shocked about and disappointed with.  the ppl who are so gullible and weak that they follow these weirdos and can t see through the facade.  it s just unbelievable ppl can be so blind and dumb as they are.  they remind me of the mindless followers in movies like mad max  or wicker man  the village etc.  it s really terrifying to know there are tons of ppl who think that this is ok.  whether or not there s more of us rational minded ppl than the woke  it s still enough that they re making an everlasting impact on our future and affecting our children  our society  our sports  companies  politics etc.  and you know the crazy are relentless  they are insane!  we do have to fight back and i think it s going to be a long and excruciating fight but we can t let them wipe out biological women cuz it seems to be what they re out to do!
he s scary. inside and out. if i saw him on the streets with my kids i would literally cover their eyes. if he creeps me out i don t want to know how kids would react to him
has anyone else noticed that dylan seems to be alone in most of these videos.  must be a lonely life he is leading.  is the money worth it to be all alone in the world   pretty sad to be honest.
i m almost convinced he s doing an andy kaufman troll.
when did you transition melonie  and do you ever think of detransitioning
my question is with all the money he s making right now  when is he getting the surgery  if he s still claims it s cost prohibitive  maybe we should do a fundraiser.that can only be released to pay for the surgery upon completion. that would let us know where he stands because a lot of people are cynical of this guy regardless of their take on transgenderism.
i suspect dylan is loving all this attention and money. just take no notice  stop buying the products if you are offended.  i couldn never fit into nike clothes anyway  i don t drink and i m too old to need tampax.
based on the history of his attempts at fame i think it is more likely the  powers that be  are leaning into it and taking advantage rather than being a plant in the first place. either way though it is incredibly bizarre.
minimalist room is great  i need to remove some things too. there s blame on both sides and adults aren t acting the way they should. there is no proper respect  no responsibility  no listening skills  no common sense to warrant any sort of solution. the fact of the matter is that western society and its values are basically in the negative and no one wants to bring it back to positive. the whole idea of inclusivity to prevent sucide rates increasing is concerning because people only solution seems to be ending it all before trying.
i heard dylan say he was trying to get closer to god...he needs prayer to accept the truth and start living it. i agree we are in a war of good and evil not flesh and blood. we are fed the devils work and not god s miracles. to make us give up....our lord and savior has not left us and he is working his miracles! lift dylan up in your prayers!
he s so creepy!
kids are being groomed to like these people. crazy world we live in.
attempt at fame  i would sy he is pretty darn famous with how many continue to talk about him constantly  and know who he is.
@jori diculous  i think they are talking about in the past   not current time.
@tony g  yea like when he was on price is right   danced for what felt like 3 minutes straight.
@tony g  well yeah  you aint famous until you are  p
i think these companies are being paid to push the issue.
the world gets crazier by the day
agreed and subbed
if melonie and dylan entered a beauty pageant  my vote would go to melonie in a heart beat lmao.
the real women voice is just like his
question    if he is celebrating 365 days as a woman   doesn t that sort of blow the whole  born this way  narrative out of the water
i ve been saying that. he is not taking hormones and he obviously isn t getting bottom surgery. he would be a eunuch. makes you wonder why they are pushing this on children..
budweiser wanted someone that would appeal to both men and women  but selected someone who is an insult to both.
it s all about distracting us from looking up at our skies and discussing it.
i agree. he s playing the biggest role of his life for fame and fortune and shock value.
great take!  thank you!
0 56 when i subbed to you a week ago  i had no idea you were a sister in christ  awesome stuff
totally smoke and mirrors keeps people distracted it worked well
dylan is a actor! she s very entertaining and makes me laugh!people getting mad at this person has nothing better to do! live and let live!
yes i believe he is.
he will never be able to truly publicize what is bothering him but i guarantee that even though he s surrounded by smiley glad hands and he has cases of free beer and nike swag  those things do not love him. truly deep down dylan wants the same thing we all want food shelter and love
no. i don t believe dylan is actually trying to medically transition. matter of fact  he ll probably ride the de-transition train too..
interesting point! go stillers!
psyopbut fun to laugh at.
the most disturbing part is the amount of women who support this bs. while vilifying anyone who dares to call this nonsense out as being insane behavior. they are literally supporting those who are openly mocking  canceling  bullying  disrespecting and destroying them  what a woman is and women in general. i guess the old adage is right   you can t fix stupid.
you seem to be the kind of person who d call me weird for collecting and cartographing invertebrates that live in my county
i would not call you anything live and let live
everybody relax  the only reason bud light made an ad with dylan mulvaney is because dermott mulroney had already put a wig on and booked with coors! ha ha  yip yip yippeeeeeee!!!
dude takes method acting to another level.
it s amazing what you miss when you don t watch tv or commercials. giving up television 20 years ago was easier than i thought  focus on movies and video games  and  if  there was ever a show  worth  checking out - well - the internet is an endless supply of opportunity. youtube helps me keep caught up on somethings - both good and baaaaaaad!oh  mulvaney  catamite wannabe!
i agree. he is the figurehead for trans division
good content.
dylan can go about being dylan   what im upset about is sensationalizing dylan over women that truly deserve it    wtf
100  psyop
nike could have talked with you  an actual woman  about their women s workout attire spokesperson. but they went with toxic masculinity.
why is everyone giving this demented man different names or titles  dylan is a smart dramatic biological man with big hands and feet! nothing more!!
such a good point!
absolutely agree.
him getting as big as he is  as quick as he did  proves  @ least imo  he s a plant!
this person turned himself into an snl character.
every brand attaching itself to this cultural cancer should be avoided in every possible case. we cant boycott everything but we should be loud   clear that recreational brands like budweiser  jack daniels   nike are dead to us. they dont care now....but thats not the point. we need to be funding the parallel economy as much as possible.you rock melonie. cheers.
love the decorations in your room....
that is clearly the case  especially after the   president   invited him to the whitehouse.
it s insanity.  nothing s changed
you are right about him being elevated to success  by some one in power . anthony douglas boutin freemason
he s a distraction from brics and cbdc. psyop  yes
yes it is. how did he secure two major advert contracts this quickly without any leaks
nailed it  psyop cyclopes
i m impressed with your christian logical thinking and awareness.
great video thank you
everyone that is eligible to vote needs to vote  whether you believe it has an impact or not. because it does have an impact  not voting has an impact as well. not voting is a mistake.
who you gonna call when dylan shows up with a rifle at your local women s fitness club
great video melonie. thank you for bringing awareness to this. and yes this kind of stuff is of demonic forces. you look absolutely beautiful. enjoy your day and give your pets a hug from us. and yes jesus can indeed change people. god is watching over you and may he continue to bless you  melonie.
look at the evidence.dylan has been transforming from a man to a man in a dress for over a year  having taken hormones and having had surgery.look at the video of him in the tv quiz game and compare this to when he was recently swimming in copenhagen.  his voice hasn t changed  surely you d seek some voice training .his body shape hasn t changed either  despite taking female hormones. there is not one inch of body fat  not even breast buds or thighs. in fact he looks like he has lost weight.in the copenhagen video you can clearly see his left cheek and jowl as he looks away from the camera. there is no sign of any feminisation surgery.his stubble beard remains prominent  has he not taken any steps to reduce this  again with hormone therapy  lazer  use of chemicals  he is acting the part of a woman  very badly  and someone is paying him very well.he has the acting part of a lifetime.we can only pray for him.ian
the cia has been doing this for years just in different scenarios.
it s ridiculous. and doesn t he think he s a 6 year old girl allegedly  if so  why s a  fake girl  drinking alcohol. don t you have to be 21 in the us
dylan seems completely harmless and very likeable compared to some folks on social media.
im with you you are not crazy
you are absolutely correct. this is 100  driven by spiritual darkness in high places.
your right about not judging him. that s between him and our father. i was told by the religions word god doesn t forgive killing. i had an abortion and i never felt sooo bad  i thought god had nothing to do with me. and my demon hung on to those words.  i saw this little church and there i was born again and the father says all sins are forgiven.  we should bring back   baby christian . i haven t heard it for awhile...god  bless you sister
willie realizes where he s gone that s where society pushes people like that you wonder why all the mess shootings and killings
he s making crazy money doing that act
i dont think he was planted  i think that society has become so decadent and sinful that people like him get pushed to the forefront because of what he represents.  what he represents is the deliberate disantling of our culture in favor of a  dystopian hell that he left is trying to create in its place
uh  i ve never heard of you or your channel but i ve never subscribed to any channel faster because i fell in love with your face immediately and i swear i m not a creep or anything and holy sheep shit i m about to get clowned real hard for this but you re beautiful mother of sweet jehovah!!!!  eh well  lol
it almost makes you wonder if it is a trial balloon to see how far they can push before getting pushback. what s the over under on how much mileage they try to squeeze out if him before he is no longer useful  can we get barstool to add the category  lol
of course he is trying to normalize his behavior in the minds of children and being celebrated and encouraged by multi million dollar organizations for doing it...... just reinforces the social gulf between us and our leaders
of course  this  thing  is a weapon.after watching 3 clips of this person you are ready to hate homosexuals. of course  this is not a coincidencebut probably the goal.i don t let such content trigger me anymore - i hopethere are enough people who have seen through this sick game in the meantime and don t let themselves be taken in by it.live love  charity and peace. if you re such sicksee things - turn them off....something is pointing a gun at you.
100  theyre all disposable so theyll push them as far as they can and then throw them in the trash when the ish hits the fan.
he was a guy on the price is right a few years ago. no way this isn t a paid actor.
you re amazing!!!
his day 1 of being a girl should have told you that he is a joke.
this is all happening by design. to keep us divided to keep us fighting each other. stand up speak up  we can all beat this crap together. lets go brandon!
the more everyone talks about him the more attention he gets. all you are doing is making him more popular he becomes b
live and let live would work if they didn t overreach every time. you bend here they want you to bend there. you bend there they want you to bend somewhere else. it never ends and here we are.
either a psyop or a grifter 100
corporations have to fit a  social  credit score  of inclusion.  welcome to the new creative government gaslight.
the nike things pretty funny  sponsoring women s clothing   and the person doesn t look like they ve worked out a day in his life
i m convinced he s a psyop. glad i m not alone.
it s just another sign of the times ...like it was in the days of noah and lot!
100  psy-op.
he is an actor of course he is not feeling bad.he just has to act the part he s got.btw why you think this is only going on in the  western world
a battle indeed.
lol at the reaction 2 21
i just found your channel young sister. god bless u!! i wis when i was your age i had the courage to stand up for christ and for standing against the demonic forces overrunning our society. wow! your message is powerful sis. i hope and pay your channel goes massive soon. ps. total psyop!!! i didnt even see dylan as that  explains everything!
dylan mulvaney doesn t appear to be trying to be a woman any more than do the drag queens.   drag queens are not depicting real women.  they re doing something else. i think you nailed it with  cosplay.   they re doing a sort of artistic expression of caricatures.  it s not self-identifying as real women.  it s not choosing to live as real women. it s over-the-top depiction of the woman archetype.  it s playing with the line between delusion and imitation. some are quite deluded.  some stop short of being deluded. none are real women. deep down  none think they re real women.  they re something else. we yet lack the shared vocabulary for just what they are.
i have never known a real biological woman to act like he does.
dylan should have been picked up with the other garbage when the trash collector came through!
love to see him on jeopardy lowest score in history lol.
a possibility.  but is hard to tell for sure. but why destroy beer  among other things
love these kinda videos melonie  you re brave and a good egg. demons are among us.
he s totally been planted. the costumes he s coming up with. some of the cinematics in a few of the videos  swan lake  where is he getting this crap  the assorted make up selections. do you think he made all of that  like he just wakes up and fixes himself up like that  no there is a professional crew fluttering around him and it s all staged. total psyop.
once upon a time david beckham was on everything  but a least he was a professional footballer so you d expect him to be on nike boots or beer ads  but he d still leave the bras and tampons to his wife to promote!
boycott will work if everyone sticks with it
this describes our times perfectly.   ephesians 6 12   for we wrestle not against flesh and blood  but against principalities  against powers  against the rulers of the darkness of this world  against spiritual wickedness in high places.
this generation doesn t drink like previous generations did.it s all about marketing.all the corporations are trying to crack the code on the next generation of consumer.
i m sick of the sight of those people . never be psyop to me of course  but to impressionable young people and their long suffering parents  i would definitely think so.
amazing show   delightful for a true womans voice on this complete nonsense .......
trans is the new cash cow for the powers-that-be. just found your channel  love your content.
he does not represent me  and i agree he was planted  i thought that from the first time i saw him!!
there are some people who would greatly benefit from having a large closed hand make high velocity contact with the area that contains their major sensory facilities.  yootoob speak
i believe it. i thought the same thing. the timing is just to convenient..
i totally agree with your statement  it s time to speak up . without pushback things will continue to get spiral  nosedive  downhill and our kids will especially pay the price.
that is a great theory. and i think ur are probably onto something. nike just signed this clown as well soooo it s gonna keep rolling.
egg
he s an actor. even if he is insane. it s all a parody.
he needs to be permanently cancelled  period
dylan is an example of how the west is falling like rome..! society is sick
if pee wee herman and jim carey had a daughter  his name would be dylan.
imagine actors like dylan becoming such a mainstream replacement for women that even your stalkers start driving across the country for dylan instead of you too.
dm rose up way too fast up the corporate ladder for it to be on his natural nontalent .invites to the white house plus major endorsements from nike   budweiser clothing are just a few .how does a no talent climb that fast .it takes more then just a good agent .
he s like aoc  she actually auditioned for the part among other candidates  she won the part to be the candidate in a safe democrat seat and now she s playing the part as a congress woman.
dylan is a plant sounds plausible
i like the way all the women who complained about men and  toxic masculinity  are now the ones being canceled  and now protesting against this   well... this is the monster you created and you now need the men you hated so much to come rescue your asses from it! xd
not planted but fit something they needed and is being used
it s rare to hear someone so young have such a mature frame of thought. it s refreshing to say the least.
the  courage to keep going   poor dylan. he s got a mansion  more money than he knows what to do with  tons of fame   attention  what more does he want  not only are they erasing us  they re replacing us with cheap imitations. even good counterfeits are detectable. let s see these trans women with their natural look  very little makeup.
reporter  what is a woman joe biden  a human female that drinks bud light.let s go brandon!!!
dont just boycott bud light  ladyboycott it!!
love this video  just one important thing to point out. dylan is not saying  day 1 of being a woman . he is saying  day 1 of being a girl . something extra sickening about this. he doesn t want to be a woman bhe wants to be a girl. a girl with a  barbie pouch  instead of the bulge.
i m done with this shit
he is trolling everyone just to see how far he can go. no doubt he never thought people would actually buy his act this far.
never comment on anything first time watching. i m not a right wing nut. i believe in god. i have to say this go steelers!!!!!
i would not be surprised if the wood shop teacher turned out to be a performance art project aimed at exposing the hyper sexualization and objectification of women by the trans community.. or he s just a weirdo.
that is one frightening looking person. looks like something ripped straight from the pages of a horror story.
um  yes  he is. it s all you see  and it isn t because his own people are showing him off  it is the people and channels of the right wing libertarian nature. if these channels would quit giving him attention  we wouldn t see him nearly as much. either  these channels are part of the psyop  or they just want.t views themselves  and don t care if they push the agenda.
sick   tired doesn t cover it anymore  how about repulsed   disgusted
i m willing to accept that he s an actor playing what he believes is the role of a lifetime. elevating that to the level of a deliberate psyop assumes far more competence and forward thinking ability than i m willing to attribute to those in charge
vote. support the candidates by issues moot color. support pro-life candidates. look at the candidates voting records what they support-not what they say.
great arm  work
you don t think there is a blueprint being followed   this stuff thats happening is not random  its by design.  that doesn t mean it s not eventually going to fail but this how they dictate to society.
@matt strathis  like i said  i don t think the people in charge are that smart.
@charles hurst  they may not be smart but that isn t going to stop them from trying.
well  it s not crazy at all !!
let s go steelers!!! 412 let s go girl!! kennywood ads also  please marry me
cosplays a woman.  exactly. and it s insulting.
if dylan wants me to think he s legit  he ll get the bottom surgery. until then  he s an actor.
well done feminists! you all got more than you all can handle! and yes   we are living in the end of days
i wouldn t doubt it a bit  praise jesus and have faith.
wow  well said
you re a steeler fan. that rocks.
psyop is a valid concept !!
it s a psyop for sure  the question is what is he trying to distract us from
great job!!! 100  an industry plant like no other. it s all an act. you must find video of him as contestant on the price is right dec 2020! not trans then btw. just a desperate actor. it s so transparent how profoundly desperate he was for attention. he would do anything for fame and it could not be more obvious. someone must have seen it and recruited him.
dig up videos of zelensky before he became a political puppet. i see a lot of similarities here.
look  kids! look how happy and successful you will be if you become trans!  it would make sense.
completely agree  all this overt support for a bloke putting a  woman-face .i believe it d be interesting to check his bloodline s  who he knows knows him etc... speaking of  woomens safe spaces and modern feminism   ecolifes fake womb seems to be an interesting concept that s linked to a certain mindsets type of behaviour...
he needs help!!!
i just came across your channel for the first time and you literally said everything i said to my husband a few days ago....thanks for your voice....keep it up.! blessings
think the best thing you said in this podcast is your confession of your faith in christ happy 1993 new covenant passover made by a promise with the blood of god.
it is natural for dylan to accept jobs to make millions of dollars by taking advantage of idiot companies who want to cancel women.  it won t last forever.
why the blank walls  mel   can i buy you some displate  posters
did china joe and friends put dylan in place to create a giant short sell. it would be an interesting setup to create dylan   create notoriety  set up a short sell  pick a day to tank the stocks and when the damage is done  by the shares back at bargain basement prices....insider trading.....ps she called the sanitary engineer a he....the truck was driving by and dylan assumed the engineers chosen pronouns. how disgusting that she assumes that women couldn t do hard work or that they have the physical strength to do such a job and earn an engineers wages rather than suffer from wage discrimination being a clerk.
trump s trumped-up indictment charges  for one.
dude looks crazy as hell jumping around like a clown
must be really tiring having to act that crazy 24 7
he s far from the first no talent loser to come out of nowhere and get famous for no reason. what s sad is how many people fawn over him.
i liked the video  thanks. both you and your content look nice  gave a sub  huge virtual high five from hungary!   oh and sorry to say but steelers suck  d
that s not a  woman ... that s the the joker.
it s not quite a psyop by hollywood  but close. he s being used for marketing by these companies because the companies are trying to satisfy their esg score goals. it s basically a social credit system for corporations. when their score is high  the corporations get easier access to low cost financing and greater access to investors. that s why there s so much gay   trans   pride acceptance type marketing lately. the bigger topic here is who s deciding that pushing the trans agenda is necessary for a higher esg score and why.
he is an off-broadway play actor. no doubt he has been hired planted by whoever is behind this.
anger and hatred are negative emotions only when they are misdirected. never fear to hate the odious.  - alfred orage
how many real wemon has budwiser supported
i appreciate your take on this  but  it does not  fall more on the brands  than dylan. the brands are taking advantage of the opportunity that dylan is giving them. he s an actor  and he s clearly been an actor for years. none of his actions are a surprise at this point. but you need to realize the hypocrisy in what you said
did him her etc...figure out how to use tamps yet
i love our conservative women..the dogs in the dem party are just depressing
2 20 you said it. cosplay. it s a planned larp
the canadian teacher does what mr. garrison did 20 years ago...oh  and your dylan take is pretty much spot on
heads up. anheuser-busch is owned by inbev now. inbev is a brazilian brewing company. brazil is a brics nation allied with russia and china. you guys are defintely getting played.
god bless to you all crusaders stand up
in the beginning it almost seemed like he was making fun of it look his earlier vids
i don t care what people do with themselves. but when they make a mockery of a sacred being like a woman  that angers me. what angers me more is women who support it
of course! what was your first clue
and he wonders why no one wants to be with him
that s just because  thanks to women  modern men can t handle a real woman
satan is bbb his army  and dylan is one of his soldiers.  dylan doesn t need your money. he s getting paid by those who owns the money machine
i ve never chosen political sides and i voted once and it was for bernie but i will definitely be voting red in 2024! the top 1  are now marketing to the bottom 1 .
i feel you are spit on with this theory.
psyop  sure  but for more deceptive reasoning. smoke and mirrors. politicians  especially  do not care about what the local world is doing  it s providing an inner struggle that keeps our focus and prohibits is from looking into their passing of legislature and our presents in foreign affairs.
i was convinced he was a troll  but man has the joke gotten old...
this is so wild to see  i m literally at a loss for words each time i see something like this!
males do have  milk production  material. however  males do not have the hormones to actvate. although the typical american diet leads men of middle age and older to develope  moobs  that is man boobs. i have never heard of such a man nursing a baby.you are right about god s plan  and not making mistakes.
dylan is mocking women and it is infuriating that he is getting so much attention and money for it. it is so insulting.
absofuckinglutely true 100
why does a little girl  behaving as such  seem endearing and uplifting  yet dylan mulvaney  pretending to be a little girl  absolutely infuriates me. his schtik is so insulting to adults  and nobody is the least bit interested in his freak show  except the younger demographic on tictok. i believe that men who see this individual  are actually part of a large group of predators circling   trying to find a way to bypass and strike this imposter. they know it presents a danger to vulnerable youth.
how did dylan know it was a man in the truck
make gatekeeping great again   and apparently you ladies need to gatekeep being women. what a world we live in. stay strong and keep speaking out  melonie. you re amazing. god bless you.
saying this guy is a plant is ignoring opportunism. dylan is disgusting  but i doubt that he s part of any grand design. i m more inclined to think that he did this weird shit on his own  went viral  and now everyone is looking to cash in and get a piece. dylan is just the clout chaser who caught the carrot. he got some attention. and  attention begets more attention. so  dude got weird until he was noticed. now that he got noticed  he s the darling of advertisers who exist for the sole purpose of.... getting attention. since you mentioned twitter in your video  really  the internet is the inverse of reality. in the really real world  extremes are typically rejected. on the internet  normalcy gets no traction. you don t watch videos to just see normal  everyday life. you watch youtube and tiktok to see something unrealistic. sadly  society has lost touch with the fact that online reality doesn t match true reality. also  your constant references to christianity  in light of the subject matter  makes me think of the work of a scientist named john calhoun. i personally have never been religious. however  i do have respect for those who are. i have concluded  partly due to what we re seeing now in society  that it takes more faith to be an atheist than to be religious. the secular crowds are talking some wild  easily disproven shit. all this gender ideology  for example. i never heard a follower of jesus say something as stupid as that boys can be girls. i can t prove whether or not god exists  but i can prove basic biology. interestingly  calhoun s work  which can be looked up under the headings  mouse utopia  universe 25  behavioral sink  or death squared  all seem to explain what western civilization is facing now  in both a religious and scientific context. https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc1644264 pdf procrsmed00338-0007.pdf is a fascinating read on the subject.
he s an actor enjoying the limelight playing the part showing the world just how ridicules and stupid the american nightmare has become
whatever he is  i m really glad he isn t my kid.
god help the west
4 1 odds at this point on the timeline.
exactly everything is he does is so choreographed and like something from broadway which is where he has spent his life trying to get famous at doing.
damn i never heard of you before and stumbled in this video but you are based and i love it. when you started talking about elites and satan i knew you got it. we need more women like you. thank god my wife is just as based. god bless you.
this is completely ludicrous and a sick distraction
well i mean  it s certainly paid off for him.  i d have thought that most trans-people would have found him deeply offensive  as his  transition  is clearly performative and shallow.i find it bizarre how something so clearly insulting to women is allowed to slide in this day and age.  just because mulvaney has chosen to adopt the  trans  identifier  allows him to get away with excessive misogyny. it s a sign of the current times when you can have old  overweight men claiming to be as much women as actual biological women.  it s delusional.
i need a hat that says that lol
but we are attacked for even not wanting to be called ciswomen. we don t have that right. dark days
@linda g  i agree. i m sick of it too. it gets worse when you re spectrum
@wendy o koopa  i believe that. granddaughter is on the spectrum
thank you so much! god bless you and your wife
remember the bud commercial where men dressed as woman to take advantage of ladies night beer discount promotion.
i ve been saying this since the beginning of this charade. just watch any of his videos with the audio muted  and watch his eyes. this whole thing is a scam from top to bottom. it s completely disingenuous and wholly the product of wealthy and powerful backers. there s no way so many endorsement come rolling in so quickly if the plan wasn t already in place. even with all the commercialism aside  ask yourself this  how well-connected does one have to be to get a private  one-on-one sit down with the president of the united states  you think just happens all on its own  mulvaney is nothing but a carefully chosen prop meant to aid in the deconstruction of modern society. he  and his message  should be rejected by all sane people.
you aren t crazy  if you re crazy then i am too
new subscriber here and by the way you  hit the nail on the head  on  everything  you said well put  well said melonie!!.
if i wasn t upset about gender affirming cruelty and womens rights i d probably find him entertaining and give zero cares about sponsors if it was celebrating his trans womanhood  not trying to force the idea that bio and trans women are literally the same  theyre not! insane. but worse  it s dangerous!
maybe it s because of the past experiences that i ve had with some christians but i m not going to unless i know them personally or i believe that their faith looks legit i m not going to trust somebody who claims christianity as their faithi ve not necessarily had the best luck in terms of running into people who claimed christianity as their faith who were also good peopledoes the faith preach good morals yes yes it doesbe kind to one another treat one another how you wish to be treated love your neighbor blase blase all of these things are very goodthe things one should live their life by i truly do believebut any faith christian pagan or otherwise once it becomes big enough turns into a religion and stops being a faith and once it becomes a religion it if it isn t already can easily become corruptedblood and preached and worshipped by people who claimed to be of that mindset end of that faith and want to do good works but only seek to benefit themselvesbecause unfortunately we are humanity and by proxy we re kind of fucked we are imperfect this world is an imperfect place and it s rather fuk the nightmarish sometimeswith that said i have been seeing a whole lot of honest and actually cool christian people mostly on the youtubes these days
native deodorant also had an add with himwill never buy again
i m just sick of all this  courage  talk. he s a young person that gets to rub elbows with the powers that be and gets  likely millions of dollars  in endorsement money. not saying any of that brings happiness. go do this is saudi arabia and then i ll consider him courageous. on the spiritual front i think this is a manifestation of baphomet worship we were seeing often in pop culture in the last decade or so. i noticed this trans push came right after we were seeing it with beyonce  katie perry  lady gaga etc.
him being a plant is obvious
you are so right!  thought this for a while too.  bud light and nike just sealed it.
dylan is here to highlight biological female privilege. biological women are constantly wearing men s clothes and behaving aggressively in today s society and nobody bats an eyelid for them mocking masculine identity. biological women are allowed to adopt masculine traits with no problem at all. however  it s interesting how when the tables are turned that biological females simply cannot cope with a male dressing up as a woman while adopting female traits. the root of the problem is biological women who deep down are misandrists and transphobic. men have the freedom to wear women s clothes just as women have the right to wear men s clothes.
stop attributing everything to  satan . people have free will  and are plenty evil on their own.  just blaming some unseen force takes away accountability for the evil choices.
2 48 anyone see ukraine s zelenski dancing just like this in leather tights when he was an actor   omg
any product dylan promotes i m going to boycott
actually i usually drink bud wiser or bush beer but i am not going to drink it anymore i wanna go walk then they can go broke
i have long suspected this. the whole thing is way too easy.
for transgender being a minority  there is so much money to be made by companies from that group and from the emotional groups of people who believe they are defending the society of living with free choice.
read your bible daily and let the holy spirt guide you  it s what you are called to do.
he is a minion meant to distract from the real issues
i entertain the notion that given the divisive nature of this trans activist phenomenon that suddely appeared out of nowhere that the whole thing is sorosesque in nature. i m a man. a real man respects women.
god girl  we think alike almost.
glad to see you back. hopefully no crazy stalkers lately.
god have mercy  on him  jesus please open his eyes to see the truth give him a heart of flesh and removes his heart of stone   allow him  to experience a supernatural act of god in his life to wake him up to truth
the entire trans movement is a psy-op. it s the simplest and most logical explanation for something so stupid and devisive. it s like it exploded out of nowhere. like a psy-op.
oh totally i bet he goes home and kicks off his high heels drinks a beer - scratches himself and play video games.  he s mocking and insulting women and laughing all the way to the bank
why is satan always getting the blame for humanities missteps must be nice to always rely on a make believe scapegoat.
great question. and i think you re on to something here.
don t forget he s a trained actor
2 thessalonians 2 15-17  therefore  brethren  stand fast  and hold the traditions which ye have been taught  whether by word  or our epistle.now our lord jesus christ himself  and god  even our father  which hath loved us  and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace comfort your hearts  and stablish you in every good word and work.
amen.  accept jesus s free gift of grace  salvation .  we can t earn it and don t deserve it.  these are the last he last days and the rapture is at hand.  accept his gift  thank him and live.
is dylan mulvaney a psyop   yes...  yes....  yes...  i agree melonie!!
dylan a psy-op   no.  dylan is a fame-seeker who will do anything to get the attention he desires  without regard to either who  or if it does  hurt anyone.  he was on a game show  on ellen  just to build recognition of his  brand.   when nothing came of it  he transitioned to she because that s the flavor of the day.  he s a grifter  and nothing more.  all the metaphysical talk about spiritual warfare and fairy tales and bastardized egyptian greek mythology is unnecessary.  we are simply in a battle of communists vs. federalists.  there is no hokus-pokus.  it is possible to address the issues at hand without the religiosity.
good vid. subbed.
pretty sure in that depression like video  dylan s got his 5 o clock shadow creeping around.  he s putting on a show.  it won t last forever.  meanwhile  the idiot brands that have backed this will never be forgotten.
you talk about satan yet you ignore leviticus 19 28 which says   you shall not make any gashes in your flesh for the dead or tattoo any marks upon you  i am the lord.   this passage clearly prohibits tattoos
you had me with you right up until you started with the religious thing. i m sorry to say that i put that right up there with espousing one s views on sex sexuality gender and slowly indoctrinating them to your views  which you consider to be superior to those who lack religion. the three cardinal things to avoid speaking about in public are sex  politics and religion  but i suppose that d leave us with nothing to talk about at all! is it just another form of  conversion therapy
whatever it is doing   its not working for the brands   their sales are collapsing
thanks for identifying him as a male because that is who he is
this is just my opinion  people who want to be labeled as a transvestite have serious mental issues. i feel so sorry for actual people who were born with both parts and the parents had to make a choice then and there what gender their kid will be. that 0.01  chance of it happening is scary and heart breaking sense you will always question if you did the right thing. those situations my heart goes out for them  however people like dylan who clout chase just because they can t be labeled as  special  make me sick.
you get a legit  stamp!
i m glad you mentioned spiritual warfare because that is what this is! i pray to god and that we put god back in the forefront of society! i remember when people spoke openly about god and had morals. these sickos grooming children and this other unspeakable craziness just out in the open! i agree with you 100 can t blame mr dylan for capitalizing out the weird support he is receiving. how insane is it that not only are people supporting him  but they worship him. he had drew barrymore on her knees! just weird!
this entire paradigm is a freaking psyop - crazies time since weimar!
although we can admire the grift  the companies exploiting his popularity are despicable. where are the women s groups  now got one-shot by the alphabet crowd a long time ago  but there are others. it s good that you re adding your voice.the look on your face watching his tiktok says it all
yooo him being an actor makes so much sense.. id definitely believe you way more than these people when it comes to what being a woman is
dylan doesn t even have to know this is a psychological operation. all that has to happen is for money to be thrown in a certain direction. the person on the receiving end doesn t have to be the wiser. the receiving person thinks that they them selves are just that awesome.
in all seriousness  melonie  did you see keanu thompson s impersonation of dylan mulvaney on simpcast last sunday   it was creepy how accurate it was.
i agree  gaslighting us all
we can t get tired of talking about this until he learns we ain t playing around with him making a mockery of women everywhere.
crazy as hell!
you definitely know how to speak up great channel i just subscribe to it keep up !!
absolutely
i have a confession to make  i don t keep up with hollywood entertainment that much  so i don t know who dylan molvany even is
i ve noticed all the  no means no  and consent forms stopped after trans women were going into female spaces
@saltedroastedcaramel  now that you mention it...
@visitor  it stopped dead in the tracks after migrated came to europe too but that s a different story
you are correct
dylan is a man  man.
what one generation tolerates  the next generation will embrace. -john wesley
said a budweiser wants to go woke they can go broke
thank you!!!!
he s a trendie. like most current  trans  people  he only jumped on the bandwagon when it became cool  popular and marketable. the simple fact is that when something is algorithmically profitable  masses flock to it. that is how the wokies operate. why do you think they have a different outrage every week  gotta go with the movement with the most traction. and do note i said  most.  i know there are people who do genuinely have a mental situation where they feel they are trapped in the wrong body. the vast majority of those claiming to be so today  however  are fakes looking for attention and popularity.
kaitlynn is jealous. they should have a kitten mud wrestling.
yes!!!
i seen you react to some nf songs  loved those! crazy seeing you here lol
lucky you. lol
thats probably good lol
a wise man once said  ignorance is bliss
lucky you
we re gonna see this creep in a disney movie very soon
dylan still looks so much like a guy after 365 days. but really  it s more like 365 days of being a narcissist.
in that nike ad he looks like a character from bob s burgers
he s on some kind of heavy drugs.
i think he was planted  literally my exact thoughts
he is an actor....  period. this shi  show is all theater.
onto it. good to see
yes...dont be surprised if dark government gives dylan a partner and then a kid and become american family idol
i can pretend to be a dude if someone pays me just  150k. that s all i need. i ll be your dude.   i m a 43 year old woman  and menopause is around the corner. already sporting a mustache  against my will .  come on country crock  you hearin  me papps blue ribbon  i ll be your man!
it s all about fruit loops  look at me  look at me. very sick world we live in.
we know they love to destroy. at this point it s clear why the movies are the way they are  they are destroying what we love. no woke shows have been good  on accident they should be making a good show every now and then. i ve been trying to expose the occult in the media but i got censored back in nov when my channel was getting traction. this is all done to destroy   i m sure dylan is part of the plan. we have seen the stock prices  ticket sales  merch sales   so on. no one is buying any of this but they keep doing it  we all need to wake up   start talking about the real reasons. out of all the people talking about this you are the only one that is mentioning some of the deeper stuff. i used to love the nerrotics   drinkers of the world but honestly  i can t watch videos like that anymore  we know what s going on   we need to talk about it. they will get censored at some point   i m going to go down swinging with my morals intact. i m passing up working on a channel that actually makes money to help get this word out. and i really believe if we don t it s all over  we think things are strange now  lol just wait.if anyone is curious how this happens come over  i hate to prop my channel but it s rare info that i have documented with lots of pictures   examples. duality  mind-body problem   the occult are at the root of this.i m not a christian but i will side with them.
or  was he transplanted
a distraction cos they wanna get rid of cash
it s definitely suspicious..
there may be another aspect to all this. billionaires try to push out other billionaires and do various tricky things  like convince them to do a bad business move  dylan m  or invest in a new bad business various things that will get a bad hit and crash the net worth of that company and perhaps swoop in and buy companies up or ruin their existence. big players like to make big moves and annihilation competitors.
you re not crazy.  they are.
i can t believe this is the world we live in now
absolutely and totally morally corrupt to the core.
one person figured it out finally
dylan ia a plant alright. like poison ivy. well that s insult to poison ivy the charater from dc comics. we need more real women like you in this world. hope your day is going well melonie.
look up his grandfather  james  he was the president of the san diego padres  also big marketing  had ties to president nixon   he has connections big time.
i m not a christian either but also side with them.  i think it s important that more non christians speak out because it s too easy for the left to just write us all off as  oh it s just the crazy christians
@slowdiver  very well said   you make a great point i will bring up at some point. they are not crazy  i just filmed a hour long video talking about my past with them.it s not for me   i understand a lot of people are coming into it with that  fresh new religion high    i m way past that.but one thing i mentioned in the video i haven t posted is that the majority of people that i have met in my life that lead religious lives had better families  and friends   lived with better communities.like i don t know it prayer is real or if we manifest our thoughts into reality  but i know these prayers seem to do something for them as a whole.and look how can we s on a religion that prays for people when they need it i m glad to see people like you are out in the world  gives a lot of us hope.
i have thought this for a long-time.
i follow matt walsh and help support the daily wire but they helped create this beast by giving him alot of attention
you are right about christians being silent...silence is consent
instead promoting anorexia now when fashion industry was vilified they now moved to promote another body dysphoria.
he was on the price is right and tiktok before he blew up. i think he just tried something to push himself into the spotlight  and it took off. now since he s getting millions of views companies want to advertise to those views. i wouldn t say he s a direct plant  just hit the right thing at the right time.
he s a distraction  but from what
i like seeing smart women speaking up about this...and other issues.thank you
i ll take things that didn t happen regarding the garbage man saying hi to him.
where are all of the   me too  real women  and why are they not standing up against all of this lunacy
people would never lie and make a fool of themselves for money  would they  oh plus fame.
yessssss!!!! we will know our disinformation program is complete when everything the american public believes is false. cia director william casey 1982ish
pray for these dudes  so focused on looking like another gender and not what really matters...
do not buy   nike  buy adidas   hersheys  a zillion other chocolates   disney anything  gillette  jeremy  and of course ab bud products  buy coors if you like that ... vote with your     or these un-american brands will own us.  do it now!
dylan the industry plant or  transplant
melonie mac s political leaning   alt-cute
you need to review itsagundam s takes on dylan.  dylan has been queer  nonbinary  gay  trans  trans les  trans gay  nonbinary trans  etc.  he s done literally every option on the way to success.  it s a skit.  corporations don t actually care about cultural minorities so they can t tell.
of course he is.
no words for this chaos
so dylan did a bud light sponsor ship deal with them  huh guess i get to finally test out my new dragon slayer from berserk on my 6 pack case today is a sad day rip to my bud light supply
oh i don t think he s on hormones at all! he says he is but you would at least get something i have seen it even with old transitioners people who transitioned at 50 they even have whatever you wanna call boobs but it s there he has nothing. i think he got the feminization surgery because you know he s a gay man  he likes to be feminine  but does he actually want his body to look like a woman  i don t think so. also iv been saying he s a plant lol
thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  you are the only person talking about this...most are telling the truth about how bad it is but none venture on the how or whys
make sure you don t replace your supply with another anheuser-busch beer.
melonie as for  kayla  greg gutfeld of fox news mocked him.
a time is coming when men will go mad  and when they see someone who is not mad  they will attack him  saying   you are mad  you are not like us.  - st. anthony the greatthis is becoming more relevant as we become more crazed and degenerate across society.  it is time to become more diligent and devoted to our faith and resist this.
alternative brett cooper.  i m down with that.
dm is a stick thin man.
you are right about the modern diet and bud light!  lol!
dylan s so fake
there are no coincidences  who is the most popular youtube personality that s also on youtube kids  mr. beast . and what s going on with him right now
all the trans identifying males i knew in highschool acted like him. i think the way he s acting is genuine because i saw it first hand. that said  i think he s being pushed in the way he is because us on the right right adjacent roasted him for his misogynistic idea of what a woman is and he has a very strong appeal to younger people due to how so many people 25 and under have been almost brainwashed into liking musicals.i think he is partially a psyop while also being genuine with how he is.
you are right
your hitting it on the nose with the elite implant
18 05 i fully back melonie up on this statement seeing it with my own eyes
it is a psyop.
my girlfriend ask me to watch this new country vid with drag queens and i said i don t like to watch drag queens. she acted like i hated the people when all i said is i don t like to watch drag queens.
dylan mulgoofy
i actually miss the feminist!! you could defeat them with statistics. these  things  are out of control!! hard to fight crazy!!
a loophole is not the only hole dylan has found.
no more budweiser ever... who s next ... nike
your not crazy!!! it s no coincidence.
he might be a plant.  i ve been wondering the same thing   especially since he went to the white house
in dylan s sad post... what s all that dark s  t under his chin  when he looks up  5 o clock shadow
warning danger warning
it s time to find another girlfriend !
@loulou  yep. its gonna start with that and lead ti a bunch of feminist crap and false alegations or threats when you try to go against it.
poh....
might be ! lol. wake up. it s obvious!
many happy people are depressed.
excellent deduction. it s all just a little too convenient.
right on spot
lets say he is. why ! what could possibly be the goal of this
he didn t clip it off why
he made a deal with the devil
as a person from the middle east i so appreciate u speaking out and all the others who began to do so  we all had the idea that america was what twitters people presented  thought that christianity and religion respect was not a thing there anymore.so thank u for enlightening me that there is still hope in this world
did you check out his grandfather
always seemed like a parody troll.
he for sure is acting
check out jennifer bilek s interview  who is behind the trans agenda!! on the channel big picture with james patrick.  she has been researching this for a long time   just like finding most every truth  you follow the    and you ll usually find the who  what    why   that s exactly what she has done.  and if what she claims is true this is way scarier then any of my theories.
he might be. so many psyops these days. too many  conspiracies  turning out to be real.you look amazing. have a great day.
i thought the garbage man would ask if he needed a ride just hop in the back with the rest of the trash. and why do i feel like they were looking for this kind of response  i mean he really set himself up with  garbage truck
woman  please put something in that room
i appreciate you melonie
i believe you ve just outed this person and the role they are playing. they used to be better at hiding this from us. in plain sight too. jim morrison aka rush limbaugh. don t you fucking laugh !!! ok you can laugh but know that the jokes on you while you re calling bullshit without digging in the pile.i hope this finds you all doing wellwillard
if he really was portraying a woman he would never never be on camera or out in public with his 5 o clock shadow he often and in this video too has beard hair growing along his jawline.. girl if i even get a lip hair i m plucking that before being seen.. men don t have to worry about it and he doesn t... clearly
suddenly adidas leggings are so popular

this may be so very true

simple solution just stop giving him any attention and see how fast your overlords use someone else
i know  he looks like an overly detailed mannequin in a horror movie.
have you ever had a job stephen
don t do drugs man
@kyrogthemius  i don t do drugs buddy  i smoke a plant go play judge somewhere else
good to see ssdi came in on the 1st justin
@justin lingle  seganerd1991   trying to call it another name doesn t change what it is.
@marilyn beatrice buzogany  good to c what   lol
this is disgusting and evil
i ll second that. and yes to everthing about melonie. and again love hearing her spoke about jesus and salvation
thought your bank account was overdrawn andrew  good morning andrew. have a great day andrew
@marilyn beatrice buzogany  i wasn t overdrawn  my phone just acted up and i got that all fixed. anyways  i have money and so i can give money and i m more than happy to help out melonie as she takes on the narrative of the insane woke left.
@andrew robb   700 a month is a lot
@marilyn beatrice buzogany  well it s up to andrew. it s up to him if he wants to help support melonie.
@the real stephentv  does his dad know how much he gives to melonie  since he lives with him rent free
@marilyn beatrice buzogany  and money and this life is temporary but jesus and his love and heaven is eternal. john 12 25-26 whoever loves his life loses it  and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. if anyone serves me  he must follow me  and where i am  there will my servant be also. if anyone serves me  the father will honor him.
@andrew robb  did you get fired from boss pizza for dropping pizzas yet
@marilyn beatrice buzogany  andrew is an adult. he s not hurting anyone. what he does with his money isn t any of our business.
@marilyn beatrice buzogany  wow! i don t know why you re so upset about how i use my money but i will pray be praying for you.
@andrew robb  your dad expected you to have moved out by now but he is too nice to say anything
@marilyn beatrice buzogany  welp this economy sucks and i got to do what it takes to save money. money that i want to use to bless people because i hear god s calling to bless others.
@andrew robb  you don t save money at all. you give it to pizza customers because you are terrible at every job you have
off-topic but maybe get some furniture and art for that room. maybe a couch. but don t go nuts or nothing.
the muppets aint got nothin on this dude
did you mean psycho   then yes
did you just say satan
lol  he has a beard.
then let us all cancelled all this products that is supporting him!
he s paid to do it and i don t give a rat s ass about him or anybody else who does it stop giving them the spotlight
dylan mulvaney is the manchurian
i wake up    its a psyop
he doesn t represent anything except lunacy
i heard him laughing like pee we herman!!! yummy!!!
how many days have you been female and i know nobody invited you to the white house nobody invited me to the white house my mothers never been invited but dylan  is invited and why  i tend to agree with you there s something very strange about the situation and the way they re forcing this dylan down our throats
all brands he connects with are doomed. people are tired of this nonsense
ps  he reminds me of peewee herman.
yep  he s just an actor. it s all a joke..lol..
go get  em
he s never said woman. it s girlhood. he s a  girl.  it makes it more disturbing. he s playing a little girl.
i dig that tee!
reminds me of bruce jenner. old interviews of him saying how he had a need to be famous. he felt famous.
i think you are on to something  . heck yea ..
the world is wicked. the world has become so stupid.
the dude is just an actor
pretending is so much fun!!!
if he is a psy op they need to try harder...not buying what your selling!!
ding-ding-girl got to go! come on  my dear women  this is not a joke  these people are just erasing all the great things women have worked so hard for! i do not believe the lie!
although i was born visible  i identify as invisible. i am trans-parent. my pronouns are who where.
interesting.a conspiracy to flush out  the enemy.
definitely a psyop.
did you think that your take wasn t trashy enough and needed some conspiracy theory to go along with it
ya hes just a distraction
well he is getting a ton of economic support from somewhere. but can t get a date.next time they need a distraction you can just bet he  ll have a date.
well the ccp is using him. like they do for most degenerative content on tiktok
it s a clown world after all la la la...all the way to the asylum.
he is something for the sheeple to talk about ..
dylan is a freak show
i will subscribe to him being a plant . similar to a candace owens ..her story just doesn t add up..you have to go back to the beginning with here..these influencers appear organic but i m not so sure they are one thing for sure and that s disruptive and inspire division  so..yea   idk
good spot.
why does nike get a pass  i work in the sports industry. not a word. i refuse to buy wear nike products. sick folks over there.
in england 50 men in balaclava turn up to every trans protest and get protected by the police
they only think they are!
life as a shadowbanned person who may not speak
i can wear  womanface   but not  blackface   why can t i just identify as a black pregnant woman without the blackface or surgery
women come from venus  men come from mars .and dylan mulvaney comes from a black hole!
maybe he sold his soul to the devil for fame and fortune.
try kona brewing
this mockery of women is an insult you  and all sane people  should respond to with total boycott of every brand even mentioning him! in my house  in the uk  budweiser  not only light  is banned and my friends start the same! let them sell their pedophilic agenda to each other only... market cleansing  so to speak.
i do not know any woman that act like that wake up america
i am  transgender-transformed
no more nikes for me
looks like a dancing tree
mulva!!!
pizza gate project
he s so clueless he s probably a psyop and doesn t even know it.
i have thought this always
dylan is the epitome of the absolute mockery of women. i find this whole act disturbing and contrived.
yep
it is all very very demonic.....    n the demonic behavior has gotta stoppp
he is doing it to make money then he ll trans back
i think he s faking being trans  i really do
you ll have to look at the list of beers that inbev sells. and boycott those too.
whats a psyop
as for the boob guy they have pictures of him walking around in his daily life as a man . dressed as a man and looking like a man with short hair in jeans tee shirt and a sport jacket . once again another act for profit those poor kids in that school who had to go through this crap
yes.next question
nope  this is all an act! i liked him when i thought it was a bit  but as a woman just no!
is this a rhetorical question
he is playing along with the agenda. he didn t have to sell his soul. all the money in the world is not worth it.
it is possible... dylan is an actor and i think he is just trolling the whole world with is horrible bad offencive parody for pretending to be a littlegirl    woman . anway the whole woke trans insanty is part of a large psy ops and brain washing of the masses.
no not at all that would never happen in the modern world let alone merica.... extreme sarcasm
yes  i was thinking this to.
he s a freak
me and satan go way back
in the end  god wins.
i have a feeling you may have heard don t think you said hi dylan how you doing i tell you what he truly said but you know everybody get upset
you re not crazy.  but i dont think he s a  plant    but i do think he s playin everybody...he doesn t really believe he s a woman.  some sort of social behavior experiment.  he s making fools of his supporters and laughing all the way to the bank
my thing is its only psyop if you give a crap so i choose not to
05 40 his beard is showing lmao  dude needs to shave if he needs to keep up this act.
go stillers!
we must stop celebrating  sponsoring   rewarding people with mental disorders...
you maybe crazy   crazy like a fox
he doesn t even move like a woman
dylan hasn t been a woman for a single second in his life.
melonie your beautiful 100  woman.
it s something.
i see many more men speaking out than women  and we as women are the ones being mocked. women do not act like this. this parody being taken seriously is so delusional. i can t believe companies are buying into this. i think any companies that push this delusion  deserve backlash. what happened to the days when men just became trans without a the hollywood production your observations are right. no signs of actual trans hormones in him. it s all decorative.i don t even believe he s trans. i think he s an insult to women and trans women.i have more respect for the canadian shop teacher who was making a point due to his school forcing their liberal agenda onto the curriculum. he at least makes sense! the outfit was  huge  to make a huge point.
very possible not impossible too many connections to deny
joe b   dylan viganee 2 x bad actors
its a mans world!!! right
totally.
next richard simmons
david bowie  that guy from the 80 s music video for tarzan boy did the transgender thing better back when it was cool  not completely insane.
imagine having so much time in your life  we get it  you re not busy and are bored  and making a 20 minute video on dylan  who is a woman  stop calling her a man  bitch  and move on.
quit giving him so much attention
....now you mention it.......
actually it s face is very scary looking!! a horror movie where it gets killed in like the 1st 2 seconds of the movie would more likely be appropriate.   it  is a very attention seeking thing. what is with the sissy crap
believe principalities and powers are at work - and you will discover a new reality.
so sad
yup... he is a distraction... don t be fooled...
this humanoid is def a bot
it is too dumb to be real. what are we missing
melonie  yess   a realll    woman... yumm
a garbage truck dirver why not
bug spray.
he s still on day zero of being a girl.indifferent tolerance is clearly not the way to go.
where my terfs at
of course it s a psy-op. they ve deliberately chosen the most repulsive parody of a woman for demoralisation purposes.
i wish that a woman reverses the process by pretending to be a man and to film and post her videos every day. you will see how the reaction will be different.
every time i see a clip of it..
i honestly thought he d make an excellent counter to the trans ridiculousness. i thought he was trolling trans. he would have done better to do that. oh well.
the chinese are probably walking across the southern border  as i type.
in all 43 years of my life  i have never once seen a woman who acts like this dude. and there s a reason for that...he s a dude  pretending to be a woman  women around the country should be getting out the tar and feathers to track down every one of these dudes who are now pushing them out of top spots in athletic competitions  jobs  and are making a mockery of their womanhood. shameful.
it s too orchestrated. agreed.
dylan is running out his 15 minutes of fame for all it s worth. once the dust settles  and his clicks views decrease  he will reverse course and try to cash in on his transition back to being a man...
days of girlhood is what he calls it.  he s a man in womanface.
dylan acts the same... screams the  same .. when he was a boy actor in tv game shows nothing changed
more than possible bird.
ding! ding! ding! you win the prize! yes  a big  big psyop made by your very own government...but the joke will be on them. have patience. something wonderful is coming.
i watch him as a cartoon character but i don t buy what he endorsed  like tampax  bud light and nike.
he needs to meet a real women and get a beat down country girl style
he s an insult to me as a woman  he s a grifter! imo
correction  he masquerades as a girl
yes  were all tired of whatever that thing is. that isn t even entertainment it s so cringe it s sickening..
i agree either hes an actor thats gay or hes just gay and psychotic clearly he is not well at all
y all do know he is a professional actor every trans person should but upset but hey it s freaking disgusting and i am not putting up with this for 5 more minutes.
yes spiritual war fair
yes! he is baphomet incarnate ... lol
what you are auggesting is a fact.
ef nike too.
butt -wiper beer case s have not sold in millions of stores and a sales rep on youtube is worried he might lose his job to support his family.butt wiper beer is crappy corporate beer like coors and others
melonie said it right  he definitely resembles a skinny man  not a woman.  this dude looks like a new species rather than a woman
all of this stuff started with women s rights so it s funny to see women getting annoyed. i mean it s fine by me. i can t stand the trans thing but it s just funny because this is what it was like when men had to listen to women bitching forever about how men had it so much better
carrefull i hear tate speech you saying the truth will get you jailed
you need only look at his previous attempts to gain fame to see he is just a grifter. a plant  hilarious. a narcissist looking for fame and   .
hi i may or may not love you  i may or may not have ate a 10th of a stick of butter the other day..
sick
dylan should shave before he videos himself...
totally is. glowies
he is flat-out mocking  adult human females aka women.
he wishes.
he s a hysterical attention seeking overactor at best.
make a fool of it self
no no he is just a man
no shit  sherlock comes to mind.
dylan really overly tries to out perform women. women  step up your game
a trans kardashian-- when people in society continue to support and raise people like this up in society we are all fuqqed.
guys got tired of being discriminated against to the point where they identify as women now. stop treating men like shit shit and second class citizens and guys wouldn t be doing this
someone needs to point out to these people that he s not a woman he s just a transvestite  so are all the others like him who cosplay as a woman...
melonie can you have a man dressed as a woman that looks like you do one of your videos  see if you re easily replaced.
the old divide and conquer routine.. its all a distraction.
he was a contestant on the price is right...when he was a dude...
you want to know why these transgender women are loving being a woman  well because they dont have to suffer all the pain of actually being a woman  they dont have to actually go through menstruations or birth  they dont have to fight twice as hard to compete in sports  military training  they dont have to suffer the hormonal imbalances. these transgenders are having the best time of their life enjoying all the benefits without all the consequences and they are getting praised for it.
i m confused
this feels like blackface.  at least i m offended
i don t even subscribe to conspiracies  but i believe it s clear as day that he is a plant. he is not even good.
days of noah
he is not a woman ever
could you sit right
feminism was so busy chastising men that this happens  the trans movement takes woman of the year
yes
nah you re reading to much into it  he s just  a freak who s not well !
a..b c ya
scratchbeverage pretending to be beer features man pretending to be womana lot of us are tired of hearing about the trans crap. we re not going to pay a company that sells cheap beer and promotes sexual deviance.
spastic transvestite  respect the womb let s go brandon
what not to buy no lie not a time to be shy i stand with white pride i worship  adonai jesus saves
no wonder why your husband cheated on you and left you.
trans - light  when only the weakest pi   will do
he is a scamer!
disrespectful to women. playing on stereotypes. no one acts like this  you are correct.
go browns
im glad someone finally said it  satan is their god  and he is very real  and he is not playing around. but there is good news  god doesnt play neither!!!! book of eli style.
in other words he might not be a normal queer
yes a black psyop
stop talking about the freak
i m sick of this nonsense
what do you mean god hasn t given ppl a choice  i thought we were supposed to do the great commission
he s an actor. mainstream acting won t make him wealthy  because he s a crap actor. here s his  back door  tactic....very clever
possessed
he she it is a shill.
man what a freak if this is what bud dose to you it should be outlawed every were on the planet. fast.
the fact that he was at the white house makes me hate joe biden even more.
he s definitely cos playing a woman literally as satire.. this isn t in any way a real trans person. crying 20 times his 1st day as a woman ridiculous
why the hell are you calling dylan she when he is a male
he s just a desperate dude screaming for attention. he was just clever enough how to exploit corporations today and he s now rolling in the cash. i would love nothing more than everything that is associated to him is boycotted and he s never mentioned again.
illuminati
play stupid games and win a stupid prize. hey you just won a prize! it is a free surgery to lop off that unit! congratulations  we leave for the hospital right now!  no you can t go home to get your tooth brush  you don tpass go . would they be tears of happiness or of sorrow  !!.
garbage  man   did dylan just assume his gender
working for the cia!!
i have known from day 1 when the first video came out that this was a gay man pretending to be a trans woman.  unfortunately he is gotten rich insulting real women.

honestly  the only soldiers in gods army capable of destroying this weapon are you women.
were you speaking intelligently and then started talking about speaking of the dead that live under the ground awaiting your downfall
sick of tattoos plastered on what was once a beautiful lady.
nope.. those are men. everyone has to get involved.
too bad the garbage  collector did not pick up this trash
what s wrong with 99  of you!!!
sodom n gomorrah...ring any bells..     starting to look like that here .  n getting full speed ahead..as of lately..n what happened at sodom n gomorrah  i do not want here...but we are heading there..thanks to the trans...n other bad behavior going on all across this earth
