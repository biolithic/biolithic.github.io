this world  desperately  needs more people like pn!!!
thank you you validated my stance i took back in 2020 on the virus and the j.a.b. you can t beat your god given immune system!
great message  pn! i fear that your words are lost on the masses. the sheeple are too far gone.
keep speaking truth in christ for america for freedom i m with you sister
i choose dangerous freedom over safe tyranny any day.
true patriots will end up having to truly fight to save this country and our freedoms.our foundong fathers knew this day would eventually come.
amen to everything said. she s right. we have our job cut out for us. ty patriot nurse for being a guiding light to us.
one of my favorite lines in a movie comes from my favorite movie  the last of the mohicans with daniel day-lewis. cora munro  when refusing major duncan s proposal said   i d rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgement . i live by that and i have a good brain that god gave me to read and research and reason and that is why i have never taken the poison and never will. i do not react well to attempts to control me and make me a slave to the machine. i question everything. i am a very healthy 66 year old woman who takes literally one med for my hypothyroidism. i breathe fresh air with a window cracked almost every night even in winter  get plenty of sunshine  move my body  lift weights so i can throw 50  feed bags over my shoulder and hoof them to the barn  keep chicken flocks and grow and preserve a portion of our own food  etc. we must be our own advocates and never surrender our bodily autonomy. thank you for all you do  every message of freedom and encouragement to take our health into our own hands. god bless your faithfulness to continue spreading these messages on this increasingly authoritarian platform.  cynthia
thank you for taking your time to inform us of what you see. god bless your efforts!
time is coming we will have to make a decision. talking won t be the solution
a significant component of what you re saying in terms of being controlled  is this case in point. i work at a larger mall in arizona as security. myself and another security adjacent to the mall  an affluent private school have been detecting a suspicious male in a car frequenting the parking lot next to the school where the kids pour out at certain times of day. he was not waiting to pick up a child  grandparent etc. turns out we we correct and he has been served trespass notice. i got in some trouble for sharing my pictures and details about this man. the school didn t do it. the police didn t do it. when i asked the officer flat out if he was known to be a sex offender  he said  i can t tell you that . wtfn  i didn t say that but my point is  compartmentalization  controlled flow of information. so  the parents networking on facebook realized they were being left out of the loop and got a bit upset just a few years ago it was the cops themselves that showed the pictures and told everyone around. i had sat in their patrol car just a few years ago and looked at the screen of whoever  may be a suspect . it s what you re not being told  lies of omission trust no one  disobey everything.
i m not a regular on youtube channels but great message.     huge corporations control our media  government and the banking system and have for a very long time. people need to get out of debt one way or another if they can  live within their means  use foreign new sources for the truth and tell our runaway government where to stick their mandates.
first i love your work.  20 yrs   nurse herei think we now have the great hope....i believe we will meet jesus in the air very soon.  the enslavement is only going to get worse this time.  knowing the word of god  being saved by the blood of jesus and looking up.  that s where our hope is.thanks for all you do patriot nurse!
amen  pn  i m right there with you. my heart is so full of god s love for you and an enormous respect for the family that helped you become the woman you are. may god richly bless you
i am totally in agreement with you  patriot nurse. we absolutely need to either become or remain  critical thinkers. i know jesus christ died for our sins but he also came to break the chains of bondage and set us free . as always i enjoy and appreciate your videos. you have a god given gift of discernment a day knowledge which is always so thought provoking and inspiring.  god bless you and keep you well.
i m proud to know you re a tennessee girl! i m from knoxville the only large tennessee city that hasn t fell to liberal scum completely yet  but they re trying hard. my line is about the get crossed and taking a stand comes next.
awesome educational vid. i m in the faith  freedom and the fear of the lord camp.
good vs evil!
my prayers are with you always  god bless you patriot nurse and thank you   por dios y patria
after all that we have seen over the past few years  and how so many of us are thinking why can t others see this    have their minds enshackled  is something that hits so close to home that i am literally crying right now. it is always a pleasure to listen to someone so intelligent  and so clear on her positions. if you weren t on our side  we d be in big trouble.
it s you. it s me.shalom
@christopherbic7688
@garyfrancis6193  true.
there are many!  most do not have a  voice.
i totally agree 1 million percent
lori  you re exactly right. i tested jan 1st with the coronavirus  it took me til jan 15th to start filling better  it was rough i ll be honest bcoz i m overweight  high blood pressure  chronic bronchitis  asthma and borderline diabetic. all the strikes against but for one thing  god. my savior. he is with me  always! never left me and we conquered it! also  i ve not had a clot shot either. thank you jesus!!! praise god
amen
@silvergrizzly515  i too had the crap in jan 22. i m 50 lbs overweight and mid sixties. i m bless with no real health issues. i m a nurse and i should have taken better care of myself. i am working on this now. i do encourage you to consider this as well. we will have increasing medication shortages. we humans have become lazy and we re taught to believe a pill can fix everything  without us really participating in our care. i too stood against the science stew. blessing to you.

hosea 4 6just my opinion  these things must need beads to bring the end on.it s sad to watch trapper john.
yep  the sheep are just going to be sheep  so the lions have to be stronger!
@shooter902  b
my relatives have called me every name in the book for prepping. they laughed at me a year ago when i told them to buy extra food before prices rose. my sister is obsessed with expiration dates though and when i had to stay with her while i went through the disability process she threw away every prepping item i was able to get. lost all my seeds  rice  beans  grits  molasses  honey  sea salt...everything. she and my nephew have nearly drove me to a nervous breakdown because i m building an emergency solar power system in my camper for hurricanes. i want independence  safety  security  low electric bills  and peace...and they can t stand it. it amazes me. unbelievable! she and my nephew live in two houses on the same big lot. both are loaded with money but have absolutely no emergency supplies of any kind. power goes out...they can t cook anything and use cheap  low quality led lanterns. they do have gas for heaters though...and during the winter storm in 2021  even though they have an outdoor shed  coolers  tons of totes...all their food in two freezers and three refrigerators spoiled inside the house. imagine that! i have solar power for my fridge and freezer and by may my window air conditioner will be running from the power of the sun. and they still don t get it after the winter storms and two hurricanes! they hound me and call me names and laugh at me!
@baneverything5580  rent a roadside sign stating  fallout shelter 1 2 mile on the right  no gun zone  if that  doesn t help move.
move..why are you staying there
@pionus3651   my guess is that not everybody can have the finances just to up and move because the world is falling apart
@pionus3651  perhaps he s worried about his nephew and sister being left to the wolves without him.
yes    the sheeple are too far gone  - far far away
shes jewish. do you know what is said in the babylonian talmud about jesus
@beckderm  some jews see jesus as the messiah but a majority do not.
@slavicone1355   probably the only ones are  jews for jesus
1 john 2 22 kjv who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ  he is antichrist  that denieth the father and the son. who does that  who hates jesus  who has been fighting against jesus   church  and killing them for over 2 000 years
@rodney-fs8kx  concerning jews and jesus- dont all christians   i am a catholic  believe in the trinity  father  son and holy spirit  therefore if a jew believes in god  arent they really believing in all
@aliceeckardt1694  many do not believe.
what do they do to baby boys  read that book.
@beckderm  to what are you referring   if your referring to the practice of circumcision  it was a health benefit in those days   also a form of identification of a people.
hope you are well  good sir.
@thetruth7046  myself and family could really use prayers  very difficult times  i know god has a plan  but life is still very challenging at times. i hope you are well  and thank you!
@isaac357mag  prayers  brother. life can be quite challenging and chaotic at times. some years it seems to last the entire year. the toughest of my days have molded me though  more than my good days. the last two years seem to have hit so many good folks really hard  spiritually and physically. what s amazing is i find myself coming back here  to patriotnurse  to find my balance. if she only knew  truly  what her words mean to those of us who are experiencing some dark days. you re a good soul  brother.   prayers for you  prayers for your family. may peace be found  and a calm come over your life.
@thetruth7046  thank you  i really appreciate your words of wisdom  i needed to hear that   especially spiritually and physically have been extremely difficult  i hope to have relief and i know god is faithful. i pray god bless you and i thank you.
how about wit and wisdom for victory
the problem is all the true patriots will be too old to fight and the new generation s  won t....they are the ones choosing laziness  self absorption and dependence.
@debrafrei4717  well time to get started before we re more of a trainwreck.
@vince6792  yep
@debrafrei4717  the reality of our circumstances seems surreal  as though it can t possibly be happening. not here in the us. unfortunately  it has become a self-evident truth no one can deny at this point.
i may be small  but i have no fear. i ll fight with whatever i ve got.
3   bill.
@tractortalkwithgary1271  you re 3  figure is likely generous
@vince6792  the saddest and scariest truth i ve ever heard.
@debrafrei4717  hi debra  try not let your fears overcome you. we are all in this nightmare scenario together without knowing the inevitable outcome. surround yourself with supportive people.
old school comms. old school everything. element of surprise. god bless america.
@valerierogers9609  fear only the almighty creator  valerie. be strong. you will find what you need along the way. think outside the box.
would u like to be on zero meds for hypothyroidism  use your dr s help and add foods high in iodine like broccoli and shellfish or the seaweed  nori  they use for sushi. i did this 15 years ago and i m still good enough to not be on meds.
@meettherakesfamily  i take iodine daily and i don t eat generally eat vegetables  fast food  stay away from seed oils  can t stomach seafood other than tuna for the most part.  i ve been on medication for over 22 years and  no matter what i ate  it didn t hasn t change my numbers enough to lower my meds. not everyone can do it.
people are afraid of saying i love you to strangers anymore. well  i m not afraid. i love you  cynthia. you re a great leader to follow. more people need to stand up to the  machine . we are born free and we have a choice in life. live free and die free or live as a slave and die a slave. toughest choice but a necessary one. we re going to die either way. when i was in the military we had a saying   which do you choose  to die on your feet fighting or die on your knees begging for your life   we choose freedom  not liberty because liberty can and will be taken.
@paulacromer2360  god bless you  paula. much love back to you. we should bow to no man. my husband is a disabled veteran and he has refused to bow as well. praise god for all the strong men we have left in this country. be safe!
my kinda gal
i believe the time to make a decision is right now!
@cindyc6728  yes
that time is already here
we have the most corrupt people in government right now..
time was right a long time ago.
neither will voting.
great video!  pn is describing one aspect of the narcisstic relationship that all americans have with their current government.  it is a toxic relationship and at this point will not have a good outcome.  especially for those who can discern what this is all about.  this relationship is like standing on broken glass. it hurts to stay and it hurts to walk away. only by dissolving the relationship will one be able to begin the process of tending to your wounds and begin to heal.  you are correct about the  talking.
who wants to be the first example    lol
@thomasgellos1732  why do you lol  do you find this amusing
each person has a breaking point.  we are all afraid of loosing the freedoms and leisure we enjoy right now.  i will not take the mark of the beast  nor will i give up my guns  and i know the time is coming very soon.  i fully believe i will die fighting these demons  but i will not be in retreat or on my knees!!
@garybulwinkle82  amen brother
@garybulwinkle82  with ya!
i think we re already there mate.
uh  lets see  they want us to just shut the hell up  pay your damn taxes  get absolutely squat in return  and dont you dare complain!
@jeepstergal4043  it is a attention deprived basement troll.
goood  advice!!!
you can do a public records search for registered sex offenders. start with your town or city  then county  fr there i think you can check state but it would be big.
your post is very suspicious.
@marioarguello6989  how so
@peterwilson1295  as much evidence as you had for the  suspicious  character you mentioned.
@marioarguello6989  ya  i didn t mention every detail for sure that would have been a long comment. but bottom line  the cops didn t go out of their way serve trespass notice ie going to his house  unless they had good reason to believe this was an addressable issue. because they won t enforce trespassing theses days except for really serious offenses or real potential risks.
i had been seeing the same vehicle in the same area of the parking lot off   on since thx giving last year. no presence during christmas break  two weeks  on at least two occasions he avoided or drove off when seeing me. i m driving a well marked vehicle. his demeanor   attitude when i did have a couple of verbal contacts was less than reassuring. but just the cops response is enough to confirm for me.
@peterwilson1295  i respect that you have some humility regarding this matter. without it one could easily find themselves in some serious danger. if they are protected then who is protecting us  i told you that it would be difficult to explain my circumstance as after thirteen years i am still piecing together the details. i had something really scarry happen...anyways you are not alone as i am a spotter also. there is only so much that can be shared on this platform and i am just getting used to commenting online so i hope you can bear with me. i appreciate your insight and response...thank you from ontario
@richardstever3242  the  left  or liberals true democrats  whatever we call this section of humanity  i like say in this way   isn t wrong . i would also say that about trump. i wind up saying nothing in the end. seems every thought or idea cancels out the other one. for someone not used to commenting here  you hit like a hammer . i salute you.
@peterwilson1295  i m going to leave a message at you  ammo  video to keep this dialogue open.
is pn now a christian
yes i agree  it s amazing how they can t see! and at the same time  i thank god for giving me discernment to be able to see. the bible says in the end times many will be deceived. in addition to these people being blinded  i think many of us who do see are experiencing the worst relationships  situations and other things in our lives that we never dreamed would happen. for example  i ve already lost my two older children. one of them works for the cdc and is completely on board with what they re doing. everybody else not on board with that is trash. another one married a woman who is a complete narcissist abuser psychopath. he s lost his mind! thank god for my other son who is like us  he sees it. even when his sister pushed and pushed to get him to take the poison he refused. my husband is on board with me as well. we have had to deal with many medical people and situations and stand up for our rights regarding this. i do believe our guardian angels are watching out because we are listening  we know their presence. it s still very difficult though!
good to see ya again girl  you re pretty busy that i m sure. always love your talks!!... the bible is the word of truth   contains everything we need to know about life and how to sustain it s  cycles ... it s funny yesterday i was reading   again  in the book of judges  and that book describes the cycles that you are talking about    although you already know that   great history lesson about good kings   leadership  and bad kings  same  ...anyway stay safe   true and keep posting your videos  love ya!
amen sister! god bless you and all that you do! always put god first and live for him. if we don t have him we have nothing. amen
absolutely. we the people know how to take care of ourselves. we don t need the government  or any of the evil global elites from davos to tell us anything different! keep up the great work pn.
absolutely and without any doubt  your insight and wisdom make this one of the best channels ever. god bless and keep you and shalom. thank you. you are a leader  a guide  and a real sage.
always enjoy your truthful   accurate views of history   current.  praying for our nation to rise   be wise in our decisions going forward.    the most shocking thing to me over the last few years was american willingness to give up their own lives   freedom for false  safety!!!
thank you for your encouragement and willingness to speak the truth! god bless you! also so happy to seeing you feeling healthier again.
all of us are capable of doing good things for ourselves and others. no matter what  always stand on the side of truth  and no matter how difficult things may get  standing on truth gets easier and easier. we all have value and something to contribute if we walk in faith with the most high god! it is important to know whom we serve. never ask the devil for permission for what god almighty has commanded you to do!
i am praying that our citizens will wake up.  thank you for your calm demeanor  it made a more memorable impression on me.  god bless
thank you pn  thank you for sharing truth and wisdom  thank you for being here  for encouragement  for being a light in so much darkness. the big decisions we make come from the sum total of all the little decisions we ve made. that is a golden nugget for sure. prayers always  god s protection  blessings  and direction. shalom
really good stuff  feels good knowing i chose freedom.
thank you for your encouragement to choose freedom and the reminder of who do we serve!!
you were missed pn   do not underestimate the power of tech and ai to manufacture  manipulate  and ultimately determine our awareness to perceive reality. remain steadfast against false narratives and information cycles being disseminated. thoughts of caring radiant vibrant health is with you
again  another message right on target! i always keep you in my prayers! good health and strength as you go on your path of teaching  god bless!
patriot nurse . freedom   love  faith  common sense   strong values most important compassion . ..
there has always been 2 groups of people..  some who comply..  and those of us that don t...  take care nurse..  it s going to get bad around here...
thank you patriot nurse!  you always give us great information!
patriot nurse  have a beautiful and blessed weekend. lord god bless and stay vigilant.freedom in faithi believe in the sun even when it is not shining.in love even when i am aloneand in god even when he is silent.these words were found scratched into a wall in a concentration camp.
thank you pn. enjoying your education.
always a pleasure watching  learning and hearing the truth from you. god bless you patriot nurse
perfect! absolutely true. i am an historian and portary founders in lectures and on stage. you nailed it!
shes jewish.
@beckderm  she still believes in the same god i serve. i ve been in an all night live prayer service with her. i could feel the holy spirit moving. i have been following pn for years now. she is an amazing person and she is my sister in jesus christ! amen
yes. when jobs aren t there due to ai and we get an  allowance  or universal income they want to make reality  remember too the you will own nothing and be happy   you won t get your income if you don t obey i guess.
@vince6792  bible prophecy linking it all together. everybody better hold on to their hat. the cyclone is moving fast.
ok historian. look up  in the babylonian talmud about jesus  shes jewish.
@beckderm  and her religious affiliation matters because....why   we are all in the same stream. i care not.
@garyvandolzer8946  actions over words. you re right about loving one another. tribalism is actually detrimental and keeps us all from critical thinking. as long i m not buying online and using emoney and living by the golden rule i m doing ok. remember anonymous charity is true empathy
will continue to pray for you  sis. get plenty of rest and keep hydrated. i m not sure where i learned that  but that s 2 of the 3 things you need to do for respiratory   digestive  and wound health  lol. seriously   get well  and may ha shem bless you and keep you..
you re absolutely right patriot nurse   -  without faith  people turn to their new god- the government. political parties are the new tribalism. people willfully walking into mandated divisiveness. let us of good conscience remain faithful.
thank you as always for a solid  well-presented message
i got that thing like 3 weeks before christmas. i was so glad to recover.  and then two weeks ago i got a really bad cold.  prayers to you that you stay healthy.
keep preaching sister god speed is with you and god bless you.
such truth.thank you for speaking up. god bless you
thank you pn.  glad to here your health is back  have you in my daily prayers.  all who receive yeshua jesus shall be free indeed no matter what.
thank you for sharing your thoughts on this issue
so informative! thank you pn  i look forward to each and every one. i even  got several of the books you recommended and i am waiting on a few right now!
i found you awhile back and was immediately impressed. love you keep the faith and the truth!
we are in wwiii. i have regular intel up on yt. keep prepping guys
we have been following you for many years.  we are so grateful for you  and for like minded folks such as @reidhenrichs.  it is very refreshing to see people of faith encouraging us to be educated  be trained  and be faithful to our way of life and our god.
god bless you sister. if i ever decide to get married again  i hope the lord find someone that is like you to be my companion next time. i m already a person who is blinded by the world being pulled over her eyes for over a decade  and now i have to do my best to be a good father to our children and help my boys see the world for what it is. it s almost not safe to speak out even in combat sessions on videos anymore and i m going to have to cut it back soon. but in the meantime  i appreciate what you say patriot nurse  and it resonates with me. we are the fighters and the lovers of freedom. we are the ones who hoist the banner of liberty  and stand up on the hill in the battle. along with the fighters  long  live the republic  and may the lord return soon to cast out the wicked  and rule the world.
thank you again pn for yet another very profound message. your videos are and have been for many years  a source of real blessing to me.grace be with you shalom
time is short - keep the faith.
god bless you pn! you are truly a servant of his!
i agree what you are saying. going thru my history and things that i found this the first in my addictions and how time has proved this over and over throughout my life not just my addiction but in every aspects of live.
thank you for speaking wisdom   truth. we chose to not take any jabs   go with herd immunity. we did well.
thank you for sharing  pn! you are awesome and right on the truth always wins  and freedom will prevail for those that made choices...that is our god given right to have autonomy  and the courage to fight and stand up for the things that we want to be happy and pursue liberty...god bless you pn  may you have sound mind and health for many years to come
great message patriot nurse
great video  patriot nurse!you tell it like it is! luv ya!  keep up the great work!
i wonder if there is a way to break the cycle. perhaps staying hungry and putting a cap on our indulgence.great message pn. christ shall save us again. perhaps by a hand of another moses.
thank you so much for the confidence and standing strong in the faith that jesus christ has placed in you!  may god bless you and heal you in jesus name!  faith is all we have too stand and fight the good fight for god s glory and not our own!  you are loved here in tennessee!!!

really excellent message here  thank you
if we buy your online class  is there a time limit on it or can we watch it in different segments  does it allow for pausing   replaying to reference  offline download
pn  i about blew my top when i first came across the term  disruptive technologies.  also  so-called  stockholm syndrome  may not have originated in stockholm-- this mindset is probably as old as mankind. your video today makes me want to revisit  the fourth turning  by strauss   howe.  and it goes without saying  i must delve into proverbs again and the rest of scripture--a lifelong project.
thank you patriot nurse   i am a nurse who serves god. i work on being independent   make good choices each day.i appreciate your messages and videosgods blessings to you   pray for continued resorting of your health   jillyinsdretired pediatric oncology nurse
thank you  pn!
great insightful video.
bought a shirt to support a christian sobriety project street vendor today. just opened it  tried it on  n it says faith on it  n you started speaking about faith. i had no idea anything was written on t before unbagging. god bless you and yours.
the animals teach us a lot about how we should live. once i had chickens i talked to them and held them and loved them and all lived together even all my roosters never would fight and took care of each other even one rooster was chosen by all the rest to make sure they were all fed first and that rooster waited till they all ate then he ate after and protected and went to roost on time  until visitors came and their kids chased the chickens with sticks and showed them evil and even their parents blamed the chickens for attacking and chasing them when they came back over and so then on the chickens were aggressive to anyone but me. many other stories with other animals like bears. we need faith and jesus christ there is no other foundation beyond the one already laid down that works.
awesome video  thanks for speaking truth!
an interesting book was written decades ago. the aquarian conspiracy by marilyn ferguson.  my take from it was comparing the  parent child paradigm     wef being the most glaring modern hideous example  to an evolving   co creative paradigm . of readers today can put hair splitting   infantile   and divisive concerns about the so called new age aside  they may derive inspiration from this book. she was before her time.
ma am not only do you speak the truth but you re a very classy young lady. i appreciate this because my wife will watch you videos with me. keep up the awesome content and thank you.
i always leave at the end of these videos episodes on a happy note  thank you.thank you for making and posting these videos
appreciate all your patriotism towards freedom  liberty and god!bless you! have a beautiful weekend!
dropping truth  per usual
this video just came in my yt feed  as i was scrolling today. subscribed. thanks!interesting how i ve been pondering on several verses that tie in to your topic. i was thinking of the perverted opinions of eph. 4 32 and then how important the truth of 1 peter 3 17  being followed by verses 13-16   keeping in mind 1peter 3 22
patriot nursepeeps listen to youplease cover the stages of grieffor persons coming to terms with their corrupted health decisions and life limiting consequences as in denial they are blaming those that tried to warn them from not trying hard enougha well thought presentation from you will help us cope with their needs
keep speaking the truth. thank you.
thank you patriot nurse. very insightful as  expected. from a fellow nurse.
so good you give words from the heart and mind.
and if you have ever listened to klaus schwab....you know that the time is coming  and not far off at all   when we will all have to choose.   and choice of noncompliance ultimately means death.
thanks for sharing your wisdom. keep on speaking your peace.
in recent years i ve lost almost all trust in people with power   political or corporate. i see the natural cycle of man unfolding  before our eyes. i don t fear it because everything is temporary. good times will come back around. i m just not sure at what cost.
well said. great explanation.
love listening to your insight and that it s presented so well. so good to see you sounding and looking good and healthy again and i m quite sure all of your subscribers were worried. please stay safe in your travels and busy schedule and try and get as much sleep as you can squeeze in. i put my faith into one pair of hands. yours in christ.  ...michigan.
it is very optimistic to think that humankind can learn from their past mistakes. oh what a wonderful place this would be if that were the case. that is why history is so important.
very good   describing part of   the cycle of civilization    .  patriot nurse is intelligent  and she can read !!   bravo !!
i didn t comply  but it  sadly  was less on account of faith and more on account of hornery bull headedness... i m liable to not do something just because someone says i have to. you have to explain  with proof  why i need to comply. even then  i may not listen. i follow the intuition yah gave me. he made me a stubborn mule and i figure i ll be the best stubborn mule i can!!!
trying to get people to understand this is damn near impossible.
i hear ya. i kinda gave it a rest for now i do pray that god will intervene and open their ears and eyes and minds
prayers sent
this lady is sooooo bad ass!keep on sharing the path to the light
thank god  florida maquis told of you uploading as the tyrants at youtube never notify me when you upload!! great video great message and god bless you -pn

god bless you hun!!!! appreciate you sonmuch!!! god bless you and your family
thank you patriot nurse.   .
when someone says   you can trust me   you know you cannot trust them.
when the modern civil war does break out  patriot nurse  and the patriot troops of the article 5 army  a5a  return from the battlefield savagely wounded by modern weapons  i d like to have you as the a5a director of triage medicine.  you could so skillfully train the battlefield nurses and medics to render compassionate care to the wounded and bleeding troops with traumatic injuries
well said sister.
well when i was a kid back in the 70 s we had a local grocery store that when you walked in  your senses were bombarded with all kinds of smells.  somehow  all that disappeared because if a company does not show a profit in this country  it s bought out by a bigger company.  guess what that big company wants   yep you guessed it - profits!
glad to see you are feeling better. god bless.
serve god  not dictators.
brilliant! thank you!
patriot nurse is describing one aspect of the narcisstic relationship that all americans have with their current government.  it is a toxic relationship and at this point will not have a good outcome.  especially for those who can discern what this is all about.  this relationship is like standing on broken glass. it hurts to stay and it hurts to walk away. only by dissolving the relationship will one be able to begin the process of tending to your wounds and begin to heal.
pn  you have always been a shining light in a world of darkness.
i always look forward to your videos.
trust the government were here to help
shabbat shalom.. sifting is in progress... are we wheat  or chaff  feet on the ground  and not living in cyber-land  do we have integrity   can be counted on  or are we that person that never calls back like they say they will  little pieces of rotten fruit  begins to build up and ....makes us a big stinker! great video  and thanks.
love to hear your thoughts on the recent project veritas undercover video exposing virus mutation by pfizer.
you are such a beautiful patriot. i pray you re feeling better. much love from a grandma in arizona.
@2 53 the proper term with the sifting that s happening is called parallel economy . the grassroots of it actually started when the lockdown hit. coined by andrew torba  ceo of gab  he encouraged likeminded  freedom loving people to detach themselves from the current system of any sort  economical  medical  production-wise  what have you  and create a parallel system that mirrors the mainstream  and call it our own. to be fair  it has just started  and a lot of people have jumped into the bandwagon of homesteading  as an example. many more are emigrating from cities in droves  and immigrating and settling in the countryside  even if it meant for them to start over. one of the main drawbacks of it is  since it s grassroots  it s not centralized. meaning  there are dozens of pockets of small parallel societies  but aren t collective yet.
listen i saw all this coming back in the 1970 s .  i watched everything change over the decades.  great job p.n.  former u.s. marine vietnam vet 0311
well done! god bless!
hi patriot nurse   god bless you and your s.
been praying and will continue.
great video as always and according to the clock on the wall one contiguous take to boot.
mandates are not law . never comply
i really like your channel and i don t watch it too often but every now and again i glean some information that makes me honor you as a woman of god. i am not angry  historically of what the egyptian government forced israelites to do when building the pyramids out of mud bricks with no straw. what angers me most in these modern day times is how i am forced to rebuild these great pyramids out of mud and mier. this angers me because i am just like my brothers and sisters who have fallen short and have somehow become a slave to the ruling empire.
excellent thanks for sharing  enjoyed the truth.

@beckderm  hello beckderm  i had this video on while making dinner and i did not realize that when speaking of old testament sciptures  which i read  that the patriot nurse is jewish. i can tell you that i love both my fellow christian believers and the jewish people. i do believe both the old and new testament to be the word of god. food for thought  revalation 18 3-4   for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication  the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her  and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her luxury.   and i heard another voice saying    come out of her  my people  lest you share in her sins  and lest you share of her plagues.
hear o israelthe lord our godthe lord is one
all i can say is thank ukeep it upfellow rn
they know who took what.  stay out of their hospitals. a simple procedure has almost killed me    but god
sifting is like thinking. you do it consciously and unconsciously. you pick out and choose  and reject  on a conscious and unconscious level. there s two methods to sift wheat. winnowing. where when you have a wind stir up. you throw everything as in agitate everything. the things with substance have weight. you keep those. the things without are blown away. and then there s the more manual method. where you put it in a sack. and you bash it against something hard. likewise the smaller things without substance are broken up into smaller more fragmented pieces. which do not get caught in your sifter  and are thrown out or burned. --- they went out from us  but they were not of us  for if they had been of us  they would no doubt have continued with us  but they went out  that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  --- i would say most decent people would do better out and away from the apostate church and it s dealings. people have a sense of what is right and will not listen to common sense because of it. lean not on your own understanding. i can get angry with the amount of information when i m told no about somethings. but it has never been bad advice. that i know. god is doing a lot of sifting. and so are the rats. but i know. this country will never be the same when it s done. also. you can collect wheat anytime. but his is the fruit harvest. do not be shocked when an odd fruit comes your way looking more healthy than the wheat. tend it all the same. because it s the same pests trying to eat both. and there does tend to be less fruit than there is wheat.
the first commandment! have fun conveying it to these people.
god bless you and your family.
you are a beautiful  eloquent  loving and powerful spirit! may god continue to bless you in perpetuity!
thanks patriot nurse
so true !   .... what are we willing to give up  this generation has not been taught in school  how important it is to be a free thinker !the schools are teaching    to go with   what they are told to think .and to defend this teaching .against their own good .the liberal indoctrination is taught   ....... to our children .
testify!!!
the people who took the poison shots should never forget who done this to you
totally agree with this very beautiful  intelligent and honest soul  lady ... i also believe that we will be divided  and we will need to lean on god.
what can seniors do when we are in our 70 s   80 s and have no one to help
another  simple way to describe it patriot nurse  is like this   the first time  it was between the north and the south.  this time  it s going to be between the left and the right
hi sweetie normally i dont listen to long talking videos but you seem to grab my attention always keep going nursey...
you are one impressively intelligent beautiful woman. thank soo much for what you do.
the whole pandemic was an opportunity for the church to really put our faith to the test. to put faith over fear and to hold on to christ s promises. to trust in the lord and not in the mechanisms of man. to show the world who we belong to. did we do that  or did we fail
see what s coming ahead  make the necessary preparations to nullify it s effect. avoid  stay low  and when you have to act do it decisively.
god will be essential in maintaining our freedom in america
well said.
i can t believe  the cowardice of men that i have spoken to it s mind  blowing  and doesn t bowed well for liberty....
it s horrible.
when the men or women believe in satan s lies  this is what we get. when they know the truth  we get warriors who would rather die on their feet fighting than live on their knees begging.
@battleofarmageddon1366  i m not religious  but i ll back all christians  as our society is built upon this belief system and children do need something to believe in....

do you know why jews holidays are all at night
@beckderm  my guess would be because the day begins and ends at sunset.   people do have holy day services during the day for some things.
i had a blessing today.  i got to see my mom  she had that thing that was going around.  it s been 2-3 weeks since we saw each other.  we picked up my very important medication.   luckily the pharmacy is kind of nearby.  and also  they don t let you back there  they bring it up to the front desk.  they goofed this week  but normally they prefer to mail it to you.  then we got lunch.  my mom gave me an amazon gift card because i sent her a c   test when she and her so were sick.  turns out they had it.  i ordered coffee mugs and uno.  somebody keeps talking about how israel renewed itself.
big corporations buy up alternative products to prevent them from getting into the publics hands. just like in the early 70s when the moody brothers out of charlotte   nc designed and built a carburetor that got incredibly high gas mileage. the installed one on a  land yacht   and drove it to california on one tank of gas.the design disappeared.  it would have devastated the oil companies. do you wanna bet the blueprints are in a safe somewhere
as discussed on florida news yesterday  your thoughts on the 7600 fake nursing degrees given out for  15 000.00 a piece w nurses working who passed the nclex but never attended nursing school .from colleges like  palm beach college of nursing  etc ! thanks

good analogy!
french revolution comes to mind.how many commoners did it take to de-throne a king or a queen          during the russian revolution of 1917  bolshevik revolutionaries toppled the monarchy  ending the romanov dynasty. czar nicholas ii and his entire family including his young children were later executed by bolshevik troops.

as far as i understand god told the  people that he would free us from slavery and have our backs as long as we don t enslave others.
proud to be in the noncompliance camp
i m not a christian  and the bible isn t my scene. but in regards to government   i sure have come to many of the same conclusions you have.
exodus. 9. 13 and the lord said unto moses   rise up early in the morning  and stand before pharaoh  and say unto him   thus saith the lord god of the hebrews    let my people go  that they may serve me. k.j.v.
thank you!
authoritarianism is always a problem. we americans have little respect for rules and regulations that don t make sense. the 55 mph speed limit  prohibition  we contemptuously ignored these silly pronouncements. however we will scrupulously follow rules and regulations like we did the blackout regulations during the second world war. we were convinced that those regulations made sense and we carefully followed them. reasonable rules  sensibly applied and given vigorous public discussion  where everyone gets to speak.  even if a decision is one we don t like  being able to disagree is a given and giving voice to one s disagreement is a god given natural right which is protected by our constitution.     being ordered around by the likes of fauci really irritated people. i wonder why  handled correctly  the corona virus would have been a bump in the road.    in other words not like they handled the corona virus. they destroyed public confidence in institutions that require public confidence to function. if we have another public health emergency  a real one this time   getting public cooperation and support will be a problem. they really pissed people off and made themselves despised in the process.     big pharma made billions. they tried to suppress any kind of treatment  used the most heavy handed  soviet style suppression tactics and over the top displays of authoritarian force that i never thought could possibly happen in any english speaking country. they wrecked the world economy  disrupted everything in the world and probably caused problems in areas that will not become evident for years. a cv variant was a better preventative than the shot.    nobody trusts them anymore. fools.
thanks again god bless you  from australia
new law in wa state  gives health officials the right to have people arrested for speaking out against the agendas and health mandates. new washington state commission to label people as domestic terrorists  no christians are allowed to be a member of the commission.
i wonder what country will embrace god now that americans have forsaken him    i wonder what country he ll embrace and bless and make mighty for all the world to see!  is there 1 with enough wisdom to ask him for his presence    i guess over time will tell and the world will have to wait and see!
my anti vaccine neighbor s husband was on a ventilator for weeks at who knows what cost.  i know of no one who was vaccinated where that happened. just like not wearing a motorcycle helmet  individual actions have societal ramifications.

belonging to a religion is just another form of dependence.  many of those proclaiming a religion signed up for and received inoculation from the gods of pfizer  moderna  etc.  i think the hypothesis that religion makes you an independent thinker is flawed.
all christians unite   we aren t to be divided . one holy catholic apostolic church .  the bride of christ  the holiness of the church is christ
100  !!!!
you speak of the cyclical nature of humanity  because of the sin nature of mankind . but time from a biblical view is linear. we go from  in the beginning god created  to christ s return to the earth to  destroy those who are destroying the earth . christ s return is the  blessed hope  of the christian. titus 2 13
the patriot nurse is
on that great day of the lord .he will crush this wicked system .
i don t even know of a single friend who is willing to give up face book.  it s like stockholm syndrome or something...
i did not comply   never will. i have a sister whose husband just passed away from a heart aneurysm jan.5 2023 he was only 72. we are having his service tomorrow. my sister also took it   she now has congestive heart failure  her heart is functioning at only 24  . i begged them not to take it. i told my family if they took it  i would disown them  i guess they believed me because they didn t take it.
thankyou so much p.n love from west yorkshire

my uncle majored in american history.
yes ma am  but people are too   woke   to realize it.
exactly right.
everyone deems me a danger..i been walking around this nation for decades ..its like living among angry idiot zombies with no relevant data who are completely compromised non stop
god was with us when america was founded. faithful christians endured much but still they gave thanks to him. we have broken his commandments not as individuals but as a nation. america s churches since the wuhan flu have lost many followers after two years of persecutions by our government  we institutionalized killing babies  we are in the process of institutionalizing sexual immorality and openly perverting small children. my only question is  does god hear enough prayers for help and contrition in part for these major sins against him. keep praying for our nation to shrug off this evil  by any means necessary.
only the lord god almighty can fix this mess.
gather the oil  never cease in prayer. lifting each other up in prayer. society will continue to be declining heads on swivels be aware of your surroundings.
just remember all this was run by the dod  hhs and others
thank you

8 billion people on this planet and the advent of ai precludes any guess work about our destiny. few are going to toss the shackles of bondage and be free  most are already slaves. the self discipline required to cut loose the dependency on gov t corporate direction and services is about the same as getting a life time fatty to shed the weight  not likely
this thing will be mandatory in the future.noncompliance will be rejected from society.
god bless
we know the enemy. what are we going to do about them  i have ideas.
02 24 2023 hello teacher  nurse and best friend to all who deserve it.  today a beautiful forest green turtle neck  curls  pearls and a new brooch and manicure. hot stuff for my favorite video teacher.
beliefs may be the start of freedom. but if you look up the history of any group. they achieved so called freedom by running out of reach of the oppressors  or  from blood running in the streets. as far as religion being targeted. they went after any large group.
my legacy is having rejected the world  ie...sin  satan  glitch    and be a witness of the kingdom of yahweh thru his son esuha

@beckderm  no  and who cares! talmud is extra torahdeuteronomy 4 2ye shall not add unto the word which i command you  neither shall ye diminish ought from it  that ye may keep the commandments of yhwh  your elohim which i command you.
does it really matter what the babylonian talmud said about anything the torah and the prophets predate the talmud  and yeshua had very unflattering things to say about those that followed the talmudic teachings.the torah distinctly says not to add to or take away from the words in the torah.  the talmud did a lot of adding to.  therefore  it is invalid.i will say this  though.  if the jesus taught in most churches was the actual character in the bible  then he would be disqualified to be messiah.  however   yeshua  the actual person in the gospels  lived out and taught the torah.  he was the reality that casts the shadow through time itself that we call the torah.
yes  i was saying you got your spark back.
for me i choose our father in heaven
hello  patriot nurse! gtsy!

i m not sure if you re hebrew roots. if you are  please read this.deuteronomy   5   2 - 3the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb. the lord did not make this covenant with our fathers  but with us  those who are here today  all of us who are alive.this statement was made at the second giving of the ten commandments and the rest of the torah. god only made his old covenant with the jews  and only the ones who were present at this event. this old covenant didn t even apply to their fathers  ancestors who were jews .  this means the old covenant isn t eternal or universal. it wasn t always in effect  and never applied to everyone   especially gentiles. stop following a set of commands given to a different people for a different time. then god revealed that he would abolish the old covenant and replace it with something entirely different jeremiah   31   31 - 32   behold  the days are coming  says the lord  when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah  not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt  my covenant which they broke  though i was a husband to them  says the lord.we are under a new covenant and the old is gone. hebrews   8   13  in that he says   a new covenant   he has made the first obsolete. now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.if you choose to follow the old covenant  you ll be held responsible to keep all of it. don t die in your sins following an old law given to someone else  al law you can t keep  a law that will damn you to hell. god bless.
you know to keep torah  or at least you are reading it each week. yet you still choose to use pagan names  isaiah 42 88  i am       that is my name  and my esteem i do not give to another  nor my praise to idols.if his name isn t that important  why so many scriptures like that one
jesus is the true healer  not those serpents wrapped around the crucifixion nail with fallen angel wings...  repent people  iron and clay don t mix..  daniels 70 week prophecy!  repent!
i really don t care anymore. sorry.
this video is too complicated and serious. i m going back to my video games and watch the sports channel talking about who will win the super bowl!!
go away
