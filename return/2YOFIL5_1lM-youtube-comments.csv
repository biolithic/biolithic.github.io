ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that you are doing just a great job with this new video streaming and I really like your Bible verses that you preach and read to us every day. anyway keep it up and I am so happy for you too melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie. anyway God bless you melonie.

so I was thinking about what you said and that person suggested  and I started to pray every day and out loud... I like it! youre supposed sing praise to the heavens for God almighty  aren t you  pray out loud! melonie  I wish you could meet my mom. she is a scholar in the Bible s teaching without being too weird about it. I aspire to be like her in a lot of ways. she doesnt preach too much  she s just like well this is what it is  and thats where I stated the body is the temple thing with you. it wasn t to crap on you. it was just this is what it is lol    believe me I am a sinner myself  and I do so many things wrong.

love your videos meloniemac!  I especially appreciate the verse of the day and how you are bold to talk about your faith. keep doing what youre doing.
