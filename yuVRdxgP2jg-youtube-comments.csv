the left   women aren t just feminine stereotypes!! also the left   if you don t fall into those female stereotypes  you re just a repressed trans! you can t make this up
make men masculine and women feminine. it s not a bad thing to show people as they are. you addressed this recently in your nebula changes in guardians of the galaxy 3.
the war on tomboys is unforgivable.
as a person who grew up watching he-man  she-ra  thunder cats  voltron  transformers  care bears  strawberry short cake  etc...i felt so represented.because as a small child  i was also a hulking blonde man  a red headed woman  a hybrid cat-person  a giant composite robot  who transformed into vehicles  a cuddly bear with a symbol on my stomach  and a pastry-themed little girl.i don t know how horrible my life would have turned out  had i not been so well represented in every single facet of media.
i don t mind a well written female character as long as she not the bestest thing ever. which is how most female characters seem to be written as.  3
i agree  melonie. companies need to wake up and realize what they have done to all of these franchises and to quote doc brown    in order to put the pop culture multiverse back as we remember it and get back to our reality  we have to stop pandering to the woke mob and focus on good stories and  amazing characters!
as a kid  i always got bullied for being a nerd and having good grades.nerdspaces were my safe spaces  my happy place.and then somehow all those bullies wanted to be nerds.they didn t even change themselves  same assholes as at school times.now  my happy place is at home.also tomboys are best girls.
shout out to the tomboys hanging on to femininity while society tries to tell you you re dude. you might not need my validation but you ve got it. it s not being a  pick me  if it s true.
my younger sister is like this.  she likes doing a lot of the same stuff guys enjoy.  but she is still very feminine  because she s a girl!   i am very annoyed with modern society that is trying to destroy traditional genders.  if people want to pretend they are something other than they actually are - then fine  let them do that.  but they shouldn t try to force their views and their way of life onto everyone else.
remember when cap was holding the helicopter one handed  that put me in the gym for a couple months lol
i feel like there are two kinds of female nerds. women who treat a fandom the same way that men do  and then there s the women who are only in it for the shipping and who likes fetishizing gay and transgender people.
this is why it s so important for us to gatekeep the things we love! the reason why games like elden ring and dark souls are so successful is because they know who their audience is.
not just marvel  it s time for men to toughen up and become manly again full stop.
tomboy here. its amazing to me that this is still happening with all the women coming in. i didnt think it would last this long  mainly in comics and marvel movies. like holy shit  chill a bit. i want it male again too.
thing is no one was ever truly excluded. when you say  male doninated  it just means that  it s primarily men that like it. when i was younger the idea of a lady that likes the same things i do would be a dream come true. it would be amazing.
i m a nerd but i m half and half with being tomboy and girly. anime  video games  playing dolls  loving comic book and the movies.
women are more than welcome to like what men do. it doesn t mean women are secretly men and vice versa. i m glad you shared this video today. you look great too!
a lot lot lot of people  including myself  found characters like ellen ripley to not only be strong female characters  but also able to maintain femininity. hell  even her daughter in alien isolation had those traits. you see this all over  from rogue  xmen  to power girl  from lara croft to zoey from l4d2  april oneil to scarlett and lady j. youre right though  some things like dnd and disney marvel have bowed to the infiltration  some have been pushing back like in warhammer 40k.
the tomboy bit is what gets me. you can do  say and wear whatever you damn well please and still be comfortable in your gender.
fellow tomboy here. i agree with everything you said. you can have great female character without having to tear down male characters just to prop them up.  but all they are doing destroying them in the process. games are still fine but most feel watered down. i love action movies  but i miss martial arts movies. they don t make them as much as they did when i  was a kid. everything  everywhere  all at once was refreshing. i don t watch sports anymore. just not fun for me anymore. its also nice to see a fellow ninja turtle fan. i still have my tmnt pillow. and not ashamed to admit it.
they don t even know what they want to believe. that s why there s so much infighting in their circle. all they know is they want control.
@redpilledcrimsonyou really can t make that up. they do say that. by their sexist logic i m a repressed trans because i m a dude that likes sailor-moon  my little pony  and several chick-flicks.it s really dumb how individuality is foreign to these people.
@demonicremption  narcissists have no individuality.    they are the sole group that you can actually say  all group x do y  and be correct.   they are unique in being non unique.
you probably shouldn t generalize so much because the left can throw the same shit back at the right.
@walter bonsell  who s generalizing  i call it exactly as i see it.
i don t think there is anything wrong with a woman having a good tone body like lara croft with abs and some muscle in her arms but yeah i can relate like those women in those body building contest that look like that have a mans hulk type body
@jeremy smith  lol your comment isn t negating anything the op said. lara croft is still very much feminine so his point still stands. no one said feminine meant not having abs and no one said there was anything wrong with that. where are you pulling this from
@jeremy smith  how did you not even land in the same ball park
from my perspective there is no reason make all men masculine and all women feminine. don t get me wrong  but i guess it s better to show that people can be different disregarding of their gender and other things. what the most important to show the reason why people are what they are  some interesting story. my point is that films should not present stereotypes about humans because such stereotypes can harm. i am not a fan of marvel  now  but were in the past .
black widow remains the best female hero they ever produced. i miss her
speak for yourself! about time they have their women get just as jacked as the dudes! they are superheroes
@emily seville  emily grace seville   nah  it sets an unhealthy idea all around that men try to be more feminine while women try be more masculine.  we need to go back to traditional ways that promotes it not for some nonsense idea that i ve mentioned above.
@emily seville  emily grace seville   you re right. men and women come in different shades  not every guy needs to look like a linebacker and lead armies and not every girl needs to look like a swimsuit model and be hyper-emotional   so it s reasonable to see merit in characters who also follow similar variations  but i don t think that s jeremy s point. regardless of how near or far a character lands from a gender stereotype  their masculinity femininity should not be abandoned  because it s still a part of who we are. lara croft  for example  is strong  independent and courageous  traditionally  we emphasize these traits in male characters . and there was some backstory to that. but what completes lara s appeal is that she is also feminine. especially in the earlier incarnations of the character.
you never saw alien didnt you  ripley is a woman  not woman masculine  just a woman you got bada ss by fighting aliens.
@cw yes its called the earths core.no one can be the core.unless they are emitting strong gravitational pull that drags oceans and land and people on them.
so true
@demonicremption  my nieces and nephews watches my little pony but i do love sailor moon my favorite was sailor mars and sailor mercury did they tell you that show is boring than they have a serious f     issue and they wasn t raised in the eighties and nineties those are genze kids
yet they did.
@raximus3000  change taskmaster ghost from the second ant-man and wasp but get the pass cuz of michelle pfeiffer and laurence fishburne but black widow i was like what the f    is this you don t believe me watch fat samurai review the only way you going to make that normal again you got to get rid of the a  holes
@christopher loyd  good luck with that  they put them in and now they are plague on the industry to the point where a movie about a bear high as the sky might overtake a  marvel movie.
ayuuuuup
@cw  typical right wing trumpanzee reply.
who s saying this cite your sources.
you just did  lil broski. no one says this nonsense lmao.
@the majestic spider-man  cling  cope  harder. it s all you have
you can t make this up  you literally did
@cw  i expect to hear  cope  from blackpillers but i guess redpill is barely different sometimes.
@walter bonsell  that s because all they know is projecting their bs on others
@raximus3000  ...the ant man films have never done particularly well  incel.
@dragonage2ftw  and yet this one had the next big bad guy and was not really a small event like the other 2. the world was at stake! and it cost 200 million.
yeah  i remember when the progressive stuff was about not being bound by stereotypes  but now the boundaries are hard fixed and if you step out of them you are now something different.
@woku  you should really take a look at tumblr if you think that shite is made up.
@ghost101 she hulk and others have always had muscles and looked somewhat masculine though street fighter women also are super jacked.this isn t an issue with the designs in general its how its used and viewed by people today because of bullcrap media
@emily seville  emily grace seville   it has nothing to do with  stereotypes  and it has everything to do with your actual hormones and how well they are being regulated. for example if you re a man and you get all your essential vitamins and nutrients from foods and get enough vitamin d  zinc and vitamin c and every other vitamin your body needs and eat only animal fats  organ meats and vegetables you would naturally be very masculine because you re healthy and your body is regulating your hormones correctly and the same goes for women as well but obviously women would be feminine because men are naturally masculine and women are naturally feminine and if your either a man or a woman and you re not masculine enough or feminine enough it s simply because you re not healthy and your hormones are not being regulated and that s almost always caused by insulin resistance from eating carbs and sugars that end up taking you out of ketosis and depleting all your vitamins and giving you so many deficiencies your body can t regulate your hormones properly. the micro biome also has a large affect on your mental state as well as absorbing vitamins so it s best to make sure it as healthy as possible with probiotics if you want your hormones to be regulated well.
let s go
@josiah bicelis  even if a man eats well and is healthy they don t all look the same.and at the same time whats wrong with men and women who look different  some women have short hair some have very long hair.some women are tall and curvy some are petite and skinny.some men are overweight and have dad bods.it means nothing to have those designs in media.
@josiah bicelis  being healthy isn t gonna make me look like fucking thor dude l.
nebula didn t change.
@wolvewick  ripley was extremely feminine. the first movie her goal was to save her cat  the second movie was all about saving her surrogate daughter. ripley and sarah conner are incredibly feminine archetypes which is why people love them. their values are conducive to a successful society. women who are celebrated for wanting privatized power has no positive benefits for society.
@shade draws - sinr studios  how is saving a cat and daughter feminine  its a pet owner parent instinct.this feels like the stereotype that caused the director of the silent hill movie to change harry into a woman. because he felt it made no sense for a man to be so emotional and search for his daughter the way he did.
@emily seville  emily grace seville   oh  but men are naturally masculine and women  feminine. that s what we should strive for  and if there s something  harmful  is portraying men as feminine and women and masculine.there is total reason to make all men masculine and all women feminine.
@josiah bicelis  . this comment is bs
@perseus classic  so things have to stay the way they are because you said so  gotcha.no wonder we don t really get good media anymore  writers seem to insist on being stubborn children who can t accept that humans are individuals. you know  just like you.
if someone think a bad thing need to touch grass
@jeremy smith  you go to the gym you ll see it
indeed
a war on tomboys is a war against the god emperor! for the empire brothers!
@deltacos burrito   the emperor is pleased. meme
i feel you i was so happy when i was included in m.a.s.h as helicopter   in spiderman as spider that was born and identifies as man
you just mentioned all the best cartoons that i watched after school in the 80 s.  i remember gobots  silverhawks  and the bionic six as well.  don t forget c.o.p.s. -- probably the best cartoon series ever!!!
@noneyabidness9644i know you re joking  but as a 90s kid myself your comment reminded me of how prominent the imagination was to our generations.so in some respects there s a grain of truth to this joke. in short  of course you felt represented as you pretended to be all of those things.  p
@demonicremption  i didn t pretend to be any of them  except he-man. and  pretend  isn t a representation of me.
i loved g.i. joe great animations back then. buff men and sexy women. this is the way.
he-man gay af tho
@chewsberry  buying into those woke critical projections there.
@eric woods never heard of cops but if it ain t spongebob or batman the animated series it cannot be the best cartoon ever.
@demonicremption y2k was a time of grand imagination.then again my generation sort of had the area 51 raid and flat earthers being renewed.
@commenting is dangerous  nah he gay
the wonder woman movies are good
@the boss wolf  the first one i liked. but the second one i didn t
@the real stephentv  agreed the second one was doggy poop.
exactly. araki  jojo bizarre adventure  boah the bioweapon  gorgeous irene   said he wrote bsd female characters in the 80s which is why he made the only female jojo protagonist. his women characters needed a bit more development but they had strength and a personality. he did much better than a lot of the women characters in recent stuff. most mangakas have. studio ghibli had similar criticism yet they have female protagonists who are mentally strong but also has a heart. funny thing is some of the bland women heroines we see were written by women who have no idea how to write characters with a personality. plenty of good female writers but unfortunately the ones being hired in gaming film industry in recent times are obsessed with race and gender stuff i.e rugrats and velma show.
the first one was phenomenal and was the first thing i thought of while watching this  the 2nd one  not great. but i think it gets more hate than is warranted. i think because of how different it was look wise  and a different time i think people immediately said no. and as far as the complaints about wonder woman technically r@ping the man whose body chris pine s character inhabited  show me one straight man who would be forever damaged after unknowingly sleeping with gal gadot.
@nemesis the slasher   didn t araki create the first proper yandere with yukako in diamond is unbreakable  he says he wrote bad characters pre stone ocean  but characters like yukako  lisa lisa and holly were always super entertaining to see imo  all being very feminine and flawed  but also carrying a type of strength within  be it in power  kindness or both.
as far as i remember women in comic books used to be really hot what happened that movies now showing men and women  looking the same and thats suck.
the thing is that they re trying to imitate adopting japanese storytelling for years now but they re doing it wrong because they re making it with western political lenses.in manga and anime  there s so many godly strong women and is stronger than the men but they re still feminine out of the action.there s a gag where this women hit men but it s not a condescending manner just pure humor. they try to apply that with feminism talking point is the tasteless implications of it in western media.i m not gonna bow down to praise japan as a paradise because all the degeneracy in the west originated there from yuri s  yaoi  shippers  benders  furries etc.   but they do know how to caterorize it and create a new ip out of it not shoehorn it in everything thay existed like how holloweird is doing.
@the real stephentv  that s because the first movie focused on how great wonder woman was from the comics as a character and all the above. when the second film came out it was made by a different person with different ideas and they pushed a lot of woke ideas into the film that s why it didn t do as well as the first wonder woman. you think they would have learned from captain marvel why they shouldn t have done that to wonder woman.
@black phillip  no the reason why a lot of people didn t like the second film was simply that they put a lot of woke politics into it. that s why a lot of people didn t support the second film versus the first.
the irony is pokemon did an episode in which team rocket had body transformations  james got big boobs etcthe episode as far as i know was never aired in the west
@cd marshall  apparently  they see masculine men and feminine women as being  unrealistic body types.  despite every character on he-man being modeled on actual people.
@noneya bidness  that is the point it should be. perfection is something never achieved but constantly inspired to work towards.
@chewsberry  there is absolutely nothing to support this statement.
@noneya bidness  i mean he man is kind of a hard body type to get to especially since body builders who got to that type probably used steroids.
@cd marshall  yet humans will never be perfect i feel.today everything feels dull and sad and that deep down we are just masking the fact our species is kind of cycling back and forth and will either make no progress or die pretending to.
@chandller burse  i had that body type  steroid free. as the model who was used as reference for the character did  as well.
@noneya bidness  you hadhad
@chandller burse  lmao i don t disagree but that doesn t demonstrate a proclivity towards men.  maybe wierd but that depends on the person.
@michael houk  he man was a hero i never grew up with and saw as one of those weird dumb old fantasy shows.i just wanted spongebob and batman.
@chandller burse  i like the weird dumb fantasy shows. but i get it. i m not a spongebob fan but batman is awesome. alot of those 80s and early 90s shows i really liked.
@chandller burse  yes  past tense. and i obtained it without a single drop of anabolic enhancements.
@dragonage2ftw  dude...look up the meaning of words before you use them.  this valid argument disproves my world view...it must be a fallacy!
@chandller burse  spongebob calls for help from batman and batman gets an underwater breathing suit to help him.
you re a person i thought you were a bear with an emoji tattoo on your tummy
@keith pace  what
@noneya bidness  good for you greek god.now do it again
@chandller burse  only took 3-4 years  bubba. it is hardly a difficult feat.
@noneya bidness  then do it again.and this time keep it.
@chandller burse  why  i didn t keep it last time because i was tired of the effort for no additional gain. why would i do that  again  are you daft
@noneya bidness  as i said.its difficult to have and keep that body type thats why people use to use steroids.
she-ra was also blonde. you may be thinking of teela.
@chandller burse  some do. many don t. every body type of high tier athletes degrades over time. it is why jordan isn t still dominating the nba. age happens. doesn t mean his physique is unrealistic. even regular people  who put no effort into their physique  get fat and frumpy with age.
@robin thrush  no  already said blonde. so i put in strawberry shortcake s hair. i also did a composite of voltron and transformers.
@noneya bidness  when did i ever say it was unrealistic
@chandller burse  you re saying you need roids for it. meaning it isn t attainable  naturally.
@noneya bidness  well  you said  woman   so i m kind of doubting that. but assuming you intended that  then you ve listed shortcake twice  ...and a pastry-themed little girl.
@robin thrush i didn t repeat traits. no reason to. i combined  twice  different traits of similar characters.
@robin thrush  and yes...a little girl and a woman are different. if you were unaware.
@noneya bidness  yes  i was aware of that.  that s why i doubted you meant strawberry shortcake with  red headed woman  because she s not a woman. i don t know who you made a composite from with either of the two points i ve referenced though. it s just a small critique  no need to be defensive about it.
@robin thrush  i responded your criticism was meritless  as the context behind the descriptors is blatantly obvious.unless you think i should ignore your comments  responding to them is  defensive  now  i guess
@chandller burse  nothing just forget it.
@noneya bidness  i never said you need roids i said its difficult to do it without roids let alone keep it.
right!  the main appealing audience was children. who can just use their imagination and insert themselves anywhere
@chandller burse  difficult to keep any physique  period. roids don t help retain physiques.
@noneya bidness  but roids help build muscle and make it easier to exercise more do they not
@chandller burse  sure  if you do the work  eat properly and rest well. if you do that  you ll build muscle either way with your own testosterone.
@noneya bidness  yeah well arnold and those other guys didn t find that satisfactory.
@chandller burse  neither did i  it is why i quit. i hit a wall that i couldn t get past naturally for a year. so  i had a choice. go with roids  or be done. i chose be done.
@chandller burse  but to be clear  that wall i hit was high. i was larger than arnold when he won his first several olympias. i simply stopped getting stronger  despite working longer and harder than ever.
where in the world is carmen sandiego
@mike fajohn  not specifically mentioned  but sure. why not. and as explained  i combined traits of similar characters to avoid needless repetition.
best response i have seen to this crap lol
and dont forget how  being strong  some how means you get to act like tighten  from megamind
exactly. mary sues aren t interesting
the only one i recognize as the bestest actor ever is steven seagal. i don t like it when other more serious movies just steven seagal themselves.
yeah it s hard to find a well written female  especially written by females  she hulk for example . i watch a lot of shows about cops  fbi  firefighters etc and i notice a pattern where the woman often is just as strong  if not more  then the men of same caliber  she s smarter  has no patience  has a huge ego  can never admit she s wrong  and is hard and unable to be gentle or soft ever. the examples are criminal minds elle who they replaced with the kickass prentiss who was also capable of weakness  fear and femininity. in chicago fire it s dawson who never asks her husband anything  making decisions from taking in a foster child to giving them up to letting her dad move in all without ever asking him or caring what he thinks. blue bloods has it too and basically any other show where the women are being tough they create this unlikeable character  also rings of powers galadriel v lotr where she was strong  powerful and also sought others guidance and was incredibly beautiful and soft
@norman readdis yeah so far eastern media are the best bet for good tv without political agendas being shoved down your throat every second
@the boss wolf  the first wonder woman was good. the second one was trash .
@catherine d orian somehow. they re starting to follow the  trend  sadly. it may not be as egregious as the west but they re getting there.
@norman readdis  ugh that sucks.. i was hoping they d remain the final not woke entertainment
@catherine d orian sadly no  trns aka ladyboi originated in thailand. some sea countries already penalizing  alleged   catcalling  and alleged scual harasment by jail time no evidence needed.singapore is the same.they do adopt anything that come from the west half a decade late as always.japan s gaming industry companies are now officially in the esg system.unless the west fixed itself the world won t and just follow what the west have. as much as i m not fond of korean entertainment specially the idol scene. i d rather have that than wokeness. lesser evil.
@norman readdis  that is definitely true.  i d rather have anything that isn t woke. ever since they ruined my lord of the rings  i want it to burn down!
@catherine d orian  cast it on to the fire tolkien fans have more standards than star wars and marvel dc fans combined. it literally ratiod amazon s fanfic series. lol evil can t create  it only corrupts .
@the real stephentv  this is why i said nope i don t want to see anybody s review for the wonder woman movie i want to see if my damn self and i love the first one but then the second one needed more work hopefully this third one if it gets finished is better than the second one i did not like the captain marvel movie you know the reason why i shouldn t explain
@scrat the squirrel megamind was a good movie.
@catherine d orian all hail the asians.and their anime loli women.eh
its ironic that wonder woman was created by a man who was into bdsm with his wife and she was the dom lol.
@norman readdis so are you neglecting the entire part of the star wars fandom that despises the sequels and rey and how they ruined stuff with wokeness and bringing palpatine back i am not even a star wars fan and i don t like the last one either.
@chandller burse  make sure those reviews of legit you don t even sucker especially for the latest ant-man and wasp situation recently there has been good female leads probably independent and just should not be forced you earn it now back to nightmare creatures something people don t know about
@chandller burse star wars  fans  is the reason george disown star wars.
@chandller burse  you know they said you re nuts it won t work boy was they shock and became a sensation i want a true female lead superhero is everybody just wanted to be wonder woman you don t believe me halloween this year see people dressed up just like her especially the halloween parade coming up in october
it doesn t bother me if there s a movie where a woman is  the bestest thing ever . how many movies are there where a man is the bestest thing ever  both are boring and unrealistic. neither are for me  so i don t watch it and don t get upset by it. it only annoys me when established male characters are made in to female characters because tv movieland is lazy and chasing a cheap buck.
@christopher loyd  what literally what you type like its a rap or something.
@christopher loyd  you re not making any sense still i do not know what you are claiming about me at all.
@chandller burse  this is what i m saying you can forget about getting another good star wars movie you can forget about getting anything good marvel as long as they would disney have you been seeing what the f    has been happening go watch ant-man and wasp quantum i m done and for the record i don t listen to rap up-to-date some of them yes and if you thought that was something wait to the marvel s come out i m going to go scream 6
@christopher loyd  when did i ever say i wanted to see ant man or any other mcu movie you ve made little to no sense til now.i don t want to see it or any more mcu.i don t care for the extended universe anymore.
@christopher loyd  you clearly haven t even understood me as much as i understood you.
@chandller burse  okay i ll say this to end it you enjoy what you want enjoy just ignore them even though they try to throw it in your f     face cuz when you ignore them that s when they get pissed there s an old saying been dead that s not the problem but being forgotten that s a b
@christopher loyd  my brain hurts from reading these comments.
@chandller burse  i guess we born in different timelines i was born when the rockys movies was around love rocky 4 that s why i even though he s kane in marvel i m looking more forward to creed 3 i hope you are to
@christopher loyd  rocky 4 was okay.creed movies are good i guess.but i am only there for rocky.also again your comments seem nonsensical and unconnected to the conversation.
@chandller burse  the conversation is quite simple you want this is people want to do make marvel and in general mel great again the only way that s going to happen if you all combine your money and it s somehow come up a way to buy them out imma quote duke you re going to go through hell to even reach that level anyting you melanie you re all going to have to have a sit-down group what the assholes and funny come to a tuition like a truce but i don t see it happening come on talk to my brother about this and he said disney and giving people    this is why everybody just gave up on them i try or just go back to mortal kombat that s where the real money is
@christopher loyd  why the hell would i waste money with other people from a random youtube channel audience i argue with all the time to make marvel good again we just end up fighting if we even could buy it.
@christopher loyd   how about i don t watch anymore mcu movies and also how about you take a writing comprehension class.
@chandller burse  you do realize once motal kombat comes up i don t give a f    what you have to say the conversation is over if you re online somewhere we can have this conversation on the stage i m not talkin no comprehension test it s called fatality
@christopher loyd  i didn t say anything about mortal kombat.
@hi  that s why the two classic somewhere to films and the last game underworld whose face is that angelina jolie s face isn t it this is why i figured she s the only good thing of eternals mine always known her for tomb raider i figured she should have did it and then pass the torch to the new you know i say nothing negative about jolie
for reference  see every character michelle rodriguez has ever played. i m so sick of them acting like this small woman can easily drop any grown man she comes into contact with.
buffy. need i say more. buffy was the bestest thing ever but she was also a woman with all the failings and strengths of womanhood. so i don t think it is actually the  bestest  thing you are objecting too. it is the lack of vulnerability in the female characters. what is really sad is that vulnerability is actually the strength and the relatability of good female characters. it is what makes them human.
@catherine d orian  well  murican stuff. that s why i rather watch european crime shows on netflix. sometimes there is woke crap  yes  and not all characters are super likable  just human.
@borachon26  100  agree. i prefer media where humans actually behave like humans.
@thisgalsal  nah  vulnerability is a human thing  writers just aren t good at portraying how the two genders handle it.
when did he say that
is that in the director s cut of back to the future also companies are not gonna wake up but they re learning the overton window. they re now putting good ip with signs of the agenda and people will consume it regardless. tlou hp legacy.they don t need to he successful nowadays a fair amount of sales is fine because they re aiming for that esg score.they ll drop that off if no one  can t stress this enough  no one buys their products no matter how  goo d  it was.
@norman readdis  actually  it was in the bible  chapter 3  verse 11  the gospel of poindexter.
if you re gonna quote someone at least get the person behind the quote right  everyone knows that shakespeare said that
this pandering appropriation of doc brown is more cringe than some of the woke stuff.the only thing worse than this is rick from rick and morty.don t do my boy like that.
@highbudget everyone knows it was eggman who was actually real.
been happening all throughout history. exploiters gon exploit! low iq and zero confidence. get  em tiger
no  not at all. the cool kids are still the cool adults now. they are the ones who grew up and transitioned into productive members of society. the garbage that s invaded your spaces are new age nerds  geeks  and dorks. however  they are not the smart kind. they are the mentally stunted kind. instead of helping the mentally ill  society has decided to encourage and enable them. the cool kids never wanted into your space  they have no time for it and are busy with real life hobbies and real life situations. they are social and handle things head on. they are not  introverts   they are not shy  they aren t cowardly  they don t hide away indoors  aren t afraid to go out and talk to people  etc etc... do not confuse the cool kids with the  woke  kids. the  woke  kids are who keep invading your spaces and they are the ones who treat you badly. cool kids will either treat you well because they can see the value in you or they will ignore you completely because you re a waste of their time.
@k1n63d  well  our experiences have been different. the nerdspaces have been infiltrated long before anyone said the word woke.and don t confuse the cool kids and the bullies.
@greyman1104   long before anyone started using the word woke  so according to you  the nerd spaces have been invaded long before the 1930 s  woke has been around for a long long time. always ignored  laughed at and ridiculed for its stupidity.
@shadowwolfqc  actually you are referencing a trope stereotype from the boomer generation. that s not how the world has worked since the late 90s and early 00s.
i was always a nerd in school  i ate lunch with the nerds  i hung out with the nerds. bullies never got any traction with us because i was also a jock. i hit puberty early  6 1  180lbs  5  body fat when i was 12  captain of the wrestling team and the flanker on the rugby team  football  think linebacker . outside of school i also played aaa hockey  i was very busy.some kids tried bullying us  never really worked because i just laughed at them. one person slammed one of my friends into a locker once  he had a disability where he couldn t walk straight and had apparently been getting teased by the guy. i took him down and explained why that s not acceptable. those kids all grew up to be woke a holes.
@k1n63d  are you calling introverts cowardly and like to hide indoors  i mean i consider myself and introvert  but i have self confidence and go to the gym and enjoy my sports or  real life hobbies  as you put it  also don t confuse cool kids for being socially gifted  a lot of the times its just a front to act cool because they are nothing near cool  catch my drift champ
@k1n63d  bruuhh wtf did i just read  cool kids are equiped to handle real life situations and everyone else is mentally stunted  i mean i ve read alot of crap on the net lately but your comment takes the cake
@achilles8530  no. i m not. that s what you are saying. like i told the other fool. try reading what has been written without adding any of your own assumptions. learn what commas are and how they are used. periods too. basically try to review basic grammar once in a while because obviously these days many tend to forget the rules of grammar because they think they already learned it as a kid. if you think that about introverts  you are incorrect.
@bladefury9882  you read what i wrote. how you got lost and confused as you read it is a testament to your own education. or lack of.
@k1n63d  you do come off as a condescending arrogant little punk    the cool kids are still the cool adults now. they are the ones who grew up and transitioned into productive members of society  really  that s a bit of a far reach nonsense thing to say
especially if they re the athletic  dark-skinned  short messy hair with abs type.
@k1n63d  i didn t even know that! i heard the term for the first time maybe 10years ago. thanks!
@grey man  np
yeh i miss when nerd stuff  wasn t cool  tbh. it was more meaningful back than. now it s all so shallow.
this sounds like an elaborate way to say you re an introvert.welcome to the club its sometimes depressing and sometimes lacks women.
@k1n63d i mean some of the cool kids ended up on drugs or in strip clubs lets be fair.
@k1n63d this also feels like an elaborate way to say you never got invited to eat at the cool kids table and are still trying to do so.listen its happened to all of us.except me i don t even think there was a cool kids table nor did i give a flying hell.
@k1n63d woke like todays woke was a thing in the 30s
@chandllerburse737  yes  some of them did end up that way. there s always outliers  only a fool would think in absolutes. the majority didn t.i do want to mention that one shouldn t confuse the cool kids with any of the lackies and randos that hang around them to try to get cool by association.
@chandllerburse737  i don t know what kind of made up stories your imagination comes up with. whatever you come up with is irrelevant and a waste of time. passive aggressive insults while trying to make yourself seem cool... damn that s cringe.
@k1n63d  i don t try to make myself cool i hate myself why would i  lol
@chandllerburse737  yeah yeah  irrelevant nonsense
@k1n63d  oh i agree what you said is irrelevant nonsense
@chandllerburse737  yeah yeah irrelevant nonsense  i know you are but what am i
@chandller burse  i so hate myself too and i have no idea how to stop this
@grey man  k
but please stop fighting  dudes. we re all just here to enjoy our hobbies. i only disagreed with king ed about the cool kids thing  because i was never bullied by the cool kids. they always seemed generally kind.
@greyman1104  so you completely agreed with what i said. how you understood the opposite of what was written is tarded.
@grey man  i never come here to discuss hobbies.i always argue because melonies audience like sydney watsons is hard to agree with.i hadn t been here for a little while but i made this mistake again.
@k1n63d  i never said i wasn t a tard.
@chandller burse  yeah that happens to me too often  too.
you summed it up nicely.
this is a really thought provoking comment. i am going to savour it for days as i think you hit on a hidden truth that i was not seeing. thank-you.
@k1n63d  yeesh.  you are trying way too hard dude.  just relax and take it easy for a day or two.  gettin  ratioed pretty badly in this thread but don t worry  we still think you re cool.  ok   all good then.
@chandller burse   lacks women   you do realise that women can also be introverted  even tend to be more so than men  right
@comedic sociopathy  i meant we don t get women
@comedicsociopathy4332  that s a lot of words to say absolutely nothing.
today society is saying women  and men  are the same when not.
not all women are extremely feminine  though. i am sometimes  but i also tend to be tomboyish. there aren t rules for how feminine or masculine we need to be  and i m not going to pretend to be a way i m not to appease anyone s idea of what i should be.
yes. there are rules to it. that s what s wrong with society. we can t accept the rules.
we are all humans.a very pathetic disturbing and odd species that is either slowly improving or slowly destroying itself so . lol.
@patrick henry  please state the rules that society can t seems to accept. just wanted to know
@woozy woozy  if you don t know the rules  no point in explaining them to ya.
@woozy woozy  i ll use an easy one... ready actions have consequences.
@patrick henry  that has zero relation to the gender issue though.if you want to follow some arbitrary societal rules like a zombie  please do that  but leave the freedom loving people alone  thanks.
@comedic sociopathy  has zero relation  ffs..
that s funny bro.
you hit the metaphorical nail on the head.
shippers are degenerates.
there are sort of both i believe
@soma gai i ship femshep with garrus fight me i will not lose.
you sniveling dorks are hilarious
just like i was told once how i played the mgs series lessened my experience.yaaay gatekeeping  sarcasm
@fclefjefff  what makes them dorks
hard men   easy times   soft men   hard times
as a woman  i agree. one of the best men i ve ever known is a strong manly-man with a strong moral compass. he s a rescuer who saves people and animals. that s my ideal.
@counter balance  i think people tend to mistake masculinity for toxic masculinity nowadays when those are very clearly not the same.
you are my people!
it s cackling! tomoxic feministity now. thanks wokies .
i think i just want the mcu to stop.like there is nothing left in it.especially for me except maybe spider-man but no way home may be the best we get.thor love and thunder was horrendous.ant man s sequels seem to be boring.dr strange 2 was forgettable.i just can t with extended universes i can t with dceu.just give me battinson and if michael keaton is good in flash maybe that but get the rest of this crap out of my face at this point.
women do make up like a very small percentage of gamers i think.or at least did for decades.meeting a gamer girl is just a fantasy and doesnt mean anything would work out and besides opposites supposedly attract.
i was one of the biggest gamers in the family but that never stopped my sister or cousin from picking up a controller and taking me on.only reason i think they d want games to go woke is so they don t hear ashley in re4 screaming for me to save her every 5 seconds.seriously though  bring back the gatekeepers. disney s been playing fast and loose with my star wars.netflix and i have beef over what they did to the witcher not even bayonetta 3 is safe   like i don t know what you re doing when you kill a highly sexualized character only to try to replace her with another character who is cringe as hell and flat as a board
@guerrilla gorilla  especially when a woman designed bayonettas character lol
yes same!
@melonie mac go boom  and i m also a pink fanatic.
@pinkcrystals91  i used to haaaaate pink! but i managed to make peace with it one day and now i kind of love it at times. purple is my color though.
you rich or something
@high road media  no. just happy to support her. i will always give what i can to support  her.
@high road media  no he s a creep
glad you re continuing to make your regular content and not letting anything stop you. love to see it. god bless you richly  melonie
thanks for telling your side of the story. growing up  my sister liked girly stuff like makeup  fashion  anne of green gables  cinderella etc whereas i liked playing soccer  drums  video games  batman  xmen  etc. so  an outer space visitor looking into earth might conclude  ok  someone like melonie must be lgbt or transgender or genderless or something because she doesn t fit my original idea that if you are a woman all women are into x whereas guys are into y. so lets make content for people like you showing women as men and men as women because we don t understand the situation.   but you are still a woman  a pretty woman   a caring woman  etc who also enjoys things so i am glad you can speak up for the women like you.  i remember being really excited to see x-men 1 and 2 in the theatres and i wish i could go back to those days of a child like excitement for things
the women taking over marvel movies just happens to match up with the movies going to heck. it s entirely a coincidence  lol. have a great weekend  melonie. your hair looks great
i think  pick me girls  was made an insult by those girls who just couldn t get a boyfriend. ps  your dog is cute.
i don t know if i would consider myself a tomboy per se  but i ve always loved playing video games and being into computers  never been a big fan of sports . when i was 3  my favorite movie was batman and my parents bought me some hot wheels from that movie  and at the same time i had barbies. i always appreciated that video games were male-dominated but they always put in cool female characters in games  like chun-li in street fighter ii   which they really didn t have to. it s always fun to play a video game that was not made with girls in mind  the nerd space has always been welcoming to anyone who wants to have a good time. anita snarkeesian and literally who didn t do anyone any favors and our favorite hobbies have been hijacked by narcissists. it s time to take our hobbies back.
7 00 - 7 16 you make an excellent point melonie. being a superhero is  was  and always will be a male fantasy. being super powerful and getting to beat up your enemies while protecting the world is something that is inherently male  because we as males are the protectors  the providers  and the purveyors of the world. women of course can be superheroes as well  there  absolutely nothing wrong with that  but for the most part superhero comics have always been catered towards men.
as a dude who has been in the nerd space my whole life  i have never heard one guy say   i hate it when pretty girls genuinely enjoy what i do.  never happened once.
winter soldier still to this day is their best movie by a landslide.
you have great points. as a straight white man  when i engross myself into any story i totally submerge myself into it. whether i am alongside he man or lion-o smiting evil or cheering on optimus prime to holding my breath as sara connor and ellen ridley manage to endure their hardships to the complex relationships that wonder woman  cara dune  princess leia and storm go through to exploring strange worlds with sami s aran  the big point is that these characters are written so well they feel as alive as i am. i have even enjoyed stories that are more feminine such as rio  jem and the holograms  and twilight. again great storytelling allows me to lose myself into these different lives that are totally different from me which escapism is all about  getting away from the real world!
amen sister melonie  as a man i grew up watching justice league  btas  superman the animated series and other dc comics shows and movies  i felt represented by both the male characters and the female characters especially wonder woman and hawkgirl  and stephanie brown and barbara gordon.
i haven t decided to identify as a female tomboy yet  but if i do i ll definitely come back to this video so i can relate more.
thank you for the video melonie. i to never understood why people want to see themselves depicted in entertainment. i already live in this mortal shell. i already experienced this mortal shell. why would i want to see my weak  insecure self from a different point of view. i want to see a different story manifested.
i love how the dog just came in by the door to chill. 3 02
the worst is the double standards  they have practically deleted every trace of everything even remotely sexy with female superhero characters  like with black widow that even in her own movie made fun of the sexy poses she used to make  but we can have jokes of how perfect captains america s ass is  a penis joke with the hulk or a joke where thor gets practically naked...
i m rewatching the walking dead right now and just finished the  all out war   era and i gotta say it is so refreshing to see masculinity portrayed by men in the show. rick  glenn  abraham  morgan  carl  even father gabriel was honestly kicking ass. negan exudes the same and man i am so afraid of what will happen to negan when he goes with maggie to new york this summer. i already know the mary sue will come out with an article titled  negan  his bat isn t the only thing that swings both ways.  and i mean ship whatever you want  but don t make that his focal point. rick grimes focal point is not that he loves the women he s had in his life from lori to jessie to michonne  its the fact he is a great leader  does what needs to be done  and fights for his family to survive. tbh its also so touching to see a man be uber masculine but also dote and love on his son and daughter. which is also sorely lacking in hollywood now. can t have a man being a good father.
we don t want it  well said! i grew up with two brothers and preferred them to my female friends. we like men  if they want to alienate us  treating male characters badly is sure to drive us away.
i agree. it s a huge problem. it has a lot to do with comparing people. because if you are insecure  you compare yourself to others. especially respected and secure people. even fictive people.  real  heroes. so if you have a bunch of insecure  beta male writers and directors  and self centered women  who write themself into the stories  they either genderswap men to write themself into the story  or they downgrade feminin women  or they downgrade masculine men  so they look better in comparison.if you are a bit more secure and a physically beta male  you see the strong heroes  and it encourages you. you say to yourself  you can achive that  too. some of the actors really are cool guys with a lot of muscles  good guys who care for others  so you can compare yourself to them and see them as an inspiration and what they have as motivation  because you tell yourself  you aren t a useless and lazy clown and can improve  can have a goal  can work for that and can reach the goal. comparing yourself to better people feels bad  and you can do something about that  and that s the healthy option.but if you are weak minded  useless and a lazy clown  you sabotage better  stronger and more successful people. you are weaker  so you have to group up. that s what happens a lot atm. and if it s about superheroes  they compare themself to them  and see  the superheroes are superior. and they can t say  it s ok  it s fantasy. they can t see it as inspiration or motivation  because they are lazy. so they downgrade them to look better and feel better. that s a huge part of what is going on in entertainment atm in short
so glad to hear a real woman explaining this to the world.  thanks
tomboy here  though i love expressing my femininity too. bring back manly men! if not for me growing up loving marvel  dc  videogames etc. i might have become a crazy liberal like so many in gen z. because they actually taught me the value of masculinity in men  and let me appreciate that while still recognizing the difference between men and women and how we both have our unique strengths. it s such an important lesson to learn as a kid.
i never understood how being a  pick me girl  is an insult as opposed to a bitter and angry girl who hates men and then wonders why men won t date her.
it s not women who are the problem  it s political activists who use popular ip as a platform for their lecturing.
@genethemachine  darling. there movies are literally advertised to be made of  women only cast writers ...so yeah. these women are the problem.
it s just superhero burnout! i swear it doesn t have anything to do with our bad writing or woke agenda!
i mean  pick me up girls exist. just the term is used too much
nope you won t. is why when my husband met me on wow he swooped me up to keep me. lol he still says all the time how awesome it is having a wife who get s it and enjoys doing the things he does. lol
viva la dirt league did a skit years ago about a pretty gamer girl purchasing a gaming rig. it s pretty funny and true to life. us guys  our behavior changes as our brains go to red alert lol.
have you seen how cod players talk about gamer girls
@chandller burse  i was referring to actual real life.
@chandller burse  the solution to that problem is simple mute and block. which alot don t do but will gladly complain it.
@best name i can think of  gamers don t live in reality lol
@spirit of paradox  the solution to the problem is activision s bankruptcy and cod finally dying.a worthless series gone nothing will be lost lol.
@chandller burse  so true haha
same  the only ones who act like jerks are competitive games chat and they are toxic to guys too.
where cap literally is the alpha male  presenting very male characterisitics and personified true masculinity  the notion that masculinity at its core is protecting what is yours. your family friends  your country  your ideals etc.totally.  d
@drfunctional true
facts
yes!!! thank you!!!
i didn t want to like it at first because i just wasn t familiar with captain america  but now i watch that movie ever month or so. definitely worth rewatching.
i found it boringthe second of the individual hero trilogies have always been the least entertaining especially thor dark world oh god.
i have maintained this position from the first time i watched ws. no other marvel movie tops it in my book.
just noticed that cute
preach!
i thought the left was full of nerds and geeks too though also the idea that marvel saved someone from being a progressive leftist is kind of ironic with how progressive marvel use to be with xmen comics and black panther existing.but those were good messages done well.
@chandller burse  that s a fair point actually. i think maybe different people take different messages from films entertainment. me personally i was inspired by a lot of male superheroes and admired them for their strength  and i looked up to female superheroes around them for working together and using their abilities to help each other. for example  my favourite marvel films growing up were avengers  the first two captain america movies  thor  iron man etc. all of which had both strong male and female characters that inspired me. maybe i just took a lesson from them that lefties didn t
@jazbean  i like iron man because he is fundamentally flawed and broken in the comics but he still tries his best.something the mcu couldn t do because well alcoholism isn t something they want kids to see i guess.same for batman.they aren t 100  correct but they are human they cannot make things perfect.and superman is the perfect opposite he is perfect he could make things perfect.but humans are imperfect he would have to be a dictator and thats something he would never do.unless its injustice.
you are absolutely spot on melonie. there are no positive male heroes in modern movie s. i can t comment from the  tomboy  angle  even though my wife and one of my daughters would fall into that category. personally i prefer the term  girls that like cool stuff  but young boys and men need male heroes. when i was younger i wanted to be the hero  rescue the princess from the dragon and live happily ever after. boys need to have those masculine heros as role model s so they can grow up to be a protector  provider and the hero of their own family.
we can only like something if we see ourselves represented in it.   you re absolutely correct. idk when it became a thing that we have to know why we like something or have to have a reason to like it. sometimes you just like something  a person  a movie  a song  a game  etc  and you don t really know why and it isn t important anyway.  stone age  bronze age  iron age  stupid age.
yes we need more masculinity on comics and comic movies. you have the coolest hoodies melonie. stay cool or warm in this case
i love you melonie  you re the type of woman we want in our space. i fully encourage you to gatekeep alongside us. this community being so open and willing to be inclusive is what ultimately brought this ruin upon us. we had great people like you in the space and these jealous outliers wanted the attention you got  so they moved in and then started demanding everything change to suit them. it d be like if i went to a sewing circle  said it s too much of a pie fest and we need more frat bros chugging beer in the foyer. sewing circles are trash unless you re doing keg stands. if you don t let us haze you  then you re a nazi...betty! you old bat!
chris gores heart grew 6 sizes this day
i think girls like you actually are a great depiction of the word feminine at least to in this particular case.  you appreciate and are fascinated by the differences and interests men.
hey melanie! love hearing from you  gary  drinker and the gang! it s always entertainment centered around a very grounded point of view. where i once groaned at hearing the phrase  strong female character   i ve now taken it up as a challenge in writing my own protagonist  mioko. one of my highest priorities is to redefined this phrase through actual characterization as opposed to the cookie cutter that abby gave us in the last of us. don t let the nerd space get you down. look forward to seeing more from you so keep up the great work!
well said and 100 percent true. it s sad as a life long marvel fan that literally has a room in my house full of long boxes i remember being so excited we were going to get live action marvel movies now i don t even bother to watch them untill they are on tv most of the time if then  last i saw was dr strange 2 ughh   as far as so called gate keeping i never once saw or even heard of anyone being kept out that was interested in comics or video games before all this craziness of the last several years. hell everyone i ever knew or talked to was always thrilled to meet a new person male or female into nerd culture since we were the ones always getting bullied for liking it. anyway have a great day everyone i m gonna go read some claremont era x-men.
this is one of your best vids.  keep up the great content!
i am so enamored with melonie s untamed hair. it s beautiful.
fellow tomboy here and wholeheartedly agree! i bought that shirt from flagrant triggers in all three colors because i cannot stand what they ve done to the men in marvel  hollywood in general really . gotta represent the good messages. feminine tomboys unite! we need to stick together.
13 00 marvel female heros... i didn t read alot of the comics growing up  but my friend was really into x-men. so i remember reading a few stories about jubilee. she was always pretty cool to me. i d watch a movie about her and seeing more of what she can do. if i remember right  she teamed up with gambit a lot. that might be a great idea for a movie right there!  the gambit of jubilee !
-gatekeeping is a good thing. if you truly like and want to enter into a certain sphere of entertainment  you will ingratiate yourself to the community and appreciate what is already there. gatekeeping is to keep out people actually don t enjoy the hobby  but need something to control and find validation in.-i ve never enjoyed media because i  see myself  in a character. if anything  i ve appreciated characters that inspire  that motivate  that are badass. i sure as heck don t identify with most of the male characters i ve enjoyed in games or movies  but i find them awesome and inspiration. same with female. i don t need to be a lady to enjoy a well-written female character.-gaming got hijacked not just by imposters who want to hijack our hobby  but also by corporate greed. aaa publishers want cinematic games that hold your hand because it appeals to the masses  hence more sales. quite frankly  it goes back to gatekeeping. every hobby is best when it s not mainstream. mainstream dilutes everything.
anyone else notice that these strong female leads are physical perfection and film ready beautiful
anita rolled in and dropped a duecethey absolutely took advantage of nerd culture and the inerrant openness and kindness of said nerds. its actually pretty disgusting
great commentary  melonie. you ve hit the nail on the head. the  problem  with media is narcissism moreso than any other  -ism . the whole point of fantasy is to escape reality  not reproduce it in my own image.
great video  melonie! you re absolutely right! i never had any trouble enjoying the adventures of ripley  sarah connor or princess leah despite not being a woman  this sort of thing was never an issue at all.let s just hope the  wokewaffen  thanks  chato  will someday see things as clearly and objectively as you do!
your not alone  i feel if they keep going this way there won t be a franchise left
you young lady are a breathe of fresh air   you speak with a lot of sense   more power to you .
what you re saying regarding gender and seeing yourself fits with race for me. i saw aspects i respected or that were like me in people who weren t my race more than my own. honestly i never noticed things about that until people literally pointed it out to me.
1000  - i bought my husband  slaying the dragon  for christmas - which is a book about the making of dnd. he knows i love the dragonlance chronicles and he told me that according to slaying the dragon  all these veterans who served in afghanistan sent their medals to margret weis tracy hickman for writing the books that gave them courage - the dragonlance books. they are trying to make masculinity  accessible  but it isn t nor should it be.i never related to the term  tomboy . i armwrestled the best in the world as a child and we chased whacked each other with sticks. i was always covered in blood  bruises  and grass stains. my dresses were always torn  much to my mother s chagrin. i am just a girl who likes cool stuff and in no way  form  or shape am i a man nor would i want to be. i have way too much respect for men ... and women. much love to you and your family.
how many boosters did he take
@brett goodrich  ah shit  here we go again  i spat my water on screen. have a lovely day  d
@brett goodrich  lol
thank you so much!
i enjoy your channel because you say whatever you want! never ever let anyone change that about you! you re awesome!
i will never understand this business of  you can only like something if it s directly targeted towards you  and if you like it anyway  that means you re denying something about yourself . as a boy  i watched and read plenty of stuff that was theoretically  girly  - one of my favorite childhood films was  the new adventures of pippi longstocking   for crying out loud - but i never felt alienated from them because the leads were girls  and i never inserted myself in the girls  place or wished i was one. i liked  em for the stories and characters and adventures and funny stuff  just like i liked the more boy-centric stuff i also read and watched  i wasn t thinking  why not me  or  this is me . if you need to see yourself in things all the time  you d do better investing in a whole lot of mirrors.
as a girl who also grew up with two older brothers  i completely agree with you. in terms of my favorite characters  i do lean towards great characters who happen to be masculine men   feminine women. i m sick to death of woke ideology ruining entertainment   it s turned me off so much. genuinely now more than ever because of this  i support male actors i like   good male characters since there s a war against them specifically.
have two sisters and have many girl cousins i hung out with yet still ended up a tom boy and preferred male character lead stories and my idols were and still are male characters. i m a daddy s girl and he introduced me to clint eastwood movies and stephen king books. everytime i play open world games i play as a male and prefer male game characters. i pretended i was luke skywalker when outside with friends and had a crush on captain kirk. saw joel as a father figure and refuse to play the new game as i know how it ends. it saddens me seeing the things i love get taken for granted and re-written.
would love to see more games in the contra and tmnt realm of difficulty. they were brutal  but so satisfying once you beat them.  get good or start over  should make a comeback.
hmmmm  this is interesting. growing up in nerd culture i definitely felt a lot of sexism and did want to be see as an equal in the space. because of my fem voice when playing video games people wouldn t want me on there team  which reminded me of sports in school. i always felt like i had to prove myself  it definitely felt like a disadvantage to be female which doesn t feel good.. and this is part of the reason i left a lot of nerd culture  i probably would have wanted to stay if i was accepted for who i am. i really did enjoy when there was female representation tbh  and i don t think that s egotistical. i just loved cheering on someone fem to look up to! someone i can relate too! but i can see your point about when it s done in a non-authentic way and just to virtue signal. i think there needs to be a balance . i wonder what this could look like
i wish they gave the shield to bucky  it would ve completed his redemption arc and steve could ve been with him symbolically.
great video melonie! one of my friends keeps saying how important it is to see more female superheroes... and i m like... dude  i miss when heroes were about their morals and deeds  not about their gender.
i approve of this message. very well said!
amen. phase 4 gave us a female loki  a female thor  a female hawkeye  a female iron man  a female hulk  a female black panther  a female captain america  a female taskmaster for some bizarre reason and three gender-bent female eternals. they gave us a shang-chi movie where the girl was the better fighter  a dr. strange movie where the girl was the stronger magic user  a loki show where the girl was the smarter trickster  a hawkeye show which was really about three other female characters entirely  a black panther movie that could have been named  5 black women who aren t black panther   a black widow movie which was basically just a metoo propaganda piece where the only male characters were a simp  a deadbeat dad and a cartoon villain and on and on it went. the m-she-u indeed.
great female leads in video games  cate archer in  no one lives for ever . nolf 1   2 were great ego shooters with a lot of comedic value. my wife hopes that one day they will make a new one that is faithful to the earlier games. if you melonie  never played those  you have to try to get them now.
you know what i call a tom boy when she s all grown up  a strong feminine woman. not like these weak insecure chicks we got in hollywood right now  insulting men and complaining about everything
girls that liked  boy-targeted  media liked it for what it was  there was nothing that needed changing- because we already liked it! it s one thing to have female characters  i mean  superhero media always had those- but it s another to completely butcher something we liked to begin with just to  appeal  to us- like wtf that s so damn annoying...
thank you  melanie  for reminding me why i love women  keep up the good work!
i have a little sister  same age as you and she ended up being just like you. i think too that growing up with 2 or more big brothers and no sisters makes you appreciate more boys  hobbies.
melonie is really growing on me  most women claim to be nerds. you can just hear it in her voice she s a nerd.
my mom who was born in 1957 have been a huge superhero fan and she passed her love of comic books and cartoons to 4 of my elder brothers whom then passed it to me  the last daughter of the family. we even have this huge comic book collection from the 60s and 70s at home. these stories used to be about the struggles the heroes faced and how they overcome  those struggles and bring hope to the people and to a certain level we could relate to those stories and the struggles which made the characters loveable. but now we just get overpowered female characters that seem to not have any flaws or character development and weak male characters who are just around for comedic relief also without any character development. watching superhero movies now is just annoying. i finally lost it when joker got pregnant
everything everywhere all at once was done very well. give these women leads their own movies and everyone wins.
before nerd shit got mainstreamed it was a niche and everyone was welcomed as long as they respected the neche  its what made the thing cool to us in the first place but when beople come in and tries to change tings to suite them personally  thats when we have a problem and now we have to gatekeep our ips. may the sentinels pure of heart stand vigil at the gates so that the rest of us can enjoy what we love in peace.
at 7 06 she lays down the best point i ve ever heard on this topic because she s absolutely correct being  the hero  in a story is predominantly a male fantasy
bucky never wanted it though. honestly falcon didn t really either  big shoes to fill. he ll probably lead the thunderbolts though
@nic bell  bucky in the comics struggled to live up to steve s legacy  so he decided that he wouldn t try to replace him. he made it his own. that s why he used a gun and changed the costume. but he still tried to represent what captain america stood for. but he never really was able to escape from his past  in the end he was put on trial for what he did as winter soldier. he stepped away from the role as captain america. that could ve made for an incredibly interesting movie. they pushed bucky out of relevancy  despite him being such a huge part of the previous films. feels like he was forgotten. wasted potential.
@david martinez  bucky is essentially jason todd anyways and i hate it when any of the robins take on the bat mantle.it shouldn t be theirs because it is bruce.it is who he truly is.it is his brokenness and obsession.
@chandller burse  i agree  but also disagree because of how essential bucky taking the mantle was to his arc in the comics. he redeemed himself. why i liked his character so much. it would also play into cap being with him to the end of the line  symbolically. red hood wouldn t be next in line  it s always been dick grayson. taking up the mantle of batman wouldn t make sense for jason todd character. his character was his own  even when he redeemed himself. whereas bucky isn t the winter soldier  he would need a new identity to try to move on from what he did. it mattered  especially in the eyes of the people. in the eyes of the people  winter soldier is an assassin that killed an lot of people. that identity is forever tainted.
@david martinez  dick shouldn t be batman either its even worse for him.he is suppose to be a mentally healthier and better batman.thats why bruce is proud of him as he is.dick should be his own man not pretend to be bruce.this is why terry mcginnis is good as batman because he is a different one he makes it his own.he acts serious sometimes sure but he isn t emotionless or stoic completely.dick however when he takes the cowl he pretends to be bruce.because he feels he has to.when he should just be nightwing.
@chandller burse  yeah  i agree he is much better as nightwing. i was just saying that dick is usually the one who s next in line. terry from batman beyond is a much better comparison to bucky because he  just like terry does with the mantle of batman  makes the mantle of captain america his own.
someone give this woman a medal and a cookie.
i agree with everything you said especially with the tomb raider games. they never forced woke ideology bs onto people. i don t mind a female character as long she s written really good and not using her identity woke forcing trans lgbt bs and others. we live in a world now where they force that woke bs and then blame everyone else except themselves. you ve earned my support
i took ballet classes growing up  but i also played video games  watched wrestling with my dad  played with the local boys in my neighborhood with toy guns  tree houses and pretending to be power rangers while fighting a snowman army. i rarely wore shirts because i didn t want to worry about flashing people. i wore jeans in the summer because i was trying to hid my muscular calves and thighs from years of dance classes several times a week. i group up knowing i was a tomboy despite my love of dance. i loved doing both traditional masculine and feminine activities. i m now an aesthetician. i work in the beauty industry  love playing with make up and doing nail art. i go camping with my friends in the summer  play both video and board games  love scented waxes  reading romance books  listen to kpop and watch hockey.i never seen myself as anything but a woman despite being a tomboy. if anything  i believe it s healthy to dabble in both traditional masculine and feminine activities. it s about finding yourself.i don t think what hollywood is doing to women and men on screen is healthy for anyone. they re too busy playing with social politics and not focusing on making great stories  or even using the great stories the ips already come with. there s teaching people a lesson and then there is shoving it down their throats. great writing isn t spelling out the lesson like the audience are toodlers.
a great story can make fans overlook many errors but if the story sucks too nothing can save the property
make gatekeeping relevant again.
excellent video and a smashing opinion. well done!
melanie  how do you feel about the token chick archetype  personally  i was always most interested in playing whatever girl playable characters were available if it was an option.
the culture has changed a lot in just the past  8 years. melonie  you are really based and real.
honestly i would be happy with good writing and well done films.
i usually don t comment much under videos but your thoughts really struck me and i had to let you know that i really respect you and your opinions. you make it make sense. keep up the good work and keep standing up for the truth that these wokes try so hard to conceal. cheers.
got tomboy friend  now she hates going out looking like she likes because people think shes trans or something
i love seeing your dogs and cats in the background while you talk. so cute.
keep up the good work it s appreciated.
a guy with five brothers and two sisters here.  but my sisters really stepped up with running things and looking after mum when dad wasn t around.lot of respect for them.as for women in action roles  done properly yes. women have been involved in many wars in supporting roles throughout history  and yes a few famous spys in real life too.i d like to see a modern take on mata hari or or the female british  french  russian agents ect during ww2 for that matter.you don t have to be built like a tank to be dangerous. just clever  determined   trained and resourceful.mind you there are plenty of female action films we love. tomb raider movies  peppermint  underworld movies  resident evil movies alien movies  terminator movies. alien series of films had sigourney weaver ffs long before anyone else.
sounds like someone that really knows what she likes!  i can t agree more.
just found your channel  really good thank you! catching up on old vids n looking forward to new!   all the best with the weirdo stalker
i was raised with jean claude slyvester stallone arnold dolph longren jet li jackie chan. man do i miss action movies the director of john wick is keeping action movies alive with john wick and nobody but his alone out their
the mcu may have lost a step but and we all the agree the holiday specials been on point!
it weird the direction they went. i recall when disney bought marvel they said they had the princess line for girls and wanted something to draw boys to disney. now they pretty much back tracked on that with what they are doing with the mcu.
well said girlfriend!  continue to embrace your femininity - it is not a weakness.
the souls community is good at gatekeeping most normies stay away from those games.
well said melanie. glad you continue to speak the truth.
you hit the nail on the head  don t stand  narcissists  is a great message.
do you watch  the chosen   a genuinely great show devoid of identity politics  its about jesus and his apostles. crowd-funded and extremely successful show that just finished its third season.there is no replacement for great writing  and the chosen is brilliantly told story about an already established story!
i appreciate your content  melonie  i agree
this is why i like small entertainment creators over giant corporations. we can still target segmented audiences and everyone can still find something they like. the movies are so expensive that they have to appeal to everyone. this is why they re making entertainment  that once was for twelve-year-old boys  utterly unrecognizable.
puppy inching in for moms attention was so damn cute i had to roll the video back lol.
it doesn t matter if a character is male or female  it matters if they fit naturally in the story and that the story is good.  also  i don t know any men at all that are bothered by women nerding out with us and enjoying what we take part in.  i think they actually enjoy having women there.
make it female but make it a new character  and make it stand on it s own  while being good  like actual artistic work
fellow  tomboy here   always loved boy s stuff hahaha i grew up with two brothers and no sisters  so i know the feeling ha i got called a pick me girl because i replied to a man on ig agreeing with him about how nobody asked for the marvels film   this girl got so pissed at me lol calling me a misogynistic   pick me girl   etc.i miss the old mcu...
as an old anime nerd  i love your hoodie. respect.also  beware! the  modern  cult would actually call you  indoctrinated  if they heard you now xd
you look happier  keep on with that smile. it looks great on you! the prayers are being answered.
my mum was a massive tomboy and would collect robots and dr who daleks when she was a kid. that was back in the 60 s
this was an interesting topic. tomboys are cool. thanks for the entertainment!
i appreciate your sentiment  melonie. a lot of guys i ve heard argue this point  feel the need to qualify that they are fine with female action heroes as long as they are well-written  and then proceed to cite sarah connor and ripley. i love those characters as much as the next fan  and better writing would help in general  but if marvel is ever going to shake that m-she-u moniker  they are going to need more dudes  that are actually allowed to kick some ass.
check out the demographic break down of marvel movies on imdb. the movie with the highest female demographic isn t captain marvel  which was the supposed target audience . the marvel movie with the highest female demographic is thor. most of the women that watched  watched to ogle chris hemsworth.
nice death note hoodie! in regards to you bringing up adding female characters to existing video game franchises  like tmnt  rare did a good job adding dixie kong into the donkey kong country series. she was probably the most useful character. but i see where you re coming from. some characters get introduced just for representation purposes as opposed to substance and utility.
make marvel great again!!! hope the stalker court stuff is working out
loved hearing your perspective. i don t think tptb will listen to you us  but surely they can t keep ignoring the box office dollars.
i wish we could go back to when nerd culture was looked down upon  i d rather be picked on  laughed at  or ignored because i read comics  play video games and watch sci-fi then see all the things i love turn their back on those who were loyal to them and change everything to try and appeal to a wider audience and end up failing.
i think youre absolutelly right  i was nearly expecting antman quantumania to be about the wasp but no its about janet the previous wasp  once again they managed to suplant the male hero in his own movie  way to go marvel so much for phase 5 being so much better than phase 4
@steve mc lendsy  whatever you say i guess lol never been attracted to girls but ok
as a man raised by a single mother  who is a tomboy  i learned so many of my interests from her  martial arts  football  soccer  boxing  superman. that being said  she learned her interests from her time with her father. she was never confused about her gender  she just liked kicking ass  poetry and art  she is a tomboy and yeah  she hated captain marvel  hated the black widow movie...which speaks volumes.
i remember me and my sister switching turns playing i think with dolls or barbies then hot wheels or something. i remember me hating on the girly thing beforehand but when we actually started playing i d take it serious and ask my sister what i m suppose to do
hey darlin! nice to see you re not letting ridiculous shit get you down. i love seeing that face and hearing that voice while i m gaming.
i really enjoy your videos and i m praying that you re stalking problems are fixed
thank goodness for the john wick series for keeping masculinity in entertainment
you re a breath of fresh air mac
i always wanted to do that   but i m 35 and should really not act like a boomer  but i hope you have an amazing saturday ms. mac n cheese
yes! grew up a tomboy and realized the fly on the wall reality of the situation. nowadays i m super girlie but still love the same hobbies. i enjoy seeing super dude-dudes be awesome partly because they are the perfect complement to softer characters  be they other men or women . and having had a great dad i find the man-bashing propensity of modern marvel offensive. men have to have role models too that will become heroes to their family.
just imagine making a capable female main character  putting her on a hard position and make her fail really bad! then make her realize why she fail  learn and come stronger  and surpass her struggles by effort! like every male character in the first 10 years of the mcu ! that can maybe works! who knows !
great video - as i am some one who absolutely loves strong female characters - ahsoka  scarlet witch  100  not captain marvel  the most awful bland character to exist along side  what s her name  no idea  the valkrie from thor  oml  plz no  sypher belnades  alita  jinx  i mean  there really is a list and they are always my favourite to watch  i mean i am a guy  why the heck would i not want to watch an awesome female character .... who s attractive  and capable  i mean shock horror  call me predictable for being a biological male and subject to evolutionary biology  i 100  utterly despise the direction everything is going.  it s soulless pandering garbage instead of well written characters with an actual point.
they could make the greatest movie of all time  and at this point  i wouldn t pee on it if it was on fire.
im a man and i really think you are right. keep doing that good content
melonie the big macmelonie the big cheesemelonie the big mac with cheesedon t know why i felt the need to type this  anyone who gets that reference is a legend by the way
very good point about all of this nonsense appealing to narcissists.  so true.
well said! you have an important point of view. thanks for sharing this!
i m a 40 y.o. tomboy and have been one for my entire life. if anyone ever tries to convince me that i m not a woman he or she will be trolled to death and embarrassed.
i d love to see all the statistics from viewership numbers and income for past marvel movies  versus today s marvels movies and television shows. has their revenue and viewership held steady or is it in steep decline  because they are still making more and more without adjusting very much at all. so either it s stubbornness or they are making more money elsewhere
the issue  i think  is that the phenomenon of male- or female-dominated spaces didn t emerge out of a vacuum or coercive stereotyping  but out of a natural negotiation between what men and women appreciate and prefer most in the other across time. therefore  the phenomenon is not merely cultural  but a reflection of our fundamental differences. that is in part why phase 1-3 mcu was so popular  it appealed to both as many men and as many women as possible through giving room for men to display the qualities men benefit most from wanting in themselves  and that women generally enjoy seeing and observing most in men. when you don t have that  there will be less broad appeal  which is probably why phase 4  by design  isn t as popular.
awesome death note hoodie
i m definitely a tomboy. i was a military brat and most of the children were boys. we played war  climbed trees  jumped off of roofs  watched the three stooges  etc. i even joined the army. when i had my first child  i prayed i d have a boy! i did. i loved playing toys with him  watching all those great cartoons in the 90s. i want to see men! i don t want to see a feminist on the screen! i want a real man. my favorite movies growing up all had manly men  and some really great strong women leads  like ripley. i played d d  made model cars  leather working. never was a girly girl. i do love cooking and baking though. my husband lucked out  i don t buy expensive makeup  purses or shoes. never saw the point in buying expensive crap.
if it wasn t for her  i also would never have learned  art  or more importantly  the word of god. mama didn t raise no fool  as they say.
personally  i think the ideal ratio of men to women is 2 1  so about 2 3rds of the heroes are men. however  i don t think someone should go through and count each hero to determine if they got the ratio exactly right. that s too much like the checklists hollywood is already burdened with. just greenlight stuff they think people will like and let them cast whoever they want  then let them write stories that serve the characters and leave out the in-your-face lectures. we just watched puss in boot  the last wish and it was so refreshing to have a proper family animated movie.
wow  you are right on point. you nailed it.
im the oldest out myself and my siblings and i influenced my sister into liking male dominated hobbies movies  games  comics etc. she still has her feminine qualities and has her feminine hobbies and that is perfectly fine. she always jokingly says that its because of me she s into that stuff lol.
i was between my mom and my wife during that scene where captain america tried to stop a helicopter from getting away. they were oogling over evans like high schoolers all over again.
i don t have a single female friend whether right of left wing that watches these shows that are  made for them.  conversley a ton of my guys friends no longer tune in for any of these new releases  myself included . marvel ended  ironically  after endgame imo.
sometimes i m starting to believe the expression  all good things come to an end  to be true in 2023.
i don t know the term yanki tomboy or what it is based on  but based on my more than 4 decades of life and the gray hair that this has brought me  i can say with great confidence that i like to see women on the screen.above all  and keeping in mind the theme  comics women. in the case of marvel  the female gallery is so vast and extensive and above all well done  until the early 2000s .the gigantic problem is that the female characters that they have decided to present on the screen are the worst  marvel   carol danvers was born to be hated as a character  the most modern version  not the carol of the late 60s.ms marvel hasn t sold comics since  1  ironheart is possibly the worst marvel has ever come up with in its history.the mess that wanda maximoff has been since her start on screen  going from hydra experiment to witch  rewriting the character herself with each new appearance. one of the best characters to ever exist on x-men is a total joke.the worst thing feige could do was cast modern versions of the many beloved female characters and on top of that just use the names to instill his activist politics.on top of that the burlesque murder of mcu mainstays.i want marvel to go back to being male again  no. i want to see my favorite female characters done well too.but with the 3 and a half years of history of constant bombardment of bad stories and lousy female characters  it becomes inevitable to think about how good those 11 years of  well done  characters were  and yes  mostly male and want that to come back.
and again  i am totally agree with you . i want the male lead back  the good ones! i m woman  my favourite colour is pink  i love being more girly. however  i do love male dude  history  i can be related with them. i am a nerd greek girl and i do not feel represent by this  new age woke  sorry.
there was a point in time during the production of the a-team in the 80s that they threw the idea out there of adding a female member to the team. the actor george pepard who played hannibal smith not only said the show didn t need a female main character  since it was male dominated from the very beginning and one of nbc s most watched shows without one  but that if they ever did it  he d walk. they instead eventually added the character ernie to the team  a latino male  toward the end of the series  but never any recurring female character. pepard got flack for his statements but he wasn t wrong.
there s a reason that the one and only masculine male character in hogwarts legacy is everyone s crush.   slytherin forever.
they need to make good movies and i think you d feel definitely. captain marvel was lame and so was black widow.
makes me wonder if a movie like 300 will ever be made in america again games used to be notorious for being challenging and now they focus on story elden ring    hold my beer
there s a reason the stuff we ve made for a long time has the appeal it has. we re wired differently  and that s fine. but there s a lot we can learn about each other s psychology by being observers in this stuff. also  those manly men appeal to many women who find that attractive. but beyond that  a woman can learn a lot about men by watching this kind of stuff. like watch some war movies and you ll see it s not just about the violence and defeating the enemy. it s also about honor  duty  protecting your brothers and your family back home  etc. but this stuff gets called toxic. there s a lot to appreciate there  even as a woman.
i m with you and hollywood if forcing this on us  i watch the old school from now on
there s a right way to write female characters  just treat them as characters in a story instead of walking talking propaganda posters to promote the message. for example  mara jade from the old star wars eu was a great character without overshadowing the male characters but instead complementing them. i really appreciate your videos melonie  keep up the good work!
they made a huge miscalculation with please 4.  like you said this is a mostly male dominant market.  men see it for the fantasy  girls mostly see it for the eye candy and story.  you can burn money trying to change it in a year or two  but we just saw how it will end.introduce good content  one good female now and then  and may end with a good varied roaster.
nice to know that you can relate with this current situations
there have always been amazing female superheroes. marvel under disney just haven t been able to lean into it for some strange reason. storm was the captain of the x-men s b team. when scott left to  settle down  with jean grey s clone  madelyne  storm became the leader of the x-men. rogue in the comics was more badass than the rogue in the films. she could fly and was nearly superman levels of strength and damned near indestructible. people make fun of dazzler  but she was basically cyclops without the need for a visor. she could fry you with her lazers. shadowcat was actually trained to be a ninja  in addition to being able to phase through solid objects. speaking of ninjas  the telekinetic brit by way of japan courtesy of mojo  psylocke. another absolute badass even before she was body swapped. and that s just one comic super group.
well said  melonie. as the oldest of two little brothers  even i was into comic books   video games. i remember seeing sam raimi s spider-man and falling in love with it. i personally don t mind female super heroes  so long as they re not complete knock offs of existing characters. what hollywood   disney is doing is hijacking a beloved ip just so they can appeal to the alphabete narcissists who cry wolf. it s just terrible.
i remember growing up playing with gijoes action figures  nintendo  super nintendo  zelda  and megamanx on christmas. my sister played too. she was a tomboy. there were barbie dolls  but they were part of the fighting action too. those were times when friends just come over without calling and we all drank yohoo at the arcades. i didn t see tomboys to be like us boys at all  they were not manly or anything  i saw them as the very few cool girls i like hanging with when i was a kid. we liked the same stuff  except they crush on guys and start trying to look cute for them while i say eww. those were good times.
lol. its the same with my sister and me.when the mcu was getting started  she was proud to show off the comic knowledge that i had taught her over the years lol. she also despised fat thor haha
@best name i can think of  lol!!
@best name i can think of  she should see venom addicted bearded batman.but thats actually good.
who
black widow is better  from time of ironman 1 till her own movie. they just need a good script writing.
black widow is great is given a good movie script
valkyrie is the single most unlikable character in the mcu she is just not a likable character. black widow was a great character and i enjoyed johansson in the role  i thought she did a great jobs.
carol and monica   we have the power to fly  shoot lasers and tank everything. kamala   gum-gum giant pistol!
i d settle for just making marvel watchable again.
loved loved loved tmnt!!! i still love tmnt! i was disgusted when they added a female  of course i was also disgusted with the michael bay movies and nickelodeon reboots  but we don t talk about that  love your vids  melonie! broke my heart to see you upset the other day  i am and will continue to pray for you
awesome. well said. thank you.
you said it towards the end. men enjoy a female base characters without needing masculine prelims. so why can t it be left alone. it s nice to enter this conversation for short blimps of time because irl things are not looking good. america is losing everything that made it great and they won t let me leave ahhhh!
fellow tomboy here  100  agree melonie!
they need validation from an outside source for some reason.  in my opinion  it s because these people lack self-esteem and self-confidence and sadly can only feel any sort of self-worth by  seeing themselves  on screen.
thanks for sticking up for the boys
it is a damn shame with how times have gotten
you are amazing melonie i completely agree
i m not a tomboy  i m a man who is a big girls blouse  but i want manly men who are cool.
i ve just rewatched ant-man   ant-man 2 - i never realised just how much he s sidelined in am2  it s night and day compared to each other.i loved both when they came out  but in am2 he s sidelined by two women that do it better than him - all he does in am2 is apologise all the time  i don t think he has a fight with the antagonists  the wasp easily defeats all obstacles put in her way - in the first film  sure she shows him some fighting  but in am2 she s dialled up to 11  how does a technology exec go from throwing a few punches to being just as good as black widow in the second film sorry if i m late to this one  but since rewatching i didn t really think it was that bad  but he s completely sidelined - what did he do   he looked like a whale and then became a giant to steal back a box  and played drums a bit.
i understand your view with the alphabet soup mob out there. people just need to people and stop pushing their views on others and getting pissed and trying to cancel others when they disagree. i agree with what u said.
so glad i grew up in the 80 s 90 s. i miss it.
preach it melonie. go woke  get broke indeed. it doesn t take much to see this trend.
i was thinking recently  dangerous  i know  that somehow the best writing was before the writers strike. maybe we should go back to scr wing over the writers and get better characters and stories. i suspect that the new shows abandon the source material because writers want to make a name for themselves and they think they need veer away from existing lore to do that. add on top that they have been brainwashed with the wokeism and you have mess we are dealing with now.the studios use established franchises because they always have a built-in fan-base. but then they let the writers go in and muck it all up  basically reversing the entire point of using existing material. if only they were creative enough to use existing lore but make new stories. star wars rogue one was a perfect example of this.i recall battlestar galactica was famously good writing. initially we had to adjust to a female boomer and starbuck. but the majority of the scifi fandom swallowed it all hook line and sinker. heck  starbuck full on smashed a guy  in the face   in the first episode and it was realistic!  limited series  number six and president roslin were strong characters. i don t think the show could have been as good without tricia helfer in all her various number 6 characters.
my wife agrees with you. she mostly watches programs with men doing manly things. she s not interested in female super heroes at all. sbe wants the eye candy.
ellen ripley will always be the gold standard female action star. neither too masculine or girly. just a character doing her job and being real
i always thought hercules and xena knew how to do this way better than mcu
men are not really allowed to be men in media any more. today men are seen as bad  jokes or a target to be hated on. you can even look beyond marvel and see it.things like this and id politics is what keeps me away from a lot of what i liked. clown world is getting to big for us normal people.
keep up the good work love you  3
make marvel male again... let s hashtag     that.  makemarvelmaleagain nothing wrong with female or minority  leads just not at the expense of everything else. critical drinker just recently did a video on this and said it perfectly and articulately.by the way love the channel just recently subscribe.
what they did to ol jade jaws was egregious and unforgivable.
this whole entertainment mess is orchestrated. they have simply allowed it to happen because they answer to someone with a lot of money and feel beholden to them.
thus hijacking of marvel and dc has caused japanese anime to start becoming more mainstream. ive been noticing so many more of my friends start diving into the world of anime and manga since marvel and dc have been turning woke as all hell.
i think when they inserted a female ninja turtle was because of they were trying to get into the power ranger slot which always had at least 1 female.
caught you on simpcast last night  and i agree  you need a bigger dog trained for body guard work. you guys brought up mastiffs if you were talking about american bull mastiffs it s an excellent bread for the work. but they have their downsides  they are very stubborn and require constant training from day one and they do not get along well with other dogs. outside of that they are big  210-220 lbs big  they drull a lot and shed a lot  but they are natural protectors and defenders of people and are dead silent  they ll take out the ops legs stand on their chest and just stair at them without ever making a sound instinctively.would recommend routweilers again big dog 90-120 lbs big  drull  loud barkers  lots of training for attacking  very loving and great with children german shepherds are solid  very intelligent  easy to train  shed a lot need a decent amount of exercise  pretty loyal 80-110 lbs bigoutside of that i would recommend 2 additional personal firearms for yourself s w snubnose .38 5 or 6 shot hammerles or hammer guard as a back up but is only good for close range and a derringer.38 2 shot it s a better than nothing classification but very easy to cary on your person but ment for extremely close range.but definitely get a guard dog
yes actual manly heroes back would be fcking nice
steven grant is a great character too  imagine him chillin with tobey maguires spider-man. that would break the multiverse yet again
once upon a time arnold was on a talk show. the host decided to stir up a little drama and asked them women what they think of his muscles. to arnold s surprise  they expressed distaste for his physique. one of the women even said she preferred the host s pigeon chest to arnold s. arnold answered with a sly grin  but look where it is coming from. i have 20 women a day at my hotel chasing me. do you think if any of these women stayed at the hotel they would have 20 men chasing them each day  . he then ripped into them and spent his time bragging about his popularity with girls. after a while he delivered the coup de grace and said  remember  unfeminine women are uncomfortable around masculine men  and these women here are abnormally career oriented
5 23 they re not targeting anybody who already likes this stuff. they re banking on us continuing to give our money while they target everyone who wasn t a fan before. this is why they re lazy about it. they know they don t have to do much to get the shares and retweets from the woke mob. they also know that the majority of fans aren t going to put effort into finding something new.i think that s part of the problem too... too many people are holding onto these properties that aren t what they used to be. star wars was my release point. tlj made me realize that they re not even trying to keep us fans anymore  they re targeting other people. that s fine with me. i ve never needed any of this. none of us do and we can find other things to spend money on and enjoy.
hollywood disney needs to go back to creating and showcasing amazing heroes who we will never live up to... not being able to see yourself in a hero is not a bad thing!
there is a reason metroid prime remaster is selling blockbusters. you can make a woman badass but feminine at the same time. even in the modern games in metroid dread they made her look even more feminine in her suit and both men and women loved it.
i love your opinions there so true
it would be cool to see a captain marvel movie don t let world get ya down  melonie
yes please!!
i ll say i also like fictional feminine women in games.samus aranjill valentineclaire redfield they re pretty  but what i love is they do not talk about feelings in hallways as nerdrotic would say  they also have the base intelligence to be strapped at all times.
i agree with the title make marvel men again. give us back our manly strong masculine heroes
thanks to your opinions ive subscribed to your channel
when dei becomes more important than the mission.....
well the game is also heavily praised for ages toosamus in dread had some moments where she acted very confident like when she instantly drops her guard when she realizes she s fighting kraid for the 8293939 time or when she slowly walks to shoot a boss  and this actually only makes her even more baddass than she actually is  nobody complains about that because samus is awesome and strong
samus never talks at all  isn t she like stoic because of ptsd
@chandllerburse737  beautiful thing  she doesn t talk about it. i ve no clue  never been implied she has ptsd  nintendo are thankfully more simple with her than a westerm developer would be. samus is all in gameplay  woman of action.
tomboy here  great video. i agree with a ton of everything you said here! definitely don t need to be  seen  to enjoy things.though for your thumbnail  for captain marvel..there actually was a female captain marvel in the comics at one point a long while back. just to point out.
thank you mallonie mac for your reasonableness
save our tomboys!3 50 never thought about it that way  but you got it right. that s why you don t see tomboys in media anymore..
last night on friday night tights they came up with a new one make dc straight again. love those guys
i m done with all things disney  so i hope they continue to push the message and lose more money.
i relate to melonie mac going boom.
tomboys are the best. can take your jokes and throw them back  appreciate your nerd hobbies more  and as one of the wisest men has stated   i love a girl who can kick my ass.
everything she said
everybody forgets loki was the first of the disney  series to completely emasculate what used to be a really awesome character. he s all sensitive now because he got stuck in time loops where he got kicked in the junk forever until he repents  and the show insists female loki is better than him in every way. yet somehow  for a lot of people  marvel s best show!in movies  i think the mcu s first offender was eternals  and how they swapped who the leader of the team was  and in fact  decided that ikaris would be the twist villain instead.  whoops spoilers! f that movie   it s been so strange to witness  because the tomboys and women who are fans of nerd culture are not the same women who are getting these jobs and making these movies and shows. eternals  she-hulk  birds of prey  dc s not getting off the hook  all run by women who had no familiarity with the source material. they come in with their own  takes  and just butcher the characters- characters who largely have male fanbases because their comics were predominantly read by males. it s so ironic. they can t comprehend that she-hulk and harley quinn had more fans that are men than women! yet they get hijacked to become these male-hating characters. it makes no sense.
i want certified non woke checkmarks.
i think it was thatstarwarsgirl that had one great reply to some woke warrior who called her a pick me. she just simply replied with  at least i get picked.  of course there was no reply from the wokie.
tom boy here...and mother of two tomboys and two boys....how are all my tomboy family doing out there in the world   growing up i sure as hell didn t want any female versions of my comic book hotties. didn t need no females coming in out of nowhere who weren t already there. same with movies and tv. no female can rep me bc i am not a normal female. i m a gd nerd who loves men to be masculine men and the females to be feminine and stay in their lanes when it comes to male spaces.
i agree...and as you said  we guys like the female heroes and villians.....but to be their own. the female tropes are just annoying and feel forced. can you have a strong female  yes  i have a female character that is strong  but strength is more the muscles  it s character. look at alot of the mail characters  they dont start off the best  they work their way up  and earn it. lot of the femake characters just highjack male roles  and then claim they did it on their own...well  not if you are using the fame of the established character you aren t besides tomboys are awesome  lot of my gal characters are  and really didnt know how hard it is for one...i had a degree of an idea  like when someone sees a tomboy  the trope says that she is gay  cause she dresses and act more male like.
take a look at these two captain marvel and the waspat first they had long flowing hair which made them pretty.now they gave them buzz cuts and they look really stupid.also nice l parka!
i don t understand when it became so hard for hollywood to write good female roles instead of inserting them into male roles. they have 2 of the best ever as a template in ripley from aliens and sarah conner from terminator.  these were 2 of the strongest and most badass women in cinema history. as far as tv shows go we have the template of buffy the vampire slayer who was strong and a lead and still a girly girl dealing with girl problems.
i wouldn t call mac a tom boy i call her a beautiful need girl
your speaking truth  and i like it
the visual aesthetic of this video gives me saint s row 2 vibes! now i want to play it!
hey cutie!  just found your channel and i m very pleased with your presence and takes.   plus one sub!
i miss when winter soldier was jacked and a skilled fighter
this is why i miss fighting games. most of the good fighting games like street fighter 2  mortal kombat  soul caliber  tekken and dc universe injustice had both traditional male and female characters to play with. each with their background story and story arc in the game. i can t understand why the video game industry is making less and less fighting games.
we want the husbandos back!
i 100  back you on this
i think the deletion of the whole idea of being a tomboy is really sad.  being into traditionally male stuff does not make you a dude or dude-wannabe.  i have a good friend who is into fireworks  guns  and heavy metal while still being very feminine.   she s not into the more gender-neutral stuff coming out of hollywood.
i prefer manly men in my video games. marvel vs capcom 2 my main 3 characters were zangief  juggernaut  and sentinel - and it was awesome lol
it was obvious after infinity war the mcu was going all new marvel and i noped out at that point. i have enjoyed the dumpster fire it s become though  it s hilarious .
i love a good well written strong female    but these writers ain t going in wanting to write a good story and make it good and believable  they just want to put men down and punch us in the face and tell us you must like her because she is strong and brave. everything else goes out the window
well said  that woman  3
maybe it s because of the way i carry myself  but a few women assumed things about me that haven t been true ... such as inviting me over to watch the footy and drink beer.i didn t much care if it was code or not  and at least one girl took it as a rejection  but hey ... how about straight up asking me what i m into instead of trying to put me in a box the way people think characteristic 1 must also mean characteristic 2  3  and 4 is weird.
cara dune  is a fantastic character not forced wokeness
3 02 in case you re just here for the cute dog
melonie remember to drink water. hahaha thank you for the video. stay safe. take care. have fun.
i couldn t agree more.
i m done with this stuff. i am developing games with real men and women. currently seeking out the full dev team and have a composer. got to get this demo going to pitch to rockstar games.
they re not going to change.  many things are permanently ruined.  it was intentional and it was mean-spirited.  the only way out is to form new studios and create new characters in the old school style.
what we really need in marvel right now is non woker series n movies
she-hulk would work great with deadpool if you put ryan reynolds and tatiana maslany both in charge.  they d even make fun of the fact that they are both canadian.
justice for the tomboys!!!
let s make tomboys great again.
when the heroes are well written  we want to be like them regardless of external characteristics. man  woman  animal  or robot shouldn t matter as long as they are overcoming their flaws and working for good. i never had a problem seeing myself in a good character until the focus was on their color or sexuality rather than on their journey or personality. one of my favorite scenes was black window being interrogated at the beginning of avengers seemingly being tortured while the whole time being in complete control  which they essentially replicated with loki  showing that she was very strategic in her actions because she didn t possess the abilities of some of the other avengers. who wouldn t want to be like that  man or woman
what ! no wolverine  lol
except mcu constantly has the issue of the villains trying to improve the world but they do it in an extreme way and the heroes just brush it off.
@chandller burse  true. but  improving  the world by subjugation or at the expense of freedom of choice is not a good thing. thanos could have easily remade the universe with abundant natural resources instead of killing half of life  except apparently plant life
@fidel perez  i literally just said that.when i talked about the villains doing it to the extreme.but the heroes never used it for that either.
tell that to minorities like asians and indians who have felt left out forever
m baku is the last of the manly man in the mcu.
not well phrased in the latter half  games always had stories  and story-focus... and were difficult
couldn t have said it better!
what they did to thor is embarrassing
a  when did the definition of pick me girl change  lol! it used to mean the only fan and fake everything ladies. i am always the last to know and i have no idea when this changed.great video.as a woman who has been defeated by ai since the vic 20 and has modded out rimworld to the point that it is essentially a farming sim and still hasn t won end game  bring back the men! men are wonderful  amazing creatures that i personally adore.there have been so many  diversity hires  that companies don t understand the essentials. women and men like each other. we really do. we really support each other and we really just like each other. as a little girl  i went to sleep at night trying to figure out if i wanted to imagine being in hans solo or luke skywalker s arms that night. bring back the men! i think we need to start a chant. bring back the men! bring back the men! if you are a man and reading this  we love you. f everyone who tells you we don t. we love you. we need you. and we are all better if you are there. f anyone who lies to you by saying different.
i m not gonna hold my breath. we already have so many amazing test fests we can look back on anyhow. nothing good is coming down the pike anytime soon. sorry folks
i m a structural steel fabricator and i work in a shop with two of the absolute coolest tomboys on the planet. don t get me wrong  they re women through and through  but they re iron workers and that makes them special.
make marvel like the comics from the 80s
3 02  my favorite part of this video. the bottom left  video bomber.  great content  melonie.
the dog is so adorable
speaking of a female ninja turtle they did bring that concept back in the concept. she wears a yellow bandana. idk how good it is cause i never read that run
no.. bring back the guys!!i more cool with male energy and had more guy friends growing up. i grew up loving the barbie dolls but i also had my voltron ninja turtles  robots etci m in my late 40s and still watch wrestling just like i did as a kid. loli grew up on playing games  comic books etc  but i want to see guys in movies. not just women as yes if it s done right but everything is forced.my husband enjoys the fact that i m down to earth and played video games. that was what we did when we dated. i don t like what s going on now in movies and it s a turn off.i was all in with every single marvel movie until iron man had his final snap  everything else is garbage.i just pray they don t ruin my spidey  that s my last saving grace.
my wife is a tomboy and we re a straight couple and she is like we re did all the men go
this girl tawkin tawkin  salute mac
growing up  when people wanted to  see themselves  in something  they d create fan-fics and call it a day.
i was following till 3 minutes in then your dog got my full attention
there s like no manly badass actors anymore they all over 50 now at least . i miss my 80s actions stars
i got bashed when i told a woman i would wait for wakanda forever to come out on the hallmark channel.
the neffex credit song was dope.
yesssss girl  tomboysunite
don t worry john wick is coming to save the day
pretty much every single male-dominated type of entertainment has been rebranded for wamen and lgbtq .  it s rather difficult to find something for me because of this  ironic because their main message is making things for everyone but that s simple not the case
i demand that every marvel character wear glasses. i want to see my impaired sight represented on the screen!!1 !
there has to have been some research conducted by some of these big companies on the returns they are getting now vs then. i personally view the woke crowd as being very vocal  but not willing to pay to  consume  what they advocated for.
i think hogwarts legacy showed the industry that you don t have to make a bunch of woke garbage to make a lot of money. and the companies out there that care more about money than they care about politics are going to be jumping at the gun to feed the fans what they want. that s what alita battle angel did for the fans when captain marvel came out. it was pretty much a reply to the movement that said that they only needed strong female lead characters and then alita the battle angel came out and showed that that s how you properly make a strong female lead character. and they did it without cramming politics down people s throats. that s the key is having entertainment differentiate itself from the reality of real politics. and no saying that there are movies out there with politics  i am fully aware of this and not arguing that. what i m pretty much saying is when you make all entertainment like that it takes the joy out of entertainment and the money as well. no money means no entertainment and companies are slowly realizing that going woke will make you go broke no matter how deep your pockets are.
your dog and cat look like good friends.
a lot of women i know have mentioned how there is a lack of male heroes in the mcu and how they re annoyed they don t give any of these female heroes and characters any personality and that they don t know how to write women
i approve this message
tomboys are the coolest chicks out there  full stop.
the comics have always had great female leads  but it wasn t at the expense or bashing or dumping down of the men. x-men is one of the most popular marvel properties and they have the best female characters working side by side with their male counterparts. in the 80 s storm replaced cyclops as team leader  but it wasn t at the expense of him. 90 s x-men was a great mashup of both. let both thrive  and not at the expense of the other .
thank you!!! i loved tony stark! he was my favorite. he s gone  not interested.
it s not that female characters can t be as good as make characters.the problem is that they refuse to write good female characters because they just replace existing characters with a female double who can do no wrong and has no flaws.
thanks for reminding me of turtle boobs again  i was happy i forgot about that
mikey  leo  don and rafe would be ok with a few more female turtles.
i m in my 40s and i was reading marvel comics when i was a kid  and they have always had strong female characters.you don t have to make strong female characters at determent to the guys. guys never had problems with female characters when i was younger. it seems fabricated to excuse bad movies and bad writing.
yes bring the dudes back baby i m all for it
another great video
3 05 sneak attack of cuteness!
awesome take you have in this video!
honestly just really want a good movie that doesn t push politics  agendas and ideologies. that s why hate when everything gets remade and gets continuations  except for samurai jack   because a lot of times they bring it back and it s either too ideological and or entertaining. very few shows and movies that have returned has been good  again except for samurai jack and maybe the final season of clone wars  mainly the genndy tartakovsky stuff .
my sister in christ you are damn right.
speak up and keep at it. the more people you reach the more and more people will realize that group the pander to is the 1  or the 1 . i haven t paid for a marvel property since spider man. i will continue to keep my money until they go back to the characters i liked.
and to think i assumed you were into females  also antman literally just came out .
this song has a nice beat to it
it is funny when i was 13 and a kid with low self-esteem  i was afraid of girls knowing i collected comic books. i didn t know they collected them too at the time. i concur. if they want some new fem boys in comics  make those characters  but don t emasculate the older ones.
you are a breath of fresh air! thank you!what they are doing sucks. i don t like the gender or the race swapping trend that s going on. even though i was expected to be more into black panther or luke cage  i was always a big captain america fan as a kid  and i m the total opposite of what steve rogers looks like  i don t have to  see myself  to like the character. i m a lifelong marvel comics fan and i supported both captain marvel and black widow movies only to be disappointed. there s good characters of both genders and it shouldn t be that hard to let everyone shine.
3 02  sorry  i couldn t finish the video  i had a cuteness heart-attack.
damn  you look so different. it s been 10 years since i ve seen your videos.
i saw a video that was attempting to be sardonic and it said   we ll make the lead character a male because everyone can relate to a male and only females can relate to a female   and i thought   yes  exactly.  a lot of girls will happily watch a male acting masculinely  but few boys will watch a female acting masculinely or even femininely. males naturally command attention and subjection. it s more harmonious to see a male leader and hero.make females feminine again.
3 04 - doggo hears  highjack  and does the hijax.
i really can t notice your l sweatshirt without sounding creepy but i like it and want to know if there s a light one for story reasonsand also the l one is really good.
yo this is what we need today and it s ticking me off i don t care if girl come in to these places but keep your pc bull out of it and just get in the boat but don t steer the captain  if that makes sense
your comment sums it up perfectly  mel. the gender insanity is psychology  any psychologist will tell you that both men and women exist in a balance between masculine and feminine. most of us stand in the middle and maybe teeter slightly to one side  but still say centered overall. yes  some will completely jump from center to the opposite side  but it s far and between.  interest does not justify and an entire break from manhood or womanhood  it just means in-betweenness.
love your view points
you may already know the secret behind the marvels movie poster
i love this lady! how bout a collaboration with jp sears
dont brake. u have great determination.
never thought i d be saying this but... i look forward to the return of sausage fests.
the best female character i ve seen on screen for a long time  is beth dutton from yellowstone.  now that is a strong female character!  she s a badass  she s sexy  she s insane at times.
two words  fight club.
i loved kim from better call saul. she is everything i hoped and more.
golden age of healthy marvel masculinity died with the original avengers... tony   steve - two archetypes of man to aspire for - killed off  bruce   thor before ragnarok were two sides of the tragic hero type  now turned into a comedic relief because they are very difficult to believably justify killing off   natasha was the archetype of a femme fatal that kept the toxicity in check and still took accountability for her actions  so of course she was removed and replaced . and clint  clint is lowkey the only one that was kept in-character post-endgame so far  even in the hawkeye show - yes  kate bishop as a prot g  is an attempt to replace him next  but not only he was never in the hero gig just because or for some tragic reason  it was always just a job he was equipped to do to provide for his family and keep them safe  so if he can just stop  step aside and leave the fighting to the next gen he is happy to oblige and live out the rest of his life in peace with his wife and kids...unfortunately i don t see marvel shifting gears for the better with their male characters anytime soon  at least with mcu looming over everything they own.
we love you so much.  remain honorable.
i am totally with you on this. i loved the marvel movies initially. the newer ones that have come out i swear i haven t even watched them. i have 0 interest. i don t care about thor s girlfriend wielding the hammer and all that other shit. i liked thor just fine. i have noticed the shit they are pulling with the woke ideology and it has just become ridiculous. in our games they are taking out genders completely which does annoy the hell out of me. they are pushing so much of this into our atmosphere and it is ruining it. have you saw the new 4400  i liked the original just fine just wished they would of finished it up. the new one is a great concept in certain ways but there is no balance to it. it feels over wokeified. you take a straight woman who was married and had a baby and basically abduct her and put her in the future where he baby is now a teen and within a week this straight woman who was married is making out with a trans man. really  i don t even know what is going on with comics. i have heard rumblings so i have just avoided it like the plague. all of this has irritated me so much. and i personally don t mind a trans person here or there in a movie or tv show or in a game but they are just over doing it and it just ruins it. and as for marvel yeah make it masculine again. women we like masculine men. it is built right into us to like them. we look for the strongest and someone who will protect us. so of course women were going to love thor and iron man and captain america. i liked black widow as well. she was a normal bad ass woman in there and that was fine. they didn t over play it or over do it but i honestly watched it for the men. as for games i have always liked fantasy style open world games. so skyrim  fallout  fallout 76  yes i know it sucked but it is amusing now  world of warcraft  final fantasy online  final fantasy on it s own. i have always liked playing a female but i played male characters too. it s ok though they don t want any genders in the games anymore. you are just an it. this genderless thing to make a small group of people happy. and that is the way it is going. i just want to blow shit up honestly and play a good game that isn t full of microtransactions.  i would love to be able to stream but i don t like the idea of being censored on what i say and am pretty sure if i just let loose i would be banned day 1. nobody should have to deal with that shit. everything has gone crazy and those without the opinion of wokeness tend to get the boot. it feels a bit helpless. here s hoping this crap comes to an end instead of ruining things further.
i was lucky to live through the sword and sorcery boom of the 80 s  which i was reminded of a while ago  when we lost one of the barbarian brothers.there were a lot of gym rats back then  whose acting chops may have been debatable  but who were extremely easy on the eyes when they were heroically underdressed.  even better  those movies weren t trying to be seriously cinematic cinema   they were just fun movies to watch  and apparently  they were fun to make  too.i miss the era of high testosterone  mediocre budgets  and barely-there costumes.  these days  it s all high budgets  mediocre costumes  and barely-there testosterone.
cool deathnote hoodie melonie!
it would be one thing if the inclusion of more women was more eye-candy and waifus.  but  the inclusion of more women characters along with less male gaze is the bad combination.  personally  i like when the badass man and the badass woman team up and work together.  i liked the secret of the sword intro for the vintage she-ra  plus any other cross-overs between she-ra and he-man.   it wasn t a passing of the power  putting he-man in the dustbin.  it wasn t a dumpfest where she-ra was shown to be better in every way.  both could be strong in their own way and when they worked together  they were unstoppable. i haven t seen anything like that in a loooooong time  and i miss it.
i was paying full attention until the puppy came in then i got distracted  soo fluffy!!
never really seen the comics world as manly. most characters are given special powers in some way or another instead of having to work hard to be powerful. pretty much why it s always been a dweebs hobby. perfectly fine watching it all burn itself down.
my ex and i followed mcu for a long time since the beginning. and she s a big nerd too she loves iron man more than i do. now when we talk about mcu phase 4 she s just not interested anymore. she hates captain marvel and doesn t like iron heart lol
as some people say   better a pick me than a pass me
in order to make masculine men again  and feminine females  they must be first acknowledged as the hard factual natural presets.which if the recent trend in video games has anything to say about it  isn t going to happen anytime soon with them  avoiding the natural boy or girl question when creating a character while having obvious presets for them. newsflash to the obtuse activist your own biological presets doesn t limit your video game presets it s the whole role-play part of role-playing games. but everything s a larp to them
in the meantime  it s always meantime.
yeah  spent my youth 80 s-90 s  being given hard time for being into games and scifi and comics. then it became popular and was stolen and turned to garbage. now i m told i m the worst for not liking what it has turned into.
the role of cara dune was made specifically for gina carrano  by jon favreau. not because she is a woman  but simply because she is a badass. me  a male  enjoying a prominent female character  i know  shocking...
clown world is a perfect way to describe it lol.
modern writer don t know or are maliciously indifferent to the fact that there is a difference between making a character strong because she s female and a strong character who happens to be female.
my wife and daughter prefer the male dominated movies and games etc...my girls love riding in my peterbilt  love riding other tractor on the farm  love outdoor activities etc
the crazy part is that men make up the majority of comic book movie  watchers  and comic book users yet corporate keeps trying to appeal to people who don t watch their shit or care about their shit. it doesn t make sense.
i remember during peak marvel movies.  kevin figie was pretty blunt on saying his goal was to introduce more trans   diversity  into marvel movies. no one seemed to be bothered though and were very pro marvel and wanting them to take spiderman from sony
as a guy i agree with you
well said!
the rule is simple men show up for good stories. they don t show up for abuse  only simps do that.
i m not sure there will be males left for it  not at least as we used to know them lol
to me  seeing someone not need to see themself in everything is real self-confidence. it s not needing validation in order to enjoy something. great video.
samus aran from the metroid series is another good example  zelda from tloz  princess peach  all good nerd spaces that dont need any of that ideology pushed on them
i agree with you 100  im a new sub btw
tbh  i don t have anything against female heroes  or villains  i loved hela   but they should pick popular ones and then make it good  i am pretty sure most people liked black widow more than hawkeye . if they want representation  why didn t they already bring alpha flight into the mcu. they now can use the x-men  enough powerful female members to choose from  they don t have to replace a male superhero with a female one that does the same  but better  kate bishop  she-hulk  ironheart . yes  i know that they exist in the comics  but they are not as popular. i hope they produce a good fantastic four movie. i would have been on board for a mcu hercules movie  but after thor  love and thunder  i am not sure anymore.
i don t think that they are trying to appeal to the girl gamers or to the tomboys. they are searching for a new audience. one that didn t have any interest in the nerd space before and by searching for that audience they are alienating their current audience
alot of movies these days are just trying to milk the franchise cause they know how many people will still go and see it. really watering down every form of content at this point.
they want to reboot starsky and hutch and make them women cops instead of men.....omg
let them pander and let them see if it pays off or not.
its definitely a west thing  because japanese have always had female characters in there games  anime and comics. from samus aran to sailor moon to casca there was always a space for female representation. i for one love samus in the metroid games. that being said i agree with you on why it was so male heavy on the west. the people buying and supporting the content is dominated be men so that s going to be the target audience. love your content keep up the good work.
melonie sounds a bit like kermit right now.
i m all for female heroes  as long as it s organic and well done. scarlet witch and black widow are perfect examples. besides  are there more male superheroes  yes. but also  look at most groups of superheroes  the female is typically the most powerful  fantastic four - invisible woman  x-men - jean grey  avengers - scarlet witch  etc. .
a train derailed at marvel and now it is clean up time.  my sincere hope is the multiverse plans are canceled or cut short.  i d like to see marvel rework the midnight suns to include one more solo outing with doctor strange  introduce blade in a solo feature and do the same with ghostrider and moon knight. i d like marvel to drop the mackie cap film and return him to falcon.  i d like for marvel to pull the trigger on a solo war machine movie.  i d like to see marvel approach the x-men from the stand point that professor x is getting old and he has been using his powers and the x-men for decades to erase knowledge and information about mutants but the snap allowed some hints at x-men in the world behind the scenes.  i d like to see marvel get back chris evans to do a limited captain america and howling commandos series that leads into a movie that explains why agent carter has a photo of kennedy in her office.  i d like disney to lite a fire under ryan reynolds and bring deadpool 3 to market sooner.   most of all i d like disney to remove the hydra from marvel.  it s all got to go.p.s. and i still think it would be far better for disney recast capt. marvel with yvonne strahovski especial if they can fit her into the movie story lines from comics where rogue takes her powers and war machine and her have a relationship thanks to them both being avengers and in the air force even if that is it for the character in mcu.  but if disney wants the character to have life they have to have an actress who will better connect with fans and her fellow co-stars.
tell me you have never read a comic with out telling me
i don t mind female lead movies  so long as the characters  the story and so forth are great i am totally up for female led movies.  take sigorney weaver as ellen ripley in the alien franchise and linda hamilton as sarah connor in the terminator franchise  they were excellent  well loved characters.
i identify  as a gamer nerd.
tx tomboys are  1 hands down
aeon flux was amazing  always felt the film did not do it justice  ghost in the shell was so good the matrix ripped it off  also the live action film did not do it justice .they never talk about men in romance films  i wonder why
they don t even have to  make marvel male again  just make the stuff with the women good!
quiet weeb
wrong  they always talk about men in romance film. they talk about how men are to blame when the woman cheated  and how men are to blame when the woman acts irrational  and how men are to blame for doing the right thing too late.
you da best thanks for the video insight.
yes bring strong males back
sometimes i think disney is using chatgpt to write its scripts. but then i realize nah  chatgpt can do better than that.
also  imagine being this fragile
it is very much easier to relate to a movie or game if you can see yourself in it  but it doesn t mean you don t appreciate things that don t directly represent you in some way. i can appreciate a female centric show or movie or whatever  but when there s obvious pandering it kind of ruins it.
nerd girls. where the heck was they when i grew up  nerdgirl power!
long comment. sorry. i grew up watching media and playing with toys that were considered boys  things and i started watching star trek when i was 5 or 6 years old. at around the age of 12  one of my favorite movies was  top gun . another was  iron eagle   air america   delta force   lion heart   you get the idea. i climbed trees  won fights  always started by others as my momma would ve flayed my backside if i started them  and just generally never gave a flying fig what anyone else thought of it. one of the only comics i read as a teen was  lobo . the other was  lady death . in my later teens  i hung out a lot with the gamer types  who i came to know because they noticed my habit of drawing star trek comm badges in my notebooks and wearing evil ernie shirts and reading sci-fi books. they were a great group of guys and i got into larping with them. our dm was intense about it and sometimes scheduled  side quests  in the middle of the night. i d sneak out of my grandma s house at midnight in the middle of february  michigan winter yo  and walk to keith s to put myself through the torture of wading in his neighbors frozen nasty pool with my friends because we were  hunting a monster  of some sort. afterwards  we all hung out in the basement drinking hot cocoa and talking about our session until the sun rose. i used to volunteer at star trek conventions just so i could be there. when i was young  i played basketball and street hockey. when i got older i got into playing the star trek customizable collectible card game at comic shop back rooms. it started at my local shop. i hung out there often and helped the owner stock shelves and tidy the store or clean the bathroom or run for food for him. he  paid  me with free stuff and food. i loved just hanging around the place so i was in the right spot at the right time when someone came to host a beginner session of the cccg. all that said  i never needed representation in anything i did. i loved maverick for being badass and for many years i wanted to be a fighter pilot because of him. i also wanted to be unwaveringly hopeful like luke skywalker and indomitable like leon in  lionheart . i wanted to be imposing af like rambo and brave like danny laruso. these may be intended to be power fantasies for guys but i took inspiration from them too. i didn t dress girly - except for when the mood struck - but i did still like doing my hair and makeup and coordinating my outfits  evil ernie shirts always required the black trench coat and black work boots  and i often modified my clothes to fit me in a more feminine way. i also crushed on plenty of boys. i cherished the times i spent just hanging out with the guys. it was always more fun and i honestly preferred their hobbies and company to the more acceptably  girly  pursuits my female peers would be into. i ve always liked this stuff and it grinds my gears when someone tells me i don t understand how oppressed i am. or they say i m a  pick me . i know they do it just to invalidate my input so they can  win  by default. quite frankly i find the women whinging about representation in these hobbies and who fling out  pick me  as an argument rather sad and pathetic. they ll never know the joy of being good at something and hanging out with others who like the same thing and having friendly competition with it. the day i took keith out in  goldeneye   he was the undisputed champion  when none of our friends could  even though i had to take myself out also to do it  is a memory i could never have had doing anything else and i wouldn t change it for the world. i once tried to explain all this to a woke clown and they just claimed i was brainwashed back into accepting a female identity  as if i hadn t just explained how i never left. i laughed and laughed and wrote them off. if marvel can bring back manly male leads  and genuine powerful women who aren t a total bitch  i d probably watch their movies again. but that s probably asking a lot.
i pretty much checked out at endgame. i still check out the tv shows  because they re more accessible. black widow s the only phase 4 movie i ve seen  and it shouldn t ve even been a phase 4 movie  in that it should ve been earlier .
yes  i know women that watch sports and they don t know the rules   they just like watching the men . or think they are hot . or just what to be involved in the game.  like they will cheer for a boyfriends  husbands   brother  fathers team.  and not particularly care . for the game.  and ask questions like what just happened    . thinking of the slide rule or the off side rule in soccer   football
back in the day  a couple decades ago  i worked and wrote for gw  warhammer stuff . back then we said openly that our hobby isn t for everyone. it isn t designed to be nor should we make it to me. sadly  it seems even the grimdark has faded. make an accessible product. but don t pander. that i believe would help a ton of companies these days.
dog strolls in   ah... she s talking to herself again.
for me it s not the use of gender in movies is the problem  it s how they write the story. regardless if it is an all women avengers  if the story is good  then everyone will watch it.
current female superheroes in movies are doing a massive disservice to their comic-book counterparts. they re nothing like in comics  people getting introduced to them are getting the wrong picture. storm and rogue are maybe my favorite superheroes  but i m afraid to see them reintroduced in future movies.
introduce your pets to us!
m-she-u is only a temporary thing  soon it will become the m-they them you starring spiderthem  ironthem  ant-them etc
rock on girl
i ve not bothered watching or playing anything that has an agenda attached to it. i m totally fine going back to older games and movies  shows..etc.   the more people fight with their money  the more they will revert back imo
this is what happens when you re creatively bankrupt. you take an existing property and hijack it. there s nothing wrong with female leads in games  classic lara croft  jill valentine  classic aya brea   or in movies but be original. don t replace a female thor with a male thor. plain and simple
marvel died after  no way home.   r.i.p. m-she-u
some of the most feminine women i know grew up tomboy  and the negative connotation associated with  pick me  is stupid  why wouldn t you want to be picked
what did you write  i was into wh back then. skaven and ork main

sadly  i think the whole woke thing is a one way street.  there s no going back because trying to do so will get you attacked and lambasted relentlessly until you are cancelled.  once you go down the path of woke  forever will it dominate your destiny.  end game was truly the end.
for you to be a  pick me   you d have to be single. if that is the case  i hope you meet a great man that shares your nerdy interest soon.
they keep losing money on most movies and shows but than are so amazed when they fail. how long for them to get it
as for marvel - i don t follow those comics  but i can certainly say that they need to keep male superheroes in play. it s a biiiig mistake to exclude them. they re going to drive away a large part of their fanbase  especially when they beat the dead horse by rewriting the male characters to female.re  tomboys  i don t mind tomboys at all  in fact i kinda like them since they re generally not the super girly  eww boys are gross and stupid  drama-queen type.heck  as a guy i even watch shoujo or  reverse harem  anime sometimes  cuz the romance is cute  and generally the female characters act more mature.what i don t like are busybodies who burst into your space and demand you bow to them   like they want to pick a fight. i m not interested in fighting with the opposite sex over who is better. i only want to be with people i could consider good  ol pals.
the glory days are gone. and it is dark age of cinema.
i m going to add something to why marvel pulling the switcheroos   because disney fudged numbers for captain marvel film.  the history of carol danvers in marvel comics shows the feminization of the company.  when she was ms. marvel warbird she was a blonde bombshell with some personal flaws  tony stark became her aa sponsor.   when they turned her into captain marvel  she would have been better received as a mary sue.  they knew the nerds would not turn out for that film.  disney bought seats and ran empty showings.  this was confirmed to me by a truck driver from iowa.  he looked in the theater and it was empty.  all the tickets were bought on line.  strangely  the same year  toy story and other projects under performed.  this was also when movie companies started to ask review sites to fortify against review bombing.  comic book you tubers called this out.  now they have to pull the switcheroo  because the turmoil in the comic book industry clearly shows the stories these weirdos have to tell are not heroic at all.
it s daft how there s one extreme or the other.. like their breaks are busted. we screamed past a balance   into absurdity. and when they slam into reverse back towards balance they ll inevitably go past it the other way too. simple accurate representation of known characters   story arcs  written   produced by fans  those looking to just entertain   be true to the source material. this is all we want.   why buy the i.p with its built in following if your just going to piddle all over everything   one. you end up with no following  no one interested.
legit! i m tired of the msheu happening  i want the mcu back like it used to be
i m hoping the wokie drama mess doesn t touch my mortal kombat any further than it already has... there will be some answering to do  if it does...  i just want my mk to have equal number of men to women if we re just talking about men women gender.
you are awesome!!!
i don t have to have all-male marvel  just good marvel. black widow was amazing and powerful before this slew of lousy writing. i agree that we have something going haywire where a film about dr. strange or black panther or thor isn t about the main character it s a vehicle to carry a secondary character.
makeentertainmentgreatagainwe can have strong female characters it just doesn t need to come at the expense of the male  characters. this pandering to narcissists  has only hurt the industry and instead of correcting the error they have doubled and tripled down harder than pirple aki. so now i expect either the industry to fix itself or burn to the ground like sodom and gamora. games aren t what they used to be  now they are made of people who can t handle a challenge and lack unique characters.
rockin  that l sweater.
i don t care whether men are masculine or whether women are feminine  even though statistically they tend to be that way . i only care that things emotionally make sense. if a female character is to adopt a heroic leadership role  that s fine but have her inhabit masculine energy  have her go through some harrowing soul-searching shit  have her survive it and emerge from the rubble exhibiting control and internal forward-moving purpose that inspires everyone  men included  to follow. not that that s the only way to show positive masculine energy. i dunno  just don t have her being self-satisfied at the result that half the population has been shown a lesson or some bullshit like that. if she s the leader  she should feel that half the population are her people too.
lol your dog caught my attention real quick. lol
you can make women with powers or just the women in the mcu strong without effecting the male characters. it just turns me off to see the smart male characters become dumber just to make a point to push a their female counterparts. make it equal and genuine
they literally made nebula into a male body for guardians 3. why do they have to retcon female characters to make them flat chested
i ve watched wakanda forever and throughout the movie i trought to myself are there really only 3 men innit   is this how women always feel   i ve never experienced something like that before.
marvel is really big so i don t think the female characters having more attention takes away from the male characters marvel just got bigger.
i think it already has
this  like 100 .
definitely a tangent  but i love your l hoodie
this is why dc is superior in content. they made alfred into a superhero called the macaroni lmaooo and i never thought i needed it.also  imo the deleted scene should of been kept in love and thunder it would of shown how humble zues was. but i guess jokes are more important. however  i hope that the falcon and the winter soldier is going to be good. i am also glad woke ideology hasn t infested hogwarts legacy.2 48but no lara croft would beat the ps1  lara croftalso imo i don t care if women are in video games  i just care if it s a well written character!
cute tomboy girl is right. straight up spitting facts. she might be the only gamer girl i d be willing to play with. and shed probably kick my ass  but i respect the fact that she gets it that video games and comics are predominantly for guys. and she s absolutely right about the whole people dont know how to deal with tomboys thing. i admit  me too. most people would just call them trans or lesbians  and i ve been doing that too lately. we all need to do better. respect each other s hobbies and just try not to take over their hobbies  alright
and bring back girly girls. like the video you made for nebula on the new movie poster.
bringing back man i think is good  dont have to be assholes however
i hope there is a job market for complaining about everything.
couldn t agree more! going full guns blazing on m-she-u made about as much sense as gender swapping  my little pony  to be all stallions.
it is not that hard. i what to see masculine men and feminine women. then that they do not replace male characters with women  like just make new characters that are women  that has their own thing going on for them  their own weaknesses  hero s journey etc. the only character that they have where they can get away with it is loke  like loke is a shapeshifter  loke can become anything at anytime  odd that they didn t use that more often.  the problem is that their writing staff is woke to insaity it seems  they need to remove them all and get in fans and old lore nerds in along with ppl that can write  then they have to retcoon all of the bad stuff to oblivion. they need to go full wonderbrothers on this thingy to be able to get in new ppl and good ppl  then restart pritty marvel and remove m-she-u... she hulk was a shitshow. like they didn t even bother to use the comic begining. then she hulk was smart  didn t whinne  used her power for good. as well being a lawyer. and the list goes on  they need to make a new she hulk that is more aline with the comic book then they will get ppl in  that is how they need to do with most of their things. then tor is a bloke. not a whamen.
you said  i don t mind women superheroes but please not so much  lmfao marvel ain t pandering to you
l is the man
yes the overwhelming majority of people want video games  movies  tv shows  and sports to be for escapism! and fun entertainment! not for political   social agenda s.
just stumbled across your channel from a critical drinker podcast you where on and i have to say  you re a national treasure! so glad to see young women like yourself not falling prey to the woke ideologies. we need more like you for sure.
uhm  this might surprise you melonie  but nerdkind is not restricted to men or boys. we were always accepting of anyone who is nerdy  didn t matter if you were male  female  white  black etc. there just isn t many of us.
yes i believe the definition be a big up for the men and women as well as for the mandalorian boy you know why they f    up with that kicking out gina carano now she s doing independent movies and pretty good as for tomb raider questionable that s it back to watching contra alien wars videos
speaking of common power fantasies  if anyone is reading this  i d like to compare and contrast common power fantasies here. for example i m a man  and a power fantasy i have  and get to live out in a lot of video games  is being the most powerful person in the room but acting polite and civil  like trying to broker alliances. and when someone mistakes my civility for weakness and tries to threaten me  i explode with ferocity and power they could never dream of  and immediately they backpedal and are suddenly willing to negotiate. happens a lot in star wars games.so how about all of you
melonie mac wasn t made to be easy on the eyes for you.
tomboy here! i have always been a tomboy but i have never felt male. to all these sjw creeps that want to ocd label everyone and everything  suck it!  proud southern lady here. i love  and have my whole life. bought my first console as a sega genesis as a kid  saved my allowance afterwards to afford the games  video games  anime  sky and scuba diving  and battlebots! i also love weaving on looms  writing novels  reading a good book  taking care of my chickens  putting away food by dehydrating and canning  and the flowers my wonderful husband surprises me with every month. you really can have it all! i m all for gate keeping these days. lock the gate up tight and shoot trespassers lest they take the only things we have left that we love. after they ruined star wars  which the ot will remain forever in my heart  we have no excuse for being blindsided by these people trying to take over a ruin wonderful things. we ve seen what they want to do. we need to fight back while we still can.
don t hold your breath  disney owned marvel is peak wokeness.nothing short of a radical shift in leadership  staff and ideology can change that.eric july has the right idea in making his own heroes but he can t match the output and budget of marvel dc.
that s the problem  melonie they don t know how because they re written by tumblr and wattpad writers!
a woman s true nature is to be attracted to a man s strength and their ability to protect them. it s human nature  it s biology  it s biblical  it s common sense. it s the way things should be. even physically strong women are attracted to bigger stronger men.
i meant what i said
me but with mass effect
frosk is that you xd
while men are attracted to a woman s kindness  grace  loyalty and especially nurturing. which is why galadriel from peter jackson s lotr will hold a place in my heart while all these stronk whamen babes i don t even remember most of them.
true!
my pronouns are...mucho macho. don t misgender me!!!
not that i disagree  but to play devils advocate  you like a character that is a beautiful brunette who is athletic  smart  a bit of a loner and into a male dominated world   maybe you felt represented
the problem with the m-she-u isn t marvel  it s on disney  the mcu never got this crazy until disney demanded representation  look at what disney is doing to non-marvel movies  they turned the little mermaid from caucasian to a poc  look what they did to star wars  they ruined many character legacies just to push their agendai believe mark hamil even said the disney luke isn t his lukeharrison ford was happy with his contribution regardless of disney writing  because harrison didn t even want to return in the og trilogy  so when tfa got harrison to return as han  disney allowed han to be killed
we need to get you on testosterone therapy asap because you would be so cool and everything and stuff.
what s bad is that a lot of these characters could have been great additions to the mcu  but rather than crafting good stories   development for them  they re just poster children for whatever flavor-of-the-month agenda the powers that be are pushing.black widow should have had her own film in phase 2 or 3  she-hulk should have been awesome  heck  i think lady thor could have been great if that whole movie wasn t such a huge turd.
i love women
yo name your top 5 bands every time i watch your videos i wonder what you listen to. is it metal core or old punk
surely the marvels will be the lowest grossing mcu movie in every measure to date. black widow s introduction in iron man 2 was done well  she was super smart  very beautiful and kicked ass. they really pulled her off fantastically way back when. same with peggy carter in captain america 1. very smart  very beautiful and kicked ass. neither were particularly overpowering  just very strong female characters that added to the movies with fairly attainable skills. just started teetering with valkyrie in ragnarok in my opinion.
we re bringin  sexy back.
marvel is more interested with pushing their social political views these days rather than good storytelling. it seems like after dc came out with wonder woman in 2017  which i thought was a good movie   marvel was upset that they got beat to market with a female lead super-hero so they went all-in on trying to prove just how pro-woman they were to make up for it. of course they did this by demeaning the male heroes  showing them as lesser than their female counter-parts thinking this would make their female fans happy.  well  as you state  it did not. women who actually like these characters don t appreciate it  they actually like manly men-shocking right   while the women that do tend not to be into this genre anyway. they only like it because it demeans men and props up narcissistic women  like themselves . i guess marvel disney will need to loose more money before they get the message  if they ever do .
nothing wrong with a tomboy!
the only time inserting a female into a former male role worked was starbuck in the new battlestar galactica.  i was all against it until i watched the show and it was phenominal!  but she wasnt a man-hater either....
melonie talk to anna tswg about manly heros! she s probably the best advocate for manly men lol. anita sarkeesian is the absolute worst type of sjw!
facts
a common lie they use is the  we were always there  but sexist misogynistic men kept us from enjoying things no  you weren t there. the amount of women in those hobbies were small and the ones trying to change it now are the ones that made fun of people for liking games  card games  anime  etc.
no one hollywood 2023  please believe women are men!  pleease! !  box office
guys used to watch movies with male and female heroes alike  the thought never came up that there s a noteable distinction when seeing sarah connor  ripley or the charlies angels movies of the early 2000. now we just expect a lot of h ting on men when that happens and channels like this or lauren chen s often confirm that. and why would we wanna watch that  ist s not like women were treated that way  no they s crifieced a dozen guys to try to save a woman from a big ape and stuff like that. they were treated as people worth trashing a bunch of dudes for  now those dudes just get trashed in a totally new way.
i m a guy and laughed at happy fighting one guard when blackwidow wiped out the rest while he struggled with one  but that s not progressive enough for these weirdos
yes!! thank you!!!
this issue runs so much more deeply than just entertainment. i understand i may have a tin foil hat on for this one  but men are so weak  you should see what we get in the military these days as new troops. its... just... wild.

@melonie mac go boom   you gotta jam avenged sevenfold into there somehow  c mon.. p
tell em melkeep on gate-keepin but most of all....go boom!!
comics are escapism  male power-fantasies for young boys mainly. young boys have no power at all  the books and the toys and the movies and all of it helps the young boys cope with that temporary stage of their lives. it s cool if grown ups like it  if the girls like it  but it once was there for an actual purpose  a niche market. it s really sad when geek culture becomes main-stream. it s never as cool ever again.
i got out of the mcu after endgame  that pretty much got rid of all my interests to watch the movies in the future.  iron man was gone  cap was gone  thor was pretty much gone even before this and i just wanted the hulk to go away after they somehow made the hulk less masculine  the hulk of all people .  my interests started to fade before endgame  but that was basically the end for me.it wasn t even just the absence of the male characters  the characters were the fulcrum of the mcu  the first four movie franchises of the mcu were the foundation of their whole movie universe  they tried to replace that foundation but in my opinion the mcu has been lacking in quality ever since endgame happened!!!
oh my  don t remind me of those dark days of  mutant ninja turtles  on fox kids! adding venus a female turtle was one of many terrible ideas for that show.. my bruh we legit watch them fight multi dimensional traveling humanoids dragons  yea yea.
leonardo leads donatello does machines raphael is cool but rude michaelangelo is a party dude. and the female turtle is shoehorned in
ultimate tomboy  caitlin clarke from dragonslayer
with male superheros you don t need to pander or make their characters good at everything. just have a great story and awesome fights and we re satisfied. women need to make everything a platform and have to be a perfect hero without struggle which makes it boring. wonder woman being the exception that was a good movie.
when i see an in-shape dude it flips my competitor switch  so the idea of hypothetically dating a hot woman in the future doesn t motivate me to the gym nearly as much as passing some chad on the street.  manly men save lives  from heart disease !!
@03 05 - zoe walks in  me   forgets whatever melonie is saying    p u p p y !!!  3
you don t have to be a tomboy to have your views - just a normal hetero female!
make a video on the unexpected success of rrr in the western market
i appreciate a woman speaking up for this because it s made no sense to me who they were making these latest movies for   i would think feminists would hate marvel movies but they re making them for you  tom boys   not knowing what you might enjoy lol they don t understand you as a market cause you re  tom boys  and not the pronouns crowd ...so thank you
if arya stark from session one existed in this century  they d have a doctor co-sign reassignment. she d be so focused on medication and confusion  she d never become the assassin she was. other than brienne  look how the women in her world lived and were viewed. she chose different and it was ok. she still got some d in the end lol but seriously  tomboys have been around and they didn t become boys nor was it suggested. all this post-2014 crap after potus 44 signed that bill is new garbage.
i agree melonie
totally agree .... she hulk sucked  big time. but ms. marvel was good  as was captain marvel - a strong  kick arse  female lead  and there were strong male characters in captain marvel - samuel l. jackson and ben mendelson. sure  jude law got stuffed around  but he deserved it. brier larson is a good actress  but obviously pisses off a lot of dudes. too  bad. not me though. and black widow was a terrific movie. so yeah  totally agree with what you say. so  hang in there she-dude  -  bring back gina  and thor  and the women luvin  male heroes  cause that s real  isn t it...
i like your fat cat at the end. it was a good monologue but for me the cat stole the show at the last minute.
the problem with so many of these forced female characters we are getting these days is how the filmmakers are making them so toxic but telling us their toxicity is virtuous.take captain marvel  for example. her entire character arc in her movie is that she must realize she is better than everyone else and that she has been a victim her entire life. really  are we supposed to be moved by this then take tony stark s character arc throughout the first 3 phases of the mcu. we see a man who starts out arrogant and thinking he s better than everyone else. this is a character and personality we are shown to be flawed and toxic. throughout the first 3 phases we see him become selfless and caring about other people more than himself  ultimately sacrificing himself for the good of everyone else. we see him understand what is truly valuable in life. where does he ultimately find his true happiness and purpose  in his family. in being a good father and husband.modern feminists are out there telling women they have been victims of the patriarchy because they have been expected to be good mothers and wives throughout history  and had certain societal responsibilities as women. guess what  men have responsibilities as well. it is not oppression for women to be expected to be caretakers  mothers  and wives. just how it is not oppression for men to be expected to be protectors  fathers  and husbands. the left and feminists just don t believe in personal responsibility. it is not about the individual  it is about the family unit as a whole and embracing these roles by both men and women will provide happiness in the long run.
totally bring back the men. how can you turn thor into a simp  he s the god of thunder. it needs to be logical. it needs to make sense. it needs to adhere to the lore. there are plenty of female hero s. it doesn t require the neutering of the male hero s.
there are a few and only few great female character in the mcu that are done justice and not like brie larson which are  black widow by scarlet johanson wandas character and agatha and the photon character seen and introduced in wandavision but none other than those characters
bringing in good writers would help too. thor is manly  but dark world through love and thunder suck ass. even iron man 2 and 3 is suspect. but i agree mostly with your title. just like in star wars. the original and prequels had a beautiful holy trinity. the originals had luke  leia and han. prequels... obi-wan  anakin and padmae. both pairs are attractive  chivalrous characters. when i see rey  and kylo ren  i see nothing memorable or meaningful.
peter laird agrees.  creatively bankrupt  is his take on the matter.
i like a woman who likes watching a sausage fest.
i feel like marvel s way of presenting this to us recently has been lack luster. gender stereotypes already exists  you don t need to hone in on it and have it repeated in every 3 scenes of your movie or tv show. there s nothing wrong with showing that it can be accepted by society but pandering gets old  quickly.
i have no problem with a woman lead or woman character in movies. it s the way these women characters are presented that people don t find appealing  often antagonistic and demeaning.
the marvels should be renamed the narci-sisters.
as someone who grew up in the 80s reading comics and manga i totally disagree with the idea that comic books are a male-oriented medium. comic books historically has always been gender neutral in terms of audience and i can think back to middle school where i had female friend who were avid collectors and the same can be said about manga. most people don t even realize that the majority of manga readers are actually female.
background pet invasion that was cute.
iron man to iron heart  thor to captain marvel  black panther to princess shuree  hawkeye to kate bishop  ant man to cassie lang  hulk to she hulk  and probably a few i am missing.  why are you a  pick me  but all these men writing all this pandering crap or all the corporate entities throwing out this pandering crap are not  pick me  i like how the favorites of the strong women genre don t ever have to bring up the fact that they are women to achieve their goals.  black widow didn t need to say a bad word about anyone because they were men or point out how great she was because she was a woman.  she just came out and did her job as well as she could.
i still believe tlou was the start of the downfall in western games.
you should do a collab with brett cooper
we can t always articulate the vibe when we know something isn t right  but no need. have confidence in just saying  nah this won t work   and show support to ppl that look to rectify it. any waaactivist that wants to drag you into the weeds and mud about the particulars  just politely decline the offer  . im not a politican  eff off buddy. anything political is supposed to be like voting  that s none of your business pal why i think that way. we gotta take that back and not play their game anymore  but we do need a higher ground for that and some solidarity behind that idea.
yeah. tom-boys vs mom-girls. think about it
i like female characters.but we re not really seeing female characters  we re seeing someone s ideology with a skin on it.i just want good stories again  written by people who understand how humans work.
if a male likes having hot chicks in chick flicks  chicks should be allowed to want desirable males in male stuffcomicbooks were mainly bought and written by males for decades  chicks can enjoy them too. you dont have to ruin it to allow chicks to like it
so many female comic book characters that they could do  but no they gotta do a female thor  female hulk lmao
wow! phase 5 is out of the gates with a bang  except kevin feige forgot to throw the firecracker. since when did a convenient plot device become the norm for  writers  to bail themselves out  and what movies have they seen where inner monologuing works  and who are all of these characters that were supposed to care about  there are more bailouts in this movie than during the wall street crash in 2008 and that is exactly the path ceo bob  i was on vacation  iger is headed. the few times i did laugh wasn t because i was tickled by something that was written or delivered cleverly  but out of embarrassment for the catastrophe of what has become the m she u franchise. disney has turned marvel into a unreliable boiler that has to be reset everyday or she ll blow up. i wanted to like this movie so much and spend the weekend maybe going again. but - i ll pass and stay at home and play hogwarts legacy. thanks for nothing marvel.
imo i think that s what they re trying to do to the witcher  that s why henry cavill left
i m not like all the other girls guys! i like all the stuff those stupid girls like. i m really cool  ironic  and just the right amount of corky  but never in an annoying girl kind of way. so now that you know  will you pick me
game devs these days have really forgotten that games are  you know  games.  they do actually have to shut up and let us play at some point.  yeah  you can have a big story driven game  but the whole cutscene every three steps with gameplay that s too easy even on nightmare difficulty kind of needs to stop.  look at the mass effect series for instance.  hugely story and character driven experience  but you have so many choices of what to do and say that impact elements of the story going forward  and the gameplay is actually fun and challenging on higher difficulty settings.  i m getting sick of sitting down to play the new god of war and sitting there for two hours and maybe having about 10 mins of actual gameplay in it while kratos whines and complains about his feels in endless cutscenes  and his son complains about him being too strict.  been there.  done that.  it s why i call the first game dad of boy  instead of god of war.  think i m going to start calling ragnarok dad of boy 2  dad harder now.
you lost me @3 03 with doggo
who do you blame though   a single person in anita sarkeesian  or even a few feminist activists   or the entire industry for going along with them    the problem isn t with the whiners and criers  it s those who listen to them and push their garbage.  if these companies just ignored them  the sales would continue  franchises would be left unharmed  and they would eventually fade away into obscurity.mel  cute as always.
black widow and elektra are bae... but most of the stuff marvel does with females is serious cringe. ideology and nothing else.
start with sentry  fantastic four  x men  ghost rider  silver surfer and adam warlock
my sisters don t like marvel anymore because there s no more hot guys. male dominated spaces are not sexist.  makemarvelmaleagain
wait!  are you saying that you can be entertained even if you do not see someone that looks and acts exactly like you in the media that you are consuming!   how is this possible!!    are you also saying that you can relate to characters in fiction that don t look  or sound like you  and maybe even aren t the same sex as you are!   that just can t be true!  it is just not possible to enjoy a story if i am not the center of it!  we ve accidentally created an entire generation of narcissists and storytelling will suffer greatly for it
john wick and the fallen franchise with gerald butler were successful because of men
if only kevin feige wasn t a simp or whatever the hell he is. then we would have a much better marvels series and it would feel like phase 1 again only 100x better.
my sister grew up with 4 brothers jaja she was a big tom boy but then grew out of it and hates this feminist gender selection stuff too jajajaj
i m all for strong female characters.  but the whole  batsuit works when it fits a woman  bit was never something i enjoyed.  brie larson s arrogance at thinking she was now portraying the strongest character in the mcu did not help the character s popularity at all.  give me a good character and story and it won t matter what their gender is.  or shouldn t.   shrug
i m not at all mad at female representation in entertainment. what s ridiculous is that it s shoved down our throats  and at the expense of men. you don t see every woman in entertainment being presented as some bumbling idiot  or some sexist villain. especially in marvel movies. it s  in fact very much the opposite.  in modern day entertainment i have to say that i don t women pursuing actual equality. i see woman throwing temper tantrums and honestly far more sexist than you accuse men of being
next victim  starsky   hutch   t___t
random idea  a tear in the fabric of space time between the world of tomb raider and the original nes ducktales game  which causes lara croft and uncle scrooge to swap realities. kinda like that thing with jimmy neutron and fairly odd parents  back in the day
10 30 - i call them consumers
i don t mind female super hero s  but i believe you d agree with this keep communism and feminism and wokeism   which they all are basically the same thing   out of movies and shows!!!!!!! the narcissists are coming out of the closet. i love the animals in the background!!!
you are not the target audience  zen-z and next gen are. recall what your parents thought about characters of movies that you liked  they thought of them as soft boys not manly enough  but u think those movies were great. same thing you are doing but kids love these movies and they will continue to love as they grow to be adult.why should males be pressurized to suit one s expectations of manly man. softness also has lots to offer many great men were soft and kindhearted and wouldnt fall into modern idea of manly men. making profits is not the only motivation behind movie making getting your views across is also a driving force.
i think these people really care too much about what people  and it s funny  because they don t even know themselves.
it can be argued that laura started  but didn t stay  a rip off female indiana jones. she was never intended to erase him and take his place  that s the difference. these new  female remakes  always involve erasing the founding characters.
bring back good ole fashioned tomboys please
here s the thing  physically women will never be intimidating as men. same goes for superhero females  i can t take shuri seriously because she s a twig. same for red death in the flash you just can t but i will say shitty writing does play into it.
people wouldn t mind female heroes so much if they didn t replace iconic heroes on the first place. they just feel like a corporate sell out and without any effort nor originality  just a cheap reboot with politics inserted. that s why when something iconic comes along and exists under its own weight it becomes wonder woman  black widow  gamorra  starlight  heroes on their own right  not because the plot demands them to be  to be the most intelligent  the most capable  and the most beautiful one on the screen that does everything perfectly all the time. we like heroes not because they are perfect but because they have short comings  limitations and they suffer as we do. and if disney wants to prioritize to tell the same story  with the same politics  with the same concept and execution  well  i bet they competitors won t.
aaaah thats a goodlooking deathnote hoodie
it s not patriarchy that few women in history were soldiers or warriors. societies that risked women to death didn t last long.men are  for better or worse  just better suited to dishing out copious violence. this is why superheros are predominantly men.
yet everything caters exclusively to people born 1991-2001 these days
cringe
@lingr icen  eloquently put.
but being kindhearted and manly aren t mutually exclusive. you seem to think that masculinity is always toxic  like a lot of people nowadays and it s just not true.dads being worried for and protective of their kids for example is very soft and emotional but one of the most manly things ever.society still has much to learn.and by the way  my parents didn t give a shite. all that nonsense seems to be a product of murican hardcore macho culture anyway and doesn t apply to the whole world.
mshe had a good run but it s time go back wot i m saying marvel sing coming back lol
mcu is literally dead for me i didn t even go see the last movie in theaters. last one was thor love and thunder. almost every new marvel movie haves a female version of that character. black panther is now a female and so is iron man iron heart   now ant man is probably gonna be replaced with cassie  the only men in the avengers is sam wilson falcon america and dumb smart hulk who seems useless. probably will watch the new ant man movie when it comes to one of the streaming sites i use. i refuse to give disney any of my money since they don t like my race as it is shown in proud family lol
as bad as it is for the boys and our hobbies  it is just as bad for the girls that have been into these hobbies all this time too. contrary to popular feminist doctrine  women have always been allowed to play games read comics etc...they think they are taking away all the boys toys  that ll teach them for oppressing women all these years  but all the girls liked these characters too. as a women you are being told that now you are interested in nerd stuff you have to be interested in it the way we tell you to enjoy it. they replaced all the long standing loved characters with feminist approved characters that women must now like instead. that ahs to be pretty insulting
ironically- this whole push to appeal to women makes me more embarrassed to like this media because it now feels like  girlish  media now! she-hulk for instance... oh my god i want a superhero story  not a damn soap opera that would only appeal to the people that don t even like superheroes... i got into this hobby because i didn t like those types of shows! nowadays it feels like everything is to appeal to the  for the lack of a better term   girly girls  and it drives me nuts lmao-
ah yes  i remember when i played bayonetta and was super mad because there wasn t any man pulling off those femme fatale alluring gymnastics and gunplay shoehorned into the game. and then i played devil may cry and was super mad there wasn t any woman pulling off those macho suave innuendos at the hell stone plate while testing out her new weapon.
yes please. why do they think women started going to these movie
every single male lead marvel movie has a female costar who is more powerful and better than him in everyway. the only male to even land a punch on a female waa thanos but he needed the infinity gauntlet to even hit her once.  black valkyrie just bodied loki and thor. loki couldnt even land a single blow. when the marvel movie is female lead then not only is their not a male co lead whos even equal a male co lead cannot exist when the movie is a female lead marvel movie. im told the only reason a man wouldnt want to watch 105lb  5 foot notbing females beat up numerous 265lb men is sexism.training and a character arc dont exist for female characters they are perfect. their only flaw is they need to break away from the white males holding them back and they go on a journey to find out they are more perfect and amazing than they ever imagined.
the reason everyone dislikes the m she u isn t because of the female characters necessarily. it is because they are gender swapped male characters  that somehow are even more powerful than their male counterparts  and they are arrogant as hell while doing it. it is so corny  and forced and you can feel it in the films  it is completely unnatural and fabricated. if you want to make a female lead hero movie  create a totally new character or do a film on a traditionally female character  and have them be more humble  and genuinely good to people. nobody wants a gender swapped  egotistical  big mouth female hero that has no flaws. so cheesy.
just subscribed immediately
dude as atomboy all mylife  create new female characters or use the female characters that you have and have themembrace their feminity and masculinity. i hate when marvel and dc wanna push this feminism crap. black widow was a great character because she was not only badass but also sexy and a great supporting characters to the males on the avengers. instead having girls lead franchises of men have guys come back  and have the girls have their own franchise and be great supporting characters to the men. it s okay for a woman to be feminine it s okay for a woman to embrace her feminity it s okay for a woman to be strong but know when to depend on the man. it s not the men are stronger or smarter or have more value it s just okay for them to lead  woman accept that some woman can be just as strong as the men or smarter than them but it s okay for them want a guy to be a lead i don t understand why modern day woman can t understand that simpleconcept. woman can have spaces ormoves in super hero films without man bashing men what the hell.
3 02 well hello there puppy. welcome.
i don t know a single man who grew up gaming  who has any issue with remakes in games. what we hate is this weird feminist propaganda. my favorite genera is survival horror  a genera filled almost 50 50 with male and female protagonists. fatal frame  the re series  silent hill  clock tower  signalis etc . so the lie men just hate women and that s why feminist propaganda fails  is utter nonsense. i have zero issue with female leads in games or movies. but how about bothering to write a believable woman  rather than just taking a man and giving him breasts and calling him karen like 99.9  of feminist films so.
imagine taking the force of nature that was thor from the eddas and turning him into the simpering  lovesick  lickspittle that is the current thor.thor is red haired  red bearded embodiment of a raging storm  not this blonde  whiney  small fraction of a man.case in point  one of my favorite thor stories https   youtu.be clzzr2ojld0
if you want macho men and attractive women...you pretty much gotta turn to anime these days.dragon ball  my hero academia  one punch man etc
take out the manly women  lol works both ways
i appreciate your opinion. just a dude here.
the narcissists are being glorified . yep. and by whom  by other narcissists of course!
sorry  i was distracted by a lazy puppy coming in to see what was going on.   you were saying
respect
hah i love this chic!
this
go outside please lmao no one is telling women what to read watch. even if they were no one is forcing them to do anything.
@chocochib  the point i was making was that these activist movie makers are taking away things that women also liked and replacing them with what they are telling  women they should like. at no point did i say anybody was being forced to do anything.
hahha i liked your death not shirt  did not know you watch anime
melanie mac  i choose you!
it s not  pick me  but rather   good pickings
15 09  your cat is not impressed
make marvel male again  i mean could their be a better title than that  just wondering anyway keep it up
we d all pick you melanie
and feminine women please
dog walks in at 3 04 oh she s doing her thing in front of the thing  i m more important  let s grab her attention.
i hip-thrusted the like button for the l sweater
melanie they re messing with my boy frank castle that s making me very angry
its funy you say this becuase in gundam it had the opposite effect where it was a woman dominate hobby back in the day with the anime and manga untill the model kits came out and then it ended up becoming a male dominant hobby
awesome!!!!!!!!
noooo  let it die. it can come back strong again in a decade or so
the m-she-u just does nt get it!
can t wait till culture shifts and traditional values are back in style again. but i ll probably be 80 by then.
i like that l hoodie
you re not a pick me. you re right.
it s not even that. just make it good.
awww  look at the doggy! lol
she s looking for a hobby ever heard of warhammer.fun for the whole family   tabletop  novels  computer games  modeling  cosplay and much more you too will be part of the bed ass community.
cuz you ll never get to do that to a girl irl
good lord  put that cat on a diet  no worse than my doggo tho
my wife  daughter  mother   on and on  are saying the same thing. let the tomboys  2 of our sisters out of six kids  agree .make it make again. and if you want the female dominated comics  movies etc.  make your own. create your own world of comic book movies if that s what you want.  just don t piggyback on the back of know comic book heroes and try to kick them to the curb.men are men and shouldn t be ashamed of being guys. as black widow said in age of ultron    i am always cleaning up after you boys . which was cool in its own way as she wasn t spouting off an heir of superiority as these new feminists are attempting with each franchise.keep the original  well original.
i love that the white woman is the center of the poster! lol
i haven t seen the video yet but  like omg you re such a pick me!!
i don t necessarily want to see marvel to be male again more than i want to see it be great again.  makemarvelgreatagain  msheudown
no one ever messwith you baby.  ever.
tomboys are my shit
marvel has gone full dilbert.
anita sarkeesian sounds like   i need ta eat cesium  make superheroes meat again. no more plant based superhero films.
marvel has some of the coolest women  phoenix  rogue  electrabut they also want iron man  thor  spider man.i don t get it.
but this is what women wanted right
amen sister
most of these new writers are the guys who got smoked by sports athletic guys like myself in gym class dodge ball so this is the payback for them. the most beautiful thing in this world is a woman who likes sports video games  can rock sweatpants chill with you watching football or great movies  but can flip that switch and show that sexual sensuality when its time for the meeting in our bedroom.
what do you mean we don t need to see ourselves in our entertainment   i play mass effect because i am clearly a badass soldier who saves the galaxy 3 times in a row and sleeps with sexy alien chicks... oh wait...
iv tried to tell my friend this stuff you said in this video and he called me a bigot
true tomboys are marriage material  change my mind.
can marvel focus on storytelling again
just ron swanson all of this. two sexes. don t harm others and fix the shit made by others.
puppy crawling in 3 00
female leads can be amazing  like wonderwoman  lara croft  black widow  scarlet witch  harley quinn. but... when they are theres saying  a woman needs to do it  like cmon. it s about teamwork  not bringing the other sex down to elevate yourself just because they are male.
speaking of ninja turtles  i stand to be corrected on this   but i read somewhere that the new ninja turtle movie is all female ninja turtle s.
what the hell was that thing   a tribble with legs
100
agree except for that 10 59  are you saying us casual gamers are not true gamers
a lot of guys would pick you regardless lol
you know what happens to  pick me   girls  they get picked.

your cat looks like mr bokus haha
i believe in tomboy supremacy
i wonder if inserting females into male spaces and vice versa is just an expression of sexual deficit.what would freud say
i 100  agree. i miss masculinity. marvel is awful anymore.
if you want manly dudes check out college female swimming.
the title is hilarious.
marvel has been woke for a while now. i stopped buying the comics a while back.
is that kurama from yu yu hakusho on your hoodie melanie
nice l hoodie.  3
a male  friend  of a female is a myth  there s never been such a thing. much like the urban legend of the  female orgasm   right

damn right
i grew up on dragon ball z and he-man and power ranger s and  pok mon and most not all are about saving the world and men that put their lives on the line to protect that which they love  unless we are talking about goku i doubt he would protect chi-chi and if he does than cool  like this woke ideology is so broken and so decisive that its sad humanity is better than this divide
we all thought disney buying most all of the marvel properties is a fantastic thing that ever happened  ohhh we are definitely wrong! right now  i   almost everybody hates properties getting the disney treatment. look what happened to the marvel properties and the star wars i.p. disney is trashing  destroying  and tarnishing these. let s hope the house that mickey mouse built will crumble   burn into flaming pile of horse crap. really! a lot of people these days have lost respect to disney.
tomboys are the best.
omg melony i seen ur asmr on myrs  stream lmaooo when u did th korn skate an then eat th mic  i couldn t breath!!!
your cat is so cute
get ready for starsky and hutch remake   but with women.
i like some of the female characters  but...yeah. some balance is needed.
hey pretty melonie and cool dogs we know female great characters exist and female used to be hot sure girls come in all types of shapes yet we are looking a great fiction movie to enjoy thats all we dont want all women to looks like a guy is not asking for to much right  also you are a beauty melonie  you are not too tomb boy just a little..
i don t find it hard to identify with someone unlike me. that the woke do is pathological.
old tv old movies old video games is the best escape form the woke
if ur a pick me then ur my fav pick me! keep up the good work n pissing off these snowflakes
they are making marvel manly  just all the females are being manly lol
...they re the ones prepared to lose much monies...
not gonna happen that roadmap goes to 2028
you are so beautiful... don t worry i ain t no crazy dude ... i just recognize the beautiful person.. as within and out ...beautiful daughter of man ...
politics and wokeness in entertainment doesn t sell. it s as simple as that. the latest marvel movies and hogwarts legacy is proving this fact. these studios need to wake up and tell woke culture to shut up and let entertainment just be entertaining again and stay true to the original source material. if they want to make new political woke entertainment come up with new stories to tell.
marvel i think has lost its magic sadly
i grew up on.  a lot of different kinds of nerd stuff .  d d games  video games   anime  marvel  dc  lord of the ring  doctor who    star wars.  once   end game  finally finished.  i have walked away from marvel.  i loved    rouge one .  but not what the have done.  to luke skywalker in   the last jedi .  perfect  example is the   witcher .  henry cavill is a fanboy    geek like us.  he wanted to follow the history of   the witcher .  but hollywood had other ideas .  i never knew about the history.  i never followed this game  or books.  but after knowing about his protection.  of the rich history of it.  i got interested in it.  i m glad that my kid s.  got to enjoy all of the nerd world .  before it got so woke.  this retired 57 year old man.  enjoys the videos that you post.  keep up the great work you do.  .
dope hoodie
as a man whose name is defined as thor s hammer in norse mythology thor is a soft spot in my heart don t mess with thor or the story or nothing please and thank you
in my opinion  there should be a balance between women and men but i don t see the balance.
your dog is so cute
i watched   ant man 3 yesterday and was asking the same question. where are the men  they had no men in black panther 2. loki  hawkeye  thor  iron man  hulk have all been replaced. by the way it seems like all the men need women to help them and even save them
melonie is a pygmy girl
can you do a puss in boots 2 movie review
nah. i have abandoned marvel after decades. main dc comics too. i went back to warhammer. hell  i don t even watch as many movies or shows anymore  just read books - and writing some of my own.
don t worry. men will take control of those things again    it will all get better.
preach
when i was young i watched xena the warrior princes alongside hercules and both were nice entertainment! where did it all go wrong........ please people eat more animal based omega 3 so your brains start working again! soon ai takes over and wonders over us  how the f did they ever manage to create me us
watch anime if you want to see male again
doctor who. was taken over by a woke writer and they woke actress. it had the worst ratings in doctor who history people thought it was going to be canceled for sure. now sony has taken over doctor who and an old writer who made it what it was his back.
you are a tomboy
real tomboys are rad. these woke  tomboys  are just bsing us nerds
build it   they will come
its the juice
disney ruins everything and i saw something on my google homepage that the next cg tmnt are gonna be girls
i don t even have a problem with female leads but they re written so damn poorly and it just drives me nuts  like for example  they made she hulk in a scene basically compare being catcalled and mansplained to bruce s trauma from being abused as a kid by his own father.....wow  they re nowhere near on the same level and that s toxic that you would even compare something like that  and then the other marvel characters like captain marvel bucked up on thor  a male just to prove how  equally strong  she is  it s honestly just seeming more like toxic feminism at this point  i should also make this clear too  women  it s not a bad thing to be a feminine woman  you can still be a feminine woman and strong  women aren t supposed to be like men  that s what makes them special and same with men  men aren t supposed to be like women and that s what makes them special.
people need to ditch marvel and star wars and never pick it up again until disney sells it
i love that movie. didnt think i would.
marvel movies will never be the same again  the last great movie was the last avengers  disney today destroys everything they touch  not gonna spend even one single cent on anything related to current modern disney.
3 00 surprise doggy yoga
you seem more of what i call a tomgirl you like some of the stuff guys do but you don t act like a guy and still do some feminine stuff too like haircare  make up and skin treatment etc.but i enjoy masculine games like shooters and fighting games as much as other guys do but i also enjoy rpg s for the great stories and characters and i won t areith s death in final fantasy 7 had me in tears and some anime too like when belldandy had to erase keiichi s memories of her or in young justice when kid flash is transporting a heart for a little girl and is told he is too late when he arrives at the hospital.people are complex and have different sides to themselves this doesn t mean they need to change gender or make one up just because the are not stereotypical masculine or feminine 24 7 as the truth is nobody fit the stereotypes 100  we are all individuals you can have masculine or feminine traits no matter what gender you actually are.
welcome to the us military today
gears 5 was the weird one to switch to a female lead
love your channel what s your opinion on diablo4 would love to get group with you in diablo4 on xbox
14 50
deff related  so tired of the badly written female main characters. they act like we didnt already have strong female lead characters. same with my fellow writers as well. you can be strong without being an ahole.
tomboys rise up!
agree
woke culture shows us exactly why gatekeeping is an amazing thing.
...whats a pickme
it s not about making it male again it s about making good movies again  i don t care about the gender
go boom
cute puppy
you ain t heard...god is they or them now.....
15 10 fat cat spotted!
if marvel started out with women they would never have killed off the tony start version of those characters in a movie like endgame  and go mainly male afterthat  theyd never go that way
remember chris gore s comment  make marvel male again  trust me melonie  you are not the 1st or only one feeling like this.  yet they are replacing males with females and altering females to look more male  make up your mind disney.
3 00
what is the opposite of a tomboy  and why is it ridiculed and shamed whilst tomboys are considered good
that s called a tomboy. tomboys are still girlie too  but society has forgotten what tomboys are and think tomboy means butch or masculine when it does not
@melonie mac go boom  i was in school in the uk during the 90 s and the tomboy s were basically just like boys act like them dressed like them no cosmetics short hair usually into sports not many of the tomboy group did anything that people consider feminine really i don t know if its different in the us but that s what it was like at my school.
lol yes and some superheros are ment to be male and some are ment to be female and like can you imagine a male wonder woman lol
you do realize it s fiction  right
at this point  idc if marvel makes a comeback. they ve destroyed all their best characters  they do not deserve to make a comeback  even if they realize all their mistakes.
ms marvel was actually a decent show  she was her own person  not a gender swap or something. i love brie larson but her captain marvel has been hit and miss. if the movie is good or not hinges on her character
there is a cat also  neow way! sorry. got a bit off topic there.
guys wanna be batman superman spiderman..you know..superheroes.women wanna me cardi b megan the e horse and nicki minaj s...you know...sloots
cool
cha alt!
the new marvel is by and for shallow people. they can t see past gender or skin color. we care about story  we care about personallity  we care about overcoming hardships.
i wish they would look at house of the dragon. strong women without being male characters that they cast as women.
alien  ripely
marvel is a true disgrace. can t be fixed under disney s leadership i for the most part forget it exists  aside from the old comics
there no toxic masculinity or toxic feminine .it s toxic fandom!!! ..to me if you love something you should be able to see the bad or stupid in it .i love wrestling .but i know it s a play ..and i can make fun of it better than someone who doesn t see watch .
the problem is marvel is saying its her story now and if you have a problem with that then you are the problem. now dont get me wrong female superheroes are fine. the issue is  yes there are women like you that watch these type of movies but the main audience and demographic are guys like me....... and it will always be like that. there s just no changing that. and as many have found out you don t alienate your main audience or demographic
i agree. the new m-she-u focus in marvel films has been cringe to watch. it might have worked if the story telling was good  but marvel films are now preachy and terribly written.
let a woman be a woman and a man  be a man .   prince get up
marvel has been too commodified for me to give a shit about it
and there doing that in professional wrestling to
1000 !!! yes! its too late marvel is over
i d pick you
this is the argument that i have. it isn t that there are female heroes nor that they want to  represent  female heroes. the problem is that they think it is a necessity! that disparity   discrimination. that is the problem.there are correct ways and incorrect ways to represent female heroes. doing it through ideology. not good. that s the main issue with the m-she-u is they are replacing plausible story line and source material for a  modern audience .
l supremacy
please double down and replace thor and spiderman with snowflake and safespace
you are quality of anna.   that  star wars girls cutie.  chech her out.  she contains self respect also.have a great day.darryl gene  fami y of harcourtoh damn .... soryy ... aint no  not sorry.  .... i just be honest ... i am proud of you.
hi puppy!!!
i agree with you melonie we definitely need our male superheroes back because i ve had enough of this constant feminist propaganda that marvel keeps on doing and treating the men like trash i really hate mary sue characters  makemarvelmaleagain
leave black widow alone! lol!
someone needs to make a movie with a feminist villain and a man crapping on feminism in a hero role
the death of the tomboy - https   www.youtube.com watch v sbwoyu8_isg ab_channel sydneywatson
whats a  pick me
better  make marvel alpha again  ditch betas.
the new avengers kang dynasty looks like all the male characters are going to die  once they fully femminize the mcu it ll die.
there are awesome female characters out there  but the way they re represented now in media is awful. we don t need to be pandered to to have a good time and enjoy something. it d be nice if they would just get a clue and go back to how things were originally. stick to the source materials  you know
get stronk marvel
please tell me all this agenda pushing stuff in the entertainment industry is mainly the american society. i don t leave my house much so i don t know has it reached europe too and if so to what degree.  d
i swear i am a big time x-men comic fan an if they rebrand an change the entire title cuz it has the word  men  in it. i m officially done with disney marvel movies cuz that s just disrespectful to the fans  the creators jack the king of comics kirby and stan lee and the actors that watched an read it growing up. sheer stupidity at its finest
...it s like with most things...it s undemocratic...the people making the product are unrepresentative of the people buying the product...people who assume the people making the product are people just like them...
i want juiced up super heroes with veins bulging from their biceps with hair on their chest and be freaking men and i am a straight dude lol i don t want to play watch games and movies with people like me i want to play as an idealistic version of me. for that matter  bring back sexy women too! like women can look like women and be total bad     tooo my goodness.
make marvel male again
mcu just stopped caring cassie in any man created a quantum machine from hanks work like it was a lego set lol.  they literally don t even try with the women characters they just make them incredible because they are female.   i have always loved women in marvel cartoons and comics but the mcu does them no justice at all whatsoever.
that s why i unsubbed from knights watch. they brought a woman into a male space where i had always enjoyed just hanging out with my dudes. they ruined it!
a girl who goes out of their way to impress boys and make them seem that they re  not like other girls.
the marvels could do good if they do it right and it isnt just more man hating i mean we do have female heroes so i am find with them but like i said no man hating please    it just makes the movie bad and they didnt man hate in the comics!!
how messed up is it that people call  normal  women names for liking masculine men    you cannot make this sh1t up! lmao! i ve had people in comments call me  toxic male  for just my appearance...to which i laughed and replied back  you should see me in person  im 6 2   230lbs  and could wipe the floor with you...but im actually nice  unless given a reason to not be  . to ridicule women period goes against their ideology..but they love to give themselves exceptions when a woman thinks and acts independently....and actually prefers men the way god intended them... it s clown world lol
they fucked up thor in end game so bad
at the end of the day  whether you are man  woman  or anything in between  we don t need this woke ideology shit in our media to represent us in our stories anymore... we fans just want cool characters  good story    no more gender hate. period!!
i hate to be bringer of death.. according to future movies . and games  it s going to get worse. as the god  of war.. i throw my blades to the ground
what s a property in this context  you keep saying property  are we talking about real estate property
what this is about is to destroy the concept of a super hero.  one way is by making a mockery of it.  steven spielberg thanked tom cruise for saving hollywood.  hopefully this means a new beginning.  this reminds me of a movie where a woman can be a super hero without supplanting a man s role  edge of tomorrow.
whats wrong with a pick methat just means women got competition
evey day is a new day.remain honorable.every day. as have you been.as i seen such.keep it up baby.  daughterthank you  babe.have a great day darryl gene  family of harcourt
how about if you wanna see yourself in a movie  stop complaining  and make your own movie already.
mcu melonie mac go boom failure tv and movies
um  not many male hating feminists watched she hulk either.
i try to as masculine as  a 65 year old dude can be lol
i dont care if they are male or female i just dont like when they have a female they turn her into some man hater and use the movie to hate on men cuz i dont mind seeing a bad ass female in a movie but the man hating needs to for sure stop
i m sorry  but the world doesn t revolve around you. you can t just have things just because you feel like it. accept the way things are and move on.
tom girls that look like women are the best. who doesn t want to fish and hunt with their old lady  lol
i actually liked strong female characters before. now the female characters are all just so toxic that they ruin most shows movies.
wait so you re l  ha
people read comic books
i am so lucky that i am a manga anime fan for 25 years nowcause we are safe from this god damn bullshitjapan just does not give a fuck and i love it
there is a whole genre of same sex women romance in japan. they are definitely woke over there lmao
@chocochib  having a same sex story in itself is not woke thoit s if the only reason it s in the story is to  inclusive  exampleif you would write a character thats gay  and the only way you can let people know that is by having everybody comment 24 7 that said character is gay  thats pushing itbut if you can write it in a natural way that is not forced or pushed  in a way that lets the readers figure this out alone  you just wrote a gay characterhaving it is not the problem  but pushing and forcing it for the sole reason of just having it  thats the problem
@hanayama-san  your standard for woke is subjective  there is no set rule on what is woke and what isn t  so even if it it isn t pushed its still woke to a lot of people.
oooor you know actual females that act legit like females  ..
whenever corporations are entering an existing fan base and they ignore that fan base i always wonder what their goal is  because if you re having a superhero movie or a scooby doo related show you clearly are trying to attract the existing fan base so why would you then screw with that franchise so much that it becomes unrecognizable to that fan base or even worse actively insults the fan base   like who is the audience for that  it s not the existing fans and the people who aren t already fans probably won t be attracted to it. so they have to advertise the c    out of it by saying look at this super feminist woke thing to try to attract the super feminist woke people at the same time as insulting the existing fan base if they don t want a super feminist woke version of their favorite franchise or comic book or game or  whatever
i can t wait for one day when women join the nfl for all of half a second before they realize there is a reason why things are separate.
it s tragically what happened to star wars.could have been so much more  but because of woke and financial greed   they couldn t respect to true original carictors. the last jedi is unwatchable because of the female dominance roles.so disrespectful to the original movies.
they will probably turn lara croft into a trans women
is your cat prego
@  x                                   not falling for it you fake scammer
i understand your thumbnail for this video  but i don t mind captain marvel. i don t think she is woke  i thought that was a good movie. in fact  i find her quite sexy. at least in her first movie and the begining of avengers endgame. speaking of which  to me  all marvel movies and shows after endgame were....crap....crap......mega crap....  insert james jonas laugh from spiderman 2 .
instead of being good they want to be political. that s why marvels new stuff sucks and its going down fast.
finally  a melonie video without any trashy steelers apparel. i mean what kind of weirdo likes the steelers anyway. clearly the superior team of choice is the bengals.
we need things to be normal again  i m sick of all these activists invading our spaces and pushing propaganda in our entertainment.
the joke is that these hard core woke new generation outraged feminists don t go to these movies. what s the point
i m ok with female superheroes or athletes or ceos or whateveri m not ok with belittling men or replacing men
when will marvel and disney get it....the more powerful the female protagonist gets  the more boring they become.they get superpowers handed to them too easily and conveniently....they never really struggled to earn it.
the marvels could ve been good  but you know the focus is going to be on the diversity and identity politics instead of an actual well written movie .again
ah  the fifth ninja turtle  venus. what a trainwreck.
what is the great tribulation   can you explain that
ain t nobody can beat son goku
i wonder if not having a black widow all those years was so we wouldn t be clamoring for more and more of a good female hero instead of the feminist captain marvel types they planned for
i don t know about you guys  but all of them look goofy in their outfits. don t matter if they tone down to a darker color customes. like for the woman  you gotta atleast have some muscle tone otherwise i don t see believeling in the character. just simply makes them look weak.
he-man woman haters club is alive and well from the posts on here. lol
at least you didn t say browns  but this is still gross
@melonie mac go boom  yeah yeah yeah  go cry in your terrible towel  p who dey!!
not buy the comics  games or merchendise. but they might tweet their approval.
i have a lot more studying i need to do in revelation  i m not the most versed on that part of the bible  but to my understanding that is when the antichrist and the beast will have bee revealed and times are gonna be really tough for christians when that happens. i don t see enough biblical evidence to support pre-trib rapture  at least at the time i am writing this   so i don t think christians will be exempt from all heck that is gonna break loose in those days
melanie.. i  heavy things to say   it s just complicated to talk about
facts!
w!
i m to a point where i will not even consider a movie or show that is female led anymore.  i just don t care anymore. too many 120lb women kicking 250lb men s asses in these shows and movies.
bring back glorifying feminine women and masculine men.but yes  tomboys and sensitive dudes exist too  and that s fine. we do not need every character to be androgynous or some weird special identity magnet. just write good characters and stop trying to milk
they never will.  move on.
i hate to pre-comment. did you get a chance to see the communist propaganda the last of us was pushing last night in episode 6
remember  feminism means all woman think the same! you cant possibly disagree! right
not a tom boy but i am a man and i m sick of hollywood marvel making men soft and women super strong i don t even bother watching any of the latest marvel movies since end game it s all too woke
a pygmy   why a pygmy  what s apygmy have to do with this video.. please someone educate me ! .. lol..  it s cuz i m a frigging boomer.
fake thor daughter  cosplay hawkeye girl didnt even wait for his real daughter  fake ironman girl didnt even wait for tony s daughter  three female marvels  she hulk  female thor now dead at least  female loki  female antman daughter  female black panther  another female black window bc sj got old  pepper technically  and man  idk if thats all of them or not.
the last good mcu is infinity wars and the mcu died with stark
eyyy the l pullover what s up. yea the femboy fad is all over the place.
give em an inch they will always always always take 10000000 more miles  yours truly  leftists and transvestite community. thats them.
melonie  i say this because i care about you.don t watch rwby.
maybe i m missing the point but she-hulk has been around longer than melonie mac has been going boom.
lol zoomers boys are all snowflakes  thats why there arent any new zoomer male heroes despite the overwhelming amount of female zoomers in the cast  all taking over already established characters
i like the thor series but i will refuse to watch love   thunder. marvel is condemned to fail. marvel parent disney will fail. the new little mermaid will fail.
wait  a pretty nerdy tom boy that doesn t hate men  say it isn t so! the irony of female super hero s is they were created for males. sexy female super hero s always appealed to males  they were never meant to empower females.
she was bored with episode 1 and hasn t watched any since then.
pick me! meaning i want you to pick me!
marvel is done  just like anything purchased by disney it will be dismantled in quick order.
thumbs up just to the headline. i don t watch any marvel stuff after phase 3. just a bunch of blah blah girl power. there s no heroes to root for anymore. after all  females don t make mistakes
i don t have a problem with either  and vice versa  but it s all just not believable and balanced anymore. people are individuals  handle things differently  depending on gender but even more so age and experience etc.these  modern  characters all look and act like genderless gen z kids and it s so annoying.
yeahbut marvel was bought by disney in 2009 and the only movies from mcu that they haven t supervised were the first iron man and incredible hulkso...with being dismantled quickly...in your opinion it took them 12 yearsis it quickly
@pan piernik  good point and you are right for marvel.  however  it s really only the past few years that they ve gone hyper woke.  what i really meant to convey is that the current modis operandi for disney is to ultra wokify everything in short order.
you called mel
not all tomboys are men hating lesbians....
make marvel great again. .  my first girlfriend was a tomboy.
put trump in the mcu.
just to clarify this stupid thing goku vs mcu captain marvel goku one shots her and if you don t believe me go watch a video about power scaleing goku then try and tell me that mcu captain marvel s best feat isn t blowing up some space ships
i never watch or support tv shows movies game s that push the men are weak and bad narrative itis why i quit wow
w
there are girls who like male things and males who like girly things. that doesn t mean those women are men and vice versa. it s stupid out loud and the people who continually try to push this nonsense are not worth your time or attention.
who the hell are you and why you so based !
good writing and a better actress would fix a lot of the crap surrounding captain marvel  but i do agree 100 . less toxic femininity and more normal masculinity would be nice. shed the woke and the soy.
according to the left  tomboys are just lesbians or transgender in waiting. ironic.
marvel has always catered to both genders  the problem is virtue singling   bad writing of characters  trying to get things out all the time rather than taking the time to produce quality  and social justice warrior antics. men have never had a problem with strong female leads... men don t really think about gender when considering a cool hero. that is something that women do... if the story is cool and that action is good men will like it. but these days they are shoving a crap character  poor action and then telling us that we are sexist if we don t like it  while at the same time pretending that this is the first time any woman anywhere has done something like this...its just bs and men hardly like bs
i think you are wrong.... even the man hating feminist didn t watch she-hulk...everything else you re pretty much on point.
people that agree need to boycott marvel. that simple.
i would rather just not support anything disney ever again. even if they made their ip amazing somehow  anything they own is permanently dead to me going forward  i won t even watch it for free. better to just remove disney from my life entirely than hope they might make something good for star wars or marvel  those things are already dead to me now  just like real marvel comics. if this is how you treat the ip i would rather abandon my childhood nostalgia than support a bunch of woke losers who hate me anyhow.
marvels poster looks so stupid. i hope it bombs at the box office.
she s right  you can t have a female ninja turtle...feminists can t come up with new ideas so they just destroy old ips
mcu creativity equals zero
she-hulk was a whiney rich woman who hated men who complained she couldn t keep a man.you cant keep a man because you hate them and treat them like trash
make writing good again. make female characters actually cool again and not the girlboss feminist dominatrix bs. make male characters top dogs again  not soy boys. i can go on all day.
actually their is a female ninja turtle
no one likes marry sue characters
we need men leading not women  is not appealing in super hero stories
melonie  that was incoherent  you need a script before you make a video.
i hate the replacement of male led characters by women... makes me avoid the remaining marvel movies.. i disliked wanda vision and everything after....
just stick to anime. my hero academia and one punch man surpass anything marvel or dc have done in the last decade. then there is always the og dragon ball db  z  kai  super etc ....lots of tough  masculine dudes that serve as positive male role models for boys and men of all ages. zero wokeness. zero agenda. just good all fashioned high-powered action and adventure  prioritizing entertainment over everything else.simple as that.
instead of complaining about games that do not have enough feminism  make your own games.
get rid of brie larson and make it the focus on miss marvel and the photon character those characters are good and treated nor al like men
marvel is dead
i don t care about their genders  marvel is shit for at least 10 years now lol
this is very cringe
i don t see it happening yo. marvel movies are dead. enjoy phase one and bin the rest.
i think marvel is dead
or  maybe you could not insist that men have to follow specific stereotypes and gender roles just to please you  seriously  can you get more sexist then this !
i rather watch a decent film instead of the dumpster fires as of late that includes the flat ass disappointment of brie larson better known as captain marvel i couldn t give a rat s ass about captain marvel or the marvels something related to brie larson a quote randy orton marvel cinematic universe version if you get my preference without that alien blood transfusion you will been a complete nobody
first!
yawning.. what was the point of this video   make marvel male again  we already have like thousands of comics  video games and movies of male.. i think the female rise was long overdue
why is she not my wife. get over it ... boy.  lawfully present she. prevert
simple answer... recast all women characters as men.  first  replace wonder woman with wonderman.  marvel buys dc and makes shazam captain marvel  to solve the naming problem with shazam.she hulk should be he hulk.  after that  get rid of all women and make all marriages gay.  when the secret wars happen  just have a guy world take everything the guy universe.woke is a cheap excuse for too much bad content.  if it were all gay  it wouldn t be great either.please get a sarcasm detector before replying.
first
marvel was better then  before the radical leftists and woke activists took over disney. also the new women james bond is gonna suck
was it now
i bet you like the expendables franchise! disgusting! lol
most marvel movies are god awful trash. even the ridiculous avengers movies.
shut up! i like being the toughest guy at the bar! let them be sissies.
they ve been doing this for a long time in comics.  just get over it.  you didn t live through the years where men objectified women and abused them obviously.  comic books were essentially pornos for teenagers.  i think it s a welcome change.
lol. clown
