i just want to say well said! i have never watched you or any of your vids before  but i have been looking forward to the game for a while and think its ridiculous for someone else to have the right to tell me what i can and cannot play. i appreciated your views  and agree with them 100 . just want to say thankyou for being open and honest and standing up for yourself and encouraging others to do the same. thank you!
