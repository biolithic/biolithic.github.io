jason momoa just made the greatest decision of his career. also glad you re feeling better melonie.
don t fire jason   fire the people who wrote the script and the narrative directors . they are the ones who make it woke in the script.
i really want to see jason mamoa as lobo in a good movie. it pains me that this ll never happen.
jason momoa needs to be in the new war hammer 40k show. him and henry cavill would be really cool together.
so glad to see you back at it! things just don t feel right when you re down and out. but i m glad you took time for yourself and rested. i ll be continuing to pray for healing and deliverance for you
okay this stinks first we lost henry cavill as superman now we re probably losing jason momoa as aquaman and those two were perfect for those characters in my opinion so it s going to be interesting to see how this goes i guess
glad to hear you re feeling better melonie! as for aquaman  momoa was actually pretty good in the role and if he is leaving i can t blame him for leaving this shit show!
well are any of us surprised by this  i am happy to see jason standing up to this stuff if it goes anywhere means anything that s yet to be seen  but it just takes one person to get other people to stand up and do the right thing
dang at first i didn t think he would make a good aquaman because of his looks but after seeing the movie i loved it and his performance. i m glad more actors are taking a stand
we ve gone from a culture where the higher-ups cared about the fans  to a  fuck you  i ll do what i want and it s your fault if it doesn t do well  culture
happy to see you back  mel. don t push yourself too hard.
hey melonie. i m glad that you re doing a little bit better. it s good to see you
run jason be free!
i hear ya on struggling to get over a sickness melonie. i also hear ya on being a fan of jason. agreed  seems like a real nice dude. big fan of a lot of his stuff.
makes sense because the fans sure as heck have left.
better videos when you re sick than most others when they re well. hope you feel better sooner than later.
oh no. what will we do without him   he brings so much as an actor .
hey melonie i am happy to see that you are feeling better and so happy to see you back making these great videos again. anyway i just want to say that i think that jason momoa did a great thing of leaving the movie bc it is hard to stay acting same character for same movie for couple years and i think that he will be fine with doing some other movie roles like this upcoming fast and furious 10 movie and some other movies that is coming up this year and beyond in future  ok melonie. anyway i just want to tell you that i think that it was a great thing that he left movie role and move forward with doing some other stuff and things in his life in future. anyway i just wanted to tell you my thoughts bout this video for today and i just want to tell you that it was great to see you back making videos like this video for today and this week. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also hope you get feeling better soon and fast too melonie. anyway have a great evening and good nite.
it s a miracle they made one good aquaman movie.  expecting a good follow up may be asking too much -- especially from can t shoot straight to save their lives dc.
hard agree on the underwater fight. it made me think how it would be like the jedi purely using the force in a fight.
bout time he started getting his shit together. lost faith in him after the whole amber heard drama
all that 100
if they make more adaptations of the dune books  he s set for a long while lol.
@servopedes  and atlantis season 6.
to late  he should have refused to work with amber heard.
@albert nada retro  and who are you to tell him or anybody what to do  pathetic
it s mostly the producers who push writers to make the stories so bland and shallow
i thought that gunn wanted him for lobo anyway.
he s not getting fired he s walking away meaning he s quitting.
@john durham  i would love to see that... he would ve been perfect as lobo
well that would mean firing jason as well since he says aquaman 2 is largely based upon a 50 page treatment he did for the story... and i ve seen him speak publicly about the global warming message so clearly he wanted it in there
he s leaving  not being fired.
they re the only ones being given gigs.
don t fire him from dc  just make him lobo in the reboot.
@craig whitley  this is what i said. he s the one that came up with the idea for this sequel
yeah after the first time i heard about it i can t imagine another lobo. i didn t really like him as aquaman  maybe because i m old enough to have grew up with the comic cartoon version
seeing him as lobo would be wild as hell. totally fun and wild.
its happening.
they should ve done that from the get go honestly.
james gunn wants him as lobo
fun thing is about a couple weeks ago was discussing with my peep  without having heard anything  that jason momoa would actually look great if he was cast as lobo. he can definately play a crazy badass space motorhead bounty hunter. mah maaan !!! and he has the looks and the build for that role.
lobo is going to be like domino reverses black and white. i can think of a few people who could pull it off. of course they changed the continuity of everything to be over-inclusive and  diverse  why are there more blacks than mexicans and asians  because the 15  is louder. but  hey he pulled it off. he s got that i m really nice till you make me angry vibe they did make him blondish d
dc is gonna screw it up.
@damian nightwalker  you know that domino is pretty much a goth chick with dead pan white skin and a black mark on her eye  right   on one hand i don t care about diversity  just give us a good story with good characters is what matters first and foremost. the obligatory and forced diversity in everything and where sometimes shouldn t be and doesn t belong is death sentance on having something unique and really diverse. in dp2 case though  not gonna lie  i was sceptical at first with reverse race swapped domino. however  the atlanta actress was so good on her role  well written and both a charming and badass character  as domino should be that i didn t really care in the end if they race swapped that character. because she didn t break the movie at all. and honestly  i think that i actually liked her better  being a little bit more comedic and sassy at times. domino is kind of a grim character most of the time in comics.
while i would like to see that i have no faith in dc to make good movies at all.
@mybeautifulandamazingprincess  that s such a bad argument.  hanging out with an abuser but he shouldn t tell him to do that. replace amber heard  with bill cosby and see if you hold that same sentiment
@truer words have never been spoken  my princess!  what does me not liking someone for endorsing her bad behavior and me being a good person having anything to do with each other  nice way to deflect since you don t have an actual point
i highly doubt it
don t worry they ll make more garbage  and blame the fans like they always do   no accountability in current-day entertainment. while they push there twisted views and messages.
it s just the way the studio and gunn want him to go because of how they got rid of cavil.
jamesgunnmustgo
i thought this when i saw him in face paint prior to his crow movie getting nixxed.
he could totally play leman russ
nah  i want to see him as angron!  d
thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  i know how you feel  suffering with the cold too  get yourself some sudafed  that s what i use
@daniel turner  let her eat fruits   cinnamon and those magic spices  non of that pharma stuff.
i loved that picture of the two of them on the red carpet. cavill tall and poised in his expensive suit  mamao lurking behind him like a giant billy connolly-looking fun gremlin. summed their public images up perfectly.
mamoa will be better as lobo. seriously.
a full recasting of the jl is needed at this point. i have faith gunn will make the right choices.
no one s taking a stand. the thing to remember with actors is that everything they say goes through their press agent  which means that everything they say is fake. momoa isn t leaving aquaman because the second movie is bad. the first movie was bad. why didn t he leave then  the truth is likely that james gunn isn t going to bring him back as aquaman anyway  so his agent wants momoa to jump off the sinking ship before it fully goes down.
i haven t but sure you speak for all the fans right
@cody  not all  just the fans that have a life
@s d soda  yes you must live a great life
the only ones left are normies and simps.
aw shucks  thank you
@melonie mac go boom melonie  there s a urinalist that s begging amazon to stop making lara a  huwite savior . love to see you dismantle this dude. i love the polygon lara than aloy... i mean reboot lara.
the road is clear for him to be the main man himself
i liked aquaman. he did the show  see  and that was really good too. she says  oh i m a mess . dang  if this is what a mess looks like  wow.
rip to the aquaman universe...
the aliens are coming to destroy us part had me laughing.  since in that world they got superman alien  zodd vs superman stuff happened. then darksied and friends all aliens .
jason s a beast  always great vibes. you sound better  hope you ve been doing well and had a great weekend.
man  life comes at you fast  you just gotta be jaded sometimes.  i immediately thought of the line by ferris bueller when you said that.
all the art based inspirational works from comics to now need be given to arthouse directors. turn things on their head and also give to people who can interpret art better than someone like gunn    .
make sense from a brand perspective. if he sticks with the sinking ship  he ll find it more difficult to get high-paying roles in the future.
he ll be back as lobo  hopefully ! that and swamp thing is the only part of gunn s new universe i m wanting to see! also  new reports point to henry cavill being railroaded all along!
i don t think he is leaving because this movie is bad  i think the rumors are true that he is going to be lobo in the new dcu.
i actually fell asleep in the theater during the first aquaman. first time that s ever happened.
i m glad you are starting to feel better. because warner bros doubled down and put amber heard  with 20 minutes of screen time  i won t be seeing it. plus they seem to have forgotten that movies should be escapism and if you subtly sneak some message in   that s fine. just don t beat us over the head with and spell it out blatantly.  to serve man   form the twilight zone series is how any aliens would act. go rest. and if i may  even under the weather  you look beautiful. may god continue to bless you and keep you safe and well.
happy you re doing better. i know how it is when you don t get so k often  then you do get sick and it kicks your ass.
this is honestly funny af. lmao
good on him. finally an actor with some balls.
hope you get better soon melonie  good to see you making videos again! aquaman 2 sounds terrible.
i have always wanted him as lobo since day 1. but you know....... btw thank you for bringing in the content! you are a trooper! just got a cold myself lmao
glad you are feeling better   but this is a major red flag at least for aquamarin
glad you re feeling better after getting over the kung-fu  the holocough  the sweet and sour sniffles.
this was a fun watch.  i hope you get well soon.
i highly doubt he s leaving.
how come you dont want to see anything else of james gunn   james gunn is a brillaint writer.
bullshit. the first movie was awesome
@dcmastermind first  nope. it was just another mcu snooze fest.
you didn t miss a whole lot. people talk-explosion  people talk-explosion  people talk-conversation interrupted by explosion.
there s an article about how an old doctor who story  the green death - political storytelling done right   told an environmental message properly  vs the recent trash fire  orphan 55 . it s all about subtlety and nuance  without treating the audience as stupid.
i laughed so hard just before making the video lol!
@melonie mac go boom  i honestly thought it was because of amber turd. xd
hes going to be soo good as lobo!!!!
glad you re feeling better.  i thought they were gonna try casting him as lobo.  entertainment all messed up these days.  man they re all running around in circles on a square track.  mwuahahaha.  i was a fan of jason s since stargate   atlantis days.  i was one of those peeps who saw him in a movie and was like  hey it s that stargate   atlantis dude.  lmao
i understand what you mean about tomb raider  i feel and felt the same way about velma  that and i knew from the leaks it wasn t going to be a good show. glad to hear your back  i believe your healed in jesus name!!!!
i hope you get better very very soon the sooner the better. i be praying for you
even though he didn t look the part  but he was a good aquaman  and since he doesn t want to do that character anymore. let him do lobo!
had to finish up some work before i could watch the video  melonie. love the inevitable tomb raider detour    i ve missed your videos this week. always brings a smile to my face.looool just got to the climate change bit. i m rolling also so glad i could help you find something for a video. get well soon.
wasn t he let go just like henry cavill since they are rebooting the entire series
hope you get better soon mel
it s speculated that he may play lobo in the new dc universe of films that hasn t even been confirmed though so i m not sure
how about that. jason mamoa is based.also i m glad you re back in the game. hopefully  you ll get over your cold soon. also you look great today!
this further confirms that mamoa is going to be lobo. during one of his stream posts on social media  he says    im so excited guys i can t talk about it now but exciting things are going to happen in the dcu i love you gunn and safran  not sure if that d the whole qoute but that s the gist of what he said.
hopefully you ll get much better melonie and just like you i m a big fan of jason mamoa and i ll be watching aquaman 2 as well
well  jason momoa  as lobo is fine.after all  he s the only one who can.
i m with you. aquaman wasn t amazing but i enjoyed it for the most part
feel better melonie!
okay  but what is more important  nick is still right about jason  thenoseknows
we  you melonie!
melonie   inserts rant about aliens into a jason momoa video also melonie   i m too sick to come up with anything riveting.
wow  it was probably his biggest role yet he quit  speaks volume about the movie  dceu isn t dead tho  since it never really was alive...shazam and aquaman were the only dceu movies i really liked  well  guess it s all about it then.thanks for your updates and keep up the good work
i thought i would hate aquaman  but i loved it. i watched it 3 times with friends. it sucks to hear about the sequel.
he was in baywatch back in the 90 s.
@josh potter  when i watched baywatch  which wasn t too often  my eyes were for some reason distracted all the time.  i can t even remember any of the stories of any episodes.  lmao
@argin_1  well  that s completely understandable.
i don t care if he has different beliefs  as long as he s cool and acts so positive all the time like he does i ll be a fan.
you re my textbook definition of trophy wife. i hope you find a nice guy with which to reproduce.  would that it could be me. maybe in another life.
congrats!thanks for watchingsend a dm through the platform above .the package is yours!!!..
i can t fault momoa for this movie s problems. i haven t seen everything he s been in. but what i have seen hasn t been disappointing. if he is leaving then it s probably because he doesn t feel confident in the movie runners righting the ship.
jm is holding out to play lobo  which he would be perfect for
i find it hard to care just because i swore i wouldnt see it because of herd and that hasnt changed   momoa has lobo which is awesome   as for ezra  right now we dont know how the film will end  and like the comic flashpoint it could be a deus ex machina to get shot of him but i dont think they could afford not to put the movie out
it is good to have you back!!!
melonie   we are with you homie   and every time i click on one of your videos  like 9 times outta 10 i know you re gonna lay down some awesome content  so within the first few seconds literally of seeing any of your videos  i have to give a thumbs up to that  like  button automatically  as your perspectives are great   mucho appreciated  thanks
for real. why can t we get rid of ezra. and of course climate change. i could see jason as lobo. this video did make me laugh a little. believe it or not you look amazing melonie. i hope you get back to 100  soon. but take all the time you need to rest.
i almost wonder if some of these last few of the slated dc films are being intentionally sabotaged since they re resetting things. it sounds conspiratorial  i know  but gotta admit  it s an odd pattern.
well  whether he is aquaman or lobo  he ll still be friends with dolphins.
yeah i think that the facts are bit misleading considering that he is in line to play lobo which has been said by jason to be his dream role  and that he is going to stay on as aquaman so there is a lot of misinformation out there and i hope that jason leaves this sinking ship.
jason momoa wants to play lobo. so  he probably wants to turn his focus that way and let someone else be aquaman.
aquaman was great. but the ending with manta was anti climatic. i m guessing that s what the plot of this movie will be.also idk if mamoa is leaving the role becuase of the movie or becusse he wants to play as lobo. which would fit him the best. i guarantee you it would be a better choice for him.
i adore how she just has to bring tomb raider every time
still looking and sounding a lot better  melonie! to be fair  jason momoa was awesome as aquaman - perhaps one of the reasons that aquaman became bad@5  again! he also did great in slumberland   rest up now.and continue to go boom!
hope you feel better. take care
this was a rollercoaster of an episode.  you went from aquaman 2 may suck to space moloch gonna harvest your organs.
maybe this turn around has something to do with the larger shakeup the dcu is expecting under james gunn  like they are pre-emptively calling it bad so momoa can more easily slip into the lobo roll praying you continue to recover and can get back to normal life!
it is sad we keep losing all the perfect actors for these dc roles  like losing actors  that seem like they were born for the role
lobo vs santa claus is one of my all time favorite comic books. i can dream.
hey  melonie! have a wonderful day     glad you re feeling better.you look fantastic  btw.
hope you get better soon  i had the same cold  lasted 3 weeks. sudifed 12 hour cold meds helped a lot
because apparently the flash is just that good of a movie that they need ezra.... but i would argue that batman is carrying that movie.
@dragoner productions  batman is the only part i like about it
@the real stephentv  definitely.
lol we re not losing anyone.gunn has literally invited everyone to stay on for his reboot.gal is staying as is miller  levi and affleck too.
ginger tea and black tea
i thought jason momoa did a good job making aquaman not lame af.also nyquil is the bomb. nyquil! you can t have a cold if you re not conscious!
the rumors of him leaving after aquaman 2 are nothing new. personally  if the rumors of him being lobo are true. that will be pretty cool. feel like he d be better in that role than him being aquaman.
weird how these companies keep getting rid of actors for terrible movies but never the woke writers or woke directors that are directly responsible for making these movies terrible. weird
melonie eating cough drops like chips get well soon!
he s leaving it for 99  to play lobo which he s always wanted to play the other 1  probably has to do with it was going to be the end of that anyway due to the reboot of the dcu so add that to the fact that it also has been chopped up several times and hundreds of reshoots and overall when you ve damaged a movie that much it s going to be shit. but mainly it s because he wants to play lobo always has and now he s going to get his chance the movie just being terrible is an added benefit and another excuse
get well kiddo we ll be here when you get back.
i think it s a lie. they re putting this out there that the movie is bad that way peoples  expectations are super low so when they watch the movie it ll seem even better than it would ve normally. hollywood does this crap all the time.
severe stress from life events that hits you all of a sudden and lasts for a few days  or more  will always weaken your immune system to the point where you get sick. it s happened to me a couple of times  so not surprised you got hit with it. take the time to heal up and get back to normal. we want you healthy and happy  d
lobo jason could be cool but we need henry  too
glad you re better now  miss melonie! agreed  jason is a likable guy and all  but the whole climate change thing is a bad joke. him jumping ship from this series is a good thing  because without him it s nothing and he d be a perfect lobo. imo  if there s aliens out there  my opinion is that they re actively avoiding us because we re crazy violent primitives governed by our emotions and too prone to destroy that which we do not understand instead of learning about it first.
i think jason momoa would be better off playing lobo. he got the body  the attitude to play the main man. just as long as the lobo film stays rated r.
so if there s test screenings the movie is done  so how is he leaving  if he s already done the movie  i m sorry to say  but he can t leave it s already done. is it gonna go back in time and stop himself from making it
sorry to hear you re sick  feel better girl.
johnny depp must be break dancing after hearing this news
mental image  jason mamoa leaving a party  saying the food tastes horrible. melanie  staring  food untouched   awww  why
there s this brand my old boss used to use in a call center called  fisherman s friend   that stuff packs a punch and you usually only need like 1 tablet.
i say  good for him!
they still have time to fix it. it s all in the edit. if they care enough totally agree that aquaman had awesome cgi and effects. not sure why it seems to suck today
hope you feel betteri agree with you nothing can get me in that movie theater to see the flesh. dc is a sinking ship. everything i ve heard about the tomb raider show sounds really bad it s something i d really love to see you cover.
as dennis leary said about nyquil   it says  may cause drowsiness.  what it should say is  don t make any f---ing plans .
i ve been loving all the sleep
congrats!thanks for watchingsend a dm through the platform above .the package is yours!!!...
perfect time to work on the next season of stargate atlantis
but hold on. i thought he is the one that approached dc with the story idea for this sequel so he is also to blame
i watched aquaman because of jason momoa. his version of aquaman is enjoyable  entertaining  and badass. still going to watch aquaman 2 because of jason momoa  just like i m not watching the flash because of ezra miller  or anything james gunn comes out with because of how he treated henry cavill. but that s my take.
can t be as bad as namor in wakanda forever  but i agree in today s movies the writers aren t doing a good job.
ezra has pronounce privileges  momoa doesnt
hypothetically if there are aliens  the one you re thinking is a worst case scenario  like the warhammer 40k way. as a jaded  self-loathing  self gaslighting  to be honest it s mostly all i have ever known  that teensy bit of optimism in me hopes they are more or less the mass effect kind of way. especially if there is on that is like the crazy headbutting uncle we never had. i just don t want to be disappointed for once.
good for mamoa at this point. liked him fine as aquaman  but i honestly hope the rumour about re-casting him as lobo next is true. i remember being genuinely shocked he wasn t announced as lobo in the first place.of course  that means no cavill s superman agains mamoa s lobo ever either. at least i ll always have that meme photo of them on the red carpet.
kinda unrelated to the video but!i am so glad i found your channel! i found out recently my iron levels were suuuuuper low. you ve inspired me to eat more red meat! i still kinda eat everything but have added waaaay more meat to my diet and am feeling so much better! thank you for the inspo. also really appreciate you sharing your faith! it s encouraging to see a fellow gamer   woman   christian
welcome back  mac-attack!
when i get a cold i wear a hoodie  cover my head  and i always get better.
feel better queen!
jason mamoa made aquaman cool.
i d like to see henry cavill as the punisher. i think it could be awesome.
im on almost 3 weeks of a sore throat so i feel ya....
he was already said to be done as fishguy to play lobo was he not
the first one was good...sad to hear this new one might not be up to that standard.
so this is actually happening. after all the comments he made abt no one else will be aquaman
yeah  they might just can it entirely and just make the flash the reset point. also   i m excited to dive into this.  an aquaman pun  ehhhhh   d
good job. feel better!!!!
very understandable. wb has been complete clowns with their movies  and actually keeping that freak ezra on payroll with all the shit he s done is mindboggling.
they d have to explain his massive steroid use since then lol.  maybe it s ancient super drugs ..
we already have a good punisher
after flash comes out they will part ways with ezra . no way they are doing it before.
keep up the good work love you
ezra is in the circle of perverts that are protected.kinda good to see momoa isn t in the circle
nice keep up the great job
my opinion on some cinematography to be studied and used in fantasy films more - dagon  h.p lovecraft story  - come and see  war movie  the reality of imagination is sorely lacking in most dc and even marvel movies. even joker movie - nowhere near psychotic enough for an adult movie. get a japanese director to make it so it s more like  itcy the killer.
melonie was that woman in the snyder cut who  as he swam away  took jason momoa s sweater and sniffed it.  proudly fly that freak flag  melonie!   and have some chicken soup for that cold!
0 43 i immediately related lmao
the cold  still body of the dcu is getting another kick
hopefully more and more actors and actresses leave hollywood  the current hollywood just keep making garbage after garbage  actors like jason deserves better.
10 48 thank you for this and god bless you. it needs to be said  it s great to hear someone in the gaming community tell the truth and exposing satan s deceptions.i m a little distraught though  i thought you quote a bible verse before  at the end.
as much it sucks that jason mamoa will not portray aquaman anymore he can be lobo now
so sad i loved aquaman 1
i dont care how woke he gets...   mel  me too. i am a simp for jason momoa lol!!!  shame
hope your 100  soon  wife s just going through stomach flu atm  2 days in bed and counting
get well soon
i m confused. is momoa bailing because it s bad  or are the bosses kicking him to the curb because it s bad  or is it all just bs rumors  if i m going to take a  scooper  seriously they d better have a really good track record.
i enjoy all of your videos and it probably has something to do with the visuals lol as you are extremely easy on the eyes. hope you get to feeling better and that your throat feels better soon take care of yourself enjoy the videos love you laters
he s jolly  yo  there s this epic comic book series  or graphic novel series  about santa claus someone must make a movie and cast momoa as santa   that would be sick. it s called klaus btw  i forgot to mention that.
i hope you feel better soon
darn  i rather liked him in the role.all the best to him.
i wouldn t be surprised if jason is dipping out because of what they  dc  did to henry cavill.
he is clever  he is saying he is out before he gets the cavil treatment.
aquaman 2 tested a bunch because they ve done a boatload of reshoots. cavill cameo added in then taken out. affleck cameo added in then taken out. so reshoots for both cameos and then more reshoots to change things because the cavill and affleck are out as superman and batman. guessing aquaman 2 will be a mess of a film.
i took  a heard  this morning in honor of aquaman.
melonie mac upload a new video swweeeet have a great day sis glad ur feeling better u look so amazing
i m not surprised that jason left it .i hope soon youlll be feeling better.takecare melonie
melonie  remember  no simping.
wouldn t aquaman want the world to be covered in water  he is the lord of the underwater areas. more water rising would mean more area to rule. also means fewer land dwellers dumping toxic stuff in your home. double win.
bye  aquaman. welcome  lobo!
certain producers loves to end someone s career over bad movie s  their team of lousy tv movies writer s  and senile directors.
so what s up there in the starry sky  we can t be alone in this milky way galaxy and especially the whole universe.
mamoa is leaving the aquaman role because james gunn is casting him as lobo.
glad to see you back with us  mel  take it easy   rest up good  can t wait till you stream again p.s. they re out there...
jason following henry  i see. they need to do their own project together  now. it d sell like hotcakes.
weird...i would ve presumed he would be exiting because they seem to be exiting all of the zack snyder cast
man.. its so dissapointing we are losing amazing actor s who fulfill roles so damn perfectly due to crappy writing... cavil with superman geralt  momoa with aquaman and im sure there are plenty of others
@melonie mac go boom welcome back and you re looking great rocking the tifa lockhart look again xd.   i thought the 1st aqua man movie was good.  its the closest we will ever get a  rifts underseas  movie.  its a cool rpg series  you should ask me more about it if you like rpgs.
aw hell nah  you did not refer to jason momoa as  daddy
well if they are going to get rid of henry cavil they might has well get rid of everyone else and find new talent and the fan favorites has new rolls  like jason has lobo.
hope you feel better
why are people saying this  is she sick
@truer words have never been spoken  my princess!  yes she s sick
don t do no odeeing on the nyquil! lmao
they should of reworked the flash movie and just edit out ezra miller or have him killed off or something and then the legendary michael keaton portrays true batman once again and just kicks cheeks.  oh and he s like  kinda sad the flash is dead but immediately moves past it within a scene  id love to see that movie.
so they going to pull a marvel and make amber heard aquaman..
hey melonie so jason is leaving aquaman  well if he finally leaving  maybe  he could make kratos in the new gow tv show it could work right
they should have made the snyder verse
you know what they say  laughter is the best medicine  stay jovial
i am still waiting for a new season of stargate atlantis.
henry cavil comes to momoa and says  ever heard of the warhammer initiative
i ve always taken vitamins my whole life and it works. it depends on what you take and where you get it from  but bio-trust is a good source. those athletic greens look amazing and have everything you need  but its a 100 bucks a month. i get the greens from bio for 19 dollars month. i have a lot of gut problems so i take a few things for that as well. but anyway the greens alone  if taken every day will help out big time and get you over shit quicker and help prevent sickness. it s a blast of nutrients.  if i didn t drink a 12 pack of seltzers 4 nights a week  i would probably never get sick  but i like to drink. nac is another good thing to take in the morning and at night. so the only other thing would be pro-biotics for stomach health  which the stomach can affect the rest of your body health. anyway try the greens if nothing else and through bio-trust they have a good blend that is not expensive. also it doesn t hurt and is cheap to take vitamin c and d several times through out the day. b-vitamins also help a lot  but they are in the greens that i mentioned. i hope you feel better and if you happen to read this  i hope it helps if you decide to take my advice. and  just for the record i have no stock or sponsorship in that company  i just think for the price it is the best deal.
if that s what being a mess looks like  i wish i looked like a mess everyday!
get some potatoes and fuzzy slippers  you ll feel better in no time   great video as always  thanks.
we know the old dcu is getting a flashpoint anyways. i ll wait for gunns dcu to run it s course first  i m hopeful.
i once watched a video of jason momoa thrwoing axes and drinking beer.he seems like a decent enough dude. i haven t seen him post anything  woke .
it s likely for two reason. 1. backlash against heard2. gunn pushing him to be lobo instead. wb is screwing so much up. we ll never get a cooler aquaman again.
get well  @melonie mac
don t worry  they ll probably have ezra play all dc characters lol
he s filming aquaman here in new zealand  right now.guess what s happened the last few weeks here  in areas he s been   a major cyclone. that s killed a dozen people and done billions of dollars of damage.our second in recent history. hawaii where he s from has also shared the same threat of climate change  the pacific islands are on the front lines of these catastrophes  being majority coastal populations with low elevation above the seas.there s a major tsunami or cyclone ripping it s way through the pacific every few years now. and disrupting millions of lives.him having a jet is irrelevant. him having family or freinds in the path of tsunamis and cyclones is   and always on his mind.
jason momoa is famous from star gate atlantis people forget this
if the same cold i got for xmas  found you  i slept for basically a week  and wasn t really back on my feet  for a month. what doesn t kill you  makes you stranger  i mean stronger
in all the universe how can you not think there are other worlds with life on them
i guess mamoa is regretting cheering like a school girl when leaving wb exec office at the promise of an unneeded sequel. hey  he got paid but damn if it isn t embarrassing.
if he becomes lobo  momoa will have the character lecture us on climate change as well.
my  0.02 is that they probably didn t provide him enough children on set  so he left.
jason momoa would be good as kratos.. also it be awesome to have a non marvel thor  that has  top vfx artists  that have time to make the movie no wokeness.. just make a good movie and everybody who work on it.. get paid fairly
the stuff you said near the end
if they really want to do a good job they should have made the sequel about aqualad being orphan from another kingdom and aquaman spend time with training garth to being a hero right amber heard s character off script until they recast her and they would have. been fine
odd.  momoa was  at one point  dead broke.  yet he is  apparently  now well off enough to turn down work.  heavens bless ya  dude.
jason mo  hes just s  likeable... and stuff. ..i mean what a likeable guy.
love see someone like channing tatum take the reigns for aquaman.
he should have been casted as lobo from the start
if he is playing duncan idaho in dune he will have work for a very very long time
the cinematography in the first film was good.  realistically you wouldn t be able to see that far clearly underwater  but it looks nice.  but given what i know now  i will no longer  be going to any films with amber hear or ezra miller in them.  i don t support dangerous psychopaths.
someone told me i look like the wish version of jason mamoa. hahahhaa
hey melanie if you take airborne and tonic water it will boost your immune system and help you get better faster. works for me
i m super sick too. it s been about 3 days and it just keeps getting worse
i wouldn t be surprised - the biggest shocker is ezra miller s flash and aquaman 2 still being released despite their awful protagonists  let s be real  amber heard was basically the protagonist of the first movie .
here s gunns  opportunity to outwoke marvel while he can. give us ah as aquaman going forward. not many people expect the new dceu to finally work out anyways  so might as well make it a spectacle. they could even work into the plot that momoa got lost while swimming to china to tell them about climate change
i feel like the tank top is more like a name tag.
jason momoa didn t want to be the next captain planet with aquaman colors! they might as well replace amber heard with greta thumbergi suspect the fact that man s carbon footprint is less than 4  of earth s carbon  which is less than 4  of the earth s atmosphere won t be mentioned.hope you feel better melonie!
this just turned into a thirst video for melanie over jason momoa lol
he is in like fifteen tv shows right now  lol.
oh god no
my friend always liked thor so when love and thunder came out on streaming we watched it and like 30min in i fell asleep. gave black adam a shot and fell asleep again then i decided i m done with superhero movies. i ll only watch a darker grittier one.
he s leaving because he wants to star as lobo in a future movie and james gunn won t use the same actor for two superhero franchises  so expect this to be the last aquaman movie.
isn t aquaman part of the old dceu  and its going to get scrapped anyways under james gunn  mamoa want s to play lobo in the new dceu.
it d be super hilarious if at the very beginning aquaman loses a battle because his face gets covered by plastic bags. then we get his un speech.
jason momoa is leaving aquaman because he s been cast as another dc character   so this is just smoke
i don t mean to be weird by saying this but... melonie is absolute wifey material.
i thought aquaman 1 was the best dc movie in decades. how they f d up the sequel  good lord
i don t blame him. most movies and shows are going to ish.
cool ink work on your sleeve
well there goes my last reason to watch dc movies.  first henry cavil and another mamoa !
try chamomile tea for that cold. it s an antioxidant and it helps relieve inflammation and all that junk.also if aquaman is that bad then maybe it s best to pull a page out of the batgirl playbook and cancel the release.
maybe this ezra miller dude has dirt on people  it s wild that they keep this character around.
hope you feel better soon
jason should have bailed as soon as gunn confirmed they were reworking the entire dceu. he deserves better.
momoa  sadly another lost cause.
hope didn t blow your senses apart with those suggestions little lady
it s not mamoas fault if the movie sucks  he didn t write the story - he just acted the script that was given to him.
with all the chaos going on at dc  i won t be surprised if there is a lack of enthusiasm for some of the upcoming films. i heard shazam 2 hasn t done well with ticket pre-sales.
never cared about the heard situation because imo he abused her and she abused him. they were toxic it is what it is. i didn t like the pitch of this movie since it was announced to be a buddy cop movie between aquaman and ocean master. who thought that was a good idea. that being said  the magic of the first aquaman was the relationships between aquaman  ocean master  mera and the queen. it should always focus on relationships when it comes to aquaman and atlantis. this is what happens when you fold on your plans with snyder to try and speed up to catch marvel instead of sticking to your guns and building your already established universe in its own way.
feel better my friend
her tats r  ngl
i won t watch anything with ezra miller. that dude can barely contain all of the evil spirits running through him.
honestly melonie the reason aquaman 2 is failing is because it s a rehash of aquaman 1. for god sake they are just reusing bad  guys  for the next 3 and a half hours  should have just turned this into a tvshow with 2 or 3 or even 5 seasons. it could have at least given amber a bit of work and  should have been more like game of thrones   where we get to see a lot of underwater politics  betrayal s   new villians and proper fan service like seeing aqua lad and on top of that they could have  added more dc villians doing mischief with black manta and what not. i don t mind amber heard because she s sexy fan service  i know some people would be like go watch hentai if you want fan service  but i m going to pass on that one.  and besides as a christian  i forgive amber for what she did and i want her to be saved and in heaven. trust me hell is a bad place  it s not the fire that s bad  it s what the devil does to people s minds over there. i ve reached a point in my life where i would rather love my enemies and neighbours than be in hell.
melonie you just made nyquil cool for me. maybe you should chew gum or something in your videos idk. i enjoyed aquaman too. it s a good dc movie in my opinion. hope you feel better soon.  james gunn be tweaking in the wrong way.  i agree. those cough drops lol. hahaha
don t want momoa as lobo  lobo shouldn t even be considered until the new dcu is on firm footing hahaha never going to happen led by the one trick pony that gunn is .
welcome back
he s leaving aquaman because gunn wants him to play lobo.
i said it plenty times and i ll say it again... mamoa as aquaman was such a misscast... i like him very much and i would prefer to see him as lobo... i honestly can t imagine person that would be more suited for that role than mamoa.
maybe he is also  a little salty about what they did to cavill
it doesn t seem like dc is looking to cut loose jason mamoa  it seems like jason mamoa is cutting and running from aquaman because he wants to work with james gunn and wants to be lobo. regarding ezra miller  this isn t a situation where someone has to go and why not ezra instead of jason  these are apples and oranges. the flash movie is testing very well and aquaman 2 is testing poorly. nobody is looking to cancel mamoa. that said   nielsen steaming data shows that the first aquaman is not getting multiple views the way that virtually every mcu film does on disney  or as the batman films do on hbo max in spite of the box office success of the first aquaman film. and as someone said in one of the comments read aloud  in terms of quality  the first aquaman is not a particularly good movie and could be seen as a fluke that benefit from timing.
jason momoa as lobo
vitamin c  1000 mg in the morning  1000 in the afternoon.  after you get well  you can lower the dose to just 1000 a day.   you will barely get a cold again  and if you do it will be very mild.
if they can just recast jason momoa as lobo we can just toss it on the ever growing pile of evidence that james gunn was lying about not wanting to confuse fans by recasting cavill as superman in the reboot. what could be more confusing than recasting an established actor in the series as a different character  i mean  in fairness  he would make a slightly better lobo than he did an aquaman  but by that logic  why not now dye cavill s hair blonde and cast him as the new aquaman  i mean fk it  why not  we might as well get crazy with it. cavill would make a damn good aquaman in my opinion.oh yeah  we can t have that either because the real reason cavill is the only actor who was told to go kick rocks is that gunn is going to wipe his ass with the entire franchise  turn the entire dcu into a big inside joke  and cavill can t play because he s an actual fan who will call out gunn s bs when he sees it  and that makes him  hard to work with.
i just think its insane that amber heard is in this movie...
jason had a foot out already in the first movie he hated amber heard and the direction of the dcu. now he can t even be bothered... and i don t blame him dc is a clown show.
lmao love the project blue beam!
get an echinacea tincture for next time. as soon as you start feeling sick  you take a dropper full every other hour. should nip it in the bud. bone broth sounds good though. silver hydrosol also works well. never saw the first aquaman  so definitely not watching the sequel. the only real sequel i m interested in right now is alita.
when it comes to amazon  it could be a good show or a bad show. amazon has like 12 studios making tv shows and movies. i wouldn t rule out tomb raider out yet. the last tomb raider movie was a stinker.
i thought he was simply switching to the lobo character.
soon as i saw that dc supports abusers  i decided that i would no longer be purchasing anything from them. doesn t surprise me that a company that does this can t make a product that s worth a crap.
i have a heavy  press x to doubt  on this rumor. this same screen testers also said that batgirl was the greatest dc film ever. am i going to see it in theaters  fuck no. warner bros has actively protected amber turd and ezra miller from consequences.and as a consequence  i will not be giving them money for any project featuring them. also  ubisoft is worse than ea and activision.
let me guess  he s been neutered  and since amber heard has too much drama  they ve instead raised the profile of aqualad as a mighty  non-binary black  because they have to make our men feminine  warrior
jason is going to be lobo.
first one was pretty terrible too  but hunky lead being manly was well received by the ladies.  the first one was dull too  even the action scenes were meh
get well soon
1st. hope you feel better soon.2nd. aliens are real. i m from jupiter.  it s a nice place to visit. 3rd. i now live a bush light beer and a small bottle of 99 from somewhere as i clean up the litter in my yard from the street that goes past my house.4th. most important!! keep drinking water!!stay safe. take care. have fun.
is there actually something we  as people  are supposed to do in order to avoid climate change  i feel like i heard a million times that climate change is bad but i never heard what we re actually supposed to do about it...recycling  walk to work  i feel like doing this for the rest of my life would be equivalent to taking one teaspoon of water out of the ocean in an effort to dry it up.
great video !  hope your stalker gave up and rethought his life. exercise that 2a!
i think jason will be better as lobo.
maybe it s not just the movie that s terrible  but also the process of making it.
good move for him. he can get away from the stench that is ah. the rich and famous talk about climate change and yet everywhere they go  they have a private jet. the prince and princess of wales fly commercial because they are into climate change  and they follow up on what they believe.
i ve been a jason fan since stargate atlantis. hes an awasome acter and to be frank based on the special features jason while not a conservative was also not really  woke  either.
jason momoa  gal gadot  ben affleck and henry cavill all gone  but ezra miller still in place as the flash....
why these  conversations aren t happening with ezra miller   great question. you don t have to believe james gunn  but he stated   the flash  is one of the greatest superhero movies ever made . gunn dcu think it will make a lot of money but they expect the aquaman to bomb. you have a movie starring momoa  a sweet guy almost everyone loves  and in a movie starring miller  a very creepy guy almost everyone can t stand. the dcu needs a profitable movie  they think the flash is it  and that aquaman will lose money. that s all it s about. i still think miller will get fired  after the flash finishes its run.
he s swapping for lobo
hey! lets get rid of henry cavill! probably the most liked person in the whole gaming community as well as the most liked movie star!awesome idea james gunn!do you know what  whilst we re at it  lets keep amber heard! probably the most disliked movie star ever!awesome idea james gunn!and whilst we re at it again  lets keep ezra miller! you know  that freak cult leader who goes around abusing people and getting arrested!do you know what james  you sir are a freaking genius!jason mamoa  yeah  no i m out.
aquaman needs to be a blond dude in orange and green armor with a big gold trident!  i like momoa but he ain t aquaman and never has been  in my opinion.
great video melonie
the first aquaman movie was awful  yes  but it was bad in a good way. i have no problem with a movie being bad as long as there s still enjoyment that can be had from it. ghostbusters 2016 was just bad  with no enjoyment. the first resident evil movie  i thought  was bad in a good way  and i love watching that movie. i thought angelina jolie s first tomb raider movie was bad in a good way. so  it s okay for movies to be bad as long as they re enjoyable.
lol i highly friggin doubt he s leaving.
i m calling you out woman of god  you know us christians should care more about forgiveness  and that  a sorry  is enough because god doesn t see what we did but he sees what we re doing. rather than care about what other people think who cares what he and amber heard did  if god can forgive us then we should forgive others
the same guy who criticized pratt for taking a picture at the gym with a plastic water bottle... promptly trying to sell him a case of his special mamoa brand water in aluminum cans.    i lost all my respect for him back then.  and that was before he got the boot after defending the turd and was living in his camper. a ford f450 luxury camper worth 750k. that gets 5 to 7 mpg. a fully loaded camper that costs more than the average home... and we were supposed to feel sorry for him.  nope. i loved his role in stargate atlantis and in aquaman 1. ill pass on the climate crisis hysteria.
doing great
too many alternative media voices get this point wrong  so let me be clear they say stupid shit like  i m glad zack snyder is gone  the snyderverse dceu sucked! then  with the same breath  they ll say more stupid shit like   how could  aquaman 2  be bad  just do what you did the first time! it ll be fine!  aquaman  was only good because zack snyder had producer oversight on casting  character arcs  story direction and choice of villain.  aquaman  was only good because of zack snyder  period.you remove zack snyder  and preserve the woke walter hamada bullshit that followed  aquaman s  successful box office run with flop-after-flop  and congratulations! you get the gunnverse dcu.all we re going to get from the dcu from here on out is shit shit shit shit shit.
jason is a great actor but the movies he s been in are really bad. he needs a new manager because he has so much potential.
love to see dc still copying marvel. chris evans was human torch now he s capn america
i am a simple man.what entertains me entertains me.i have no intention of watching propaganda. i have been watching every planet in this solar system go through planetary level changes for 15 years.the sparse atmosphere of pluto  blown off.the atmosphere of neptune  flash froze.the polar storm of saturn stopped and changed direction.the eye of jupiter storm that is much larger than our planet completely dissipated and then reformed blowing the opposite direction.the hurricane dust storms of mars appeared 6 months earlier than they were supposed to this year  or ever have in known history.literally every sign points to a magnetic polarity shift on a solar system scale.as for earth  no. the  former  poles have more ice this year than last year. but that s the problem. the n s pole are accellerating towards each other to meet in the indian ocean   all projections state this planet will tilt by 90  in the next 20 years with a new pole forming nw of south america  in the ocean.  same place unheard of amounts of ufo s have been witnessed for decades at which point the natural tilt of the earth back and forth will absolutely create a brand new north pole of ice and south pole of ice due to how the polar vortex magnetic storms interact with the atmosphere each winter  per respective pole  and the fact that magnetism itself controls temperature. at the same time what used to be the n s poles will melt and break apart filling the oceans with glaciers yet again.
sure it wasnt covid   had some similar symptoms a few weeks ago.
superhero movies is one trick pony  i understand that for females watching momoa can be the same that for men watching a beatiful and talented actress but if there is not a good story   a good script or even good acting or good casting  then there is no movie. i stopped watching superhero movies   since iron man 2. because honestly there is nothing more in there.    don t take this personal  these are just my thoughts on the crisis we are suffering from every angle of our decadent society  this comes from film industry  i think maybe you should start to evaluate another type of cinematography and you will discover amazing movies that probably you haven t watched  and send a clear message to the people on the industry of entertainment that we want culture  not garbage indoctrination  and i know i m sounding preachy and annoing  but at least i m honest if these corporations treat you like that it s because you allow it  superhero movies should be something casual one or two big releases a year but the fact that there is people out there that would pay a ticket 8 times a year to watch the same movie with a different spandex man  says more about you than something about the greedy people who profits on you.  i use cinema for entertainment but i like to be refreshed with new stories  i want to be surprised  i want to be scared or i want to have a laugh   but seeing a guy to save the world   sorry guys i m tired of it  i loved it and still  because as a kid  i embraced the values that those comics  movies and tv series promoted   those were the same values that my parents and school  put inside of me  but now as an adult   i move on and  i don t need to going back so often  i mean if a good and i m talking a good story of  dc comes out one year   and the same year another good marvel movie comes  well maybe i watch the two  but first and most important  they have to be good  if they aren t don t waste your money  if a third movie comes using the same formula don t go to the cinema  leave that for kids  you can always watch it at home  if you feel the need  but send this message to the industry being an adult not a kid. stop complaining if they make garbage  they make it because at the end you will pay. and that is the problem. stop being the child who loves thor and be an adult.  sorry but it is what it is. i had to say it.   that is why channels like melonie s or nerdrotic  or heelvsbf are important   they make the effort to put some information out there  but these channels can t tell you what to do. it s good to have an opinion from different people  but at the end it s up to you.   ps. and of course  don t trust red tomatoes or imdb.
this cold picked the wrong hufflepuff to mess with !
compare aquaman to game of thrones roles for momoa. sure he s learning to act better  but like art school - it can take away the spark that makes you different and amazing. drogo role on got leaves aqua-doosh in the rearview mirror
it s ok  it s ok  dont panic. we still have our aquatic queen amber heard  right  right !
he left because he didn t want to be associated with amber turd.
i m glad to see  that you re getting better.i m going to be honest. momoa is a terrible actor to the point  that he s not even a thespian  he just plays himself and is the go to polynesian for hollywood. but he looks like a likable man  who seems to be woke  because he was married to that cosby show broad  who is completely nuts  and wants work.
get woke go broke
momoa is better suited for lobo. its better for him in the long run
please stay safe and get your 12th booster
oh oh melonie is nyquil tripping  keep her away from the robitussin.
i honestly thought melonie was in her early 20s
that is a funny way to say he was fired by james gunn  just like henry cavill.
go check out suspicious observers here on yt if you re not already familiar.
she s better than you
@truer words have never been spoken  my princess!  i do not come in here to have arguments or get angry. if you re actually a real person  have a nice day.
please tell me you re joking.
@iso-didact  i d second that in the most respectful way of course haha
jason and henry out.  ezra and amber still allowed in.  great job dc.
he is leaving cause he has another role as lobo
it s tanking because it s soooo woke
it s as if they are trying to remove men from cinema in general  all the bad-ass men are now  just gone. henry  jason  drax  chris  chris  chris...pathetic.
implying james gunn wasn t going to fire him anyway.
it s funny how she try not to watch at his muscles..
happy wednesday melonie mac
mild spoiler well he has dune to go to anyway
him as lobo is going to be bad
aquaman vs captain planet
zack snyder s dceu where the first solo films for the characters are great but any sequel or team up is terrible.
melone  do you have any thoughts on the asbury revival
ok..if he does he does.... don t make it a big deal
he has to quit because they won t cancel it. the last thing jason momoa needs right now is to be the lead man in another blockbuster flop. mans is trying to save his career lol
yep cuz of ezra i refuse to watch the flash movie and will go to yt and watch the keaton scenes
hey  here s a crazy idea i m sure hollywood s never heard of  fire. amber. heard.............why is that so hard
momoa is ok but plays himself in every movie.
that s  sad
first aquaman was a good fun movie. shazam was a fun movie too
good. make better movies that are worth his time.
a bit like the rock or vin diesel
@g. a.  i wouldn t say that about vin diesel.  riddick is very different from dom. and there was a film where he played some mobster that was a very different performance for him.  he even had hair in it!
ahem groot case closed.
that s not a bad thing. comes out natural.
congrats!thanks for watchingsend a dm through the platform above .the package is yours!!!.
amber heard  dey took our jerbs!!!!
i don t know what yall are talking about. the first aquaman was amazing! it and shazam were the only good dcu movies holding it down. i hate people and their stupid opinions. this is why i don t go with other peoples reviews. i will just have to watch this movie when it comes out on hbo and judge for myself along with the new flash. like neither of these movies are probably gonna matter if they are just rebooting the whole thing for the thousandth time...
hear me out  replace  ezra with... barry keogan.
he s becoming lobo instead
melonie is simp n again for aqua maam hahahha
didn t jason momoa want that movie to talk about the woke climate change nonsense  the flash might be the last dcu movie i watch if they don t get it together.
coca cola for sore throats and coughs.
til melonie is huge tomb raider fan...whaaaaa   get well!
i suggest emergen c good for fighting a cold
jason for the win.
i will believe in aliens when i see there space ship or them.
he needs to get back to making conan movies... by crom...
he is gonna leave a sinking shipgood thing aquaman doesnt need one
do you love x-files melonie   i am begging to think you have taken a bunch of smacks to the head like have.
cosmicbooknews  might as well be wegotthiscovered

i have a cold too! feel better.
aquaman 2 and the flash are doa.
daddy s getting angy kitten
i don t care how woke he gets. a few minutes later  complains about him being woke about climate change.
rofl
dc always a hit and a miss
ezra miller is still here becuase flashpoint is too important movie for planning dcu reboot. after that  all old actors will be gone and future for dcu becomes even more clouded.
i doubt i m going to  see anymore of the hero movies. i feel like i have seen everything at this point.
at least jason momoa is away from amber heard.
how did director james wan screw this so badly!  from the enjoyable first film to this!
remember what they did to henry cavil
i never understood the point of nyquil. take dayquil and go to sleep as you normally do
i blame wb and amber turd.
hahaha the dccu is already falling apart.
if amber is there and miller is there i m not interested in watching.
we lost henry cavill to the best role in dceu and for absolutely butt f    no reason other than they want a young superman story and theres tones of that already we need something better than that...henry even announced his superman return just to have it shot down by james gunn ugh...he is not doing good right now im telling you...i think gal gadot might even be canned as wonder woman too like this dude is making some fans pissed like myself....
is everybody getting a cold  because i m in nc and a lot of people around here are sick
smart man
it s pointless for the live-action justice league team to stick around if ben affleck and henry cavill aren t allowed back in. dc is all over the place and unorganized with their movies
they are trying to kill the last good dc movie before gunn does his... best
well he might be saying that but it s not true he s leaving aquaman because zaslav has fired everyone in the dcu except apparently the flash but every other character is being recast. so keep believing that jason it s not true you re leaving because you are fired by zaslav.
sorry melonie  you had 911 likes but i had to give you 1 more.

pretty sure dayquil has some sort of stimulant effect.
@ioncewasmikey  there should be no caffeine in dayquil. i m sure there are products that do have it though
@christian s  might not have caffeine but i think it has something else that s supposed to help keep the user awake. doesn t acetaminophen even have a stimulant effect
i d be very surprised if miller keeps the role after the upcoming flash film. seems all but obvious that movie will be the reset button for the franchise.
100  next will be aquatranman
yes! my thoughts exactly i will watch the keaton scenes on youtube. i will not support ezra or his crappy version of the flash.
dive into it! ha!
but he doesn t because of amber.
yeees  very likeable  that must be it
i love mamoa but i refuse to see aquaman because of ah  i never watched the first one for her but wanted to support mamoa.but he will be great as lobo so i m looking forward to that.i love michael keaton batman but it will be a no for me  they keeping miller and throw in keaton to bait ppl  i m not going for it either
not my ariel  lmfao
better for him. yes  he seems to be nice  and that s why he should leave. they lost henry c  fired j.d. but they keep the turd  the crazy flash guy and annoying people like the rock or the shazam guy. imo gal gadot is cool  but wb went insane. they should replace most of their management  and some of their core actors. but they keep the actors they should fire  and fire their good actors  so better for mamoa to leave  and focus on something more productive and promising. but imo they totally rely on people liking the actors  because their writing is bad  their plot is bad  and it s a shame how they exploit them. good movies should build up their actors career  but here good actors are everything the movies have to offer. it s a shame
i suspect ezra miller has a lot of dirt on hollywood s ruling class.
these companies had a gold mine with comic movie s and they actually blew it by making such garbage storylines the poor writing story plot and over use of absolutely awful humour has ruined the content.
super hero movies are just overdone these days. did like the batman tho. it wasn t over the top
i still say it was horrible casting for the character of aquaman.
i won t ever be watching anything with ezra miller!! dude should be in prison!!
wow. i was so sick i made you sick through youtube. lol
the current temperature outside is -13.
smart girl.
tbh i wanted to like the movie but i don t support heard at all so i m not watching this at all.  i hope dc gets it together though
daddy    boy oh boy
no  he s insufferable. no  aquaman 1 was thash. trashier than... trash  wow. get well  soon. best wishes from copacabana  rio brasil o
good. he would make a better kratos. amazon pick him up!
aliens   demons
leave aquaman and play lobo
before all the woke race swapping aquaman was what a blonde white guy ....so now it can be chris hemsworth and make sense
corporate are absolutely clueless how to make good movies. this is baffling when all they have to do is research the dc story archives  pick one of the greatest stories told and adapt it to the big screen. no need to reinvent the wheel. superhero movies are going down the toilet fast.
they spent so much time and effort and money to make aquaman cool  aquaman is a success  screenwriters decide  what if we make him... un-cool. again.  and studio agrees  shame...
does jason momoa even have a private jet  that shit is for wealthy people  not even just rich people. lol
math 7 18  a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit  neither. can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

jason momoa once flew on a private jet to the phillipines to lecture their government on climate change. their president told him to get lost. when i heard about this i lost all respect for that hypocrite.
so  i get a reply from yet another telegram scammer  i ve started reporting them as harassments instead of commercial spam  youtube is going to have to start taking this crap seriously.
i dont know why they casted miller when they could just have used  gustin from the wb flash he plays a great barry allen the writing just sucked
i refuse to wtch anything with ezra miller in it.
it really bugs me that you pronounce  aragorn  as  eragon . there s a difference
this is hilarious. 24  but since you refuse to listen when i call and no one pays attention when i stretch out my hand   25  since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke   26  i in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you  i will mock when calamity overtakes you proverbs 1 24-26
he should have been lobo  not aquaman  what a terrible casting decision.
like who   his good looks alone gets him by..
if aquaman 2 is so bad that people are walking out of a screening nobody there had to pay for. goodness. for them to say this is the worst dc film to date  look at all the bad that has come from this company and tell me how to feel about that. wow.
wb needs to get rid of the dead weight james gunnta-nehisi coatesj.j. abramsezra milleramber heardmalcolm d. leewill they do that
have some soup it helps
i really like jason since i discover him in stargate atlantis  his character save the show  but i will never going to watch a movie with amber  turd  in it  the same goes for ezra miller s the flash  i sorry for michael keaton but i don t support abusers of any kind
they can t learn from the marvel now that it s gone all woke-kandad
dc should just stick to animated stuff.
the truth is  dc and disney hate their alpha male characters......and chased them off wether its this dude   cavill  or hemsworth
isn t jason mamoa super left wing and anti-right wing  or did he change  i just remember him saying 2 years ago that he wants all right-wing people to unfollow him on twitter.
i didnt like the first aquaman  jason momoa is an odd actor in that he is very likable and charismatic but he doesnt translate all that well as a blockbuster star.
i like jason momoa as well  but have you seen the videos of him touching his daughter inappropriately on camera  it was pretty cringe and disappointing to see.
i am calling it now.. flash will suck and aquaman is actually very good. i question the viewers...
the only way i will be watching the movie is if they completely remove amber heard from it.  if she shows up in it at all  i m a hard pass.
it seems that they have no interest in aquaman or any of the snyder  characters for that matter.i ve read the book of revelations  so i know how the whole thing turns out. guess that s why climate change doesn t bother me.
jason has made nothing but horrible movies so this is a surprising excuse used
oh my goodness did we just go down a rabbit hole of fairytales and conspiracy theories  smh
i m not ready for woke emilia clarke character  angelina in eternals was almost painful to watch.
jason mamoa is the man  and aqauman 1 was not bad  for what it was  but let s not mince words here. aqauamn is the lamest jl founder. he was always the butt of the jokes in superfriends and he s kinda dumb. the dceu is so sad when aqauman is carrying the team. you get water dude right  but not green latern or superman  tf
the new flash movie looks horrible  im not gonna see it
nope  i don t buy it.james wan has never made a bad film or at least not a film as bad as they claim this to be.
reduce the size of your facecam. you seem to want to have the focus be on you  instead of the topic you re discussing  or whatever articles you read through.
musk should buy 20th century fox and gather up all the hollywood cancelled actors and make movie s again
jason mamoa is a bad actor to
to be fair all movies have been pretty terrible for the last couple of years.
maybe he s leaving because the turd was mean to him. not as good as the first  well that s not good  i mean the first wasn t a terrible movie .... but there wasn t anything really special about it either ... i had to wait half my life for them to care enough about comic book movies to make good movies with the material. and now i dread them. fire all the damned activists already. nobody is going to aquaman to see al gore tell them everyone is going to be dead in five years if we don t stop using fossil fuels 20 years in the past.
you think in the vast universe  there s not any other life out there  nowhere in the bible is that stated.
climate change  for sure it s true  but it doesn t change  all of that became a huge industry. look at bio products. people are willing to pay far more for bio to feel good. it s the same with climate change. electric cars for example totally rely on that. a lot of the ressources are from china. so it s a huge industry  there is a lot of money involved  and a lot of stuff they promote won t help the planet. the destruction just takes place in other countries. but that s how companies and greedy people are. they lie  destroy and exploit...
the cinematography in aquaman was awful.   all that gimmicky  fast and furious camera movement the ugly cgi sunsets ugh.  gonna have to agree to disagree.
woke film is broke film.
i like jason mamoa but if you really pay attention to his acting  he is such a bad actor.
okay momoa  fuck aquaman. go play lobo now!
just remember when people lecture you about climate change are they spending money to protect you  cities towns and neighborhoods from the climate.
her hotness does not outweigh her whininess.
cough drops and nyquil are not carnivore! booooo
this is why i don t care about movies anymore. i never cared for tv shows. i ll just stick with my video games. you guys can have this hollyweird nonsense.
jason mammoa  is a weak actor . i fac5 some of his roles are so alike and annoying
jason momoa is just so.........1 note. so boring. hes like the rock. they re themselves in every role.
what are you talking about aliens aren t real   i know exactly where aliens come from...genesis 6 and the book of enoch.
he s not a good actor. he can only play dudes who growl or scowl a lot or surfer bros
one piece is better
jason momoa can t exit a project that was never going to happen. did people forget this and the flash movie are the end of the dceu
is it me or does he only take white girl sidekick roles
why ezra miller  coz ezra miller is the  modern-audience  version of jesus!ironically  momoa is closer in looks to the mainstream jesus  image than miller  d
jason mamoa is a democrat.    now people on here will hate him....
nobody really thinks the guy has a career with dc after the flash movie  do they
@ioncewasmikey  that is what worries me. if  the flash  makes it big  and there s a chance it will coz of micheal keaton  they might try and work him up into the james gunn dcu. i hope they ditch him though. off all the people they kicked out  eza miller should have been the first one out.
