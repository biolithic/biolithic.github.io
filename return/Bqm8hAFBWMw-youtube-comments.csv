I know its been said  but it really is so refreshing to see a young lady not afraid to speak about her faith and personal convictions. reminds me to examine my own heart as well. thanks for all you do  melonie!

thank you for sharing your faith. I went to a Christian school and by the time I graduated I had stopped reading my Bible or going to church. its been a very long time but you got me to start reading the Bible again and Im starting to look for a church.

this is the woke world we live in  we need to fight that  those of us who see that they dont make sense have to speak up  which is why I am surprised in a great way and glad I found your channel

I like how you give a very realistic view of what being a Christian is

please pray for me if you can. anyways you have a blessed day.

and on another note  joshua 1 9 was exactly the verse I needed to hear today  so thank you and keep up God s work

great video as always. I watch mainly for the Bible portion of the video but Im also a gamer so its all good. Im at a point in my life right now where Im not sure where to go or what to do. life is just stagnant at the moment. I keep wondering what God has in store for me next. Im ready for that next step.
