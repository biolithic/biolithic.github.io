they scream about climate change and when a real ecological disaster happens they either down play it or ignore it. money and politics folks  that all it is.
get this to who needs it  a guy i work with who i knew was originally from cincy told me today that his son tests water for a living. he told me that cincy takes their water treatment very seriously and have upgraded their facilities numerous times over the last couple decades and his son has worked in water treatment as his profession for years.he told me that his son showed up to work today and a female  gov  agent was in office. he was instructed to go north up the ohio about 40 miles and test randomly all the way down through until kentucky. the woman was to ride with him which had never happened his whole career.they rode together to the first testing area and when he dipped his hand and cup into the water without a glove the lady asked him...  you re not going to wear a glove  . his son asked if he should and she said  i wouldn t touch that water without a glove. he said on every stop depending on the angle you looked at the ohio that it looked like an oil sheen on the surface and noticed dead fish at nearly every stop.they ran the whole day and when he went to test the samples the lady basically said that she d take it from there and that they would let them know what they found.his supervisor reached out to him over the phone from home later that night and basically said that he couldn t give him  details  of the tests but that he advised him not to drink or even bathe in tap water for the foreseeable future.just thought i d let everyone know what i was told
my brother is a chemist and he said the same thing as your chemist friend.  this is a major disaster.  get ready to help strangers.   donate garden space in a safer area. bring vegetables  eggs  from your garden or land in the back of your pickup and donate it to the victims of this disaster.   prayers for everyone.
as an east palestine resident i truly appreciate your concern. we are highly suspect here. we are getting no clear answers. we are feeling sick. our mental health is fragile.
i am a disabled vietnam vet from agent orange.  heart  diabetes  and hypothyroidism.   i am very well aware how the united states government likes to cover up mistakes and environmental problems are just one.  i could go on with nuclear waste problems that also are not solvable.  think the yucca mountain saga.  i am very  very sorry for the folks in ohio and downstream from the water ways. it equates to a nuke explosion in scope.  my humble advice to those people withing range of the pollution is to give up now and leave the area for good.  there is an old expression    the first rats off a sinking ship are the best swimmers.  i would be one of those swimming rats right now given my current health and believing the united states government fifty years ago.  i would pick a spot at least 1000 miles away upstream.  and start there for moving.  yes  you will lose your home in ohio but you will anyway later on.  would you rather leave with now without fatal health problems or in two years with them   and the same for your kids!
i live in ohio  about 3 hours away from the derailment area  and the local news coverage is scarce and what they do say is that  the water is safe  the air is safe  nothing to be concerned about   the epa is testing everything and nothing is showing up .  i personally do not believe a word of what the news says. i pray for the people of east palestine ohio. this is a major disaster!
i m a disabled veteran and have seen many things. today i had a chance to have a quiet moment. in a matter of a minute i started silently weeping from my eyes. what a downfall our country and world has had!
this was chemical warfare being deployed in our country.  this is not an accident. it was fully intentional!  god bless everyone!
those poor people. leaving or taking a vacation isn t that easy if you have pets and livestock. since their property is now worthless  where would they get the money to do either. the fact is that our beloved government is conspicuous by their abscence  i hope a lawyer will step in and help them. please father help your children who have lost everything  or soon will.
my biggest fear is what if this happens again  this was deliberate
thank you for reminding people to trust their instincts on this.  point blank  it s not safe.  it s erin brockovich level  or chernobyl level not safe.  i am praying for all these local people of east palestine  ohio.
an interesting note for you  some of the train cars were carrying  phosgene  or the related agent  most commonly used gas in wwi 1917 1918  mustard gas . there is no other use for this chemical but to kill troops in the trenches during world war one. the most commonly used gas in wwi was  mustard gas   bis 2-chloroethyl  sulfide . in pure liquid form this is colorless  but in wwi impure forms were used  which had a mustard color with an odor reminiscent of garlic or horseradish. the 1925 geneva protocol  bans the use of chemical   biological weapons in war but 106 years later someone thought it was ok to transport this through ohio. you have to wonder why after 106 years the united states still has this chemical warfare agent and what military base or munitions storage dump this was stored or has been stored in for so many years. old as this stuff was it should have never been transported by rail interesting that these cars were not even labeled with the proper hazardous materials sign but i doubt that the federal government was going to label these cars with the sign  mustard gas  poison toxic.
crazy how out of a train with 150 cars the only ones with the most toxic load had the hot box brakes on fire.    this is so beyond obvious.
dear patriot nurse i have a gut feeling something far worse is coming our way and i mean bad. they can only kill our flesh and if they kill us now  that means i get to go home early . thank you for what you do. give your life to christ  and you won t fear anymore . he will give you rest. please do it asap bc time is so short.
i have a good friend who drives toxic materials in trucks.  he had to take a variety of classes in order to both drive and off-load these materials.  he has done this for many years  so he knows what he s talking about.  he used to work in the phoenix area and when he was handling these materials  even in the middle of the summer when it was 110 degrees outside  he had to wear a full bio-suit for his protection.  he basically said all these people are unfortunately going to get cancer.
it s hard to imagine these chemicals working their way down the ohio river  then merging with the mississippi river    finally emptying out into the gulf of mexico. there is so much potential damage   destruction staring at us right in the face. just what everyone needed at time when it seems like everything else is  going to hell in a hand basket .
in the years i spent as a volunteer firefighter and received a lot of training in dealing with hazmat incidents  i have never seen a situation where just burning it off was an acceptable means of decontamination and isolating this kind of hazard. granted  this was a situation probably never before encountered   but i ve never heard of the way this was handled or the severe lack of information given to the population to escape this.
this was planned and done on purpose!  but yes a vacation  or just plain packing up and leaving! hopefully some have family out of the area. praying for all affected
so the same entities who told us the experimental cocktail was   safe and effective  are now telling the residents of the ohio area that all is well. imagine that. thank you pn for all you do.
my triplets and i lived through the aftermath of the bp oil spill. oil blobs and beads washing up on our white sand beaches  and the governmental agency that took over clean up basically buried the oil beneath the sand. it was local volunteers who took it upon themselves to do clean up. it was a huge bureaucratic mess with longterm after effects for years after the spill. dead zones in the gulf of mexico as well as impacts to local fishermen  as well as commercial fishermen . the air smelled of strange petroleum like odors that burned the eyes   respiratory system  similar to when we have a red tide except much worse burning sensation . it s been almost exactly 13 years since the bp disaster. ask anyone along the gulf coast of louisiana to the big bend area of florida who went through it  and they will tell you basically the same things. the government played the aftermath along the coast beaches etc down and it was locals in each area helping each other with clean up.
we do a lot more poisoning than we do heating!
the climate change was agreed in rio in 1992
like f j b. did nordstream
read a very short article stating that climate protesters could of been a cause of sabotage on this train
how do u boil chemicals   do these a-holes at the epa have any clues
give it a a few weeks and the run-off will be in the gulf everything flows into the mississippi and into the gulf we are f -ked
maybe he should go back alone off the clock and test the water himself.
@teenapittman4241  just what i was thinking.
me too  test and expose
thank you for the update. i was hoping for better news for cincy  but i must admit  not very optimistic
wow  just wow.
wow be careful!
@teenapittman4241  agree! hope they do run tests themselves
per the  chemist  in this house  dilution is the solution  . test the water again after a heavy rain  which it did rain shortly after  and see if the chemicals have been diluted. keep testing.
wow
@teenapittman4241  and expose himself to being ruined  or disappeared for trying to bring the truth to light.
fed hazmat should have been on scene immediately. professionals never brought in. left to politicians decisions! epa same. no accountability. railway moving highly toxic chemicals thru small towns.  even hospitals have msds books in each dept for all chemicals used. how to clean up. knowing that these chemicals were that volatile to temp should have used something that freezes. dry ice type idea. not chemist  but bring the freeze zone over spill vs blowing up.
@johnfranktullo3463 nope   just lipstick
exactly!
@mikekemper9566  coincidences   i study synchronistic mathematics.truth is hidden in other dimensions and can be intuited if a person has a level of cognitive development.  unfortunately  individuation occurs in about .0001  of the population---- so enigma is extremely complex for the average human mind.  coincidences are extremely detailed  and context is very difficult to paste together in a short amount of time.
exactly! we are being manipulated and managed for selfish reasons by individuals who do not care about us.
@occamsrazor7939   narcissism is the real pandemic. cc.        hierarchy is pathological  yet so many want to climb the ladder.
well said
it happened in a flyover state.  if it happened in a poor black neighborhood  they would be screaming racism.
pure evil !
@janedoh8251  man made term  only god can change climate!
taxation and control. ironically  that area is a  test  area for digital id smart watches to monitor health of the wearer. not to mention they filmed a movie using townsfolk as extras about a train accident disaster. they got the watches on the guinea pigs before unleashing the fury.
and  control
they don t care about climate...
climate change only when it is related to emergency that they cannot control. they can t turn of your gas car with a push of a button climate issues like oil spills they will rage about. it all makes actual complete sense.
have you heard of lac megantic s story the downtown was destroyed by maine s train company mma.they were sued. the down is getting back to its feet almost a decade later.
amazing huh
truth.
it s not the frist time they ve reacted this way
boom! nailed it
@andrewslagle1974  i know that they decided at the summit in rio
and control of us. don t forget that because that is their endgame.
planned   no other way to say it
@gypsygirl2972  good point!  i heard it is a conservative area that voted in high numbers for trump.
@johnfranktullo3463    maybe. i know the cameras caught it throwing sparks way before it derailed
@andrewslagle1974  well  not 100  true. nuke testing moves the earth- however slight. edit- ps  all these tree huggers suing the logging industries out of buisness   not that they all were logging responsibly  but good foresting management would have done well to provide ability to intercept some of those wildfires.
indeed!
i suspect they created this disaster
exactly.
@carefulcarpenter narcissist predominately are those in charge now!
crickets never sounded louder than the response to this fiasco going on in ohio now.
i know!  where are the eco warriors   the  gores and grettas
oh  my question is since this guy has the ability to test the water himself why didn t he go back and get samples from the same place as he just went on his own and then come back and test them to get the results himself
@sledninja  my question is why didn t he conduct the test as usual and did he get validation of her department and title   i mean   wow.  these days we are in requires credentials and checks.  he should have said   fine but i need to get part of the samples in my own vials and you should have told me because it s my work and my samples.
thank you for this information. believe me. i too have seen this firsthand. i am 60 miles south of east palestine along the ohio river. i grew up in a small town. i have taken pictures of all of this two days i visited the river. water treatment people saying our drinking water is safe and they treated it. just a small amount of butyl acrylate. are they ever going to also say to us and oh by the way dioxins  vinyl chloride present. nope. truth. blessings friend
@deniseneu7806  rain   is going to do much more than dilute.
thank youi m in newark ohiocincinnati ohio is way south but yep we are in big troubleonly god can save us

@mdk1968  i m subscribing to your channel and marty s we may not have it all together but together we gat it all! let s all look out for each other   love one another as i have loved you
@lauriecollins7312  that s what i don t understand  the contingency plan should have been acted on immediately  it sounds like they had no contingency  therefore they should not have shipped it.
the climate always tends to change  about four times a year.
@formermpsgt  i ve been labeled one.  control by manipulation  chaos  devaluing  deceit  etc.i am not an authority on this though i listen to professionals and i observe.
only christ can end this evil.
@lifelifemoreabundantly  people who are not believers in christianity would wonder why you seevevil.  can you explain that--- what percentage of evil are you suggesting he end
you got it... it s all about money and how much they can put in their pockets.
@newnew-jk2kh  it is all about money  and how much debt the people will accept.
@libertykim6438  debt is causing us the greatest problems--- plus   trickle-down economics  was actually  trickle-up .  people became compliant to the mandates in their lives  without thinking for themselves. truth is context-driven  deceit is agenda-driven. those not interested in accurate information are not interested in truth.              cc 2020
@johnfranktullo3463  distillation process using correct equipment.
that s why we all need to quit funding this idiocy!!!! starve out the beast and live free in peace!

yea so what the heck. pick and choose what they want to get involved in
you mean bread and circuses - all the clowns are in dc.
exactly  they have shown their true colors to the world. and what s going to come of their nefarious acts  they have broken the everlasting covenant with the earth.
@needgrants ...earth and god...
@carefulcarpenter  if we didn t have tyrants then we wouldn t have debt. we need to have justice against the tyranny.
well said keith!
and oh yeah also dirigibles... but especially x2 think and speak...
@carefulcarpenter  you do know that i agree with you. it s a shame you can t show me the same respect. please don t be arrogant.
@libertykim6438  your comment seems to be a judgement
@carefulcarpenter  do you always like your own comments
@libertykim6438  are you familiar with the way notifications are sent
@carefulcarpenter  stop trolling me. if i wanted to be bothered i d talk to a liberal.
amen!!!   amen!amen!!!   amen!amen!!!   amen!amen!!!   amen!amen!!!   amen!amen!!!   amen!amen!!!   amen!amen!!!   amen!amen!!!   amen!
@carefulcarpenter  but   is there  such a thing as  coincidence
@carefulcarpenter  exactly!
that s right
the democrats never let a good crisis go to waist!
@mrbillmechanic  i thought  maybe we would have a discussion
@carefulcarpenter  righton.   cognitive    dissonance  is  a  powerful impediment  to  investigation of one s own  religious  cultural and  all other  biases.
@mrbillmechanic  some things are so contradictory to the simple wisdoms that we were taught by those who lived in worlds past. difficult for people to see anything in the present moment--- right in front of our faces. we overestimate our intelligence  we see things on the landscape from the lens of past giants. we become fearful in the moment whereby  we get in line without challenging our established indoctrination.
@mrbillmechanic  yes  inconsistency  hypocrisy  though  i refer to coincidences that have consistent and also emergent meaning. truth is revealed through time. cognitive dissonane is contradictory over time  not developing a gestault perspective of the complexities of life--- but leaning towards a narrow  simplistic view  and changing with the winds.synchronicity is very conststent over time  and accumulates as it gains complexity.  faith alone may appear to be a solid perspective  though it is experience which establishes a rudder in our lives.  faith with works  as james said in the bible  faith without works is dead.synchronistic mathematics is emergent  fundamental  increasingly meaningful over time  and inspires gainful enthusiasm.
yup
depopulation agenda part
keith  well of course   they are hypocrites.
@johnfranktullo3463  many  but not most  actually do have clues  but almost all do not have priorities !
@bossdog1480  you re talking about 10 s of millions of gallons
you cannot milk cash out of a problem you can actually solve.
spot on !!
the same companies own the media that owns the train company.
every.single.time.
also the main part is power over we the people!!!
it s much bigger than money and politics.
@johnfranktullo3463  thank you.  you are spot on
right on point.
and the nord stream pipe line
100  intentional.
it is actually evil.
they caused it. we all got their number.
@andrewslagle1974  amen  brother!
@badapple65  speaking of taxes  why the hell are we still paying them
@hastycontemplation  most likely laughing it up with obiden
@carefulcarpenter  why are we all still paying taxes
i have been stocking up on water before it hits the mississippi river
i urge everyone who hasn t read  the book animal farm by george orwell .
it s all about who controls what.
i wonder how far away is far enough. how far can this travel in the skies and then rains comes  down.  i imagine it can travel 100 s and 100 s of miles
@paultaylor7570  the ohio river is the biggest contributor to the mississippi river. let that sink in. absolutely no pun intended.
but what s gonna happen wen these chemicals flow their way down the rivers
@suepooh3822  the answer is obvious. the land and water supply becomes contaminated  unsustainable  and uninhabitable for years if not decades or permanently.
@vince6792  that s what i m thinking..i m wondering how long we hav til our waters not fit ...i tell people to go buy bottled water but they seem like it s a joke
@suepooh3822  without clean water absolutely nothing can live  grow  or survive. water becomes a very expensive finite commodity. desalinization plants become our only alternative. this is a major problem. few people take things serious until it affects them.
we have friends 16 miles west of east palestine. i wonder how long it will be until their water is toxic.
@danielleyoder4247  given the severity and aerial coverage of the event along with the milage you mentioned...even if the natural water flow was pitched in the opposite direction...not long. the epa should provide information  but given it s another untrustworthy government agency  i wouldn t rely on them.
william mount says it s phosgene gas  military weapon.  it is all very bad for everyone whatever it is.  lots will be affected.  this is a very important video.  in going to try to get it around.  love n prayers pn.
prayers for you!!! what has befallen you is atrocious in every way!
get out! save yourself and family. whatever it takes
thanks guys i am definitely trying to plan my way out in the near future. we don t feel safe and it seems like everyone is sick
@meredithmclaughlin4902  i have an off the grid primitive cabin in virginia that i m not using if that would help.
praying for all you guys!! be safe   get out!  they are lying to you!
@paulhare662 what a wonderful and beautiful generous offer you displayed. may yahweh bless you for it.
my friends cats first adopted family s brother is an astronaut. he said the same thing.
it s raining in e palestine now
move west of the mississippi.
thank you sir for your service.
thank you for your service. god bless you.
thank you!!
thank you for your service! my dad also has agent orange  he s had 5 heart attacks. 6 stents  he has skin problems  mental health problems  and some crazy other problems! as his daughter i also have problems from the effects on him. i agree with you! i would leave too! but that town isn t a rich area. how do they just leave  where do they go  how do they have money  if they quit their jobs  abandon their houses  cause they can t sell them  i m sure most of that town lives paycheck to paycheck. it sounds simple and i ve said the same thing i would leave! i d sleep in my car if i had to! but if i had no job and no income i wouldn t be able to feed my kids or even put gas in the car. the govt needs to re home these people! give them money to evacuate. we can give trillions to ukraine but can t help a small town in the us ! this entire govt needs to go!!! we elect them  they work for us  yet they use us as pawns that are expendable! if they start a war to get what they want they don t care if we are killed by bombs. the only war  we the people  should ever fight is a war against our govt! it s crazy to me. we truly would be better off without a government!!!
keto man i salute you for your service these people from the government want to destroy us and make us serfs and peasants we must put our trust with god may the lord bless you amen.
there is no yucca mountain  that plan got shut down  sure the facility is there but the nuclear waste was never brought in
the  agent orange  of my day so far is about any water you drink and the burn pits
thank you  good sir for your service
i saw a video by one of the small channel you tube contributors showing epa test meters covered with baggies. hmm...
i cry very often.  our situation seems so hopeless.  the beast system is taking over.
it s the results of our nation turning its back on god.  blessings are being removed.  we should ve been crying for every baby getting murdered in our country over the past 30 years  crickets and very few tears for the innocents.
thank you for your service
hi  thank you for your service. i m sorry you re suffering now. this country has been slowly eroding before our eye for decades. actually  more than that. if you re here  you know. the most important message i took away from pn today  faith in god  love  not fear    discernment are our most powerful allies. wishing you peace in these days.
people   it s not the time to cry.   it s time to fight  plan and prepare
you are not alone with that mindset
@silver-en7kl  absolutely
right ther with you.
@christinepound5889  semper fidelis there will be a time to fight
were all in horrible danger wen it reaches the mississippi river...millions will die wen it gets in our water
@usmcretired2112  i pray god gives you the highest in blessings! you certainly have earned it! i believe with all my spirit the lord must remove us very soon so he can end all evil. that means the child u lost u will b with soon as long as you ve trusted jesus with your soul...hallelujah!
they re trying to do this everywhere! i saw a video of where they brought in explosive loaded boxcars and parked them near ranches in california  but they did not think people would notice!
@cher93  link of video please !
@ keto man - thank you for taking time to give this excellent advice to the people of east palestine.  the longer they stay  the more severe the health issues they face will be.  as more and more information comes out regarding what the serious long-term effects will be  even people living within hundreds of miles downstream will realize their health is also in danger.  i d immediately set up an account with the organization   give send go    not  go fund me    borrow or accept gifts from family and friends in other states  cash in whatever you can to make the move  but  get out of dodge  - asap!
amen!
maybe eventually  the rest of the  us  will see the same.
thank you for your service. i m sorry the guberment treated nam vets like trash. you are true heroes in my book. i m also sorry the guberment messed up your health. god bless you.
no mistake 100  intentional.
god bless you sir!
@tyrantexterminator1776  completely my thought from the beginning.
very good advice. thank you for taking the time to share.
@ontarget7582  semer fi
same here we are done
same here  i pray and weep almost everyday. my ancestors worked very hard to help make this country a safe haven for legal immigrants since before the beginning. they wouldn t recognize the place.
again thank you for your service   i have found myself doing the same. as a child of a korean veteran   my dad is gone. however i know dad is crying too. i find myself tearing more and praying harder. i am a fighter i ll be damned i will not give up.
hold the line.
like you i swore an oath  it is hard to watch the country you swore an oath to turn into a different country... one that no longer deserves the oath and the subsequent sacrifices that many people made under that oath....
@musabe009 thank you for your service.
may god comfort you and thank you so much for your service.
so when do we stop crying and actually take action to rid our nation of this type of disgusting elitism
@musabe009  i m with you. my now deceased twin brother gave 26 years to our usaf  reaching the very top level of nco before he reached retirement. he was in vietnam and first gulf war. he s been gone 17 years now. my heart grieves sooo deeply. he would be shocked to see the military branch today that he gave sooo much to. and he would be shocked and disgusted to see what our nation has become!!and  our ancestors before us!!may god have mercy on those of us who  still love and revere him and his holy word.  god bless and keep you safe!!
musabe009 i understand. come from a family of fighters!! the veterans of america- without them we wouldn t be here! we all must fight for our freedom!! semper fi
it is time to fight back
i m so sorry buddy. we weep with you. america is under judgment for its many sins. america is referred to as mystery babylon in the bible  in jeremiah. it says of mystery babylon  that it will be invaded by foreigners and destroyed! so our only hope is in jesus. if you haven t been saved  please put your faith in jesus. confess your sins and be sorry for them  we all sin . ask jesus to forgive all your sins and come into your life and save you. then get baptized in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins. then you can have a relationship with god  hear from him  be comforted by him. you can go to heaven one day. he s the only way. and if you ve taken the covid shot  confess that sin too  of not trusting god to keep you safe   repent and ask him to heal you and forgive you. thank you so much for your service  god richly bless you sir.
your not alone my friend..we weep with you
@christinepound5889  cling to jesus and focus on him  not the storm
@ontarget7582  there s a time for everything under the sun  a time to mourn  and a time to reflect. a time to realize things  a time to prepare. a time for peace  a time to fight.
@kathleenpimentel9218  what line
@johnletourneau6176  the line. now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.
@williammcelroy3898  what do you think will happen to the people that took the walk
am so sorry   i know it s hard to see all this happen . to think what a disgrace after all you worked for   our country   our freedoms  your government is now trying to destroy. the innocent people  children   animals who have to suffer. my heart has felted very heavy also
you are not alone. what i wouldn t for a mean tweet or two right now.
we weep with you.
@christinepound5889  it is not hopeless  i know it seems like it is  but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.i read the end of the book and we win . don t let the enemy still your joy for the joy of the lord is our strength.
thank you for your service  i weep for my country as well.
@williammcelroy3898    thank you
@williammcelroy3898  even jesus had sorrow and cried for a little while   he was human such as we are but there was glory and triumph in the end.
toughen up buttercup! jeez man....
musabe009   it s the bad news that makes the good news good  late pastor adrian rogers
i m disabled and a veteran because if chemical exposure  denied by the va.anyway i m 63 miles away. today my nose started bleeding   idk. so sad
my husband and father are and were both army veterans and it s been plain to see that our government absolutely hates us and wants us dead. evil is ruining this planet and no one is stopping them. i feel sorry and very angry for my very little grandchildren.
@michaelhunter3101  so what s the plan of action you propose  i think the evil in this world out weighs by far the good. our only hope is to keep connected to our savior our father in heaven.
@thefrogking481  rude.
same.  i have been truely saddened as of late
hang in there brother. god is still in control and it s just a matter of time before he intervenes once and for all.
@themallyjoe  absolutely i didn t mean to be hard hearted my heart breaks and i cry as well as give joy for the blessing of life.
@michaelhunter3101  it seems like more are turning to our side. i think the breakout of the revival at asbury kentucky is significant. i think people are getting ready spiritually  for exactly what you said. we want our values  integrity and country back.
@belleofamherst  amen sister.
@kat4256  and our saviour jesus christ will come from the heavens in the eastern sky like a lightening bolt and a warrior.  he isn t coming as a lamb this time around.  i like how you worded it!!
@williammcelroy3898  what do you mean
i m not disabled  but also a 20 year veteran  and i totally resemble your comment!!  i am so broken-hearted for our country!! .     and thank you for your service as well musabe009!!    god bless you!!
thank you for your service!  you can cry and weep. but make no mistake we the people are ready to fkn roll.  just say when !!
i wasn t really implying that to what you said i was just saying it s okay to cry and feel sorrow .
it will get better sir  just not in our lifetime. please stay strong buddy
we unite in prayer for our country and prayer is our strongest sword       . to all of our heroes here and beyond  we thank you and your family for the sacrifices and services. america is worthy of saving.  call this to the name of the lord
@ontarget7582  it s time to repent for ourselves and our nation and put our trust in god. he s the only one who can help us. listen and obey his voice. he promised to take care of his own so if you aren t  his child then  recieve him into your heart jesus paid the price for you so you could become his family.
thank you for your service.   never give up!  i know this is dire but miracles happy.
@thefrogking481  having the intelligence to realize just what a humungous   devastating  and horrendous disaster this spill and burn is  is not something to be made fun of. apparently you cannot understand how big this is- be kind!! there is a time to be tough  but we must take time to wrap our minds around how huge this new variable  possibly a huge amount of the middle of our countryside water  is toxic   needs to be grasped!!!!
abortion has been legal for roughly 50 years in the usa
@darrellmortensen9805  yes it has look how many lives never had a chance to live and make a difference in this world. just because it is legal certainly doesn t make it excusible or right.god judges and  god forgives but we need to repent and stop doing what he hates.
@silver-en7kl  the hebrews did the same thing. they became subjects of king nebuchadnezzar the hard way. the canaanites had 450 years to get their act together. they refused and the hebrews took over when they came out of egypt. history repeats itself  and we will be no exception. repentance is needed.
thank you for your service to our country.  god bless
sir ---i am sorry for what you had to see...when i look at my kids and grandkids i try not to think of the future
2 chronicles 7 14 is god s message to christians in this disintegrating country.something can be done! christians read and implement!
@christinepound5889  god will end it
my parents imigrated here from lithuania and became farmers. they past away 50 years ago. they came here to live in a free country but i believe they would be shocked and saddened to see what is happening.
stay strong brother  this country will need us veterans very soon   disabled or not bro   you are doing it   keep speaking truth and theres tons we can do
i m also a disabled vet - can t believe that our own troops will obey orders against americans - we are in a world of   !
and its going to get worse...
i worked with a young woman who had come here as a refugee from afghanistan. she had a 2 year old and was pregnant at the time. she told me how she had to escape on her own with her daughter  her husband i believe was already here. she came with only what she could carry. she told me she loved america  and that it was better here  and people were kind to her  that they offered to help when they saw her in the store struggling. she told me the united states was better than her homeland and that she loved being here. it s not lost yet  there are still a lot of good people out there. love one another.
you re not alone brother.
sir at this point many people are weeping  and its not just for ohio  its all the things that are wrong.
it s been prophesied to happen for 2 000 years. incredibly sad to see it finally taking shape. i envy people who were able to live in more normal  far less evil times. but don t worry--evil s time will be very short. get right with god and he will save you! there is nothing to fear then.
@christinepound5889  the devil wants people to feel hopeless.  that s despair.  opposite of faith in god.
@questionasker1749  amen!
me everyday i wake up to see this world crumble further and further. but just keep faith and endure till the end brother.
it makes me weep too.  i long for god s judgement on the evil.
i feel the same!
thank you for serving.
thank you for your service and may god bless you and keep you. you are not alone  i cry out to god to have mercy on us and to save us and our country from destruction. keep the faith my friend and keep praying
@debihester7284  amen
@williammcelroy3898  amen
@christinepound5889  don t lose hope the beast system is destined to fall. each of us must stand strong with the armor of god. the victory is in his hands.
@deborahshoop563    i know that. but it hurts me badly to see people suffering. i am an empath and i can feel the suffering as if it was my own.
@christinepound5889  i understand. your prayers and acts of kindness towards those suffering are extremely important in these times. god bless you.
@deborahshoop563    thank you for that god bless you too
@superscrowder    except they have poisoned all the rain water and they are working on poisoning all water on earth.
thank you so much sir for your years in the military!god bless you!
@ontarget7582  and pray as patriotnurse reminded us
one kingdom must fall for god s kingdom to come! he will wipe away all our tears! keep the faith!! we are to walk by faith and not by sight!!
netflix has a movie  white noise  that detailed this very thing.
georgia guide stones
when do we begin to fight back
thank god someone can see the truth! it s high time people make sure you ve given your life to christ! we r at the end folks! it s biblical
@amysue1616  i m starting to wonder the same thing...and honestly i don t see people batting an eye
@4eagles962  absolutely!  chemical warfare deployment from inside! god bless!
@lillylynn3370  glad to know there are still people out there in whom haven t forgotten.
yes i pray dear god help and protect these poor people  in jesus name!
there needs to be a class action suit against the rail company and the federal gov. both for incompetence  lack of empathy  and the burning only to get rails back up and running as soon as possible. time is money but lives mean nothing !  obviously not until it hits your bottom end  and a suit places them in 11 u.s.c.   101 chapter 7 bankruptcy.
amen
strangers caring for strangers. isaiah 58. cover someone else s nakedness as though it were their own.
get your important papers etc. pets and some pictures etc. the live stock set free and hopefully someone will find them or they can live off land. that s all you can do.
@amysue1616  right!!  americans will complain talk and comment. but many americans still are not going to stand up.
@josephtobin3347  i was just going to say this! evil doers! i pray for everyone affected
it has happened again and again and again. this was no accident. it was deliberate. be safe my friends.
we are not given a spirit of fear but of power  love and a sound mind!! pray over everything! god s mighty hand does not slack!
definitely deliberate. sadly.
i think she will be there friday  or one day before long.
this is strange   me and my daughter  12  just watched erin brocovich a few weeks ago   it ended up being just a couple days before the giant chemical spill in ohio. when my daughter heard the news she said well they should call erin ! ha ha i said sweetie she probably is already on it ! very interesting how the universe  god   the world can speak to you if you are open to listening.
@flagbabygirl  erin has been contacted.  check her video on yt.................
@ice cream holding fee  erin brockovich was interviewed a couple of days ago and she is highly concerned and looking into this as well.
erin has been in east palestine and i believe she is planning on coming back later this week. i live there and i don t feel safe and now i have to find somewhere to go because my hometown is ruined
yikes!
thank you for your service. i m at the point where i hate our guberment and wish no one would serve. they care nothing for us americans.
at the very least  the mustard gas compound would cause vomiting and diarrhea from casual contact.
fun fact  from the old mustard gas recipe we get a modern chemo drug bendamustine.
yes  it was planned.  how can so many zombies not see this
@travelinggirl6681  these are the same people that believed when they were told  safe and effective
@isaac357mag  bingo.
@travelinggirl6681  the bible has an answer to your question   because they received not the love of the truth  that they might be saved. and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion  that they should believe a lie  that they all might be damned who believed not the truth  but had pleasure in unrighteousness   2 thessalonians 2 10-12 . moral of the story... always love the truth.
yep
exactly!! sabotage on all fronts!! stay prayed  up
@travelinggirl6681   yes.  who will be affected...    2 in egg production.  cheese production. the amish.  more crop losses.  or  if they plant  the food will be toxic  eggs will be toxic.   all by design.
my instantaneous thoughts- exactly. another catastrophe for greed. sad
if it is obvious  what is the motive
@godscommandmentsaretruthis2837  amen!
@godscommandmentsaretruthis2837  i have seen many verses speaking about how we are to know truth.  thank you for your comment  it brings me comfort and encouragement to keep going the way that i feel i am being led.
no kidding. from what i heard  there were weapons grade chemicals on that train.
i agree
not only that but it s highly sus that the cdc changed the toxicology report for polyvinyl chloride just 11 days before trainwreck taking out the harm to children completely and minimizing the cancerous effects. they also took out the safe particles per ml vs toxic calculation completely.
maybe we should open all of our borders. thanks joey bribes.
b0mb train.
it s not.almost 1800 traincars derail every year.that s almost 5 per day. only a simple minded dolt would look for a  reason .it happens all the time.
curious how it happened.  that car  that place  was someone there   and ran off
@thefrogking481  where is the source material and who compiled the data
@isaac357mag  and still wear masks in the middle of a lake on a fishing boat. yes  i ve seen that.
looked like a ball of burning termite with an h to me. same stuff as sparklers for july 4th.
@thefrogking481  why
the movie white noise says it all
and guess who they blamed for removing regulations
check the tracks along the rout for thermite.
exactly
@chrisbroussard4951  control of the people
this was a chemical warfare deployment disaster. not an accident!  god bless !
we can t keep running from this evil and their deeds. my instinct tells me we must fight back physically. no one is coming to save us.
@grannyarbuckle5554  i won t discount prayer but sometimes god calls on his people to act. is only praying an act of those who do not have the courage to fight against evil  we would not have these united states if a small amount of colonists weren t willing to physically fight. at this point continuing to wait for god to save you is fruitless. pray for strength to overcome our enemies. that s what god is telling me at this point.
agreed and wicked plans
@gregbreitz972   control of people  they set off a massive poisonous explosion in a poor rural town. the government officials are acting like it s not that big of a deal  marginalizing the damage. what control are you talking about  what exactly is obvious
@chrisbroussard4951  genocide
see tore says podcast or video.  they were covering up something that was on the train that they didn t want to get caught with.
@jaymontgomery3330   genocide is killing people. it is not controlling them.  perhaps it s terrorism.
@mgcchannel1  your comment just prompted me to look into the wiki page for vc. the edits to  storage and transportation   liver failure   health effects   burning   environmental polluting have been a frenzy of changes since it happened. some people are running cover to cover up information to any unsuspecting individuals to get miss information because that site sadly sees a lot of traffic and really is not a go to source for research. you cannot site anything on a research paper from there so you shouldn t trust your health to it either.
it was a broken axel not bad breaks. the axel broke because the tracks needed to be replaced.
@mgcchannel1  again    you ve got to me kidding!  when will this be stopped
@greeneyes6311   of course  that makes perfect sense. i will start calling all dead people  controlled  instead. the internet is making me smarter.
@thefrogking481  derailments happen all the time but authorities don t set fire to toxic contents sending them further away than they ever could. deliberate mismanagement. how else can they test their digital health tracker which were launched 4 months back in surprise surprise east palestine  voluntarily
it wasn t the brakes it was the axl
some getting even for gas line maybe
pure evil.
the safe and effective was a test for these things coming
@dctoontime  i agree wit you 100 !!
@nancykoernke1514  yea..sure it was
agreed
yes look to the heavenly kingdom
yes
amen!! jesus is our only hope
he is the way the truth and the life and no one will come to the father except through himamen.
@godisgoodmelrod9232  amen
thank you for telling the truth  i know that it is very difficult to bust someone s bubble of a illusion of being safe.... the information you were given is correct. most of the people with high amounts of exposure to these chemicals will be dead from cancer in twenty years  the few that are left will all have cancer and die not too much longer after that. i think  one part per million of molecules is the acceptable amount exposure  but even that small amount of exposure will build up over time. i have no solution  except get as far away from there as possible.i m very sorry  but i just wanted to confirm what you are saying  people should be told the truth. god bless youthank you for telling the truth  i love you very much for doing that
sad.
@donald thank you for your comment. my son is currently working in wheeling west virginia as of yesterday. i think it s an hour and a half away. i told him to buy water. any other advice  he actually lives in west tennessee and we are in arkansas and i believe all of our water will be affected. any thoughts or suggestions
@ donald also just wondering about him breathing the air and bathing in that water  i don t see how any of it can be good. he just started this job working in the oil field about a month ago and he s hitch started back yesterday for two weeks.
we have never had so many evil demons in charge  before. they don t care and they are not going to start caring. this is a battle of good versus evil.
i totally agree.  it was bad enough the spill  but then to set it on fire.....bad idea.  frankly  i believe that made the matter even worse.  god bless the people in and around e. palistine.  i feel aweful for everyone.
@pamelar4782   yeah  they burnt the evidence.
you know it
understand that priority  1 was to get the tracks opened asap for train traffic. profits over safety of the citizens of ohio  pennsylvania and beyond. tragic and completely immoral
go bless you patriot nurse! i live about thirty miles to the west of east palestine. god help us.
all part of the plan....
i agree i am retired fireman and hazmat specialist.  i have never seen any thing like this.  you may have seen in training a rail accident near where i live.  livingston train derailment.  look it up on youtube it is there. it was used in training on how not to do things.  some of the details are similar and they ended up blowing up a few of them and burning them off.
absolutely nothing was learned from time beach
pack up n show up at joey s house
troy walker- so many of those people are farmers homesteaders. you don t just walk away and abandon your livestock.
@kathytincler1852  and they don t have to.  i know what you re saying. and if it happened in my area  i may just go down with my ship also. but  the meat from any animal is going to be affected. it pretty much comes down to a life or death decision. sadly
good point
oh! boy! authoritarianism will surely makes us happy  as long as we have nothing. nothing to worry about--- we have modern science to save us. cc.      2023
i didn t comply with the mandates.
crazy that people believe them!  cognitive dissonance at a higher level i guess.
@nobody-eh5qw  none of it made sense to me. sadly it is impossible to be heard by people in panic mode.
@nobody-eh5qw  what were your feelings or information source that made you relucant
bingo
@neosharkey  sounds like you are catching on to how they operate
there is power in unity. stay safe.
we are on our own except for the grace and love of god. our government is evil.
a hazmat firefighter on the scene said that to clear the problem more quickly  those in charge purposely set the train cars fire   he said he was flabbergasted at the idiocy.  many lawsuits must happen  as people in the area will be affected for years because of this ..
i live in cincinnati. around 300 or so miles away. our cincinnati water works is telling us  trace  amounts reached the ohio river from a  small  creek  they say their scientists were quickly at work when this happened and that our water is safe. we haven t used the water for drinking and my pets have stores of water of their own  however  showering is unavoidable. fyi  i m a nurse and my patients are all getting tao water  so god help them. i have no choice but to stay and hope for the best. we had storm and rain right after the event  so i m sure the toxins released into the air dumped on us as others.  thanks for discussing this on your channel. long time subscriber here! peace   love. jesus is coming soon!
this is our modern day love canal. this town is essentally chemically contaminated  probably forever. as an osha inspector  we test during an 8 hour  time period  the people that are staying are being exposed at some level  24 7. if you can smell it  you are exposed to it. just say it pn  if you are able to leave  leave  and make no excuses for it. this could potentially have long lasting health effects that may not show up for years. you and your community are essentially on your own.
extremely heartbreaking . even bathing in it is extremely toxic.our skin is the biggest organ in our bodies....it will absorb all that toxicity. i m heartbroken for all these people.
i m a trucker and i went thru there 3 times and my lungs are so screwed up.  when i breathe it sounds like the death rattle. i m going to get an x-ray tomorrow to see what is going on.  it is scary.  i just can t imagine what s happening to the people and animals that live there.  prayers for all
thank you pn  i m from ohio and this story needs all the coverage it can get! i really appreciate it  it s very kind of you.
this reminds me of the trumpet blast in revelation with wormwood and the waters become bitter and people die because they can t drink it - so many foreshadowing events worldwide are occurring
well spoken as usual. this is def huge. glen beck is sending and paying for an independent ongoing soil  water  air testing company  of his choosing  to go there to help these poor  innocent ppl. erin brockovich is going there. if u don t know who she is  look her up. she s a force our govt doesn t want involved for sure!!!
with the fact there were two other railroad issues in arizona and miichigan i m thinking this is part of something much larger.
as a retired fireman and hazmat specialist  i knew that this was really bad.  i have worked with some of those chemicals on scenes. i think they have made a bad problem even worse.  then throw the long term on top of that it will alter the future of the town.  the government is never the answer for this kind of stuff.  they rushed to open the rails backup way to fast.  i look at the money and everything starts to make more sense.  greed drives this old world.  please stay safe everyone and i hope those people are able to get a way from that area.
i am not a hydrologist  but i am a geoscientist who took a hydrology class in college. it is my understanding that inorganic material cannot be cleaned from the water table and will stay in there forever. i don t understand the comparisons to the bp oil spill. the contamination from the bp oil spill was much more diffused and the dangerous chemicals were much less concentrated. most of the bp oil spill was oil which is not nearly as bad as the ohio chemicals. i don t think the world has ever seen a disaster as big as this. the town has become a superfund site without any superfund.
best advice i ve heard. sad  really. those people are walking dead. length of exposure is an issue  as well. i would have never returned regardless of cost or impact. i could never bring a child back into that. decades of health problems and premature death for these folks. your message on point  i am grieving for these people and what lies ahead for them.
thank you as always! once i was able to look at this... there is one main reason they are trying to act like its no big deal. there has been nearly no epa ntsb fema involvement. what little there is... is token presence at best. they are purposely avoiding real data collection and documentation because if there arent records.. than its not a big deal right  here is the thing. thats still not the main reason so little action has been done. what they are deathly afraid of is when we realize the most important and damning thing! why were these chemicals that are incredibly hazardous... being transported in this manner in the first place! these compounds are super super dangerous... even exposure to 15 ppm over 15min is hazardous in a workplace for breathing. what this shows is that oversight and regulations over corporations has become so bad that they are allowing toxins that have even been used to make gases for chemical warfare are being shipped around with no special precautions. thats what they are hiding... total and complete lack of oversight! ml and many blessings all!
prayers to all the individuals going through this terrible incident.   pn thank you for all you do.
there is a major aquifer under ohio that provides water to all of ohio. there is a good chance it s been affected along with any other water source that taps into it. even living in oh i didn t hear about the derailment until about 7 days after it happened.
how can we help  how do we donate to help them in ohio even if i can donate money  i d love to help. thanks for warning the rest of us about the toxic effects people can have and will have with these conditions.prayers for those who are suffering and the surrounding animals. p.s. thank you for your beautiful testimony and your reminder to listen to the spirit and body god gave us!
let s send  50b to ukraine.  ohio gets  0.  sickening.
i ve worked for ns for the past 19 years and all i can tell you is this  when a railroad bossman or representatives  lips are moving  they are lying to you.
dear patriot nurse  well first off thank you  i absolutely agree  this is not going to end well for many people. i did have a basic understanding of the many chemicals that were talking about  and this is beyond comprehension that they would even try transporting this material where the odds of accidental spills was not at a bare minimum   the containers were borderline breach proof.anyway  my main comment is about you  at one point you had me in tears toward the end of this video. your love  your compassion  your god fearing foundation sets you apart as a sister in christ that is truly being used by our heavenly father.your gifts and talents are used to great benefit to all of us out here  your ability to   through god   to edify us and offer assurance strikes a chord in the heart of hearts of so many. and you are so right in reminding and challenging everyone to listen to their inner voice    the holy spirit    -    that quiet whisper    that lives in each of us  reminding and challenging everyone to draw near and listen is beyond powerful.like a gentle whisper in the wind we must understand the powerful wisdom that carries it along  one of god s precious gifts to us if we will only quiet our spirits and listen.thank you again  stay blessed and be safe in all that you do. danny in texas
i have heard that they want to create areas they seem unsafe or unusable and force ppl into their 15 min cities. definitely believe that could be the cause here or part of the reason they could be doing this.
sources
yes he is
i m so sorry.
prayers
some of us on south west michigan are having breathing difficulties
hope it gets better for you .
@jewelrygrace9438  that has to be from another source as the accident was far to the east from you.
@masterkeep  michigan also had a train wreck a few days ago involving tanker cars but said no chemicals were spilled.
oh shit. i forgot about that one. whoa..
yes!
@masterkeep  he said he drove through there  he didn t say he lived there.
i told my family in pa they all need to have blood scans and x rays done asap so they have the proof they were fine prior to this event. it s obviously not going to be covered by insurance but people need proof of the health decline after the event.
@ann1234  my response was to someone who said they lived in south michigan  not to the driver.  his  unfortunately  is likely really bad.
@jewelrygrace9438  that s worrisome. i m in grand rapids and wondering if it s far enough away here
@masterkeep there saying a 200 mile radius which puts all of lake erie in the contamination zone and detroit
praying for you!
@terryrose6208  there was a car with chemicals
@dave glowa  the problem with that statement is it is 200 miles east to northeast.  the winds wouldn t allow for it to go back that far.
@jesusiskingofall  yes  and it was said that none of it spilled. my daughter lives about 75 ft away from a double set of tracks owned by n and s. i was held up waiting to cross the tracks a few days ago and i counted nearly fifty tanker cars amongst other freight type cars. this is a daily occurrence. there is a small river between her house and the tracks. there was a derailment about three or four years ago just beyond her home but i don t know what type of cargo they were hauling.
i also agree! get x ray asap!
i carry a quality gas mask for that reason  you need to protect yourself   no one else will do it
@terryrose6208  i live here in michigan...there was a derailment  but nothing was leaked.
@masterkeep  what about the water flows
@daveglowa9546  that is away from michigan also.  as she said in the video  it is headed to kentucky and beyond southward.
hope you re going to be ok
sir i really hope your lungs will be okay!!!
praying for you.  trust in jesus my friend.
@daveglowa9546  southern water shed is what i heard.  ohio river to mississippi.

oh my! prayers for your recovery. only god can heal this  exercise your faith in him.
praying for you
@jewelrygrace9438  southwest  not southeast
praying for you
i ll let y all know after tomorrow how i m doing.  i m having an x-ray done and we shall see what damage was done.  thank you all.
god bless.  i wish you a speedy recovery.
1 thessalonians 5 17  pray without ceasing.
you went through there recently
did you smell anything   or just feel it
i m praying for you. i m praying for all of us because we are all under attack by very evil  corrupt forces.
i pray for you. highly carsagenic.
@s l  i could smell it and taste it.  i closed the air vents  but it made no difference .
@never comply  sometimes i think we the peons are nothing but lab rats. i m praying for your health  dear one  and also pray that you trust your soul to our maker  who alone can save us from a certain eternity in hell.watch dr eric berg also  for he s a master of how to get and stay healthy. he s very good....ok.may god be with you! shalom!
document everything
not to get off subject but i live a mile from michigan. so far  there is only one area i can go in michigan that the air doesn t reek from people smoking marijuana  outside at their homes in cities and towns. my dad and stepmom don t smoke it but luve in a small mi town  that constantly reels of weed in the air. the smell seeps into their house. in the last month  my dad started having major breathing problems from it and now has to have quite a few lung tests. that being in the air so often  may be causing a lot of people s breathing and coughing problems in michigan. most of my relatives live in michigan and even just simply driving in their towns  gives me bad asthma attacks.i spent almost 20 hours in michigan  the day after thanksgiving. all i could smell was the marijuana in the air in cities and towns. it was giving me constant asthma  all day. five hours after i arrived home  i woke up in the middle of the night with a severe asthma attack  which quickly became worse. my teen and my husband had to call 911. i m less than 5 mns from the fire station. between the medics and firefighters arriving firefighters are also trained medics   immediately loading me in the ambulance i thought i was dying and lost consciousness. i don t remember much but was told by several people that i nearly died in the back of the ambulance  twice. the er doctor told me several times the medics worked very hard to save my life and went  above and beyond  to save me. several doctors and nurses who have seen my medical file since then have told me emergency situations like this from marijuana have become more frequent for hospitals in general. especially for people with lung problems. i ve had to cut off contact with half of my michigan relatives. they smoke marijuana and i can smell it on their clothes when we re in public. it s awful.
omg  i hope you re ok.
be careful of the medical industry.
what is happening is in my opinion criminal and evil to tell people that it s okay to move back in your home.
don t drive through there anymore. get a different job at a warehouse or something. it s your very life
@nevercomply9258  thnx!
@jewelrygrace9438  so sorry to hear that!
@masterkeep  the wind will carry it. i live in ca where we ve been through several horrific fire events in the last few years and the smoke and chems traveled to vermont and other far flung places.
@kathytincler1852  that is still in the direction of the winds.  for the east palistine train wreck  that was east to northeast.   michigan is west  not the way it went.
prayers for you  keep us posted.
prayers for you
@kathytincler1852  i was just thinking about that earlier. the fires in oregon and california  2 yrs ago    smoke from the 2 big fires drifted really far. people here in mo were having breathing issues and it was even somewhat hazy for a few days.
we just had our third train derailment in the last 6 months here in gothenburg  nebraska.  there have also been derailments in gibbon and north platte.
i m gonna predict this will be usa s chernobyl! make sure you hold me to my words. only god can make this ecological disaster disappear! my heart is heavy.
i m not a biologist  but i m pretty sure chernobyl was bad...
@markymark5281  3mile island
call ohio chernobyl usa...
@1sthawkfeathers547  did anyone die from 3 mile island
thank you
microbial mixtures may help!
a husband wife photographer journalist not long ago snuck into beyon fences on beaches and filmed somebody covering bp oil  spraying desicants from the deep horizon. wife got chemically sick. wish i knew the name.prayers up  and the revival in kentucky i am sure are holding up these people and nature. i appreciate you so much.
oh it s coming to your town soon and mine!
not everyone has the resources or ability to leave home. doing so would cause homelessness. i know it s easy to say  leave  but these poor folks are up a creek without a paddle. you don t understand unless you re currently poor. even getting enough money for gasoline to get out is impossible.
@fancy action now my son just started working in the oil field  drilling  about a month ago and he s 1 1 2 hrs away from there  in wheeling wv. he works 2 wks on and 2 wks off. he really needs this job but i m very close to telling him to quit and find something else. any thoughts  i m in arkansas  thinking our water will be polluted as well since the ohio river runs into the ms river.
how far out in distance do you think the toxicity has spread  thank you for sharing your info
she was saying it be a bigger environmental disaster than bp that s all
@macduece2112   can someone please comment on where ohioans should move too  is all of ohio unsafe now or just east palastine  we are only one a hour from here and i m not sure if we should try to move or not
@clairedgaia3626  yes  that s what was used to control the gulf oil spill.
fukushima
correct!!!
@johnstacey956  i am saying ohio is way bigger than macondo with way less coverage.
the superfund site is ukraine because ...............well  you know the thing.
so terrible sad how tis evil people will literally transform this poor town into scene form the hills has eyes . my god   everyone should evacuated somehow someway
david suzuki said the same thing.  you can t take chemicals from water there is no such filter to remove.
it still blows my mind how so many people still believe what these corrupt monsters say!  they are downplaying this because of money! unbelievable!
@clairedgaia3626  do you mean dispersants rather than desiccants  headlines about studies suggested that the chemicals used did more harm than good. i don t know about that one way or the other. like you  i am so amazed by the revival in kentucky. prayers for the poor people in ohio who need our governments assistance.
@makeitpay8241 you are joking  right
i did hazmat  for ten years and schooled 80-100 hrs. a yr  to stay lic. i heard the chemicals  or sop side chemicals. i question there s no hazmat manifest  amounts
sencer me again  . amounts carried   train car numbers and chemicals  were placards marked correct for chemical carried
ask her again quite possibly the valdez oil spill back in 70s or 80s i think she s comparing it to the the area that the oil spread up there along the alaska coastline how far is the waters carried the oil something similar to that it was huge. well like i said ask her again she might explain.
@pablocasiano1  god we need you now!!! watch the video!!!
through the use of phytoextraction   willow trees. they should be able to clean a lot of this up  but it will take time.
guitar daddio   perhaps equal to love canal.
@decorbychelsea  notice how no one has an answer for you. i m in michigan  according to the map i saw the winds just skirt the bottom of the state and water doesn t flow to here. we get our water from the great lakes.  don t know where the lakes get water from although  yesterday  i saw some black  smokey smudge in the sky. i don t know what that means. basically  no where on the planet  or plane  if you prefer  is safe. maybe  israel. you don t hear about things like this happening there. and it is the  promised  land. that said  they won t welcome you with open arms. they would feel about you  the way we feel about mexicans crossing over here.
only christ can end these evils.
this is seriously so heartbreaking. i have been praying for these people and the animals including the fish ever since i heard of this. it s so sad that this derelict government is treating them as though they are pawns. they deserve help!
guitar daddio i m not a geoscientist  but i have 20  years experience as a driller for oil  gas  water  gold  silver  silver  almost anything modern humanity poles holes in the ground for. i have experience working with geoscientists and phd level hydrologists and i absolutely completely concur with your entire comment  well said my friend.
the    1970 s love canal  chemical  atrocity n  western  new  york  niagarafalls  ny.  is comparable  however  not  as  fr  reaching  as  east palestine.
@mrbillmechanic  yes. hooker chemical.
@clairedgaia3626  do you mean corexit  i think this is the name of the stuff they used to hide the ugly oil.
as i recall it wasn t the oil that was the big concern during the bp event it was the experimental clumping chemicals that they used for the clean up that concerned people the most.
@1955dmb  because the kickbacks are more lucrative.
@mztwixed  not true. i have spent my life neutralizing and removing crap from water. getting it out of the water table is the problem.
@markcobb4693  that is my understanding too. of course  these days it is hard to know what is true. i also heard that there a natural microbes in the gulf of mexico that breakdown the oil.
@guitardaddio  you are spot on with your comment. this will affect the citizens of the entire eastern us. but  people can believe what they want to if it makes them feel safe and secure. we are in serious trouble!
you can still see the oil on the water from the  exxon valdez oil spill in 1989 on the canadian coast. it never goes away. water has memory so beyond cleaning it  it s tainted forever.
@pablocasiano1  the land  yep that s what i think they want and everyone to city.
@suepooh3822  may god give you peace.
@barbpaq  1st it was cortex  which was eating the flesh of a diver checking in the gulf. then they switched to benzene which gave me a bone marrow transplant aplastic anemia 28 years ago.
@mztwixed  is it not true that only pure water will evaporate. well then why don t we distillation our water  hhmm..
@suepooh3822  obviously
same herenerk ohioi felt like i had been gassed i didn t know anything until too late i had the furnace on it brought it in we are ok but having a lot of respiratory issues especially our dog but we are recovering
jackson mississippi  flint msomething has to change.
boiling that water will only concentrate the chemicals! i live in ohio. thankfully far from that area. my prayers are with all the folks who are being effected by this!
because of your help and advice i have been preparing my family. i have been doing daily prayer and meditation. i have been asking for god to help me bring my family close to him. been band-aids and bullets. been learning new skills and practicing old ones. your guidance has been godsent. god bless you patriot nurse  may he keeps you always. know that i love you so very much  thank you. i am 71 and still working on being the best i can be. you are an inspiration. please don t stop  we need your guidance. god bless much love
the most terrifying words in human history are  we re from the government and we re here to help -ronald reagan
so sad that this is all happening! i feel for all those that it directly affects. and it will affect us all in one form or another. greed and tyranny are destroying our world
not to mention when they burnt off the chemical it turned it in to hydrochloride.  when that mixes with moisture  even in the air it turns to hydrochloric acid
thank you for this video. i fear  almost  nothing as my faith is strong. this  though  the complete erasing of anything good in our water air and soil is terrifying. saddens me so much for the people in the vicinity of the bogus train derailment and for all of us...globally... prayers are flying every which way.
i live on a cn train line in e. central illinois.  i walk my dogs along the tracks.  so i stop and look at the cars going by when trains go by.  you would not believe the horrid stuff that s transported right through towns  and utterly unprotected.  just reading the names of things inside these 100 000 gallon railcars makes me gasp.  and last night  a gang of young hoodlums put some debris on the tracks to  i don t know  see what it would do when the train hit it.  it sounded like a car accident  but the train kept going.  if it derailed  it d be in my front living room.  i m so empathetic with the folks in ohio  and praying we can recover from this.
let s not forget that these chemicals went into the ohio river. that river borders the entire state of kentucky until it connects to the mississippi river  which in turn goes all the way to the gulf of mexico.
on the local media the head of epa was asked to drink some water after the all clear  he refused.  people are getting out of showers with rashes.  nuff said.best bet is to cut your losses and move if you are within 30 mile radius  maybe more.  your health is more important.
blackrock  vanguard and jp morgan chase own norfolk southern and the media!  they are responsible for this!   i live in ohio. 173 miles away from this event  but i have a friend 20 miles from there.  this makes my blood boil!
this is a sad and dangerous situation for all those people. i m sure the government will lie about this  just like the pokey was safe and effective.
i have had to deal with hazmat on a daily basis at my job and taking industrial hygiene classes i have learned that this kind of a spill is really bad. i feel for these people because that s going to effect the area for a long time!!!!!
i definitely value a simple summary of these issues since i went way too far down the conspiracy rabbit hole. far enough to mess up my mental health. so even though i know where to go to find the info i stay away. like you say  from your summary and the comments  the fallout sounds like it is going to be huge. some things are so big that even government suppression cannot keep the lid on.
there was a movie called  white noise  which came out in 2022 on netflix. the movie was filmed around palestine  ohio. with train wreck  chemical explosion  toxic cloud and contamination of the air  water with the population getting sick.
the same creeps that are telling people that it s safe are also the creeps telling people to fear co2 which is needed to grow food. we are really in trouble.
i know that a lot of these families are screaming that they don t have the money to stay elsewhere and they can t leave their only source of income to start over somewhere else. what a painful position to be in!however  would you rather do that or have your health possibly impacted in ways we still can t imagine let s hope people can band together and try to help these people! i don t have any idea how to start a funding page  but reply to this if you hear of one that s been established
you re such a queen. you keep things so very real. thank you for what you do. i share this with my friends who live there.
so much calamity from so many directions.we re going to suffer  brothers and sistersbut we re going to be alright.prayers for ya ll s inner peace.
rock   a hard place...so horrible.truly feel for citizens caught in this. we know who loves this tragedy.enemies of humanity
i heard it has gone via the river all the way thru kentucky to indiana. my brother and my 92 yr old father are in hanover indiana. how flicking far is this going to go and turn places all around the river into wasteland me thinks the storm is upon us.
yes. that s what i was thinking!
17  these are the signs that will accompany those who believe  in my name they will drive out demons. they will speak in new languages. 18  and they will pick up snakes with their hands.even if they drink any deadly poison it will not hurt them  and the ll place their hands on the sick  and they ll recover.
@christinepound5889  oh i am very well aware of that  however it doesn t change the fact that this is an excellent quotation and is factually correct.
@isaac357mag    true. but definitely controlled opposition.
@isaac357mag  just not applicable.
@noitisnt-ns7mo  after hurricane katrina i m going to disagree with you.
reagan was no saint either.
@pberbluecobra  sounds like you have a personal problem with wise and truthful sayings.
@pberbluecobra   i do not. while that statement is 100  true reagan did damage to the 2nd amendment like djt did. while both did seemingly more good than bad they both did damage to our country. what damage did they do to the 2nd amendment
but they aren t even trying to help
also borders wv pal what about them
it is now a 200 mile radius at least.  the toxins got into the ohio river  then the mississippi river.  ten states are affected.  bp earth watch has a good video on this.
@christinepound5889  so sad   what a long term nightmare to the environment.
@barbpaq   i saw that. evil beyond belief
those who took hot showers in that water are now dead ducks walking.  they aerosolized the toxic steam and breathed it all into their lungs without thinking.
instead of routing billions to ukraine spend it here!!!
it was done on purpose
pretty soon  someone in new orleans might scream   i see dead people in boats !
the crowd member needed to be offering a drink of water right on camera to the epa guy.   asking him he only spun his way out of it.every oh repub elected official needs to be on this - more important even than hearings.
we are the co2
@juliecross7003  yep
that always cracked me up! lol
i love co2!
photosynthesis. trees take in co2 and give off oxygen.
@trevorharildstad  exactly!
@juliecross7003  exactly gates of hell equation and talk of reducing co2.
maybe one of the big channels or someone like jbp could start something.  i m a brit.  i d chip in cos your bloody government won t.  so sorry to see this.
@equisader whitehorse   you just made me cry these last few minutes. what a sweet offer ! i know you re having trouble in your country as well. those 15 minute cities and the problems with the power companies to name a few.  noone does insults better than the brits and scots. humorous people too. never forget as we continue on that we americans love you. we are family after all. ahh   now i m crying again. what s wrong with me   take care of yourself okay  much love   and tissues  from northern california.
jesus is coming soon. love you  family.
blackrock owns huge interest in the train company and will probably buy up all of the farm land for pennies on the dollar. we are so engulfed in evil.thanks for the info!
can tell how hard this was to make for you... thank you for the work you do!!! you really are an angel!
praying for all in this area of ohio. stay safe. god bless you and your families. thank you so much pn
this was another calculated attack indirectly on our food supply !
i feel so bad for the people who live anywhere near there and have no choice but to stay. it s heartbreaking  and will be even more so as the affects on their health start showing. i m supposed to go on a trip to the cincinnati area  90 mins away from the derailment  for several days in june  but now i m concerned. i know it s months away  but i ve got cancer  and am supposed to be extra careful. but  even if i weren t a cancer patient i d still be concerned. this sounds like it s going to be a long term issue. and  as an aside  we can t overlook the impact that this has on food supply. can t eat contaminated meat how much longer are we going to trust  and depend upon  a corrupt government
thank you for your sacrifice in order to make a difference  yes  it s gonna be way worse than people can imagine pray  pray  pray my friends
i live 20 minutes from e. palestine. when they blew the rail cars it got dark here  i mean night dark  like 7pm all day for three days.  i was not aware of what chemical was on the train and didn t know for several days after it blew.  so we breathed in this air and it went into our bodies from our pores  nose and mouth.  all three of us who live in this house got nausea  then diarrhea but just i also was throwing up for about 6 hours or so.  the poor souls in e. palestine are in effect on the front line so to speak but the effect of this will go much further out than just there.  people  and i understand  if i wasn t here i would do the same thing  think the explosion poison is somehow only affecting e. pal.  there was a guy in ontario who was complaining that he and his family were suffering terrible burns in their eyes  tearing and that they were overwhelmed with the stench of chlorine.  the particle path of this poison gas goes from e.p. north through erie pa to canada. i mean the poison released in this first three days.  we are detoxing as best as possible.  i avoided the bio weapon shot and even being tested for covid only for this.  and this was purposeful  there is not a doubt in my mind.
thank you so much for spreading the truth about this disaster!!
i live 90 mins south of this disaster  along the ohio river and the local news is not saying much about this. all the local towns are just telling everyone the water and air are good to go
hi patriot nurse.. i just found you by seeing many people mentioning you on other site s.  i m a retired rn and agree with everything you said. i warned my sister in ky  but oh no  the officials say it s safe. i will be following you now.god bless you!
leaving everything you have is devastating  but in this case i would say do it anyway. after all  leave it now and possibly escape the worst. stay and later on you and your family will most likely leave in body bags anyway. my heart goes out to these people.
its scary and a shame this is happening. unfortunately they have to make that dreaded decision to get the heck out of there with their lives!  then they all need to start a massive lawsuit!
my heart breaks for the families in the spill and surrounding areas
thank you so much much for  being a voice of truth and caring so much to getting it out for others to hear. you are appreciated very much in these times and what we are dealing with
if the people responsible would own up to the tragic situation they would be helping the entire town find homes far away from the poisonous situation. every person is worth saving their lives.
would i be correct to assume that this will eventually work its way down the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico also into the tennessee river. we are just been attacked from inside and nobody knows
the whole situation makes me sick! so heartbroken for the people of ohio and surrounding area! there will be so much death and suffering
as a former chemist myself  also still got all my old books and notes   i think the only thing that might be used is a carbon filter or reverse osmosis. the glycol either  eb iirc  is something i used to work with. the vinyl chloride and butyl    acrylate are particularly nasty actors.
remember they were just sayin how dangerous it is using a gas stove ...but setting 1 million  lbs of vinyl chloride on fire is no big deal
praying for the safety of those effected.
thank you for being here   dear
then build apartments right on top of toxic waste.
they should move their families there
that s what i was thinking too
blackrock could use a boston tea party.
vanguard has a large share too.  peace and love
and that was probably their ultimate goal no doubt!
your comments are the same thing  i said five hours ago!
i was thinking the same thing about blackrock.
welcome to corporate feudalism
i m so sorry
i m so sorry. this is so wrong!
i will pray for everyone!  stay strong!
i too am sorry for what happened to you. it so isn t right!  big hugs and prayers. i hope your detoxification helps. there are herbs and supplements that assist in that  as i m sure you already know.
praying for you all
don t claim that cancer! don t speak that into existence in your bodies! renounce that expectation immediately   curse the cancer. pray over your body   your family s bodies for protection. we have the power of life   death in our words. god is much bigger than this chemical spill!
my heart breaks for everyone affected by this. i am praying for you and everyone else who is going through this.
@jtika1978  read this person s comment.  i plied the blood of christ overs the souls and bodies of the people who have any contact with this attack.  stay prayed up everyone.  sos to the lord
i am so sorry toojesus...
holy moly
@jtika1978  amen.  completely agree with you.  never claim cancer.  rebuke it  refute it  deny it.  refuse it.
i m the same distance and fortunately no health concerns but theres definately something coming down in the little bit of rain we ve had.
they did not  blow  the rail cars. it was a controlled vent  drain and burn.
and all whose water is will be made toxic from this
family s for sure and all the wild life
can anyone comment on how safe the water is for people who live about an hour away  our elevation is higher here but not sure if our water is safe
don t feel too bad  is coming to an airspace and water source near you. it s already in canada and will spread everywhere soon enough
i fear for all of us in this country  people are not waking up fast enough..... i pray every day for all of my fellow americans...
@david exactly!
sick  those psychopaths!
good point.
i am in agreement with you so don t take this as being against but it probably was already on fire because of heat from derailment but i  don t know this for fact but from the begining on the news it was burning.
@jamesh.maloyjr.6940  it wasn t already on fire  it was a controlled burn... under expert supervision they released the vinyl chloride of 5 rail cars into troughs that was then ignited. apparently that was the best solution
right
@unclehobby6296  you are 100  right.  what i heard is they couldn t pump it out of the railroad cars because it might ignite it. but then how could they pump it out into the trenches and set it ablaze and not pump it into a truck and haul it away. something doesn t jive.
always a reliable and insightful  commentary. makes me proud of your strength.patriot nurse thanks for being you !
anything that is broadcasted nationwide is never unplanned or by mistake.
so here s an idea   you put a bottle of water  that has this chemical in it  in the freezer. water will freeze at about 0 celsius  while 2-butoxyethanol at -77. when the water is frozen  the other chemical should  still be liquid  you get rid of the liquid  rinse the top ice a bit  and you should have a clean bottle of ice water.  thoughts
i m an hour and a half from there in ohio. i m also close to the bedford foundry explosion that happened yesterday and cities from miles around could smell it...the police actually had to issue a statement that people needed to avoid calling the police about the chemical smell.
75 000 farms in ohio and 90   are family or individually owned. i would love to know the percentage of people that took these   my guess it s not a high number. i would say many states in the surrounding area have similar types of people.they need to destroy as many as they can that could possibly survive and become independent from the coming system.
thank you patriot nurse for all that you do
this was no accident the only thing that might work to remove it from the water is a series of filters  active charcoal  lime stone  salt  clay  things that soak up and break down the compounds.
i would like to point out  that after seeing videos of people using rocks and sticks to stir the ground under the water and seeing what looks like chemicals floating to the top. seems to me that these chemicals are heavier than water and sinks to the bottom. it makes me think that the water they test is probably clean  at least what s being told to us all.  however the problem is still lurking below what is being tested.
the old soldiers have known this for a while. between 1990 and 2008  mefloquine was given to soldiers of the u.s. and allies. millions of soldiers developed symptoms that mimic ptsd and tbi. they realized that these symptoms were developed by larium toxicity and in 2008  the army and the fda blacklisted it. to this day  the cdc still recommends mefloquine as a prevention for malaria.
i agree with you...leave! i d rather be homeless in another state with good health than stay and have my health affected. god bless all those impacted by this horrible event
in east liverpool  18 miles away   had sore throat since incident  distill my well water  but i have literally no where else to go with kids  dogs  cats  chickens   ect. pray for all of us.
i appreciate all the hard work you do for us giving us the truth  beauty and brains
no way i would stay there. i d rather be homeless in my vehicle in a safer area. i already had to do that once due to toxic mold in 2 homes we lived in.. we lost everything and had to start over but thanks to the kindness of others as well as local program emergency housing we did ok. thankfully we didn t have to change the immediate township area where we lived. sending prayers for all affected
yes  it s very suspicious! praying for the poor people  animals  fish   fowl in that whole area
hey pn  i hope you re doing great. with regards to this spill  is there any guidance on ways to filter the water in an effective way  even bigger picture  has anyone investigated the cause of this and other very tragic railroad derailments recently  i ve seen articles on shunts used to cause derailments. has anyone talked about ia deliberate cause for this  and other derailments
if we the people don t come together and stand against this evil government  this kind of insane warfare against the citizens of this country will continue!! praying for our fellow citizens in ohio!!
i live in the louisville ky area and our water comes from the ohio river and all the stores are already out of bottled water around here...prayers for all of us god keep your hand on us
i appreciate your honesty when we aren t being told the truth. doesn t sound like there is a solution right now.thanks for continuing to dig into this.we need to pay attention and make choices as the lord leads us. if we need to move and get out  let it be so without hesitation!
it s just sick what has happened there in ohio! this was planned for sure! i can t even imagine what them people are going through! scary thing it  this can happen anywhere  as we are all under attack by these evil doers!
hello pn  the very first thought that comes to mind upon having heard this story about this disaster is the railroad man saying he something to the tune of there being overworked and in need of more people. the probability that the american way of getting rid of people that work for you and make the ones you keep work twice as hard is probably what s at fault. that s just my initial gut feeling without having done any research whatsoever and only hearing about it twice. it s a damn shame her that this is what we live in.
maybe at least clean enough to filter a few times and use...good thinking.  i would be interested to hear a professional opinion on this idea.
@mikehunt-co7hc  it depends how the molecules are bound together. cold separation doesn t work in all cases. i would also like to hear a chemist and pass this question on  because there is a potential to help many people.
that s an interesting theory
the rage is boiling inside of me
that s interesting
the beast system
intel corp is building a chip plant there.
brit here.  i was thinking along these lines too.  is ohio a big red state   as you say probably low vax and they want them gone.  i wonder if there are important deposits of something under these farms.
you are correct my friend. this is punishment for the unvaxxed  the farmers and people who live off the grid there
good point!
i am sweetheart. payment coming  sooner or later.
i am so sorry this happened to you and everyone in that area. i am praying for everyone. this touches all of us no matter where we are.
can you document your experience and add it to your yt page  people like you will be the only thing we have for finding the truth of the devastation.
what the devil meant for evil god will turn to our good  i pray that god will deliver all of you effected by this chemical spill in jesus name trust in the lord with all your hearts.
forget the animals  just worry about yourself and your children.  but whatever
i hear you dear one and i m praying.  we are working class people  we can t just leave a job and become homeless .people don t realize it is hurtful when they give advice to pick up and leave when one doesn t have a choice.
@minniegranny5079  thank you. you get my situation. recently divorced   on ssi  supporting 2 daughters and 2 grandchildren. i must trust my holy jesus now more than ever. thank you so much for understanding.
almighty god  lord jesus. please touch   help the people children animals with your love  grace   mercy. thank you father god !!!
@jusaman9292  thank you!
we live 20miles from this disaster we just bought our house here a few months ago. i m pregnant and have a toddler. where the heck would we go
@lcm4951  god bless you   sweetheart! praying for you and all of us to stay safe in this storm!
sending prayers for you all.
@deenanick3772  cant thank you enough for your prayers for all of us. god will see us through   as he did the hebrew children so long ago. no pestilence will come nigh our dwellings.
@lcm4951  do you have a relative out of state  or somewhere far away   if you have children and baby on the way  how can you not go!  i d pack everything i can get in the car and head out!  contact your insurance company and tell them you need funds for lodging somewhere or house rental  this should be covered under natural disasters or acts of god as an accident.  just trying to offer some suggestions.  you will get sick if you don t go.
prayers from georgia  i am so sorry this environmental crime has happened to those in ohio and pennsylvania. i am sharing the truth about this crime every chance i get. stay strong!
city water has been treated and tested daily
also in lousiville  brandenburg  area.    we have a rain water catchment system and a distiller
@missingremote4388  but i m not so sure i trust them.
@brendawhitehouse980  i m sure i don t trust them.
louisville water company says they are monitoring the ohio river  they don t expect anything toxic to get to louisville  the river will take care of it s self.   they re words .    guess we ll see how that pans out.
@brenda whitehouse  thank you sooo very much for your report on your area! this is sooo bad.
@jackieliner3812   yes that s what they have said but if you listened to each person the news has interviewed have said almost the same thing and that was 3 different people.
@brendawhitehouse980  each got their   talking points memo   from a single government agency.
@spottheborgcat6523  exactly!!!!
rain catchment may be only alternative. water bottles are getting scarce south of louisville as well.
prayers from virginia
@missingremote4388  that is what they are saying in cincinnati also   they say no butyl acetate is turning up. they are testing for a plethora of chemicals. but they have turned off the pumps as a precaution . they are using whatever was in the tanks already to supply the populace until   when  i don t know.
i live in wv along the ohio river between point pleasant  wv and huntington  wv. we were told by channel 3 news to not use the water  to use it for flush only. now they are saying all up and down the ohio river the water is fine go ahead and drink it. however  we have asked for the water testing reports  but they will not show them to us! they are lying to everyone and all of us. god help us all.
@amyghanim520  irresponsible of them to say drink the water  but not where they got that info
@amyghanim520  you need to collect water from your own tap and get it independently tested. it might be expensive to run whatever series of tests needed  but def worth it! don t wait for the govt to offer.
god bless you ma am and thank you for putting out your videos  giving us information!
for everyones information it would be nice if a weather person or whomever deals with wind currents  etc. make a map of the directions the winds go for weeks or months whichever is appropriate!  that way one can see where the contamination by air would go...
the first thing that comes to my mind is it s not a local disaster it s a national disaster. besides the water  what role does ohio play in food security for the united states  is it also possible that the contamination can spread to other parts of the country
the effect of this spill will not be known in total for years to come. the amount of chemicals spilled was such a failure in the system that it looks like the whole system needs to be redone from bottom to top. it should have been contained and cooled and pumped out. if i lived in that town i would be packing. prayers go out to all affected.
god is watching. once again thank you p n.although i don t live there   sand pit state  my heart goes out to all there and future residents also plus down stream people and critters.l
yes ma am. this is a major catastrophe. it will be years before that area should be inhabited and nothing should be grown or eaten anywhere near there for miles.
how this chemical spill was being treated lets me know that i better start stepping up my fundraising game like my life depends on it.  since i m raising money to survive the next ten years  it does.  i m just going to spend that money on getting as prepared as possible in five aspects  physically  mentally  digitally  psychologically  and spiritually  for the disasters that are coming a decade from now.
we really have to focus on taking care of our fellow americans our government has been totally compromised by evil at all levels both parties are morally bankrupted and are controlled by the federal reserve banksters we have to give to christian organizations that will get provisions and money  to the people in ohio.thank you patriot nurse for your courage and honest and truthful information  si much respect and love
who would have known these chemicals have such a high boiling point that it s useless to try  this needs to go viral. why is nobody else saying this
thank you for making this video. been on the ground since day 1 covering this. so many many questions and no answers given.
the only commercially available water filtration system that may work  that i can think of  is the grayl.i use their geopress because it is rated for chemicals  pesticides and viruses  but further research is needed.
shalom from the ohio valley i live 2 1 2 hours away from palestine ohio. my gs dog was experiencing severe respiratory issues about 4 days after this event i felt like i was gassed. we are still having issues  heart palpitations   headaches and when the temperature goes up the effects are worse  we are on prednisone and other allergy medication even my dog. this went over the entire state of ohio.
god bless. thank you for sharing. i and my church are praying for those affected by this in ohio! to god be the glory. no weapon formed against you will prosper!
this is absolutely horrible and tragic.  it is already too late for some.  heartbreaking.  it blows my mind that those who profess so loudly about caring for the environment are silent and or unconcerned.
i m 30 miles from here and while they were doing the  controlled  burn the winds shifted right towards us. we were advised to shelter in place. i haven t cooked with drank the water since. they are not being honest.
the fallout from the chemical smoke cloud has covered miles and miles.
i live in alabama  so far away from this problem  but i fear it will eventually trickle down to us. i have a whole house reverse osmosis and rezoning water filtration system. would this be effective for filtering something like this out of the water  i m currently in the process of washing out old 2 liter soda bottles and refilling them with purified drinking water  so as to stay ahead of this or any other contingency that comes along.
thank you so much for all your efforts on this  and all your videos on general.  i have friends just at the wv md boarder  near morgantown.  i m wondering if you think there is a great threat there.  it s very close to friendsville  md.  near the youghiogheny river  which seems to be flowing north.
i see your tears and share the concern. keep spreading the word. thank you
as a retired chemical technologist  your video was very informative because i specialized in ceramics research.
yes wind  ohio river flows into mississippi river  contaminated food sold. also  bottled water!  turned out nestle was selling california tap water.
...food security....  that s a huge concern. will anyone really want to eat food grown within 500 miles of this spill -- for decades
@blainenay  further than that!  reports in canada and what s in the ohio river goes into the mississippi river!
i heard someone say it could affect up to 1000 miles beyond spill site.  unknown if true
all those rivers flow south. then to the gulf of mexico. and ladies and gentlemen food cans don t say made in ohio so we are not going to know if they can  bad food or not.
@fyvejeekilz801  for scale  evansville  in is 700 mi downstream on the ohio r. from the source.
@jamesh.maloyjr.6940  kroger is headquartered in ohio.
exactly 100
so who s the one who decided to set this chemical on fire
@christisking8101   the kroger brand bottled water i have is bottled in cincinnati. that s ohio river sourced water. i guess i ll have to start drinking whiskey instead of water.
yes via the waterways. more so if it gets into underground water.
@sl4983  the epa
there was already acid rain in western pa
and water for animals.
yes ely. this is now a national disaster. it s worse than they say.
@stubeast4031  i used til now buy gallons of their distilled water for my prep.  i hear ya on the whiskey.  except my buffalo trace had to double in price. smh.
@christisking8101  i can t find buffalo trace anywhere. i hear they are in a major dispute with their largest distributor. brings a tear to my eye. i do love buffalo trace.
ohio is a major agricultural state.
because they think we are all so stupid that they can say and do anything they please. so that s what they do.
useless to try what
@sl4983 i think they mean it has a high boiling point that people can not reach  so it would be hard to boil things out of it...i m gonna guess this is talking about the water contamination.  i m not sure myself..but gbu and stay safe.
because they don t know yet!
water boils at 100 c  the chemicals pn referred to have boiling point of 171 c. boiling water will never reach 171 c. essentially   when you boil the water long enough   it will just evaporate  you will be left with the chemicals in the pot. distillation of water might be more effective   but then again  we need the list of all chemicals and their byproducts to know their boiling point. because certain chemicals have closer boiling point to water and the water vapor can accumulate together with those chemical vapors in a distillate. need to know the chemical list to determine if distillation will be effective.
@sl4983 - they were telling people to boil there water before drinking  but it s not like bacteria.  you can t kill the bad stuff with boiling and make it potable  drinkable  water.
get out of there asap
i have one too... following your comment
the government will leave them to die  it sickens me how inept and corrupt our government is.
what about the crops grown in this large area  after it rained  a lot of the plume and chemicals in the air fell to the ground across a very large area  possibly several states. wheat and corn will still be grown for various products and also feed for livestock. this is going to impact everyone!
thank you for sharing all your knowledge you are a blessing for humanity
i agree with you. it s going to be disaster because of these chemicals being released.
sadly i don t think many can leave. where would they go  i know if something like that happened here i couldn t afford to just leave and go somewhere else. i pray for god to provide for those in need and that want to get out of there  but can t. i pray for his protection over them as well.
such great content! thank you so much for the bible verses  very encouraging!!
i use to transport hazmat materials over the road  when a accident happens like this  they handled it all wrong  suites and breathing equipment is required and all surrounding area s are to be quarantined and tested for toxins  evacuate all people from the area and test them for poisons toxins.i was trained to deal with spills accidents  special hazmat teams are suppose to come in and do the clean up  not the fire dept s.here s the deal folks  we re being attacked by the oligarchs  it s plain and simple  it s fact on what s happening right now.welcome to the kosher cosa nostra people.
thank you for all you do patriot nurse.
amen  i agree   listen to your discernment. may god bless and help these families and their animals . the government needs to compensate them for their loss asap. although they need to leave now.
blessings of yah over us all! we are in a mess please stay on  your prayer bones as grandma milly use to say! thank you for your honesty and your knowledge pn .
would charcoal capsules and intermittent fasting help in a situation like this
thank you for the information. how far north  south  east and west of east palestiine oh do you think will be affected not only by the water but the mushroom cloud of chemicals that went up  i live in ohio and would like to know how far it can affect people. can the water tables be affected by this and possibly affect those of us on wells  once again thank you and god bless you!
i feel sorry for the wildlife and rare species that are only along the ohio river watershed  especially the amazing salamanders  including the one named  hellbender  cryptobranchus alleganiensis
the true measure of the dereliction of responsibility by those who chose to burn this  after all a decision to burn was made   will be the penumbra of toxicity. it could well enclose most of the eastern us  as well as the great lakes. i m prayin hard   and hopin for god s mercy on our country...thankyou for the awesome videos and what you re doing.
there was a movie called white noise  out last year  that the very thing happened in ohio as in the movie in ohio!i feel was deliberate ! praying for everyone
the patriot nurse is someone whom u should listen to!!!!    thank u for all ur efforts!
i live 2 hours northeast of the disaster. i ve been getting strange chills with no fever or other symptoms. anyone else
very good info from pn  another good source if you want to know just how large scale this will be is from david dubyne  adapt 2030- he breaks this disaster all down and it s beyond what anyone could have imagined  i m in prayer you should be to..
if we are not in the end times now  we are in the next closest thing  at least from what i have seen happening over the past decade plus.  my heart and prayers go out to all who are  and will be  affected by this disaster.  thank you  patriot nurse  for your coverage of this issue.
i respect your advice and i thank you for giving it to me.
and encourage them to drink the water!
yes   such a shame!  this was intentional. i m sure our current administration knows all about it . god bless everyone!
you think they ll put them in smart cities  that be possibly end goal  i just wish people would wake up
they are not inept  it is with intent.
@kathleenfuller2272  exactly!
@bettymcclellan2164  i am beginning to see that anyone that do see what s happening are born again believers or those who believe in jesus christ it amazes me that at this point since cov d there are those who don t see the crime that is being done to humanity
evil. they are from the father of lies.
you really don t know the half of it.  it s most likely intentional  not negligent.
those rules only apply to smaller companies and non political connected corporations.i m sure black-rock who owns a big chunk of the railroad will get special treatment.
well it was easy to sooth people s nerves with the one thousand dollar check they handed out.hopefully people will by bottled water to drink at least for a while.
yep.
so tore says  says that it was probably a cover up of the ingredients to make phentanle that were on the train  and it has something to do with human organs.
@jamesh.maloyjr.6940  the pores of the skin can take in the poisons. also steam in a shower  inhaled chemicals. prayers for everyone.
@sl4983  do you mean fentanyl
kosher cosa nostra
yes!! i think ca will be their next target. ranchers are already showing videos of these trains parked on railroad with hazardous chemical stickers. ranchers are asking questions why are these being parked here all of a sudden. this is in central valley all farm land.
@algonzalez4716  - i heard of this today as well...
@algonzalez4716  saw that.
yes. and all those firemen and cops and whoever else was just standing around watching the fire and the smoke are going to be screwed. unbelievable.
blame the jews  makes you hard to take seriously.
@acinfla9615  absolutely  when i heard they owned this that was all i need to know this will be covered up as much as possible.
i would like to know this too. i m 60 miles west.
i agree - i am just heartbroken about the animals both wild and domestic.  how are they going to have drinkable water   it is just horrible and the gov is just trying to hide it.
matthew 24 beginning of sorrows!
birth pains
hang on tight its going to get so much worse than this   jesus come quickly
agreed. give your life to jesus christ
thanks for your research. what a mess  i feel for ohio.
patriot nurse i added this to my train derailments playlist. also my water purification and sanitization playlist. along with number of very informative and helpful videos
i live in gothenburg  nebraska and we just had our third train derailment in 6 months today  and it keeps happening in the same spot on the track because they re not repairing it correctly and they keep running the train cars too long  about 2 miles long for some of them .  at least it was only coal  but they still had about 15 backhoes out there trying to get the track cleared off.  this is 30 miles from the largest rail yard in the world  so it backs the trains up all the way into the railyard when they have to shut any of the tracks down.
our government taking care of their own had always been as joke. we the american people take care of each other. unfortunately for these folks  being a small community  most folks entire family lives in the area  for generations often   have no one to bug out  to. no where to go. bless them   keep them.
we saw how honest they were about the flint  mi  water. also the fact that nothing was really done about it either.
good information. i will definitely warn people about this. thank you!
no one should be relying on the government for assistance or advice. they do not have the best interest of the people at heart. people need to think for themselves. in this particular instance  these are called forever chemicals for a reason.
pray everyone pray like you ve never prayed before  love you too patriot nurse
remember that old line about someone being being from the government and here to help being a sign of dangerous lies  well  i think it is well past time to extend this to ns and most private corporations of a certain size and unaccountability. ns sent people over to offer to test the water over where the train wreck happened  but first the households had to sign waivers in which they agreed not to sue the company for any potential or actual damages.  doesn t that sound suspicious
very helpful information. thanks for taking the time to share it with us.  sincere regards.
the lies about chernobyl was what triggered the fall of the soviet union.
thank you for helping us all with your care.
hi pn  live 79 miles west. praying for my fellow buckeyes  and those in western pa  and northern west by god almost heaven  virginia. agree   never trust the government for the truth. time will tell how bad the ecological disaster will be downriver on the ohio. meanwhile let s shoot down a few more  15 hobby balloons.it is so good to see you back posting regularly. god bless  bob
won t argue against your bp oil spill example  but the first thing that popped into my mind was  love canal ........ people were being told  everything s fine  all while children  babies  young adults etc kept coming up with  rare  and  unusual  diseases. final conclusion was people were living on top of an old chemical dump site.
we need to step up as patriots to help these people who have no where to go. the government is not going to help them. i have 3 4 of an acre. that i am willing to donate to a family in need. i am an older lady with health issues of my own. so i can t do much. but i know that my community would help this family in need. please anyone who can help to relocate these people. we need to help them.
i m into natural medicine but i think your knowledge is very valuable to
how awful for the animals that don t have the choice to move. i am praying for all.
im in pittsburgh pennsylvania and have had nose bleeds everyday a few times a day since day after train derailment. it started with one then my nose started running all the time and the more i blow my nose the more it s bleeding. my voice has changed and my throat is tight and hurts. my 10 year old is having same symptoms as well as both of us experiencing body aches in lower extremities. 3 days after accident we had to go out in rain to get bus to apt and that was when we got far worse...
i love your heart. thank you for the real science information. thoughts and prayers to all in palestine  oh and beyond. god help us.
this message is to the patriot nurse. long-time viewer here. i know you re busy and this message is off topic but youtube has removed  from my saved list  one of the videos you did about polio. the video you did about polio on october 19th  2018 is still available. it s the other one that is gone. i do not have the date that you posted the missing video and i only remember the word polio being in the title. i went through all of the videos on your channel and it s not there either. my daughter has a newborn baby and we re trying to decipher what  if any  vaccines the baby should get. is there another place where i can find that video  i don t know who else to trust. ty
a army ranger put his wits in an idea and brought it to reality. he gave it to michigan. it s really dope and right on time. look into it   it s time.
what was that about history repeating itself
i lived through that
what ! ! that had noting to do with the downfall of the soviet union!!!
the soviet union has not  nor has it ever fallen
@countrybiscuit3856  in such cases it is still falling.
@countrybiscuit3856  is the berlin wall not down  did not the soviet union divide into many countries  didn t many countries that were controlled by the soviets join the nato
@thefrogking481  yes. it did.
two years after the humiliating withdrawal from afghanistan the ussr colllapsed. how long has it been since brandon humiliated the usa withdrawing from afghanistan
@thesuperioraffection4502  that actually proves superiority of capitalism over communism
thank you for your love for the truth in bringing information on this. thank you again
thank you for the information.boiling chemical polluted water will not remove them. these aren t bacteria or viruses. people need to understand that difference. it is life saving.
this is so serious that it makes the love canal seem like a walk in the park!  and that area had to be abandoned!  these people need to be relocated and reestablished in a clean new community!  then the whole area needs to be sanitized in a huge way and large scale! that s a huge expense for the company and the epa who authorized this horrible shipment!
love you lady! keep speaking up! your voice is powerful! i adore and appreciate the truth your speak! keep talking! i left health care i can t do it anymore!
thank you pn   love ya   this was the best concise news brief  prolly the only one.  god bless you and god have his shroud of protection around over you  in jesus name  amen.
if i had to leave because of the potential danger of staying  i d keep track of all of my evacuation expenses including gas  food  lodging and medical expenses by stashing my receipts in a plastic zip lock bag. i believe i may have to prove my loses so i d inventory my home belongs  rooms  outside views of the house  garage contents   every thing left behind with video.
i appreciate all your work.
i live in ohio. i am about 2.5 hours away from east palestine in a city called heath. our water system here in heath ohio comes from underground aqueducts and our water treatment plant sits right next to the licking county river  i do believe... what s the likelihood that our water is unsafe here too  my gut tells me to grab my family and run but financially that s impossible... i m beside myself  we are all beside ourselves.
thank you for reporting this since we can t trust what we are being told by officials.  prayers for us all.
god bless you pn for reaching out to get more info on this and sharing it.i am praying-praying-praying.... god have mercy  pour out his grace and wisdom. truth and justice.
i wonder if we won t see more of these spills as a way of forcing us all into cities. there are lines and lines of tankers that are currently sitting out on tracks in california near a lot of ranches there. they were just left out there. they are full and the ranchers out there are afraid that something is going to cause them to tip over as has occurred recently in other places in the states. something causes them to just tip over  releasing all the liquids. i think we will see more of this.
thank you for your research and for sharing!  god bless and keep you
i am now  highly suspect  of everything said  by any government personnel or agency.
thank you for making this video.  i am an ep resident and am concerned about our well being  equally concerned for our neighbors in negley 3. south if the ep boarder down stream and in a lower value  had a thick chemical haze in the air all weekend of.  their was talk of heavy gas phosgene being one they were not warned or acknowledged at all  we are starting to get some focus on their wells.  next concerns are our neighbors east darlington and enon valley directly under the the plume and their water potential eventually effected by the leaching chemicals into aquifer. sadly 90  of us can t leave.  home owners are especially stuck.  we can t get close to value from our homes.  that s all many of us would have to relocate.   but for so many that have large whole families living with in a couple miles living in homes passed down thru the years they couldn t relocate in similar situation.  for my family we would leave behind our life long friends who are like family.  if you live here you know it s only a matter if time before our whole region is effected.  relocating to communities near by seems like postponing.  most of us are stuck here.
miner s took a canary with them into mines and if they died they knew the air wasn t safe. well that warning has done passed by dead fish and chicken s instantly. the canary syndrome
if you had no other choice  could you bake the water until after it gets to 340 f  i personally would go higher if possible but couldn t you use a meat thermometer and check it  the local stores are out of bottled water.
i am praying and have been for a long time. i am heartbroken about this and over the demonic destruction of america
there were 5 derailments that same week and all had chemicals involved !
i lived in sw ohio for years. the city of cincinnati water works draws most of their water from an aquifer beneath the ohio river. with all of the industry upstream    other communities dumping their wastes into the river  cincinnati runs all of the water they draw out through an activated charcoal filtering system to absorb chemicals out of the water. would activated charcoal absorb these chemicals out of the water
thanks pn  i appreciate someone with a few letters after her own name giving that advice. god bless you.
thank you  joann!
this is very similar to the exxon valdez oil spill in march 1989. one problem im having here. who was driving that train  was that person licensed to do so  was that person drunk on drugs  why isnt this being reported  and why isnt anyone asking these basic questions. durning the exxon valez we learned all this in the first 72 hours. in that case we learned the 3ed mate was in charged and not licensed in alaska waters. we learned hazelwood was drunk and had his dl revoked. we had state  federal  local  coast guard all pointing fingers at each other. lessons learned. we created servs  the rcac  and the joint pipeline office. im shocked this hasnt been done for the railroads. there are a lot of questions not being asked. looks like a major conspiracy and coverup.
i  too  have wondered about the train conductor. i haven t heard one mention of the people actually running the train. were they even injured
agree. love you  sister.    god is sovereign. jesus is coming soon.
thank you for this  pn!!! i live over 100 miles away from this and got disentary for two days while i was trying to figure out its cause. the little voice inside of my head told me that that was its cause. i m lucky to be blessed to have preparations in place to help me to deal with this. i m doing a detox  after making sure that my filtered version of the water was safe enough for me to drink. air purifier going to cleanse my air of the airborne particulates. i m now spreading the word to mt closest and deaerest on how to cope  and steps they can take to avoid what i d just gone through. like doing a simple boil test of your water to see if anything is in it that shouldn t be  and what to do if there is .
the fact that a huge amount of these potent  very toxic chemicals have entered our airstreams along with a major waterway that flows into many other major waterways   in addition to the fact that air and water are our 2 most basic needs for survival  this seems much more dangerous and to many more people than the bp spill  and on a much larger scale.
the other issue is that when they  burned these chemicals you mentioned  they turned into something called dioxin  which is highly toxic and an aspirin size amount can be fatal to a whole town of people and long term impairments to our health for decades to come.
patriot nurse keep doing these videos and telling the truth god bless you and may the lord keep you safe.
even before listening to this entire video most some of us already know we re being lied to. even on a daily biases.
your advice is sane and appropriate.
there should have been an immediate investigation and hazmat care and control setup at ground zero where people were decontaminated properly with workers in hazmat gear and decontamination stations.  instead people were told to just evacuate and threatened with arrest if they didn t.  even the first responders lives were in danger because they were not following proper hazmat protocol. the moment that it was reported anyone with basic emergency disaster training saw that.  to burn those chemicals off was a nightmare as well and that was a deliberate burning and the worst thing that they could have done.  ecru needed to go in there contain the area and remove carefully the chemicals and keep them separate as much as possible so that they would not combine into particular hazardous material that s worse on their own and burning them together created compounds that are deadly.  i studied environmental science and natural disasters and epidemiological studies at the graduate level.  the fact that they want to put biological medical bracelets on the wrists of the residents is highly suspicious when time should have been spent on containing the spill and getting people to safety to save their lives.  this is a horrific and deliberate failed response by this administration. biohazard crews should have been there immediately in bio hazmat a tire with the contamination stations were people that were contaminated would have been walkthrough showered off and given new clothing and taken to a safety zone away from ground zero.  this is going to be worse than the spill.  this is going to affect thousands of people in that area and thousands more outside of it and the entire country because this area is a major railway hub for north america.  the environmental catastrophe is separate from the attack on our infrastructure
wow  youtube actually told me you posted a video. i can not tell you how many times i found your video a couple of days later and i m still subscribed.
this is really heart breaking what s happening in ohio. other countries gets billions but nothing for americans.
you re doing a great job holding your opinion and giving new out. thanks beloved of abba.
thank you for this  and i still wonder why the people from palestine haven t mentioned that they were extras in the movie white noise  from a year ago on netflix  owned by the same company that owns the train  vanguard and blackrock !
i worked as a chemist in the past and studied remediation. a series of collection wells need to be installed immediately circling the affected area and expanded outwardly. the polluted water that seeps in needs to be pumped out and transported for refinement or disposal. most proximal location needs soil scraped and removed. proximal water ways need containment   remediated on site. this should be treated as a brownfield and geochemical engineering remediation technique applied 3 weeks ago.
thank you pn for covering this. i live 8 miles from east palestine ohio and know people that live there. it is bad there. from what they re telling me
needless to say  this will be a tragedy for many  many people. it would appear that our current administration does not intend to step up. if you recall their manifesto  you have the answer why.
thank you patriot nurse!
so weird that we still haven t seen a world wide televised speech by greta thunberg about this incident yet
p n..  thk u for listening. i noticed  and recognized  when you were moved to say what you said. many of your followers know what happened as you offered your knowledge and advice.  and  we are better off.
ohio please tell the world how you are and what s going on! tell the world we are now the daily news !
thank you for all you do   don t stop   voices such as yours should never become silent !!!
it s so scary i have cousins that live in ohio  all around disaster in train lineup and who knows what else  guidelines like air traffic would be a great idea  seriously.
i watched a video today that said not to boil it. that some of the chemicals when boiled entre the air and will make you sick. but that only a carbon filter would capture the voc s. i don t even have the link.  please make sure you research what your options are. my thoughts are with you.
@kathymc1569  thank you. i only boil it to see the contaminants are there. i m using my berkey filter system for my drinking water. i just have to be careful when i wash up and keep that water out of my eyes. i ve had to relearn how i have to do normal  everyday things.
@melodyclark4347  you are correct  and i have noticed this  as well.
i live in jacksonville  arkansas  home of vertac. in the e early 80 s they had a huge environmental crisis here involving dioxin  i believe. they still test the water ways and the fish here yearly.  and you are still warned not to eat fish from round here. i believe the rate of cancer here is probably sky high. i personally know several people that have had cancer more than once in my town. i wonder what the sids rate is. dioxin never goes away. the chem companies left  the town can t sell the land involved  so they built the new police station on it  a recycling plant on it  and since so few younger people have not even heard of it  unaware  here in the same town  now they plan to open a family park on that land. i m horrified and think it s criminal!
@liberty3338    get the mayor and city counsel aware of this  the churches and business owners also in your town. yes  people probably have forgotten about it. maybe god has reminded you to be a reminder to the others. they say   the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
had experience in military environmental health monitoring-- concur with you.
i saw a video earlier which discussed the monitoring bracelets  digital id in that area before this even happened. they were rolling them out.
you live 8 miles away from east palestine and you think you aren t in the same position they are
what are they telling you
if the boiling point of a contaminant is higher than the water  boiling the water makes it worse.effectively concentrating the contaminant as the water turns to steam  but the contaminant stays.
this same train company has had 7 derailments in the last 6 months  they aren t talking about that. there was 1 last week in michigan that dumped a container of hazardous stuff
well said!! they are keeping things quiet and under a lid! kinda like avoiding the elephant in the room!!keep smiling on!!
thank you pn for information.
thank you for sounding the alarm. tour honesty is well applauded and received. we all need to be alert to everything happening around us and share with our circle.
question. i am curious as to what these chemicals are used for  i assume they were headed to a place to have some sort of function. does anyone know  thanks.
you are a beacon of truth  light  and wisdom. i appreciate you. thank you.
thank you for this report.
or even more easily when you do a purposeful burn   oh... don t sweat it. i feel for those in the areas
so important for everyone to have their own source of water.   it s the time to stop relying on public to provide them most important necessities of life
thank you for the info and everyone who is commenting! we are the communications network now. speak out and up to let everyone know what is happening!
patriot nurse keep preaching sister god bless you and god speed is with you.
i would be asking for the rail road s hazcom doctrine and their hazcom response plain that they are required to have. some one needs to contact the chemical safety board and osha on this
thank you patriot nurse. i ve forwarded this video. by the way  it might be worse than just mismanagement. at the same time  as you so beautifully said  we are not ultimately subject to the leaders of this world. our god is a mighty god! mighty in all-powerfulness and mighty in love.
thank you  great job! prayer is the key !!
god i cannot imagine what these poor people are going to do. this is horrible on a level i cannot comprehend.  pray! everyone needs to pray!!
solid video! they wouldn t tell the truth because of the liability they now face.
we believe there is a single mom who wants to leave and is not able to afford it. we want to help her and her children get out and relocate to a safe place.
the bigger problem as shown videos. these chemicals sink down to the bottom of rivers  stream  pond  and lakes it can t be cleaned up
i will post this video on facebook.and for myself if i was impacted by this i would have packed up and left town minutes after finding out about the chemicals.
thank you   sir
silly question. the one chemical has a higher boiling point than water. what is its freezing point  it might in theory be possible to separate it out from water if it has a different freezing point. given that part of its makeup sounds like it is a glycol it might have a lower freezing point than water. in which case you put your water in the freezer  wait for the water to freeze solid and then drain off any liquid that is left over.
so sad and upsetting.  this should never have happened
one of the best resources people can study these chemicals is in the matheson gas handbook. it covers a to z regarding vinyl chloride and others. it also refers to international chemical exposure levels.
i feel so sorry for everyone living in this area. hard decisions need to be made now. i know that if i lived there  or anywhere down stream  my gut would be telling me to walk away. even if it meant walking away from a home i ve been paying on for years. without your health  you have nothing.  the partnership between wall street  corporations  and big government  aka  socialism  could not be more obvious and alarming than what we are witnessing here.
between the damage to the water and the air pollution from burning the chemicals they have destroyed literally destroyed the eastern half of the country s farmland.
i haven t heard any questions put out there about these chemicals being on a train going where and why  was this a weapon  was this catastrophe planned
171 c is 339.8 f.  since water is such a good bonding agent  you d have to crack the molecules  separate the garbage and hopefully be left with safe drinking water.
02 20 2023 hello teacher  nurse and our best friend. sorry about the errors in my last comment. my brother came in while i was writing. my bad. you are correct. the site for about  at  least 1 2 mile around the spill should be excavated to a clean depth plus some and piled for burial. this excavation shall be designed as a hazardous waste design sarcofficase with all of the special hazmat leak monitoring forever. if the excavation hit bed rock the excavation shall be widened sufficiently for a shallow burial.  this sarcofficases shall have its floor and walls shall be lined with the appropriate new clay compacted to a great tested value depth. this clay floor and walls shall be lined with the appropriate plastic  vinyl or other leak proof material. the new leak proof floor shall be covered with the new clay and tested by a licensed testing co. all of the cars rails  rails  ties  dirt  ballast rockshall be recovered nad piler for burial in the excavation for the same distance as the  edges of the required excavation to clean and tested soil. all of this material shall be shredded and placed in the sarocofficase in layers and backfiled with the excavation dirt as a compacted backfill. after all debris and excavation is in the hole and the hole is topped with the new clay  the sarocofficase shall be covered with a sealing leak prood covering  then covered with the new clay to a recommended  depth or covered with concrete then clay covered and certified by an engineer corp on behalf of the residents displaced  and at all cost to the rail road company. all excavation areas shall be recovered with the clay  and this area shall be provided with a concrete and iron above ground fence. the railroad shall be responsible for all residents relocation and lifetime medical services. big whoop. there may never be any litigation of this disaster in my lifetime. dam  shame that the lawyers will retain at least 50  of teh recovery. dam  shame. best to all of those in the area. this is a simple blueprint for repair  but i ain t in charge. sincerely  don
it can t possibly even be safe for bathing!!!god bless you  patriot nurse!and god bless and watch over all of those anywhere near this catastrophic damage!
i live in pittsburgh  pa  so i m upstream  but downwind.  my home is 40 miles from the accident site  so it s been in the local news right from the start  but it was days before i learned which chemicals spilled.
it s going to be extremely difficult for the residents of east palenstine and the surrounding areas to pack up and leave because their homes are literally worthless because nobody will purchase a house in that location. these poor people are in extremely dire straits.
i wouldn t be surprised if they caused this
you rock patriot nurse!
until people start dropping like flies  things will be ignored. the mm   politicians keeping a hush on everything. keep the info going
everyone in that town needs to get the hell out immediately. the chemical cocktail there is carcinogenic and deadly.  when the fish  die.  that s a rap.
not only is there a physical state change  liquid to gas for example   but a chemical change as well that is not necessarily  inert-- it s toxic. vinyl chloride  chemical asphyxiant  if i recall correctly-- like co or h2s  that when heated   burned    has a change in the physical state from a liquid to gas and a chemical change  in that gaseous state  into phosgene and hydrogen chloride. phosgene was used as a chemical additive  if i recall correctly   in wwi during  mustard gas artillery attacks! including the hydrogen chloride   i m guessing that maybe contributing to the  rashes   s sx of systemic vasculitis   being reported. not to mention the release of dioxins that are bioaccumulate  highly lipophilic  for potential chronic effects of the hepatic  immune  endocrine  dermal and mutagen reproductive dysfunctions and or failure. additionally   it is a known carcinogen!!! this is more like chernobyl  save the radionuclides en lieu of chemical toxicants. yet  destructive to human  animal and the environment nonetheless. fellow rn  from behind enemy lines  and former haz mat specialist. godspeed patriot nurse-- at least  3 !
thank you patriot nurse
patriot nurse is 100  correct !!!   her advise is what you should follow !!!
thank you!
is it possible to divert the water that is flowing into the contaminated area that could decrease the amount of contaminated water flowing out of the area.
i am a former railroader  worked on the ground when i was a brakeman conductor  supporting maintenance crews working on the railroad.  one night were out there coordinating train movements with the maintenance crews  i recall that evening they were grading the sub roadbed.  the excavator operator stopped  and said to myself and conductor that we shouldn t breath the dust from the dirt being loaded into rail cars  we asked why   he said they tested the dirt  and they found lead  arsenic and asbestos in it  were like oh that s great  we d been breathing this crap for 2.5yrs.  plus when we worked in the tunnels  it was superheated exhaust and dust from the ballast  which gave nose bleeds very easily  plus your hacking that crap up for a couple days.  we didn t work in the tunnels that much  but we were wearing flimsy masks before  and religiously after the revelation about the dirt  not much protection but better than nothing and they got rid of it before i could get a few samples from the stick pile they had.  and mind you  sometimes we d transport this stuff from one end or the other to dump  so it was being blown along the line as well.  i don t think anyone gave it much thought about protecting everyone properly.  this has been 20yrs ago  no issues  but who knows  get blood tests every six months to keep up on things  if anything does pop up  we re on our own as it would be tough to prove years later.
i am in a nursing home 50 miles north of east palestine and we had a blustery warm day. a few days ago with winds from the southeast and many of us got a burning throat and a few could smell a burning smell. also the chemicals on this train were from british petroleum!
glad i recently bought a gas mask  mira cm-7m   two 40mm filters .  got lots of water though i don t know if my filters would take out all this stuff if it happened where i live.
do you know if you can lay sand charcole rock in a wide circumference  around fruit trees would that help enough to filter chemical fall out  providing your trees are covered in time
i have the deepest compassion for these people!! i love my country and it makes me so mad that there are treasonous individuals with no care for their fellow americans.
this is so terribly sad. this evildoers will literally wait till this poor folks become part of the hills have eyes scenario. lord have mercy. i know how hard it is but in the meantime they shall go somewhere before it s to late .
perfectly put! thanks   god bless.
this disaster is catastrophic for the people  the animals that drink from those waters  birds  every living thing! this is horrible! i pray for god to give us the knowledge to find a way to fix this!
what a nightmare this is going to be for those that like in the area. to me it is worse than a tornado going through. what goes into the soil is there forever. the water in ditches  streams  rivers and ground will infiltrate where ever the water flows. someone dropped the ball on this as the train should have been stopped at the first signs of sparks on the railroad tracks. they kept the train moving and now we have a major disaster. reminds me of what happened at chernobyl. this is happening all to often around the united states.
i d say you ve nailed it 100
prayers for everyone living in that area   their loved ones all over the u.s. who are concerned about their health. don t trust the govt  - they will say water is safe  when clearly it is not. follow your gut   intuition   holy spirit
pray for the people that are affected in the area and for the people and livestock down river.
i grew up along the banks of the ohio river. we had c8 from dupont that caused untold number of cancer cases. no one said anything for years. i know big business and the government don t give a hoot about human life.
from years of bitter experience and discernment. if the government says to do something  it s best to research and consider doing the opposite!
thank you for videos . any thoughts on convention of states being able to actually do anything to right this nation  because this veteran also see s this nation getting closer to a point of no return and an actual break up of the usa. if you already did a video on convention of states please let me know  thank you. god bless
remember the experts in flint said the water was safe!praying for allof you in the fallout zone!
this will be far worse than the bp spill  this has gotten into the water shed and aquifers.  i believe the damage will last a lifetime.  a entire ecosystem will and has been destroyed.  the smoke cloud has come over new england   after a recent rain storm we had a gray deposits left on our car s! i believe this was from the ohio disaster
thank you pn !!  many blessings to you !
bless you
yes  bless you. sending you my love   prayers. that is from my heart. i m speaking your name in prayer. please know you might feel alone  but you are not. there s an entire world of people mindful of what s happening.
god be with you
boy  isn t that a terrible irony that chemicals on the train were from bp !
most filters in gas masks are not designed to filter these toxins. you d be better off with sarin nerve agent in the air. military grade mask filters can handle that. the only masks i know of that could handle this crap are the scba rigs firefighters wear. the drawback  the air tanks have to be refilled every 30-60 minutes depending on how active you are and they don t use pure oxygen  only atmospheric air. but  i don t know what effects the toxins might have on the masks and face seals.
@christophertipton2318  mira put out a notification to those who have bought their masks in response to questions being asked about the derailment.  the filters from mira are rated to protect against vinyl chloride  butyl acrylate  ethylhexyl acrylate and ethylene glycol monobutyl though not so much the isobutylene.  mira recommends the scba to deal that last one when it s in high concentrations.
that s so sad! take a family vacation  i don t think people have money to just get up and go on a vacation. may god protect all those living there. god is faithful  my prayers are with you all
i had hazmat training 40  years ago. from personal experience i can tell you that the level of training has degraded. back then  a msds was issued for every chemical specifically. now only a sds is issued with general rather than specific data.
i ve saved lot of nursing and medical assistant books including anatomy and physiology books books as well when i went further then nursing then dropped out med school when big pharma and others ruined it for me especially with regards to delivery systems of most injections and aborted baby fetal tissue. it is hard for me not h8 the government especially medical industry.
yes  pray  but there is no man-made fix for this.
thanks to international agreements  the sds has replaced the msds
redacted redacted redacted
didn t realize that.  i remember in the 1980s when workplaces had to keep a notebook of material safety data sheets  msds  for every chemical they kept on premises.  all freely accessible.  guess i m not surprised at the degradation and manipulation of info in what is now called safety data sheets.
it s the same thing  now w standardized formatting.
@barbpaq  i remember the meticulous msds system well. we were trained in the healthcare system often to understand everything. our knowledge regarding chemicals   many other possible threats  is being obscured  little by little.  in a pot    they re turning up the heat. it s time for increased awareness  prayer  discussion  sharing what we know   discernment. blessings to you   yours. stay safe.
@brianweid2836  ever seen a movie called idiocracy.
@sean robert  yes i have and we are all living it in real time.
@brianweid2836  i was trained with a lecturer and we were given hands-on exercises. since where i worked had highly toxic gases  they gave me puff modeling from the pentagon. back then  safety first  did not mean     first.
@belleofamherst  seems like it.  we need to be vigilant and we need to communicate with each other.  thank you.
don t eat anything made with this water either meaning factories that produce products near this spill area and the down water contamination areas. this guy warned about this kinda too  he said don t go back to egypt. and he said get used to not having the things for food you normally like  and fast food and etc.
r p rvn vet. 69   70. patriot nurse  i m with you. get out if you can. the government is killing it s own citizens. i ve been praying for ohio   beyond. god bless
thank you for this video patriot nurse.
did anyone investigate whether this was accidental or did someone cause this derailment  we are in a fallen world.
this is so sad  so tragic. i haven t stopped praying for them.  thank you patriot nurse.
amen sister. great video and heads up.  blessings.
i looked up dioxin and reverse osmosis it grabs some.  maybe better than nothing if you have no other option.
it s always worse than they admit  count on it!
i m in southern indiana. i cross the ohio river every day to go to work in louisville. my water does not come from the ohio river however. i m fine where i am and i do not drink the water at work. but there are cities in indiana directly on the river that will be affected.
ohio got played and it infuriates me! arent there a lot of amish in that area and have they been contacted or offered any assistance
thank you for this info.  i have a question.  i saw something on another channel that there are possibly bottled water companies in that area that may be bottling water from there but are not saying anything as to whether they will stop or not.  is there any way to find out who they are   i am in tennessee  but it concerns me that what we may buy from now on  could be coming from that area as well.  i always appreciate the hard work that you do for your audience.  thanks again!
that s what i was thinking  some sort of high-pressure distillation or tiered like you said.
thank goodness for straight talk from a very smart woman we can all trust
railways environmental teams  it s clear! safe ! clean! look our ceo even drank a glass of water!  he holds the glass  but never drinks from it.
thanks patriot nurse.  my trust is in the lord only. revelation makes it clear what will happen.
prayers for all in the area time to pack up  leave
you are right on point ! three share holders of norfolk southern are also share holders in all the major news outlets. this would explain the lack of news coverage. the clouds created contain acid. so wherever the wind takes these clouds will be affected also. acid rain will also impact down wind population.
this is a true bug out moment!
god is in control. thank you patriot nurse.
are there water testing kits we can buy to see if this stuff is in our water supply
i think nestle is one and names under nestle.
nestle  and amazons brand happy belly water is what i read from another commenter. i  don t know for a fact though!
blackrock too.. blackwater   hhmm. remember them  name change....
the ohio and penn state extension offices in each county used to do water testing. not sure if that is still the case.
their goal is to put us in a position where we can t flee a situation...  electric vehicles .   or  the only way to flee is public transportation.   buses can t move large numbers of people quickly like trains can.    yes  i know what i wrote   if radiation is involved   and a shelter is the only option   evacuees will only have the clothes on their backs.  not even a pocket knife is allowed inside.  no pets.   vehicles will be impounded outside to check for radiation.    families will be separated and given some iodine pills   maybe water.  men in one area  women in another.  not sure how they ll deal with children  but if our gooberment is involved  they could end up on an island somewhere.   the reason i know this much is because i was a volunteer for getting a building certified by f3ma in case of a nuclear plant emergency.   yes  i asked questions.  i took notes.   may god be with us.
whoever made the decision to burn these chemicals and then call it a controlled release should be fired and  jailed
praying much for the people in this area  and my heart breaks with wanting to help those who have no way or place to go too. praying.
thank you patriot nurse !
the epa said air was clean after 911. they lied just like they re lying now. move if you live there. your life is more important.  lord please protect the families that are there.
god bless you patriot nurse. i will share this.
thankyou! i m glad that somehow i am back to seeing you on youtube!  keep safe!
recall that the wind after that burn off has been a ne wind. so yes that huge mushroom toxic cloud of death has been spewed all across the land and it headed ne.
wait and see what happens to the food that comes out of this area  great example from a prepping stand point of how easy it is to destroy one s ability to survive an event.
this desperation and situation reminds me of scripture in mark 9 29   and he said unto them   this kind can come forth by nothing  but by fasting and praying.  god bless you always!
could this be intentional to ruin the central water supply for the heartland  our largest swath of land providing various needed grains etc. could also have gene modifying qualities.
get a hold of the individuals who know how to work with water as to how they change in their polarity they change their pattern harmonics when you talk to water your emotion something around that line god bless you and be safe
may he be your fortress  your tower  and your voice.
greedy railroad companies spend millions lobbying greedy politicians to cut safety regulations  and we the people are too busy trying to feed our families   so we always find out after disasters such as this!!!
thank you so much patriot nurse for your compassionate heart and soul. you are such an amazing and inspiration for us all. praying for you always. love from wisconsin.
thank you patriot nurse  by the way  pretty nails also. i don t trust anything coming from the government  nor shall i in the future !
looking gorgeous as usual! god bless you for all that you do. i m glad you are feeling better.
thank for all the research     you rock god bless you.
all of us.
those poor families  they ve got mortgages and can t sell their homes now. how do they walk away fromtheirjobs  and how would they finance a house somewhere else  what terrible choices. awful  or terrible- there are no good choices for them.
regarding the cleaning of water by boiling  couldn t a person boil water within a pressurized vessel raise the boiling point enough to allow cleaning water for human use
my immediate thought was get several of those humongous earth moving machines  the type they move mountains with. and immediately grab up all that you can of the spill put it in a sealed compartment and bury it where they bury all their toxic trash.
yep. there are 14 large food companies in that area. some of which is kraft -  which has 200 companies under them and guess who owns not only the railroad there and most of the real estate in the world but also kraft  and coca-cola in ohio has recently burned    blackrock  vanguard  and in some instances berkshire hathaway.
that s why i can no longer buy my raw milk from the farm there. it s way to close to that spill.
@pamelaxxlynne  thought you were going to say the chinese owned it which wouldn t surprise me.
the town area had lots of small farmers who sold there produce in stands. that is gone! they can t live there  they can t move. it is horrendous!
that s it they don t want you to grow ur own food.
@njprepper8601  lol  that was an implied point in my statement... but glad i m not the only one thinking it!
how can people move when no one will want to buy their houses  these people are far from rich. thanks for the follow up of this environmental disaster. nice background for video
am i imagining things or is the patriot nurse getting younger by the day  it sure looks that way to me!
my inner voice has been screaming at me for over a decade.  and yet some folks don t see it at all. i ve stopped trying to help folks. they just refuse to see.
thank you for all you do
did you hear how the city was handing out watches to put on the wrist to track their health a few days before this all happened
thank you for your research
as someone who has been trained in cbrn and hazmat  what i wanna know is whose the idiot that gave the order to stop putting water on those cars then  release the contents  then light in on fire  everyone i ve talked to everyone i know said there was absolutely no reason for it they could of kept the water on it and transferred it to other train tankers.
thank you pn for your truth and reason.
i would never be able to rest worrying about my family if i lived in this contamination zone.the side effects from anxiety alone should be considered for litigation.
ty. i m in ky. on ohio river. first i heard as i don t watch news regularly .you helped us.
i found out from an train engineer that the same train came right through my town in illinois.
thank you for informing us
thank you for always speaking the difficult truths  and ending with the most glorious truth of all.
thank you p n for your unfiltered opinion.  . love and peace
i m sorry  i must be missing something.  water boils at 212 degrees fahrenheit.  was the 173 you were mentioning in celsius
the plume reached huntington wv friday.. please talk more about water distillation of water
cognitive dissonance is a bear.
thank you patriot nurse!
thank you.  you confirmed exactly what i believed already.  if you can  leave.  i know.  that is impossible for many  but years will lapse before the full story is told.  prayers.
there are chemical filters  you can at least clean enough water to cook with  for in home use. if it neutralizes flouride  it should take care of some of these chemicals......but safe showering  household cleaning  and animal garden watering seem insurmountable...will steam distillation even leave it behind  will it travel up with evaporation
no   where did you hear this
i heard they were afraid it was going to blow up.  i don t understand why they didn t have pumper trucks spraying it to keep it cool
@monty martin  they did they were told to stop  they actually ignited it on purpose figure that one out
@mikegunner6686  doesn t make any sense
because of the higher boiling point  boiling will simply concentrate the chemicals. the water will boil away first.
i m not in ep  but i don t live far from it. its wild something so crazy happened so close.
shalom sister! very good video and information. thank you
like areas of vietnam who were hit with agent orange and suffer from birth defects and health problems today  we now have our own. like vietnam could never be cleaned up  the areas hit by the fallout plume  the water tables underneath  and some rivers are now deadly to live in. all to open the railroad sooner instead of siphoning off the chemicals from a derailment caused by maintenance reductions on railcars and tracks. tough times.
intuition should never be overlooked
p.s. don t boil water on a gas stove. or any stove. could the fumes from the water catch fire and explode
i may have missed it but is there a source that explains just how wide of an area is the ground water unsafe   10 miles from the epicenter  50 miles
the government needs to step up and help these people and clean this up.
what systems and organs will be most impacted  as for molecules  once they are in the body they are not easily removed.
did you ask the chemist if distilling the water would rid it of these chemicals
since this is not being beaten to death on main stream media you know this is a major problem. personally i believe anyone in the immediate are needs to get the hell out now. the full extent of the damage will come out later while all these residence have been exposed to this disaster.
so in the remake of the csny song  ohio   the lyrics will have to be slightly rewritten.  instead of neil young saying   four dead in ohio   with david crosby in background saying  how many more  the new lyrics will be   four million dead in ohio
thank you for posting!
what about pressure cooking or insta pot for the water  that gets hotter than boiling..  or am i completely missing a factor.... thank you for your channel i appreciate you! god bless and god s speed!
what about treating your water with activated charcoal filter  then running through something like a sawyer or berkey
just heard cincinnati just stopped taking in water from the ohio river. if nothings wrong then why is that happening
last week the epa lady was asked about testing for pfas which is a dioxin like molecule that results from these chemicals.  she said they were not testing for those.  hmmm.  if they never test and act like dioxins don t exist i guess you re  fine.  the handheld air quality meters the railroad company s testing company uses are easily manipulated to do whatever they want them to do.  in east palestine you smell all kinds of chemicals and get an instant headache  stomach ache and weird taste in mouth watery eyes and nose - but they say its fine.  i say its not fine.
chemical spill asidei think if you look at the train manifest you may find some interesting things shipped on the trainthat was being shipped. keep chasing the squirrel don t look at these cars. stand back look at the whole picturefrom start to up-to-date look at the moves made. make a list and you will start to unravelwhat and who owns unmarked cars how many times did they clear the town  who had shipments on manifest who s cars didn t get damaged  the list goes on.
they worry told the people they can move back go back home. glenn beck has done a show about that and was talking to a woman that lived within a half an hour on that same spot you might want to listen to his show about that you might even be able to give them some insights
this is closer to chernobyl than it is an oil spill.
@dee s  that makes sense. plus i m not sure if anything were to be  heated out  it would actually escape that way. this is so sad. i suppose storing water is important but it will eventually run it anyway.
what s the dilution threshold  how long will it take to dissipate
thank you for the information.  may god  bless you.
i m a retired nurse and i share your thoughts   god have mercy
is covington ky in the path of locations that needs to be vacated  it s just south of cincinnati. my daughter and her family have a very good whole house filter. is that enough  or will it do any good   i ll have to ask my husband what it s supposed to clean up.
the epa should be designating this a superfund site  however  the rr already built new tracks over the contamination.  it used to be that the polluters would pay into the superfund  but now that falls on taxpayers.
thank you patriot sister!
you forget that even if you boil the water they are still breathing the toxic chemicals
this strikes me as a chernobyl-level event..
the toxic chemicals  made their way into southern pennsylvania. they traveled northward  due to the way the winds were moving from the derailment site.
i ve been a hazardous materials manager since 1994. the response to this spill was incompetent. keep in mind that the epa considers material with 0.2ppm vinyl chloride as a hazardous waste.
can distilling the water clean it and make it safe to drink
yesterday about 5pm five envorimental agency employees flew out of clinton ar airport in route to ohio incident and crashed. all employees died on impact.
if their boiling point is higher than water....distillation of your water is an answer with very careful  temperature control...just like making shine
doesn t the river flow all the way to ms  what about all the other states along the way  hopefully they start thinking about those states as well
thank you patriot nurse ! in regard to boiling- when the chemical or contaminate   includes radiation  has a higher boiling point than water   boiling will only draw away the water and leave the contaminate in a more concentrated form.
i suppose dilution is part of the solution  rains on it long enough and wash it downstream  or does it go to the bottom and stay there  i m sort of near there   kentucky ...about three hours away.      as i understand it  those chemicals were solvents and plasticizers...      there s also combustion by products. whole lotta things to take into account here..
if i were god i think i d have given up on humans by now
a question i think a lot of people would like answered us how much around the spill what distance is or will be contaminated and for how pinch should people leave their homes
this situation is upsetting to me  so i pray   dear lord  i pray that you please help us.  no weapon formed against us shall prosper.  help your good hearted people hear in america  strengthen and raise us up because the weapons are many.  also  i pray to you  please neutralize the emitted poisons  make them as water  may no animal or human suffer from this  please lord  thwart this plan  protect us as a hen who shelters  her chicks beneathe her.  in jesus name   amen.
brandon can give billions to ukraine and illegal invaders but us citizens... our fellow americans in ohio should be paid what their operations were worth before the disaster and given money to move. prayers going up. god bless you and keep you.
prayers are okay but you must take action ohio!!
yes  nobody has asked the simple question  if the air is fine in east palistine  then where did the deadly toxic cloud that we saw go  . if you wait two weeks  like the epa did to test the air  you are pretty sure that anything that was in the air is now gone. any good lawyer should send his investigators out to all the people in the surrounding communities to see if they have noticed any affects.
the plume traveled all the way up into canada. it may have been my imagination but i swear i could smell chlorine in the air near buffalo ny a couple days after the derailment.
@johnroetzer2068  yes it was in the air in new york state for sure!
to nj as well. saw the dark black mushroom shaped cloud near pa nj border.
@njprepper8601  one us weather satellite took a photograph of the black cloud from space!
@njprepper8601  what part of the nj pa border.  philly got huge amounts of rain friday as a result of the three storm triple whammy and the delaware river is still full two days later.
distillation
how long should people leave their homes
amen
cannot agree more. stay safe everyone.
have you seen squirreltribe videos on this  she has done so much research on this. it is very interesting. you guys should talk if you don t know her. it would be interesting on what you know and what she knows.
author rosa koire -  behind the green mask   u.n. agenda 21 . you can find her lectures all over here and rumble. she wrote it and started speaking on it over a decade ago. highly recommend checking it out if you haven t already. and to the ohioans - don t sign anything! praying for all. god bless -
all should get a very experienced toxic tort lawyer so they can prepare.
as much as i d like to believe that this is a terrible accident  i don t. this was planned and carried out with malicious intent  and it s a huge success for those evil people who caused it to happen. we are now in wwiii  whether anyone likes that or not  and we re losing  most people don t even know there s a war on  don t know who s behind it  and will die without knowing. i pray to god that i m wrong  but the pattern of events around the world indicate i m right!
thank you for the info.
you said a mouthful saying  it s our responsibility  we have allowed this to happen to us. we allow our own government walk all over us. we are responsible for all of this.
pn  this wasn t a failure and it wasn t mismanaged. the whole stinking thing was orchestrated and choreographed.maranatha!maranatha!maranatha!
praying for guidance and wisdom
one of the major reasons the truth is vacant from the mainstream press  is the number one share holder in the rail line also holds shares in the top news agencies
anyone who is concerned by the toxic poisons   suggesting you get yourself a physical workup   to use as a baseline on your health   and monitor as regular as possible. there will be long term effects  cancers  skin  internal organs   not only for those in the immediate areas. that includes the animals soil food sources.
it just seems like it is now time for heads to roll.
you are 100  correct. i was born and raised along the houston ship channel. relatives worked in the petrochemical refineries. the emergency management and fire departments were not prepared for chemical fires and disasters.
the area is a cancer belt now.  at very least. liver and kidneys   lungs need protection and detox. cannot address this here  but herbs and therapeutic varieties of mushrooms and adaptogens  may help as one aspect of rehabilitation.
does anyone know if a mega home destiller will separate the mentioned chemicals from the water    it doesn t say how hot the water gets...
how coincidental is it that this happened where it did
i m wondering about residue trickling back down from the smoke...and will this contaminate the food supply
polythene glycol with potassium is what is in the antibiotic i was given that cause kidney or bladder pain!!!
isn t the idea of boiling water to kill bad living things that can hurt you   even if you could bring this chemical to a boil  doesn t mean it s leaving the water.
171 celsius   339 fahrenheit  well over the 212 fahrenheit boiling point.so boiling isn t going to work  as she says.
chaga mushroom
yes it will attack the food also
i totally agree.  i don t understand why they would even mention boiling the water.     it does nothing for the chemicals
correct you would have to distill the water with some serious equipment and even then i believe i would simply drop everything and move. as terrifying as that may be. i think staying would be even more unnerving.
telling people to boil the water will make them feel safe and keep them from kicking up a fuss.
i can imagine the damage to property value. imagine wanting to sell your home there now  with the unlikelihood you ll break even at least.
according to google i live 142 miles from this disaster. but i have railroad tracks 2 tenths of a mile from my home  not comforting. the only hospital in my county is half a mile from the same tracks.
father  grant your wisdom to the people in the danger zone  how ever far and wide it is. we ask for your devine protection. we ask for you to make a way where there doesn t seem a to be a way. move on peoples hearts to provide for those that don t have the resources to move. may the resources come in above and beyond. heal the hurting and sick. in jesus name we pray... amen
ur right  i heard from  reliable source it s the wef there doing it around world i saw the video from a young woman fr the area  the chemicals in the ohio river then down the mississippi river!it s going to travel down to the mississippi river to louisiana
trust the sciencetrust the experts they would never lie to youdrink the water  it s harmless
i find odd that this is taking place same time the asbury college revival  is taking place in ohio   . god bless  everyone thier and let no one or any entity interrupt god s almighty s works in all those that seeking him or in need help .  jesus christ is the answer!!
well pn  you might seriously  consider moving to montana when you visit for your courses that your giving later this year. maybe consider leaving now!!! prayers for you and your family in this time of heart felt confusions..
we ve seen the videos  where someone throws a rock into a creek    then some chemical is released that floats up to the surface like a film of oil. which chemical is this
who will trust officials when they say  okay you can come back home now  we have it allll cleaned up!!! lol! i heard that the epa threatened norfolk southern and said if the epa has to clean this up they will charge norfolk southern triple the cost  if they can t force them to clean this up  how on earth is the epa going to get money out of norfolk southern  taxpayer money!
listen to your gut instinct like she said! every time i don t  i get sucker punched with brass knuckles  or something else happens lol  for real  though!
curious as to where those chemicals were going and what were they going to be used for
thank you i forwarded this to my people in southern ontario
activated charcoal is the best way to filter and clean the water.  let people know!!!
you are very right.  it is time to move and find a new place to locate your family.
the epa is going to have about as much credibility as the cdc...if the epa was higher than the cdc even before this ohio tragedy. back in the 90 s california  with support of many  green  groups   had the brilliant idea to add mtbe to gasoline to lower air pollution  this was before ethanol . the mtbe started to eat its way through underground gasoline tanks and contaminate the ground water table  which it did with speedy efficiency  in many communities.  these days california government  and associated  green  groups  act like they are the only solution to the problem created by  overreaching and failed to study the downsides  government  that still impacts the state to this day!
thank you patriot nurse.
my brother s friend has family and friends that live 30 miles from the train and him and a couple of his neighbors have had to go get checked and they were told that they had heart problems.  they were shut down when asked if it was related.
god bless you and thank you !!!!
david dubyne has a great video out on rumble talking about this. i highly recommend that everyone watch it.
this is biowarfare without accountability if this was done on purpose ive heard of 2 other derailments as well what is going on here calling it an accident exempts them from accountability  this needs to stop whats next
hah! you first!
@btoth7146  hoping he meant that sarcasticly . surely.
@jamesh.maloyjr.6940  duh
cience.
@jamesh.maloyjr.6940
thank you patriot nurse!
you ll know how bad it s in a few years when cancer clusters show up
great points sister  there should be independent   of the fed s   evidence collectors and attorneys ready to rumble
to musabe009 thank you for your service.may god keep you humbled in prayer for our usa. may we all draw near to himduring this time in our history.god give us your strength  to trust you .
bg and buffet are big owners in the rr. along with black rock vanguard statesreet black stone. also bg own about 9k acres  i  believe within 100 miles .
my son works with this stuff.  it highly toxic one of the worse things they work with
while it is safe to do so  i am filling every container  jar  thermos i have with tap water  and setting them up to be filtered thru my alexa pure.
i hope you feel better i can tell something wrong i can healu
no info from mainstream.  i will share this video with everyone i know. thank you for clear  concise words.
i truly appreciate your research. astute and circumspect godly presentations. sister..  oh my. yur in kentucky
boiling would actually make the chemicals more concentrated.
can you filter with charcoal and sand
all reports...such that they are since the event is nearly quashed in the national media complex...are indicating that this is a  chornobyl-level  environmental event.  i realize that is very hyperbolic  but it appears to be an accurate description.
this hasn t been the only derailment in the country in recent weeks.
god bless all the people and animals in the path of this disaster.
unfortunately   money won t mean anything if there is no place to go that is uncontaminated....
but dupont said   better living thru chemistry!   sarc off
i can tell everyone one thing!  when the ceo and coo decided to allow explosives being used when there was no need means murder period!
tons of these chemicals went up into the atmosphere and are coming down in the great lakes watershed and on the snow. they were picked up in the rain in hamburg ny!!!! this is far more widespread than you are indicating.
silent weapons for quiet wars!  the club of rome plans to accelerate environmental destruction to achieve their global dominance goals and wrote about this sinister plan decades ago.
problem being  from what i ve heard is  most there don t have the financial resources to just leave. when you have plenty of money leaving is easy.
i have enjoyed your videos and hearing about your good work for years.  i m sorry for the hardships you have faced in your life.  thank you for your efforts  and keep up the meaningful content!
if the water is contaminated then this will go well beyond ohio. those waterways all meet at the mississippi which flows into the gulf. i would not be eating anymore gulf shrimp. or much of any seafood for that matter.
while i agree this is horrible  i still remember when bp dumped billions of gallons of oil into the gulf and i thought it was the end of the world. interestingly a naturally occurring bacteria virtually erased the damage that was caused and actually triggered a lot of new coral and ocean life to spawn in the area. sometimes thing have a way of working out  maybe a higher power was involved  if i lived in e palestine i would move just to be safe. time will tell!
i will be in new castles  pa next week for work  15 miles away. i will bring my own bottled water  but i will be staying in a hotel. do you think it s safe to take a shower at a hotel that s on a city water hookup
an all american pressure canner does exceed 171 degrees. what if you pressure cook water supply
if anyone who could possibly read this who is from that area... if you have nowhere to go  you can come here. i cannot imagine having to pick up and move from my home  but if money or a place to go to is the problem  come here.
it s going to be a major spill.  i was a haz-mat instructor for several years.
i ve heard the entire town of palestine had  enrolled  in a digital medical monitoring program shortly before the derailment
may god be with us all and mercy.
so how far is this going to spread  and how do we actually know our water is safe.  i m 40 miles away in pennsylvania.  they are telling us nothing!!! absolutely nothing!! no one is concerned about pennsylvania water.
171c   340f. boiling point of water   212fso there s that.
we are about 3 hours away from new palestine ohio i wonder how bad we are going to be effected we have had nausea and headaches for days.we have no way to leave no money till we sell our home amongst other issues.wow
so thankful you really  are so helpful. praying for you to keep voicing the truth.
what about buying manufactured goods from the grocery store from those areas around there  like sodas and food. i guess we should start watching what we buy.
does anyone know what type of water filter could clean water to make water drinkable  burkey  etc
awesome reporting and god and listen ing to your spirit thank you my sistet i need to hear this god bless
god help us all
thank you!!! god bless!!
for years we had warnings on eating fish because of  pcb s    now this is in our waterways. god help us all.
two words  love canal.
zero water  filters should work imo.
amen!
chemical safety data sheets and emergency response guidebook are a necessity. app or book.
it s all about depop.    the miles and miles of rails can not be monitored.
these people in charge of everything need to be locked up for the rest of their lives.
please don t bathe in your water either  your skin will absorb everything placed on it. pn  you are a godsend!
water boils at 100c at sea level.  if this chemical doesn t boil until 170c  it is a good candidate for distillation.
basically  boiling kills bacteria  not chemicals. thats what i always thought.
also intel corp is building a chip plant there that will require a lot of water.
anyone that has a shallow well and draws water from it for the their home  or shallow wells more commonly used for livestock will be infected depending on wether or not these chemicals have penetrated into the soil  and have seeped into the ground water!  i don t think any deep well water will be infected  but that will depend on what the professionals in that field have to say! i hope that norfolk railroad is removing all the contaminated soil from the disaster area!
i wouldn t even want to shower in that water. leaving is the best option and hopefully you will all be compensated.
thank-you for getting the information out there  you and the chemist are correct.  that area of ohio is done for a long time to come.
random thought... is this what the bible talks about when the water turns bitter ! it really makes u wonder how long it could would take to spread throughout the world
let s face it.  the ohio river will merge into the mississippi. .. .  a major part of the country is going to be impacted by this event.  and it s not going to be easy  pleasant  or fast-resolved.
i live in sw pennsylvania and get my water from the yough river. indian creek watershed. i have to wonder if my source is polluted out of this nightmare .
prayer is so needed now. i describe what is happening to our country like this  it was a beautiful painting  but the paint is running down the canvas. satan is killing  stealing  and destroying. holy spirit must guide our decisions.
did anyone see the big fire  in bedford ohio just today huge industrial fire now . what the heck is going on   not to mention a big police presence on the roads near me in ohio this weekend..
the chemicals have already made it to the east coast. they re getting chlorinated rain. it s reached canada too  it s in their snow!
when he led the out  he brought them out healthy psalm 105 37 he brought them forth also with silver and gold  and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
i am glad to see the revival happening at asbury and other places. we need god badly.
anyone notice how they all knew not to show up  not to say a word  planned!
they getting poison...
it s not chlorinated rain. it s phosgene  dioxin  agent orange  hydrochloric acid.
@njprepper8601  the phosgene continues to roll out from the site. it s too late for most of us
@njprepper8601  well it smells like chlorine.
@njprepper8601  right on
not everywhere on the east coast
@kdavis4910  u will find out
@kdavis4910  new york
have you lived in this area   apparently not.  this is a drop in the bucket to what goes on here daily. the ohio river valley is chemical alley.  most of that stuff is made here and spills everyday.  plant upsets strip the paint off of workers cars.  the is the only the plant in the world that still makes the stuff that destroyed bhopal india is right in charleston  wv.  one of only two teflon plants in the world  deadly poisonous   is in washington  wv.   teenage cancer rates are already through the roof.  this is just an extra bad day in a hundred years of spills.
louisville water blocked me for asking when the plume will get here and why they won t shut down intake valves like cincy. water is sold out here because no one trusts them. i need to know when to switch to bottled water already have filtered water and showers  and when to stop laundry  etc.. they refuse to tell us while cincy gives constant updates.
they ll condemn the land and claim it under existing power. the residents in the pathway will lose their farms and homesteads.
agreed sister pn pick up your bible and read  matthew 24  luke 21  and mark 13 not to forget revelation and pray unceasingly.
i agree this is a massive issue  but i don t see the cause as anything but 5th gen warfare.  this is a purposeful attack.  what happens to the farmers that use the ohio for irrigation   what happens to the natural resources of that area that have been used to sustain life   what of the bees   will they be present to pollinate  and will they endure plants that have been watered with contaminated water
my question is what chemicals weren t mentioned
ethanol glycol is in almost every product we use.  its in pharmaceuticals  sunscreens  cosmetics  inks  dyes and water-based paints but can be avoided if you read your labels.  from the vape smokers to the lotion and shampoos many foods. yes this is dangerous. but we have been exposed to this  over a number of years.  and is it not water soluble
everyone mentions ky what about wv  they also had a diesel spill in the new river which runs into the kanawha which runs into the ohio.
great video patriotic nurse ..i live in indiana about 3 hours away over the weekend i walked my dog in the rain and now he s having breathing problems and is sick. they with the chemtrails they spray and the harp causing it to rain these chemicals like you said are so small that it s getting into the air getting into the water the rain the ground anybody on the ohio river anyone that gets drinking water from the ohio river like you said it s not safe my aunt and uncle lives an hour and a half away from this right on the ohio river in ohio across from west virginia my other family live in west virginia and they re right on the ohio river which they get their drinking water from the ohio river. this disaster not only affects that small-town it affects kentucky indiana ohio west virginia pennsylvania illinois in missouri any state that has the ohio river that s using that as a water source is in deep jeopardy. not only ohio is 80  of the midwest water bottled water and food sources of meat and grains etc so in the next few months if we don t stock up on food now we are not going to have safe food. it s affecting the whole midwest and it s very scary. thanks for this video god bless everyone leave it to jesus pray and do what you can to protect your family
class action lawsuit   compensation for relocation to a different area for everyone
so then this is a case for distillation at a controlled temp below the boiling point of the chemical agents
is berkey water filters able to filter out vinyl chloride.  i can t find anything in the cdc  new  pdf  that was released 11 days prior to the spull.
many of these chemicals are immediately deadly  eventually cancerous and corrosive.  contamination would make any food production item  unfit for use for human or animal consumption.  filtering chemicals from water is possible  but still risky  because filters always miss some particulates and as the filter ages or the more is passed through it  the more the amount of particulates slip through.  what sucks  is that in time  these contaminates will eventually make their way into well water.this chemicals release may have a very long term negative impact upon the environment and the life forms that depend on it.fukushima and chernobyl are still poisoning the environment to this day.
this will effect a 3rd of the country water table remember they pretty much took out the food system
i live in the adjoining county  trumbull  north. east palestine in columbia. i personally know people in my area who grew up there and still have family there. it has been emotionally and mentally draining for them...
the railroad or the federal government needs to pay these people what their homes were worth before this happened to give them a way to get out of this toxic environment so they can buy a house somewhere else  because their homes are worth nothing now. but  i won t hold my breath.
what about distilling the water  while that wouldn t work on a large scale  maybe it could work for drinking water.  water boils at 100 degrees c  this crap boils at 175 degrees c. so i would think you could distill the water off  catch that and use it.
thank you patriot nurse.
beloved  patriot nurse   will you please host a prayer vigil.  we need more than one to come in prayer right now
must take nac and vitamin c for antioxidants and healing  milk and activated charcoal for detox.
good question.
the people in east palestine oh are relatively poor. i hope someone is somehow able to get this video out to them large scale. i would have been out day 1. saw a video this morning. a woman in wisconsin  made a snowball from the snow that had fallen. put it under a flame. it did not melt  only blackened. woman said it smelled of chemicals and had plastic in it. you be the judge. i m using the same commonsense that steered me away from the v-x from day 1. good job  patriot nurse. appreciate your great research and all you do!  erin brockovich  all over again.
amen.
love ya young lady
good work.
don t blame the government. blame the greedy corporations.
all they had to do was read the data sheet and the would not have burned it
lord i pray for discernment for all people effective by this horrific disaster!!!
we need a massive fund raiser for the families so they can move
if i didn t have patriot nurse to listen to  i would feel alone
did any of this get in the ohio river  or any creeks or streams that connect to the ohio river    all life down stream from the disaster site will be infected!
ro water and add minerals back in or distilled and add minerals back in.
remember that every disaster movie begins with a government guy in a white coat saying there s nothing to worry about...
wasn t mtbe the stuff the epa mandated as an additive to motor fuel to control exhaust emissions in the 1990s  it caused all kinds of health problems until they could no longer hide it.
people need to use nature to clean it up.  concentrations are going to be a factor for sure.  mycoremediation  mushrooms  and phytoremediation  plants particularly hemp  will be lest toxic than what the epa will propose to clean the environement.  i pray god will open the eyes and ears of those residents of east palestine to pursue solutions for their highest and best good.  this doesn t have to be decades long catastrophe  we are creators of our reality if we choose to claim it.  blessings!
boiling point is based upon atmospheric pressure boiling point. celsius 99.97 degrees   fahrenheit 211.95 degrees is the normal atmospheric pressure. it depends on sea level pressures. the higher you are the less atmosphere pressure there is. humidity also alters things too. it s all the laws of physics when diving or flying. every 33 ft diving changes 1 atmosphere and flying is 1 000 ft. there are a lot of factors most don t realize. think of making certain candy  like divinity. if there s rain and a lot of moisture it will not set. the humidity is too high. there is not one standard  it varies based on conditions.
what about bathing in this water   it s my understanding that netflix s had a show on this exact thing and in the same town . was this planned by our government   just asking
as a starter  the legislators seem to be negligent here in allowing such a long train laden with excessively high of volume of toxic chemicals to be crossing the state. government seems to be overly concerned with co2 and negligently unconcerned about toxic  cancer causing chemicals being drug through residential areas. let the legislators get out there in hazmat suits and clean it up.
cdc changed its policy on vinyl chloride protocol 11 days before disaster!
be aware that there is a possibility that benzene may also be involved as an over-looked additive to the other known chemicals    has different hazardous properties.  stay alert to that possibility as more info come out!
praise god for you !!!
yes it ended up polluting all kinds of groundwater.
might be a good time to decide who is friend or foe
it s got benzene in the soil and water too.
norfolk southern should pay for relocation of all of those people who want to move right now   in addition to whatever financial settlement is finally arrived upon. not everyone has the means to just pick up and move.
i m in massachusetts and we are scared!!! will a water filter straw take it out of the water
this ohio chemical spill will be much much larger than the bp oil spill
only thing i can add is the hazmat comments are correct below.to put what she said into perspective 171c is 339.8  fahrenheit.  water boils at 100c which is 212 f  at sea level . boiling water never gets to even 250f!
approximately  50 miles from the spill are the amish farms.  they have been attacking the amish farms in pa and are shutting them down.
my advise is to buy a rv if you can and go on a extended vacation for a few months.. then reassess the situation
halley burton now commands a fracking paradise. ohio has several hundred fracking sites. farmer s class action suits. no people  fracking paradise.
are reverse osmosis systems effective in removing these chemicals
as a lt in the fire service  i would like to know who is making the decisions in the hazmat call. seems like they are hoping that mother nature takes it all away. it s a massive incident. whatever is  there is off gassing and will off gas for a very long time. our bodies are filters and will plug up.  the hot zone is the scene  no one is allowed in unless they are fully encapsulated.  fire departments do not have all the equipment and personnel needed to mitigate this. vinyl chloride is highly flammable. hope for all.
i feel i should pass on some of the years of small scale personal research and testing i have been doing for 30  years on drinking water and safety.electrolysis combined with filtering through natural activated chaorcoal is able the remove most of the 9000  pfas chemicals.unfortunately there is  as far as i have found  no way to remove enough of these man made chemicals from the water to make any water anywhere in america truly safe for consumption  not even rain water!
boiling point of water is 100  c or 212  f
this is not restricted to ohio. these molecules are going up in the atmosphere and raining down alllllll around the world. who didn t learn that in first grade  this will not go away!
you always look awesome!!   thank you
when..... when..... have they been honest with us..... never. we know that.
you ve done a great job in your reporting. thank you.
if the whackos believe that it is safe  simply prove it and rent and actually live in the numerous vacant homes.
don t worry about it. little pete is riding his bicycle. he ll be there soon!
and this is just horrifying. it will be the death of many people. and the aquatic life is done.
will a berkey filter work to make the water safe
wouldn t boiling increase the concentration in the water then  just wondering.
no water  nothing growing from surrounding area.  anyone in this country living near an active railroad should be ready.  this destruction feels intentional.
so are you saying a water filter such as a berkey or a distilling water filter will not work on this
left leaning media are certainly reporting how dire this is. not sure which outlets give you the impression that they aren t  it is surprising to me to see right leaning media reporting on how dire this is instead of distracting from environmental damage for the benefit of corporations and investors.
we re here from the government  and we re here to help.
the governor calling the dod to get advice on what to do  rather than the epa and that is where instructions to blow the cars came from. all but one of them were fine. one was leaking. the others presented no threat at all. and what did they do  they placed explosives on the ones that could simply be put back on the tracks and blew them up. even if they could not be put back on the tracks  they could have been offloaded onto trucks. the one that was leaking could have been offloaded too  with the ground around it needing cleanup. whoever decided to blow it up and create a chemical weather system needs to go directly to jail.  - jim stone  freelance journalist
this is chernobyl on a much more massive scale. these people and all those east and south-east of the spill are screwed. hopefully this spreads all the way to washington dc and then maybe someone will care. otherwise  they will ignore it.
seems a huge steel plant near  40 miles east  of this disaster area has had a huge explosion and fire yesterday. again huge amounts of chemicals in the air  huge black plumes of smoke and again... in ohio.
berkeys website says the filter removes vocs including chloride vinyl
how about the rest of the state  the jet stream takes most of the cloud to the east but is the air bad everywhere
good work my friend
a berkey filter will filter out some of the dioxin but not all of it.
due to the tenacity of dioxins  i doubt that any filter will work. i wonder if the condensate from a dehumidifier would be safe.
@paulhare662 probably not.
i m confused the boiling point for water is 212 so i m not sure your statement at the beginning is accurate if the compound evaporates or dissipates at 177 that boiling water is indeed high enough to remove it
it s like chernobyl only chemicals
it can t  be good when the wild life is dying and the government says it is safe you can t  believe  anything the government says people need to use common  sense and think for themselves this can t  be good . stay safe god bless.  prayers for them .
isn t boiling point 212 degrees f
how far reaching would you not touch or drink the water  what about the underground aquifers in the area  where do they extend  i see so much conflicting into
what if they pressure canned the water
i so agree!  we must not fear but trust yhwh!!  he is our strength and our shield!  this is his judgment
every person in that area who wants to relocate  should be compensated by the government to do so.  their properties bought for a fair price.  get the children out of there.   so much money wasted on other things  they need to help their citizens.  this is sickening.
who are the governor and politicians of that area
there was also one in warren pa yesterday
@valkyrie5948  a boiler exploded in warren  oh. i felt it 15 miles away.
and now there s a metal plant that exploded in bedford oh like 2 hours ago....
be safe people. stay close to god in prayer if you want his protection.
but your filters becomes contaminated with no method to clean them.
fl. has had 2 chemical incidents and one is still burning for like the 7-8 day. prayers for all of you
thank you dear sister. i look forward to bible study with you. i want to know how the new covenant cleaves to the old covenant. i want to know how we are all made one through jesus i want to know. i look forward to bible study with you. shalom always.
....   if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them   mark 16 17 18. believe y all... it s coming to the point we will learn to trust god for everything.
if they have a badge asume they lie most the time
unfortunately  up and moving is exactly the intended result. people sell cheap to get out and billionaires buy up the farmland super cheap. eventually we will all be in high rises  while they own all the farms. and therefore  all the food.
if we can t neutralize the chemicals  then how long before they dissipate
some people compare this to chernobyl..... i go more domestically  like 3 mile island and love canal  it pays to be older and remember such things . very sad to see this disaster! does anyone hear about any of the chemicals spreading to other states like pa and wv
amen
to all people of faith  please convene an emergency meeting at your church temple  synagogue  mosque  house of worship.there are thousands of ohio   pennsylvania families in harm s way who do not have the money to suddenly relocate hundreds of miles away. in cooperation with your fellow worshippers  please come together to sponsor the needs of one or more ohio or pennsylvania families to help them get resettled in your community. this incident in ohio- and the way it was handled - are a grievous and malevolent assault upon the human person  god s perfect creation made in the creator s image.the government has abandoned these people and deliberately chosen to do nothing. it falls to us - people of faith - to step forward and to rise to the occasion. please speak with members of your houses of worship about this urgent need as soon as possible.
aquagwar .. radioactive filter . will this take out the butyl acrylate
the list of chemicals that are spilled are one facet. what is the fallout or new  chemicals formed by mixing and burning together.  there is no way to know what was created in the mixture and heating of the new solution
if boiling the water is not going to work  get out as soon as you can!
you are so right on  patriot nurse!  don tdepend on the evil govt politicians to take care of you and your family... god willlead if you will listen! blessings to you!
kentucky bourbon will never be the same again.
the blowing up of the nordstream pipelines caused a massive environmental disaster. this act of war was perpetrated by the us and norway according to the research done by investigative journalist seymour hersh.
how do you force government to take responsibility they all scratch each others back.
we need a revival in america and the world. in a way  it s amusing that those trying to kill us are bringing us closer to god and reinforcing our relationship with god. god bless every one.
roy potter said that vinyl chloride was used as an agent in ww1 i assume against the soldiers
did your chemist buddy give any idea of what radius around ground zero should be cautious   i swear to you i ve been having various exposure symptoms since before i even heard about this disaster  but i m 60 miles away and everyone i know here thinks it s too far away   that i m being silly
what baffles me is how is it legal to transport such chemicals on a railroad that is so close to a waterway  seems like something of that size and magnitude would have been routed further away from such a water source.
you re not being silly at all. i have no other advice except to monitor symptoms and detox as much as possible with bottled water and healthy lifestyle.
you are not being silly june. i am in nj and i have felt burning in the lungs. i am on border of pa nj.
june  i heard from a youtube prepper that this could affect up 1000 miles from the spill site.  unable to verify this though
june  i am 50 miles away and have not felt well. you are not silly.
@fyvejeekilz801  when it is in waterways and air it will go with the flow .. is there a safe zone !!
do the opposite of what the abcs tell you to do
well  what more of an example of federal government incompetence and unconcern do you need   be prepared and may the good god bless you pn!
what about water distillation for homeowners  can that possibly remove chemical contaminants  i know it won t help the massive effect on the environment  but maybe it can mitigate the health effects for the people who live downstream. try not to worry. god is all-knowing. he has seen this coming before it happened  and we will find the solution that he has provided for us. keeping palestine  oh in my prayers.
could you please get a mic love you and your content!!
thank you for bring us this info. you delivered very well.
how many microns is the molecules. what about distillation. if temps needed above boiling will the gas off still go into the steam. reverse osmosis goes down to 3 microns.
testing will begin in new zealand and australia this week and will roll out to other countries soon  he said. for  11.99 per month on the web or  14.99 per month on apple and android operating systems  meta will use a government identification to verify a user s account.
thank you courageous woman are you god bless you
i pray to abba in yahshua  s name to cover with his precious blood all people  animals and natural resources in this affected area....and many miracles in healing the land  animals and people be done.amen.
what about canning the water
thank you for sharing patriot nurse.  we are praying for those people in ohio.  we were moving to kentucky this summer..... maybe not now. we ll see.
what are we really looking at here  how many farmers  both livestock and agriculture  are effected  how far does that meat vegetables ship across the country  is rain water safe for these people  i m encouraging everyone to do their own research on these things. it may not just be localized come spring.
i don t think these people have the money for a  vacation.  secondly  how can they vacation and truly relax knowing that their town  houses  land  crops  water  soil  animals  air  etc. has been completely desecrated by the multiple chemicals that have changed the ecology forever. these people lost everything. they risk losing their health too  if they stay. what about the animals  pets and all other wildlife that have already died. this definitely goes deeper than the train company s negligence. this was a planned governmental disaster  just like covid  as evidenced by the predictive programming movie white noise. i will keep on praying that god blesses all of those people harmed  bringing them justice and given substantial compensation.
horrible situation. but  they  will continue to make it look little.
make everyone responsible including biden to drink a big ol glass of that water...
erin brockovich showed up in town. we know she s on the people s side and you know it s bad!
thoughts and prayers for them
wh should be forced to source their produce and meat from the areas affected  bottle that water and have the epa sipping on it if it s safe. whole situation reminds me of when obama mocked flint by drinking the glass of water while he stood by and did nothing to help an american city get potable water again.
friend works in water testing and he was pretty worried about it and said the only way to filter out this stuff is with a reverse osmosis system.
bottled water only for anyone in ohio and kentucky then and just make sure the water in the bottles comes from somewhere else..
we are living in a day where you better find god and be at peace with him
and.. don t believe this is an accident. not even for a moment.
i can t imagine how many lives your saving by providing this valuable informationgod bless you and your family pn
people will be opening their homes to others if they re true disciples of christ
ethylene glycol is automotive antifreeze and at 100  strength will not boil till to   260  fahrenheit
would reverse osmosis get it out
norfolk southern did a cost benefit analysis and decided 5  more accident payouts would cost less than upgrading their trains. so they went with more profit and less safety.  capitalism baby!
thx for the info!
residue from the airborne chemicals have already drifted across the border into southern ontario. traces have been noted on the surface of rivers and in snowmelt.
pn  i  can tell from your voice and demeanor you are terribly concerned about this situation   perhaps more so than you are letting on. in no way do i think you mean to deceive us. perhaps it is your disappointment and anger at  government incompetence shining through.  thank you for all you do.
so... what do the chemicals do to people and is it temporary  what land area are we talking about  how far from the river  how long of a vacation  is this just a call to do our own research  like you have done  when you say there s no way to filter it that is safe for marine life then is it possible that our drinking water facilities are able to filter it out because they don t have to deal with marine life
it s so easy to say get out.   many of us can t get out.  we have no place to go.  we have no     to get there.
i love the optimism concerning god s watching over his people.even when nebuchadnezzar  herod  pharaoh  hitler  stalin  pol pot  mao  etc. were doing atrocious things  god was still in charge. despite millions dying at the hands of the psychopathic lunatics listed above  god is still in charge. as a nation that has forsaken god by what we tolerate in our society  we deserve his justice.history doesn t teach us that we escape. it might help us to endure if we learn from it and respond accordingly with action.
if this agent was used in ww1 we have the data just have to find it.
nowadays i just start with the assumption that they are lying  and go from there.
wait  you mentioned  6.47  this was a result of capitalism  actually that s not true  it s based on greed and that can exist in any system  even socialism.
amen.god will clean house.our lady asked for sacrifice and prayerour lady of fatima pray for us
thanks  pn!
boiling water is not going to remove these toxic chemicals. bacteria yes  toxic chemicals no.  and the waters became bitter and people died from drinking the bitter waters  a third part of the waters to be exact. read it folks. we are there now. revelation 8. hosea 4 3  therefore shall the land mourn  and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish  with the beasts of the field  and with the fowls of heaven  yea  the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.   wishing it away won t make it go away.
i was warned.  watch the water .
thank you patriot nurse!  may god bless and keep you as you consistently sound the alarm!  listening from indianapolis
follow the money. i don t have any information   but we must look at who would gain from this  accident . praying for all those in the area. biden keeps sending billions to ukraine  yet could make all the residents in east palestine whole instead.
the way i see it and feel is  america is not mentioned in revelation. therefore  america is destroyed and this is all part of it. if you haven t already  repent and accept jesus our lord and savior. i focus on him more than anything these days. i rather have eternal life with him and my righteous brothers and sisters. no fear. we are protected by the blood of the lamb. you just have to believe! much love and may god be with you.
time for these people to  bug out
there s that beautiful woman again
the older i get the more i hate government  from local  to state   federal i can t stand government employees  they are the worst.
always an outstanding video and presentation.
i understand it was very hard for you to make this video due to your hatred for palestine  but you set it aside and did it. i m proud of you.
jesus bless you with his holy spirit
there is word spreading this could be a false flag.  local people are doing ok  if it s so toxic  how is this possible   shouldn t hospitals be packed  vet clinics  wildlife rehabs  etc   there are things going on in ohio that shed light on the situation.
are you saying that it ll be as bad  on the environment  as the bp spill  i would think that since that  spill  affected the animal life more than human life. so essentially this is way worse than that spill as this affects both animal and human. these folks deserve a huge monetary compensation.  could you use a pressure canner to boil the water  with the vents closed the internal temperature reaches 240-250 degrees. just a thought.
i just heard another derailment there but don t know if it s true
i heard that black rock and vanguard own the rail company that had the spill. if that s the case  it tells you why they are downplaying it.
i love you  patriot nurse  but  failure and mismanagement  by gov t institutions regarding this disaster is not only woefully understated  it s not even correct. it wasn t  mismanagement.  that denotes that ones simply made a mistake  like it was an accident. this was neither a mistake nor accidental. this was intentional. all of the evidence points in that direction. you must regroup in your assessment.
he  god  will not leave us nor forsake us  but he will let us go through some very serious pain and suffering. so regardless of how prepared you are   and you should be  it does not mean that the hard times coming  will not leave it s devastation on you and millions of others  nor will the people of ohio  not suffer some serious perils. the  american dream  is not biblical. the only assurance that you can have is that once you leave this fallen world is that you can live enterally with him.i fear our country is gone and done. but our future home is ready and eternal depending on your response to what christ did on the cross. the  harvest  may be now. time is short  even if you live to be a hundred . blessings and peace to you all.
i live 36 miles away  not downwind thankfully  feel like we have been nuked.
i sincerely believe that we are in the end of the age. believers know what i mean. non-believers  god bless and speak to you. without faith i d be incapacitated at this point . there is no secular win. it s not that we can t find it. it isn t there. deuteronomy 28  all of it 2 thessalonians 2 8-13
all of these train derailments are 100  intentional. it is no accident the cargo they are carrying.
these people...nothing will happen to them  they will not be held accountable for ruining peoples lives.
buy something far away  then short sell or walk away from your ohio place. take the hit of bad credit and have your health. start over but live a long life.
downplaying it or controlling it   if you want all the people off the land driving a load of chemicals into the area and releasing them might be something you would be prepared to do.  you calculate some will move away  the rest will die.  et voila!  the contaminated land falls nicely into your hands.  might cost a few million in compo to the few survivors but that would beca small price to sc um like that.
@equisader  you re right  these companies have money to burn. clean up and compensating some families is a drop in the bucket to them.
agree. and any lawsuits they have so many lawyers that will keep in the courts forever and the people will never see a penny for having their home and lives turned upside down
maybe not in this live time but you don t get pass god s judgment
@beverlymichael5830  it s so sad what has become the norm.
@brendawhitehouse980  really evil people out there  greed is always at the root of things.
they sent in their own people to do the inspection.
two-tiered justice   system
genie is out of the bottle  once you ve been exposed you been exposed.
there are lots of water testing labs available to everyone.  when you see these polluted waterways  snow  rain  etc.  collect samples!  get them tested.  we need to use the tech at our disposal
just an interesting blurb i just heard saw  we are change yt channel  today s video feb 19th titled  uprising! this could be it for canada   showed photos from ontario  i think it was  with caption saying to the effect  they d never seen snow melt with rainbow iridescent sheen . wow !  it s in the snowfall over canada even !     your video is so important to those affected.  i pray the folks most affected get word of your video.  i love your advice to follow your intuition first.  you ve got real heart !  my eyes are tearing up over your bravery and caring.  if everyone was like you  we d have a wonderful society.  many blessings and much love  thank you.
the ohio chemical spill is a  s.h.t.f.   event for sure.
yeah  this was another act of war. they keep giving us warnings in movies to see how much we will acquiesce. i ll give you 3 examples 1  in the movie  knowing  the news reported a major oil spill in the gulf of mexico. with in a year  it really happened. when the deep water horizon exploded.2  then  6 months before 911  an episode of  lone gunman  showed were a hi-jacked plane was targeting the towers. then it really happened3  last year  in the movie  white nosie  this train wreck happen in that town   once again it happened within about a year.
i was a firefighter emt with other train derailment  first thing they wanted to do was to exploit then the governor came in and stopped it. it takes years before we new the towns was going to be good or not. i slept for 6days in a parking lot on ground . please think on what you are doing is safe first.
i feel bad that i didn t find out about the situation until after i had already moved here. i just recently moved to cincinnati.
yes prayers for everyone having to go through this
folks.....when the government tells you water is ok.remember what they say  we are here to help .come on man! don t believe them..
we live in north central pa. we got the fall out. the wind brought the fall out. the sky was all rainbow. then it rained the next day. right into the soil and water table. just heard chicago got burn going as does kissimmee  fl. wake up people we are almost done.
mycoremediation   using fungi to clean environmental toxins  might be a way. paul stamets has a book on this i think.
been hearing alot about power outages lately.. can t imagine it not happening at this point.. so prepare for darkness..
if i remember my organic chemistry those are aromatics and they are quite dangerous to living things and definitely cause cancer.
living in s w ohio  we ve  been preparing for it  thank goodness we got alot of rainfall and the river is high  they closed off the water intakes a few days ago  but the lasting impact  this will go on for a decade or more.
i m truly interested in knowing who is testing  n are they actually a trustworthy source  the reaction to said disaster leads me to lean towards a  red herring  event. no doubt something was released  but there are many household products that can cause such issues in excess. is this a land grab disguised as a disaster
that train should have never even left the yard. if we could only be more pro active and take some action against these atrocities against our land. better not to trust this evil government with our lives. be aware people and god bless. thank you pn your on it again for the solution. god bless
my thought in the course of all this  is that a direct terrorist attack means retaliation  but if you attack stealthily attack a country with a a failing infrastructure and systemic incompetience  it is easy to hide who is to blame.
god bless you patriot nurse!!
these people are evil. god bless all of us.wwg1wga
ty  im within the 200 miles radious of this spill.  cincinnatti has closed down their  water intake  i heard from a utoober.  civilian videos  pics  everything is being kept silent.  i heard mention this spill could affect up to 1000 miles.  ty patriotnurse!
i also live in that area  and i don t trust what they re saying.
yes   white rot fungus is helpful
i know i m in highland county
i m also in your area  and i really don t believe what they say. i think it s a lot worse and they lie.
@vm-123  that s all they do is lie
they sent their own people to do the inspection
i m hanging out still before i get to that conclusion. this same location was a  protocol  beta test for the e-id a few years back. interesting the amount of individuals who participated  n the theory is their all in on it as actors  work for black rock  n got paid for their  skills
that collection of letters at the end is representative of what witches chant. you probably don t know.
@jeffnorbert1871  - what do the letters stand for  wwg1wga
@msmuffetstuffet  where we go one we go all. it s something the people who followed q say. i don t know about witches chanting.
yes they closed the intakes down at 2 00 a.m. this morning. supposedly going to wait until it bobbles on by. i foresee them saying oh we can t open the intakes  and now we are running out of fresh water. now we have to ration and turn yours off certain hours of the day.
isn t 2 weeks after the fact a little late to be doing this
distill!!!! i don t know why people give the blanket statement  filter your water . you have to know what things your filter takes out. they are not all the same.  in addition  you have to know what chemicals are in your water.  the two have to match. distillation takes it all out.
i had a terrible dream.. an eco-disaster and a digital monitoring system to keep up with the illness associated..
thanks for the info
very good video!!  keep up the good work and the good fight!!
just when you think they can t fk up anymore... they set it on fire
with as widespread as this is there is nowhere to go  this will have an affect on the whole country
i don t know about you  but i m tired of being culled  isn t it about time we started doing the culling
well i can tell you northern kentucky in between louisville and owensboro kentucky have turned off the ohio river intake
it is my understanding that distillation can t remove certain chemicals that boil at or  below the boiling point of water  so you need to incorporate a carbon filter into the process. would be interested to hear more info on the subject.
@mike-my2fo  my distiller has a little carbon filter in it. and a chamber that allows the vocs out. so i guess the important thing is to get a real  electric  distiller   50-75 on walmart or amazon  to cover all of the bases.  but you have definitely pointed out the disadvantages of distilling through a non-distiller method since there are ways of just doing it on the stove or over a fire pit
@foxy1802  thanks for the reply!
@mike-my2fo  thanks for your reply too.  it motivated me to dig a little deeper. i wondered why my electric distiller had a carbon filter in it  and why it has the chamber for voc release. now i know.
when the people of that area start the eventual lawsuits over this mess  wonder how many of  those in charge  right now  will be leaving the country
how are things going there after the fire at oak ridge facility
i live in connecticut and have already seen ash on friday on my vehicle  from that moment on i decided no garden this year. i have strived to be organic and now it s impossible.
i would have taken my kids and fled at least 400 miles on day one.
thank you pnamen
you know u can t drink your well water when u can  light the snow in your property on fire.
thank you.
i know what  let s have the who tell us what to do.
so i read that black rock and van guard own much stock in both that railway and many big media outlets
as absolutely horrific this one is  what about the fire in tn yesterday 02 22 2023 ! ! oak ridge nuclear weapons facility on fire  knoxville tn
it s totally healthy to drink the water. i m sure the health secretary will gladly drink from the river. sarcasm
ty for your heartfelt service dear...
hard to do when you follow god s commandments.  thou shalt not kill.
well they were made to broken sometimes sorry to i m sick of sitting here doing nothing
@joeyank2451     me too.
oh i ts past time.
i believe in times of war  it s acceptable. after all  david slew goliath. there s other examples  i just can t recall without reviewing my bible notes.
uncommonnews777 on yt has some soil remediation ideas so you can garden next year
indoor gardening
@barbpaq  need berklee water filter water is contaminated and not taking chances  i thought of that but yeah will have to plant healing plants in garden this year and throughout yard to help soil hopefully.
@tinaalmeidam4479  white rot fungus will remediate your soil.  did you see my comment above  great tips for water and soil contamination remediation
the fire was small and contained. all employees are safe and accounted for.   they returned to work later that day. i live close to where this happened
any idea of the area this will cover
that plume is still moving. highly toxic.
the funds better come in right now for these folks bcs what are they going to do if they have a mortgage  how are they going to pay to live somewhere else and their home mortgage  not to mention the children.  i do hope that the railroad takes care of everyone s home and the needs of living somewhere else.  it s easier said than done to just leave.  i don t think it s easy to find a rental property.  if they have pets  even harder.  just like the hotels. they wouldn t allow these people to stay if they had pets. so yes  their lives are upended.  granted it is better for their health to get out of there  but it cannot be easy.  i can t believe we live in america and our own gov. agencies are careless and irresponsible.  t.y.  p.n. for giving info. that the letter agencies do not give.
it s ran into the mississippi river..the main basis of all it s a deal for intel to have a processor facility in ohio
you boil your water to destroy biological contaminants. whoever said to just boil the water is a goddamn villain.
i am in ky. 30 miles south of cincinnati. they are suppose to be turning off the water pumps to municipal water supply while the chemicals pass. will our water ever be ok
water turns to wormwood  this will effect many states down stream of this spill.
hey patriot nurse long to no see.  gif bless you from katy  texas
how will that water ever be cleaned  i m sure it is leaching into all the other waterways. all of the water is being contaminated.
which direction
i am trying to find a map that is tracking it but it is being hidden or something.  have you been able to see where it is going
@chevyguy-ray  eerily like that netflix movie white noise
@chevyguy-ray  so it s moving east north east.
i saw someone who monitors air quality regularly..entire east coast are already showing poor air quality and yellow sensors from nj to connecticut that was yesterday i saw this video! cant copy amd share!
@serenityrn  we had 3 snow storms and 2 rain storms  since the derailment took place. map out from columbiana county to mercer county pennsylvania.
@serenityrn  maine has tested clear so far
i wonder if zeolite could pull this crap out of the water   this is used to pull metals out of water fish tank water.
i think you should also consider where your food comes from. is the meat  cheese  eggs  and milk coming from this area.
it s the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine!
fellow americans....  this effects us all!!!   the ohio river runs to the mississippi river which runs to the oceans.  please realize this will have a ripple  tsunami  affect.  think about food  air  water  and waste..  this is much bigger than what you re thinking.  it will take time  but it is happening.
not only do they play it down they ignite it and make it worse
your a blessing
this will be far worse than the bp disaster
odd how most are only talking about the ohio not the others. the one is pa is pretty bad as well.  either way  something about 3 4 of the worlds becoming undrinkable in the last days comes to mind. guess we ll find out soon enough. fun and games for everyone.
why cant they be made to make this right  things are truly hopeless
yep.  it s best to depart there  and seek healthier  safer places.  albeit a lot of these folks don t thee financial means just to pack up  and leave.  shalom
great informative video thank you for sharing this information.
good question  i don t know but you should only drink bottled water for the foreseeable future.
@lennyanders1639  what about bathing  dishes and laundry
@joanhenson4567  your water authority can best answer that question  they will be testing your water so it s important you get the results of that testing.
this a hundred times worse than the love canal waste dump in the 1970s in new york and that still has not been remedied 50 years later.
did this happen after the balloon passed over the nation  follow the money people!
solution  rain water   bottles water.  rain water should be safe at this point. keyword is should.
all politicians and epa and fema officials need to be the test gauges for whether or not the water is safe. they can go first have a big gulp let us know how it works out if it works well all right we re in. i guarantee them to you they wouldn t have a sip of it they won t even come to the area. hypocrisy of this government is just beside anything i could imagine i say we take 500 gallons over to washington and see who wants a sip. they wouldn t let us in the city gates with it.
amen sister
lets see the politicians drink the tap water!
where do they go  they have no way of ever selling these homes. what if they can t just have 2 mortgages. let alone trying to buy another home in this climate. how does someone leave their entire life  livelihood and assets without any way of getting a return on it
anything that requires water for life will be affected. everything. move and start over.
i can t shake the feeling all this is planned
people need to remember or research three mile island in 79. got in the air  then the dairy industry and then the people. now this mess is in the water and ground by the spill and rain from the toxic clouds. where ever the first rain storm fell will be effected too.
bravo!!!!
thanks from idaho! i ve been telling everyone the same thing.
read the wikipedia description of vinyl chloride and prepare to be terrified.
thank you dear patriot nurse!!
oh i know and i don t believe it was a accident i personally think it was done on purpose by either government or someone higher up bc it doesn t sound rite at all to me personally
i believe this was done deliberately
i watched them on the news from where i m from. sometimes folks  you got to get up and move. especially during war. which were at war.
sue them and move!
just a question what will happen when the land and water heats up this spring i am thinking more releases of toil fumes
love to you!  the democratic death cult has no care involved here.  it s horrible!  it s hard to love these monsters.  i know jesus says to  but it s a difficult task.
ask your chemist he ll tell you it s going to be like 6 yrs
i sure do remember.  i was a third grader and we were told to get under our desks that day.  i was about 35 minutes south.  not sure if early onset arthritis at 16 was caused by this  amongst many other strange health issues  but i often this it was.  severe bone pain.  anyway  such a sad story.
burning it was a big mistake ..college education at its best
reminds me of love canal by niagara falls where they had built a community on top of it they still haven t cleaned it up yet they bought the the property and put a fence around it look it up
soo  basically they need to distill their water rather than boiling it
i want to move a very rural area and be off grid as much as possible. i can t afford it though. anyone have some advice  i feel so overwhelmed by the events worldwide.
what water can they drink then  distilled
contaminated soil and areas can be claimed by the government and force people to leave and move into 15 minute cities
going on a vacation is not going to fix this.
and i ask  what king of chems are  created with a combination of all of these chemicals
if the water isn t safe and the chemicals were burned into the air  is collecting rain water even possible
amen patriot nurse. get out now!
how are they going to just pick up and leave not like they are going to be able to sell their houses
i feel the same way.  i m so ready to move off grid. i m trying to figure all this out and how to go about it.
if they would have used liquid nitrogen  they could have frozen everything in place and stopped the leaks also and kept everything froze till the tanks were pumped off and then the ground removed and that would have stopped this disaster i am a person that knows do the homework thank you.

is there a way to help family s relocate away from the area  even if it s temporarily. we would love to help give shelter to at least 1 family with children we don t have much but for now we can provide shelter and clean water here in texas if they can make their way here.
this is a spiritual war friends  and the king is calling his people home. godbless folks!
what has happened to all the farm animals
the  cloud  moving east on the wind makes at least one major city. in the water  downstream to the gulf of mexico  beware.
it s been my experience  to observe that most suffer from 20 20 hindsight. very few... hardly any  make their move  until after the cold hard facts kick em in the teeth. at that point they are woefully unprepared for  the journey   and at best  hope for the sympathies  or hospital ities  of others who are not interested in babysitting grown children. who guards the farm  decides. wrong or right  that s the way it is.not everyone is supposed to survive.where ya dippin yer nachos
however i would consider ths more akin the chernobyl. with the effects lasting generations.
i wonder if a water distiller like you see on amazon would work to purify the water
this assumes they wanted to stop the leak.
when you did your homework  did you calculate the number of tanker cars of liquid nitrogen would be required  and how you d get that trainload to the site
@brinsonharris9816  liquid nitrogen stays solid a good long time you are using cryogenics now that could have changed the adom s of the chemicals and molecular structure of the chemical making some of them inert the gases expanse 9 to 1 it expanse 9 cubic feet to every 1 foot of o2 the local welding shop could have had enough to get it stopped in a 100 pound bottle by that time they could of had a tanker brought in to main taine the effected area and you needed to keep the flashpoint below 7.9 degrees know this would have worked removing 2 sides of a fire heat and then oxygen fire risk would go down by 3 4   the hazmat thing has been done wrong for years it is all about money
@kevinragsdale-wu3vr  fascinating. it s all about adoms. and main tane. but back to my question  how many tanker cars and how would you get them to the crash site
@brinsonharris9816  you would only need one tanker truck and up and down that river i am sure they could have found one very fast
@brinsonharris9816  in a pinch they could have used co2 liquid form from the local welding shop could have been hauled by pickup truck to get started they come in 300 pound bottles
god bless you for your compassion and willingness to help. perhaps contacting a local church in that area might be able to direct you to a family wanting to relocate.
@purpleroses6492  great idea. i ll see about doing that 1st thing tomorrow. they would probably be better at confirming it s a family rather a random person on the internet claiming to need help and it being a bad person. we have kiddos too so i worry about all other children in danger out there.
berkey water filters best from my research. check it out!
yes he is sis. he is the cloud by day and fire by night.
just think how many truck drivers are driving around carrying who knows what onboard if you know what i mean.
saw a diagram showing how that ohio water flows all the to the mississippi river.
alphabet soup people  truth
love canal or worse!
the dioxins...very hard to clean up.
see... per usual. of course it s bad. how will it effect us  well obviously ppl that live there will at some point be affected. as time goes on it will get others. this is nothing new! it s super unfortunate. this is what had been going on for a very long time. this is nothing new! they will keep on and on with this. nothing new under the sun! folks these ppl we watch on yt etc aren t telling us anything new. yes maybe before we started watching sm and maybe some news on tv but not one thing new. so what i do know it do best i can.. remember who my father is cuz seriously not playing.. not anything different going on. live your life love our father. that s all we got. moving.. piling up with food etc reading these books. watch and see... time and time again this goes on. i agree to listen to your gut and pray to your heavenly father but this world been doing this over snd over. i love y all.. do not be afraid but don t listen to anyone but our father. i m exhausted from these folks talking.. nope do you and i love y all
you re telling us that boiling water won t do it  but you re using celsius as your temperature there s a really big portion of us that don t know what the temperature is celsius is translated to fahrenheit you need to tell us
it s the bad news that makes the good news good  late pastor adrian rogers
the epa is not reporting the fluorocarbons released in the recent kissimmee florida nursery manufacturer. another thing to examine is the 4 railroad derailings recently that resulted in huge chemical spills happened in red statesthe us railroad infrastructure is in poor repair  but look at the billions of taxpayer s money being sent overseas.
there is something at work.  good and evil are moving their pieces into place it seems for the final battle.
this is very concerning on how badly the government is acting like this is a big nothing.. all these people concerned about the earth and climate change seem to be very quiet at this time.  these people need major help.
our country s farmland has just been poisoned. food chain being assaulted.
a tank manufacturing plant is about 76 miles from the train derailment.  this was sabotage.
my gut says earth is not a safe place...lord god  take us home!
sadly some people don t have the means to   get up and go .
awesome blessings in y shua the messiahthankyou for confirming
they really are keeping it quiet bc where i am we haven t even heard that there was a spill.
its ironic that they mandated the rail road worker couldn t go on strike last year and then this happens. i guess they are vital to the economy.
amen sister god is the one to look to and trust in god bless you sister
that s exactly what is happening
we re living in critical times hard to deal with.  2 tim. 3v1-5
the govt new policy is turn there head and it ll go away  smh
thank you for your insight
sooooo.... sounds like we have another chernobyl....
tore says  says it was a possible cover up of something else that was on the train.
weren t such gases and chemicals used in past warfare  as weapons  .  .  .
sigh. um. someone knew about this beforehand. and i think i can prove it. the sign of wormwood was mentioned in a video. i had no idea they meant this. but the more i think on it. it looks like they knew. if they caused it  i don t know. but i tried to let law enforcement know about this guy and his freaky videos. plus the us army.
buttigieg took 10 days to comment on this  this is a horrible low ball of the true magnitude of this disaster.  this seems to be our version of chernobyl  but in slow motion and the administration is sitting on it s thumbs.
i grew up on a farm 7 miles from there. it used to be a small town surrounded by farms  including firestone farms up the road. my family is in east palestine or very close.     . run!!!
right on top of the biggest fresh water aquifer in north america.  this was by design!
politicians are the worst criminals!
terrible  i had to drive through detours on 51 and got forced into plume while returning my son from pa..nightmare..red eyes sore throat..nervous..angry
pretty much knew that  from you and other sources...
i m in cincinnati and last wednesday the sky did not look normal. the sun looked dusty the sky was a dusty yellow color. zero media coverage on this
declare all their land property contaminated and move all them people to a smart city..  for their safty!!
imaging transporting a  nuke warhed  or the most dangerous item known to mankind with zero precautions and zero accountability.  thanks blackrock and all the demons involved.  who would want to hurt the water and food supply..  no accident folks
i m 116 miles away and there are many here who are nauseous and vomiting. please don t drink the watermy animals are vomiting
is there benzene in these compounds
just saying the names of those chemicals out loud sounds like summoning demons
rev 17 13
i would suggest this is like love canal.
epa should of been doing their job day one of this. stream blockage. not set fire do it. bring people bottled water. evacuate more than 1 miles radius.  pay for hotals for a long time. the tain company   and dewine need to get together to pay out for lost land and homesm they won t.  they didn t do anything until those people made noise across the us. . i m 1 hr around there. i use to live much closer. this breaks my heart. even if the wreck wasn t planned. the lack of fixing it early  is a planned situation.
wounder if this is the start of relocating us to the big cities!

we should send a bottle of water to all the politicians who say it s ok to live there.  i wonder if they will drink the water
look up the movie white noise . guess what it s about and where they filmed it!
this was on purpose  this is a crime
does anyone know of a map that might show the affected areas of this whole thing
distillation. remember chemistry class with the tubes  figure out how to do that at home. shalom
and i doubt it was an accident
so what is the circumference of the damaged area  i live in midwest ohio.
blackrock owns the company that make these chemicals
thanks!
thank you my friend !
what about canning it
what if this was on purpose
they will just dilute it and add more chemicals
thank you for sharing  i say getout!!
it s really more on the order of love canal or bhopal india. only difference between this incident and bhopal is the residence down wind in bhopal died of cyanide poisoning immediately   this chemical spill will be slow death an genetic defects for humans and animals over decades.   the ohio flows into the mississippi eventually  into the gulf of mexico. the folks downstream in the mississippi are going to get a taste of the juice. in addition comparing this to to the exxon valdez is an apples and oranges comparison..   exxon valdez  caused trouble for birds and other wildlife. however oil is  biodegradable which means the microbes and nature will actually consume it as a food even without a cleanup. and it will clean itself up.
i have been looking for the same thing.  a map of the waterways it affected and where the plume went.
looks s though it was an act of terrorism
it was.  there was even a netflix movie made a few months ago about this exact thing in the exact town.  it is called  white noise .  same as event 201 turned into the plandemic.

no ifs  my question is how could anything human have a hand in this
@serenityrn good question! i ve wondered the same thing for the longest time. i become more convinced all the time that they can t possibly be.
ohio  pa need everyones help its much worse then the news is telling you        plz plz plz help
i heard people 400 miles away are getting a black oil film on their widow and car windshields

you know  something tells me that this is only the first of many of these kind of  accidents .
the local government is paying those poor people off with a  1000 and lose any chance of more compensation.

how do we avoid dairy meat eggs from that region
please share brighteon news health ranger comment and this video far and wide!!
we had another place blow uptoday in ohio near cleveland
can these chemicals be filtered out via reverse osmosis  i know that you said that they cannot be filtered  but i was hoping that reverse osmosis might be a solution that was not thought about.
ugh!
change diet is only way
@serenityrn  or grow own if can
@serenityrn  you mean go vegan  no  thank you. that is not appropriate for humans.
@sdraper2011  i live in philly and there s a store not too far away that sells live chickens for people who like their meat fresh.  the chickens live their lives indoors in cages.
@sdraper2011  lol what is appropriate  we have unique nutritional needs . i want clean food  very basic! how ever we can source this will be a growing challenge!
@serenityrn  my family doesn t eat like that. the point is  how can we be certain our meat dairy eggs aren t contaminated
that s what i heard. i called apec water systems - i am using their ro system and was told that it does remove vinyl chloride among many other voc s. that is what they claim at least.
@zizi40  thank you for that data point. that gives me hope. i ll have to research it some more. hopefully  apex and all of the other manufacturers of r.o. filters are not owned by blackrock or vanguard. if they are  i ll have to question the things they claim even more. i appreciate you taking the time to call them and to answer my post! stay safe out there.
171 c is 339 f.  yeah  right !!!
bring back the hang mans noose for every person in the chain of command that gave the permission to set those chemical poisons on fire
this was a conspiracy!
200 hundred birds dropped dead in maryland  about 300 miles south east.  winds blowing the gas.
don t forget west virginia!
you are on your own. no one is coming to the rescue.
you don t have to be qualified to see the obvious
the highest population of amish are in ohio   pennsylvania
5 to 10 half life s is estimated life of these toxic chemicals. that s 500 to 1000 years.
yeah  but  but  let s talk about something much more dangerous  gas and wood stoves.
that s going to be expensive
class action lawsuit.
75 000 farms in the area. predictive programming with the movie  white noise . vanguard and blackrock own lots of the food companies in the area - also kraft with 200 food companies under kraft.  blackrock and vanguard own the norfolk railroad there in ohio and most of the real estate in the world. berkshire hathaway also owns some of the above-listed.  when was  berkshire hathaway heard before  oh yes allegedly allegedly allegedly put out stacks of bricks allegedly during past riots.
hello    i hear a sadness in your voice.  is anyone speaking of the nuclear fire in oak ridge
i m 33 miles northwest of east palestine in warren ohio seems the river runs south i m going to assume we re safe here i can t get an answer anywhere.
look at who the share holders are of train 3 stand out like sore thumb. and part of esg system
more importantly...was it really an accident
this is your chance to take care of your own problems and not pester foreign countries
east palestine ohio rolled out digital id health app before train crash@ thephaser
thank you..
what a perfect way to eliminate a healthy control group  heartbreaking honestly
they also own the  cleanup crew  blackrock vanguard as well as the railroad
follow the
how long does that stuff stay in the clouds   how long will it be raining down on the world
will reverse osmosis work for the water
anyone who thinks this was an accident  i have a railroad bridge to sell you.
we ask these people maybe can stock up some water before it seeps in wells
hearts will be weighed.  those who are faithful to god will be spared.  we are living through the great flood of noah 2.0.  heaven calls this time  a cleansing .  those that have been harmed will turn on those who harmed them.  god wins.  jesus wins.
the government should move all the people that want to move.
maybe call gretta thunberg!
the times 2017-2024 america s judgement is at hand
i live 30miles away and i m so sick rn and i m scared
absolutely ridiculous to suggest we can simply take a vacation...give your head a shake. if this is as bad as projected we can never return. everything porous in our homes  the water  the soil etc. is contaminated. my goodness people wake up....a 2 week  6 weeks or 3 months away only delays the inevitable. for those of us in the contamination zone the solution is much much more complex.
this is exactly what my gut is telling me!  the only good thing i can think of that might come of this  is that it is one more reason to re-elect president trump.
probably not. the small size of the molecules is key to the issue. the reverse osmosis membrane filters down to a certain size. you need to know the size of the molecules involved and the exact capability of the filtration system.
i called apec water systems  using their ro and was told that it does remove vinyl chloride. it was only a claim made by the lady customer service agent  nobody really knows much yet on what kind of filter would remove it and if at all.
amen.
these past few days watching my portfolio decline is very disheartening. holding doesn t really profit much  any idea how on how to earn better on the short run

all read kjv bible romans 8  the carnal mind  ie  the world   has always been at enmity with our lord and savior jesus christ! pray   read and believe the scripture for salvation  wisdom and discernment!
there s no way i would stay there. this administration  regime is the worst of the worst.
well  farm animals have died  and water has been poisoned due to this disaster  so yeah  this is serious and very concerning. ecological disaster indeed. ohio people  please be careful.
i live in rogers   ohio. i m 7 miles from the burn sight. i have well water and will personally be having my water checked frequently. that being said i think it is being blown out of proportion by the media.
praise king jesus!
it might be worthwhile to see where the railroad is going to bury the toxic waste
thanks for the recommendation many traders are having this issue as well  please how can i connect with her
please  how do i reach her. am really interested  i guess is only risky not to try her method out
thank you for this. will definitely reach out to her now. thanks again
wow mrs mia henry  really helped me for real  trading with her strategies trading has been going smoothly for me as i ve been able to raise over almost 4 btc when i started at 10k in my first deposit
mrs mia henry is the real deal when it comes to trading. i m a living testimony too
mia henry is the key to robust profits. i m currently trading with her also. started off with a  low amount and now my portfolio is unbelievable
coincidentally i met mrs mai henry  in a conference in dallas. she shared me her views on the market and her strategies were really mind  blowing!. i really recommend her
a complete thread of spam. keep your money
your comment is interesting as it is coming from someone who is there  right now  and you are saying that it isn t that bad and is being blown out of proportion.
oh no. they are actually down playing it. the chemicals involved in making plastics are the absoliute worst. if i were you  i would move. hopefully you are a renter so moving is easier. good luck and god bless.
@jessicalubien5424  i m thinking about buying cheap homes in the area when everyone else moves  we have a large apple orchard approximately half way from here to the burn sight that has been family owned for generations just announce they are selling. i m sure they see the writing on the wall locals have said they would be afraid to eat stuff grown in this soil
this area is a huge conservative area. 75  of the county voted for trump. trump is visiting wednesday. i don t expect we will be seeing biden here. makes you wonder
i expect more disasters in rural and small town usa.  part of the plan.
investing in cryptocurrencies should be on every wise person s bucket list now  in a few months you will be thrilled with the decision you made today.
where will this flow to in ky
when you speak o ve the water  are you saying waterways as rivers and the creeks that led to rivers from that area. then down the ohio river.wow if so the town s that pull water from ohio river to purify for the town and surrounding area are   wowmy thought is the aquifers through the state. make me curious to witch direction the water comes from for my family their. it would be nice to know a guy
evil  evil  evil government.
i m too poor to leave and have no where to go.
climate has always changed!
i live in pa. and have gone to east palestine every week to buy from the amish farmers markets there on route 14 however that is the end of that as who knows how polluted the ground has become..from that plume of toxins in the air..i know i am not the only person that feels the same...it is a shame what they have done to us..where are all the environmental protestors..has anyone seen them...hmmmm i wonder what that is about ...lets have another climate change conference ..what a joke..lets talk about what really is changing the climate

i don t get the comparison to the bp spill  very different chemicals involved.
my life has completely changed because i am making  15 250 from my  4 000 investment with bryan dury.
i heard that mr bryan dury invests a lot and how good is he please how safe is the profit
after watching so many youtube tutorials on trading  i was still losing money  until mr. bryan dury started managing my investments  i was making  6 800 a week.  god bless mr brian dury.  he has been a blessing to my family.
he is active     on telegram
wow  i ve seen a lot of recommendations on bryan dury  is he really that good
@bryandury
i am from denver  colorado  usa.  i contacted him and he helped me a lot  he brings me so much profit.  he was successful sooner than we thought.
i ve never seen any of his clients complain about being lost... i think he s too perfect.
please  how can i contact mr. bryan dury   i also want to invest with him.
he is active     on telegram
does this stuff go  up  into the atmosphere  or  down  into the ground    so it does not evaporate  people...this is scary shit. i think there is a huge problem here that is not being addressed...
hello  happy sunday
looks like tptb are hard at work on their agenda...
time to move.   question is... where
i m in lexington ky and i had a rash after taking shower this morning
thanks for the info
i think the comparison it s the level of impact or scope of the effect on people  environment.
now i think o ve the land. the land known as our cornbelt and how this is going to affect
georgia guide stones suggestions put to action....
i m in fort wayne indiana we have the st. joe river the st. mary s river and the maumee. we are screwed!!!!
the american people still don t care about any of this stuff.   they re much more concerned about who is going to win the super bowl each year.
who ordered it to be set on fire
mushrooms  i ve heard they clean the water
i wonder how far that chemical  plume in the sky  will travel. 50-100-500 miles. it rains are your gardens destroyed..
you posted this video 7 days ago and youtube is showing on my feed as it being posted 7 hours ago. censorship at its best.
you mean if i boil motor oil  i can t get the motor oil out so i can drink it safely
it s a terrible evil!!!
praying.
i hope some of them have family far outside the spill area. for starters i would ask them to take my family in   and try to buy a camper to place on their property while i  look for employment. get far away as quick as u can. we all believe the government lies.  many nomads live in their cars.
if this happen during president trump s watch the news agencies would declare a world wide ecological disaster.                       jkl lv
i bet gates didnt have farmland near this
amen
i think that area of ohio is politically very red.  with dimocraps in control of federal government  the folks will get little help.
if it was ok why wont fema go in there ..... oh silly me what did they say oh ya it is to dangerous for them to go in there. but its ok for those poor souls that are residents.... my prayers are with the residents
no not the real truth.  it is serious.  i a  so sorry for them.
pn . i am  about  to  listen to this latest of  your  videos.  but  before i do   i  want  to  warn  you  and  your listeners  that  what  i  refer  to as  the deliberate  poisoning  of  the  5000  and   more  in  east  palestine   ohio    and  its   far flung surrounding  regions ........that   poisoning  is  not  the  most important  issue  here.   rather  the real issue is  the  deliberate tyrannizing of  not   only   east  palestine residents   but  of  the entire north american  population   by  the  us  federal government  and  colluding big  business .  this  is  nothing  more than  an  expansion   of  the  tyranny  imposed  by  governments   using  as  a pretext for  a  scamdemic   the chinese plague  beginning   back  in march  2020.    this is all  about getting more power  over   the  people.    there  ought   to  be  a  collective   nationwide  protest  over  this  issue    because  everybody is  a victim of  this poisoning  atrocity.....not  just  the people   in  ohio  and   pennsylvania.  now.......to   your  video!  ok   so  i  take  it then that  even activated  carbon  berky  filters  and such are  incapable of pulling out  these  chemicals  from  water  to make safe  for drinking.  that also means that  these  chemicals will  go  into all plants  trees   grasses   fruit trees   and  impact all of  our  food sources  including   meats   fruits  vegetables and  grasses eaten by  our  food  animals.  the incentive by   federal govt  and  the railroad  to    lie about the short  and  long  term  effects  of  this  chemical carnage  is  called money  !!!  i  have  calculated that  it  would require  1million  dollars per  family  and  unlimited  free lifetime health insurance to even  begin to properly  compensate all people   impacted  by this  atrocity     or  about  10 billion dollars.   conservatively  speakking   and   possibly  even more.   biden s  and  his whitehouse  bozos  blow that  much  cash in ukraine  in about  two months   !!   good job   pn.
everyone forgets the 2 aquifers that east palastine sits on.  it s not just the rivers... it will be everyone s well water.  many many states.

how can secretary buttigieg not feel responsible for this disaster
could it be   this happened bc of the name .. palestine.. a clear message to somebody s  .
this is scary!
the train company and the media are owned by the same people
also nestle water plant is in east palestine!
they did it on purpose
why aren t the chemists speaking out too
i had heard that a lot of the bottled water comes from this area. i wonder how much spreading of chemicals is happening when a resident of the area does a load of clothes  that water goes to a treatment facility that does not treat for chemicals and probably then into a waterway.
were dose the groand water go   it dose not just sit there !!!!!
i don t want to eat anything or use any product from the affected areas!  imagine your shampoo and other products  bottled water  treated tap water  livestock
thank god bless sweer last
god bless ya..get the frig.out..and use credit cards to go!!!!this is your life....not theirs...you are.loved xxxxx
people are forgetting how much farm land and livestock are in that are and downwind. the food products from those areas will be toxic. this will impact the entire country.
why was there so much hazardous material on a single train.. why were they not contained in specialized multi layered containers.. too expensive it s too expensive not to!!!
america s chernobyl
they don t have money to take vacation
with the amount of lobbyists   the railroad pays to government   don t ever think citizens will come first they could care less about you that rail is probably 1million an hr when it s down.
i cant say anything but the answer is    yes it is very very bad
only in ohio
the devil comes to kill  steal  and destroy human being s.
this was an intentional mixture
it s flooding the east coast right now
if you take your infected livestock with you won t you spread the contaminants
i wonder if the gubament will condemn the land and then offer a buyout  legally stealing the land with a problem they created  jmtc
worse than bp due to proximity to populations
these lies are just like the jab.
the major problems will be in pa nj and ny.

did you know that march 3  2023 another train derailment happened in ohio     only 200 miles from east palestine.
just wrecking all our food sources. no more fish
who the heck allowed this train to be exploded why did thay not cool this down
boiling does not get rid of solvents.
they ve been lying for a very very long time.who is the father of lies shalom
father god help your people   exposes all the lies and evil in the mighty name of jesus christ amen
it will take years to determine the severity of this  and as with everything else the government will never divulge the entirety of the devastation.  tuskegee airmen ring a bell
look up time beach  missouri
that is a point- blank hot zone i was suggest everybody get the hell out of there and don t ever go back what town is done as a township 30 mi around the accident site in 150 miles downstream and stop all wildlife from going down or getting out the way i see it the railroad needs to buy everybody a new house in another town for every square inch in every acre and if anybody says that s the place is safe is more than welcome grow a garden and drink the water
do a report on the who treaty coming up. 47 african nations rejected it.
atrocitythe train company should pay these people for all the contaminated land water homes and do everything after that too clean the environment
i hate it for the people that live there. it is not a solution   but maybe a great idea. we should move congress  and the executive branch to east palestine.  let them live there for a few months. let the drink the water that is safe.
where are the green new deal squad
sds not msds. msds went bye bye since 2015 16 by the global harmonized system

so down in the left-hand corner of her video  you will see something that looks like a jewish symbol  is that what i think it is
c mon man... safe and effective ...just like  the water is safe to drink in e. palestine
how do you bring the world population to a manageable size 500 000 000... just ask bill g.
where is greta   silence on this one means it s really bad.
it is not safe look at the streams river you hit the water it turns rainbow they lie
the gov still busy discussing the balloongate than this environmental issues.this is not american first but american last.
all planned
not to worry. mayor pete is on it taking another 2 months maternity leave.
i see greta thunberg and her cronies have been silent....you know what that means...nothing to see here folks  move along please...
our government criticize russa  yet our government is worse  they help the ukraine but not out citizens
capitalism has caused this tragedy.
my view. we drive a car and are hazardous.  then we have no license.  if you operate a train and are hazardous  there should be no license.
if the land and water are no longer safe and will not be safe in the future. leave now! and don t return. back during the 2008 financial crisis people were scared to default on their home loans and got suckered into mortgage modifications. when tax time came around those people had to be pay income taxes on the modification amount. imagine suddenly you owe  25k- 50k or more income tax seemlingly overnight. what they should have done was a strategic default - it s what corporations do all the time - you pull out as much equity as you can and you walk away. if you own homes in the path of this disaster do a cash out refinance and take that money and leave. your credit will recover in 5-7 years. the banks will hate this but screw them  save yourselves. if you re a renter  it will be harder. if you re a family it will be harder. i don t advocate divorce but signle women with children will get priority government assistance. do a strategic divorce. let the government pay to help you and when you re back on your feet get remarried. screw the government  it ll do the same to you if you let it. these people do not play by the rules they expect us to play by. it s time we play the game they way they play it!
aren t  we the people  actually the ones who would be paying for so called  government help
start growing hemp by all of the water ways affected from the chemical and biological weapon of mass destruction from the toxic train fire in palestine ohio
hey look  i m a  based conservative . here s some fear fear fear for you.
it s called land grab.   do you get it
move and sue
again.. could you imagine if we had a republican in office. innocent men  women  children and animals caught in the middle. so so sad.
i hate to say it but...pn your time is limited on youtube...the powers that be don t like it when you out their coverstory. just like the reporter who was arrested...freedom of speech at its best!i m surprised this video is still up  i bet its gone by this time tomorrow.
1044 derailment in 2022 if the info is right...why this one is so !!!     talk about.
zillow prices plummeted in palestine.regional carcinogen cases skyrocket. government is out of peoples control.
02 20 2023 hello nurse  teacher and  our best friend. again i forgot to thank your for your research. one question to you. i think that you are a christian jewish follower. do you believe that this event may just be the black horse from john the revelators work  this may kill millions of us along the ohio river. thanks again. don
screen went black
no worries nobody important lives there
jesus is coming. now.  repent and pray to be counted worthy.

i want to respond but i m not allowed freedom of speech in america.
yes i know. you nurses are all told that you are heros and smart.   i m sorry but nothing is further from the truth.
so  given  that we know the europeans invaded america and built the rail roads - is this any suprise
i m shari5this everywhere.
zero hedge stated that town was mostly trump voters. explains it all. like florida
where is our czar of transportation  oh  that s right  his only qualification is  diversity .... how many old tracks do we have that are falling apart and causing these massive derailments please read ayn rand s atlas shrugged again.
the federal government should pay to relocate the citizens of east palestine.!! that whole city is now a superfund site.! there are about 5000 citizens there  so if the federal government has billions to provide hundreds of thousands of illegals freebies  and give ukraine 500 million  they can take care of them.!!!!
for the disgustingly evil reprobate minded psychopaths who committed this planned crime against humanity  i thank the almighty creator god that there truly is a place called  the lake of fire   without which  there would be no righteous judgment of any kind. judgment is coming to these enemies of god s creation and coming soon. we are in the time of jacob s trouble and the revenge of esau edom the red. revelation 11 18.
