I love seeing someone combining sharing their faith with their takes on gaming and nerd news and hope to one day be able to do similar in my own fashion. love your channel!

as long as you are sharing the word of God you are doing his work. you dont have to give a sermon to deliver his word. just by you sharing your faith and his worth you please him in in those acts.

keep doing what youre doing I have seen a couple of your videos and it is fantastic that youre integrating the faith into your videos

as a born and bread guy from ireland I take no offence by your  t shirt   also not  religious.... but keep your faith  mel .

another banger. also if y all dont mind saying a lil prayer for us out in north west texas. we have wild fires burning like crazy right now. much love yall.

I love watching your videos  in many ways you mirror how I feel about stuff. however Im not religious. but listen to your takes on the Bible and religion in general is interesting to me. makes me feel we can disagree  but also come together.

as a fellow Christian  I like your additions of simple Bible verses and short commentary  it adds to my day without listening to a sermon or an hour long study.

I love the Bible verse with this and how you brought it all in.  thank you!  that is awesome!

I actually enjoy melonie's Bible verses  strong message...even though I think religion is silly and made up

hey. I found your channel yesterday and I thought that you make interesting videos on gaming. saw you in my recomended today and to find out that you were Christian was surprising. I think you have some good ideas  and some interesting trivia   so I ll be sure to watch your uploads regurarly.have a happy st. patricks day!

I love your stuff and I love that youre Christian

as an atheist  its refreshing how a content creator shares Christian values with their audience.

I kinda randomly found your channel but I definitely dig your vibe  gamer  antI woke crap   laid back Christian and not trusting the govt   mainstream  news   all awesome things

never knew about toxic positivty until you posted about it.its not possible to be positive all the time  we have something called feelings and there is nothing wrong with being sad or so forth sometimes..its part of life.if more would be open on how they really feel  I think the world would be a better place..love your content btw.shalom my sister in Christ
