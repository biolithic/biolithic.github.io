thank you for saying we have a constitutional republic patriot nurse!
you re absolutely right patriot nurse  in saying that the usa is no longer a force for good in the world.  and that s a painful reality but one we must face.  it truly hurts deeply to make that realization
very seldom do you ever hear anyone say that the biggest job of government is to protect the rights of the people. not to keep them safe. absolutely right. property rights are the backbone of liberty. you nailed it patriot nurse.
my children and i have been watching and listening to testimonials of people who lived through the great depression   as part of history and science  but i m stressing to them the importance of spiritual preparedness and getting ready to go without... some people will lose their minds -not joking - and we have to embrace what the lord has in store for us . thank you pn for providing a sturdy skill set to prepare us in many ways! may god bless you
just watched squirrel tribe channel before this  and the research she s been doing on the east palestine ohio insanity is crazy. it s worth checking out. channels like these are helpful getting the word out on this evil. thanks. peace
your ability to break down the narrative and speak truth never disappoints !
we the people are definitely under attack by enemies foreign and domestic.stay armed 24 7  stay vigilant  stay faithful.god bless you pn.
the more i try to warn people  the more they avoid me. so now i warn them and that s the end of it. what they do with the information is up to them.
when our government found out they could make money on debt and wars and have lost almost all of them or just killed and slandered other countries was the start of the downfall. now we are up against countries that were in multiple wars and survived them. this country has only been around a short time and has created so much misery and death its sad. special blessings to you pn and everyone
wow. i am so glad you decided to get up and make this video. you struck on both points that are key   relevancy and legitimacy.  this is all you need to know for what s coming. share this  widely. so much here in this short video.
yes i agree. it s been a burden on my heart to know what s happening and see my family and friends not have a clue what s going on. they don t want to hear the truth. they don t want to prepare. family members have turned cold against each other. i feel like my husband and i are the only ones awake! everyone else seems to be walking around in a delusion. i pray daily for others to wake up and that the lord help me with this burden on my heart. god bless you for everything you are doing.
thank you so much for this. here in ohio. upper ohio river valley. knowing that the river where we get our drinking water is forever changed.  no help there or for our people. no water for weeks but billions of our tax dollars to a foreign nation. why. stay safe and keep on. blessings
i love this woman  beauty brains and common sense.
it s so upsetting when this is absolutely the truth and i feel it s our time to strap up and march on our leaders which is our god given right and yet my own family thinks i m crazy. stay strong people.
prepped up 23 years ago and maintained it. my kids and grandkids are prepped. knew this was coming from the 80 s. tried to reason my self out of critical thinking but failed.
my husband and have both conjectured out loud more than once since the pandemic too many things were synonymous with the fall of the roman empire! glad to find like minded folks out here such as yourself spreading the reality! god bless you
absolute power does not corrupt absolutely  absolute power attracts the corruptible.   frank herbert
i enjoy watching your discussions   it s refreshing and on point for what s  really going on .
they  should be removed from office immediately and imprisioned!!
good point on the baby boomers not having enough children! you are correct  and i have been preaching and encouraging christians to have larger families 4 doesn t count  for 50 years! im still working  and intend to keep up my practice as long as i am physically and mentally able! as far as i know  i am the  oldest in age  practicing midwife in the knoxville area. i hope to carry on!

yes. so tired of hearing about  our democracy.
can you run for government somehow
@keithholloway5272  yeah we wish!!!!! they wouldn t let her be elected as we know they are  s elected
a constitutional republic was what we had  but we couldn t keep it. now we have  elected  officials who are actually appointed  and our votes count for nothing.
saying it and doing nothing to keep it will cause us to lose it.
@deniswauchope3788 my vote went right into lake michigan. i live in commie controlled wi unfortunately.
the u.s. never was a force for good around the worldbut now it s coming into view
we are the usa  and we can change that fact as it now is
that fact grieves my heart.  we need to repent and return to god.  god bless you
babylon usa

this lady does nail it!!
pray. plan. stay strong in faith at all times. god bless all americans. -ohio
we have a banana republic. sheesh  what a disaster this has all become.
@rodom2  it s lost...
@johnnypastrana6727  so are we monkeys then c o the elites sir
we stopped being a constitutional republic a long time ago.  now we direct elect federal senators and allow illegal immigrants to vote the same as citizens.
yes
@burningsporkdeath bull
@robmack151  that s what i used to think and so did all my patriot friends who ve been extremely active in az for the last three years  nothing has changed and things got worse   get right with god
@ronbridegroom8428  we need not to turn our other cheek  but to turn theirs!
@spaceindian3769  and that is where you are wrong...more so than you will understand in your lifetime.
@spaceindian3769  so which of us was founded on the right of the individual that the same can choose to live their lives as they choose if you allow your way of live to be dictated by another you are not free.if you are not causing harm to another by living your life as you see fit  then what right does anyone have to challenge it
hasn t been a force for good for many years...but better late than never.
yes. we must recognize that  olympus   has fallen.  weep on your own time. organize  recruit and teach the remenant. we will build. deo vindice!!
ichabod is being written over her....
@conniegomez1321  as it was over israel in ezekiel
@feederdiaries4862  sodom and gomorrah hellscape
@dennissmith6783  yep
you said it!! i was gonna say that same thing. thank you
i watch squirrel tribe as well.  the people of america have to research and protect themselves.don t rely on a government or a politician to save you.   trust no man  says the lord.
was just going to post about squirreltribe! awesome researcher  she is uncovering corruption.
the great phoenix is almost upon us.....see archaic.
she has done a fabulous job connecting the dots
if we can get them to link and have pn show us a solution which she has been for a decade....sheesh play some music   laugh  find out what makes them happy. more importantly apply it all for our families we will be iight. it is a weight for some   yet this snatches the weight away  . thank you . very honourable.
squirreltribe cinema shotgun tim truth put out great information on this subject matter.
@krissaann7061  i live 3 miles from the toxic chemical release. i haven t been able to keep up with my ty channels. i listen to archaix. has he talked about this incident  i know he saw a period of prosperity for the us  but this seems like... how is that possible now
thank you. new channel to follow for me.
ohio   its ppl in east palistine  ohio will be ok by gods will   sue ns into oblivion. we can only hope.
@angelajeffries9205  god bless you   all good folks in eastern ohio. we all hope you sue ns to its end! stay strong   rebuild your town.
you stated the problem precisely  so no  need for me to basically repeat it. i ll simply say that i agree with you.
just domestic.
how about form and regulate your states militia to secure a free state
@susanauger3758  mostly yes  but not totally.
@watchman1178
@isaac357mag  i feel we have lost our will to fight. the leaders of the patriot militias are in the dc gulag  and it is just so wrong.
we always have been  what else is new.
@pamelarose1834  not all of us  many are just too afraid to admit it.
marsha  i share your frustration. watch the video showing yuri bezmenev and it will be come clear why most don t listen.
@marvinlee3450  because they are wiggly worms
amen
i ve been trying to warn my families for years. they just shrug it off and say i m overthinking and overreacting to things. when shtf comes  should i shrug them off when they ask for help
@dany-zl3jg  you re going to  need as many people by your side as you canso if they ask for help or wanting to help you just make like the old conversation never happened and start anewafter all we have is each other
zackly!
@dany-zl3jg  yes you should  or make them pay the price by telling them i told you so.   otherwise nothing will humble them!
it s because they just want to live their lives and be left alone  which they should be able to do in normal times. the problem is that they re losing that right by willingly staying ignorant and doing nothing.
@pamelarose1834   that has pretty much been done in every state!!
@isaac357mag   nothing to fear!  what s one more list to be on   join the patriots!!
@lylecoglianese1645  i m on all of em probably.
foreign  we would not have a foreign problem  if it was not for the domestic problem  causing it so fix problem here the foreign will go away
@watchman1178  not really  it was extremely general.  but ok.
@allen-gt5ng  --very well said...your exactly right these sobs
@isaac357mag   welcome!!
365 plus 1 on leap year.
@blackpillrising3164  and absolutely everywhere.
@pamelarose1834  yes  sadly  all groups have been infiltrated and taken over by controlled opposition leading them.  the base of this battle is spiritual so that is how it needs to be fought.
@truthseeker3031  i believe that god inspired the founding of this country and the men that wrote our constitution. that is why  a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state. where are our states militias and why are there no conversations about forming and regulating
@isaac357mag  be proud of that!
@d3riverbrat   agree!  they will lose!!
@lylecoglianese1645  amen  brother! they are in panic mode now  that is why they are excellerating  disasters   to try to ruin us quickly. but actually  it is a sign of early stages of their own demise. we still outnumber these criminals.
@d3riverbrat   they know they are well outnumbered!  they are losing their grip!
@lylecoglianese1645  exactly! they are bugging out.
@d3riverbrat   yep!!
it is a struggle to live in a parallel universe
reminds me of that popular quote  you can t handle the truth!   most have buried their heads in the sand.
i am so happy to hear that your husband is awake alongside you!! godspeed
yes  keep praying!  i am also.
you are not alone in this   there are many of us friend. stay strong  stay faithful  stay positive..
roger  this is where you set your face like flint and keep moving.
s to the i to the m to the p
they would much rather ask for forgiveness than permission.
your eyelashes are amazing. i don t know why i haven t noticed them until now.
yep many in my family think i m a conspiracy theorist
yes  spiritual discernment is a great blessing god gives to only a few  and at the same time  it is a massive responsibility and a double-edged sword. i believe god gives spiritual discernment to those who have the emotional and spiritual strength to take up the spiritual sword of god and move forward right into the face of evil with his word and the gospel of our salvation. 1 corinthians 15 1-4. god bless.
afforded by the constitution.  those patriots that believed and stood behind what they penned and signed.
@misskj7773  anyone that has the true holy spirit will be able to discern
@brad2548  can you please provide a scripture supporting your statement  i know holy spirit filled christ believers who possess no spiritual discernment. they are incredible individuals who love the lord with their whole being  but have absolutely no end days  discerning knowledge to the hour in which we are living. not all are given the gift of spiritual discernment 1 corinthians 12. god bless.
@misskj7773  you know   i think it s in order to apologize. i know several believers in which are oblivious to folks with impure improper motive and even though they study and pray diligently they can be taken advantage of by those with i ll will. so i m thinking they ve not exercised the potential discernment god wants his children to have when they re born again.  i m going to get my theology accurate and get back to you kj77. ok
@misskj7773  hallelujah
your not the only 1 who s family thinks crazy stuff about us too.  deep down they  know  but might keep going on with the lying for money etc cause there in denial of reality. thank the lord more people are speaking out educating people having the moral courage to tell it like it is god working thru us to be warriors of truth and god amen  god bless america
@johnberry2877  ok then  you hold on to that assumption tight now.
seems like a dream in this day   age!!
psalm 149. being butched by the saints with blades and bound in shackles is a brutal end.
elect  a clown  expect a circus.
agreed  i m with you.. what s the plan
@supernaphtali major rebellion.
@johnwurfel2862  i love this.
@boobtube.  and play stupid games and winning stupid prizes  we re screwed with no vaseline!
can you define who  they  are  so we are on the same page
@jerrythebaum4388  those who own the banks and media and entertainment etc.
@johnwurfel2862  sounds fitting
@jerrythebaum4388  are you serious    have you been living under a rock
yes  and yet they won t.
that only happens to us when we fuk up
you are cute
that s not the max punishment for treason...
@thenarrowroad7  how do we demand them to resign. joe biden   kamala harris  anthony blinken   alejandro mayorkas  merrick garland.
cool. another puppet will take their places  though. we need to go to the root of the problem  not the office sitters.
@johnwurfel2862  that will be their fate. they are ensuring it for themselves.
absolutely!!!
@starlite556  well then  we can either sit on our hands  or not.
and i refuse to pay for their imprisonment  when honest citizens can hardly have 3 hots   a cot. call it a  hangup .
@michaelshapiro1543  that is way too kind! lol
@d3riverbrat    thanks! but folks who know how to listen  as you do  understand.
@d3riverbrat    i hear you   5x5 .
they  have all the power and control so i guess you are suggesting they arrest and imprison themselves.
@mikejohn0088  as long as we give them power and control then yed you are right.
yeah  accountability to the grifters in government  that s rich
yes!! completely agree  more babies people!  i also promote that whenever possible.  guess who else does   putin!   he s smart!
and yes 4 is not really enough! but i guess it s better then 2  or  2.5 !
thank you for you do.  hopefully you don t have to promote vx for babies in ky
absolutely not now to be having babies! no child ever asked to be born  and having children to support a family or population is absolutely not the reason to have a child! have a child because it is wanted  and the parent has the responsibility to provide for the child  not the child providing for the parent! this distortion and dysfunctional mindset is why so many are angry  and the millennials are on the precipice of violence   parents  provoke not your children to wrath  is what the word of god exerts! love is the reason to bear a child and give that that child the opportunity that parents never had. parents have squandered the inheritance of their children!
excellent commentary on our day and times. i agree  . i truly appreciate your time.
phenomenal point about us being  chosen  to do this. that is precisely what i tell others who are occupied with their day-to-day tasks and either don t have the wherewithal or developed ability to do what we do. they are passengers on the train of life and we are the engineers and drivers. prophetic. truly prophetic. keep on keepin  on patriot nurse!
patriot nurse  thanks for what advice and words of wisdom that you share. i have been listening to your comments and advice for years. our problem is currently our representatives are talking more than they are doing.  we need to see legislative action that will stop these harmful actions against our nation. we need a national soul searching campaign to put all of our representatives on notice that they represent all of us  not just at a time of election. time is running short. if the bottom falls out i am not sure we will have the ability to rebuild this society in a positive and moral way. god bless you!
god chose us to be alive at this time and to see what is really happening. it does feel like a burden at times  as you say  when so many do not and cannot see the truth. my brother is a raving lunatic who believes all evil comes from putin and or republicans. his brain would implode if he realized the truth. his brain must be protecting him from reality.thanks for sharing with us. with so much evil and propaganda shoved in our faces every day  listening to you helps immensely. god bless you.
absolutely doing it on purpose. all they want is power.
thank you for always keeping our focus in this fog of war  where it is most important. the darker the world becomes  the brighter your light shines! it s lovely to see you  wish it were under better circumstances. good shabbos!
we are losing our freedom so fast it s unbelievable why so many are still going along with this!!! many countries have the similar governing system and indeed ran by bad people that lives a pathetic cowardice greedy life. they are literally just seating on the legacy of our forefathers who fought for the freedom we have today. compliance eventually leads to slavery and freedom taken. say no whenever possible! thank you patriot nurse for always keeping the fire  going ! it takes tremendous focus doing what you do! amen  and god bless you too
they need to be prosecuted for their actions against the people of the united states
thank you for doing what you do. you are one hell of a woman and patriot!
thank you as always  rachel!!! you are such an amazing patriot and have big giant proverbial brass balls!!!! you are as tough  and intelligent  poinient  and precise  honest  real  and unwavering in your desire to see our republic live on as you are beautiful  both inside and out! please know there are so many fellow patriots that are praying for your safety and prosperity!! may you keep up the good fight sister!!!
what you call a burden the bible describes as enduring.  love your channel  thank you for all your hard work.
god bless you. as difficult as this situation is and will get  never give up sharing your message.the people of our nation and of the world need to hear this so very badly!!!
i love your channel.  you are so clear about everything and i have been thinking and saying the same.  we are babylon that is collapsing.  you are so right on all fronts and i appreciate and value the historical content of what our forefathers laid out for us as americans.  i ve been prepping for quite a while.  beans  bullets and bandaids...good advice.  i ve been saying pray  prepare and protect.  keep up the good fight.  when you speak i feel like you are speaking for me as well.  thank you!!
blessings to you patriot nurse! thanks for trying to help to wake up the sleeping masses.
amen. sister if you study how the citizens in jerusalem  in the last 5 months before the city fell to the romans  tore each other to pieces you see the fate of a nation that denied god. they were demons in the city attacked by demons outside the walls.  only a remnant was led to escape the city before the destruction. trust in the only begotten  son of man. god bless.
pn  you are amazing. i ve been watching your videos for quite a number of years and when you address this topic it s like a  vulcan mind meld  with me or something. everything you say is synonymous with the thoughts i have constantly floating around in my head about where we are going as a people  nation  and world. of course  when i try to discuss any of this with most people  their brains turn off. for many reasons--probably the biggest reason is as you mentioned  they simply cannot deal with it  let alone even think about it. then there is normalcy bias. so many people have normalcy bias even though they may even  get it.  they just won t go there. the  it could never happen here  syndrome.luckily we have you to articulate all of this so much better than any of us could. every day that goes by makes it more obvious that we are dealing with a cataclysmic clash of good vs evil. and as you say  we here in the us are a lot like the very last days of the roman empire before the visigoths topped the hill. and we are certainly no longer a force of good in the world  at least from a bird s eye view of our government and diplomatic actions both abroad and right here at home. it s unfortunate that so many good people are now trapped in a very evil  cage.
you are correct.  it is a burden to be aware.  i am preparing in behalf of a dear family member who just doesn t  get it .  i bring up the current events on occasion and they just shrug.  god help us all.
love your site on yt.  agree with everything you say!  god bless!  praying for you and our patriot families in america
you re right patriot nurse..america has forgotten charity begins at home and spread abroad..pray for the residents in the ohio and mississippi rivers
yes girl! you are so right and this is a burden for sure. i know people that aren t ready to see or handle what is happening. it s so sad.
people like your brother cannot be reasoned with. i have tried to talk with those people and they immediately raise their voice and get so angry and regurgitate the msm talking points  beginning with republicans bad .trump is horrible  all of that
@tammygeorge7948  that is exactly what my brother does. i m not able to reach him with my words but i m praying for him.
it will be fun to watch them turn on each other!
yep
yes an all god fearing pro constitutionalist americans.i trust putin over biden
who s going to do it  themselves   it s up to the people who vote to vote for decent  moral  ethical people into these powerful positions in government.
@zombieapocalypse3837  we need constitutional patriots and honorable former military personnel in office. our troops are not warmongers. our troops want peace through strength. i am one of our troops.
@raymondjallen  personally i would make it a constitutional requirement to have served at least 10 years in the military and be honorably discharged to hold political office  no exceptions.
@zombie apocalypse  i would completely agree except for the 10 years prior service requirements. i think as long as you received an honorable discharge you should be allowed to serve in public office. if you violate your oath of office  you re fired.
@raymondjallen  ok i ll knock it down two years to eight years.  but only because i know  whether enlisted or commissioned  the first four years is automatic  you go up in rank simply by time served.  provided you stay out of trouble  show up on time  do your job  keep your hair cut and your uniform clean and pressed. the next four years  you only rise in rank by testing against others in your own rank and moving into and excelling in leadership roles.  qualities that any competent politician needs  plus above average ethics and morals.
@zombie apocalypse  that s fine  i served 8 years  and i was medically retired  and i would love to serve  but i can t afford to run.
yes  we have to endure  but we must not be tolerant of sin.
true god bless you
i hear ya  my family are nothing more then sheeple.
same here. it s a lonely road.
i have 2 sisters in law that are millionaires and have no preps and have no clue...when they visit they just laugh
i live with my daughter and enlisted. i prep  they laugh.i m 73 and have only social security.
yea  i have a few friends and family that think life is disney land. very sad  they don t want to hear it. as long as their bellies are full  they are satisfied.
i get the same..
for with much wisdom is much sorrow. as knowledge increases  grief increases.  ecclesiastes 1 18.
denial is a sad thing. at least you will be ready for them. god bless you.
your insights totally sync with what i am seeing in the world.the young generation has little knowledge of history.
we are the watchmen on the walls  patn. there always have to be a few that know what s going on just so that humanity will continue to survive instead of dying out. it is extremely! frustrating to so clearly see what others cannot. your comment about the roman empire and bread and circuses is so spot on. i have been trumpeting this for years but of course no one wants to listen. they d rather kill the messenger because it threatens their status quo.  everything happens in cycles and at some point every empire collapses and every governing body or government becomes tyrannical in its bid to hold on to power at any cost and by any means. that s the part of the cycle we re in now. the end of the cycle and things will get much worse before they get better. somehow or other it s going to be up to us to wake up the rest of the laggards but at some point the crisis is going to become self evident to the greater mass of the people. and when the greater mass eventually wake up and realize what s really going on and find they are woefully unprepared to weather the coming storm they will become very desperate and a danger to those that have prepared. the greater danger to those that have stocked up  some for many years  will come from inside rather than from the outside. for those that have had the foresight to prepare they will be forced to make some very difficult decisions in the coming years. who to support and who to deny. are we mentally prepared to use deadly force to protect that which we have so painstakingly accumulated  most i would say no. western society for the most part has become soft and weak. in no small part due to the concerted efforts of the various governments around the world working covertly in unison and giving away their power to un-elected ngo s like the who. the imf. schwab s little terrorist neo nazi group. we may as well call a spade a spade because that s what they are. it s times like these that allow the rise to power of extremist groups like schwab s little band of merry men. this is 1939 all over again but in a slightly different way because everything is now so interconnected.  in no way shape or form can we allow ourselves to submit to these most evil and corrupt of non humans. they cannot be human because they are so anti-human and dare i say it  anti-life. they serve a false god and in their delusional state believe they are serving the greater good. not realizing they have been co-opted and are serving the lord of darkness and acting in a satanic and demonic manner. if god represents the positive nature of the universe then there must be a negative force of equal power to balance the good as this is a dualistic universe and for every aspect of this 3rd dimensional realm there must be its opposite to maintain balance. think of the yin yang symbol which represents exactly that. when the time comes each of us must be prepared to stand up and be counted even if it means our lives. rather to die on our feet than serve on our knees. they can only kill us once. very easy to say now. i just hope i have the courage to stand up to them and be prepared to die for my beliefs. if it gets bad enough then not worth being part of this world anymore. how many of us are they prepared to murder to further their agenda  you inspire me with your clarity and your courage  patn. you truly are an amazing person.
i was born in 1960 my wife and i have been  blessed with 10 children. 6 boys and 4 girls  all very productive christian citizens. in a world of hedonism
your amazing pn  you are appreciated! proud to be loud! the time is now  no more lies  we the people must rise!
i am thrilled to know someone thinks the same way as i do! tyranny is upon us and i took an oath to protect you and all from this. i may be older  but the spirit in me is stronger ! prepare so your emotions won t be shaken  and your demise can conquer the enemy government. get back the morals  integrity  and principles that god intended for us to be.
you continue to be the most spot on with your views... and relay them in the most intelligent  eloquent manner.  i simply adore you   your beliefs.  you re a blessing to so many  to put our thoughts   feelings into proper perspective   reinforce that we are not crazy in what we see happening.  what is crazy  is so many who do not see it!!
daniel webster was the perfect example of the impetus behind federalism. irked that he had to waste time filling out different copyright documents for each state  he endeavored for the federal umbrella that  would consolidate copyright laws which would save him time and money. the promotion of this helped with the incremental steps leading to the over reach of federal power today. if there is benefit in this to  we the people   it is only an after thought.you rock. thank you.
thank you for what you have said in this video. i keep losing close family members because they don t enjoy that i m awake to the reality of this world in its current state. and i m only 24.. it s hard out here but we have god and at the end of the day that s all that truly matters..
100  spot on.i truly appreciate you stating and emphasizing this.  to me  it is as obvious as the nose on my face.  i have a difficult time grasping how people either do not know or do not care.  i do take some solace that i am not the only one who sees what is happening.  there is encouragement in knowing that i m not alone.
patriot nurse-thank you for another insightful and informative video.you are much appreciated!!!!!
it is a burden of the heart and soul  to have seen this coming for so long and now to be seeing the rotten fruit of this multi-polarity collapse happening before our eyes.  pennsylvania and the northern panhandle of west virginia are also suffering this ecologic disaster along with ohio  for sure.  thirty miles out. in the end  god will have his way.  be prepared in all ways and for his work.  train with pn  valuable classes.
unbelievable how  they  have changed our lives. thank you for your efforts as always! god bless!
your online course sounds sooo good!!! i wish i had the extra money but  my car just broke down. i am sure that will take any saving i have. thank you for your enlightening videos.
great info thank you.  we need to find out what we can all do to put a stop to this madness if that s even possible.
thank you so much for the strength of your words   and the faith to  stand up and face the  evil.
thank you for your wisdom and insight patriot nurse!
one of the clearest and most succinct appraisals of our current situation i have heard. thank for speaking out.
patriot nurse  thank you for all that you do and for sharing this information. i certainly agree with you and i try to share it and any related information with anyone that i can. however  it can be difficult  as i m sure you know  because many people are oblivious to what is going on and  or they think that nothing like this will happen here. bless you  be safe and keep up the good work ron
appreciate you pn! well said . much respect   love an blessings always
glad you re on top of this  patriot nurse. too bad you can t get to enough of us with the true message! but  we trying!
his-story is created by the conqueror
shame she doesn t know what she s talking about most of the time.
you have done well....i have been blessed with 2 christian kids who grew into wonderful adults...god bless hang tough stay safe
your so blessed to have had that many children. my friend who is romanian  his family is large and many of the romanians i met through him are all christian s and most have at least 6-10 children.
rhode island was another important factor.  there was a turnpike from boston to new york city and people using the road  did not want to pay tolls for the maintenance.  rhode island wanted a stronger federal government to provide funding for the road  under the general notion of being necessary for the postal service.
we   my husband and i   agree with you.
yes and i agree also!this world is gone!!
patriot nurse  again u have simply just astounded us. my hubby and i have been watching your videos here on utube for more than a year! your information is incredibly educational. we admit that we don t understand everything you talk about because you are so intelligent.  but we get enough of what you say  especially the prep tips. to find it very helpful. thank you! god bless! b
my wife and i just had a discussion about this last week. i m referring to your very valid assertion that people who seek power in washington are broken and pathological. we absolutely agree with everything you say concerning what the government should be doing  as opposed to what it is doing.the country has circled back....  no taxation without representation .
patriot nurse has been one of my major sources for information  reality check  and telling it like it really is  ! i am grateful to see you back in good health and giving us the truth  ! looking forward to all your videos....
it s deeply frustrating to be awake and aware of what is happening  but not to have the funds to prepare. we have only a very small stockpile of food and with teenagers to feed  it would disappear in about two weeks if we stopped buying food at the store. and i would love to take patriot nurse s course but i have absolutely nothing left over after paying such ridiculously high prices for gas and groceries. i feel that i am really not prepared for the times ahead but i don t see how to prepare with no money.
true. it is a heavy burden to watch this  and to know what is happening. heartbreaking for patriots.
free the jan 6th political prisoners!
god bless you for telling us the truth and keeping us informed. i m praying  for you and the stress this brings .
i can t agree more the way you describe things is so accurate that gives me goosebumps. truth
yes  a very sad state of affairs in america you are an inspiration to us all to get prepared. thank you for all you do.     .
preach it pn. hope you are doing well. thanks for the video and god bless.
it s hard seeing all this going on and being on the southern border mission so far from home and not being able to protect and take care of my home. i love this country and love serving it but it kills me to see the way it s going and seeing how bad our border is. i pray the lord intervenes and helps us turn things around.
the rot in this society is being revealed. pray for wisdom.
@ patriot nurse!!  as always  thank you for what you are doing and keep the videos coming !!  god bless you!
thanks pn  always good to hear your latest...  it is the manner  in which we choose to operate. that give us the margins to persevere  when events do not go as planned ...
you are 100  correct  we need a plan.
thank you for all you do! your so right about all this!
the big guy is more than likely just trying to hide hunters wrong doings. it s not like any of them care how they let die or just  let  die.  and when you say 95  i truly feel your being way to generous.
another great video patriot nurse!thank you so much!i just love your down to earth perspective on current events!!!keep safe and pray on!!!
love your wisely common sense and your hard work.women of wisdom.god bless you
our voice of reason and understanding ! we love our patriot nurse
let s discuss i have something for you.
how many times can i like your comment
it s in the governments and high positions of powerlessness compared to  jesus christ s .
i m afraid that hunter s wrong doing is just the tip of the iceberg in ukraine.
i m blown away by the fact that our betters can just waltz into our towns  walk around  and then leave completely untouched.
i love your message you are   right i work for the government many years ago. and  if they cannot control you they have no use for you so sad
everything they do is on purpose!
right on patriot nurse!  i agree with you!
100  lady.  but you tell anybody this and they just call you crazy or a fear monger.  the cognitive dissonance that s out there amongst regular people is absolutely mind-blowing.
the sad thing about all of the people who cannot acknowledge what s going on or think that others  such as the government  will take care of them will be those that either die or get seriously taken advantage of. i ve s ent a great deal of time talking about prepping and the state of the world with people and finally had to acknowledge that most people are incapable of recognizing the situation or dealing with it...
100  exactly pn   keep doin  the best you can  you are one of a kind  taking nursing to a whole new level. thank you for all your efforts!i can t become un-awake  but after a few decades  the initial shock and horror wore off a bit as smoldering gallows humor took over.temper your passion with professional compassion  like a hospice care nurse does for those who do not wish to confront their end of life situation or specific details. yep  there will be generations of liver cancer and suffering from that oh spill  food and water .  most can t just move away from there and everyone should know the whole story  but for some  ignorance might truly be  their  bliss at this point where all the prep in the world can t save those already dosed. at least it s not a global nuclear holocaust  just yet .  don t forget about the unstoppable mutating mrna rattata that s brought about a new level of persistent global tyranny to eat out that last of our substance.   maybe it s time to just put on a happy face and pray that they don t burn the whole thing down to a radioactive cinder!  too bad  they can t seem to wake up either . maybe putin will set us all free take care of you and yours.
thank you so much @the patriot nurse. this is my second time watching your video this time i m note taking. always take notes from you. you are always teaching lady!!! thank u so very much!!!! sharing as always glad you are feeling better.
it s been like this for a very very very long time  but now it is so much more in the open. most are still inside the matrix fast asleep under mind control.
i really  really hope my question does not aggravate you. i am a subscriber and have been for a long time. i basically agree with just about everything you say. years ago i modeled and ridiculously cared about the way i looked all the time. pretty much gave that up years ago for more important things. at 55 i m mostly concerned with prepping and mountain wilderness lifestyle. i rarely wear makeup  but even though that is so  i still wanna do the bare minimum  mascara . you have incredible lashes and am curious what mascara you use  -please  everyone else  don t blast me for asking this as i know it s nowhere near the topic of this channel. and yeah  i  also know this is in no way  shape  or form a beauty channel.
this  u.s. first  person shared yet another of your videos. always informative and inspiring. i agree  it is disturbing that we are not a force for good in the world any longer. jolting admission  isn t it  the united states is in the middle of a supreme nosedive. self sufficiency  pulling back from the system as much as humanly possible seems to be the only way to live in the future. we need to live with the thought that  eventually  this grid will go down permanently  no youtube  yikes  people will have serious withdrawal  and they will have to live with whatever skills  knowledge they possess at hand. preps must include alternate energy sources for optimal survival  even a small solar array that can run a freezer or electric heater  minimal systems  will be a huge blessing. violence will escalate  as you said. god bless  cynthia  n. ga mountains
thanks youtube for the notification!y all  listen to this lady and her warnings  she knows exactly what she s talking about!!! thank you and god bless you patriot nurse
seeing you makes my day. started watching you back in 2012-2013ish. prepare people
imagine carrying the burden of truth since 1962 and just now finally getting a few people to see and realize the facts.
you are incredible patriot nurse. thank you
i m ready to take the black pill. i m getting old. it s getting too hard to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders and trying to inform the jellyfish people. great video. i ll try to hang on. this won t end well.
ma am i m not sure specifically what inspired this particular video that couldn t be said directly  but as always thank you for your efforts. you re a blessing to so very many people so don t let the enemy overwhelm you  just breath and pray knowing you have the prayers of many of us as well  god bless
agreed stayed prayed up . maranatha my brethren
04 30 i would argue that the desire to call the shots is in all of us.  we all want power.  however  part of maturity and mental health is to recognize that other people also have needs and a point of view and to learn how to cooperate  rather than  boss around .
the best video yet! truth!!! girl you say exactly how i feel and i am grateful you are sharing your voice. plzzzz keep it up and stay safe. thank you
and for evil
@morningglory3681  if by evil you mean to do us badly  you re right
@morningglory3681  absolutely right!
yes we ve been warned for decadessad to say it butsoon the laughter will turn to tears
oceanbreeze gets it. this is not about money  a fiat currency . it s about control
i first watched her vaccine vid.  excellent
interesting you would say we were prepared for this day. my spouse and i have felt that way for some time. both of us grew up feeling  out of place   with our generation  gen x . while everyone else was partying for years we were suffering. we kept waiting for god to level the playing field..... and here we are..... wow.... god s ways aren t our ways for sure!
there are more people awake and more people are learning the truth all the time.
your the best patriot nurse!  thank you for always giving us the truth! listening from indianapolis
history recalls how great the fall can bewhile everybody s sleeping  the boats put out to seaborn on the wings of timeit seemed the answers were so easy to find too late   the prophets crythe island s sinking  let s take to the skycalled the man a fool  stripped him of his prideoh  everyone was laughing up until the day he diedoh  though the wound went deepstill he s calling us out of our sleepmy friends  we re not alonehe waits in silence to lead us all homeso you tell me that you find it hard to growwell i know  i know  i knowand you tell me that you ve many seeds to sowwell i know  i know  i knowand was the holy lamb of godon england s pleasant pastures seen and did the countenance divineshine forth upon our clouded hills
so good to see you more often. be well
whew you are on a roll sweet heart love it!! ... seriously if we didn t have the strong faith in the lord we would go nuts   as most are  but the time is crucial to plan and be prepared for sure!! ... just a side note i m checking into coming to one of your classes in april  in knoxville   that s where i live  so hope to see ya soon! take care of yourself   keep up the good work!
it s a good time to be an old marine  lots of skill and no fear of a good fight  or death. molon labe!   ps  it s the 4-bs now  you have to add one for bullion.
i appreciate tremendously your bedrock analysis of  what the hell is going on!   and i fear where this is all headed.  dark ages are just ahead.  will be looking for you on the other side.   take care.
spot on like to many times!  thank you for taking your time with us today
thank you for all you do....maybe you or one of your listeners can give me an idea on my next step.....i have suffered with major hip pain for many years and it has gotten progressively worse over time.i am planning on meeting with a surgeon to discuss a hip replacement and wanted to get some input as to going through with it  banking blood from both me and my wife  share the same blood type  going around and also preventing of the m-r-n-@ vaccines or meds  we are both pureblood  and any other pitfalls i may be able to avoid...again thank you for all that you do.
thank you for your wise words. god bless. everyone be prepared. stay strong.
hi patriot nurse  i was asked a question today about why war is profitable. i explained it the best i could. i was wondering if you have or would do a video on this topic  people are waking up and for those in my small sphere  i want them to have correct information  hence why i m asking you. you truly have a way of explaining things. i appreciate you very much  god bless you!
wow  just wow. this lady is just brilliant. god bless you.
yes all of that s happened since 2008 has been planned that i can tell!
it is abhorrent how they protect such monsters.  i appreciate your work.
thank you for speaking the truth and putting it out there! we as a country are in real trouble. keep speaking truth!
loved what you said. all facts! love you girl!
wow.  patriot nurse  you re so right.  i ve got two blessed others who are not capable at this time to face what s happening.  delusional in part.very sad.  they ll either snap to it  or require care.  i don t know.  lord have mercy.
thank you for all you do.  i am the young of the baby boomers.  i gave myself 7 children  and i did my part. i m trying to be funny in these strange times!!!
i like the fact that we have to be more independent and understanding  hopefully soon a majority will become aware of what is true and what is morally important
hey fellow gen x here.i wasn t partying. i was out busting tail and now i m ready for almost anything.i m pretty much cut ties to everything.i ve also felt this way for a very long time.i m self sufficient and off grid.but im just one person. a long time ago politicians got the only person i loved killed. i ve felt the pain of what has happened for a long time. i ve wanted people to wake up for a long time. honestly  don t understand why you blame our generation. we have never had a voice. everything skip over our small generation.really..how many politicians do you see from gen x.boomers did everything to keep us out. and the next two have a hard time even admitting we are even here. sorry but we really haven t had a say.i know a lot of gen x that didn t party. thats my option. and don t think im a blame. most my life i had my nose to the grid stone. i ve just gotten sick of trying so hard for so long.   i m tired. i m tired of the young telling of thing our generation fixed a long time ago. saying it out of wack.pollution was fixed by the 1980s.equality was fixed in the 1980s. well the best its ever been or will be.our generation was the last before all this fake stuff happened. all these mass shooting fake or real. yes a lot from our generation has enforce the myth.but i say they ones that don t remember were on drugs.and speaking of drugs. the boomers   hippies stopped parting and took entery level jobs just as we were coming into the work force.  and now the old farts are not retiring. so when they do retire it will be in time for millenials. and you know they will keep us from the upper jobs. like i said i m self sufficient..im retired and it drives boomers mad. they are still paying off their house. still blowing money.i started working when i was 10.  everytime i ve worked for another. boomers and millenials control eveeything. the first job i had i wasn t the boss was the miltary.  lucky i was an entrepreneur most my life.but for many thats not an option.we have been forced out of the job markets our whole lives. i wish you all the best.
@baddog9320
@baddog9320  i m glad you didn t listen to those around you  you worked hard  and are independent from the system . i m actually kevin s wife and he worked from childhood also. he has his own remodeling business and has worked hard to build a good clientele for 20 years. i went to christian colleges when i was young and was baffled by my peers priorities and choices  it didn t give me a good impression. i understand not everyone was like that. i guess we kept getting mixed into the wrong crowd everywhere we went because the traditional church we chose after we got married was the same way. only christ got us this far.
let the games begin  i guess
@hgrimes9824  well yeah...... but this  game  is  for keeps
it s just a good time to be old i ve been fed up with this bs for a long time
let s discuss i have something for you
always leave  em laughing     smile   that ll leave  em wondering what you re up to !
you gave yourself 7 children    immaculate conception  way to go!!!!
i was number 7  of 5 brothers one sister.  dad was in world war 2 so i have wondered if we were 100 percent related.
dear pn  as always thank you for you insight!  god bless and best to you and your loved ones!
having a nation ruled by villains is getting to be a real drag.
glad to see you ll be teaching your medical prep course in utah!
this video is so on point! people don t know how the enlightenment shaped our country s view on independence of self and self determination
all of this manufactured drama is leading to one inevitable conclusion. they will burn it all down before we ever have the chance to bring them to justice. ...prepare accordingly!    anon
convention of states!!! thank you pn for reminding me about this powerful option!!!
it never ceases to be suspicious that tragedies always seem to flood the media when politicians need to get the spotlight off themselves.
thank you for all the truth!!   i much appreciate you channel and all your content!
wow! i m sorry to continue commenting  but everything you mention resonates with me. funny  i was just thinking the other day  is it better to be asleep  like the masses or awake like a fraction of us are . i follow everything that is happening around the world and i am heavily into bible eschatology  and to see how it s all connected really plays with one s mind and soul. i just keep asking myself  why can t people see what s going on  instead they are living like in the days of noah and lot.
love your videos. thanks for your  not so common sense nowadays. keep it up.
so true  it is a burden to know these things. the burden can be made lighter if you can find friends that are aware too. hopefully i can find them.
thank you so much pn.god bless you. have a great weekend.
pn- i live near a naval base in indiana.   i just heard they are shutting down gates and shipping out  supplies   that are being sent to ukraine.  this is a weapons base- rumored to hold a lot of bad stuff.    this is not confirmed but the people saying this know what s going on.
i fear it would be impossible to get rid of these corrupt rulers not leaders in a peaceful manner.makes me sick nice video
tytyty for telling us the truth!
well said patriot nurse  thank you so much for expressing exactly what i have known to be true for 50 years. so sad to see this once-great nation torn apart from within.  the freedom it once provided being turned into a weapon of mass distruction. many blessings and love to you patriot nurse.
it has always bothered me that the few control the many .
as an ohioan  thank you for the coverage  but it seems like the coverage is dying with other content creators  i wish it wouldn t. praise you pn!
i just turned 60 and i m not interested in anything the government wants to give me. i m working to be totally independent from them  meaning not collecting ss when the time comes   paying for my own health insurance.
you are 100 percent correct. we are in the last days of our great country. strong on the outside  weakness and corruption from the inside.
right on!
right here seems like a good start.
@thepatriotnurse i think your account got hacked.
for assistance offer s
great content. keep it coming. we need this. god blessings upon you
you are so correct! thank you for standing up and declaring this ugly truth we are forced to live!
they are sending some of the contaminated water to harris county  tx  that s our county!!!i am beyond disgusted and quite concerned about the future  accident  that will happen here!!
4 00 it honestly blew my mind once i was in the military how many people didn t join to honorably serve and protect the weak. those types are actually quite rare unfortunately
you are exactly right  it is a burden.. to be awake  alert  and oriented.-rt girl
hello i am glad i came across your youtube channel late last night i just could not sleep maybe i was bothered with all the things that are happening in our country we must continue to pray     and repair this is just the beginning of wants to come.
girl you were made for social media! the speed you talk amazes me! short videos  full of meat  are where it s at!keep it up!
you are right on with your points! truth is lacking in the world today! the world has too few people controlling too much!
always leaning on yeshua! no quit. trust and faith forward. thank you patriot nurse gb ml
patriot nurse the thing i love about you the most is your powerful spirit i wish every woman in the world was just like you your  literally 1 in a billion we need celtic warrior woman with strength of conviction and beauty like i have never seen keep up the good fight
you are sooo insightful pn always well worth listening to what s on your mind. i agree  let s stay prayed up for sure  we need god s favor. much love
it hurts to see..and be told not gonna happen!!!!..no way they can cope..im trying ..youre spot on..woa im glad to hear...you.thank you
i m very grateful for the anointing you have!  may yahweh continuously guide and protect you! baruch hashem!
i am loving all this chaos  i am on the last chapter of this long life. what a better way to see my time end than to take the whole out with me.
i think it s gonna work out better that you think after a lot of pain. history shows us how things swing. the chaff separated from the wheat.
you are an amazing person..i see the work that the most high has done with you
you are an amazing woman! your insight is most helpful!
another  spot on  video!!! thank you for all you do!!! god bless!!
patriot nurse  thank you very much for speaking the truth. have a beautiful and blessed weekend. lord god bless and stay vigilant.
your knowledge of the anti-federalists is stunning.   you clearly didn t learn that in public school.  later in life  i realized the consistent theme throughout our history books in public school was that without a strong federal government  we would be doomed.
really
howdy from austin. i can t believe they are trying to spread it faster! i pray i m just being paranoid .
yes it s coming to houston  tx
@brightspacebabe9040  i just heard it on the radio this morning. perhaps check khou and abc13 news channels online for info. this morning the dj s were acting like it was something to be excited about because a houston company is going to help!!they acted like everyone was back during desert storm when red adair was going to fight the oil well fires!!!crazy!!!
burnet county here. what do you mean they are  sending   in barrels or containers  and why  i hate to say this but if you follow the water ways from the accident site this contamination is bound to make its way into the ohio river and then to the mississippi -- which flows straight into the gulf. i will not be eating any gulf shrimp anymore  and that s a huge staple down here in tx.
yes  it will be processed in deer park where i used to live. i was gone well before the itc fire in 2019 but i still have friends and family there.
i just learned of this from another channel.  very disturbing!!!!!
i heard it was sent a week ago  it s a suburban area
@rebecca-vl3rx  it is straight up urban and refineries
@texasmamabear9651  thank you  i heard harris county texas.
@rebecca-vl3rx  yes it is
the contaminated water is traveling by trains and trucks on the highways... what could possibly go wrong with that !  and consider where that water would go if a hurricane floods the city or a wreck happens during transport and will it drain into the gulf from galena park   smh... mary greely has a pretty good video about it.
how   why   who is sending contaminated water to you
@evechavez2089  how are they sending contaminated water
squirreltribe did a great video on that today.
i m nearby.  hello neighbor.  it s always nice to know informed people live nearby.
well  if it takes 20 or 30 years most of us will be dead. so there s that. personally i d like to be able to enjoy a few more years of freedom and prosperity before i m shipped off to shady acres.
history does repeat itself. nero is in the house. caligula is pulling his strings.
great video. lots of great observations and dots to connect. we have lots of corruption going on in our govt as well  so no judgment there. i will admit though  i m stuck on the  america won ww2  comment... ouch.
people will not speak the truth like you speak  love hearing the words you bring out
thanks for all that you do
pn --you made my night ..your wonderful smile when even talking about the burden of knowing ....you are a very smart lady who totally gets it....hand salute ...god bless
it s frustrating trying to prep when you can t make ends meet  and loved ones aren t interested in joining me.
consider a potential land grab by the epa as they may use property liens against any person entity to recover any funds spent to mitigate toxins on any property. in turn  revaluing homes  farms  businesses  etc. if the bill can t or won t be repaid by the property owner. just something to consider.
always love your message i agree with you 100    all of us be safe
thank you ! i m thankful for your valuable insights . god bless you!
this admin wants us to fall fail...they are intentionally doing everything they are doing to our hurt.
your message is right on point you are amazing for your truth
i agree with what your sharing. how much has this to do with  it being another step toward the draft to sign over our sovereignty in coming days. i know that is another topic that probably won t be tolerated on this platform but i do wonder. a lot is getting ready to change in a huge way. we have to keep preparing and be able to feed and take care of ourselves. have the best weekend
amen pn! our world in america is sadly all but gone from what it was created to be so many years ago.  i just pray the lord either brings a great revival over our nation or just come with the rapture! father  please consume our land
very well and bravely said patriot nurse.
thanks  sister. keep up the good work.
the  enlightenment  is what got us in this mess in the first place. what we are experiencing is the inevitable conclusion of it.
thank you. louis another great story. may god bless you and keep you safe.
you are so right pn.  it is a burden  but we must battle the evil.  pray.  the power of prayer can change the world.  when we pray  god takes over.
god bless you @thepatriotnurse. also  thank you so much for what you do  it is truly appreciated.
bless you for sharing your knowledge! but you are not alone. this burden is shared and we are praying and sitting up on that wall with you.
whats really sad is they cannot use that property in ohio due to it being poisoned!
@hopeking3588  think much bigger! where did the toxic plume travel to     the toll will be steep in economic  health and lives lost.... the tally is just starting.
intel corp
@sl4983  what are you asking
@jackwalsh1468  and they did the burn on a predicted very windy day.
i m pretty sure that the endgame is nationalization of the railroads.   engles laid that out as one of the principals in his 1847 document
yes  yes!!!!!   with  a desolating  extinction   by   nuclear   fire   !!!!!!
thank you for all that you do.
you are always refreshing thankyou patriot nurseshabbat shalom blessings prayers from alaska
it truly is a burden. one i m finding harder and harder to carry.
another patriot who comes to mind in harmony with your articulate spoken word and analysis of the reality of our situation is none other than the founder of the american view  an american view of law liberty and government  micheal anthony peroutka
i am awake  pn. i am not in a position to store up anything. i am an older one women home. i pray. my answer  i pray. i listen to everything you say and i am in full agreement. god speed.
you re correct. we have these discussions frequently at home in milwaukee.
bless you pn. truth is always good to hear.
i live in gothenburg  nebraska where we just had our 3rd train derailment in 6 months  all on the same section of track.  it was only coal  but they had at least 15 backhoes out there trying to clean it up.  we re 35 miles from the largest rail yard in the world.
great job and god bless you all
thank you. will there be any more medical prep teachings to come
amen.  it is a burden to see the truth.  i ve been saying this forever. i don t want that responsibility anymore.
that is always the challenge for good people  understanding how the wicked can do the things they do  as these actions go against the very nature of the righteous.
you are one of the few people that has a clear vision of what s going on. most other youtuber  etc.  still hold onto the idea that if we elect the right guy  things will change. as abe lincoln  or jfk  or yassir arafat  or yitzak rabin  anyone else that goes against the tide. trump may face the same fate  if he persists  or he is just a diversion.
speaking the truth! god bless you sister
thank you patriot nurse!  you are a gifted thinker and speaker we need to stop paying income tax!
the sooner the brain dead wake up to this truth you speak  the sooner we can be about our father s buisiness.
thank you for all your hard work
sad but still beats living in ukraine. let s go  brandon!
pn  i have found this video to be one of the best  informative  and inspiring videos you have produced in a while. straight to the point. no sugar coating. frank. and delivered powerfully and confidently. thank you!!
you re absolutely right patriot nurse  in saying that the usa is no longer a forfe for good in the world.  and that s a painful reality but one we must face.  it truly hurts deeply to make that realization
i would recommend getting a bible and read  and trust god
i m saying prayers for you too  vicki.
that s why they say that ignorance is bliss  because it is.
great message and it rings true lady patriot!
you speak truth and common sense. thank you .we are in the last days i believe. until we are taken home  we must occupy. when the spirit is removed  evil will have its way .for a while
i see it. and agree. keep praying. eternal life is what counts in the end. also of course do best you can while we re still here.
thank you patriot nurse
thank you patriot nurse for your prayers and labor of  love
perfectly stated. carry on madam.
hello patriot nurse  i just read on the gateway pundit  that jill biden expects that brandon will announce that he s running again for 2024 sometime in april. she went on to say  that  he has done so much  that he shouldn t stop now. yes  really.
thank you for your work  words and dedication.   may god bless you.   wendy in ohio.
tyranny has been a slow progression in the us for a long time. waking up to it now has to be mind blowing.
keep up the great work!!
thanks for your message and guidance... i think you re spot on.
little squirrel told me that there s cobalt mines in southern oh  northern pa. it would be awfully convenient if the property value dropped so land was cheaper to buy for the company s who need raw materials to make batteries for evs. speaking of the big guy taking advantage of the little guy.
when you control the counting of ballots  you don t have to worry about what your citizens think about the way you govern.
pn  i think the description for politicians you may have been looking for is    morally bankrupt and spiritually destitute  which is right on the mark!!
everyone who watch this full video got the whole truth and nothing but the truth
you are correct.  it s all about power and retaining it  no matter the consequences.
history repeating itself! we are the same as the entertained masses at the coliseum.
6 total major derailments in less than 2mos. this is unreal   concerning on many levels. -ny
listening to you feels like a breath of fresh air.  !!!
we all think we are more than we are    but life is never as bad as we think  always a way out   and we are never as good as we think
well  he s has done alot. alot of things he should be impeached and put in prison for.
i think the ideal police situation is to have different police forces for different political parties and sects that only enforce laws that were elected. that way  people arent  peer pressured  by society into enforcing laws that go against their conscience. as far as rebellion against unfairly elected laws  like huge changes overnight like its nothing  unfair elections  or lies  for example  a covid vaccine mandate...  i think the best situation is to admit you are willing to use lethal self defense until they change their mind on force vaccinating you against your will or they let you move to a sanctuary state. but i think that threat to life and bodily autonomy is gone because they lifted the vaccine mandate for government and military workers already.
thank you for your voice. love your messages!
no matter how rotten this world is  you still look good!
the most high has raised you up for a time as this. you have so much wisdom an knowledge of so much an i love your insight with so much truth. thank you so much
good topic  the commerce clause is one of the few enumerated powers of the federal government. it is about the only one they cannot overreach on...
well girl  once again  i concur 100  ...i wish i had other kindred spirits in my life..... everyone thinks i m nuts  i just don t understand how most people can t see this world for what it is...i think  being a seasoned entrepreneur coupled with a life of chaotic episodes allows us to see  what sheeple can t...to know enough to know that submission to nature  and god s way is the only sustainable way... everything else is doomed.
i m sure you know this but states around ohio are now having what looks like weird snow like dust that is super thick and sticks to cars and windows etc. some are saying it smells funny scary god be with us all
young lady  you are a true patriot. thank you! we are blessed  matthew 5  to live in such a time as this.
i agree 100   long time sub  of you and your husband. i got out the military in 2009  and i  am not rich  but i have been preparing.
i d love to see you on the view lolis it a cop out to wanna go  home    i m so ready so ready.love you pn!
its a scary time but a nation is only as strong as its people and the more aware and wise the people are  the better they ll thrive whether they call that nation rome or the united states. god bless and prayers to the people of palestine ohio
you re the definition of brave. not some quadruple-boosted  sexually confused  narcissistic  deviant. scones or canolis on me. delightful  enlightening conversation is on you.
thank you for another fine video  much appreciated.
i posted yesterday about our 3rd train derailment in gothenburg  nebraska.  now we re up to 4!  there are 30 train cars full of phosphorus on fire about 5 miles further down the track from the first derailment right now!
speaking facts as usual!
really studying the history  we never were a force for  good   we did help some along the way but it was always  the ends justifies the means   in our favor.
thanks for the chat patriot nurse  much appreciated.....truthspeak is golden......00tg from illinois......
sad state of events.  god help our country.
i feel prepared  mentally  physically and spiritually. breaks my heart that people i try to wake up are not ready! my best friend always says that if shtf she is coming over to my house. wtf  i keep telling you to stock up!
your so scarily right. our nation is unrecognizable.
nope but  remember jesus said  . i am  the way  the truth and the life no one can go to the father except through me.
remember the deagel report  u s population 99 million by 2025. are they on  track . food for thought
thank you  young lady. you re amazing.
i appreciate your channel   god bless!
please share this video far and wide!!!
thank you pn - you get it  stay focused knowing the win of our father in heaven -
check  check and check of prep! we all knew what was coming. we all listened. we all saw it coming for years. help others when the crazy hits  help others before it does.
thank you! i m kinda tired and i really needed to hear this.
it s nearly time  we all feel it.
thank you for preaching to their choir! it didn t use to be but now politicians when elected only seek to  get re elected !
nice to meet a fellow deborah  amazing times we are living in
this is beautiful. everything falling into place as jesus said it would. above all  keep your lamps full of oil. we ll get to see these dictators  plea to have the mountains fall on them. jesus said  vengeance is mine but  he didn t say we couldn t watch as he destroys our enemies on the return. this is the fig tree generation. we are the disciples who if asked the lord again  will you at this time restore the kingdom to israel   we would definitively hear him say  yes!!!! hold on  bride  our husband is coming to take us where he has prepared a place for us and then the millennial reign where righteousness will rule!!
well said! thank you!
thank you pn. always on point.
the immediate answer is for citizens across the country to step up and help. that s the only help they are going to get.
thanks pn. excellent video. you are a gift from our lord   savior.
we must keep waking up the people!
we can see you  are very concerned it shows in your  face.its sucking your energy.pleasr take it easy give yourself a  break  we need you  in this  fight.dont let what is  going on  destroy you much love peace
you are absolutely correct!!!!and they call us crazy!!!
ya im on ssi and smdisabled! i caught on to prepping! 8 years old then it was a little garden on my patio! most people here dont prepp food and water like i do! i just had caterack surgrey it i can see much better now.glad i did it b4 the shift!
thank you again beautiful  for your insight. i have researched the jesuits for some time now  and it seems like the results of there influence in the politics of a god fearing country. maybe the reason they have been kicked out of many other countries!! good work blessed soldier.
the cataract surgery helped
been a sub for years and years. good words  good words.
no kidding. they ve been doing all kinds of atrocities on purpose for decades.
they do not love themselves therefore they will not love anyone nor will they ever know or have unconditional love for anything! can you imagine    such a sad state of affairs very sad. thank the holy father that we are not one of them and we never will be ! praise the lord!
will agree it is the very face of the absurd what is being perpetrated on us...
amen   so very true
don t be scared  be prepared!! when this war really kicks off you will need every prep you ve purchased. and finally trust in the lord!  don t let yourself be led astray by the things of this world
sister  in full swing agreement with you. god bless.
i got saved in 1988. ez 33 7 was deeply impressed upon me.  seeing the truth and knowing we ve been foretold everything should give us peace. we have been warned over and over by watchmen.  we are to walk in love. not fear.  be ready. have oil in your lamps  and be ready to flee to the hills.  god will guide and protect his elect.  never fear. thank you pn.  maybe it s something to do with being a nurse. we assess  plan  execute and evaluate.  do we become nurses because we are imbued with the watchman spirit or become watchman because we are trained to see things   i don t know  but it s time we cling to our family of faith and be prepared.
local and state governments had no clue that water and soil contamination would be moving to the state of michigan.
netflix had a movie last year called white noise  was exactly what happened in east palistine ohio. totally in our faces.

thank you for your reporting
hi patriot nurse. my sons are new nurses who have watched your channel for years. would your courses enlighten their knowledge further
agree  this is way beyond suspicious.
well said nurse!! well said indeed.  good call.
guys also need to be aware of the finalizing of a treaty next week over at the united nations that would give it  through the world health organization  power to circumvent the sovereignty of its member states and dictate laws on our healthcare whether we like it or not.  and the wording of the treaty would prevent any legislator from being able to override it.  a country would basically  if it passes  be forced to either comply  or exit out of being a member.
thank you patriot nurse!!
god bless you.patriot nurse
interstate commerce was greatly expanded by the wheat case decided in roosevelt packed court which resulted in many federal departments being created
thank you for your insight.
one of the best channels on the tube.
remember pompeii   i just re-watched dente s peak  1997 .  the one scientist  volcanologist  was right about when the volcano was going to blow.  i have pizza on fridays and watch a movie.  i m watching star trek picard.  they are trying to repair the timeline.  remember q   he s messing stuff up.  i m on s2e6    i get a frozen pizza  saves so much money
i don t know if you realize it pn but very few orators can equal rush limbaugh. you have the knowledge  intelligence  ability and attractiveness to be a popular radio   tv program host. your caliber easily commands  200 000 to  500 000 a year and like a sports baller you get a contract listing your bumps  bonuses and riders.you are one awesome lady. thank you.
amen- yes!! @patriot nurse!!
more people need to say out loud that there is no way our ivy league educated leaders are actually as stupid as the things they do. it is deliberate.
a small and limited government is essential!
i figured about 99  of them are corrupt some time ago  you re being too kind.
yep  when rome was questioned by the people  they created the coliseum. entertain the people so people don t see what they re doing. people faught to the death they had a circus where lions ate the prisoners. and people loved it. we have the same coliseum  only it s called the stadium. evil loves when we compete against each other in every way
patriot nurse   the acoustics on your videos are best when filmed in your car like this one and others. when filmed in your house or office your audio is not near as clear. thank you for your words of wisdom .
to the the governments  peace is a problem to be  solved  and only war can do that.
god bless the world love and caring for one and each other is community that will make the difference
we can t even take care of our own problems.
these people are evil!
finally someone else who has a good head on their shoulders
hello patriot nurse  been a while since i chimed in.  thanks. i have known what s going on for 40years. seen it all coming.  god s in control.  as jesus said   cheer-up for i have overcome the world.under god only are we united people as one family.  my love to all. former  u.s. marine vietnam vet 0311    remember we originate with god  but the whole world lies in the power of the wicked one.   it s in governmental places of authority.
they sure aren t doing this accidentally.
the only reason why i can handle it is because of jesus christ. thank you pn for standing up and speaking truth. i ve been saying that it s on purpose and people think i m crazy. thank you for just confirming what i was thinking.
you have no idea what it s like to know what i know    bill cooper
corruption s been running rampant for decades with no accountabilitywhat could possibly go wrong
@spaceindian3769  i think we re about to find out very soon.

this afternoon 3pm p.t.  jim
just as with rome as an empire  the doors of the temple of janus were closed for only a few months in the 500 year history of that entity. so here  we have been free of foreign wars for only a few months  at most. if i recall correctly  that is. otherwise  only a few years.
i absolutely love your soul! the lord s blessings be upon you
preparedness requires an honest evaluation of our blindspots  not just physical and intellectual  but spiritual. may our lord open all our eyes to truth  and give us his grace for the battle. ... god bless you
yes ma am they are doing this on purpose.
you re awesome.  you get it.
agree completely!!
3 21 amen. we need the other people to wake up before it s too late. i hope see it now with ohios treatment.

you re finally getting it. this is all by design
thank you pn!
dear pn  you nailed it!
truth keep it up girl it s time for us to wake up america
the gateway pundit has an article about  the east palestine fire department handing out my id medical tracking and monitoring devices one week before the derailment!
you are so gifted  virtuous and brave. thankyou for giving us your thoughts. i agree with all you ve said. we are living in desperate times. just like the days of noah- we re just about there. yes we need to prepare the best we can. but this battle can seem too strong for us.  we all need the peace of god  and to remember we are not alone.may we all experience a strong dose of peace and caring about others in this time. i know i can be so selfish. please pour out your holy spirit on us. help the people in palestine. you say lord  you  ll never leave us or forsake us.
i don t think any of us are truly ready for what s about to happen  but with jesus  we can be. thank you for the good words and leadership. have a blessed day
correct on all counts  god bless you.
yes patriot nurse!   ..!    thank you for bring ing enlightenment  and truth and knowledge  to  the people of the united states.    most people are asleep.   you are so very intelligent and articulate.   i pray....america first.   stay out of other countries.   dear  god.   keep our soldiers and weapons at home.   this is a frightening  time in history.   tip of the iceberg.  lord  help us.
you are 1000  correct!!!
i m right there with ya young lady! keep up the outstanding work! watch your six and don t accept any wooden nickles......i also live in middle tennessee.

they chose to be  woke  not awake.   it s a responsibility they will be forced to carry.
planned   by design
you have got to be kidding  !! even the fire department was in on it!
also the program is indirectly owned by experian
you are fantastic  my patriot sister.
i want to be in your tribe  patriot nurse. lead us!
perhaps the admin is trying to secure allies for the time when it s own people declare enough.
its sad but what you are saying is the truth .
worked at the hazardous waste facility where that stuff goes and i ll tell you right now a tyvek is not proper ppe
i never understood that famous clip of jack nickelson yelling  you can t handle the truth!  but now i do.

absolutely agreed! the roman empire is in full throttle!
it is pass time to reclaim this country. if we don t do this our children and following generations will suffer. these criminals need to be removed
snap out of it!!!   i appreciate this rant.
when patriot nurse said instagram at 9 13 i swear she was looking straight at me! don t call us out like that pn!
all very true!    god help us!
you made me cry because you hit the nail on the head!!!
if you look at the dispersal of that cloud  you ll see it traveling into upstate ny state.  i have relatives there that said the sky was hazy.  what about everyone down wind

there is something to be said for sending them all home  every agency all the way down to the janitors  every 20   30 years or so ... and ... have some consanguinity rules to prevent nepotism  puppet-nephews and puppet-cousins  etc. .
god bless y all
personally  i think all this break down and insanity is the direct correlation to the curses like spelled out in leviticus 26 for turning our back on him.
i have a question. how can anybody not love you  i can say  that in a different life  i would have aligned myself in your orbit  no matter any difficulty.  you are so intelligent.  so well rounded  you believe and worship our lord and have given of yourself  for so little return. a beautiful person. of course  you are. god makes no mistakes.
patriot nurse  god bless you.      spread the truth.   beans   bullets     bandaids.         scary times.
always spot on.

narcissistic nut jobs  love it
you are preaching to the choir sister....we have been reading these between the lines for years.they have perfected the art of blaming your opponents for doing the same as your doing....
dear pn totaly offtopic but what i really miss is you reading from the book of psalms. i had to stay up untill 4 in the morning but it was such a blessing always. take care and god you.
totally agree!!
in case you didn t know patriot lady  the governor refused help and did not want anyone down there til he investigated it. after two weeks he changed his mind.
de-pop  control are the main goals.
you too
that is a fact !
love your description   narcissistic nut jobs  which   lo and behold there in dc great  point about anti-federalism  i wish we can get your mouth in dc somewhere. i can see you and bobert and green kicking butt!
you nailed it! bread and circuses!
well put. !!!
i did not craft myself. god has been ever present in seeing to it that i survive.  heaven knows why  but time and again he saved my bottom  sent the lessons and prepared me.  same for my hubs.  we are here as wise old boomers by his grace.
what your opinion on the explosions in bedford  the metal plant  and if it is toxins  they are doing nothing there
money   they seek the power for all the control  wealth!
i was taught bye my grandpa that if this country of ours  u.s.  if we ever go dark like the nazi s .we will be the darkest nation ever   so sad it looks more and more like my grandpa was correct  he told me this in 1974 . glad he isn t here to witness this   rip grandpa now i m the grandpa and i m teaching my grandchildren

from south africa  going to mail you for information on the training etc... thank you so much
thank you for the truth
spot on pn.
if anyone hasn t  they should read 1984 and atlas shrugged. i have long been of the opinion that we must limit the time that anyone can work for the government  ten years at most  with no pensions. the only exceptions should be members of the uniformed military. that wouldn t solve everything by a long shot  but it would be a start.
for me it comes through god and right now we are seeing a revival and a lot of peoples eyes are going to be open praise the lord
you are right in that we are living in a repeat of the roman empire.  it fell by all the things that we ll fall by  we can look to the history of rome to see what will happen here.
indiana is on the ohio as well. my parents live 9 miles from the ohio river and their household water still comes from it.
i believe god will only give you what you can handle. apparently he thinks   actually knows  i can handle alot. i often wonder why i am here. i ve come to realize that it s   i think  to try to wake people up and tell them what s going on. i ve been through a things that alot of people couldn t deal with  one is the suicide of my son. i wouldn t have made it without god in my life. other things that have made me wiser hopefully   toughened me up so i don t whine when people call me all kinds of names and turn away from me  etc. i m the only one in my family who didn t get the . my whole family! half my family aren t prepared and getting prepared for what s coming. so i m trying to prep for them the best i can with what little i have. it s time to toughen up  speak up  pay attention because it s only getting worse. and alot of people are not gonna be able to handle what they will finally have to pay attention to.
love you best when you get angry and passionate. love you all the time.god bless from texas.
o how i enjoy watching u speak to me. no one knows but i  the one and the energetic realms of truth and her reality...
well put!!!
this may seem quite  off the subject  however  this is an observation by a  relitively young  american patriot.we see through the lies of the current administration  how can we stop them we have two years left....
i agree with everything you just said
the problem is that the us is not a nation with a government but a corporation with a management. the goal is growth and profit  the means is their assets  resources and economic strategy. they already own the us and europe and hold the rest hostage. they are loosing their grip now and act like the high school bully who has gotten beat up for the first time. now the whole school is lining up for a pass.
amen preach girl!
can we talk about what we are not supposed to talk about  someone told us a few years ago  he would conduct his third term from the basement. smells a lot like him taking it from where he left off.
yeah  i can t see any future for myself  have stated it many times on many channels  the only future i could see is if we collapse  then i could work for a future  but right now  inflation through the roof  you can t afford your own place  and if you can you re in debt forever paying it off. so i no longer try to succeed at anything  just waiting for the end. it will be terrible  but i can so no other way out.
good lord! i love your rants!
you got this my friend
no matter what. we have paradise to look forward to. everything is in the lord s hand s. we are his little children! but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me  it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck  and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.        matthew 18 6 kjv
i been watching for 4 years.love your brain  showed your video to my husband. he has a crush on you... i asked why  he said  because you re strong like me. what a great compliment.. always listening.have a great.. everything
here lately  i am starting to see why america does not have a large presence  if any  in the tribulation. feels like things are getting put in their place.
thank you pn!!!
what is sad is that it takes understanding other cultures and histories as well as your own to have a meaningful dialogue and exchange of ideas  and this is lost on many who attempt to  enlighten convert  others.   democracy  has to be learned and the values that are required to make it work have to be understood and to be valued by the culture that is incorporating that form of governance. i do not think that the  enlightenment  is the only path to a representative government. in non-western cultures  there are values that will bend towards a representative government when they find and explore the principles underlying the development of the constitution of the united states  and understand how they can incorporate them into their path ahead. it is taking the belief in god  creator  granted rights to humanity and balancing them with religious beliefs and dogma  and then implementing them in a political-economy that is congruent with the cultural religious values of the nation that is establishing itself  that will succeed in creating a representative government that will allow the greatest freedom for all members of that nation. again  this is all dependent upon the nation being built to value freedom for all and acceptance of different faiths  as the faiths generally are the sources of the most sacred of values for individuals.
we are millions in number  they are hundreds.
excellent  shabbat shalom
our god is in the contemporary discipline stage against such organizations. in may of last year  i encountered antifa at work in portland oregon. me and my husband and i are in our 60s working as security officers  low wagers  desiring to retire  prayers  please.  my husband has been physically attacked by drug abusers while working many times during the last few years. fentanyl smoke is common in buildings our  taxes  paid for. 85  of the impoverished suffer while 15  are demonized and are rewarded for evil behavior. our god-given rights of self-defense and liberty are being confronted. god is unquestionably merciful. his glory prevails. every knee will bow to him!
love ya girl
you go girl
i love this woman!
you are 100  right
the potato is not as feeble as he seems. they declared war on conservatives or might i say non supporters. i don t know why people underestimate them.

great video!  so many have forgotten jefferson and the anti-federalists!!!!
beans  bullets  bandages  bandaid tm  is a brand   and i agree with another commentator  bullion.  problem is going to be where to keep it.  there at least two ways any property can be taken from you  lawfully   taxes and imminent domain.  of course now we see that there is a third  devaluation due to poisoning.
ty for sharing yourself with me.
your energy does have an effect on me and i do agree with you about some things. people don t listen. they are asleep. a lot of what is in the bible is recurrent patterns  like chaos theory. your anger is a result of frustration.
thank you patriot nurse.
stay safe
your so bad ass .. carry on .. xoxoxoox from alaska

this is where were at and it s the last few plays before america is totally gone. her time is up  sadly due to greedy  soulless politicians and complaisant  selfish citizens. we are too far divided to save her. it was always her fate just like all past great powers.
you are a very intelligent women and i enjoy listening to you with my coffee
we live in houston and the mayor told us today that 1 2 a million particulates from ohio made its way to us and they expect 2 million
this is the nature of things     very true. sad but inevitable. roman empire 101.
imagine this we have taken on a battle that has been fought over and over again and have lost to over and over again throughout time! we are now on the cusp of defeating the most powerful fallen angel of all who has been king of our earth for thousands of years! this is the most amazing time to be alive and making our stand in the name of the most high father the creator of all things and the christ s spirit that is every one of us! we are so close to the finish line and remember we have already won this battle everything else just needs to play itself out. the whole world is about to unite in the biggest celebration like nothing before has ever happened!! this evil will never repeat itself ever again! give yourself a big hug and love yourself for being here at this time because you have chosen to be here to finish this spiritual battle once and for all! thank you sister for all your hard work and who you are and much love to you and to everyone else!
i remember you everyday in my prayerlife.
it s insanity what s going on in government
excellent rant!
well said
we are going into the abyss
100  100  100  100  100   have i made myself clear  you are on point!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pray!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the fact that ppl are blaming this on an administration just goes to show how utterly blind and naive we truly are
they want the cobalt under the tracks for the chip manufacturing plants  and black rock and vanguard have a large interest in this. and they do not want anyone there  to take any water from that area  because they need a lot of water for them plants.
as an honorably discharged veteran and former staunch conservative i can honestly say that i get warm fuzzies every time i see capitalism fail. or more accurately  what capitalism has morphed into.
i agree. places like russia and asia and the middle east are in capable of democracy so we just need to focus on ourselves and leave them to destroy themselves.

i haven t verified this yet but i m hearing that beginning may 2023 laws governing agenda 2030 land development allows governments to cease polluted land and move their residents to smart cities... oogle seems to be restricting me from researching much about it on my end. has anyone else heard about this
a visitor from the pasti had a dream the other night i didn t understand a figure walking through the mist  with a flintlock in his hand.his clothes were torn and dirty  as he stood there by my bed he took off his three-cornered hat  and speaking low he said  we fought a revolution to secure our liberty we wrote the constitution  as a shield from tyranny.for future generations  this legacy we gave in this  the land of the free and home of the brave.the freedom we secured for you  we hoped you d always keep but tyrants labored endlessly while your parents were asleep your freedom gone  your courage lost  you re no more than a slave in this  the land of the free and the home of the brave.you buy permits to travel  and permits to own a gun permits to start a business  or to build a place for one.on land you believe you own  you pay a yearly rent although you have no voice in choosing how the money s spent.your children must attend a school that doesn t educate your moral values can t be taught  according to the state.you read about current  news  in a very biased press you pay a tax you do not owe  to please the irs.your money is no longer made of silver or of gold you trade your wealth for paper  so like can be controlled.you pay for crimes that make our nation turn from god to shame you ve taken satan s number  as you ve traded in your name.you ve given government control to those who do you harm.so they can padlock churches  and steal the family farm.and keep our country deep in debt  put men of god in jail harass your fellow countryman while corrupted courts prevail.your public servants don t uphold the solemn oath they re sworn your daughters visit doctors so children won t be born.your leaders ship artillery and guns to foreign shores and send your sons to slaughter  fighting other people s wars.can you regain your freedom for which we fought and died or don t you have the courage  or the faith to stand with pride are there no more values for which you ll fight to save or do you wish your children to live in fear and be a slave sons of the republic arise and take a stand!defend the constitution  the supreme law of the land!preserve our republic and each god-given right!and pray to god to keep the torch of freedom burning bright! as i awoke he vanished  in the mist from whence he came his words were true  we are not free  and we have ourselves to blame.for even now as tyrants trample each god-given right we only watch and tremble  too afraid to stand and fight.if he stood by your bedside in a dream while you re asleep and wonder what remains of your right he fought to keep.what would be your answer if he called out from the grave  is this still the land of the free and home of the brave  thelen paulk  1986
you are so right
well  the thing about the new roman empire  is that just like the old one it s going to have to burn to the ground and fall. i mean hells bells we even use the imperial roman eagle as our symbol. i love eagles don t get me wrong  but there s only so many times you can recycle a symbol. hitler did it. now our country has done it. you are right patriot nurse we are indeed living in the third iteration of the roman empire. nothing wholly about it though. as a friend of mine from east tennessee said we are not going to be able to do anything to stop them in fact  we are just going to sit back and watch them continue to follow their trajectory towards failure and watch them fall. we don t need to tear anything down. we will just wait for them to crash and then we will build something new up.
question  what kind of people vote them in   we should look to ourselves and repent of falling into their deception.  believing their false doctrines.
one of the main reasons was because ohio voted heavily for president trump  but we see who s behind it
nurse you would benefit from global spiritual revolution channel.  you need this for even better  understanding of the players.
where did the train car full of chemical come from who produced it that s what we would like to know  thank you for your information.

where were you when t was declaring take the guns first then do the due process later  if they do it at all   and so on... or the usmca for that matter  passed under t  and even then the senate was banging the rururu drum in literally the next breathe after the 89-10 vote  or that dh et al were banging the t no tpp mantra right up until the very last  as well. for starters.

helping ohio doesn t help joe cover his sons tracks.
make no mistake  shtf is about too take place. just be careful.
i ve been saying all of this since 1979. it s not a conspiracy theory. it s not alarmism. it is merely the inescapable conclusion when one studies history  politics and human nature. do your homework! examine the fourth turning  tytler cycle  etc. then do the things! prepare as best you can.may the great god in heaven bless y all!
i wish i could give multiple thumbs up.

it sure looks that way.
patriot nurse is my spirit animal.
pn is right on smart lady very savvy. beautiful woman thanks for reports.
obiden said it was safer to ship by train. that s why the keystone pipeline was shut down and warren buffet who owns the train companies can keep making billions.. hmmm how s that safer thing working out
well  we were supposed to have a representative government!!!
i am a  boomer  and always believed that social security and medicare need to go.  i would  even at my relatively advanced age  would vote to do away with them as a starting place.  let me worry about my finances and health needs.  get gov t out of it and everything will be more affordable.  get rid of welfare medicaid at the federal level and let states decide on what safety net they want for their residents.   all this needs to change asap...all in my naive and humble opinion.  maybe we need a nationwide strike  of almost everything  until the govt. screams  uncle .   how about  occupy the usa
well said.
gave are weapons to the talabain to sell to ukraine.

protect yourself and trust in the lord with all your heart
history repeats when a nation looses sight of god.
nurse  been tossing this out there in comments and emails for over 3 weeks now  succinctly    east palestine was on purpose.
no  we are not a force for good for the world. however   americans who are believers in yeshua still help in missions and sharing the gospel.  god s blessings still flow on this country because of the faith of believers. we need as a country of citizens a massive revival!!!
1. get out of the cities. 2. seas and de seas  all forms of financial support  that includes taxes as well. 3.become self sufficient  not as a person or family  but as a group  village  or town.  4. organize yourself in defense units. they are criminals  supported by criminals. enjoy your life. even if you don t personally make it  your children will. otherwise our kids will become their slaves. we can live perfectly fine without their management  or supervision. have no fear.
no one on youtube has been able to articulate our country s condition as well as you.  some come close  but you express yourself like your reading from a future written highly detailed history book.
patriot nurse  rules
to be honest  im starting to get a little freaked out. trying to remind myself that god is in control and to trust in him.
i do not know if i can handle it  but i am very angry with what i see going on!
beware of proud voter slaves  they know what is best  they demand obedience  thank them for their service!  if you wish to keep slaves  you must have all kinds of guards. the cheapest way to have guards is to have the slaves pay taxes to finance their own guards. to fool the slaves  you tell them that they are not slaves and that they have freedom. you tell them they need law and order to protect them against bad slaves. then you tell them to elect a government. give them freedom to vote and they will vote for their own guards and pay their salary. they will then believe they are free persons. then give them money to earn  count and spend and they will be too busy to notice the slavery they are in.
there is a disconnect among americans and other democratic nations where they don t realize that your constitutional rights and everything that safeguarding them doesn t necessarily need democracy in order to flourish. local government is generally bad government. limited weak central government s are best. weak relative to the population that is able to put them in check. you re right so what you want to maintain not your ability to vote for 10 to 16 people in various parties who have already been chosen by an elite click. they rigged the election by the time you got to vote and it has always been this way representative democracy is a failure. all it seeks to do is limit real democracy and the will of the people. all the legitimate arguments against mob rule in democracy cannot stand in comparison to all the legitimate critiques of representative democracy which the founders had no historical evidence of to critique at the time the us consitution was written. defending the constitution and the founding fathers seems folly to me whereas defending the rights enshrined in them seems a better use of our time. the founding documents may be laden with wisdom but they are not gospel.
so freaking true
god is with us. asbury in kentucky. that was not their plan  but it was his. keep our faith strong. prepare for the worst  pray for the best. let s stay united in good. they will fall  somehow some way  and we will be prepared to pick up the pieces.
i question whether the usa  or any government  has ever been a force for good in the world.  yeah  we were a big part of beating hitler but then we stood aside for stalin and mao to do the same thing.
they ve been doing this for a long time now. it s both sides doing it.
one of her best waxings
don t  forget trading an arms dealer for mr. griner.
not sure i agree with you about the boomers.
my lord and savior jesus of nazareth  trained me as i am today.
good show.. thanks for telling people america was a constitutional republic not a democracy.  psalm 118 verse 8 it s better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man.
i watch many christian channels on youtube and they all agree with you.  breads and circuses  is definitely the word that goes around... it was the words that rings in my mind when i hear about the professional ball players. the emperor has no clothes but behind curtain posing as the great and powerful oz  gold money  he thinks we cannot see his shame and nakedness. we expose him by telling the truth and the world hates us because they hated and killed the master... how much more his servants  we are the servants of the most high god! thank you for being the hands and feet for christ here on earth  you are a great source of encouragement to me.
i didn t choose trump bc i thought he was great  but bc i believe all the others to be horrible! our lawmakers are all corrupt and un-touchable. desantis gabbard in  24! thank you!
we have a few months of food put back  but i know it will become very hostile as soon as the food and money disappears. i don t expect to live long when it happens  but i plan on taking out as many ass holes as i can.
now the wef wants governments to ration meat. i find it interesting considering 1st timothy  4 3 where it says they will seek to not allow people to eat meat. i also find it interesting when i am doing research and finding that for many people a carnivore diet is very helpful for their health.
we need to have someone strip all the amendments from the constitution and reset it.
one incident after the other is not a coincidence they are all meant to be a distraction
just sitting here waiting for us christians to be fed to the lions in a arena.
we are under attack...on our soil... sleeper cells are waking
your so beautiful when you show is how god made you! no make down...
i disagree with your premise that 90   of the ppl in government are sociopathic.   never attribute malice to that which can be adequately explained by incompetence .most of them probably had good intentions  but were stonewalled so many times that they justified moral hiccups to accomplish goals for the greater good.
ask why they are comfortable with sending our money that we work for to another country while we need it here.
i m glad i took western civilization i and ii at college with emphasis on the dual legacy of ideals. otherwise i wouldn t have fully appreciated this rant.
us good people need to flock together and displace the bad ones.    to for an uprising....
dig deeper and you ll find they re all the same. if they aren t compromised now they will become compromised later. the issue is the entire system.
@craquedeggs  no disagreement here. but i ve gotta at least try choosing those who might possibly do the least damage...idk.
have you read what god hath wrought  if not  this book will have everything make sense.
the most liberating aspect of preparing for uncertain future was realizing that beef is superior to beans. i implore y all to look into the carnivore diet.
did you hear    they are shipping the  toxic waste  all over the nation !  illegally  !!!
trust god  study and obey his word  spread the gospel of christ  pray without ceasing and watch for jesus  return for his church.
use wisdom to prep  but trust god  because we can not prepare for every scenario of tragedy. preparing for your eternity is foremost your first priority  believe in the saving redemption and reconciliation that god provided through his son jesus christ. he has redeemed us back into his kingdom  he justified us and paid the debt of our sins. this bring great peace because he seals us with his spirit and said he d never leave us nor forsake us  his peace that passes all understanding.
i think they are only allowed to do this because tribulation for judgment has begun

couldn t agree with you more biden trump whoever they re all in the same team
we are now a constitional republic. russia is a friend during this time period.
do an internet search on what embalmers are finding in their cadavers that they are processing. look at the rate that they are finding what they are finding. some scary stuff.
jesus said that in the latter days there will be great deceptions  so much so  less those days be shortened  even god s very elect can be deceived. pray for spiritual discernment in all that you do.
correction  russia won the ww2 ur thoughts  keep it up
recommended language change   biden administration  to  biden mal-administration .accuracy is important!
i would agree nana.   we are a constitutional republic not a democracy.
pn i m a boomer and we didn t have more children because we couldn t afford them. we had latch key kids both parents had to work to barely make it. war  high mortgages  used car repairs  clothes  wall street crash  more kids were not the sensible answer. those mouths had to eat. health care wasn t available  insurance at work nill  second hand furniture. second hand life!
who told the east palestine fire dept and the negley volunteer fire dept to burn the dangerous chemicals  my cousin works for negley vfd. my whole family is there. you never burn dangerous chemicals. that should have been a hazardous waste cleanup. someone messed up.
damn straight.
if we are already dismayed by what has happened so far. we better gird our loins  buckle up tight and put on the full armor of god because there is a lot more to come. we are only in the beginning stages. i hope none of us lose faith or hope. hold on tight it is coming. thank you  so much patriot nurse.
they held the oil company s accountable for loosing oil in the oceans. i don t see any difference with the train companies for loosing toxic chemicals in the environment.
when we the people get enough of this bullcrap we will stand up and surprise them all....
all i know is that i am sick   tired of u.s. citizens   non-u.s. citizens voting my rights as an american away!  i apologize to everyone for my voting behavior in the past and promise to never vote another person s god given right over to another human.
thoroughly agree
yes  our founders were prophets in their own right.
problem in us a  politics is that there are no good  players  on the game field. nothing good with democrats  nothing good with republicans  and especially nothing good when you elect somebody  outside   like d. trump  then you have total disaster. and  real answer s   well  i can t see them on the horizon  although american academia   genius s have answers  but  there are problems about that  because answers would be unpleasant for them  for  outer  players  leading politics   politicians  and  especially   for public opinion     or for adult citizens of us a .
we are living thru the final act of the fourth turning
once the boomers are gone  if there is a major societal failure   i. e. a grid down situation for any length of time   a  war or economic collapse  etc   it s over   and life as we ve known it  is not coming back.  the boomers made the transition from a  analog   economy to a digitized economy . the boomers could repeat the process and bring back a workable system in such a failure. the gen xs  millennials and gen zs have never lived in anything  but a digital world and will not be able to recover a workable system when there is  systemic failure.. we are truly at a civilizational turning point and it s not looking good..
sighhhhh  patriot nurse  we can only focus about today as tomorrow might not come.
i am shocked by what you re saying. i ve been working since i was 11 years old i put into the system. i ve actually never taken anything back from the system and i ve got all my credits and social security and you re absolutely wrong about this one.  my money that i was forced to put into social security is not an entitlement. it is my money that s been given to people that  never earned it.  having more kids not the answer  having real and meaningful jobs and actually contributing to society.  with all the unfounded wars in illegal immigrants that we re supporting right now  nobody in this country  would have anything to worry about.
i think too many americans view the fed govt in a hierarchical manor in which the fed govt is at the top  probably with the president actually at the top. this is something that maybe humans naturally gravitate to because washington even addressed this just before he became president. apparently early americans  to include govt officials  were calling for washington to be the first king of america at the time. our fed govt is not supposed to be that way. the people are at the top of the hierarchy and the fed govt is kind of off to the side protecting our rights  not granting them  and making sure there is a level playing field to the extent possible but not creating the playing field  if that makes sense. government serves the people.  america  both the fed govt and the people  have moved so far away from that construct.ultimately the people are at fault for not maintaining that system  not staying educated  becoming soft  and most importantly losing the focus on god through christ.
i m 62 at the end of the baby boomers.  i wanted more children but it didn t happen. i don t plan on retiring  filing for medicare or social security.
our nation is under judgement  which is why all promotion comes from above  and god appoints all positions of authority  and since the vast majority  has turned their backs on god and his only begotten son  he is promoting nothing but reprobates to lead the world into the great tribulation. accept jesus christ as your lord and savior  and accept his free gift of salvation for everlasting life.
it seems like a burden to see the truth ... but it is a blessing in our souls. why some of us could see things coming and slowly change. till  all at  once it seems like an invasion of the body snatchers over night !  why some can see  others feel helpless and still others refuse to see and argue that us that can see are wrong !   i truly want to punch in their face by now !!  i see now how friends and family turned on people during the holocaust.  they truly think they are helping the government and will be a hero in the government s eyes !  till the government  is feasting on their bones. they may see !
pn  agree with one exception  correct me if i m wrong  but social security is not an entitlement. welfare is an entitlement. social security is bought and paid for  money owed. the government  had they invested the funds correctly instead of using those funds as their personal account  would at worst  last much longer than they claim it will. god bless and keep you and yours.
usa has evolved prophetically to the later part of the beast out of the earth. it started as a lamb with two horns.  rev 13  it later speaks like a dragon. it restores the beast out of the seas. which is the little horn that speaks blasphemy.  dan 7 . see stephen bohr   the little horn that speaks blasphemy. lots of history.
didn t this railroad have a derailment a few years back that had a chemical spill that killed people
anyone see the way trump was welcomed and but judge was welcomed   also but judge acted and looked like he didn t want to be there just like the entourage he had with him . yeah 81 million votes ..... totally totally legit .
amen sister
the person most responsible for the empowerment of a large centralized federal government was abraham lincoln.
i don t actually know anyone who is being honest with the situation s  we are facing. i often feel quite alone.
you probably don t know the half of it.  get a bible and read and pray    they have a worldwide program in the works.
@sl4983  what exactly do you mean  i ve been studying this stuff longer than you ve probably been alive...since you want to  flex  hope you are actually reading that bible like you claim to be. support others and don t be a prick. that s the biggest issue we face. infighting by ppl like yourself.
this is my constant inner dialog  all day long....  pretty bad.
the father will take care of us as he did the children of israel when they crossed over the red sea
god bless you pretty lady !
the only good thing we exported from america is capitalism. this is because the tares came in soon after the good men were established here  those tares then planted their own government  which is the america we have today. but not for too much longer...
united states of america is going the way of rome.constant wars and overspending had significantly shrank rome s coffers  and oppressive taxation and inflation had   widened   the   gap   between    rich     and      poor! to avoid the taxman  many members of the wealthy classes had even fled the country and set up independent fiefdoms. at the same time  the empire was rocked by a labor shortage. rome s economy depended on slaves  minimum wage workers   to till its fields and work as craftsmen  and its military might had traditionally provided a fresh influx of conquered peoples to put to work. but when expansion ground to a halt  today   syria  ukraine   rome s supply of slaves and other war treasures  iraq and libya s gold  began to dry up.
exactly right.
thank you for being brave enough to say the us is not a force for good in the world anymore. and this has being going on for a long time.
god bless you thank you dear!
russia is the largest christian nation in the world  and her cause is righteous and just and justified.
thank you trump for your deregulations...hence the people suffer
agree with you.  i wondered why evil people gravitate toward government.  then scripture gave me the answer.  jesus said  you are of your father the devil  and his lusts will ye do.  satan fell because he lusted to be god.  i m sure part of that was god is all powerful and no one is above him.  when people crave power  they reveal who there father is.  main reason good  decent people avoid government is because they spent their whole lives earning a good name  and campaining for office and serving in office will ruin their name.  there are some good people serving in office  but not enough to turn the tide.  trump knew how to get things done  and he was strong enough to stand against everyone.  that s why they had to get him out. that s why they won t let him back in.  he may get reelected   but they ll try to assasinate him.  if god doesn t protect him  then the secret service won t be able to stop it from happening.
one can either apply the seal of god  deut.6 8-9  or they will be forced to apply the mark of the beast. in whom shall you serve  will we serve god  which includes the father and son  our scriptures or mankind.we can take the ten commandments and obey the father and the sermon on the mount and  keep  both the voices of our lord and god. with god we are given a choice  with the beast you will be forced. and now we need to see that the anti-christ copies god  so just as god has us  put on  his seal  so shall the anti-christ. make the choice while you can.the number of a man is when governments  businesses  all industries etc. come together and becomes a beast. so who will become the lord and god  or ruler of the world  the beast is rising don t wait too long to make your decision.
do you have to use paypal to sign up for your class
christian history has never been 100  pacifist. jesus taught the middle ground and had to teach a select few to do and be the same. the rest of us do not and will not have the option for pacifism 99  of the time. evil will never be removed by legal  moral  or ethical methods.
hi patriot nurse  i love some of your videos. however  i do not agree with your statement that ukrainian  russian or other post-soviet people are not enlightened. if you watch soviet or post-soviet films and listened songs you ll understand that you are wrong in your opinion. the co-founder of teosophical society in america was russian madame helena blavatsky. she was born what is now ukraine. also the nicholas roerich museum in new york city is dedicated to the works of nicholas roerich  a russian-born artist whose work focused on nature scenes from the himalayas. and there are a lot of other enlightened post-soviet people.
sad.  brilliantly said.
how quickly the democrats forgot the afghans. we are supposed to care about the ukrainians and forget the afghans.
thank you.
excellent.
if my memory serves me correctly...you are speaking of the dreams of daniel.
btw  in a figurative way....preach!!!!
my wife is is one of those people i have and hard time trying to prep for all is coming
nothing like an apocalypse to make sales
you are so right.
question. i don t get the thing  .. so if i had to go in to a hospital for some reason should i be worried about what blood they give me if i need it  ie blood with the thing  .  thanks
all you touched on has been in several domestic pastries. all with five fingers as thieves.  1 federal  2 state  3 counties  4 city town 5 private  industrial managed   each is not transparent to their fellow beings. welfare and all reasons services have corruption. yeast bread indeed!
you  are a very smart girl. with a ton of common sense.   pretty rare nowadays    keep bringing us the true  things you know. we l see them too. you must have learned things before wokness   stupidity. i m just guessing.   old school  i love the way u think. cause most of us do 2
i would also like to add a piece of stare decisis known as town of castlerock v gonzales  it was a 2005 scotus decision that ruled 7-2 that the town and it s police department could not be sued for failure to enforce a restraining order that lead to the untimely demise of a woman s 3 children by her estranged husband.let this sink in  the police have no obligation to serve and protect anyone and this isn t the only example of stare decisis evidence that proves this  we also have warren v dc and deshaney v county winnebago  therefore  per herriot v city of seattle and luria v us  citizens  are a legal fiction. those interested in learning more ought to do so as there us far too much to type here.shabbat shalom
war is the most evil energy
it is written.  i ve seen it coming for years.
will you please watch the dimming documentary with dane wigington
everywhere this country has fixed this   enlightenment   has failed! every where. we are paying for it.
bless your heart
spot on pn....
say what you will  the simple fact is this  the generation that would be working and paying into ss  as i am  have been decimated by choices. sad but true.
stop asking why  power and money   learn to stand up and say no  we the people are not going to take it any more! stand where the lord tells you to stand! god bless all!
you are spot on
thanks for sharing
i think we re seeing another g tterd mmerung   dusk of the gods . the kind like occurred in the south at the conclusion of the u.s. civil war. only  this time  it s the whole u.s. ball of wax.
they also get into govt. to get rich .
rest assured  if this happened in a blue state this would have been addressed immediately.
truth!!!
i like your blue top  patriot nurse!!
thank you so much

hi beautiful family. have a great day
where is your website patriot nurse

all will worsen before it gets better  for sure.
bravo patriot no truer words spoken. how do we unite to fire all the bad ones trying to kill is  i m fighting and no one believes me.  boom

i love your channel
medical   i m already afraid to go to a hospital.  how they treated my dad in 2009-18 was not good  but tolerable   mom in mid 2021 was bad.  from bedpans and i.v needle tech knowledge  into and out of a body  and willingness to try to save her life  hospice care morphine bottle delayed   hospice care nurse arrivals delayed several times.  it was bad.  it can only have gotten worse now that vaccine mandates have surely driven out all or at least the vast majority of health care workers with at least half a working brain.  it s all about massive profits now.
and  thank you for saying we have a constitutional republic! this can t be nailed home enough!
i think that you see the picture much deeper than what you expose here.
amen !
time for a revolution

the news this am. 6 train derailed this year in ohio alone. ohio is the crossroads of rail travel in america. it s like someone wants them destroyed
if they dont cre about us . they dont care about the uk people either . what they care about is their money ! we know this uk people dont know this .
the founders warned us about foreign entanglements!!!
sorry to say  but they know there is nothing you can do about it
lady  can you tell me where i can stock up on ivermectin and antibiotics
thanks!
the poor armish were targeted !
amen!!
i love your brain!
you nailed it  but war is required for the usa economy  war with anyone  anywhere
so sad that you are 100  right.
in ohio  and every other aspect regarding freedom and speech ... jan6   and truth....and lack of it.
how about if the states form a coalition and help each other out
people whom want power should never ever be allowed to have anymore then to lift their own toothbrush.

thank you
bread and circuses  ahhh  the blind demise of the flesh and its lusts.
not every person that was just to serve and government positions was narcissistic
you re correct
war is a brilliant distraction.
god bless
thanks to those who voted for these clowns in office
so smart and pretty... patriot nurse is awesome
did you all read about the 3 oil refinery fires in mexico
they are invoiced
the only mistake is the democracy. or should i say the government.
what about medication coming from china most of the part.medication that people have to take every day.i think that will end one way or another.either china stops it  or the supply lines get so disrupted that stuff never will reach it s destination.another possibility is that government will stop it  to create more chaos.any ideas
no one can be prepared for what s coming.  get ready to die and be with god.
people are also sick in ontario canada  but because its canada the media is the usual  nothing happens here only in america  live living right across the border in southern ontario. you just can t teach intelligence people either got it or they don t

hey there - not sure if you know or not but none of your medical supply preparedness links work on your website...
it s the wef .
we don t really produce  and corporates and government are and have been coalescing as one for special interests rather than sovereign national interests now for decades  our foreign policy is one of posturing not of actual liberty nor does it involve the best interest of the united states. it is a dangerous time in america  it just that woke and progressive one in the same essentially  need to wake up into reality! you are right! i look at all those career politicians on the left  not as much as on the right  but enough that when you combine the two it is overwhelmingly formidable to a point that we are beyond return to what we were as a sovereign power  and a hope to the people of this world. we pray for gods mercy! we can t pretend to be something we have been far removed from for the sake of wanting to be something else of what god imbued us to be. i feel this is a curtain call. this generation i feel is too far gone.
100 x
4 24   a few good people in government  makes me think of the days of abraham when he reasoned w the the angel of god to save sodom   gomorrah if there were found as few as 10 righteous men.... there were not 10 and it was destroyed... i d take the bet the same is true of our current government.
purdy and smart
crimes against humanity

i thought the constitution read   keep commerce regular  not regulate commerce. thats the reason the government has grown in power  that it don t have. we need to look into that.
patriot nurse  do you have any thoughts to share about the upcoming ban of the sale of antibiotics to farmers this june 11th  2023   no longer will be available without a veterinarian prescription.  this is going to hurt so many small farms and not mention all kinds of animal rescue groups who help homeless dogs and cats and all kinds of hurt critters that just need help. sounds like big pharma is about to boost their profits by requiring a prescription.  now  they will charge many times more for the exact same medication.  why are they taking away access to this medicine from anyone who can walk into a tractor supply store and buy animal antibiotics   is there a new r o n a on the horizon or some other bio attack they don t want people to have alternative access to these meds for
the perview of the federal government is to safeguard the rights of    men       granted  by god     not just    the american citizens     as was stated @ 5 25 ...there was no such thing as an   american citizen   when the constitution was written.....no immigration tests   no group by birthplace assigned more value than others....the very concept of   citizenship   was repugnant to our founders  it lended itself to   privilege   or private laws applying only to a certain group of select individuals .... the idea that only dc approved   citizens   were to enjoy the rights and protections afforded in the constitution is both historically and morally wrong.... there were no voting laws at this time   the states   with wildly different values   had to ratify the document.... if you make the argument about minorities women jews non land owners being excluded from the political process at that time  wouldn t that be a little bit awkward to defend from your perspective      after the revolution  the laws of coverture  established during the colonial period  remained in place. these laws ruled that when women married they lost their legal identity. women could not own property  control their own money  or sign legal documents.... so not only could you not own a gun  you couldn t even buy one according to the founding fathers  much less vote....women were in essence  property....am i wrong here

goof report
americans need to label their enemies as enemies. there is too much emphasis on political correctness and diversity   inclusion
as much as i love the united states of america i am constantly amazed by your instance in changing history.you did not win ww1 or ww2 in actual fact you were late to both you did help all the other nations beat the axis powers .they were called world wars for one simple reason.the majority of nations were fighting and they all played a part don t be so bloody arrogant and ignorant.from the start america has always had foreign help in every one of it s conflicts the french in the war of independence and so on.war is a horrendous affair had you been behind a bayonet you would know that there is no glory in war it serves no other reason than to further the power of politics.i have been involved in war and the books say that those conflicts were won by politician s or officers people who played no part in the real war.so i will never apologize for correcting those whom experience war through books or films.
