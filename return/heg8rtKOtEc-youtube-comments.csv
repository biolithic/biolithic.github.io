melonie  you are a breath of fresh air.  thank you for the Bible verses.  as someone who has been struggling with his fellow Christians over the past few months  its nice to see just some good  old-fashioned  straightforward affirmations.

just found this channel  what a genuine breath of fresh air  the Bible does say that a sign of the last days are critical times hard to deal with  and people being more lovers of pleasure than lovers of God and man one look at social media and we can see prophecy coming true. I dont see how not sexualizing children is somehow wrong or homophobic... then again people s attention spans are not disciplined enough these days to fully read the bill in full to begin with -- so with thatsaid  stay sane  and have a great day.

melonie  Ive been here since the beginning and commented on all of them! my birthday is on april 5 and maybe a guy going through a brain cancer treatment can get a happy birthday and or prayer  we need more positivity in this world and every day  I wake up ready to live each day the best I can!
