stay strong melonie   this country is crying out for godly women.  we need a generation of womenon fire god and his ways.   men as well of course  but the war on women from a-z from the leftis killing our families and way of life stay the course  stay on the straight and narrow.   thank you all you do.
thank god  we can always watch the old movies that weren t woke
tumblr shippers love gay pedro characterseta  as a 38 yo bi woman  i still find  queer  to be offensive so you re not alone in cringing at it  melonie
there s a reason the biggest increases are in places like california  chicago  and ny. i know you get a lot of hate for expressing your faith  but i m praying for ya to be able to keep it up. have a wonderful day  melonie.
countdown to another horrible failure and blaming everyone else and not themselves.
faith in the face of adversity shows strength. keep up the strong morals and ethics.
just wanted to say your shirt game yesterday was s-tier  11 10 material.thank you for being your awesome  uncompromising self  melonie
i m gay and i find the term  queer  offensive because it was and is a derogatory term. i ll never use it  and it makes me sick that the radical alphabet community are trying to make it a thing.
you are so magical because she has a presence that is beyond extraordinary. amazing because she does everything in style. determination because her hard work nit only pays off but shows what greatness is about by having drive   passion. irresistible because she has a beauty that is for beyond sex appeal but filled with class  character  and elegance.
we all know this will fail miserably and of course they will blame everyone but themselves
melanie mac must be protected at all cost. the world would be a better place if there were more people like melonie. thank you for speaking the truth. god bless you sister.
thank you for being a strong presence and person who openly speaks the truth in love. your positive influence is commendable.
pedro is someone i m genuinely tired of seeing
take back the rainbow   god s promise. great video melonie. keep up the great work. this was too funny.  that s my jacket!    just a couple cowboys.
i admit that for far too long  i did not read my bible regularly. it was the end of 2019 i believe  that i finally started reading a chapter a day. i started with jumping around to various books  but the following year  i went back to the beginning and read from genesis onward. i m currently in mark  and my understanding of the bible  while nowhere near perfect  is exponentially better than it was.i am not a perfect christian  but reading the bible is most assuredly the best way to grow a relationship with god. you won t be sorry.
i d watch the entire movie if we can have melonie dub it!  that was epic
i love it when you discribe the scenes and the voices.  never stop being you. never stop calling out sin melonie. with you.
i could listen to melonie talk about all the craziness in the world for hours.her voice much love and respect from this lowly norse heathen  to this sweet christian lady.melonie a real woman
i love that you have more compassion than what people try to say  you just care and thats what counts
you re the best narrator ever i swear lol.  i hope you re having a wonderful day melonie  it s great to see that you seem to be doing well.
physical is the best media. they re changing things in digital form.
they ll be going up in value now
i pretty much filter any movies tv by date  anything created after 2010 is an instant pass.
it s beyond woke. i mean  it looks really campy cheesy. the first minute or so  it looks like it could be interesting  but then it gets weird. and  being woke doesn t help.
befor they make them illegal for being non inclusive. sadly
yep  why do you think every single entertainment industry just magically decided within the same span of 5 years to start phasing out physical media   you cant delete and censor what people already own.  video games  movies  and music  even books to a certain extent   must all be censored and rewritten for a  modern audience
yes like tropic thunder or old school great and fun movies.
any good western recommendations
wasn t john wayne in the closet
there s tons of old stuff that would be considered woke today. the only difference is that the term  woke  did not exist to describe them.
tumblr shippers love any gay content  as long as it s gay content. i remember how hollywood literally made one famous woman a lesbian for no reason and the shippers were like  oh what an interesting pairing! .
@andrewfantome not just them. white women teens absolutely love gay content. they advocate for it  and that s why there s so much of it.
@low distortion  what i said somehow excludes it
@andrewfantome  nah lol you re right too!
they stopped using smear the queer for that reason but that word has come back and is apparently okay now .what idiots make these decisions
tumblr shippers you got it. the same people who used to write some pretty disturbing stuff at fanficition and live journal lol ten years ago there was at least some semblance of creativity  but it s always been mostly about pairings and shipping. these people ship actual friends or even siblings in real life and warp the real world to fit their fantasies. and yes  it exploded in tumblr  moved to twitter - there s some of it there still  but it went back to tumblr  full force.
@sarn  you torture my heart. i still remember the days when all shipping was fun and people didn t pm you a bunch of insults just because you translated straight douj with characters they thought were gay.
@theinitiate110  i think that s a bit of an over exaggeration. there are some great films and even western films out still. bone tomahawk is amazing
brokeback mountain was not a success they baited people into seeing that movie thinking that it was just a regular western  luckily my friends told me before i wasted my money.
thank you so much
bingo! more gender clinics pop up around heavy blue areas
@quatrinavr  so true man  i moved to a small town in texas from minneapolis a couple years ago and the difference is night and day.
hey bro how do you send a specific amount of money  20 exactly instead of  19.99  i see only option that end in .99
its a short film  not supposed to make money in the first place
@marco sagrero  it looks like one of those joke movies at the beginning of tropic thunder.
@w1llki11edsnake07  pretty much  its gonna premiere at cannes  not even in the competition.
thank you so much  i appreciate you  _
@melonie mac go boom and just know  i appreciate how you stand on the front lines and preach the bible-- not  progressive  ideologies. so many churches are neglecting the meat of the word  and boy am i glad god has raised up someone as sharp and funny as you to do what s right. i m glad to stand by and support you  melonie
same.  i m not sure if it raises to  offensive  for me  but i wouldn t use it.  then again i don t really relate to the alphabet types.
@nick scarlato  i m not a sjw or a snowflake type of guy  but i do find the word  queer  to be offensive personally. it gives me flashbacks to when i was bullied in middle school. it s a derogatory term. soon they ll want us walking around calling ourselves the f word.
@g d  some already do.  i try to have a thick skin and ignore a lot of the lunacy going on myself.  i tend to have to avoid political topics with a lot of the most left leaning people i know.
@nick scarlato  i also have a thick skin and i do my best to ignore the craziness  however it s getting to the point where the radicals no longer want me to refer to myself as gay and instead call myself a derogatory term. nah  i m done ignoring it and i won t be degrading myself to be more  inclusive  or whatever other reason they have to use the word  queer .
i remember when it was bad to say in the 90 s! haha!
good for you  nice show  job well done.the war of words takes you out.  i used the word  pass  when refusing to answer a question.somehow  that word  in every context  forever onwards  is in the appropriated reality.so many polls from bags of water to prove ownership of air with a flavor....god  state  law  you are owned by the all of the they for a very long time.i know the value of a pass.someone deciding who should do anything or else...
@g d  yeah no thanks.  for me i m just a regular dude who happens to be gay and i don t care to spend tons of time talking about being gay or trying to be oppressed or  queer .  i live in a solidly conservative area and get along with everyone perfectly fine.  but i do have an american flag out now a pride one lol.
@g d  queer in the social justice ideology no longer means gay. it means gay and politically active. the cult requires you to adopt and advocate for the ideology and become part of the cult or you are the enemy.
well  have you thought  you know  not being gay  lgtbq
@brother grimaldus  lol.
in grade school in the late 90s everyone called eachother queers as an insult
i thought it was like black people reclaiming the n-word or whatever that was.  idk  i m not black or gay  i just know when people get mad about certain words and then i try to avoid using them.  the problem is that people keep changing what s okay to say  and then get upset when the rest of the world doesn t keep pace.my dad   he was a  uh  um colored  person...me   just say  black guy .  that s what we say now.i used to have to ask people what race they were as they were being booked into jail  and some dudes would correct me if i said  african american   because they weren t from africa  which actually makes perfect sense to me.  now i say  black   but previously  african american  was the  correct  way of saying  a black person   and  black  was the insensitive way of referring to someone with dark skin.  at a certain point you realize you can t win and just kind of stop caring.
isn t the term gay also a flippant misnomer as well  gay meaning joyful or happy  though it is a positive term it is inaccurate.
yea i m in my 40 s and when i was a kid i used to play a football tackle game called   smear the queer .. i knew it was bad but had know idea what it was about.. lol
it s kind of like latinx for latinos and womexn... i don t even...
@silas henderson  is that why they re all about embracing every slur out there  nothing says you re a white savior ally  like calling communities their selective slurs. totally not an istandphobe whatsoever. nope.
@w4iting4th3sun 91 f-g  qu r  gay  etc we re all insults back then.
@this is what happens  larry  woke sjweirdo   that s person of color! us   isn t that just colored person backwards  woke sjweirdo   reee!!! us  grabs pepper spray
same here  hate it!
i mean honestly who cares  they re just words i call people derogatory terms when i m on my game all the time and i don t care for their personal feelings about it  they re just words if someone gets offended by a word that s their problem
@malenia  blade of miquella  i care because i have self respect and refuse to walk around calling myself a derogatory term. if you re cool with that then fine  i guess. not me though  i have self respect.
@thatharvguy  that is typically the sound they make too haha  reeee
but what if no one cares what you find offensive...
@bob hope  what if  finish your point  if you even have one.
@g d  i agree.  and also aside from being gay i live a pretty conservative life inclusive of my community  meaning the neighborhoods in which i live where i m probably the only gay household .  i don t identify as  queer  at all.
i m bisexual and i feel the exact same
aw thank you so much!
i absolutely want to see more quick synopsis movie trailers from melonie. that was hilarious
@otterloopb  ikr! that would be my favorite thing  it s like the randy orton rko out of nowhere movie trailers  but using her version of the dialogue instead.
you should make more voiceovers for trailors! that was hilarious!
pedro  pascal is quickly becoming like nicolas cage  the dude is in nearly everything that is new nowadays lol.
love the voice over and summery. it was more interesting than the movie ever could or will be. good to see someone with common sense and morals.  stay righteous and keep doing the right things.   the shirt was great. started looking for it right away. the rainbow was a promise from god. not a logo for immortality.
melonie we need more trailer recaps by you! better than the actual trailer
you need to do more reactions to trailers with you summarizing them
this is adorable. i d watch whole movies with her narrating them
i think she should seriously have a channel just summarizing trailers in her own way lol
okay we need more melonie mac trailers. this should be a mainstay because that was amazing
you should definitely make more videos just dubbing trailers! always hilarious!!
i feel like you getting demonetized for showing trailers is a blessing in disguise because your summary of the strange way of life trailer was hilarious.
melonies dubbs are hilarious
just go watch unforgiven or high plains drifter for a true western about bringing justice to scumbags who did grave harm to the innocents. love ya mel  please keep up the good work  hope you re doing well   thanks for the gfuel btw! gets me through 3rd shift  also  you gonna be on twitch tonight
look at pedro pascal s western then look at gina carono s western movie. tells me all i need to know. my family quit mando after season 2. don t regret it.
melonie  your trailer narration is hilarious! do more of that!
honestly this is whole thing is disgusting the that people are making dudes being strange to each other as normal. is degenerate. your doing a good job at speaking up  keep it up. i like the message the shirt sends but i m afraid of wearing it where i am  because of how many people would take that the wrong way.
love your reactions   this would be a great format. lmao
i admire that you speak out on this issue.
it s not just that they are overflowing everything with gay stuff  but they hate to show any normal or straight relation making the movies and shows very boring. no flirting no joking no nothing.
i think you re genuinely awesome. keep up the great work!
i m suprised they didn t call it wokeback mountain
i hope he s the new sam worthington i.e he basically vanishes after the hype dies down.
except nic cage is great!
except mando lol
watch the hbo series deadwood from the early 2000s...like westerns  best investment.
unforgiven is a great movie.
@killaklownwerld  oh for sure  i have to get into that as razorfist sings it s high praises lol
she taking a break from twitch right now. she ll probably start back up in may some time. stay tuned to twitter and or instagram for updates.
@ambientspacenoise  if you like westerns it the best thing made post 2000... probably the best western series of all time. they made an add on film to tie everything up later but it s not as good as the series imo. the only film i can recommend post 2000 is ti west s in a valley of violence.
@ambientspacenoise  oh yeah the film bone tomahawk is also very worthy...my bad.
@killaklownwerld  oh fuck yeah  i heard about that one  thanks!
thank you so much
lol

totally calling it that from now on
ya beat me to it. well played good sir.
i very much enjoy and appreciate you and the content you make. taking up courage  confessing the faith  and being a light in a ever darkening world is a risky endeavor indeed. christ s blessings to you  and keep up the faith and the good work.
you dubbing that trailer was hilarious! i d watch videos just of you dubbing trailers
i agree with you. my goodness. love the hoodie. have your back on all the haters out there melonie. love ya. take care.
god bless you mel. you spreading the word of god makes him smile and you ll be rewarded for that in the kingdom of heaven. i hope to be as brave as you someday.
why do i feel like life is turning into  the crying game for those of you that remember that movie or that reference in ace ventura
can you do a series where you explain trailers to us. i loved it
keep speaking mel. speaking freely today is a super power and not many folks have the guts to excersize that freedom. bravo.
i love your take on the trailer and please.. please  could you do more trailer reviews this way
i think they way you did the trailer was better than watching it for real.  you will need to do this from now on with any trailer!
got to say melonie s commentary over that trailer is more interesting than the trailer itself
i m so glad my dad got me watching the black and white classics.
thanks for sharing the website melonie  i purchased my tshirt yesterday and i hope i am in a crowd of melomaniacs flooding his site and going out in it
seriously love your dubs.  i remember that one you did for the witcher blood origin episode sometime around the new year.  i really enjoy you doing these.
for extra laundry soap in case you wear your new shirt out a lot. buy the brand  cheer  cuz we are cheering for you or  all  because you are all that and a bag of carnivore crisps or tide because we are changing the tide against the current woke flood
i d only watch this if you dubbed the whole movie lol
great video. it s great to see that they can t keep ya gown and yer continuin  fightin . props to you.
keep speaking the melonie. always be in prayer for those that are lost. hopefully the people that stopped being your friends because of your faith will come to know christ. the lord is still in the saving business and he is too busy to put them on the right track.
dude i m just over it. keep it up sister killing it.
what did you just say   i think i prefer the dub voice over version  don t make me laugh at work so much
i m gay and i approve this message.
aw shucks  thank you
i watched magic mike for 2 hours thinking it was a boxing film.wont get me again though edit  mah jakkit
that was the greatest over dubbing of a video in the history of cinema.
in   agreement with you.
literally nobody asked for this.at this point all i want is a straight up action western with good practical effects and large battles.
pedro pascal of course  and the garbageloreon sucks.and yes  brokeback mountain was at a time when everything wasn t gay.
this is the way.  - pedro pascal channeling his inner oberyn martell
classic western shows can not be beaten.
thank you for standing up for what is right  and telling the truth.
there are two quotes i often think of   i don t want to live on this planet anymore  and  i say we take off  nuke the entire site from orbit. it s the only way to be sure.
no one ever suspects the murdering green jacket. i knew it would happen one day.
your trailer description was adorable
every time i see this  i remember one actor from a real cowboy region complaining that he had never seen such shit and the leftist media silenced him.
i just have two things to say 1. i didn t realize brokeback mountain was a question 2. where d you buy that sweet jacket
all the best with that rainbow shirt  really. i m probably going to try different tactics living out here in the sfbay   but i definitely love to see it
keep fighting the good fight  my sister in christ
those people need to learn that our faith is inherently counter cultural. that s just how it is in the christ following life. btw  i like the shirt. it reminds me of a shirt i wore in protest of pride month that had a cross on it and it was called   humbledtobesaved.
there have been some very beautiful films depicting gay characters most of them independentl darlings. blue is the warmest colour  boys don t cry  call me by your name all beautiful in their own way. we can t stop this but we can ignore it. i m always going to support independent films  music  video games  etc.
please do summaries all the time for trailers. that was 1000  better than the original!
when the summary is better than the trailer.
your commentary is priceless!
i don t know  if melonie mac did that commentary for the whole movie  it might actually be worth watching.
or if they live in san francisco. yes they are brave.  takingtherainbowback
i didn t think vincent freeman was expected to live long enough to get so old... yes  referencing the only other movie i ve seen ethan hawke in
i wonder what razorfist thinks of this. he just did a video of his top 10 westerns. kinda mad he didn t include tombstone.
i miss the twitch streams! i hope you re back to that soon. biggit army go!!
as melonie puts it  brokeback mountain was a hit for being too daring for its time  and this is why it was a success  nowadays queer stories are nothing out of the ordinary  it lost their mojo thanks to all the activities
i ended up buying one of those shirts. haven t listened to any of rabbi schneiders stuff on youtube yet. i imagine here in colorado i might get backlash for wearing the shirt  lol.
you had way too much fun dubbing that trailer lol
i m french  a very popular humorist in france in the 80 s who go by the name of coluche said  gays is the only species who don t reproduce but that it s spreading more than anybody else
the funniest review of a trailer ever. religion isn t my thing  but each to their own. respect.
love u . keep that hard work
that s my jacket!! i m on the floor x d
brokeback mountain did well because it was a good movie.  heath ledger and jake gyllenhaal were great in it. it wasn t a gay erotica or anything. it wasn t really a western either. catwoman from dark knight rises was really good in it  too.  randy quaid was funny as well.
youre hilarious  love it
also  what s next  pedro pascal decided to beat bingo out of wioke roles  will i be able to see him as a boylover or a cannibal in one of the next films
hey melonie i just want to say that this whole western queer issue or thing is out of control and out of hand and so i feel like sin has taking over it   sin is holding god down by demons and not letting god take control of this issue and destroying it for good. anyway i just want to make a comment on this topic of this video for today  ok melonie. anyway keep doing a great work and keep telling the whole world bout how god is love and how god loves each of use too  ok melonie. hope you had a great day and hope you continuing to have a great evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. p.s. i like and love your playstation hoodie melonie. anyway have a great evening melonie.
best trailer summary ever!!
a company needs to come out that edits out every gay part of a movie show.  call the company defagify.
you should just re-dub trailers - was proper funny
i prefer this sort of trailer review in the future way more than commentary
that s my jacket
lil melonies pronunciation of almodovar is perfect!
this shit is gonna bomb like the rest of those gay movies
they should just have you explain trailers from now on. it seems that hd is trying to bring back the western but of course they re going to deconstruct them  the way they did superheroes.
as soon as i hear it s an almod var film it made sense. carry on
they re trying to get ahead of the comeback of the westerns so they can say that s gay too. you want to watch a kick ass western with good values  the entire series of have gun will travel is on youtube for anyone to watch
i m just upset that it stars 2 amazing actors like ethan hawke and pedro pascal
it s the only thing they could come up with to make people stop pirating movies and tv and games and music
god bless you melonie
gonna be honest  i am letting this play on mute while cooking   then eating eggs  even washing the dishes after before i come back.i am adamently opposed to consumption of qu33r entertainment in any format. gotta keep my mind under my control wholly
completely agree with you.
every morning i read several chapters of the bible every morning and also teach others
okay but why though   - mr. perfect cell
that s so cool that you ve been listening to a messianic teacher.
i like the 2003 hulk colored jacket in particular.
the real question is this  why do they have to put sexuality into everything
all they need is some bondage gear and they ll be an old 80s punk rock band from south florida.
the only time i watch anything is when somebody is reviewing it
love it!
it s the end of the world as we know it.   - rem
to keep a good esg score at these companies obviously!
i ve never seen broke back mountain either and dont plan on watching it in fact my friends and i stay tease each other referencing the movie
preach girl i love you
tts throne emperor   this is surreal. am i on drugs
i sure want the old way back
please get more furniture. you can t just work out and stream. well i guess you can tbh.
like you  i have no intention of ever watching brokeback mountain. stand your ground and god will bless.
i ll just keep watching my yellowstone where cowboys are cowboys. thank you very much.
well ma am  at least your heart is in the right place.
ffs. this is why i don t watch much modern day stuff. so far beef  is the best thing i ve seen all year
another reason for wearing the shirt in july could be because it s the 7th month. important distinction between the false alphabet  rainbow  and the natural rainbow created by yhwh  the former has 6 colors  while god s rainbow has 7. in biblical numerology  the number 6 represents mankind  essentially  god created man on the 6th day  and recall the symbolic number of the beast . the number 7 represents holiness  like how the 7th day is sanctified by god  and wholeness  perfection. replacing the natural rainbow which is a reflection of the lord s holiness and perfection with one representing humanity s imperfection  and thus sinfulness  is a deliberate subversion of moral principles. it symbolically represents supplanting god s will with our own which we already know is disastrous. it s particularly insidious because it s not the sort of evil one notices right away  it s luciferianism hiding in plain sight.
hey sis great to c a new video from u have a great night  i c the haters r making ur sub count grow fast  i love to c it
nice dub
if the movie has melonie s dub then i m all in but other than that i don t want the movie  lol i have not seen one thing that interests me since i ve started my walk with christ. i just stick to my old shows and cartoons lol. your videos are the best melonie love them god bless!!
12 04 the bible is food and drink for the soul
it s the shrek effect. shrek subverted expectations and it was so successful hollywood threw away traditional storylines and ever since than they have to subvert the subverted expectations that now have to be subverted again and again and again until nothing makes any sense. it s like vhs tape generational loss  if you keep copying the same video to a different tape  it becomes more and more distorted until it s nothing.
i thought this was some ai chat gp created film  someone typed in pedro pascal  ethan hawke gay cowboy western and got this weird messy madness
if these people actually want to make a great western  they should actually watch original westerns and take notes on what makes them good. maybe them being less woke  anyways! great video! love that you re wearing that scandalous playstation hoodie!
now a days you have to be careful what you watch. one of the last westerns i watched on netflix had that guy who played doctor strange i had no idea it was a gay movie until i watched it lol. i don t want to see that shit like i m ok with people being gay but i don t want to watch it in a movie especially one where i m unaware before watching. i m just tired of all the propaganda being pushed in media i d rather not support anything that has a blatant political agenda. the movie was pretty boring to but had a high rating on netflix and i knew why after watching it lol.
waiting for may 1 to donate
thank you so much  andrew!
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie! god bless you today!
let the hate comments commence lol. keep doing your thing man.
how come you look the same in all your weight loss progress pics
i was just catching up on your videos!!!
i think the only country that has done the lgbtq entertainment right is thailand which has way more gay shows than america. they don t force  the narrative like america they just focus on making good shows with likable characters and actual stories  example  gap the series. i m not going to lie that show made this 25 year old guy cry happy tears at the end of the show and i m not really into the lgbtq stuff and the mv for the theme song was the most adorable mv i ve ever seen.
how much are y all willing to bet that this is going to bomb at the box office just like the rest of them
is it crap  or are you finally seeing the world as it truly is
i don t know how you got recommended to me  but i m here for it.
mando season 3 was not that bad. it was good  could have been better. he helped take the planet back for his people  he did not want the power  he felt that he maybe did not deserve it as much as she did and he made the choice to till help and go back to his position and take care of his son. can t get more manly than that. bo is trained  capable and went through loss she is not a mary sue. i hope mario wakes all these companies and ip s up though and stop the wokenesd.
well american entertainment is just catching up with the rest of the world. with the exception of the middle east and caribbean lgbtq portrayal is quite common in many countries  especially in asia where it s acceptable. you d surprise the vast amount of gay characters in anime and manga and i m not talking about yaoi either.
i love pedro  but enough is enough...
pedro pascal is quickly becoming hollywood flavor of the month. dude could be okay actor  but he s showing up on everything that s trendy. gonna get old real fast.also  lol  damn. the trailer doesn t say anything about what this is about  which means this is a pretty empty  it is what s trendy  subvertion of the genre. i ll re-watch man with no name trilogy  3 10 to yuma  run man run and a few others more over here.this literally has no plot and the scenes looks less than stellar.
real time movies a thing.. should it now be a thing..
this is why i m going to watch anime instead and you are beautiful
i think i m with you on this -- i love westerns  and i won t watch this one either.
imagine just writing a good story and not putting woke crap into it.
wonder what pascal had to do for this recent string  success
normies discovering pedro almodovar films is both a curse and a blessing. the man is a genius and a visionary  and he made films with gay characters in them for about 40 years  long before any kind of woke hollywood agenda taking place. he s not even a hollywood director. almodovar made a huge contribution to cinema as an artfom and frankly  i think he s beyond proving his credentials to people who won t even watch some short festival film he made.
i m honestly surprised  that they didn t lean into that two-spirit thing yet. two indian braves and gay lovers butchering evil white men sounds like something  that would make hollyweird bigwigs euphoric.nice new shirt btw  i saw  that it rustled a boatload of jimmies.  p
i ve never seen brokeback butthole and i will never watch it or any other gay cowboy movie. i have to admit  though the way you described the movie trailer that was actually entertaining.
these stories could be cool if they were actually conceived as stories that people actually wanted to tell. instead its all corporate. it dont feel personal. a gay western black comedy with a real message about love and the human condition could be amazing. but sadly we get fed corporate man hating garbage.
i guess they wanna put the  poke  back in  cowpoke.
i ll hard pass  my grandpops was the man who showed me the western classic show gunsmoke  and several others. i d rather just watch actually good westerns  with manly men being manly badasses. if not  i ll go play red dead redemption  not whatever this is supposed to be. at this point  we shouldn t be surprised though  everything in this broken timeline needs to be gay. what does  queer  add to the story  or the characters  nothing. why does it need to be promoted and headlined  who knows. our forefathers look at us with shame
jesus loves all of us
so  he s part of the problem.... good to know.
my advice regarding reading your bible is don t take anything you read at face value and i mean anything. context context context is key and don t feel like you need some degree in theology to make sense of things. we d all be screwed if comprehending 100  of the bible was a requirement lol. not only context but many people don t even realize you can t trust many english words in the bible because remember it was translated from hebrew and greek and how we use certain english words today are way different than those languages and it s very easy to get the wrong idea because our english words might cause us to have a black and white view of scripture.
western bros . meet the same fate as well.
the lgbt community in the us accounts for less than 6  of the population.let that number sink in and then realize just how massively over-represented in media they are.i got no beef with gay characters  but they don t need to be prominently featured in absolutely everything that comes out.
it s a comedy. look at the camera they used to film it. it s a comedy. serious films aren t filmed this way in america.
anyone who rejects god and especially his son  will sacrifice their futures in an unimaginable place of love and pure joy for all eternity. what is a person s life span compared to  eternal life   believe in jesus and his finished work...that s all it takes.
i hate to tell atheists that they have the most faith out of every one. they just lack a role model.
who wants another brokeback mountain  nobody
i mean  i don t blame pedro pascal for taking every role that he gets offered.  he s a low rent nathan fillion knock-off who doesn t have much acting skill  he was best in mando with the helmet on  but most of that was him doing voice overs while the stunt actors did the good work  so he better get all the paychecks that he can.  i can t fault him for that.  and this has nothing to do with his beliefs  his culture  his opinions  or anything like that.  he s just not a very good actor so he d better grab income while he can.
the gays know they are doing wrong and they want us to tell them it s ok. when we refuse they call us names. call me what you want  that stuff doesn t work anymore. i don t hate anybody. i want them to come away from sin and repent. that s called love.
this is why i had to stop watching power  literally every spin off of the show has that token gay guy  it couldn t be more forced. book 2 is especially bad because it s focused on a college campus and my god  the cringe lines about capitalism and  oppression . you can tell the writers are fresh out of a woke college
funny. i was watching this netflix show  based on a manga  called  alice in borderland  and this character that was interesting and mysterious turns out to be trans. shockingly  that s how it is in the manga.not surprisingly of course is the manga version is totally drawn like a woman  not a trans. the actress in the show  clearly not a trans.anyway  turned it off and thumbs down.so  decide to start watching the movie based on that uhtred of babbenburg show  seve kings must die. 15 minutes in  two main characters  both men and allegedly christians  which they clearly aren t practicing christianity at all  gay stuff aside   start making out.off. thumbs down.yeah  if it ain t gay  it s trans.
pedro playing a gay cow boy  he was made for this!
it isn t enough to condemn homosexuality.it is necessary to encourage and support heterosexuality.religion condemns heterosexuality  and opens the door to homosexuality.whether it admits it or not.there is a reason the church has been  a hotbed of homosexuality.
trying to make westerns gay again! hand gesture lollove that ps hoodie!
i m honestly exhausted as a subscriber to your channel  and it s mostly because every single video devolves into a religious rant. i respect and get your religious views  and i have my own too. but not everything has to be interpreted in this manner. you ve effectively replaced woke agenda with your own agenda. please don t stop your religious beliefs or anything like that  but please try to tone it down. mostly the issue for me is it becomes preachy -- this is as bad as woke content telling me what to think or do. i m fine with unsubscribing if this is the niche you want to pigeon your channel in but becoming less and less for me  it s sad to say since i liked your original content and i hate woke stuff as anyone else on this comment section.
melonie go boom on the humor lololol
according to hollywoke  the entire world is black  or gay  or black and gay.
who knew we d see pedro pascal   hunter biden in a gay cowboy movie. wild times.
just a friendly reminder to drink water. everyone have a wonderful day.
strange way of life indeed
hello regarding nathan fillion i know that he will either get saved or is already.i had an unexpected dream about him in the night from march 20 to 21  2022 regarding this topic about him being saved!question  are you saved do you know that if you believe that jesus christ died on the cross for your sins  was buried and rose again the third day  you will be saved and have eternal life  this is the gospel  the good news  1 corinthians 15 1-4 1 moreover  brethren  i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you  which also ye have received  and wherein ye stand 2 by which also ye are saved  if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you  unless ye have believed in vain.3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received  how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 4 and that he was buried  and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures   only jesus christ can save you and give you eternal life! john 14 6  jesus saith unto him  i am the way  the truth  and the life  no man cometh unto the father  but by me.  maranatha
i m sorry  but what churches have you been going to that endorse homosexuality
my faith is the most important part of my life  so if you don t like it then you don t like me. you re either going to have to be ok with it or move on  because i will not fold on this.
apparently the mountains back wasn t broke enough. wonder how it got broke in the 1st place. well you know how the saying goes if it s broke  brake it again! right  maybe some day they ll see what s broke needs fixed. only god can make the crooked way straight.
i wonder if this will do as well as  bros
what are we calling it now  plowboys and indigenous
first brokeback mountain  now this.
you have a very fetching laugh!
hollywood is absolutely insane  but sony  games  are going on the same path...
this movie legit looks like satan s alley from tropic thunder
remember that team america song  just switch up the words and you have hollywood
again  all i can say is  ok...but why tho
and some people still wonder why i don t go to the cinemas anymore
i thought the trainwreck called  bros  would have showed any hollywood executive that making characters gay just because is sure box office doom.
pedro pascal actually agreed to participate in this. did he not make enough money from the last of us
4 13   what we did last night.....not tell know you hear
they wanna take our mythical hero from us. japan has the samurai and ninja  greeks have the spartans  the british have knights  the cowboy is our mythological hero and they want to ruin it.
they don t seem to understand they are catering to a small minority of the population and customer base gonna have a lot of leftovers and waste probably bankrupt the company
hahaha melanie narrating
but wait i thought you can only play those characters unless you are part of the community. where is the outrage.
god bless you lets take bake the rainbow
every time an actor does a gay movie  their careers take off afterwards.
i m glad someone is unrelenting on this woke movement. just when you believe it s safe to be watching westerns
haven t there been bad cowboy movies before  if this does bad it won t be anything new
lol
they don t care because our side never boycotts  at least we don t keep it up over the long term.
thanks for watching it so i don t have to.
welcome to the next episode of the last of butt segz. brought to you by budsegzer and budsegzer light.
wokeback mountain continues
pedro almodovar has been doing movies for decades  not very known in the us  but his stuff is pretty good. i don t think that movie will be another woke try hard from holywood. and yeah his movies are gay af. but he is actually a very good filmmaker storytelleralso  damn people. some are just gay  it ain t the end of the world
oh wow! it s that gal from the attack of the doc movie!
i m going to save so much money boycotting all these woke companies!another company added to the boycott list
good video
this will be better than bros.
taste the rainbow!
i ll just stick to movies like the good  the bad and the ugly
3 57
now they re going after westerns oh hell naw
cool shirt  awesome cause
oh great broke back mountain 2
tolerance is cowardice masquerading as virtue.
what can possibly go wrong...
lovr you melonie!
things be gay now because you took all the strays
you could do video reactions but turn the camera on you and not show the video your reacting too can maybe link to it as a option for those that want to see it
exactly  nothing woke about this movie  is a gay themed movie by the same guy that did y tu mama tambien. an almodovar movie isnt an almodovar movie without the gay sex
go boom
well at least pedro is on the bottom
hollywood is overrun with  alternative  lifestyle individuals. some good some not. i just assume cut the whole industry out of my life.
when its forced its cringe. same with any show relationship.
immasculating the male power fantasy  classic hollywood
guns  cowboy stuff  wrestling...  if that doesn t sum up this nonsense up then nothing will
there are still some gay people who find it offensive to be called queer.
again   was it ever a thing besides bb mountain   i m talking about the gunsmoke era of tv
what era is this supposed to even take place in cuz some of those textiles wouldn t have even been around in the old west.
brokeback mountain 2   the penetrationing
melonie good background
0 36 starlord and dr.strange
brokeback mtn was about sheep herders  not cowboys.  which makes sense  really.
never thought i d be part of a marginalized majority.
didn t work for a broke back mountain
mwga  put that on a hat
brokeback mountain was good enough  we don t need anymore  leave well enough alone damnit!
god s promise  not sodomytake back the rainbow
reminder  thank a straight man or woman for keeping civilization alive.
pedro is overrated
did the movie flop
@yu lee  yeah  guess what  everything wasn t gay then.
that wasn t really a western.
@yu lee  you know something i will admit when i m wrong. so i went back and looked at the grossing it was  178 million and i was like wow that s not s   . but then again i thought about the times that it actually happened in at the time they spent  14 million and during that time it would have pretty much equaled out to as much as an avengers movie
@chris valen  seems like they got there investment back
i heard about this. isn t broke back mountain the first gay western
it s social engineering.
netflix is dropping 2.4 billion on korean content. just think that is relevant
sorry but if pedro pascal is in this i will be going to see it
where did you get that playstation hoodie
lgbtq percentage in the us is 7.1 .  lgbtq content in movies and tv is 11.9 .  that s close to twice as much content...
nice pistol......i like your handgun too.......
it is almod var. what did you expect
still never seen wokeback mountain. won t see this  either.
w god s movement.
first  gay washing  then black washing  now queer washing
i miss texas.
watch out clint eastwood!  you re being replaced...
yea i like the john wayne movies.
hey melonie sure is not inspired in broke back mountain haha
break my ass up on the mountain
ooh ooh gay cowboys and aliens next puhleeeeze!
i m sick of pedro pascal. he s not that strong of an actor  almodovar has been making movies about people on the fringe s for decades. hitting people over the head with it   is a new thing though.  representation here and there is fine but it s everywhere now and people are obnoxious about it where they focus firmly on identity.
i ll just stick to john wayne and eastwood flicks.
i hate to break it to you  but things are gonna get way worse.   before it get better.. think of rev
insert coin tees
i see nothing wrong with this  i won t be watching it  but then  it s not made for me.
nobody but those people will watch it.  are there enough of them to make a movie profitable   because no one else is gonna watch it. nobody.  except swishy movie critics.
okay  let s get this over with
i have no interest to watch broke back mountain either.what i m saying i m with you melanieguess another movie fail..
soon being straight will be the weird thing in normal life  lolol
i m gonna pass
oh look  melonie has been triggered again.
they wonder why we laugh at them. pathetic
just another reason why i no longer watch anything made in this country and only watch korean stuff.
the best gay movie is happy together from hong kong because it s not about being gay  or oppression and is the farthest thing from being political
is the trailer sponsored by bud light
love you
if you can look at a swastika   not think of nazis  then i can look at a rainbow   not think of throwing up!nazis took a sign of peace   you know the rest  but you can t shake a stick at how often those two groups intersect!
mutilating the arts is part of the demoralization process
broke back mt no2 lol
sorry not sorry but pedro pascal gets his back blown out by executives   no way he s in everything without giving it up loll
im a 32 year old gay man and for some reason i just dont like watching any gay orientated focused movies  tbh even any sex scenes from straight to gay am like why do i need to see it in a movie  am i being entertained or supposed to be aroused watching this lol
broke back mountain was a gay movie about lovers. it was a love story. i don t think it s gonna work in cowboy movie. what happened to cowboys and getting the hot damsel in destress
i hate when the most masculine types of characters they make gay. i was so pissed then i found out about soldier76.
ezekiel 3.18
ain t that the truth  these celebs gotta do some crazy things to keep their fame. it comes with a price.
man forreal  i am so over sex scenes in general. i don t care who is doing them  i don t want to see that lol!
hey  its the playstation hoodie. gonna be watching the comments..
oof  pedro pascal is overrated  and the  representation  is out of control. i keep getting a 505 mid eye roll. i m gonna go outside and let some wind blow through my ears.
watch it flop harder than strange world.
remember about last of us movie woke .....
brokeback pedro
rome is collapsing!
i m so tired of this constant propaganda shoved into everything
i really don t get the love for pedro. he s a terrible actor..
that movie will make 100 dollars and die
i m fine with people making films that focus on gay people but they cross the line when they start adding things to original properties without the consent of the original creator.

18 03 june is the month of the goddess ishtar  basically  she is an ancient mesopotamian goddess and her worship is exactly the same as the entire lgbtq movement. one of the demons of satan. so your dead accurate with demonic oppression.
remember when westerns used to be like this  https   youtu.be ohw1ui1nsmu
at least  queer  is accurate. i always thought  gay  played into the frivolous  light-in-the-loafers  dylan mulvaney image of homosexuals.
i swear why does everything have to be gay
lol.....amen
oh no really
dont you mean pedro gaycal
yeah..... not seeing this one....lol
sell outs. i have no idea why they think the future is like this
in uganda it is illegal to be gay up to capital punishment in some cases. at least countries like these don t have to put up with gay propaganda.
bbm was also heath ledger and jake gyllenhaal. that helped its success. it also came at a time when woke wasn t being shoved down everyone s throat. short story is pedro will fail. the gay western will fail. some will eventually fail. anything built on the back of anger held together by mutual hatred will eventually eat itself.
smdh
why does it offend you
i d rather just watch john wayne movies.
pedro is a mediocre actor at best.
ugh!
go woke! go broke!!!!!!!!!!!
oh ffs.
at some point  you have to accept reality and accept the truth.  believing in god  heaven  and hell is reality  ummmm
the phrase we re looking for might be   put it back in the closet  you re not welcome out anymore .
this is disgusting
i have no need for yet another gay western.
small hats have a big  gay agenda.
almodovar is one of the greatest spanish directors ever. this is your most ill-informed and ignorant video. todo sobre mi madre was a massive hit.
that s the actual title  that s like making the trans day of visibility april fools. it s insulting to the people it s made for.
atheist argument...nothing created everything  then what created our universe. nothing  how can nothing create everything  god ...thas how .....just one god and a whole lot of luv.  i passed away during an operation a couple of years back  but thankfully  i was resuscitated. wasn t my time. i can say  the gates are real.  thas how far i went. js
is an almodovar movie. nothing woke about this movie.
this is literally an over 20 minute video answering that exact same question
i ve still got a bunch to watch. i just watched the sons of katie elder.
the f ck
gay cowboys. my favorite westerns.
i don t like pascal..he is not attractive to me and he is not great actor either. social media has what made him so popular.
another brokeback mountain  huh  not that surprised  but....whatever
they are turning the frogs gay
what is happening with your room  just the new testament  dont like the old one.
brokeback mountain wasnt a western! it was just a gay love story with guys in cowboy hats
will never ever ever watch this.
everything is gay and trans now. we re surrounded by it
this is gross
...sounds disgusting.
why must be everything be lgbt
pedro gayboi
jesus said there would be great tribulation that would come on the whole inhabited earth.   and unless god intervene  nobody would survive   i believe that s ww3
coming from a real cowboy   this is disgusting .
the only good modern western as of now is  the english  series with emily blunt ... it has strong feminist vibes  but is watchable
why do you always talk about your assumption of things instead of actually viewing them
oh boy here we go. queer cowboys eating vanilla pudding.
we are living in satans world.. so why are you shock
every modern movie male character is a gay simp while every modern female movie character is a tough manly  hairy armpits lesbian.
they re not doing the gay community any favors by taking all the novelty away from gay cowboys. make a movie about gay ninjas for a change.
1 john 2 15-17 15 love not the world  neither the things that are in the world. if any man love the world  the love of the father is not in him.16 for all that is in the world  the lust of the flesh  and the lust of the eyes  and the pride of life  is not of the father  but is of the world.17 and the world passeth away  and the lust thereof  but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever. hello the good news is that if you believe that jesus christ died on the cross for your sins  was buried and rose again the third day  you will be saved and have eternal life  this is the gospel  the good news  1 corinthians 15 1-4 1 moreover  brethren  i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you  which also ye have received  and wherein ye stand 2 by which also ye are saved  if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you  unless ye have believed in vain.3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received  how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 4 and that he was buried  and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures   only jesus christ can save you and give you eternal life! john 14 6  jesus saith unto him  i am the way  the truth  and the life  no man cometh unto the father  but by me.  1 corinthians 6 9 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god  be not deceived  neither fornicators  nor idolaters  nor adulterers  nor effeminate  nor abusers of themselves with mankind  10 nor thieves  nor covetous  nor drunkards  nor revilers  nor extortioners  shall inherit the kingdom of god.  but if you are washed clean by the blood of the lamb of god  1 corinthians 6 11 and such were some of you  but ye are washed  but ye are sanctified  but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus  and by the spirit of our god.  btw.1 john 2 18 little children  it is the last time  and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come  even now are there many antichrists  whereby we know that it is the last time.  regardless if you believe it or not  d.j.trump is the  last  antichrist aka the beast  and the pope is the false prophet from revelation 13 11revelation 13 11 and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth  and he had two horns like a lamb  and he spake as a dragon.  it looks like  a lamb  aka like a christian  but it speaks like a dragon aka satan  this is the pope!maranatha
gay dudes would never join a cattle drive
i d prefer to watch gina carano s western movie rather than this slop. hers sounds way more interesting than this.
gay cowboys will never again attain the high water mark effortlessly reached by kirin j callinan  and jimmy buffett  in the song big enough . what is the point in saying less than your predecessors
why do you care so much
a ho  woman of low repute  is killed in town. 2 gay cowboys  that effects us how  she was a transwoman! to the anti-oppression poneys! we ride!
yup... looks pretty gay
it s a pedro almodovar film. he is a queer so of course his film is about gay men. shame.
such a shame. john wayne would ve killed it in this role. what a load of crap.
i agree  take the rainbow back. i don t know why it became the symbol for homosexuality
ok girl i ve been supporting your channel. and i agree with every right winged view you shared. however the fact you mentioned not condoning anything that harms my spirituality... excuse me  as a gay christian  i am done conflicting with myself my whole life. i have the right to love and be loved. your anti gay statement is getting too far. and you need to simmer down. you have no ideas there are a group of gays supporting you and by saying this you are losing followers.please reflect and think before you engorge your self righteous extreme right rhetorics and it s no wonder you encounter someone who s stalked you. extremism always attract other extremists. js.
interesting  but what you say you know is a fictional story. good for you  but it s just as dangerous preaching religion over spirituality  decency and common sense.
brokeback mountain was suuuper boring.
gay cowboys eating pudding.
no thanks
1st
why is israel our greatest ally
yes! i love gay     ! i love gay westerns  i love gay cowboys - especially the ones in space - i love gay horses  i love gay hats  i love gay chaps  i love those       gay pointy boots with fancy tips and little spurs that tinkle when i strut
they still haven t apologized for killing jesus.
melonie sometimes people are just gay lol not everything gay is woke
hateful and abusive.
youve kind of lost me with your message. there are many more pressing ramifications for the  woke  agenda  do as you please believe in god  be gay  but sex should never be the goal for anything youth related. these people may burn in hell  but i am more worried for the children that are constantly being inundated with sexual themes. gender should be left to science and sex should be on the parents to teach the children not drag queens and gay westerns.
lazy videos.
is westerns a story with pre established characters  nois it a set fanbase who want only straight people  noso why complain. if you don t want to watch this then no problem... its a new story... its not an attack it might just be cringe or bad but not bad...this is a little silly as a video idea. it s just hating for the sake of hating.... i don t see the problem for this one.
i am no longer a christian but i also don t like lgbt propaganda.
dude  it s just a movie. so what if the characters are homosexuals  they aren t being woke.
woke is heavily based around the promotion of biblical immorality  so yes  a show about a gay couple is woke. that s about as woke as you can get.
hello you wrote quote  i am no longer a christian  so my question is have you ever believed the gospel 1 corinthians 15 1-4  1 moreover  brethren  i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you  which also ye have received  and wherein ye stand 2 by which also ye are saved  if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you  unless ye have believed in vain.3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received  how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 4 and that he was buried  and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures   aka  if you believe that jesus christ died on the cross for your sins  was buried and rose again the third day  you will be saved and have eternal life .if your answer is yes  then you are born again  but if you believe that one becomes a christian by being  baptized with water by a catholic or protestant minister  then you have never been a christian!read john 3 1-21 1 there was a man of the pharisees  named nicodemus  a ruler of the jews 2 the same came to jesus by night  and said unto him  rabbi  we know that thou art a teacher come from god  for no man can do these miracles that thou doest  except god be with him.3 jesus answered and said unto him  verily  verily  i say unto thee  except a man be born again  he cannot see the kingdom of god.4 nicodemus saith unto him  how can a man be born when he is old  can he enter the second time into his mother s womb  and be born 5 jesus answered  verily  verily  i say unto thee  except a man be born of water and of the spirit  he cannot enter into the kingdom of god.6 that which is born of the flesh is flesh  and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.7 marvel not that i said unto thee  ye must be born again.8 the wind bloweth where it listeth  and thou hearest the sound thereof  but canst not tell whence it cometh  and whither it goeth  so is every one that is born of the spirit.9 nicodemus answered and said unto him  how can these things be 10 jesus answered and said unto him  art thou a master of israel  and knowest not these things 11 verily  verily  i say unto thee  we speak that we do know  and testify that we have seen  and ye receive not our witness.12 if i have told you earthly things  and ye believe not  how shall ye believe  if i tell you of heavenly things 13 and no man hath ascended up to heaven  but he that came down from heaven  even the son of man which is in heaven.14 and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness  even so must the son of man be lifted up 15 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish  but have eternal life.16 for god so loved the world  that he gave his only begotten son  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish  but have everlasting life.17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world  but that the world through him might be saved.18 he that believeth on him is not condemned  but he that believeth not is condemned already  because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god.19 and this is the condemnation  that light is come into the world  and men loved darkness rather than light  because their deeds were evil.20 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light  neither cometh to the light  lest his deeds should be reproved.21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light  that his deeds may be made manifest  that they are wrought in god.and this matthew 13 1-30 1 the same day went jesus out of the house  and sat by the sea side.2 and great multitudes were gathered together unto him  so that he went into a ship  and sat  and the whole multitude stood on the shore.3 and he spake many things unto them in parables  saying  behold  a sower went forth to sow 4 and when he sowed  some seeds fell by the way side  and the fowls came and devoured them up 5 some fell upon stony places  where they had not much earth  and forthwith they sprung up  because they had no deepness of earth 6 and when the sun was up  they were scorched  and because they had no root  they withered away.7 and some fell among thorns  and the thorns sprung up  and choked them 8 but other fell into good ground  and brought forth fruit  some an hundredfold  some sixtyfold  some thirtyfold.9 who hath ears to hear  let him hear.10 and the disciples came  and said unto him  why speakest thou unto them in parables 11 he answered and said unto them  because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven  but to them it is not given.12 for whosoever hath  to him shall be given  and he shall have more abundance  but whosoever hath not  from him shall be taken away even that he hath.13 therefore speak i to them in parables  because they seeing see not  and hearing they hear not  neither do they understand.14 and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias  which saith  by hearing ye shall hear  and shall not understand  and seeing ye shall see  and shall not perceive 15 for this people s heart is waxed gross  and their ears are dull of hearing  and their eyes they have closed  lest at any time they should see with their eyes  and hear with their ears  and should understand with their heart  and should be converted  and i should heal them.16 but blessed are your eyes  for they see  and your ears  for they hear.17 for verily i say unto you  that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see  and have not seen them  and to hear those things which ye hear  and have not heard them.18 hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.19 when any one heareth the word of the kingdom  and understandeth it not  then cometh the wicked one  and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. this is he which received seed by the way side.20 but he that received the seed into stony places  the same is he that heareth the word  and anon with joy receiveth it 21 yet hath he not root in himself  but dureth for a while  for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word  by and by he is offended.22 he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word  and the care of this world  and the deceitfulness of riches  choke the word  and he becometh unfruitful.23 but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word  and understandeth it  which also beareth fruit  and bringeth forth  some an hundredfold  some sixty  some thirty.24 another parable put he forth unto them  saying  the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field 25 but while men slept  his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat  and went his way.26 but when the blade was sprung up  and brought forth fruit  then appeared the tares also.27 so the servants of the householder came and said unto him  sir  didst not thou sow good seed in thy field  from whence then hath it tares 28 he said unto them  an enemy hath done this. the servants said unto him  wilt thou then that we go and gather them up 29 but he said  nay  lest while ye gather up the tares  ye root up also the wheat with them.30 let both grow together until the harvest  and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers  gather ye together first the tares  and bind them in bundles to burn them  but gather the wheat into my barn. so what is it  the lake of fire or eternal life only jesus christ can save you and give you eternal life! john 14 6  jesus saith unto him  i am the way  the truth  and the life  no man cometh unto the father  but by me.  maranatha
