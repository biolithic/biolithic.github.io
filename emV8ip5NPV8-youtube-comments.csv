the school alone is extremely amazing. the amount of detail they put into the castle. it s amazing
i really like it when people on twitter and the like realise that the world that they concocted online isn t at all what the real world is like.
my favorite cope that i ve seen so far   it s our world  not hers.  they obviously haven t seen her contract.
went to my local gaming shop and i can happily report that people are buying it like crazy and don t give a damn about the whining of the reactionary fools. congratulations on one fantastic year  and best wishes for 2023.
i ve been getting attacked left and right because i spoke up about this. it s insane that we are marked a bigot for playing the game. let alone now there s a website to track down streamers. thank you for pushing forward with your videos regarding this.
i love that they were so incredibly wrong about this game. keep up the amazing work. you ve changed my life with your content and i hope one day i get to truly say thank you
hogwarts  1998  wins the battle against voldemort.hogwarts  2023  wins the battle against wokemort.
i find it hard to drum up any sympathy for these people...like you said  the mob eats their own.  i truly do hope this opens some eyes to just how vile some of these people are  whole simultaneously cloaking themselves in false virtue.  i ve only played about an hour or so of the game so far but i think it s great!  can t wait to open up the world and play more!
to all those who are changing their minds after bullying others  never let them forget what they did. being eaten alive by your own audience  they deserve it for pandering to those people in the first place.
the funny thing is that jk wasn t even transphobic  she was just talking about the problem of all men being able to enter female safe zones  actually happened in my school when they put up a sign  girls and genderfluids   two boys tried to enter the girls  changing room like fr wtf
awesome! let s keep pushing them back! we needed this w and i can t wait to play as well. happy go boom birthday! i m so glad i found your channel and i m not going anywhere no matter how bad they want to cancel you.   have an amazing day please!
they can t go backwards after the past few months but in all seriousness even the discord server is getting harassed congratulations for the 1 year
honestly i really like the way they implemented the trans character in this game. it doesn t feel like tokenism  it doesn t feel forced  it doesn t feel like theyre there to make a political statement and glorify being trans  there s no scene with your character saying  wow your trans  you re so brave and amazing and strong . theyre just kind of there in the world living their life and that s how trans characters in media should be
congrats on 1 year and 115k subs  melonie.you make always great videos and are such a bright spot in my day. stay strong and never back down from sharing your faith and your views. i ll always be here to support you.
girlfriend reviews is a great channel. the bf for the most part plays the games the gf for the most part watches and offers a review as a backseat gamer. sometimes they ll co op. the content is a lot of fun if you game yourself.when shelby  the gf  tells one of the haters she d ban them herself if they didnt stop  i smiled. she stood up and i enjoyed it.their channel is a lot of fun. no doubt they ll be losing subs over this so i m recommending their channel. if we don t support people when they re attacked we re part of the problem. they may seemingly be left leaning but this is the eye opening moment most leftists experience that makes them question their ideals. support them now and gain another win in a gross culture war. or don t  just my two cents.also  melonie  keep up the great work.
activists backpedaling is glorious.
congrats on the 1 year anniversary! i m glad to be a part of your journey. you ve blessed me in many ways and you bless many more people.i m glad the woke mob is walking back on their statement on hogwarts legacy and giving it a chance now.you look great today. i m excited for you to stream hogwarts legacy!
this game is so good  you can tell how much thought and love they put into it. only thing i wish they added was quidditch and multiplayer. either way it s a great game.
i can t wait to play it like it s something we wanted for years and it s amazing we can play this. how can you not be excited about this as a harry potter fan
i ve seen one vtuber that was pressured into not playing the game at a scheduled time  not sure if she ll abandon it or delay it. meanwhile  some of the hololive girls are playing it and having fun. i watched moona play for a while last night  and it actually got me thinking about getting the game.
going to get it on switch in july .safe to say it ll be less amazing  but psyched!
@user-ug9hx7gj5m  i really hope the switch version surprises us all. it would be great to have a mobile version of this game that works
@user-ug9hx7gj5m  nah you ll love it. there is so much to the game that streamers won t be able to cover.
extremely amazing and amazing   eh  you need to enrich your vocabulary.
i think it ll be cloud based. no way they could manage to make it natively payable on current gen switch!
@vyacheslav794  tf you talking about
man it s no joke. i am so impressed with the school and all the details. it s crazy.
now if only the real world would hit them harder.actions have consequences.
they create their own illusion. they block people whose opinions they don t like  then when everyone else  who wasn t blocked because they agree with them  agrees with them  they think that their opinion is the most popular opinion.
they simply need to go outside without their phones open for a bit. they are constantly online somewhere  constantly on some kind of social media app. social media is not the real world. social media is fake. if these people left social media for a good amount of time  they might see how people in the real world actually are.
@g360live  i think you re stating some facts there. they live in their little worlds  thinking it s the big world  and don t know how to handle it when someone disagrees. it s really pretty sad what has happened to these people. a system that decided to take advantage of them instead of help them.
this game was made to be epic.
i had some guy tell me  it s okay if you don t know how business works  when i pointed out that this game is going to make jk a lot of money.
@terryhartung4159  yeah shes gonna get a ton of royalties from it like anything else with the hp ip.
why do people care if jk rowling the endlessly rich millionaire makes some more money off of this lol. this ain t exactly life changing money for her. but it probably will be substantial money for the many other developers who worked on this amazing game.
@xshipwrec  yeah  i mean  even if it wasn t for this game she has enough money anyway that it s not like she s going to go broke anytime soon lol.
now that s some 100  pure grade a delusion if i ve ever seen it.
@terryhartung4159  this way of thinking is like saying if you don t pour a few buckets of water into a see it will make the sea dry or hurt it in some way. however you can fil a pool with those buckets. super rich j.k rowling wouldn t be hurt but the developers will be. they 100  deserve to be paid for their great work.
@xshipwrec  she s a billionaire.  she is at the level where she never has to think about money... ever.
also  it wouldn t exist without her hard work in....well  creating the world. sick of people trying to separate a fictional world and the whole ip from the person who created them just because they don t fit this brave  new  absurd world. i m an aspiring writer and if this happens to me one day  i m not going to take it either.
@blackmage4501  oh i agree. the more it sells the better it works out for the developers which is awesome. everyone wins. but that particular fella s take was he didn t feel guilty buying it because she wasn t being rewarded for it. i just felt compelled to tell him that in fact she will make loads of money.
to be fair  there are a lot of creative that get screwed over by the entertainment industry. there are people that have popular songs that have been heard for decades that have were paid a relative small commission to write lyrics or compose arrange some element of the song that have no share in the royalties. other times creatives can sign up with terrible terms in their contracts. that was what the steven crowder v. dw was all about just this past month.  you really have to be careful what you sign up for in the entertainment industry.
i m actually debating on whether to get a physical copy  just so i can basically give these ppl a middle finger
awesome to hear!
most people aren t on twitter and don t care what people on twitter think.
twitter doesn t matter.
lol   reactionary  xdthat is a political term. it does not mean what you think it means
@fernandofaria2872  it can certainly be used within a political context  but it isn t strictly and only a political word. in general  it can be used to describe people who  react  to the very slightest and smallest of things. but i think i see what you mean.
@derekgregory  i didn t even know what was going on till i started looking up gameplay for the game  just made me want to buy it even more god these people are entertainment  so far the games a 9 out of 10
do they even know what the word  bigot  means  i m going to say no  because it actually fits the woke mob as a description.
yes  i could tell you were apprehensive about even talking about it  i am sorry people suck  missbubbles.
same just talking about playing the game gets you called all sorts of hateful things but what they re saying is far worse then anything jk rowling as ever said
@alcogod  probably no  keyboard ninjas recite things they ve seen others say most of the time
@alcogod  they ve tried to redefine it multiple times like they so often do
they have blunted the bigot sword to the point its a butter knife.
@alcogod  i was just thinking the same thing i don t think they know the definition of most things they talk about
i think someone on az s stream said that it was suspended. out of curiosity i checked myself and it comes up with  this service has been suspended by its owner.  there may be another one  but i think it s been dealth with.
@sammaclausegamgee  yep. when people say they re separating the work from the person they re adding to the actual problem of trying to silence people.
@xshipwrec  we care about her getting richer out of pure pettiness. because they have to make excuses to not feel bad about loving hp and we couldn t give a f less. it s funny to watch honestly.
star wars  star trek  and dr who fans  first time
@xshipwrec  genuinely bro. they re just harming the devs.
@terryhartung4159  just a drop in the bucket compared to what she makes from universal.. or i m betting the upcoming  reboot  of the series at warner bros. i don t know if she gets paid per game unit sold out just a flat out fee but this game was just a few nickels in comparison to what she ll make from her other contacts. on the other hand i m glad the game is doing well... i really loved disney infinity and avalanche getting some proper credit for their hard work.
but it s not their world. lol next level cope from these weirdos.
her name is literally on the boot up screen lmfao
that s literally the dumbest comment when she wrote the stories and created this world.
@terryhartung4159  welcome to the underlining philosophy of  death of the author.
exactly how a death eater would think
i find that hilarious.  she the author of that world.  it is hers by definition.  she s the god of that world.   someone may like the world she created  but they can t claim ownership of that world.
@terryhartung4159 you do realize there are way more lucrative streams of revenues that she collects from including orlando studios  lego s  the movies  toy sales  etc  how is this game out of everything getting all the specific hate when she didn t even participate in its creation  it s cause it s easy to get on twitter and complain about it and everyone jumps on the bandwagon to prove they are a good person. when to really make a real difference   there are many other things to boycott that would be actually significant. but it s all about virtue signaling. not following through and actually doing anything .
@chrisd_  so what    i don t know what you re trying to get at. she s worked hard and deserves it.
their world is a small rock orbiting jupiter
yes they own the world she created and still legally owns. riiiight.
@blackmage4501  and i bet you wonder why you re not rich. this is why. to stay rich you need to keep making more money. sure her books still sell but not enough to keep her bank account at the same level. life is expensive so you re constantly draining your bank account. if you don t refill your bank account you end up poor again. that s why she constantly needs new streams of income. when you spend money without making more you end up with none. that s how spending money works!
that s what star wars fans used to think...
@xshipwrec  nobody thinks jk is going to be poor  but they probably want to see more hp stuff. jk can retire  only her fans will be disappointed at this stage. if the game fails  there won t be any future hp games.
@johncrawford1979  yeah i hate creatives bitchin. there s plenty of people writing songs and writing stories. they knew what the industry was like. if they re good they make money  if they sux they don t. if you want steady income  get a job and join the slog like the rest of us. ditto with crowder  if you don t like the contract  say no thanks and move on.
@johncrawford1979  nah mate  its days of our lives  first world problems crap. millionaires fighting over not getting paid enough. talk about real problems drama queen.
who cares what adults playing dressup think
i ve always been anti feminist therefore against jkr for years with her leftist politics  still bought the game because a fan of harry potter.i also frequent blackpill forums and it s saddening to watch younger incels going the pathetic trans route thinking they will have power by mutilating their bodies.
aw thank you so much  god bless
@meloniemacgoboom  you are annoyed though deep down. because you know kids will be playing this game  which is exactly what you ve been complaining about. so by supporting this game  you are promoting the very thing you ve been fighting against.
@dagsby4685  just couldn t help venting yourself in the comments huh  well may god bless you anyways.
why so  characters creator allows for unholy levels of character customization  well  for melonie it s about the argument  not the actual problem. she s a youtuber  after all. don t know what kind of internal integrity you expected to see here.
the big guns has shown that s why they won. the  tranz  bartender. everything is forgiven lol
@normanreaddis  lmfao all they did was make its voice deeper. that s all lmfao. trans women in real life still look like dudes 90  of the time
@user-wx9rr7sg6j they need to pander even in a small minute detail. this is like msheu taskmaster using a male actor  that s should be  lol.
adava kadavra! all around
i played a bit yesterday and i was so invested  when i received my wand  i felt so fulfilled. also  the combat is satisfying. i can t wait until i learn more offensive spells. not much i can do damage wise with leviosa or accio on heavier enemies  being able to dodge roll and use protego has been life saving and i feel so empowered when i push back on enemies with so much flair and style.
indeed. as i always say  those who think they can t be evil are capable of the greatest evils.
@humrh2360  the villain is the hero of their own story.
@moderategamer3333  accio and levioso are actually huge damage boosts if you hit them with basic cast  or jedi force throw  while they re hovering. and because of the shield system  you should always have a red  yellow  and purple spell on your active bar  so you can break enemy shields--hitting a shield with the spell of a matching  color  breaks it.i really wish the game would let you do practice  practise  heh  duels so one can get better at timing.
@einherjarlucian  i appreciate the advice. i definitely have a better grasp of the mechanics now. soloing bandit camps and destroying spiders gave me more experience. accio has been great for extending combos while levioso aids in crowd control. i died enough times to figure out protego timing and spell combos.
don t be like them. that is a lot like cancel culture. shake the dust off your feet and ignore them.
@lingricen8077  as a christian  i understand the points of fighting back and indeed  i do support that. fight evil where it is  i agree  but remember this  we are not god. we can push them back  keep their indoctrination out of our schools and fight when they attack our faith  that is permissible. there is a fine line between justice and vengeance. it is not cowardice to know the difference between the two. remember we are allowed to seek justice but vengeance is god s alone.
they absolutely deserve it  its literally the only way these people will learn. we are in the situation we are now because all we ve done is ignore it and allow it to continue look where we are now. these people deserve no pity or mercy cause they sure as hell wouldn t have given it to you.
@tristanengland3874  unfortunately  it s not gonna be that simple. these aren t the kind of people who re going to just give up simply because their targets refuse to validate their histrionics. and you can t just wait for them to pick on someone their own size  because they never do. these are the kind of people who have gotten comfortable screwing around and never finding out  because they ve been protected from the consequences of their behaviors.it s like constantly playing with fire and never getting burned even though others suffer for it. sometimes  the only way people are going to learn not to play with fire is if they get burned.
@humrh2360  i know that. it s just  we should fight back if we must  but let s make sure not to go down dark paths in doing so as it is very easy to get lost in yourself.
@morganpike7612  you have a point. it may be time to fight like heck. with our voices and shouts  we must call out the grooming in our schools and the sinful agenda in which they propagate.
@tristanengland3874  i love how you can pick and choose. i remember not too long ago a group of christians trying to ban harry potter books because they were evil.
@tristanengland3874  unfortunately ignoring them is what caused this  if we were still  bullying   shaming  insane people and ideas like we use to  society would not be in the state it is in currently.. people ignore them  then they were force to apologize to them  and now any  slight  cause them to go into full blown attack mode. enough is enough.
@user-wx9rr7sg6j  this.like i said  we can t be afraid to do certain things just because these zoomer trash turned these acts into somethingb despicable
seriously  that s what started this
@raijyn2452  yeah  she tweted something on the lines   i support trans  i will march for trans but if you have a dick you shouldn t end up in a women s prison . and that was enough to send the sjw into a  reeeeeeeeeeeeeee  spree    . when she started clapping back they went completely insane and this is the result.
definitely  i thought of myself as a left leaning person but all the discourse about trans people and the mob agenda and everything made me change my mind so much.. my philosophy is now very much of live and let live but don t let anyone destroy your traditions and freedom. i don t understand why people are afraid of playing a game that s not harmful at all and is about kids using magic. the world is crazy rn
you care about bullying  which is a social justice issue. are you woke
honestly feels like a golden opportunity to get into streaming and get noticed tbh  i bet you get tons of subs just from opposing these shitheads.
@mrsjula777  i respect your introspection  as a bit of food for thought- it doesn t have to be  us vs them . personally i like to think of issues individually and try come to my own reasonable conclusions. hope your having a great day
honestly i m glad they didn t add multiplayer. not everything needs to become a live service game  which includes a lot of monetary aspects that beat down the player base. it would be fun however to play with friends but i kinda like the solo adventure so far.
i like multiplayer in predominantly single-player games when there aren t cheevos and trophies tied to them. i got into playing assassin s creed late and enjoyed getting all the cheevos for the first two games  but that s not possible with any of the later ones due to empty or no-longer-funtioning servers
damn no quidditch  that s lowkey disappointing to hear
@enigmatic..  if ur talking about the lady at the 3 broomsticks then yeah hahaha doesn t take away from the game tho.
@wellsjernigan3901  yea i completely agree  i just wanna play with my friends  like a co-op mode would be pretty neat.
@wellsjernigan3901  multiplayer makes games a lot less boring and more interactive
yeah i think she has decided to cancel it because it got bad for her aswell
@reddragonfire  i like that outside of en speaking countries  popular vtubers from the big companies are willing to play it. also  some of the phase connect   prism girls are in  although tenma got fed up with the chat in her waiting room and shut that down.
@eddielombardo  yeah some big vtubers did get pushback but they seem to roll with it but i can understand why tenma sometimes it s not worth it if it gets too bad
j.k. rowling haters   don t buy this game! it offends us! everyone  buys it to spite themj.k. rowling haters  surprised pikachu face
this is the game i ve been waiting for  for over 20 years  loving it and basically everything i ve wanted in the game.
i ve been having a blast with the game so far. god bless melonie!
they always backpedal.with the whole let s go brandon thing they went from  it s a right wind dogwhistle to incite violence  to  you guys are cowards who can t even say what you really mean  to  we never really cared and you guys look so dumb . they re like children despite their age
congrats on the one year mark. may the lord continue to bless you  use you  and keep you  melonie.
so ready for the live stream. and the wokies can just get over it. we re here for you melonie and we love you.
1 year  wow  that escalated quickly. you re great  just don t let it get to your head like so many so many youtubers
happy 1 year anniversary  melonie! much deserved congrats! all heckon  day!
girlfriend reviews got annihilated by one side for their takes on the last of us 2  and now the other side is attacking them for playing hogwarts. too many insane people out there that desperately need psychiatric help.
they can t stand to be left out of anything popular. now watch them making demands of the developers because  hogwarts legacy is for everyone!
i thinks the woke mob is gonna actually get worse now. they made a website where they can check whether or not a streamer has been playing the game. they are probably going to use it as a way of figuring out who they wanna cancel next. a bunch of streamers have already been ddos d just for playing the game as well.
i just want this to come out now. it genuinely looks awesome  especially the exploration.
congrats on the 1 year milestone and it s an honor to have found your channel and follow you  over the past few months i have really enjoyed  your take on social activities.
just found your channel. it s so refreshing to see a young female with your opinions that is strong enough to voice them.
this game is truly magical. it s sad that people will miss out on such a fun experience because of someone else s opinion.
congrats on the one year and many more to come. you re a delight  keep em coming!
i received the deluxe edition this morning  i live in france  and have played it for about an hour  will continue once my wife and kids are in bed tonight .the game is awesome  but the developers catered to the woke mob as  1- you can combine whatever  body type   male or female  and  voice type   male or female  you want. so you can create a male  female  transman or transwoman  which is fine  but...2- regardless of your character s gender type  you can choose in which dormitory you can sleep... meaning you can create a male character who will sleep in the women dormitory... which is creepy as f  k.
congrats mel on your anniversary  if nothing else all ways remember this going forward... if you re making people mad  then you re standing for what you believe in. i won t say stay strong or give you encouragement because that strength to stand must always come from within and if you can hold on to that  nothing will ever break you.
congratulations on your 1 year!   i bought the deluxe edition too just to support the developers and i am a potter fan!
im so happy that i just found you about a half year ago. your content just pushes me to say what i think and feel! gamers are just to silent about all this craze!
it s all americans that are this woke .they protest everything.i m a professional fighter.but i m scared anytime i m in the usa in chicago for my fights i hear gun shots seen murders .had gun fights during my fight well i was there .i witness this atifa gang .thought it was a skit when i first saw videos .and they where protesting something about trans men athletes not being able to complete against women.and i had my canadian car license plate and they smash my windows and thrown me out my vehicle i m a big guy but i thought i was gonna die i beg for my life. many you saw walk with guns .i don t know one canadian personally that s offended by j.k and harry potter.
saddest part is that the game is woke and bent the knee. i m willing to overlook it coz it looks awesome regardless  but the cult literally hates a game that bent the knee because someone not involved said something that was so milquetoast that it is hardly worth noticing.
as someone who worked on the ea hp games 10  years ago  i m sorry for what you got at the time.we knew what we were working on  but the movie tie-in was contractually obligated to be released. all of us in qa knew that the universe deserved a better class of hp game.i ve never even been a fan of the books in the first place  they re not for me  you do you   but i m genuinely glad all y all finally got the game you deserve.
ahh thank you so much! god bless you
beinging caught in 4k yes. love it
why do you spam so many comments its creepy
difference is they still made a video on tlou 2 despite that. they probably won t make a video on hl because i how horrible the woke mob has been. i hope they do make a video and weather the storm. because what is happening right now is evil.
you can create a male  female  transman or transwoman  which is fine  but...  are you sure  i m asking you again since you have kids. are you certain you re fine with that  how old is the character in the game  just asking curiously
@lastincome   how old is the character in the game indeed  good point.
the funniest thing aboutit is that a trans person could merely make a character of the gender they want. why do they need a male character in the female dorms
@lastincome  bro it s a world of literal fantasy and magic  it s fine  it makes sense. like letting you create a centaur or some shit.
@calumjones  yeah... sure. keep that argument when they have trans in children story books. they are just story books  right . not like it s harmful or anything  right
@lastincome  i m not bothered  the setting contains literal magical beings. it doesn t bother me whatsoever.
@calumjones  doesn t bother you  so you enjoy playing a teenager as a trans  wow... amazing.
i hope you know having a rough day got so much better seeing your new video. don t stop being you and spreading your messages! definitely becoming one of my fav
happy 1 year! i discovered your channel 2-3 weeks ago and wish i had discovered it sooner! thank you for your content
congratulations on a great year of content melonie
congrats on the anniversary  mel! here s to several more!!
congratulations on the 1 year anniversary for your channel. only started watching recently but addicted.
saw this scene today when i was playing the game.and i heard someone in game refer to my character as they.and i met a female character during a main mission that mentioned her wife.and i didn t give 2 shits about any of that  i m just enjoying the game.
congratulations on 1 year!i ve never been a potter fan nor will i ever be  tolkien yeah!   but i m glad you all are enjoying this game  especially since i read that previous games in that universe were average
amazing game  better than what i expected  the incredible detail had me wondering the castle looking at all the paintings and ghosts. 7 hours in and just done the first 2 classes done.
congrats on the one year anniversary! keep going boom!  3
congrats on the anniversary well deserved keep up the good work love your channel
congrats on the one year mark melonie  looking forward to many more videos ahead.  thanks for all you do.
congratulations  melonie! i have been watching  for about 9 months. it s just a game  folks. i m glad you are playing. woke eats their young. i glad some of them walked back  but i know they knowingly picked a losing side because they want to be victims.  you look beautiful   thank you for your videos.
the strange thing is why have a male voice if you re a trans women with magic  you literally can use magic potions to change your voice  it is something wizards do all the time when they take the form of someone else. only the movies kept the voices the same  not the books. they just highlight the strangeness.unlike cyberpunk with clair who is a trans women who doesn t yell her identity out.
congratulations and happy anniversary for your new channel. this game might help your original channel get back up and running well. keep up the grind.
theres actually some pretty nasty clips of hogwarts streamers crying after their chat is filled with haters
congrats on 1 year and 115k subs  mel! very much deserved! i told you on the first vid you made here that by the end of this channel s 1st year you would have 110k-120k subs and i was right! keep up the amazing work friendo! it s hilarious that the woke mob think s they won when they clearly didn t because the wanted the game to fail and it is a massive success! it s sad and pathetic that they are bullying  harassing and hating on ppl for just wanting to play a harry potter game  most of whom like harry potter. i can t wait for us all to clown on the woke mob on stream!
congrats on your 1 year anniversary! discovered your channel about a month ago and it s great seeing someone push back against all the woke nonsense. keep it up!
i m about 8 hours in and i m loving it.  i ve never really been a harry potter fan  but i d recommend the game for anyone who likes rpgs
i m really wondering how they thought this would work. you didn t see people trying to ban minecraft because notch was a horse s rear end. just have fun with the game. and happy birthday to melonie mac go boom! are you getting a boom-cake
gratz for your anniversary  love your straightforward approach
its all virtue signaling. the game catered to these freaks and they still hate it... hilarious!
@themightycrixus1131  i guess it just gave another piece of evidence of why they ll choose to remain in their hatred.
average gamers generally do not care about woke aspects put into a game  me personally i don t care but it depends on the game.
it s funny that they think we actually care about that scene. we are existing in a game world where we can literally turn human enemies into wooden barrels  why would we care about a guy that changed into a chick
@nastynate46  i m playing it right now and i m having a blast.
i m so utterly confused! what do you even mean
see here s the thing  they get no sympathy from me. you cannot expect any when you pander to the weirdos and then act surprised when they turn on you. we see this time and time again.
happy birthday to your channel melonie!! keep sticking to your morals and bringing us the unfiltered content! another victory for the non-woke populous!
it hasn t been even mildly disappointing  it s been just about the best piece of hp we ve seen in a while
congrats on one year! love the content!
congrats on one year! keep going boom girl!!!!!
don t let the bullies win  stay strong! god bless!
a few streamers i watch are avoiding it  kinda disappointed they have no spine. guess it takes things like this to show true colors even if they meant no harm. it shows character in the end
being pre-debut vtuber  i have immersed myself in their little world of pronouns and insecurities  and i ve found quite a few who are just.. well  normal people  just trying to get through life while rattling as few cages as they can.  unfortunately they re too few  and most of them feel like they have to chase clout to get popular and have an audience.  the ones that don t  the ones that just have faith in their own content and abilities - they re the ones i like  no matter where they sit on the sociopolitical spectrum.  some of them have gone ahead and given the middle finger to the haters and are streaming this  and man i love it.  i feel like it s a small but significant upheaval in that community and it needs to happen.
loving the content melonie and happy birthday to your channel
regardless of who actually said this  it is true   no one can make you feel inferior without your consent no such thing as online bullying unless you allow it.
i truly wish i could empathize with them  but i ve just truly never tried to appease a cult or cared what they think so i have a hard time relating.
i think it s safe to say the blue-hairs got avada kedavrad on this one.
shelby is a sweetheart. it shows how vile these people are to be attacking her.
happy 1 year melonie! here is to many more!
happy one year  melonie! i m interested in checking out hogwarts legacy.
you are an absolute boss melonie. got this game ready to go and although the sorting hat might also consider me for gryffindor it is going to be hufflepuff all the way.
im sad i took so long to find this channel. love your content and you are amazing to watch.
wieners can be weapons  had me dying lolol.
congrats on the subs and the year of based content. we need more uppity gals like yourself.
i m surprised at how hard  hard mode  really is. i never expected to get 3 hit in a harry potter game. good game
as much as i like gf reviews  they brought this on themselves.the kept saying  but we are allies  during the stream. the real excuse that gf reviews kept using during this stream is  listen  we re just doing our job! it s pretty pathetic.
i don t think saying  we are allies  is bad by itself. weird people on the internet take it way too far to the point that you get situations like this
nothing wrong with fighting injustice. but the weirdos aren t fighting injustice. they are just fighting.
but it is true
weiners can be weapons  -melonie 2023
let s go team hufflepuff! congrats on your anniversary!
i can t wait for this game  ignore the haters ... and happy 1st birthday to your channel melonie  you are a amazing hostess  great content too  take care
that tweet about all the people getting to the trans character part say a lot about their mindset rather than the players.  to them anyone who bought this game hates trans people  instead of people  you know  just buying a game.  it isn t that serious and just show out of proportion ridiculous they are being.
happy birthday!  really enjoy your content and no-nonsense outspokenness!
happy bday mm! great content  love your love of all things tomb raider. been wanting to revisit old titles on steam.
stay strong. we have your back.
i ve just done 15 straight hours on this game and i love it highly recommend
been playing 14 hours straight.  needed a break  so i wanna see what mel s gotta say lolgame is fun!  them abominations can keep crying.  the more ridiculous they get  the more people will ignore them.  they try too hard for attention like they are something special  but no one cares what they do with their lives.  i want them to stop trying to change the world into their sick delusional fantasy.
i have to work customer service and have had to deal with this four almost 5 years now. . i have had to deal with all matter of vile disgusting crap including i once had to deal with an alphabet soup person and i was told to please this person and  do whatever makes tnem happy  or i d be fired told satisfy the alphabet person help  make them happy  or ill be fired so i m using that as the most extreme i ve had to deal with. i have to deal with awful people all day every day so if anyone is pushed to crying by voiceless chats  let me help you out. there s this magical button called block. block and report. all i can do is mute the call. to you just dealing with chat text messages  mute block report. and not to rub in any salt but text message chat is no where near as bad as actually talking to them and almost never can you hang up on them
8 54  wieners can be weapons  mel is a hopeless romantic!
melonie high-key asking us to contribute to her harry potter collection  for her birthday  teasing
hbd. i don t necessarily agree with all of your views  but i absolutely admire your courage to be you and very publicly voice your opinions. this whole boycott is insane and i hope there s and turning point within society that will completely mute these insane  woke  assholes.
i m playing it on my deck and it s outrageously good.  this is making their loss even better
keep up the great work melanie!!
when you have people getting booted from you stream have the ending message say  tell your mama she owes me child support  lol.looking forward to the stream
the game is amazing and it shows the interior of the castle is beautiful
woke cult failed players   it s a win win and it is so satifying. they even stoop this low to attack their own people. from this point they are just like wild dogs barking on everyone.happy anniversary to your channel btw.
hooray for one year of melonie mac go boom!
counting the days down to download and play! sooo excited!!
rofl i am gonna steal this line
woot! nice to see a fellow hufflepuff. i don t get their reasoning. there are tons of other fandoms out there  just move on to another but no  they re so bored and petty they dive right into the haterade.
blue hair weirdos   we are here to kill this game      actual gamers  hp fans   it was foolish of you to come here tonight  tom.
it s almost like the character didn t dance around waving a flag and scream in our face saying  stop killing us . nah. character was just a nice part of the scene and gave us a drink.
so much wisdom. thanks for speaking out.
weiners can be weapons  - melonie mac
the left eats itself. happy yt birthday melonie  so glad i found your channel it s so refreshing
this game is so magical. open world  combat  outfits  music. everyrhing is top notch. only things i that actually feels cringy is character expressions. feels like a ps3 game  but other than that  a solid 9 10 for me.
been discussing this game with my wife - she didn t want me dropping  70.00 on a game until the reviews came out. well  so far i haven t heard anything  bad  about the game - the worst thing i heard was  i kill an awful lot of people for being a 15 year old wizard...  which just sounds cool!
going to be getting the game on steam tonight. can t wait to play it.
this game is fantastic. and so are your videos!
these  people   love to cry being bullied when they are the bullies themselves and it s sad to see
did you hear what was in the game as well  there are some youtubers saying that the cook in the game is a transgendered person so them calling people terfs for playing a game that has a trans person in it makes them terfs themselves lol7 42 violence is never the answer is what i would like to say  but then i wonder how long could this go on and laugh at how the world has becomeand congratulations melonie on your first year of content
i ve barely even played dead space  but i m probably going to pick this up. wb s got to be loving that chik-fil-a effect this game has had.
over 115k subscribers in 1 year. you must be doing something right.  and drink water.
this game is cool! everything i wanted in a harry potter game.
i ve lost friends over my love of this game. i don t regret it the game is beautiful and well worth the hype wait. don t need that toxicity in my life.
in the world you will have struggles  but take heart  i have overcome the world
good stuff. keep doing what you re doing.
can not wait to get home from work tonight and give this game a play
can t wait to mod all the wokeness out of this game  that s why it s always better on pc. i can use a skin mod for this character and make him look like a proper dude. i don t want this kind of stuff affecting my journey into this game  plenty of it in the real life already. let me escape reality  i want to play a wizard in a fantasy story not a wizard in california.
wait 2 days and save 10  that will endear you to the wife for looking after the finances
happy birthday melonie for your channel. i m a big fan of your channel .looking forward to your live stream for hogwarts legacy
with all the reviews and backlash i went for it and pre ordered the normal edition  for sure its gonna be a fun experience
yesterday i was talking to someone and he said that kids have the ability to make rational decision for themselves so they re not being forced to do these drag shows sexualizing them and to accept some ideology. he was also trying to say that because so many people take medication for their mental health that it s a good thing while jk rowling is hurting people.
happy 1 year anniversary melonie!
you better stream that game  and i hope it s the most popular stream you ve ever had.
i would personally like to thank the lunatics losing their minds over this game. it was never on my radar because i can t stand hp  however since these nutjobs were going apoplectic i absolutely had to check it out. spent 3 hours with it last night and absolutely love it. so thanks to these losers i have a new game to enjoy that otherwise i never would have bought
i m gonna order it right now because i don t like to see good things under attack for evil purposes.
i m not even a harry potter fan but the way i see it is  you play or watch the games or shows you like  no one has got the right to jump on someone especially their own stream and bully them for enjoying something just because they don t like it themselves!! that s bs to me  just let people be fgs does my head in btw long time fan of yourself melonie mac  hope your well  -
wish i could help support these streamers but i don t want spoilers!
i m not even a harry potter fan and even i m enjoying myself. but then again i bought it out of spite. glad it worked out in the end.
congrats on the 1 year anniversary! over 100k subscribers in a year is awesome! i wonder how long it ll take to hit 250k  i m guessing under 6 months  tops.
i m about 4 hours in and it is really really great! the trans character is perfectly fine. they are just a character who fits into the world and zero attention is brought to it in game. the characters just treat them as just another person. exactly how it should be
happy one year anniversary melonie.
happy 1 year birthday melonie great work keep it up !
i ordered the game after watching a stream of it on playstation access. i found out about all this hate for it afterwards as i m not on social media. it made me even happier that the game is on it s way to me. can t wait to play!
100  agree. it is confirmed again worldwide that those who claim to be open-minded and tolerant are the most intolerant people.
exactly as you predicted
i don t watch streams  but gfr never had any politics in their videos in youtube. and if they had  it was lowkey  it didn t even registered with me.also  shelby seems like such a fun and nice person  and to hear people brought her to tears on steam. that s messed up.
i appreciate you covering this topic. i m absolutely disgusted by those  woke  people trying to ruin people over a damn video game. and even more disgusted that they bully the poor streamers  especially when they had the audacity to make one twitch streamer cry! this disgusting behavior really needs to stop and focus on something better else to do then to get pissed off over a freaking video game.
props to you for making a stand mate.
they don t  fit into the game  because it s a universe where magic exists. with magic they wouldn t be trans  they would just be a woman  not an in-between hybrid.
it makes sense they would exist in the game. the only way they would ever exist normally is by magic. since in reality they are just fucking insane.
@sekrewson  doesn t the game take place in the 1800 s  not many trans walking around those days lol if any
@idiot_city5244  that s what i m saying they are fictional made up magical creatures.
i watched half an episode of a let s play and preordered. was interested before  but was going to wait
that s their method of operation  pretend it didn t happen despite being caught in 4k
@meloniemacgoboom  defo  it is obvious to everyone except themselves!! anyways  enjoy the game  i cant wait to get it installed
it s a really fun game @melonie go boom you will absolutely love it. i am only an hour into story and i can t put it down.
weaners can be weapons  melonie 2023
girlfriend reviews bent the knee during the 2020 riots  that s when i stopped supporting them. i believe i remained subbed but turned off notifications and took  em out of my recommendations. my point is  i didn t attack them for their stance  i just distanced myself from them. to be fair  they do seem like really good people who want to do the right thing  s  but are severely misguided in their actions and approach. i don t like seeing them suffer this crap but at the same time they need to learn what the side they chose is really all about. if they do and do something about it  i ll be more than happy to give them my support again.
melonie is eye candy and i like seeing her.
can t wait for another year on this channel.
i haven t pre ordered the game since i m not a fan of pre ordering stuff  but so far it s looking like this will be a fun game to buy for this 10 days of work imma have soon
happy youtube birthday mel! stick it to the haters!  d
hogwarts legacy is about to go live in germany in half an hour. so i got a coffee  some snacks and mel s video on. today is a good day.
happy birth channel day
the game is beautiful and there is no sane reason not to play it.
wieners can be weapons.  quote of the day
enjoy your stream silly badger!
big l s all around hahaha. i can t wait until i can afford my copy of hp  i m gonna go nuts being a lil sneaky snek hehe.  slytherin!  it s ridiculous to me that they re so  inclusive  of everybody except those with differing opinions lol. after i woke up from the mob mentality  i started looking into jkr s tweets and i found myself agreeing with her... that was such a big turning point for me. keep up the great work  melonie  and enjoy the game!! xx
they think it s virtuous to bully and spew hate. they are evil
i didn t even think of sirona as trans  just a woman with a more masculine appearance and voice. she s also really cool and badass regardless of how she identifies.
i love girlfriend reviews content. my main question is what the heck were the moderators doing
the only gripe i have is the release of it on next gen consoles first  especially considering the lack of ps5 availability in the uk. i think financially that was a bad move. but looking at the specs  i wonder if older consoles will actually be able to run it anyway.
people are so insane. you can tell who the real bullies are.
happy one year anniversary! they took a huuuuuge l  they re attempt s failed
pretty insane that the whole hate campaign had the exact opposite effect
that s because she was written as a character first. not some mouthpiece of the writer to air a grievance. which is why sirona didn t talk about being trans nor whine about being oppressed.
hey melonie. love the hufflepuff shirt. you look amazing.
i honestly don t do video games anymore.   but this news has me. roflmao .and happy birthday to your channel!
happy channel birthday!  hufflepuff represent!  you ll have to give shadiversity a hard time about dogging on hufflepuff next time you re on friday night tights.
it s always nice to see the woke forced to eat their words. and congratulations on your 1st year!
haha   they swapped out voices at the last minutewhat a win
weiners can be weapons  i legit laughed out loud
im level 9 already in the game and im enjoying it! i only wish there was a morality system where being evil corrupts your appearance and vise versa. other than a few graphic problems here and there  the game is incredibly fun
the game is amazing!!!!!! i can t stop playing
these people remind me of talking to my ex wife.  when we say we don t care what we mean is ....we don t care.  there is no hidden meaning or repressed ism or phobe.  so when we say we don t care if you are trans...we mean we don t care if your trans.  heck some of us might even play along with you to a certain point.  the point where we draw the line is when it affects people besides you.  when it only affects yourself you can do anything you want ....however we expect....no....we demand that same tolerance in return.
wow  you ve been on for a year and you have 115 000 subscribers  when i saw you on friday night tights last year  i thought you were on longer.i subscribed just to add you to my deck cards of differing perspectives and takes on culture.
good for you taking a stand and not following the hate mob.
i m not a potter fan. still ordered games as gifts    i ve been wearing a  jesus plays hogwarts legacy  t-shirt  a mate printed for us all. went to a modest launch party then a couple pubs. good evening had  lots of lefty salt  loved it.
i never got into harry potter  never read the books or watches the movies. but i pre ordered the game on ps5 just because of the whole woke bs.congratulations on the 1 year!!
i d watch ur stream but i wanna play it blind  but you go girl stick it to the wokies
i think i ve got 5-6 hours into this game so far  it s fantastic. i m not even that big of a hp fan. i ve watched some and enjoyed it  but i m no die hard fan. this game will actually make me go back and watch them all as the lore just is cool as hell.i m glad you mentioned the transgender character that s in it. i actually don t mind it  and would be fine with more of their representation if this is how it will be done. as you said  it s not in your face. and to add onto that  it s also a new character  not a pre-existing one that is.....now trans.these extremist alphabet people can eat shit if they think they are going to win in the end lol. my twitch channel ain t much  and they probably won t due to how low down the list i ll be  but i hope they stop on by and try to bully me lol
the haters are just so desperate to be victims
if i had a nickel for every trans bar-maid in rtx aaa game i ve seen  i d have two nickels.which isn t much  but it s weird that it happened twice.p.s. nobody tell az  i want to see him relive his trauma unprepared.
that game omg so freakin good... hopefully they make a small update to be able to sit on chairs lol
i agree with you about how kids should be able to be kids and not have any kind of blockers or surgery until they are adults but i do think trans people should have representation in movies and games because no matter if people like it or not they are here so i am fine with there being a trans woman in the game and being able to make a trans character to play as. all that said no one will ever force their beliefs on me or stop me from doing something i want to do and that s why tomorrow i will be streaming this as well  i do it as a hobby so not a big channel at all  so fuck all the haters who will cry about anyone who is playing and streaming the game
yooooooooooo  the game is pretty dope!!! i m impressed we got a release that not only is actually finished and works but is really good also
but the bun is always a trap.
happy channel birthday melonie! i ve been here from the start and ain t going no where!
moral of the story  no matter what mess you will do  a couple of days and it s all dust.  if you get death sentence  you will be dust as well tho
115k subscribers in your first year  congrats melonie!
i had a feeling some wokies were going to do this. next time this happens we should all place bets on which woke ally is gonna end up playing the next controversial game.
i m not even a harry potter fan but i may buy this game just to buy it
so in a world where people can turn into animals  or completely change themselves into a whole other person....people are amazed at someone with a slightly different voice to how they look
happy anniversary!  here is to many more.
i m okay with girlfriendreviews being somewhat progressive  at their age  it s what i would expect.  i hope they re doing okay and they still find success in the future.  the one good thing i see from the attack is now girlfriendreviews understand and their eyes are open to the evil of the people attacking them.  i encourage everyone to welcome girlfriendreviews to our support.
congrats on the anniversary!
all heckin  day!!   got to love it!!!  you go   my  girl!!!! mine should be here tomorrow i hope.  i will also be playing it  all heckin  day .
the left leaning almost always change their tune due to their own communities. i was heavily left leaning until i had a conversation with mother that had her saying men should be forced to have a vasectomy. needless to say we disagreed.
cruel people are just that. looking for validation to do all the cruel things they love and feel justified and excused at the same time.
girlfriend reviews is hilarious and they are awesome people. i m more on the conservative side but i don t let that control which content creators i like and watch. people letting politics control their lives are ridiculous.
hooray happy 1 year of melonie mac go boom!
an outstanding game both me and my wife are loving it so far  the only issue i have with the trans bartender is it s the 1800s so trans didn t exist at that time i prefer historical accuracy  in saying that i m anti political correctness knew it was a bad idea when it was introduced    but whatever it doesn t faze me much hopefully ill unlock broom sticks  today.thank you j.k rowling for creating an incredible universe that billions of people love and thank you wb games for creating an amazing game the level of detail is insane gameplay and story is addictive as hell i can t wait to start flying although i really hope they add new game plus to make an incredible game that much better
its no surprise they dont want to take accountability. everyone wants to be on the side of right and wrong. but without christ in their life  they have no idea what is up and what is down. happy youtube birthday! dont forget us christian supportors!
happy 1 yr birthday beautiful lady. keep up the great content.
the stealth mission allowing men to dress as women to gain access to the girls locker room and restrooms is stunning and brave
happy anniversary i watch every show and i m also watching your old videos. so every i go boom!!!!!! lol
i feels amazing to be a part of the 99  and not being inside that 1  cult.
it looks absolutely amazing  even on my potato machine
we all knew that these people didn t have the  balls  to stand by their boycott.
i ve been so into the game that i didn t even hear about the streaming drama till yesterday and it s already over. progress
they dont want us telling them what to do with their bodies   dont tell us what we can play
this game is just great. if this is what avalanche nad port key gives us on their first try  i can t wait to see where they take the wizarding world in the future. maybe a stand-alone quidditch game since that was cut from hogwarts legacy
have a good day miss mac  great video and god bless!
you know you have principles when a slight breeze blows and you change your opinion.
i m pretty sure polyjuice potion didn t change ones voice  just an appearance  correct me if i got this wrong   so some guy looking like a lady in wizarding world  not the weirdest part honestly   d
happy youtube birthday!!! i came late to the party but you re super awesome  i m really glad i some how found your channel!!
they are releasing news articles trying to tell us about twitch livestreamers asking people on twitter to not stream on twitch until hogwarts legacy ads are gone lol
they still bullied and tried to cancel people  in at least one case with the community manager of limited run games actually succeeding  just for looking forward to this game. i m not going to let these sociopathic bullies forget about this  trying to ruin people s lives over a video game.
lmao  i didn t even think that barkeep was transgender.  i was just laughing thinking they put the wrong voice on the character.  too freaking funny.
happy anniversary  keep it up
game is amazing. apart from stutter issues and all. waiting for day 1 patch to fix few things.
i m gonna play the game  but i m not streaming. i m not the streaming type. if i did stream  and people were bullying me  i d laugh too. these people are so miserable because they are constantly on poisonous social media. they don t know how actual real life people act.
there is a website you can go to answer some questions and it will sort you to the right house in the potterverse lol
would appreciate a video on wookieepedia s insane decision to force gender ideology into their pages for literally every character now by listing their  pronouns  right after their gender - despite the obvious fact that this is redundant.
i guess going after actual hate groups is hard. let s point all our rage at a video game. that ll make em take us seriously.
just found channel  was looking at the game and you pop up  had to catch up alil on some of your videos and enjoy your content. keep it up and love your sleeve btw can t wait to start on my next one  it gets addictive lol
i m like 5 hours into early access. the game is amazing  one of best i ve ever played! jk rowling only stated facts and defended real women.
there s an old saying  different strokes for different folks  and i believe in that. if you don t feel comfortable supporting something then you don t have to  and that s fine. but to go after it and the people who don t feel the same way you do is just vitriolic and wrong. the sheer poison people are getting thrown at them for playing this game is just sad. i have no idea how anyone could be so spiteful and hate filled while simultaneously being totally convinced they are the virtuous ones. this is bad and these people should feel bad.
happy first anniversary for the channel!
get ready 20 minutes to a wizarding adventure. i will be streaming hogwarts legacy as well.
as of now  i have thirty more minutes to wait until i can play hogwarts!!!! already pre loaded.
the game is soo fucking good! so glad i pre-ordered it. finally a good game with zero problems  that i know of  so far
i cant wait when you live stream playing the game.
i love the way you use your hands all the time very expressive
watching the bar clip you showed... i don t know why anyone would be surprised that a game with centaurs and trolls would also have fairies in it...
no chonky kitty in this video. melonie must have got rid of the bean because it was stealing her thunder. poor bean!  bringbackthebean
happy yt birthday!!! god bless you and you re in my prayers.
my two daughters are enjoying hogwarts legacy. i decided to get the game too on pc.
just got my copy today  gonna be playing it later and having fun. the activists can kick rocks.
happy one year anniversary  i love you
just pre ordered the game. screw all the whiners. happy channel anniversary btw.
this game is insanely popular i actually reserved my copy for ps5 normal not enhanced which is now sold out and gave early access can t way to pick it up and play it on friday
wieners are weapons. very catchy.
you don t even have to wait for hogsmeade to get in-game woke  at character creation  you pick  voice one   dude voice  or  voice two   girl voice  and pick which dorm you re in   witch    wizard    and at no point is  male    female    boy    girl   mentioned. also  the npcs in the game refer to the player character as  they.  i suppose the woke crowd won t be happy with that  and that last bit would be declared  misgendering  or something.  this isn t even a complaint  just an observation. i get why they did it  even if i think it s silly  and ultimately  didn t matter to the woke lunatics one bit .meanwhile  play the game. it s fun. combat is challenging  especially if you re like me and bad at timing defense. at least i ve learned to watch out for aoe floor markers. dodge roll for the win.
just goes to show never pander to people like this.
i feel bad for girlfriend reviews. they need to toughen up and learn to enjoy their saner fans. they are a funny adorable couple but they need some armadillo skin when it comes to haters.well done mel
good year... it wasn t. but it is besides your anniversary - in this topic i salute you!this time has passed so quick... i m almost too old for this s...
just wanted to show love and congrats happy one year anniversary!
i was on a twitch channel and one person was going after them about playing it. was a small channel. i gifted them a sub so they get to see that the streamer is playing it for the next month.
weiners can be weapons killed me lol.
has it already been a year  time is flying!
everything is so black   white for those people. ironic that they make themselves out to be the tolerant ones  yet they must disown   disparage anyone who doesn t agree with them 100  on absolutely everything. the amount of cognitive dissonance they walk around with must be exhausting.
i had one of my favorite youtuber streamers release a vid today about how he won t continue streaming hogwarts legacy after the backlash he got on his stream yesterday.it was a sponsored stream from wb  he s now cancelled the future sponsored streams too.
i will say it again the graphics are beautiful!
wieners can be weapons.    ahahahahahahahahahah  i need to put that quote up somewhere!   lolthe fact that wb stated jkr had nothing to do with the game ... made me hesitant  rings of power  she-hulk. rofl     butttt   i was promised genocide!!ooops.. game is ready to play
if these terminally online professional victims were capable of taking an l then we wouldn t still be hearing about gamer gate in 2023
played the game last night  wasn t bad at all
ayo another hufflepuff let s go! can t wait to play this!
im not even a harry potter fan but i enjoy good videogames and i love this game its very fun
the rainbow mafia needs dealt with....make blood eagle great again.
i m happy this came out. even if i don t play it  i still like knowing we get them upset over something soo small. i hope she banned those people in the video. i m gonna watch some of the harry potter play through on twitch. even if i cant chat.
that trans character was a little weird. there are audio issues where they have pitch corrected some characters  probably later in production  and when  she it  talks it sounds demonic. other character have their voice pitched up and sound like chipmunks. i love the nerd voices though very stereotypical .
makes me wonder how these antirowling haters will buy anymore games cause all the gaming stores irl and on steam will be selling hogwarts legacy and if they buy anymore games they will be supporting jk rowling
what  a strange day and age this is. i never would have thought we would be talking about this 5 years ago!
joker   it would have been funny if those brats weren t so pathetic... well what the heck  i ll laugh anyway!
happy birthday anniversary melonie.
hate will ultimately consume and destroy them.
happy first channelversary  mel!
i got to the bartender and wasn t even sure if it was a trans character.  i was like  ok cool....  didn t hurt the game for me at all. i mean when you have a world of magic  anything goes. decades before this trans movement.  dungeons   dragons.  a novel call  elminster making of a mage    the goddess of magic transformed him into a women for years while he learned magic. it was only until he was able to learn the spell to turn himself back.  that was one of my favorite wizards in the lore.
i got hufflepuff too.  but i cant watch you stream it because i have to play it for myself!!  i already created my character before work and when i get home its on!!
i ll be playing this when i get home
sell your salt shares. buy copium with the money from the sellsalso  congratulations on the one year. here s to many more
it s currently sitting at 1.2m live views on twitch. absolutely amazing.
how can you find a hard copy if the game officially doesn t release until thursday or friday
so all in all  what is it that we truly learned from this failed boycott
can t wait to get my hard copy.
when they say we want them dead  they re just projecting the fact that they re not going to stop grooming until they are. wake up
unleash the caotic huffelpuff! go mel go.
i have ptsd  i m gonna need more ptsd characters in hp for the realism. i should send a hate mob to everyone because they don t normalize trauma. ptsd is perfectly healthy and everyone should have it and accept it.
from all i m hearing the game is pretty good. i only wish it had a setting more appealing to me. i m thinking super hero academy my hero academia style.
i wish people in germany would also turn like that  they still annoy every content creator playing it.
i love this take greetings from belgium. i always beeing telling everyone arround me that this is not normal bah.. but awesome take on this girl! iam a single dad with 2 girls i hope they watch your content so they grow up with a proper mindset .. thanks
oh lord  the modders are going to make that barkeep a man real quick.
at 11 00 you make the best point. we buy because the game looks great. period. none of the social and political issues come into play when we make a decision with our wallets to buy a game. and seeing non gamers try to boycott a game because of this can never work as its not in our decision making process to begin with. at least its given you good content ideas
@8 54 i zoned out for a second and all i hear is  wieners can be weapons
keep up the good work
they made a twitch streamer cry....you could hear her start crying while walking away from the pc.horrible trash people  i really wish no one paid attention to those monsters.
you were at 111k the other day now 115k! not a bad climb! you ll be at a mil and a half in a year watch
the tweet says gf reviews is progressive  but i mean they have never been overtly pushy with it if they are. they are really entertaining honestly. they have always given me the same sort of amusement that old school  hey ash  whatcha playin   used to  like long before she and anthony were actually involved in the industry. also  i can almost guarantee that prior to all this  that barkeep was female  and they just had a male voice actor record the lines. its also a safe bet that in releases outside the west  they sure as heck won t be trans. heck  from some angles  the barkeep looks a bit like a plumped up jk rowling  like perhaps that was initially meant to be her stan lee moment  and they changed it. purely speculation on my part though for the last part...
i got to this part last night and didn t even realize bartender was trans i m like oh that bad ass person for sticking up for yhe player character
tbh haters probably did more to market this game than the actual marketing campaign  several times over.
right side of history  to  are we the baddies
if you make a  weiners can be weapons  shirt  you ll be a millionaire by the end of the year.
hogwarts legacy is def the best harry potter spin off game e have in years
i would be team snake  so no step on me
the fact that you have a hufflepuff shirt on is amazing hufflepuff all day let s gooooo
this game is pretty fun but i ve noticed some glitches
game is awesome just enjoy guys its a big win
i preordered hogwarts legecy cause i am a fan of harry potter not cause of poltics i will enjoy it most likely to espicallly after all the reviews i have heard are amazing even ign ign had to give it a good review
wow  hearing about birthdays this month  makes me feel old. my birthday is this month. i don t like it. i am still going to tell people i am still 29. lol!yeah  i got the game  and i will enjoy it. 1 00 pm est. the woke cult are full of themselvs and i will laugh at them  like i have always been doing.
happy birthday on your 1 yr as streamer and youtube  mel
ign s review has a full on circled 3 paragraph section titled  the elephant in the room  to pander to their woke staff and readers. but then goes on to give it a 9
people like this should never be allowed to forget what side they piled onto  trying to sink a game that clearly had a lot of work and care go into  just because they don t like that one woman thinks there should be female-only spaces in the world.
happy youtube birthday. god bless. let them cope. we ll play the game and have fun.
we play video game to escape real life politic  but these peoples told us to boycott some video games just to pull us back into real life politic.it will be a crime to skip a great game that the devs has pour their time and effort  and that include atomic hearts too.
good for them backpeddilingtrying to spew their hatred.they need more backpedaling to the point they don t exist.thanks melonie for presenting it takecare melonie
a hufflepuff who doesn t eat carbs  pretty sus
kind of ironic that the people that want equality and freedom to love who they want  be who they want to be without judgement and just live life are the ones bulling others because those people don t agree with them. i don t know if this would be a 180 or a full circle
go boom!  happy anniversary.
congrats on the year dude
all the love my hufflepuff sister
i m so glad now that i didn t waste enough money to buy 60 vintage games on hogfart s legacy.
it s the most graphically impressive ps5 game i ve ever seen so far
there like hundreds of people streaming it because they thought no one will stream it
you also got to notice that the trans character didn t make being trans their entire identity. the character didn t bring it up or randomly shove it into a conversation or anything like that.
congrats on the one year aniversary
honestly this character still felt natural in a sense  i was half expecting pride and trans flags to be swinging on the castle walls before this game released.
happy 1 year anniversary.  god bless
whoa one year    damn  thats incredible.
girlfriend reviews are two of the most wholesome people on the internet this pisses me off
happy birthday and go hufflepuffswhatever that is. i played last night and got assigned to hufflepuffs myself.
i didnt know what woke ppl were till a friend told me.     its basically if your a barber  and a white man and a black man entered the shop at the very same time who do you serve       my answer.. mostly due to my autism was   hey you two  since you both arrived together  do rock paper scissors  i ll serve the winner first   even though my friend said that was a good answer  he told me that regardless of who i d pick  i d be called a racist. etc..  that no matter what when dealing with woke ppl there is no peaceful solutions.. x.x   that is sorta messed up..  why cant people just respect other s beliefs etc   i respect a person s choice to identify as whatever  and be attracted to whatever..  is it so wrong that i ask for them to respect my identiy and preference
i never really cared about harry potter  only seen chamber of secrets like once  but i just think it s hilarious how they tried so hard to cancel the game and now even more people are buying it and playing it and it s doing so well and now there back pedaling and attacking and harassing people  i love how people are ignoring these weirdos that don t matter lmao  i know i would be to if i was a youtuber or twitch streamer.
honestly that bartender just feels like a voiceing mistake from that clip.
as i posted yesterday the woke bullies will retreat with their tail tucked between their legs when you stand up to them and they see you aren t scared of them.
they are wholly non political they aren t progressive or conservative by any means they are just gamers
amen!!!!  all hail the gamers of the world!!!!!!   been playing mine since midnight.
girlfriend reviews is more of her watching  and listening  to her boyfriend play games and giving her perspective that way.
i want to follow the girl streaming to support her playing the game
ngl i m proud this the first time i ve bought a game myself and even better it s the first time i bought a deluxe edition bro imma enjoy this game
woot woot! happy mmgb anniversary
sadly  it was a matter of time before they started with the harassment against streamers who play this game  the salt is flowing really strong with this one.
well its kinda believable that there is some super strong magical spell to change your sex in the wizarding world.
this video made my day.
you just can t even talk to those people about it. if a reasonable person knew why jkr is under fire regarding trans issues  there would be no issue. they literally don t know what they re talking about. all they can do is parrot what someone else said. it s sad.
happy one year bday. i like your style  lady. i like your style.
the game is amazing.
it s weird that j. k. rowling is getting so much hate saying something that s the truth and that isn t even offensive. you can t just say that you re some thing when you re not  and then claim to believe in science. sorry  not sorry  it s not my responsibility to cater to your weakness.
i really wanted to play this game  sadly i was robbed this week and got no money.
girlfriendreviews is a fun take on the whole gaming review thing. they seem like a nice  suited couple. probably why these cowards are attacking them. hypocritical to want inclusivity and then bully people with differing views. although  on the bright side  that s not doing these morons any favours.
i m trans and i m gonna play the game because it looks really cooldon t really care about all that drama
as far as i am concerned if people want to play the game and stream it then they should. if people are offended by them doing it then they don t have to watch they leave a dislike and go watch something they like. streamers or anyone who posts the game should just ban the people who are being disrespectful   rude or hateful and continue doing what they want.
can t wait to play
i m enjoying hogwarts legacy it s a wonderful experience i love it idgaf if you hate me call me names they are just name like tom macdonald said in his song hogwarts legacy is my game of the year so far  btw i m a slytherin
there is even a gay witch in the game as well. you come across her when you start the first trial of merlin. and in my opinion.. i dont care bc they are not rubbing it in my face and making the main point of the interaction.. they focus on the objective and that is it..
it s beautiful!!
idk if you will ever read this but thank you. nothing against sssniperwolf but my daughter was starting to pick up her attitude. i happened upon one of your videos and i respected everything you said. then i found out you stand for biblical truth. i knew then  my daughter needed a strong female role model to watch and learn from outside of the family. we all love your videos and you have encouraged me to stand back against the woke mob. i no longer stay silent. i no longer let the word biggot affect me  since as you put it.  why should anyone care what the mentally derranged call you   i have dealt with 2 woke nazis this week one specifically about harry potter. the more that person lashed out the more i stood my ground. i finally ended with  you want me to throw out my stuff that jkr already got royalties from because you dont like her  that is rich  saying we should stand against a woman who allegedly is  for genocide  all the while you type on your smartphone that has known ties to chinese child slave labor  but that person didnt wana talk about that . after one last exchange the person realized he didnt have an argument and cursed me out one last time called me evil and blocked me . so again thank you. my family and i support you 100 .
right now these boycotters are no better perhaps even worse than jk rowling herself.
the hilarity of this is epic. now imagine if the game turns out to actually be good.... sales will just keep getting better.
100  couldn t agree more.
congratulations
dude  you look so adorable while wearing a choker...
they re so butthurt that this game is a successalso  happy youtube bday!
happy anniversary melonie. i think this is yet another example as to why you dont be a  progressive
these people never realize how much of a minority they really are. it just seems like there are a lot because of social media. just look at the sales and review scores overall  lol at the disclaimers though .
i bought another copy just to say how much i appreciate women s rights!
sodium copium from the wokies. can t wait to play it. i m on a ps4 i gotta wait but dang it s gonna be good. thank you melonie fir your content it s great take. care god bless you
i wonder if the game awards will have this game there or will bow down to the mob who don t even watch the show.
in a world with magic  keeping the deep voice doesn t make much sense.
happy 1 year anniversary!
i don t understand why woke people s happiness depends on the opinions of others.
i m still lmao that the wizard character doesn t have any reaction whatsoever to an apparent woman speaking like a man in the late 1800 s. i guess magical folk are used to strange things    not so confunded on the matter is the angle they re going for here. seems even having the character ask   what s up with your voice   is considered too offensive for some  lol!
what i recommend to the haters is thank them for the view and have a nice day
i hope i live long enough to see all these professional gamers become seniors. just going around saying  back in my day you had to be on 12 social media platforms and stream cod for 15 hours a day! war is hell  especially when a team members is super laggy.  hell just knowing kids today are going to school saying  my daddy reviews comic book video games in his bedroom and yells at microphone  during career day makes me giggle.
happy anniversary melonie
people are playing it already and loving it. it seems this game is amazing.
been playing it since last thursday  shop i ordered from delivered it really early  and it s actually great  fun and above all feels nostalgic and comfy  as well.
nobody s gonna say these things  who are you mad that dude  touch grass.
@anedime  first one is real  they already do. second is a mediocre joke. get it now
congrats
the fact that girlfriend reviews gor harassed on stream is disgusting behavior and the people who did it loses the moral high ground
we caught y all in 4k
the progs are eating eachother. do not interrupt the enemy when they are defeating themselves.
they actually made a traven npc a transgender person is hilarious actual npc moment
colorado farmers courtney and nicole mallery were arrested after making complaints about harassment on their farm.
i didn t even think girlfriend reviews was even progressive. i ve never heard them say anything remotely political. i guess it s because i only watch their youtube videos and i don t follow them on anything else. i know this isn t the first time they ve been attacked for something that they ve done or said.
congrats ms. go boom!
1 day i can play hogwarts legacy   other chosen badass games with potential   no political poison being injected into them  but first i need to re-buy  re-collect   reconstruct my ps3 collection
joined on the right day then. happy birthday to the channel
it is a fantasy world of magic.  i am just going to figure that someone put a hex on them  and i will move on  while i play.
been playing the game on early access and it s pretty fun! the game stands on it s own  regardless of woke snowflakes crying etc. the irony is that all of the complaining and whining about jk has brought even more attention to a game that is allready a game of the year contender. their tactics dont  and will never  work in a free market  which is one of the reasons that they are trying to erase it.
if you buy this game then you are afraid of us..
to the haters. cope  seeth  mald
girlfriend reviews are soft because who cares what people say  but i saw their channel and they completely look like any simple thing would make them cry
is  turf  supposed to be a hurtful label along the lines of he him and she her i m old school so i have the sticks and stones may break my bones shield to protect me from the harm words tend to inflict on the emotionally fragile.
happy b channel launch day. continued success.
who would ve thunk that making a genuinely good game would make people want to buy your product.
there s a streamer doxing site or something for anyone that streams the game apparently.
congratulations
the own they are looking for would have been if the trans person was in the girls bathroom. instead they were just a person doing a job... something jk would not give a shit about  her constant argument is to keep men out of female spaces. i do not like most of her opinions but she is 100  on the right side of this.
can you also stream the game on youtube
yup  they are... isn t it something. i seem to pick up more trans voices that say   yeah go play that game. i won t stop you. i buy it too  for a boycott to protect certain groups  it isn t really a front with a single mind is it. many of them are hp fans...
wieners are weapons
great work by the wokies. i ve got a copy of a game for a franchise i know nothing about.very happy to support rowling  even indirectly. she s just standing up for women s rights. nothing more.
looking good  melmac.
8 50 you know you are going to get requoted for this one.woman police officer   put down that weapon!men s restroom range.
if they have an option to put it into everything even categories especially  for it like every streaming service has why can t i have an option to choose not to see it  make it an npc i can opt out of.
thank you
i was shocked when there was a trans in the game. but there was also another side quest near the school where you have to save a woman from 2 dark wizards. and then soon you find out that the woman mentions she has a  wife   so i was confused on what was the trans community so angry about. surely j.k knew what was in the game  but i m sure she stands by her statement. i m not saying i support her  choice  of making her statement but it s  america  people. i m going to keep supporting j.k s work and games. get over it trans people. you re only making the game better and that s what s ironic.
it s sad that they now relied on bullying and harassment and already made a streamer s girlfriend cry  doing this to protest hogwarts legacy helps no one it only makes them a piece of shit.what happened to the good old days where people were actually happy to see a passionate game  and not get punished for it
7 26 quick  everyone clip this out of context lol
happy birthday mmgb!
pander to the ait-ieft at your own risk. they eat their own. it s funny to me that these streamers are surprised their fan base is targeting them.
love that aren t afraid to speak up.  i agree men can t menstruate.  doesn t mean i hate anyone.  i also don t believe in unicorns.  i still love horses
weiners can be weapons should be the tagline for the movement
to break down crying over mean words on a screen is a level of weakness i simply cannot fathom.. but it deserves any kind of punishment for betraying our people and pandering to the pseudo-human woke mutants.
it could be a de-transitioner because once the voice drops it doesn t go back. also no broad shoulders  most trans women have them  i m just pointing that out  also they have magic and that s the best they can do
what i find weird with the clip of the trans barkeep is that you would think that someone with true gender dysmorphia would not keep a deep voice in a world of freaking magic! i mean think about  it if you really wanted to transition  thats what trans is for short if you didnt know  from boy to girl or vice versa you would use the magic spells around you to change to that gender.......... but we all know why they have a deep voice  just saying...... it really wouldn t fit to have a trans wizard in the wizard world cause they would just be the gender they wanted to be in the first place now if this is just someone who partakes in crossdressing fine but trans nah  true trans in the wizard world would just be the gender they wanted at the start of learning magic   also because it would be instant as compared to our medical way of transitioning
ok  is every streamer of hogwarts legacy a hufflepuff  lol i mean  i m hufflepuff  too. i m just asking cus there seems to be so many. lol tonks would be proud.
why not these idiots let true fans and gamers enjoy what s fun!  jk rowling still doing a huge favor to the world by creating her beloved ip.
only they had to shoehorn in a trans character to really  stick it to the man  whatever. jkr is collecting the royalties so she still wins
once steam works for my download i will go stream this. i could careless if people talk trash to me about something this stupid. i grew up in the 2000s era with the insanely toxic halo and cod players. the stuff these people are toxic over are nothing compared to those days.
it s funny af because gr are woke so this shows how fast the fanbase they have will turn on each other if they don t agree 100  on the woke lgbtqrs agenda.
i don t think anyone said the game was gonna be crap as a product did they  it was more a thing of not supporting rowling who is against them in some way. tbh i don t follow it overly. but i m cool with their stance if it s based on what she actually said. i m just not involved so i m gonna get it.  - fuk paying that premium for 2 days in a single player game. i can wait.
the girl from girlfriend reviews is not a nice person imo she s been disrespectful to a lot of games and devs and accuse them of messed up things unfairly. also is always going to be the chat and troll sometimes. got to be able to take it. congrats on one year
i kinda also disagree with jk rowling  but the developers  who actually made the game  have nothing to do with her. we should not ruin a project in which hundreds of people have poured their soul.
i pre-ordered the deluxe edition yesterday on steam. can t wait to piss off more  victims .
i feel bad for girlfriend reviews. they are fun people and hilarious. i ve never seen them as progressive but i watch them intermittently. just sad to see such bullying.
i mma laugh when there s a mod out that either turns that character into a guy  or changes the voice to a woman s
happy birthday  i d buy ya drink if i could.
i agree. sophia narwitz is a great person
letting the haters know they re having a negative effect on you only serves to embolden them. they think if they keep it up and up the ante you ll reach that point where you ve had enough. i know it sucks for streamers but the best thing they can do is ignore them and don t cry over it. or at least don t let them see it. they get off on causing pain.
ah the trans character in the game. well  it exists... okay. it isn t like what they did with mass effect andromeda where you have one that talked her whole life story after you said  hi this character just exists... and is.
i m getting the game on friday.
wieners can be weapons. that should be a shirt. even non feminists would wear that one  it s awesome.
i m playing it right now
wonder how many will now buy the game that there s a trans side character in the game. i ve seen a lot a accounts celebrating the character and saying the right got had.
i wonder if all these people campaigning to boycott the game  realise that they ve brought more attention to jk rowlings views  and more people will of read her blog. than if they had just stayed quite.
i found out yesterday that i should be able to play 1pm est but i have a doctor s appointment at that time so will probably have to wait to 2 or 3 pm    everyone have fun. may the heterophobic science denying women haters burn in hell.
imagine actually thinking jk rowling is voldemortimagine actually believing because jk rowling has an opinion  then people must be self deleting.i have a hard time imaging being that kind of person. but apparently they exist. they ve done far more positive for this game  and increased general animosity towards the trans crowd  than any trans hater could ever hope to do. i m the type of person who doesn t care if you re trans or not. but this kind of stuff makes it much more difficult to not have negative feelings toward those type of people. reality gets to a point where there isn t a difference between the liar s  who uses others as their virtue signaling shield and those who enable the behavior in the first place. hopefully the fake victims are on their way out of society. it certainly feels that way.
i enjoy your videos
i would like to know how many people died from everyone playing hogwarts. must be in the millions based on the noise pre-release.
more proof that everyone needs to ignore the wokies online. hopefully  this game s impending success solidifies that.
they think it s supporting j.k...she got paid for the ip use  but buying the game is going to the devs  team and their families.
i m nothing of a potter fan so i m just wondering  is the game any good  is it basically just a potter rpg
congratulations  and happy birthday
here is my 2 cents  politically powered movements should have stood away from gaming and gaming community. it has no place there  it shouldn t be there  for a lot of people gaming is a escapism and cooping from that same thing that they are now pushing in. and being bullied is being invaded into your cooping mechanism. that can lead to some serious problems  life deciding problems  trans and etc. people only thing about their lives...for those saying they are streaming they should have been prepared  you are absolutely right. but everyone has a cap.
if i  remember gf reviews got mad with people that doesn t liked tlou 2 accusing them to being sexist and transphobic    now their own audience is mad because she is   supporting   a transphobic oh the irony
i do have a transgender background and i hate them  activists  so much  they have no idea what they are doing or even talking about. this goes the other way too  there are radicals and people not knowing what they talk about on both sides  like here in the comments there are plenty of people that are literally the same as those people just on the other side of the spectrum.anyway  play that game and have fun. the most ridiculous part about is that the game doesnt have anything to do with all of this  its meant for fun  nothing else.
i think it s funny that all these woke people said they re not going to stream the games  but ended up pre-ordering the game to play anyways. they re so mad that this game is doing so well. so to the woke mob in the haters thank you for the free publicity we couldn t have done it without you. if only they would have just kept their damn mouth shut for once in their life maybe nobody would have paid any attention. it wasn t until they started piping off on twitter that i heard about the game and i immediately pre-ordered it. and i don t pre-order games.
i m tired of these crazies boycotting the game  even worse bullying others into not playing. i m 9 hours in and enjoying it so i really don t care about what others think. the controversy is ridiculous. it s a game!
just use some unforgivable curses. that solves the trans bar-keep issue
i love that its always  jk rowling hurt people by being anti trans  as a defense to target people who play the game  a group that is oppressive and violent  absolute mockery
funny how one could assume i m a turf when i d need to be a feminist first. can t wait to play my ravenclaw wizard. lol.
i also notice discord censors the game from their now playing so it won t show.
im pretty glad the wokes forced me to buy this game. i like potter  not a huge fan but i m loving the game so far. my position is  the bartender has my back so i got theirs..
this game is awesome  and the whingers  pissers and moaners are coping and seething.and about that three broomsticks character  it s not in your face  so guess what  no one s rattled about that character being trans.
i didn t take that character as a trans person i ve known women who have low voices like that my aunt has a low voice like that so they can say that she s trans but i don t believe them
devs pretty much gave them a pity trans character  so they can claim their miniscule victory and move on to their next target xd
the ewoks are wishing a happy birthday to the channel! o.o o .. o o.o
about the pure insanity where they are trying to get people to boycott hogwarts legacy. is having the opposite effect it s bringing attention to hogwarts legacy but in a good way. chances are people end up watching actual gameplay footage of hogwarts legacy and seeing for them selfs how awesome the game looks. then ends up buying hogwarts legacy either for pc or console. i seen comments where people bought it just cause they know it will piss them off.when it comes to choosing games to play i can make up my own mind and besides it s my money. the day other people is buying my games is the day people can tell me what i can play.
now  this game is not for me  but  i ve not seen any normie talking about this  controversy.  almost like they never even knew about it. they just want the game. people need to touch grass more
ppl backtracking  def saw that coming  lol
i love seeing some gaming media now covering the game even tho they said they wouldn t  what a bunch of whiners
sad what s happening... so many brainwashed people in that community  asking for simpathy when they use toxic machine guns
what s hilarious about the transgender character in the game is that their name is sirona ryan and the woke mob is still pissed off because the name is  too masculine  and has the word  sir  in it. there is no pleasing the woke mob. don t kowtow to them. play the game. have fun. i know i am.
never read a single hp book  never saw a single hp movie  not even a hp fan...but the game looked fun so i bought it...and also to spite the salty folks.
mel s down with hufflepuff
girlfriend reviews is pretty apolitical. they do really like last of us 2  which is why people think they re woke. what the chat did was gross and should not be tolerated.
lmao they blocked my troll account from twitter because of the haters and congrats 1 year
just going to describe a cutscene transgender bartender gives children  butterbeers   says  my pleasure  to said children after being thanked for said  butterbeers.
wait until someone mods that character skin into a man.
that necklace is having all the fun
i m a liberal that watches a lot of conservative youtubers because i don t like all this cancel culture nonsense  either. i say live and let live  and be nice to people that have different opinions as you would in the real world. the twitter nonsense around hogwarts legacy has really brought out the worst in trans allied community. i don t agree with everything rowling says  but i think she s more harry than voldemort and she actually helps people with her money  like helping rescue women from the taliban.
the best thing any of you beautiful souls can do  is stand up to the thought police  never back down.... and have fun with life.. if you want to play a video game play it! i m loving hogwarts!... if those dudes want to wear dresses and make up good for them! this is all ridiculous.
hot take but... in the world of witchcraft and wizardy  where polyjuice potion exists  why would there even be trans people  you d think they could just make a transformation potion to completely transform someone.  anyways  long live hufflepuff!
honestly it s better to just have characters like this that are there in moderation instead of  hi i m transalina  my pronouns are she her and i was born a man! .. which is just forced garbage. this looks like an unattractive woman with a man s voice  it s kinda realistic  so it is still weird  but like that s a lot more tolerable. also... in terms of worlds with magic you d think you could at least alter your voice and go the extra mile so literally nobody would need to know unless you tell them
haters gonna hate...
why is others opinion of liking this game seemingly invalidated by the bully s that say don t play it  isn t this basically an hypocrisy on their behalf. their doing the exact thing they are bashing the game for. i m confused
make bullying kill itself
gf reviews deservers it. these woke people should be held to the same standards that they project onto others. they were just shitting on everyone over tlou hbo  from the premiere  who did not love all of the propaganda shoved in by anita-druckman into this once successful ip.
the reason they lost is because the cultists are such a small number that it s pitiful! haha
best game of the year  it s february
that s not the only thing you can actually create and play a transmale or a trans female character  so basically the developers slap the lgbt community in the face and was like what the hell are you doing we re supporting you all. so now what s really funny is that they  the haters  all look like ignorant backstabbing religious zealots throwing a tantrum over absolutely nothing. i have a video on my gaming channel witch shows you how to do this in depth and it s super easy.
it s almost 2am where i am for when the game starts.stayed up just to put the middle finger to these feeble minded cowards.
i wouldn t have even known that person was trans if it weren t for you saying they were. i don t mind like trans characters and stuff as long as they are people first and trans second. but almost as upsetting for me is that this is also just another erasure of history. representation should only go so far. and i get it  this is a fictional game and all that  so not going on a  witch hunt   pun intended   but we see this in a lot of other series and shows and stuff. hamilton with its all poc cast is an excellent example.
ignore the haters. this game is great. just ignore their idiocy. they are irrelevant. never let the woke control what you do or how you think and never apologize for doing nothing wrong. this shite is ridiculous.
i resent being called a terf because i m not a feminist.
i suggest to anybody who stream hogwart legacy to also start a fund raising for transpeople who strive in these time of need.
please put your game on youtube.  i am a hufflepuff and i m finding it difficult.
you can make yourself transgender  all the npcs use. they then pronounce when referring to you  there s the transgender three broomsticks owner  i ve already run into a lesbian old woman. if this game isn t inclusive enough for the woke mob then nothing is and developers should stop trying to satisfy them
i never cared much for the harry potter movies. but this game looks super cool and i definitely plan on playing it. the trans character seems fine and it s shoehorned in which is how it should be! but i ve realized more and more that now the trans movement is built on misogyny
i never understand in these magic settings where they clearly have transformation magic but the trans characters never fully transform.
so glad i don t listen to extremists  game is freaking awesome.
got rid of the hoodie huh  great video
a bit too much woke stuff in the game  i wouldn t say it s fantastic  but the game is good enough. maybe a 4 because of the woke stuff and quite a few bugs.
conservatives right-wingers absolutely infight. happens all the time. the quarterpounder and beanie man are squabbling as we speak.
girlfriendreviews now seeing what their side of the politics are willing to do to their own.. anyone and everyone is a target when it comes to the woke cultist. straight up bullies.
i know you can make a trans character and now i know of this bartender  what else is there
as far as girlfriend reviews - you help build this world where you get bullied. i don t have any sympathy for them. i love their reviews  but they obviously cater and bow to the woke people.
what if somebody kept giving u 100  donations just to tell u what games u can play.100  donations on how u should act.thats what they did to etika
honestly i don t like that in a world of magic where you can turn yourself into an immortal god that you can t do such a thing as a sex change  much less voice changing and much much less morphing your face. trans people just wouldn t exist in such a world and including such a person is kinda wokey  unless she s some sort of celebrity.
my 8 year old daughter is starting our stream when she gets home in a few hours from school. i got about 2 hours into the game and it seems appropriate for her.
when you have a ps4 and have to wait until april
why would they have a trans chracter in game when you can  dickus yeetus  and become whatever you want  that s like a very shtty wizard
happy birthday melonie.
the irony about the hate-mob trying to virtue signal about the  token trans representation  like you say  the scene is subtle and the features of the person is androgynous enough without the stereotyping that the person covers and represents  intersex  androgyny  dual-passing version  incl. femboy approximations and transwoman approximations   klinefelter s and klinefelter s mosaic and the alternative version affecting biological women  bioinflecting women who have  manly voices  due to random variations within evolutionary mechanisms  so kinda  intersex  or  woman like men  so to speak ... etc  etc. all represented in just one in-game character.i actually think that s a win  and besides  if a  magic spell  can cause ronnie  or was it another student in the hp universe   to  identify as a rat  physically speaking  then a  spell  that causes or allows gender-bending definitely doesn t sound out of place at all.
tbh  the trans character they added to the game to counter backlash of jk rowling s pov pisses me off.  real trans do what they can to sound fem if they re mtf  but that char is straight up dude.not to mention jk rowling is raising her voice to protect women in prison and children with underdeveloped brains to prevent them from making life altering threatening decisions.also  gamers don t gaf about politics.  we care about games.  and hogwarts legacy clearly looks great.
these mobs are even attacking twitch streamers for streaming the game   girlfriend reviews mart and shelby has been recently dissed on twitch by these idiots .
bullying people for playing a video game defeats the purpose of their boycott. they re supposedly fighting for trans rights but don t care to attack other people   like that literally makes no sense. i m playing the game because i like the world
weiners can be weapons
they re right though. the boycott failed  but the game still pushes  the message . a few years ago we would be saying  why did they put a guy pretending to be a woman in my wizard game  . now we re celebrating the fact that a bunch of normies love harry potter because it means the far-left lost. just because they lost doesn t mean we ve won
oh no  they added an old woman who sounds like a bloke... how ever will i make it to the next quest !  i guess i ll just do the impossible and carry the f on with my day
are you going to stream the game
check out the guardian review by keza macdonald. i m shocked he even played it to review it  although i m sure he actually didn t.
i m buying deluxe on friday
i have little sympathy for gfr. they chose to wrestle with pigs and are now crying about the mud.
i m buying 20 copies of deluxe edition.
the game is pretty good...the amount of woke is irritating  but not overwhelming.wouldn t let a kid play it  but a rational adult can overlook it.
in fact a better character would be someone who is trans and uses magic to change their appearance but sometimes in times of duress they morph back or you can kinda peer into the veil of such a tormented being. i just hope they modelled characters after real people which would explain that character better instead of just randomly including them cuz muh representation
happy anniversary.
i don t mind they include trans people in game and all that. it s in the game naturally and didn t make a huge deal of it which is great. i like it being normalized in the world. i just don t want to be de-humanized over me wanting to play a game.
putting a trans character in a game where a person can turn into a cat at will is not weird. i would think they would do a better job of passing though.
dear wokerati cope. seethe. mald. sneed.
great day just enjoying hogwarts legacy suddenly getting attacked by an entire discord server when they notice im playing it lol
teosgame a youtuber was literally creating an lgbtq charity cos ppl was being so toxic to him and trying to cancel him cos he played and stream the game lmao
nothing against anyone else but the previews were all devoid of white people. the problem i have with harry potter is that jk rowling was one of the biggest  woke  idiots out there  pandering to the mob with her hermione was always black  she was described as white on the books  and dumbledore was always gay  another thing she had to retcon because it simply wasn t true  so although i hate the cancel mob she was a bit part of them until she was targeted  i find it hard to defend her!
switcharoo  melonie is our favorite boomer.
did u see the live that keen star did talking about jk rowling and he had a lot of lgbtq and trans people in the twitter live he did it was idk i got no words about it
happy tuesday melonie mac!welcome to mario kart melonie mac from yesterday! melonie please comeback to mario kart again!
ill sub once this starts being about the game and stops being about the  woke mob trash content for now
i bought the deluxe edition yesterday but i can t play because i m in chlaas
i played for a few hours last and it s extremely immersive  until you meet the teams character. why would there be a transgender in the 1800 s  it makes no sense and takes you out of it. otherwise  it s nearly flawless.
happy yt birthday mm!!!!!!!! 1 06
it is so crazy. they think we mind that trans people get representation. that s not a problem at all. we are ok with trans characters. what we hate is the absurd and often socially violent way these radicals go about forcing the message down our throats.  they see a trans person in this game and think it s gonna drive us mad with anger or something. like its some vast victory for their cause  even after the boycott failed. its cool. i think it s neat personally  but i still don t agree with radical activist trans ideology  or rat s. they can tag us.. why not tag them with some vaugly insulting acronym
lol. i kind of low-key want trooniez to minecraft themselves.
joke s on them  i play wow we already got a trans character voice actor!  so my ears are used to the voice  i have been trained!
anybody that seriously tries to force others to boycott this needs a reality check  so i hope this is just one spark that leads to people collectively telling them to take a hike.rowling certainly isn t even  transphobic  just for acknowledging that biology is real and females are different than males and it makes sense in some scenarios to separate the sexes.but if this is their bar  they need to boycott basically every large company in existence. every single company you patronize has some members or employees that disagree with you and you need to learn to pick your battles and get over it or create support alternatives. you re not winning people over by telling them they re evil for liking something.if the message or point of the franchise was mocking trans people for example  then that would be valid maybe. similar to the chick-fil-a drama years ago  like there are probably thousands of gay employees and you re not doing anything by hating on the whole company cause one guy at the top disagrees with you on certain issues.this goes for left   right  pick your battles  create alternatives or support someone you like better. don t try to cancel or hurt people because they don t care as much as you.
well looks like i won t be playing it then. thanks for saving my money and time
@klarapetrijevcanin  that s a shame  but i get it
if the woke try to cancel something i ll end up watching it anyway just to annoy them
imagine subscribing so hard to an ideology that everything you do and everything everyone else does has to follow along with your narrative. i wish elon had bought twitter and just shut it down tbh.
the trailer looked woke though  are you limited to playing as an asian or black wizard or did the woke pr department who made the trailer just do that for diversity  can you create your own character
this little wokie went to market. this little wokie stayed home. this little wokie had plant based  roast beef . this little wokie had none   cause they spent all their money on weed.  this little wokie found out how extremely well hogwart s legacy did and cried reeeeeeee! all the way home.
still far more excited for legend of zelda tears of the kingdom and hollow knight silksong. just not a huge potter fan and dear god the commies manipulated yall to buy it thrice a head.
2 10 this character looks like brittney venti
is this really a game though  i was told the best  games  are walking forward  press x  and watch 35 minute cut scene.
people seem to forget the game s about brii ish ppl. that s much more of a crime and transgression than any transes or something wizards.
dead ass! i wouldn t be surprised if they took a random female character in the game and redid the voice from female to male just to make some ppl shut the hell up haha
the rainbow orcs are massing for attack!
you won me as a subscriber
games great. i got banned for a week on a certain gaming web forum just for adding it my list of games i was going to buy in feb. like wtf  lol these people live such sad lives.
wow a year. i must have subbed a coulple weeks in because ive almost watched a year
hufflepuff unite!!!!!!! 3 43
congratz!
activists likes to bark a lot but they cannot bite at all.
but don t you know   they totally won  cuz there s apparently some inconsequential trans character shoehorned in!  yaz slay take that chuds.  pfff hahaha.      keep it up melonie mac!
great vid! gg
i wonder why the company never said anything about the tr@nsgender character   perhaps they knew they would lose money if they did  because they thought the people who wanted would cancel  and knew the boycotters started such a smear campaign and couldn t afford to buy it  perhaps.  and the people who did want to play it  this doesn t bother us anyway. we backed the game but they didn t back us. we see you.
when everyone s rating it 9 10 mabey it s time to go a little terf.
you can create a character of all skin tones  white included.
@lordnazar6382 cool
they have a trans character in the game but since it s magic it s not trans it s just a pollyjuice potion hahaha
preach!
happy birthday melonie
happy youtube anniversary.
its sold out at best buy and gamestop in canada. i hope this sends a message to corporations and executives that not caving to the woke mob will lead to success. just look at the based comments section of the ign review.
i literally bought the game cos i wanna prove those ppl wrong f that people
isn t this gotcha moment for themselves they re the ones who said the game is transphobic
damn a year already  i subbed like 4 or 5 months ago
platforms like tiktok has really destroyed this generation my sister is very woke and i have opinions that aren t bad i even said the word female before and she said that would is offensive
lols these people. also  happy anniversary.
how i love how these wokie mob people are so truly trying to be right but actually they are totally wrong bout this new hogwarts video game and they are trying to tear us video gamers down but really they can not really do that bc we as gamers are totally right and correct bout this video game and we as gamers can prove them right bout this video game  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to tell you that and make a comment about this video for today  ok melonie. anyway also i just want to tell you that you are looking great   gorgeous in this video for today   i am sorry that i missed your game night last night with geeks and gamers as y all were playing mario kart video game last night. anyway hope y all had fun with the game last night. anyway i just want to tell you that and i just want to tell you that to have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. god bless you and your hard work that you do for your fans like me and everyone else who is following you on your boom channel and on twitter. god bless you melonie. anyway have a great day melonie.
one person was supposed to do an article of 20 jkr transphobic quotes  there weren t any lmao
happy 1 year birthday
this game looks cool but i m excited for zelda
is that the barkeep from shrek 2
100  facts
if you want to be gay or trans or queer or whatever  why should it matter to us  when you start screaming it and telling everybody that they have to support you being that then it sounds more like that you re looking for peoples approval first.  oh no  we re not trying to get people s approval  it sounds like you are by saying that if we don t agree with you then we re haters  fun fact  you can love someone and not agree with them
hi melonie from jack thompson florida lawyer 2000s going after gta to sjws going after hogwarts legacy clown world congrats on the channel thoughts
bless your heart.
it woke on woke crime so basically let them go at it as hard as they like
i mean there s a lot of conservative youtubers i am subscribed to that i don t agree with them 100  of the time but it doesn t mean i don t love them or their channel any less
we need the word hetero in from of the gendersign on public toilet doors. thank you.
have they ever won let s be honest
my weiner is totally a weapon. it shoots and i can poke out eyes. xd
huffle puffers unite
didn t gfreviews gave abbinator of us 10 10 and then smack talked those who didn t like it or something like that. serves her right tbh. live by the woke  die by the woke
gotta keep shutting down the crazies or they they ll only get stronger. last few years of lunacy needs to go away!
they are such babys f them lol the games amazing im playing it early an its a great game an i dont even like harry potter that much lmao but i made sure to buy it anyway and im glad i did i love this game
i was going to play hl irregardless. but normally i never do a pre-order on anything. but this time i pre-ordered  the deluxe edition as a big middle finger to these goose stepping leftists. they can live thier lives how they wish but they will not dictate to me how i will live mine!
i don t know how to correctly say in english but  we say that as  drinking your own spit
that trans npc looks and sounds just like my non-transgender aunt.
hufflepuff gang!!!!!! lets go lol
most of these woke warriors already preordered it.
they sound just like the red guard from mao s china during their great leap forward of the 60 s
why didnt they just kick ban people who were being toxic  seems like a simple solution.
i m so glad the they s who shall not be named are malding
happy channel birthday go boom
happy channel birthday
happy birthday
hi melonie! you say go boom. so i go boom!
congratulation in anniversary
happi birthday mel  or mel s channel
okay the whole point of legacy is new up-and-coming people in harry potter world i mean think about it the last two movies what did they do gave up their powers so a new generation can take over but i guess heaters don t like it take the l
hogwarts deluxe edition just dropped and btw it s my birthday.what did she mean by this
guarantee majority of those people talking dwon on this game and trying to boycott it are playing it off stream
happy channel birthday!
i m kinda disappointed in the game for not including a kid friendly drag show
heard about this from a co worker
happy channel birthday
olha  ela faz o l
hi  just found you. subbed  3 lol
happy birthday
happy boom-day!
woke eating the woke  good.
it s called block the harassers  if you cry then stop streaming.if you cry get off the internet.yes is stupid and immature who harass but that s why there is a block button on twitch.or turn off the chat.
congratulations
wangus snippus heres your butter beer
happy birthday!
oh same day as my birthday!! happy birthday to your channel  d
ever notice woman whom aren t  woke  are always more beautiful than the ones who are
i dont see a good reason why people hate this game because there were no problem when i was a kid.
they found a way to make the trans characters name an insult. the cope is hilarious  they are creating bullying material themselves
happy go boom day !
weiners are a weapon my mind https   www.youtube.com watch v lcfhlgnjqs8
happy boomday!
activision-blizzard was home to some truly shitty people. does that make those who like diablo call of duty bad people  hell no. the people who think hogwarts legacy is causing harm want it to be true  because then they can get their pitchforks and start some fights. the people who just want to enjoy a video game are not bothering anyone.
happy channel b day!
loading physical deluxe edition up on ps5 in advance of work ending here shortly.  as far as i m concerned the wee fairies that have been crying can just p!   off then  because i have gryphons to fly!
jk rowling essential said  the sky is blue . it wasn t even against trans people i don t understand.
they really think it bothers us because there is a trans character  there is also elves and trolls lol
happy youtube birthday!
hopefully girlfriend reviews will learn a valuable lesson about the left
game of the decade
what i find funny about this is that there s a trans character in the game. so whose side are they on
happy youtube birthday.
happy birthaversary
i used to watch gfr  enjoyed it. then they defended tlou 2 and i was like   okay that was fun while that lasted.  and dipped out. they were chasing  the woke cult  s approval even if they didnt realize it. so i aint surprised this happened too them. sorry it happened. but not surprised.
i m boycotting boycotts in  23!!!
8 54  wcbw    weiner s  can  be  weapons!  by melonie mac    and for tomorrow s show aad   assholes are destructive!
all they did was give a female character a man s voice and then called it trans. how silly. i thought the main idea was to not be able to tell. you shouldn t know without them explaining it and why would they explain it  i though the whole idea of being transitioning is to become a different gender... not make a whole new  gender
imagine dissing the woke
i dont know much about you but daaayuum. emphasis on the yuum.
as a muggle  im not feeling represented at  hogwarts. boycott!
team hufflepuff yeow!
i havent got the game  p not because of hate its just not my personal cup of tea    i watched the harry potter movies and enjoyed them
science is science
insane...
i feel like they threw that character in last minute  that man clearly sounds like a man dressed as a girl  right now the woke mob is trying to cope and trying to say they weren t gonna let them win by not buying the game
wooo happy channel bday thats a thing right
its unreal engine and single player  we can mod it to our liking.
billion dollars vs nobody s. who wins  you decide.
happy channel birthday
let them eat each other.
just subbed  i make animated anti-woke cartoons
can t we just all go back to playing donkey kong...
commenting to feed the algorithm
imagine once release hogward legacy have lgbt scene wonder how the youtuber reaction is
happy youtube birthday!
it s hilarious to see the twitter babies trying to shame you over there.
u for real come off as a shuffle puff lol.
personaly i thouth about buying it just to piss people off... but i already got like 3 games on my wishlist when they come out soon
shouldn t i be able to choose what i want to buy without being criticized  is there such thing as a purchase that would be considered offensive
but they full that s all we took the l the developers backtracked pentameter the psychotic transgender woke left after they got our money and we we fell for it hook line   sinker
no sympathy  at all .  they laid down with snakes  now they re getting bit.  all is right in the world.
they eat their own

hear hear
never got the  progressive  vibes from girlfriendreviews  at least from what i ve seen on their yt channel.
the game is not even fully released yet and people pretend it s a success.
happy online birthday.
your 1rst year with this channel and my birthday
do you know your father  i m guessing no.....call it an educated guess
happy birthday
congrax
brum go brrr
you are a bad person for playing a game you are spreading hate!  so let me actually spread hate and literally bully you that makes sense. the hypocrisy  these people just want attention and to play victim its sad.
actually reminds me of the ugly stepsister in shrek
you get a like for your youtube birthday
weren t there actual sex-change potions or magic in harry pooter   if so  there s no reason for anyone in the wizarding world to be what we would consider  trans .
cry babies man. i love when idiots are wrong.   good video congrats on the year
happy youtube birthday.
i thought the audio on my game was messed up when the trans started talking
you are smart
happy youtube birthday
hogwarts legacy not for me. melonie have a ball streaming   playing the game. holla go boom.
buying 2 copies just to hurt the sentiments of these wokes. crazy people.
lol weiners can be weapons
to me personally it just sounds like somebody dubbed over the original va trans or not it just does not fit the character whatsoever it s very uncanny
@meloniemacgoboom they act like the trans character is a win.....this character reminds me of shrek s the ugly step sister
the trans npc is a slap to the face of jk rowling how disappointing
the demographics of the game do not match the population of 1800s britain.
year 1
blizzard sued multiple times for sa  but you don t see these virtue signaling dummies  actually boycott the games they make. the boycott lasts for like 3 hours tops.  i bet they still eat at chic-fil-a but tell people they don t.
happy bd
nice tattoo
the woke cult has failed
why did they put some one who is incapable of controlling their own mind into the wizarding world  where to cast in the first place you have to have a certian modicum of self control   discipline  but to mute cast requires  basically  absolute control over ones mind  even more so  why does he still sound like a man while kind of looking like a woman when magic exists and full body transfigurations are a thing this is full on grooming to my perception  another attempt to normalize something that is not natural in any way and is by it s nature a learned  chosen ideological path.
copium must flo
to be fair... from what i see - im not a fan  dsnt look that great! tho that shouldnt be a reason for me to hate someone who enjoys the game! its just not my type of game...
cancel culture have been gaslighting  a game they hate but turns out they should love because the game has a trans person in it lmao

bruh these haters better play the game. we are actually playing trans in this game ..if anyone got it wrong it was us...we are being called they in the game. we can t pick male or female  not even he or she ... warner bros caved ....
boom
it s a very low voice on that  trans  character. that far along in the transition and the voice would definitely be higher. last minute addition
team hufflepuff all the way!!
angry joe are playing it too.. .and he is one of the biggest leftys here. so yeah...
i never even thought girlfriend reviews was progressive at all... if they turned that way...well... reap what you sow i guess
birthday sub!
cannon now  !  says who  not that i mind the inclusion. but just because it s in a game does that mean it s actually cannon  does the word even mean anything anymore
imagine of these people were  capable for even a single second of considering that the people telling then to piss off were not i  fact trans haters but people who were are tired of being spoken down to and tired of being told what to do  or else  .has a single one of them denounced the list they made of streamers playing it  their organised bullying  oh no of course not. the game is anti-trans because jk rowling doesnt agree with the most extreme beliefs of lunatic activists who just shift the goal posts even further every other week anyway. jk  i won t descend into madness with youactivists  heretic!!!!
i ll laugh my ass off when they mod the perverts voice out and replace it with an actual woman s.
trans people in hogwarts doesn t even make sense. they can just change their gender with magic.
the flip flopping is more than a fish on life support. just shut up and enjoy video games.
why so much hairspray
that just looks like a girl character with a male voice  doesn t look trans
gott deluxe version on steam and standard version on epic  hopefully a woke person will read this and have a mental breakdown
in my opinion  if you can t tell  then go to the bathroom.. you want  but if you clearly are a man in a wig  go to the men s room
def my second choice.
yup  and you know lots of boys would use them to get into the girls locker rooms. they d probably have to ban the spells.
that trans character in hogwarts legacy is so cringe. if you are a wizard and you want to be a woman you would probably do some magic to also modulate your voice. it feels like that wouldn t be uncommon in the wizarding world. cyberpunk 2077 did a much better job with their trans character  claire  which is one of my favorite characters in that game.
that trans character is hilarious. literally  it s a woman but they added a man s voice and some people are satisfied now  progressive!
that crossdresser looks like a mannish older woman. you would never know if he had a female voice actor. they exist.  not everyone is pretty as a picture.
mmh. boycotts are fine in my book. restricting other people is obstruction and should not be tolerated. bullying is always a bad thing.
lawd almighty in heaven  may your grace and holiness smite out the wickedness and foulness from these people  for their souls have surely been corrupted by satan himself  causing them to lash out at the poor and innocent. can i get an amen from everybody in the replies
wait what is a mental illness
it s kind of weird having a trans person in the game ngl. it makes no sense in the wizzarding world if you ask me but other than confusing me the first time i ll go and get a butter beer  it s okay i guess to have them portrayed in the game... maybe we get a mod that changes the voice since it s really irritating
pffffthahahaha  i m that s not a trans character  that s just a female character model with a man voice actor  funniest shit i ve seen all day!
who was trans in that clip  if you had not pointed it out who would have known
will the lgbtmnop community please boycott my company  i need the extra business and it seems like a great marketing campaign
if they are progressive and decided to play the game..i mean they knew what they signed up for.  i don t feel bad for them if that is the case  though if the girlfriend cried  that isn t cool.  crybullies suck ass.
the game is plenty woke. wb games used the lunatics to sucker lots of good people into paying for their next 10 woke projects....meanwhile the harry potter game has its share of radical leftist tropes to plant in kids. they won on both sides.....because we are so worried about  pwning the libs  we get duped by a giant mousetrap with a giant piece of cheese on it  like pea brains.by the end  the game will be a woke prize  and we will have all paid them for it. we need to be more thoughtful and less worried about twitter spats.this is why we lose.
technically this person is not trans.it s just a person who looks female and has a deep voice.maby she just smokes a lot. something munch safer than pills and surgery.
unsurprisingly  the male voice coming from that bartender is jarring and looks out of sync.  i wish they would just stop inserting this stuff into literally everything.  it s fine here and there  particularly when there is an actual narrative purpose to it  but the forced insertion feels forced and detracts from the medium.  hopefully  the overall game outshines this crap.
people that don t get physical copies are the problem with gaming preservation when the woke weirdos complain and game s we love are removed from the internet we lose them for ever i ll never switch to anti consumer downloading it s just so they can delete those games put them out called remastered and steal money from people over and over again it should be ilegal if they get rid of physical copies i will just quit buying all together android riped me off on several downloads my saying your game is no longer compatible and call if duty zombies coast me  5 to download and it won t let me play or refund my money on my phone if you stand up against digital download future i will always watch and like every video on this channel
good.. they don t represent all of us  lgbt  all s they are doing is harming our community. it s a video game. if you don t want to play it  don t  if you do  please do. im gonna play it! i just think individuals should decide how far they should draw the line. but trying to brute force opinions is just not the right way.
y u got so many tattoos girl  u already cute. don t need that extra ink.
you sound like you live in michigan
i m ok with trans characters in media as long as the product isn t outright saying that people can transition into the opposite sex.
perspective.
i ve drank in many pubs  met many barmaids  and some of them do look like blokes! their voices are also pure gravel.
i don t even get it  why are you even watching this  so the people who demand acceptance the most won t accept anyone who is different from them  so why should any of us accept them when if you don t agree they won t accept you
purple tinker is not a true bronie they just wanted to capatolize on the phenomena of bronies  since i watched the documentary   and they should never be part of the cancel culture drgama sounds like a dude.d
cannibals
the time to never care about what the lgbt people care or think about is long past due
6 20 why that woman sound like a guy
crazy we live in a world where harassment is so easily done on platforms their home address is known id due twitch for allowing this
the hate never had anything to do with the quality of the game. people on reddit were trying to get people to protest it because of  the homophobic and transphobic author.
the hate isnt mainly on twitter anymoreits hounding in the discord the whole server is a constant war
i m a christian.  i follow jesus. but in all his teachings  we are told to love everyone as he did but hate the sin people do.so  in other words  hate the game  not the player  so to speak.so a lot of people get wrong that we christians hate everyone or jesus says he hates everyone. nope  we love everyone. we just don t like ur sin. and yes  we all sin  but that s why he had to dye for us. to cover our sin when we dye as long as we believe in his dye for us. but a lot of people will not agree with me  and that s fine. you can disagree . you have freedom  which i support  and that s where the problem is within the world. other people don t want you to have that freedom. i am sorry that this is the way it is . i wish everyone could come together  but instead  we all fight each other like we are at war with one another. a strong country is a country together family. that s the only way.
love capitalism
aw yes  the intolerance of the  inclusive  woke types. diversity in everything but thought  classic.
i dont mind the trans character being there  but it s a bit strange that there would be a trans person in the 1800 s just serving drinks and shit.
they even went after cute japanese vtubers.  shows what trans is really about  shame.
game isn t canon lol
alphabet cultists.
i m going to buy this just to spite the woke. might as well since they ruined the remake of resident evil 4 with their wokeness and censorship
this game just feels very goofy. the acting feels hammy and poor if not for the political discourse it would be a mid 7.
ppl complainign about a game    alot of bad things in life are very bad   we geting tyranized and ppl dying on un necesary wars   but this losers blaming a gamem   whata losers lol
yeah i m not a fan of discord cos of that. had to use it for work. quit that. never again!
who are you
this is for the woke do not come crying bc most hispanic love to have big healthy hard worker family  it can happen a takeover of this ungrateful country by massive hispanic number  bc most going to have a big healthy hard   family
you wanna know why the boycott didn t work  coz a lot of those folks calling for it aren t even gamers - they are activists. they weren t the target demographic. how can you boycott something you wouldn t have bought in the first place anyway  so  no lost sales there. true gamers don t want political crap polluting the hobby. for the people saying that big companies with wide reach should have a responsibility to push or support political ideas - no. that s a job for your elected officials. games are meant to entertain - they shouldn t serve as a platform for for ideology. get out of our space wokies!sincerely gamers
that s not a woman it s a man baby
if soynee would have made the game they would have had every character in it be a transformer and men would have been evil and stupid like in all three resent disappointing woke joke garbage
that s the trans character we ve been hearing about  it s literally a woman with a man s voice. zero effort. hilarious.
yoooo
is the bartender supposed to be trans  it honestly sounds like it s a pitch shifted voice recording
there is no such thing as trans  . dna is key cant change it   its all a mental thing  . and the game is amazing . its not ok to attack people at all just for playing a game  .
i didnt keep up with this drama  why are the woke nerds going mad over this game

isnt this game set in th 1800s  what did they call a transgender in the 1800s
the bar tender is just a woman with a lower voice....so what....i ve heard women with lower voices it doesn t meat she is trans....and she doesn t have an adams apple so again woman  not man....lol
why does that female bartender have a male voice   don t the vast majority of trans people strive to sound like the gender they re presenting   shouldn t she be attempting a female voice
i agree with everything you said except i dont know why you think transgender characters shouldnt be in a game for children  thats weird imo. trans people have been around forever  why shouldnt they be in video games for children
mobbing is not ok   for everybody. and yes   that includes trans people.all haters should be ashamed of themself .  how inclusive do you want it  hogwards in not a transphobic game.
elderscrolls for babies. i know its only new and theres initial learning curve. but. this seems like babies game zero threat just inane simple sidequests gathering and talking talking crap with endless gobby children and diversities. modern zoomers game zero actual substance just imagery and talk maybe it gets alittle better but im not feeling it. game for dummies nobody can lose just keep harvesting shit an lvling up.
that s just a female character voiced by a man not altering his voice. call that trans if you want but i know women who look and sound like that. calling that a man could be sexist against biological women.
you know i felt bad until i learned they were progressive now it s funny. you empower those types of people all the while dismissing everyone who says they are not good people. then you act confused. sorry but im gonna go grab so popcorn . that compassion i m supposed to have is being shown by me choosing to not help them by not going out of my way to email your bosses and friends. all i m doing is watching and laughing. just to be clear this is directed only towards progressive those who voted for biden.
nope. you lost me at  it s a mental illness  and  kids are being groomed into it . and  we don t want it glorified . they re just asking for acceptance and not to be singled out. divergence isn t  mental illmess . they are part of society  so just let them be. sadly  you re not as independent of thought or progressive as you like to believe. educate yourself.
it looks like something from little britain.  i m a lady  don t ya know. if i went through indescribable hell to transition  i d be pissed that is my representation.
the bartender is voiced by a trans.the lip syncing and voice delivery is so off that it wouldn t surprise me if the character was altered to just appeal to the left...not a great choice.
because jk rowling stands up for womens rights.
trans rights are human rights.
many streamers had a hand in creating this monster. no sympathy. this type of bullying happens to conservative voices everyday. suck up and stop crying i say.
seeing the transgender innkeeper...i couldn t care less. good for her...idc  game focuses on magic and that s the best
a trash character or a man in drag  i mean trans... same thing.
sounds to me that all parties involved are mentally immature and need to be kept off the internet  no matter how you want to spin it.....its for children and all the politics should be kept out!
