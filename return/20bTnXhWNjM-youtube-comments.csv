I love the verses you share! living by the Bible  living the way God designed us to  is such an act of rebellion these days its insane

I just randomly found you out of nowhere  and I think Im a fan.  I agree with the complete bs that today s gaming media and much production is going.  its hardly anything new  but it just keeps getting worse.  Im more a fan of the final fantasy shining force langrisser scene than perfect dark or halo  but we see the same kind of thing there.  the big publishers are pushing themselves down the drain  and indie devs are making a comeback.also  I was not expecting a  verse of the day  at the end of each video  but bless you my sister for your faith!

never apologise for your faith or for sharing it. I love the Bible verses and you have encouraged me to share more

found your channel recently and I loving it it nice to see there s a Christian on youtube thats not  just a preacher or a Bible study. Im glad I found your channel.

I really appreciate your Bible segments. whatever it is you do makes it connect with me a lot more than sitting in a pew for how ever many hours and going to sunday school ever could.

the Bible verses is probably the thing I love most about you. keep up the good work. to paraphrase a famous quote  someone with no enemies is someone who s never stood up for anything in their life.

in my opinion  perfect dark was better than goldeneye. I didn t like perfect dark zero  I have very low expectations for this reboot. the Bible says be strong  so eat meat.

I haven't seen your channel until just a few days ago and its really nice to see someone talking about video games thats also not an idiot. it seems like every game channel is woke and anti-male. also I like that you do verses because its nice to see someone actually being positive. a positive Christian gamer girl not being woke is unheard of these days. highest of respect to you.

19...35? ok  you really surprised me when you pulled that up. lol and I agree 100  on what you said there. never feel like you have to  apologize  or be ashamed when speaking about Christ! I just found your channel via this video  joanna's such a freakin legend! . you have another subscriber.

melonie  there's nothing wrong being Christian its just people who cant put differences aside
