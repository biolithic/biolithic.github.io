asking for help is one of the hardest things we can do. it doesn t mean you weak or can t cope  it just means you need a shoulder to keep you going. you got this melonie  you re a champ x
what bothers me is that one person can break somebody s spirit and that s not cool. the fact that she dedicates her time in her content and to see her cry causing her to stop everything is making me go boom! stay strong  we are here  3
never apologise for being emotional when being put under pressure like this. you must be exhausted going through what you are going through right now. you deserve all the support you get and the community you have built are with you. take care!
we dont support you out of pity but rather out of love. you don t have to earn love to receive love. dont resist it but rather just receive it. we love you because of who you are. you bring so much joy and inspiration to so many people. now it is our turn to bring you some inspiration. please feel free to take the rest of the week off. we will all be here when you are ready to come back. god bless!
and saying thank you goes a long way. don t apologize or justify why you don t deserve or do. when someone gives you something  say thank you and keep it pushin! sometimes when you have a hard time accepting people s generosity  it can be insulting to the giver so don t be ashamed to accept the help and you re gonna be fine!
my urge to give melanie a comforting hug is overwhelming right now
it s crazy how generous jeremy s fans are.  every time he brings something to light  they always step up.
asking for help is 1 of the hardest things we can do. proud of you melonie. it takes strength to ask for help. and i know you got this. we all have your back
try not to worry  you got a lot of us in your corner!   much love and positivity.
i know you re not gonna see this mel  and you probably heard this about 100 times already  but you have the love and support of everyone here in the community. even though you re going through this entire horrifying situation  you re managing to stay strong  and that in itself is very admirable and inspiring. thank you for the countless hours of entertainment you have provided. we appreciate you!
you have great support  we re here for you melonie.
hi  melonie. i m never going to tell you what to do. go where your prayers and god lead you. i ve deleted plenty of posts and videos that just didn t feel right afterwards. but this is my advice from a stranger  don t delete this video. it s not a matter of composure or maintaining a cultivated  cheery persona for youtube. your fans love melonie the human being  with all of her fears  weaknesses  vulnerabilities  hopes  and even despairs. today  you showed us pure truth in your tears and fears. and you even showed us your strength  wit  and resolve  just by wearing a strawberry shortcake shirt that some vile person once found so offensive. i ve seen people mocking you online and even supporting your stalker  because they say you made it all up. for any decent person with a heart that seeks the truth  this video is the only proof they will ever need. you don t owe us anything  ever. but you chose to let us into this troubling time in your life  so that we can help carry your pain in our own prayers and actions. i m glad i got to know the real melonie a little better today. i am praying for you to be strong and safe and to never cow to fear  hate  and lies. that s not the spirit you ve been given. god go with you.
i didn t do anything to deserve it.  you didn t deserve a stalker. you do deserve the support. you don t know how many people whose day you brighten. you are a good person and you deserve support when you re having hard times. that s what community is about.
you are not alone melonie we are here for you  toda la comunidad te quiere  no te dejes vencer  y no estes sola en tu casa  llama gente que se quede cerca tuyo  animos genia!
being emotional over support is natural and shows you to be empathetic. best wishes on your case  i understand and hopefully the courts will too and put this man away from your life. stay safe and thank you to everyone who supported melonie in this difficult time for her.
this video was as authentic as it gets and gave me the chills. don t be embarrassed or delete it. we re all looking forward to seeing you put this situation behind you and the support will be there if the war chest runs out. hang in there
melonie you are too precious and good hearted. we are all here for you. this is not a situation anyone should be in. stay strong and safe.
you are loved more than you could possibly know. life has many hills  and this too shall pass. you will get your normalcy again soon. nobody on all of social media is more genuine than you. i ll support and be there for you as long as it takes. so hold your head up high  because we are all here for you!
also i paused the crowdfunding campaign because i didn t want it to exceed what i needed for this. i don t know what that is gonna be  but either way it is paused right now. thank you all so much  i m so grateful and overwhelmed by all the support. i am too overwhelmed to even know what to say beyond that  but thank you all so much for everythingedit  i ve gotten a lot of requests to unpause the campaign so i did. i have no idea if i need more or less than i already have now  no pressure at all to anyone else to have to contribute in that way. thank you all again  for the prayers and all the support
all of your fans support you melonie. you ll get through this. we pray for a good outcome. god bless you!
this is why i like you az.  you said you aren t nice but you ve got the heart of a lion.
you the man az!
az is such a gentleman
100  we all got your back. like az said  you re not weak  you re a champ.
preach  az.  you re awesome too.
w az
stay strong girl  we got your back.
@fabric soundz yes it really sucks. i had to deal with a few individuals on a game i played. it go so bad i had to quit the game after 7 years of playing. a small group of people drove me away from something i love and it all started with 1 person being a toxic psychopath. the situation went on for 10 months and left me depressed  panicked  and scared. i couldn t sleep and my appetite suffered. people were calling my home saying crazy stuff. on the game disgusting lies were being spread about me. like melonie said  all i wanna do is play video games.  that is call i cared about  playing the game i liked so much. and for literally no reason crazy people made my life hell. even worse  the company that ran the game did nothing. i tried talking to their customer support but they simply wouldn t do anything about it because the things being said were over voice chat in the game. so unless i had a recording of the stuff being said and my phone number being given out there was nothing they could do. and for the record i never gave anyone my number. it s a real shame some of these companies are never accountable for the behavior on their games.
the az!!! my man!!!
she s been asking for help for months now.  and still she can t get a restraining order.if law enforcement doesn t consider this guy a stalker  why should i
but he didnt ask for help because the guy thinks she is his repayment for a slight against him.  look he clearly needs to take some kind of ssri and after that adopt a kitten after thats done and meds kick in maybe he can talk to somebody as to not be a threat.  i mean she should invest in flood lights outside of her house but look the guy needs help.  also i would say she should play boy wizard and not stream for awhile to let it all simmer down
thank you az. you re voicing exactly as i think.
it s a hand up  not a hand out. we all need it from time to time. melanie is awesome.
@major david  lol you put your faith in the law system like that  that is very sheepish
@patrick henry  its just how englishmen are
true legend az
believe all women.i m much more inclined to trust law enforcement on this than an emotional egirl who has done nothing but accuse this guy of the worst things possible.
dude same  girl deserves all the hugs right now
next stalker in the making
wich jeremy  quatering or g g  she forgot to mention that
@sjoerd derks  the quartering
if there is one thing we can say about jeremy is that when one of his people needs help he ll go above and beyond to help them  we can t say the same about a lot of people he stood up for in the past  though
jeremy is a genuinely great guy.
we give what we can to those who need. besides a good deal of us are melonie fans too. sending my prayers for your safety and a calmness in your heart
@steven a  in truth both of them  melanie s situation was mentioned on friday night tights. she a legion of supporters now.
jeremy hambly  quartering  has had his fair share of being abused ...like assaulted    look up his attack at a convention once. thats when i first found him  and seeing how he handled it i ve been following him  on yt  not stalking   . i wish melonie the best thru this hard time
@steven a  ew  i hate that guy
@thezwolf  ok
unfortunately  he frequently interjects on behalf of whiners like crowder.
@thezwolf  either you hate him or love him  he is helping people that in need. what are you doing with your life
it s called family  that s what family does!
jeremy turned into a little crybaby when he found out that tim pool didn t wanna tweet him anymore. that was some cringe internet drama.
lol bush.
we re old school.
@subflow22   whiners  the guy literally steps up on behalf of small creators  does not engage in personal beef unlike the people who outed themselves and literally turned red in the face in rage...and he s the whiner. lmfao
he really is a stand-up guy.  good for him.
jeremy is a good person  it reflects in his enemies.
dude has started more fundraising things for people than i ve had hot meals. lol. they always do well and it s because he makes it clear  like him or hate him  the cause he s taking up for isn t for him. it s to help people in need of support and is usually community based in some way too......also  don t mess with cats. dude will make it his mission to get justice for cats. but yeah  he s legitimately the one creator who mobilises his audience to support others  with no benefit to himself  occasionally for people who might not even like him that much. gotta respect that. i do wish he wouldn t talk about elon so damn much though.
@raptros doesn t need to be someone he knows. if he sees someone he can help  he will. it s not about how he feels about people  it s about doing what he perceives to be the right thing if people are being mistreated.
i m not giving these rich content creators a dime until law enforcement actually issues a restraining order.if law enforcement actually considered this guy a stalker then why won t they give her a restraining order
@revenge of the netherrealm  lol  i m sorry for being mean to your dad replacement
@major david  the law kinda doesn t take stuff like that serious enough  in most places
@thezwolf  do you hate him because you are being told to hate him by other leftists  or do you genuinely watch his content and hate him  couple years ago i was a wokist. the worst thing someone could do was show me a ben shapiro video. i thankfully grew out of it and find a lot of empathy and reasonable discussion on the right.
@thezwolf  but your mom said otherwise.
@darkpope666  good comeback   idk what you re even talking about little timmy but i m sure daddy jeremy will be proud of you
how do we find the crowdfund
but where can i donate  i want to help too.
@spirit of 1976  the drive is already over  went over the goal in no time lol.
@thezwolf  nobody cares how you feel about jeremy here
@talynstarburst  ok people seem to care enough to throw insults around and get upset so yeah
@thezwolf  seems that you are doing just that from what i m seeing here lol. you can t tell me that you weren t seeking attention when you stated your feelings about someone people was talking highly of here
@thezwolf   lol as you just proved my point. your resentfulness is obvious here
@talynstarburst  alright buddy cry me a river about it honestly
@thezwolf  i m not the one crying  but nice try on projecting your feelings here. like i said.. nobody cares about how you feel.. you just want attention and can t admit it. stay angry
@talynstarburst  as said you seem to care a lot but nice try pretending not to care
@thezwolf  caring would be asking you why you feel that way.. nobody asked and you cannot seem to grasp that concept because you just wanted the attention here as i pointed out. i simply made an observation and called you out for what i see here  and you haven t been able to deny any of it so far.
that illness of hers made her cry in the end
@talynstarburst  no  you are mad and thus care that i dislike your replacement dad
@thezwolf  lol you still at this  stop making up things and just admit that i am right.. you are so triggered over this guy
@talynstarburst  well i m done  i don t think i could keep up with the no life quartering fanbase i ve got better things to do
@thezwolf  lol i don t even love or hate the guy here  despite what someone else said in this forum .. i just think it s funny when people like you get so triggered with the mention of his name that you have to make a comment about it for validation on your hurt feelings.  bye
for real. i haven t seen such a close and supportive community on youtube alone  even channels with millions of subs aren t this tight. that just shows the kind of character she has.
well said!
this
yep well said. this is truth
absolutely!
not for melanie but because i despise freaks never being punished
exactly
@major david  i ve had many discussions with friends and family who ve said i m not gonna cry but are clearly about to when talking about serious situations. almost like people have these things called emotions and crying when overwhelmed is a natural thing
@major david  is this a serious comment  you don t have to be an fbi profiler to plainly see that the person in this video is overwhelmed by the situation she is in.
@major david  a restraining order doesn t apply. she could seek a protective order  but the first step is reporting to the police and collecting evidence  which she s done. hoping that was enough to get him to back off was a kindness to him that she shouldn t be dragged for
restraining order  protection order  same thing in different states.law enforcement has a more balanced view on these things than an emotional egirl who only tells her side of the story.  judging by her previous videos and tweets  it s almost guaranteed several of her claims are going to be exaggerated  if not outright false.i m not going to let a highly biased video by either person determine my judgement on this.  law enforcement is a better judge of the truth   so far they ve said neither he or her are stalkers.
you ve blessed our lives  melonie. and we want to do all that we can to support  help and bless you too.
you deserve all the love and support you get. we love you and care about you.
i wish i could do more to help you  melonie. you re an amazing person and a good friend. you are loved because of how genuine you are and how much you ve inspired people by sharing your message of faith and diet and going to the gym.
please rest up and take the time you need. your safety and well being are priority over anything. you have friends  family and god. god bless and  massive prayers out for you.
courage.
you re one of a kind melonie  you ll be back to enjoying what you love before you know it. i m including you in my nightly prayers for your safety and i know the rest of us are too. you got this.
if you think you need more  and need to unpause  but are still worried about going over  add the disclaimer that any unused funds will go to a charity of your choice. i think your community would be fine donating under those terms. at the end you could even have a bit of fun with it  pick your 5 favorite charities and have a community poll or something. i know anytime you add money to a situation things get more complex  and because of that you don t want to fuel the weirdos who will accuse women of profiting off these situations  but at the same time  you shouldn t have to stress yourself trying to prove where every penny went. your audience has a lot of trust in you as a good human being.
how about donate any extra money from the fundraiser to like  a women s shelter
we re here for ya! so sorry this is affecting you the way it is. just unplug and play some games.
bruh not even a week wtf
this is way beyond drama this is some lunatic messing with your life that is beyond drama so please stay safe do what you need to do be strong like tomb raider and go boom on their butts
stay strong melonie  you ve got a massive fanbase and a living god watching over you. have faith in him. praying for you!
unpause it. you earned it by the entertainment you give us. let people give towards the gofundme  lawyers cost a lot. i hope this gets resolved quickly and you can get some peace of mind.
melonie we got your back n becareful
it is going to be more than you think. if anything goes to court  it will be ridiculous amounts of money every single time.i m with mooseot above  just put a disclaimer about excess funds and put them towards a good cause.
as someone who has gone throught this sorry to say all i can offer you a imaginary internet hug !!!!!!    please stay safe  3 stick with family if you have too
we just want you to play your favorite games too melonie. hogwarts hasn t been the same without you in it this past week. just know that your community loves you and supports you for the wonderful person you are and nothing s going to change that. it ll be broomsticks and levioso s again in no time
i didn t want... ... i just want.... we know    it s all good  i don t think anyone ever thought that
stay stong melonie
definitely sending you prayers and good thoughts.
you re a genuinely good person and this will pass soon enough. we ve got your back. stay safe and stay healthy
hey melonie. you re in an impossible situation if you can do good  god will honor it. like others have said send the rest to charity close to your heart or that combats situations similar to yours. pax dei
stay strong melonie
get some rest. drink something warm  i recommend cider.
any time legalities are involved  there s no such thing as too much money. i m assuming you haven t been involved in such before. do not be afraid to keep it open. good luck  may your god be with you in this fight.
be strong  carry on.
breathe  don t let this punk stress you out. your all good and the courts will see it.
you are a great person and deserve all the good things   god bless you  he is with you.   we love ya!
you ve exceeded your goal because people care and want to see you are safe. looking forward to seeing this put behind you so you can smile  laugh  and discuss nerd culture or anything else on your mind.
don t let that loser get you down!
came over from jeremy at the quatering i m so sorry you ve had to deal with this madness
stay headstrong! gamers rise! creepers fall!
remember to pray about it too gurl and im glad you stay strapped ..
re-open it melonie  there could be expenses beyond a lawyer you should consider  alarm camera systems  gun  training  self protection k9 etc  as a former police officer i strongly recommend you consider all of this and more.
i don t think anyone would be bothered by you using the money  that they wanted to donate to you  for personal reasons. your life is your brand and i think people know that so we want you to be happy. the transparency is refreshing but anything over your goal  i think everyone knows and is choosing to add more with the idea that it s something else that can help you through this difficult moment like needing to take an extended break or whatever. your income shouldn t have to be affected by some whack job. you do want to get right back into things and that s fine if you feel ready but if it s not the right time  there s no weakness in admitting that.
we are your community and in a community supports each other. i wasn t able to donate because money is tight for me but i m wishing you the best with getting this creep out of your life so that your safety is assured.
are you okay melonie mac

buy guns and ammo with the rest and stay safe
good on you
you given  us your time and attention with your amazing videos. we all want to help make sure you re safe and able to stay safe. you deserve every penny and all the help. keep us in the loop and take all the needed time off until this is over. these things are stressful and suck. do what you need to do for your mental and physical health.
if you raise too much you can always do something good with what s left over.. hold in there it will all get sorted out in the end
i m sorry your shit all weird nel ya seem like a sweet girl ya dont deserve this. take care bud.
hey  melanie mac go boom  if you need to take some downtime  we will wait until you are ready  your safety is more important  and your state mind  we will wait  it s ok
that s a great idea  wanting to be transparent about the costs!! then  maybe donate the extra money  if there is any to a organization that helps abused women  just a thought. stay strong!! you got this.
melonie  you are 100  right on one thing and 100  wrong on another.  before i get pounced upon  let me start by saying you are absolutely right that you did nothing to deserve this pain and anguish.  it has nothing to do with you  and everything to do with the one causing you harm.  but i can t let you go on thinking you did nothing to deserve all the love and support  both emotional and financial that your community  and extended community of the quartering and other such creators gave you  and will continue to to give until this is firmly behind you.  you are a kind  virtuous and authentic person.  those traits are nearly unheard of in online spaces like youtube.  too often  we - your community  have seen beloved creators fall to fame and fortune  cowed by fear of financial ruin  who then turn into the very thing the appeared to fight against.  not you.  you are a beacon of hope and a champion of this community.  i must be honest that i teared up hearing the pain in your voice  there is no need for embarrassment.  we all understand this is something you do not want  and would never do for clout  or financial gain.  it is strength to show vulnerability  and it took a lot of strength to put your true emotions out there.  i know that all of us would stand as an army before anything that would seek to do you harm.  so please  take comfort that we are here  your loyal fans and subscribers  seeking to help you in the meager ways we can.  should you open the campaign again  many more will provide for you  some again  some for the first time.  take it all with love and respect.
you should turn it back on.  you never know how your situation will change.  those donating know that it s exceeded it s goal  and are just donating to support you  regardless.
open letter to sean the stalker. please come to montana so i can take you on  free hunting trip.. you will get a blast i mean you will have a blast. please get ahold of me if you want to go elk hunting in montana.
jeremy will be relaying an offer from me to you. i mean it. i ll help ya out with my skills if you want. get my email from him or have him reply to me if you want. take care and be careful.
hey melonie  difficult times for many people and now you have to deal with creepy person  lets praying for this the solved quickly as possible.
we will continue to support you.  we re gamers  we stick together.
you should start it up again and whatever you dont spent give it to a chairy or some kind.
i m sorry that you re going through all this. it s important to note for followers to not harass the stalker in return as it s counterproductive. i believe there s every reason for him to be in prison at this point  but we want to keep mel looking good in this position. we have mel s back here  so let s look like it. melonie  i hope you never deal with another situation like this again. i don t know you personally  but i just enjoy seeing your content from time to time. i want to keep seeing you on this site for a long time.
i feel so sorry for you melonie  you don t deserve any of this hardship and i wish i could help.
keep the funding going  use what you need of it and then bank the rest of it into a defense fund for other people going through the same thing
god bless you and maybe take a day off for your health and voice and drink lots of hot tea. i m sure if there is money left over from the legal battle  no one would mind if you donated it to a good charity. or maybe even better spend some on better locks  etc. get a pro in there to harden your home.
isaiah 41 10 fear not  for i am with you  be not dismayed  for i am your god  i will strengthen you  i will help you  i will uphold you with my righteous right hand
my heart breaks for you  and what you are going through. no one deserves to have that happen to them. you are in my thoughts and prayers. god bless and keep you.
hang in there melonie. psalm 1431 hear my prayer  o lord     give ear to my pleas for mercy!    in your faithfulness answer me  in your righteousness!2 enter not into judgment with your servant     for no one living is righteous before you.3 for the enemy has pursued my soul     he has crushed my life to the ground     he has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.4 therefore my spirit faints within me     my heart within me is appalled.5 i remember the days of old     i meditate on all that you have done     i ponder the work of your hands.6 i stretch out my hands to you     my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. selah7 answer me quickly  o lord!    my spirit fails!hide not your face from me     lest i be like those who go down to the pit.8 let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love     for in you i trust.make me know the way i should go     for to you i lift up my soul.9 deliver me from my enemies  o lord!    i have fled to you for refuge.10 teach me to do your will     for you are my god!let your good spirit lead me    on level ground!11 for your name s sake  o lord  preserve my life!    in your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble!12 and in your steadfast love you will cut off my enemies     and you will destroy all the adversaries of my soul     for i am your servant.
keep your chin up and overcome . and you have the right to feel sad and also have fun . this will soon be over for you and now focus on your self and the people that care about you. don t talk about this guy anymore.
bruh   you re in with the quartering crew  we got each other s backs.  its just what we do   asking isn t always necessary. it s going to get back to normal   im sure of it.  we ve got your back  please take care of yourself
you deserve better melonie. hang in there. --my mom always says  put it in gods hands and take comfort in knowing that he never gives you more than you can handle. you just have to have faith.  and of course i say something sarcastic and don t listen  but still  i do think the advice is sound.   p.s. thanks for what u do. ur streams vids have def cheered me up more than once.
i know it your cold  but you sound so upset i ve never wanted to give somebody a big hug so much in my life.
melonie you are a good girl and ofc we support you as good as we can and we all looking forward to your ima biggot walkthrough but take your time you are not a robot so look for you first we will understand it
don t pause the crowd fund  use any excess to support someone else dealing with a similar situation that may not have the reach that yours has.
we love you melonie please be safe!! you have all the love and support in the world  may god bless you protect you and keep you safe always and may you be blessed with justice in court
god bless you melonie
i hope you handle it  you are great  you do not deserve creepy situation  especially you are polite and modest and kind. i hope you will play hogwarts soon. go boom.
you just want peace... hope that man goes away... hope he understands... if not hope the lord puts him in his place... and gets the lord s wrath...
stay strong mel! you earned any and all you raise just by being an genuinely honest and good person. we all have your back and nobody thinks you are looking to abuse the crowdfunding in any way. my prayers are with you that this passes quickly so you can get back to what makes you happy!
i will say if you believe in carrying a weapon.  get your concealed weapons certification and carry a small gun that can fit anywhere on you so you have something for protection.  there is nothing wrong in being protective bc in some crazy situation it may be you or him.  the second amendment still holds up for some of us and it does for you too.
where is the crowd funding link
you re aren t just a ray of sunshine melonie  you re the whole sun.you have your faith  friends that support you  and a fanbase that has your back.you ll get through this and come out the other side stronger than before.
all i can say is this is heartbreaking  really sorry. you help so many people just being yourself. miss seeing your streams and can see how happy gaming and your community makes you  so it s hard to see this happening. thoughts are with you  mel.
don t delete this  you stay strong and ignore this person he is not worth your time.  you keep enjoying streaming what you want.  you are an awesome person.
you ve got a ton of people that love you. absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about. that guys a maniac and i can t wait for you to get this behind you so you can move on with your life. i m praying for you every day. melomaniac 4 life.
biggit army strong. we re praying for you melonie.
my heart goes out to you melonie. stay strong. stay healthy. and stay safe. most importantly remember that you are not alone.
stay strong!!!  you are a positive voice in the gaming community!!  your smile uplifts so many people in such a dark world.
i know comments don t do much but i do hope you at least feel better while reading them and that this horrible situation is resolved as soon as possible so you don t have to stress about it any longer.
everyone deserves to be safe  and everyone needs help from time to time. thats what a community is for  we have to stand up for one another. especially in this crazy timeline we are living in lol
it sucks that this is happening to you . i hope it gets sorted out soon.  keep smiling and stay positive  amiga.  we are here for you    and we appreciate you.
it s okay melonie! we all love you will always be here for you and don t hesitate to let know if you need more help! we re more than happy to help. you re amazing melonie and god bless!
hang in there melonie... i can only guess how stressful this must all be. take whatever time you need  we re all here for you.
we love you melonie!  just remember you aren t alone.  you are stronger than you know and have so much support.  we are all here to help.  i ll continue to pray for you and hope this situation gets resolved.
first time i v ever seen melonie cry. i ll pray for you girl as u level up to be strong and strike back at that stalker sean. you look so good in that red sweater. i also remember that last video that baby blue sweater you wore in court goes perfect with that ponytail.
praying for a speedy resolution to all of this  melonie. stay strong  stay safe and god bless!
thanks for the update! hopefully  the campaign showed how much support you have and gave you some piece of mind.  i m sure you ll be back to doing what you love in no time!
hey  melonie  just remember... you faced back-to-back issues of hospitalization  dehydration and your stalker back in december... but you came roaring back from all that better than ever!you re going to get through this and bounce back yet again. sean s just a sad old man who really needs to read the room and focus on people and issues of his own age... like which flavor of metamucil is best.i ve watched you bounce back before  and i know i m going to see it again. i don t believe god would have brought you as far as he s brought you only to have a situation this absurd stop you. you have so many rooting for you and praying for you. we re here for you  and you re going to get past this and get back to doing what you do best  dropping truth  standing for god  and bringing the chaotic hufflepuff sass
prayers for a speedy recovery and that the stalker gets drowned in legal fees
stay safe  of course  but don t let one person bring you down when you have an entire army ready and willing to support you. i think the fame that you do have -- willingly or not -- is a result of fulfilling a purpose that was destined for you. for all we know  this could be a test of fortitude along that path. stay strong. this will eventually and inevitably pass.
i m so sorry you re going through this crap but i m glad you re getting so much support. this creep needs to get a life. i wish you well. love you and stay strong
who drafted me  when
lol we are in the army now
amen
proud to serve in the macarmy!
metamucil this is facts though.
i m only 34 and i can confidently say... orange is best.

mel  just so you know the amount of support you have gotten through this you deserve every bit of it. you seem like a very awesome and genuine person. when you did those verse for the days at the end of your videos those definitely helped me feel better through some difficult days. you seem like you have a great personality and all your supporters feel that way i am sure. just keep strong and i hope that you can be done with this for good. much love to mel. keep your head up
we got your back  melonie. prayers for peace and protection
feel better soon melonie. be safe! we all have your back.
praying for melonie! you are amazing and didn t do anything to deserve this  rest up and stay safe! you have and army of fans that love what you do and we have your back.
for all you give in entertaining us. wish it was under better circumstances but we get to give you something back and if it helps keep you safe then all the better. stay sane  stay safe.  you have a community behind you and this freak has no one.
rest easier knowing there s way more love and support than hate and vitriol
i feel so bad for her. she doesn t deserve any of this. god bless you melanie. things are gonna look up for you soon! don t stop streaming because of this lunatic.
she s just like the sister you want to protect.
unlike the stalker  you have god on your side! we ll be praying for you
you ll get through this mel. we are here for you and praying for you  3
just when you think you know how many people s lives you ve touched... the rest come marching over the hill.  we really enjoy your channel.  we re here for you.
you re an honest and genuine person which is very rare today it seems. some people get a lot of support in situations like this bc they deserve it and you re one of those that deserves it.
breaks my heart to see you cry. you are so strong. you got this. i ve barely seen much of your content  but i like it and like the rest of your followers  we got your back. my prayers are with you
it breaks my heart that you re having to deal with this. i hope this gets resolved quickly and permanently. saying prayers for you.
we re here for you. please take care of yourself melonie.
stay strong girl   i don t know how it feels directly  but listening to you says a lot. you got me all choked up. i m not an expert on things but through my life s experiences i do know a little on a lot of things. if that makes any sense. know this that things will get better in time  really. i will throw in a little word to god when i pray. try to take it easy try to get some quality sleep if you can. if you live near the ocean or close by a nice walk on the beach on the shore line bare footed  and watch that sun go down works wonders to your soul. well for me it did. it s one of the few perks that california s still have. also stay hydrated with quality distilled water. it really works wonders.  so know that we like your channel and specially when you quote bible verses out. really cool.
we ve got your back melonie  it sucks there s trash like these people out there.
there will always be bad people trying to tear down good people. and you do deserve the help and support from others. you re a good person and you help a lot of other people
i hope you can heal from this  seeing you cry and hearing your voice sound different  is a serious sign of help
melonie  i couldn t help but think of the sunday school song  this little light of mine   after this video and following the troubles you ve been going through. don t let this dim nor snuff your light out. you will get through this! prayers to you and your family. and to this man as odd as that sounds to people.
exactly.
or...or...and bare with me...or both are on their own and the universe is a random  chaotic place without a god
how do you know no one s praying for the stalker
folks  you are both entitled to your beliefs  as i am entitled to mine. that is all i wish to say. have a great day
@micheal freeman  i am but not the way many milquetoast christians would.
@aaron p.  hey  agnostic atheist here  these people have something that gives them a lot of comfort  most atheists too have a fear of death and the infinite and have their own ways of conforting themselves. christians are mostly harmless  it doesn t make you smarter or enlightened for not being one. you wouldn t like it if somebody came around and started poking holes in your life raft that keeps your anxiety down  i wish you the best  the real ones are some pretty incredible people concerned mostly with relationship and striving to be better people  do you really want to take that away from people in the first place
@anon ymouse  can there even be an  agnostic  atheist  i am an agnostic myself. atheists are set in the inconclusive stance that there is absolutely no god. an agnostic generally believes that humans don t have the knowledge or capability to know if there is a god or not. the part of me that believes in the possibility of a god thinks it s not something that most religious individuals perceive it as  but something that we can t possibly understand. also  there could be nothing. that s why i find atheists almost as cocky and foolish  making profound statements as truth that are simply inconclusive. all i merely did was share the broad other half of many potential beliefs i consider.
i m so sorry  melonie. you look like you need a big hug and i m so sorry you re going through this  stay strapped and please please get a guard dog. cane corso or german shepherd  just in case. godspeed  mel...not too religious but i ll pray for you  bigot army has your back!
stay safe mel  i wish there was more we could do to protect you from this creep. you ve got a loyal fan base and true friends by your side.
i don t always agree with your opinions  but no one deserves this and you re genuinely one of the sweetest people and a great caming. getting emotional is fine and shows you re just one of us nerds. you ll always have us here for you and we ll all support you. btw  seeing you cry definitely hit me in the feels and i hope you get to have the life you want. ty for letting us know what s happening to you.
when my sister was younger she went through a similar experience and seeing your pain brings it all back.  the good news is once you get over this  you will be fine and this will be a distant dream.
you don t have to apologize. i feel so bad that you re going through this.
you got this melonie. god sees you and is with you. he will not let you down. stay strong  you will get through this
3 jeremy is a good guy.  i wouldn t have known any of this without watching his video and allowed me to help donate.
never be embarrassed about sharing your feelings with those that care about you.  i hope this mess can be sorted out quickly so you can get on with what you want to be doing.  go boom
keep your head up  stay strong  stay positive and keep god in your corner. he s walking with you through this process and he s never going to leave your side. best of luck melonie
just started following you recently and been enjoying your work! that sounds like a rough situation. i m glad you re getting the help you need. i hope your situation improves.

hang in there!   praying for you!
you gotta look at it in the way that you also didn t sign up for the crazy situation either  so all the help you re getting is just what happens when decent people do good things. hopefully everything will work itself out in the most positive way for ya

i m so sorry you ve been battling this pain!!! i hope life gets back to calm and normal for you quickly as well!
this is absolutely heartbreaking man.  i can t imagine what you are going through right now.  i hope and pray that your attorney does everything in his power to protect you and protect your rights.damn it man  why do bad things always happen to good people  continue pushing forward melonie. we all have your back.
you are doing awesome. that is a very hard thing to share. breathe buddy  you got this! you inspire me.
aww melonie  i m sorry this psycho is putting you through this. you got the support you did because your community has love for you. you got this. thoughts and prayers your way for sure.
hang tough.  you may not realize it but you have given a lot of strength to others from your videos.  especially when you talk about faith.  it has helped more than you know.  that s why so many want to return that support when they see you need it.  hopefully you will never stop being you.
he must feel awesome making a girl cry. you have people in your life and the community is behind you. be strong  have faith and this will be over soon! you got this  melonie! i m sure god s in your corner too!
i m so sorry you re going through this. sending you lots of love and support.
sending up prayers for you.  put all of this in god s hands  and you will get through this stronger than ever!
i will be praying for you  mel. i can really hear the stress in you voice. i can t imagine how scary this is for you. do your best to keep this mess out of your head  as much as necessary. just remember we your community  your family and friends have your back in this. if you need to take a break or whatever we ll understand. just make sure you re taking care of yourself.
hopefully your lawyer and the courts can get things taken care of in a timely manner. sending positive vibes and a big internet hug as it looks like you could use one.
this really hurts to see you this way  just know we re here to support you. myself and others here will always have your back. please please be safe  you re definitely one of the most humble people i follow and you don t deserve this. keep your head up though  we love you and you re not alone.
we all support you on this  anything over what s needed  i m sure most people would be happy with a good charity donation  stay safe and take care
you deserve every bit of the love and support you are getting. you bring so much joy to so many people. the least we can do is come together as a community and support you in your times of need. no thanks are required. just keep being you and hang in there. we got you.
we are here for you melonie  you are our big sister  we are going to be praying for you  everyday  stay strong big sis  god bless you!!!
you deserve safety and happiness mel. please stay strong. you have more people  that have your back than you realize
donated yesterday after watching the quartering. you deserve your peace darlin ... the jerk   his game will be a non-issue shortly. stand strong   be well. blessed be
years of honest true to yourself content and hard work is what you did to earn your fan base support melonie. all those years of just being you.......
my heart goes out to you melonie. i hope this situation ends soon. be brave  this too shall pass.
stay strong mel my thoughts and prayers are with you.
you have an amazing support coming your way. the people who you are connected to like the quartering are all very good people. you will soon look back at this like it was just a bump in the road. try to squeeze some time in for yourself through all of this even though it is hard.
i hear that!i liked it when she used to do a short reading from the bible at the end of her videos. she did that for quite a while  and i can see how that might put some people off but she kept doing it which at least showed she s genuine.but  yeah   hearing her talk about her faith did help me with mine in a way so i m grateful for that. i m sure she ll be o.k.
i wish you best  hope this issue gets resolved expeditiously and permanently  and you won t strain yourself in the process. take your time  fight the good fight and remember that you re not a bad person - you re a very good person that a bad thing happened to. and it s a thing that shouldn t ever have happened to anyone  especially someone like you  who helps so many others on a daily basis with your content.
you didn t ask for this drama  but you are an awesome person  that s why people are supporting you. so it s not that  you didn t do anything to deserve the positive support   because people wouldn t be doing it if they didn t feel like you serve it for being a good person who didn t ask for this drama.
praying for you  melonie!  may the lord watch over you  and protect you emotionally   and mentally.  i m sorry you have endure the overwhelming attention of a disturbed person.  i entered into a relationship with someone last summer  and i came to found out how disturbed she really was.  i was fortunate to get away unscathed  and she never had the resources to find me afterwards.  nowhere near disturbed as the person you re dealing with  but the manipulation  gaslighting  blameshifting  shaming language   emotional games really kept me off balance  my own safety  and made me doubt my own sanity.  it is my prayer that your sense of security   peace of mind is restored quickly.  and that there are legal ramifications for the perp esp. his loss of freedom.  take care  melonie.
hate it when shizz shows up at your doorstep and you accidentally step in it. you deserve all the support you can get mel.    just remember we are all here and love you .  you ve helped me alot by watching your videos when things aren t going so well. you re appreciated.
this is honestly heartbreaking to see how this is affecting you  i know you re strong and you will get through this and i hope you can get all the financial help you need! sending you prayers
it seems like you are taking all of the necessary steps to get this situation sorted out and you also have tons of support. understandably this kind of thing does suck and should never happen. i feel like you will come out victorious from all of this madness.
hi melonie  just wanted to say you ll get through this dark cloud period. keeping pushing the good fight. i really felt it when you said  all i want to do is play video games  nothing will stop that. just a horrible blimp in the road. we all supporting you and we appreciate how open you are on this. you re not alone. fans  followers  your good friends and family are behind you. hope this does blow over quickly.
prayers for your situation  girl. you take care of yourself and stay safe!
stress will wreck an immune system. take care of yourself.
you re a good person. take a break. you not only deserve it. everyone needs a break from time to time.
i am so sorry you are going threw this. i had an ex that had a stalker and it made both out lives problematic for quite a while.   be strong  you will overcome this and karma will catch up to him somehow.   this experience will make you stronger.
i m so sorry you are going through this... i hope you have friends family around that can help you... my family is praying for you.
stay strong  and don t let this discourage you. i don t know what i can say to help  but if you need to take a break you should. everyone needs some mental health time. i m confident i can speak for all of us when i say we ll be here when you get back!
we have you back melonie your the sweetest person in our circle!!! one of us!! one of us!!
save your receipts melonie  we don t need to see them. we know what you re going through  and we don t mind helping you out. we know you re not a grifter and you re not trying to make money from this.you have earned our support by standing up to bullies  and speaking your mind about what is right.i think i can speak for everyone when i say we only want you to be safe!and please try to remember  even if god likes to challenge us sometimes  he never gives us more than we can handle. you re strong and you will get through this!
dude you seem like an awesome human. i stumbled across your channel from another ytber that mentioned your situation.i hope any extra money can help you get back to normal  you certainly don t deserve this psycho.
what you are doing is important because you are reaching many people with your faith and showing them that they are not alone.
so sorry you are going through this. you are super appreciated- you remind me that there are good people out there that think clearly and believe in the right things. it s hard to see in the middle of it  but i m sure this will work out how it s meant to.
get well soon melonie. and stand strong  god s got your back and this unfortunate situation will blow over soon enough.
we ve got your back  melonie! don t give up. so kind of jeremy to reach out

giving someone anxiety about being stressed out won t help either will it
@allennium falcon   neither will freaking someone out about giving someone anxiety about being stressed out.
@mr. dancy pants   freaking out over someone speaking out that freaking out about stress will cause anxiety and heighten someones stress levels who is already stressed and has enough on their plate to deal with.
@mr. dancy pants   ohhh you better calm down or you ll have a heart attack  most helpful phrase ever to someone who is going through horrible stress. not
@allennium falcon    just don t be sad  - the cure for depression
@mr. dancy pants  yeah it doesn t work so easily. same with stress and anxiety. telling someone to calm down or else dun dun dunnnn doesn t quite help. even though people who say it mean well and have the best intentions. so i m not looking to disrespect you and i m sorry if i have in any way. we all want to help.
@allennium falcon   i commented initially as someone who is regularly sick from having a jacked up immune system due to stress  commiserating with someone who has gone through a lot of stress and is now sick. that s all. self-care is important.honestly  i thought you and i were having a bit if a south park   he s not your buddy  pal!   i m not your pal  guy!  moment.text is hard to gather context from at times  so i don t let it bother me too much and try to assume that the person replying means the best  not the worst.
@mr. dancy pants  i understand. i suffer from ptsd. i m sorry to hear of your condition. you re a strong person for living with it and you have my respect. bless you.
i m not about to cry  begins to crytotally kidding mel love you really hope everything goes back to normal for you
you get support because you re a wonderful human being. what you do to deserve it is that you brighten up other people s day with your personality and your wit and your basic human decency.
we love you melonie! stay safe! and definitely keep us updated!   especially when the court stuff happens. we ve all got your back 100
i hate the awful creeps that feel they are entitled to someone and prey on them to the point they make a person feel unsafe and try to break their spirit. keep your head up. know that you have people in your life that support you and want the best for you. stay strong and show that cretin you won t let him break you
someone give her a much needed hug!!
you ll be alright melonie. you got this. i hope you ll be on sometime on fnt.
listening to this at the gym  you may not be crying  but i just want to send you a hug  heck i know we all do darlin. you have a heart for god and know that he is always with you  and as a man of god i will keep praying for you. god bless and again  i am sending hugs your way.
you don t have to do anything to earn kindness from others hun. being honest  kind  and thoughtful is all the reason anyone should ever need to help someone else.
hang in there!   i became a fan of you when i watched your interview with chrissie last year and enjoy your takes on various things. i can sense you are a strong person and will get through this.
i m so sorry this is happening melonie  god bless you
stay strong melonie. we are with you and we will support you. everyone has lower moments in their lives so no need to be embarrassed. but those sad moments will pass and eventually the sun will come out again
i am so sorry you re going through all this. we re with you melonie!
you didn t deserve the stalker  but you do deserve the support. we are your fellow nerds and gamers! having been a part of this community for two decades  i ve always been proud of what a supportive bunch we are  especially when one of us is threatened. let us support you  we all know you would do the same for us.
it s heartbreaking to see ya like this. really hate to see this happen to anyone  much less someone who seems so nice. god has got your back  hang in there  keep your head up  we are all praying for you
got back home and saw melonie uploaded a new video and i had to show her some more support we r all here for u sis god bless and keep up the amazing work u do making great content
i m really sorry to hear this is happening to you. hang in there  melonie.
stay strong melonie. everything will work out. your friends and fans have your back  always.
stay strong melonie  you have an entire community behind you. we all want to do what we can to help and make sure you can be safe. nobody deserves to go through this.
we all love ya melonie. i pray the lord gives you his peace  and delivers you from all this madness.
im sorry you dealing with all this but i am happy you are not doing it alone and have people around you who care about you. you will pull through this and get back to just enjoying the good things without the drama and we will all be here to enjoy it with you.
heh  i thought that. i don t like seeing her all upset like this  because she s usually got such a happy personality  it s a shame she s having to go through all this   i find it a bit weird that she would put this video out because it kind of makes her look vulnerable  but i suppose it s good that she s keeping her viewers updated with what s going on so we don t have to guess.i m sure it will all work out well in the end. she s a good lass.
she definitely was crying that was no cold
@adam clark  that s what i m getting too
@adam clark  it was both
hope all of this is sorted soon for you. crazies are out there and i hope you get all the help you need
this situation just makes me so mad that you have to go through this but you do deserve the support melonie.
stay strong girl  you got this and everyone is behind you!
take care and get well.we re rooting for you!
rise above the storm  you will see sunshine  stay strong melonie  we re here for you
hope you get this settled pretty soon and put this madness behind you  feel better. stay strong and be safe. you are not alone.
sorry to hear that you re going through such a frustrating and stressful situation. will keep you in my prayers.
sending prayers and support   stay strong and safe
man  this has my heart broken. i m not too fond of when crazy people cause others to break down. the fact that melonie is losing sleep over this man who probably is on some other type of ish is very concerning to us fans. but i know this will make you stronger melonie  not only as a content creator but as a person in general  folks  we have to do better. we have to educate the crazy people on how this hurts emotionally. ms.melonie  please hang tough because you will strive for greatness and success. there s a saying that when you re going through something  it s preparing you for excellence in the future. asking for help is one of the hardest things we can do. it doesn t mean you are weak or can t cope  it just means you need a shoulder to keep you going. now i have recently been a subscriber  but your video that you do have inspired me as a podcaster  filmmaker  and content creator. i love that you make all of us fans think about important topics. now i am a man of faith  so i will pray for nothing but great things as you continue your career. ceo of k.l.p entertainment kennedy lucas
stay strong melonie. we re all here for you in whatever way we can help. i wish creeps like that would just leave people alone.
i ve had to deal with a similar situation on a much lesser scale  so i can just imagine how incredibly stressful this must be. we re praying for you  sister!  god be with you.
stay strong! you ll get over this  have faith. god bless and protect you!
you re a really good person of course you deserve it! stay safe!
i hope things turn out okay for you! and i hope that weirdo gets jail time!
i only found you when hogwarts was released  or maybe you came in my feed because of the support from jeremy  idk. but don t delete this. stay strong  you will prevail.
praying for you and this situation  i hope this resolves as quickly and painlessly as possible for you
this video brought tears to my eyes. you don t deserve to have to deal with this stuff. i m sorry to hear that you have a cold i hope you feel better soon. if you ever need someone to reach out to i m always here for you melonie don t be afraid to reach out to me. i m always here for you.love you melonie stay strong   safe.
i m glad you got the support you needed! i hope this all goes away soon and you can get back to playing games! stay safe melonie!
awwwww man  i don t like seeing you like this. be happy again! this will pass and you can get back to all the things you love - stay strong  take the help offered if you feel the need and don t let anyone bring you down from your normal radiant self!
i ll pray for your safety mel.
one of my favorite quotes from ace combat 6 even after the darkest nights  dawn always comes.
i never understood why stalkers stalk i would never want to be around someone who didnt want me around.  crazy people make life so much harder.
@court manning  it s the mentality of  mine  and mine alone . for one reason or another  it just happens for some people and they can t let go. hopefully the lawyers and judge  idk if a judge is involved  will knock some sense into the stalker and he gets help.
rest  melonie. you need it. take a few days off and clear your mind. prayers to you.
your a nice person  that s why all of us follow your channel.  your kind that s how you have earned our support.
let not your heart be troubled. stay safe. and we re here for you.
it s ok to ask for help and to accept help we all deserve help with difficult scary situations ur amazing and u have worked hard to get where u are u should feel safe and happy it ll get better queen all love ur way keep fighting thru
we love and support you  melonie. you re in our prayers daily over this issue. have faith  things will be alright in the end.
i m sorry you have to go through this but we ll always have your back melonie.
we ve got your 6 melonie!   you battle on doing what you do  and try to get back to some normalcy.  everyone deserves a helping hand now and then.
wish the best for you melonie  i hope this madness passes soon. be safe! look forward to seeing more of your hogwarts legacy content!
i hope you get better. dont lose your voice. rest  fluids and gargle with salt water
mel  sorry that you are going through this. it is emotional. don t apologize for the feelings. it is always nice when people step up to help. i know i am always shocked because many times i feel alone. be blessed!
we all have your back. i hope this crazy man seeks help and stops bothering you. no one should have to go through any of this crap.
stay strong melonie. this is a rough time  but you ll come out stronger and the good parts of life will seem even brighter once it s over. keep looking forward to that.
stay strong mel  couple of years back i had a friend who was also stalked and went to the point where she was forced to leave social media all together. it is insane how fcked in the head some people are. hopping you can bounce back from this and come out stronger for it  the entire community is here for you
don t be embarrassed. thank you for being open about this.
i hope things get better  melonie. i m praying for you.
you have every right to be emotional. i ve dealt with stalkers  but not to this extent. you have the right to stream in peace without feeling in danger. i m rooting for you girl! i m so happy to see all this support for you. hang in there!
you have a humble and thankful attitude and it is great to see. i ll keep you in my prayers. keep up the good work.
praying for you melonie.  stay strong.  we have your back.
we all love you melonie. stay strong and lean on god.
we re gonna stick by you re side  especially in these trying times. hope everyone keeps you safe
im scared for her. poor girl is very scared!
yeah  you gotta be a crappy excuse for a human being to target an individual online like this. the annoying thing is his intentions are so obvious yet there are so many hoops to jump through to get him to stop. this sort of thing can t be allowed to keep happening.
melonie  you more than deserve all the love and support that you ve received thus far.  it s not a coincidence that you ve spent years telling people to stand up to bullies and now you have an army backing you up when you re faced with a bully of your own.  i can tell you that you ve had a positive impact on my life that i m so grateful for.  but for now  please take care of yourself.  when you re ready to come back to stream  we ll be here waiting for you.  take care and we ll see you soon.
i hope you get all the help you need in this crazy situation melonie  you do not deserve this at all  this man clearly needs psychological help. for you to fear for your safety is heartbreaking. stay strong  and do what makes you feel safe and happy! i look forward to seeing you play more hogwarts legacy though  so far i am loving the game myself!
we love you so much melonie! you are so kind and inspiring. god s light shines through you. we just want you safe and happy! this is scary and a lot. you don t have to be alright. i know you wanna get back to normal. but give yourself all the time you need. hugs and prayers. love you so much.
stay strong melonie  things are going to get better and you will be back to making the content you love.we are here for you!
awe  melonie! we are here for you!

don t feel embarrassed! you did nothing wrong!all the best to you and your family. stay safe and  do whatever you need to feel safe and better. noone is forced to help or support you. we did that because we wanted to and chose to  not out of pity or in expectation of something except you having the financial support you need to get through this best as possible.you deserve everything and more. just keep being you  which is pretty awesome!if you keep doing content great  if you need to take a break  take a break  we ll be there when and if you come back. just feel safe and do what you need to feel safe.
please let your true closest best friends come over  hang out with you and give you a hug when you need it. this is no time for you to fight this alone. it s clear this mess is really wearing you out. i hope this guy does decide to leave you alone  but we know how that works. please do everything you need to do to stay safe.

thank you so much  this is all so overwhelming and it really means a lot to read comments like this
melonie i hope you feel better and fight strong
as a dad this beyond infuriates me.... my daughter had someone following her around the grocery store the other day and this stalker crap is getting out of hand. most sickos aren t dealt with early enough by law enforcement and it balloons out of control. i m praying this dude gets put away and kept away from the general public because  i feel  even if he leaves you alone  he ll just go attach himself to someone else based on some crazy delusions. stay strong be vigilant... god will protect you.
i had a stalker one time and i can say from experience  it sucks.  but it will be over one day and you will be able to move on and play games and live your life!  praying for your situation.
keep the faith  melonie.
stay safe  melonie. hope everything works out for the best.
stay strong melonie. this is a horrible situation to find yourself in. you are a true treasure  and deserve every dollar contributed to help you deal with this horrendous individual. my thoughts and prayers are with you at this terrible time.

stay safe and strong .we re all behind you.
you re a good person. sorry you re going through this. hang in there
i somewhat feel sad for him. like you have to be really messed up in the head to be doing this to someone like you melonie. i hope he gets some help as he really needs some. anyway i hope you can feel safe again and get back to doing what you love. love watching your videos and hate seeing anyone go through stuff like this.
hey melonie stay strong.  thanks for entertaining us  and stay safe.
from what i know this isn t pity or sympathy. this is the community stepping up for one of our own. who like you said did nothing to deserve what happened  which also means you don t deserve to shoulder this alone. keep gaming  keep streaming and keep the hogwarts legacy videos going. be well
you sound adorable with your cold voice. i hope you get better with everything going on. wishing you
it saddens me to see you like this!stay strong and trust the lord  melonie!i will pray for you!

let your lawyer deal with it and lose yourself in your favourite game. you deserve all the support because you re a great person and we all love you
if you need a moment to cry you find a moment to do that melonie  don t let the moment choose you. hope that makes sense. trying to help as someone who was super emotional.

hang in there. if you need support  do not feel bad for asking for it. there are still good people in the world  even when it feels like it falling down around you.
virtual hug   it disturbs me to see that videos like this have to be made... i m just a video game geek  like many others  that likes to watch and listen to your takes on games etc. wishing you well and hoping all this stalker bs gets resolved so you can get back to what you love doing
i was going to say that it seems this guy wants to connect with you in any way  even if the connection is based in negative conflict.  he seems to enjoy affecting your life in any way and having him in your mind.  i think it exhilarates him.
i m so sorry you have to go through this  you will always have the support of us true fans
no one deserves that crap. seriously  stay safe. make sure you have trusted friends around you and chill. have a tea coffee or whatever. remember there s specialists out there for this stuff to. body guards with cyber  eyes   too.this stuff pisses me off.
stay safe  stay armed. praying for you.
i never had someone obsessed with me .  i hope you get this figured out .
hopefully everything will be resolved soon and you can get back to doing what you do. i just recently starting following after the one time i went back on twitter and seeing donut operator retweet something of yours  i was checking who the guests on gutfeld! were going to be then just started looking at tweets from random people companies i follow for some reason. i believe he retweeted a clip of hogwarts legacy showing the name of your character. i haven t watched you play it yet since i have a ps4 so i have to wait until april 4th for hogwarts legacy to come out and i don t want spoilers. . also never blame yourself for these types of things there are disturbing and broken people out there that the world unfortunately has to deal with. i just hope you can solve this issue in the near future and be safe from any stalker or other creeps out there.
melonie  thank you for being such an honest person. you do what makes you most comfortable  obviously. but try not to close yourself off to the support and care from those of us out here in cyber land.  you didn t do anything to deserve the abuse from your stalker. the support and appreciation we share is our gift to you in a time of need. lots of love to you and your family and your close friends.
well thank you for the update get some rest from the sounds of it you got a lot on your mind and you are right you dont deserve this we all want you to be safe hopefully after all of this goes away things will go back to normal
geez  this guy needs to realize what he is doing to you and knock it off. sorry you have to go through this situation. the enemy always comes after those that are bold and share their faith with others. stay strong. praying for peace over you and for safety.
stay strong melonie! we got your back! asking for help is actually a sign of strength and takes a lot of courage. i m going through a stalker situation with a former male friend of mine right now. found out that he lied about the circumstances of stalking two girls i knew personally. cut him off silently by blocking him off all social media and also my phone. i get at least 15-20 unwanted blocked messages on my phone within 3 months. he even tried to contact and message my friends about  how he didn t deserve the blocking and blah blah blah  acting like a victim . so i informed his colleague and boss about his behavior and warned him indirectly that i had backed up screenshots of his messages and that if he didn t stop  i was going straight to the police.
we love you  you dont deserve a psycho creep trying to follow  ill be praying for your safety  3. i hope this situation gets resolved swiftly for you  and this creep gets justice and never does anything like this ever again.
we got ya melonie  ! stay strong  keep your prayer up with thanks to god.
you seem like one of the more genuinely sweet and honest people on youtube.   i hope by some miracle that this guy leaves you alone and gets help for himself. stay safe   sending prayers and good vibes your way!

support from fans is all good.but keep family and trusted friends close. take care of you. stay strong. peace
stay safe hope you can start gaming again soon. the quartering will help you.
issues like this is an indicator that the path you re on is the right path. don t lose your drive. don t let this overwhelm you. christ is on your side. keep doing what you re doing. the community you started is here for you.
stay safe melonie and like you ve said you have given this creep enough attention and time and energy so let the people who you ve paid to worry about him for you. i hate seeing you hurt and please stop saying you don t deserve the support because you re awesome and you definitely deserve it.
i remember when brookeab was discussing this she mentioned almost all female streamers have to deal with this  the majority just dont talk about it publically.maybe something formal needs to be done about it  like a legal counsel help centre  or a lobby group to create laws that actually do sonething about stalkers.
shimada death!you ve got your family there for you and...you ve got an entire fanbase that knows you are an amazing individual!fear not! do not be afraid to ask for help!say the word and...here comes frank horrigan!!!!!
stay strong and you do deserve it  you keep so many people entertained.

sending lots of good thoughts and prayers your way dear lady.  god comfort and shelter you  and lots of love sent your way.i had a stalker years ago  some crazy older lady who decided that i should be her boyfriend.  i know it was agonizing for too long and i hate that you re suffering through it.  know that you ve got a legion of good people who are here with and for you.  live in the joy and focus on the joy and your legions will shout down any losers and lift you up.  god bless you.and kudos to jeremy for being an awesome guy.
try and get some rest. lawsuits are like cancer. they eat your health away. hopefully you will get better over time. the initial start  being served papers  is a dagger in the heart. keep your mind occupied with gaming. my own life was turned upside down dealing with a frivolous 100k lawsuit. stay strong
hey melonie  you have our full support. i most definitely cried though. also don t apologize for wanting help. i genuinely wish i could give money but i can give something in the form of just being here in the form of comments doing my best to provide some form of support like words of encouragement since money doesn t come easy. i hope you feel better soon and god bless you sister. be safe
you deserve the help. stay strong kiddo.
hang in there! this will be a quick speed bump in your life so keep smiling and bask in the warmth that your friends provide you at this hard time. you are amazing!
melonie  the world is full of crazy and the internet may regularly seem like people are the worst versions of themselves on it.but  as you said you didn t ask for any of it.and while people can be nasty online and such. it has a habit of getting behind people when things get real bad.its almost a universal feeling it seems that people don t like stalkers let alone a stalker that has taken such actions against you with such delusions as well.
hey  you actually did earn it and i ll tell you how. by being a good person and putting your heart and mind out there. good people stick together and help each other  right   you love the community and the community clearly loves you. it s also okay to show your emotions  you don t have to say you re sorry like that for showing them. it s nice that you re real and authentic  it lets the community see your heart. don t apologize or feel bad for anything in your heart.
i had an online stalker once  they were a former friend and when i got in a relationship with my current boyfriend who treats me like a queen  this stalker became very obsessed with me and wanted to come to my state to attack me. i luckily chewed him out that i had no feelings for him at all  i m in a loving relationship. and blocked him on everything.  just take care of yourself and take it easy  you are loved
so sorry melonie. i hope your life gets back to normal soon.
i recommend the book  obsession  by the great john e. douglas  the mindhunter dude . i mean  it s from 1998 but the section about stalkers and the ways to safeguard yourself from them remains as valid as ever.
pray melonie and know you are loved for everyone that really cares
melonie  first off  thank you for sharing. keep praying for strength and protection. i will keep praying as well  . just know  you are bloody amazing  you are a light in these dark times  even on you dim days  you still shine bright. you re an inspiration. if you ever need anything  just reach out. god bless you!
can t really add much here to be honest. just  remember that you are loved and you are supported. you ve given so much to the community and it s okay to let them return the favor. i know it s hard but it s okay. i don t share your faith but please hold onto it tightly and it will get you through this. your faith will make you stronger.be well  stay safe and take care of yourself.
you have the support of community  the love of the lord  and i m sure you have a guardian angel protecting you. stalker dude  if youre reading this  come pick on someone your size !
stay strong mel! stay strong and healthy! you gonna get out of this keep your chin up!
stalkers have to be tackled head on  early on. good on you for taking it seriously! i hope this doesn t put you off future encounters with fans. just as i hope it reminds some fans of where the boundaries are.
hope this helps  sorry i can t help in any other way right now. looking forward to your next hogwarts legacy stream.
i m so sorry you re going through this.
there s no shame in needing help or having emotions  especially with the stressful situation you re in. hang in there! from a legal standpoint  you have a lot more in your favor than that creep does.
3 good luck melanie  can t wait to see some real world consequences for that a-hole stalker. sending you spirit energy prayers for your goku spirit bomb.
seeing you like this is heartbreaking. i wish you the very best.
i just want you to be happy  safe  and healthy. i wish people would just leave you alone. funny story. the first time i heard about you someone retweeted a video of you eating a stick of kerrygold. i thought it was hilarious. i want to see you doing more of that being goofy than being stressed out. i hope they get that guy and you can finally put all of this behind you.
melonie  we re here because we love seeing you play games  talk games  and calling out the bs... we are humbled to have you as a voice for us all  and we take care of our own. all day  every day. we got your 6.
we just wanted to play video games. a meme that will remain evergreen.you ve got this.
same
you ll be okay we all got your back!
keeping you in our prayers. an  youre correct a lunatic for no reason at all. hope this comes out awsome and getting back the new videos. im sorry melonie what a horrible situtation . no person deserves all this bs. do your thing
we got your back!!  stay strong!!
your a warm and genuine person with a beautiful glow... which unfortunatley goblins and trolls will be attracted to!!! the world is full of creeps and nutters... youll get through this and be stronger for it
i m sorry about your situation. hope you solve this soon
melonie  you re a really good person  and personally i would have brutally broken this stalker in any ways that i know would have been very painful  because when i see you  it triggers the same protector instinct that i would have for my own family. especially when you remind me of my cousin bria or my girlfriend patricia that are public figures themselves.i only implore people to not tell me to  not be violent   which if i know myself very well  if i am going to inflict violence  it s going to be protecting my loved ones and people that are in a tough position to protect themselves. i am not saying it for some vapid bravado  because if someone hurt my girlfriend that is a public figure in front of me or anyone in my family i would not wish to use violence  but if i did  i only hope that seen protecting her.
keep your head up melonie. hopefully this will pass soon and you can use it as a growing experience.
i ve never seen you before the previous video i commented on  but what you said  i feel like this community has done a lot of good for me and for others   the  for others  is why you have earned what you ve recieved through the funding... every innocent person deserves to be heard without worrying about finances  regardless of  earning  it  or not.. but judging by the comments and the support you ve recieved  it s pretty clear you ve earned it even if you don t see it. i enjoy watching a stream every now and then  but for some people it s a lot more than that  you may not realize what your videos and the community you ve created does and means to certain people... it could be for that short amount of times it makes them smile and forget their own issues  whatever those issues are  that s a powerful and positive thing. i m sure they couldn t put a price on that..
blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted. you are a beautiful human being  you will get through the nonsense and get back to the things you are meant to do
hang in there melonie. we got your back!!!
oh man this kills me. get some rest melonie. god will get you through this
screw stalkers...do they not know that hair is mine!  mine i say!  seriously though i m sure you ll work through this.  and far as far as community help... you seem like a nice enough young lady and it s sort of one of the few wholesome things the internet does.
do not ever let anybody anywhere live rent free and that beautiful mind of yours! do not let them steal your joy! get a team together and pull out a big can of whoop ass to throw at that stalker! be strong young lady!
we are with you. be well
please don t be discouraged. you are being attacked right now. continue to fill yourself with prayer and take all those steps necessary to protect yourself. it is unfair that you have to do this  but it is the cost of you fighting the good fight in a horrible world that is crumbling around us all. please stay strong.
hey melonie i hope everything works out for you in this situation  and you re able to continue doing the stuff you enjoy here soon. i ve been recently enjoying your content and would hate to see it interrupted or stopped  that definitely make me unhappy. i hope this idiot doesn t succeed in whatever he s trying to accomplish and get from you. you are in my prayers melonie
feel better  kid!
you don t have to do anything to deserve it. you just do.
melonie  you did nothing wrong! you have every right to live a healthy and safe life. i m glad you have a lawyer  as a mental health therapist  it s important you get legal support.i respect your thoughts on the challenge of receiving support  i empathize. i would like to challenge you you do deserve the support  you enrich our life by celebrating  nerd  culture  including your thoughts and insight. i wish the very best to you  your family  friends and fans who are there to support you. this video was challenging to watch as i  unfortunately  have seen similar issues all too often in my field of work. you re awesome  take care!
crappy situation  hope things end up working out for you in your favor ofcourse  and just keep on doing what youre doing dont let that guy have you second guessing.
i know you probably don t want to hear this  but don t delete this video. as embarrassing as it may seem  people need to see how this is affecting you and how it can affect even the strongest of people. some may mock you for shedding tears  but you have an army of supporters to drown out the haters. know you have people that ll drop everything to help out so you can always ask someone. stay strong and stay safe.
keep on playing and reviewing games  have a great time at the range s   and generally have fun and be safe out there.  hopefully your counter suits will keep this individual away.
sorry to hear about what you re going through at the moment. you don t deserve it. positive vibes from canada.
the video is not embarrassing so no need to delete it on that account. its a real situation and thanks for the update. hope you get to enjoy some gaming soon.
you re awesome girl. i ll keep you in my prayers but you re in good hands.  god loves you and so do we   read your favorite scriptures or devotionals and you ll feel so much better.
i think it s a great idea to do these videos to document the impact he is having on your mental health and your income. even a substandard lawyer can get you the restraining order with plenty of proof along these lines.
it s ok to get that thing out of your chest  so don t worry about thinking embarrassing yourself by creating this  quite the opposite  it makes you more human and real  which nowadays a lot of people lack. take care and keep doing what you do.
take care melonie  be safe and make sure this man gets put away. its easy to see the fear that he is instilling on you even through this video. dont settle with this guy and dont feel sorry for him  he deserves no pity here.
just wanna say i m in your corner and praying for you.  you re a strong person you ll get through this
it s gonna be alright  sister. you ll get through.
sending banjo kazooie hugs your way. stay strong! god is guiding things in the right direction so that justice will be served to this weirdo.
you stay awesome mac. we got your back
we are all behind ya 100  melonie. take a big chillaxing breather and take that much needed time to recoup. this for the most part is an invasion of self  no one deserves to be subject to that. keep your head high  things will get better.
prayers coming your way
well melonie since you re having a hard time i ll share this with you and hopefully it will cheer you up.roughly a month ago i was contemplating putting a bullet in my head. your channel and followers and your sharing of faith especially in your discord  even though i m just a lurker  helped me realize that i needed to seek help. i have been on medications for a little over a month and feel like a totally new person. i realized i had never actually felt happiness in my life until now. sure i had felt joy before when i accomplished something but  i don t remember ever feeling that contentness with life that i would describe as happy. i just hope you understand how big and impact you and your community can really have in a positive way on someone else.
stay strong  it s not disgraceful to ask for help
you deserve it. you are a great person
just take care of yourself don t worry about the rest. this is not on you just on some sicko that doesn t know boundaries and just being a normal decent human. your health and safety is first we ll be here.
you re doing great  in my prayers
that must be one f cked up cold. just playin! hope you feel better soon  this stuff really sucks  my sister had a creeper and i will never forget how much it bothered her. keep in mind that this too shall pass and one day it will simply be a distant memory.
mac - i don t think you realize that the stuff you do and are doing is a force for good. and you deserve the backing of a lot of us for being a force for good. hang in there  stay strong  and know that we support you.
hope you feel better  up the vitamin c and d and sleep well. prayers and blessings for you.
it doesn t need to be announced publicly as a show of force  but i sure hope the other youtube content creators you ve associated yourself with on fnt over the last 12 mths do what they can to financially help you behind the scenes with any rising legal costs. the quartering did a good solid for you in the last few days with the fundraiser page and that s great to see. you are a valued member of the social media community  so people now need to chuck some bills your way if they haven t already and have ya back on what s quite frankly a disgusting situation with this stalker creep. go boom
melonie you have nothing to be feel embarrassed about. i knew the gaming community was supportive but. i just didn t know how much until. i joined twitch   discord  i think i can speak for everyone when i say that. we all have your back!   now i haven t followed you on youtube as long as some people on here  but i can see why people enjoy watching you. you bring love   energy to the room!  i am so very sorry that you are going through this. in the end though you will prevail  i ill keep you in my thoughts   prayers.  3
melonie god is on your side and hope this gets resolved and you can get back to what makes you happy! god bless you!
you will get through this you have lots of love   support. if i was your man i will treat you like  goddesss. 3
hope you are safe
lots of strength and encouragement from europe!
also try and get in touch with rekieta. i m sure he ll be happy to give you some legal advice and connect you with the right people in terms of lawyers etc. really sorry to hear this is happening to you. stay safep.s. leave melonie aloooooooone!  famous britney fan video   may it make you chuckle a bit
mel  please chill out!! we all can see how big of a burden this is for you... in cases like that i miss good old days when such stuff was handled by good old s w... it probably won t help much  but i want you to know that there are ppl in poland that wish you for all of this to end as fast as it s possible! i also hope there s some ballance in the universe and some transformer will have some fun with that weirdo  that s messing with you. please stay strong!
there are tons of great people in this world. i found this out when i was in a motorcycle accident recently. protect yourself from the evil. i think i speak for many when i say i love what you do so please keep doing it.
hang tough  you have people who have your back
here s for the hope for better days in the future  this situation shouldn t happen to anyone  but unfortunately there are some people out there that need help and needlessly focus that unhealthy mindset on others. i hope this is spent on some good times out with close friends.
hope things go back to normal for you soon still glad i clicked your video after seeing the     tattoo. keep doing what you love and try to once this blows over not let it get to you.
stay tough  hufflepuff
be well melonie
you deserve the support because your a wonderful person. just accept it. now lets go play some hogwarts!
it s not pity. we just got your back. it s homies helping out homies. you got a stalker sure but you also got all of us here to make sure you good. it ll be ok. i look forward to your hogwarts playthorugh. i never use twitch so ill try and catch the vods. shawty! you da best. you da you da best.
standing with melonie
keep doing your thing don t let stuff slow you down  there s always ups and downs so stay positive. if you have to go ghost alil then do it. we are here for ya if need.  clearly the dude needs his ass whoop instead  and his going to end up messing with the wrong group. focus on your self screw everything else
wish you the best  stay strong.
you ve done a lot  more than you know. personally  you ve restored my faith in the fact that not all women are insane in this insane world.i have no money to give you  but i do have a prayer i can send you way. stay strong. you will be okay.
matthew 11  28.  still in my prayers  hopefully you ll find some rest from this.i remember what a woman at walmart old me once   don t let it steal your joy .  i forget the situation  i remember going into walmart in a slightly bad mood  but that simple comment stuck with me for some reason.  i don t know from experience what this is like  not specifically this anyway  but i m praying it won t take away your joy for what you do.psalm 139  14.  take care melonie!!!
if you love tea have some tea. just relax as much as you can. i know it s not the easiest time. little things that help you feel safe in your house will help you heal through this.
you should stream stalker
it s going to be ok .god is handling it .
i ve had to deal with a psychopath before and it puts you on edge. usually these people eventually fall victim to their own derangement. in the meantime do whatever you have to do to protect and defend yourself.
you ve helped me with my mental state  faith  and all that good stuff and i m sure i m not the only one so in my opinion you do deserve all the support your getting i m not saying you shouldn t give the money back that you don  use for the lawyer bills but if you didn t i wouldn t judge you for it and it s not a bad place to put that money  you  because you obviously have a good impact on people
not sure what florida laws are but where i live  you can push for the other party to pay for court costs if you win the case.you are a class act. praying for you.
keep the faith melonie  the lord wants us to depend on him  he will always be there for us in the darkest times but it s our darkest times when he s calling us to call on him. he is our shepard and we are his flock.
my girlfriend is blind and she has alot of ptsd from a stalker that comes and goes with stress. it sucks bc the legal system doesn t punish stalking anywhere near what it should  but just stay safe and always let ppl know where you re going. eventually the guy will find someone else to latch onto and you ll be free of the situation.
as a new subscriber to your channel  i m deeply saddened by this. you don t deserve this. may the full armor of god protect you and comfort you.
praying for you melonie these men really need to face jail. i m dealing with problematic ones myself. we really need to redo worldwide stalking laws. it s been years since the death of rebecca schaefer  when do we finally make women feel safe
got your back sister. stay strong.
that voice!!!  the fact that the subject is so serious and yet the voice is so funny make this video so good!!! i wish i could give this video more than one
you don t owe us an explanation  just stay safe  stay smart   do not let him have power over you.
we ve got your back always mel.
what you did to deserve the donations was talking about what s happening.  takes courage to open up about fear
dang...i got choked up a little. it sux when bad things happen to good people.
stay safe and hang in there  mel.  soon this mess will be in the rear view mirror  and we can get back to just playing video games.
so sorry you are going through this because of a total looser..... praying for you. god bless
you got this. stay awesome
the force will be with you  always.
if you need to make announcements i would suggest you do it through a friend who has a platform like maybe jeremy every time you show up on video you might be encouraging him
we love you melonie. we re behind you.
we got your back girly. just let us know what you need
lean on your loved ones and your nerd community. sometimes we all need a solid rock to lean against.
stay strong  don t cry. hold ur head high and know that u are better than those psychos. they are psychos for a reason  knowing this all we can do is feel bad for their sorry asses. we are better than them anyways and they know it.
praying for you young blood
it s better to ask for help than to isolate yourself and deal with it alone. you don t deserve this and i m glad your getting the support you need. i hope they put this creep away. god bless.
melonie  you have my sword! any support you need  just ask. hang in there!
found your channel through hogwarts  looking forward to you getting back into what you enjoy. you can add me to any support you need.
i can t believe people like that exist. sweet anita has been dealing with this as well. i hope you re okey.
please stay safe  melonie
you re great and awesome as you are! satan uses people who agree to take others down and pause their lives  but god is greater and undefeated. despite this happening melonie  you re still showing how very admirable and strong you are in these situations. great job and we have your back!
i m so sorry that you have to deal with all this.
you re a good person that lifts other people spiritually and emotionally  people wanting to help you is an organic response. you don t have to feel bad about people wanting to support help you in any way  even financially.also i m sure jeremy and others have said this but you don t have to use kid-gloves when dealing with something like this. file a restraining order  don t worry about harming someone you re defending yourself from . and maybe you need to stay with family or have family member or close friend stay with you for a little while. the guy sounds genuinely emotionally ill and his behavior won t follow any kind of rationale you can understand. expect anything to be possible  prepare accordingly and do not even entertain the thought for a second that anything you did invited or provoked this. the rain falls on the righteous and the wicked alike.
don t be embarrassed. this isn t your fault. we are with you all the way.
keep the good fight going  melonie. you ve got more support than you know. no shame in showing emotions or asking for help.
i wish i could do more than provide moral support. you have it.
we know this is something that you didnt want any of this happening.  i dont know you personally. i enjoy the entertainment you provide. i dont want anything to happen to you. this dude is crazy and causing you personal damage.  emotionally and financially. im sure alot of fans feel the same as i do. if you need to raise more money for legal fees  we  your fans will be here to help anyway we can. stay safe and stay strong .  don t ever feel like this is your fault. much
chin up  girl.  things will get better.  keep fighting the good fight.
melonie place stay safe  but please take a breather relax a little take care of what you need to. we will be waiting for you don t worry. you know the people have your back. you don t need to prove anything to anyone. sending you a virtual
god is with you. this is him showing you that we truly care  and want the best ending to this utter shit show. remember your strength  we are with you  god is with you.
i want this to go away as soon as possible for you. you deserve to just play your games and keep us entertained. i wish nothing but the best for you.
stay strong  dear!!!hugs sentall will be well
be sure to take it easy! the stress has to be excruciating. be sure to take care of you!
sad to see this... these stalkers are out of control... and should be punished and removed from everyone... thats the way to deal with them... so they cant hurt anyone.
first  get yourself some sleep  because it sounds like you need it. then start streaming til you start to get bored. nothing but love and positivity coming your way.
if he is for you  who can be against you. keeping you in my prayers
praying for you.
hang in there  melonie!
you ll come out off this stronger than ever  it s a crazy world with some crazy people in it but your a shinning light in it  now play them games and have the best time doing it.
its good you got the courage to ask for help  better then staying quiet. don t apologize about it  you got this! now play some fun games mel!!
it s just disgusting how a single person can t handle rejection and move on.
get well soon  and stay safe.
if a million ppl give you a dollar  its just a dollar to them but its a million dollars to you. ppl coming together to help a cause is a great thing. dont feel bad  feel blessed and be gracious.
keep strong!! bad people wont stop coming  we have to keep up!
thank you so much
just do what you need to do to get rid of this creep   rally your family around yourself get sorted with the lawyers and throw the cops at the jerk. stay safe ms mac.
well there is one good thing to come of all this sweety  look at all the support you have from your followers. the comment section shows just how much we got your back by sending our love  prayers and well wishes. take care  god bless and i hope you feel better soon! drink some hot green tea  get some rest and try not to stress. much love!
dude. rough to watch. take your time. we re routing for ya.
it sucks that you have to deal with this kind of shit.  hang in there.  i like your videos
w got you mel don t worry. god bless you just another one of lifes challenges.
keep strong melonie as the old saying goes don t let the bastards grind you down you re a champ and remember that guys behaviour is weakness you staying strong and living your life is strength wish you the best
as a father i get so mad hearing about shit like this it really sucks to know that shitty men are out there preying on our daughters really hope your situation improves  go off grid for awhile and get some rest
i hope you get better very very soon and get some sleep.  i hope he leaves you alone.
hi meloni  it hurt me really bad hearing you like this  it is horrible that women in the world have to live situations like the one you are living  i think about the women in my family and i feel really really sorry for you  it is not just and fare  you are a great girl  i am crying  and i feel impotent that i cant help you. damn that guy  i am not a violent person but i wish that i have this guy in front of me and tell him... i am with you meloni  and i really hope that this thing will be over soon. i send you a big big big hug!!!!
you don t want extra but people will give to help you out cause you help them out everyday and make there days better with your videos and you make them feel like they aren t crazy when they don t or won t think or say or feel how the woke cult ideology people do. you say you haven t done anything but the reality is the total opposite. you feel you haven t done anything cause ur just being you and speaking ur mind and enjoying what you do but in doing that you are helping people and brightening there days and entertaining them.
melonie. we got your back.  we all just wish to help.  use the money to help with the lawyer fees and build up your security. that s all we want.   happily donated just to see you safe.
we re with you  melonie!
aww god mel i hope you get threw this fast and be at peace! this is so fucked up and needs to end now!  i m a friend if need to talk be safe!
we love ya melonie keep your spirits up
omfg this guy doesn t stop. i think you might have to file for something more than a restraining order. i think the best thing to do is not to give him any attention at all
stay strong melonie!
hi melonie how s it going  hey always have faith and stay positive . i m with you all the way. keep your head up and never give up. love you always
you got this. and we got you.
we will fight him together! you have so many communities that have been talking about it.
stay strong  dear. god s got your back
thank you dan!
this whole situation isn t fair to you. you don t deserve to have this person make you feel like this. stay strong and keep doing what makes you happy.
hi....hope you get the help . i ve been only watching your channel for 2 weeks now. i enjoy watching you talk about gaming. hold your head up high and smile. no one deserves what your going through. hope to see you soon back on track of gaming.
keep your head up. this storm will pass.
jeremy from the quartering sent me. prayers for peace of mind and safety.
awe. that first bit of the vid made me wanna hug you. i hope you re ok.
not going to cry  catching a cold  then cries. it s ok to be emotional.. play some games! you need the break. sending good vibes!
when i had difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep  taking 5-10 mg of melatonin before bedtime helped me sleep better. i also cut out caffeine 6 hrs before trying to sleep  and gave myself an hour buffer between bed time and video displays of any kind. unless it s some kind of physical pain keeping me awake  it has usually been the noise between my ears causing it
you got me as a subscriber to help you out against the darkest of internet freaks. stay strong.
no one pities you  we all support you. two different things  dude.
i hope things can go back to normal for you asap and this stalker can stay out of your life.
take a few days off  play some games and rest up  we will miss your videos but i think most of us care more about your health and sanity. take care of yourself  you say you don t know hat you did to deserve our support but some of us come home from work and look forward to popping you up on the screen for some nerdiness. if you can t ask for help  at least accept it when offered in good faith.
wish you the best. i cannot stand stalkers  especially when it comes to a man stalking a woman. you ll might need protection.
stay strong . be safe . god bless you
come  melonie  rest for a bit  see that you fight off the cold that besets you before getting back at everyone. it would be the wise thing to do  getting out of the weakened position quickly.and what s that rubbish about not deserving all the support ! -- god begs to differ  it seems.  cheers  girl.
hang in there  melanie! as officer tatum likes to say  god s got your six.
i m sorry you re going through all this bullshit. you re awesome and don t deserve this psycho bringing all this chaos into your life. i ll be praying for you.
shout out to josiah for subscribing. hang in there  and most importantly  do not give these shyte bird stalkers the infamy they crave. if you re also living in a city that doesn t enforce nonsensical gun control  go out and buy yourself one and get trained! caution over error! good luck.
you got our support! 100 to the stalker  cause we know you are reading these comments. leave melanie alone and seek help!
melonie  glad to hear you have the local leo s involved. being a long career    retired deputy sheriff  i have worked many a case such as yours. i thought of my daughter and would want her to do the same as in this day and age it s a very unpredictable world and not in a good way.  i am also glad you have a relationship with our lord   savior jesus christ  who will ultimately protect you when all is said and done. if you need any advice or tips of safety  i would be glad to help you out.be safe and watch your six   your surroundings..ha  yours in christ ray
jeremy is good people  praying for you
looking forward things getting back to normal  none of us want to see you upset. i really hope he just drops the whole thing and leaves you alone but if not you have so much more support then he ever will and he will just ended loosing all his money if he even has any.
it s ok melony! you are washed in the blood of the lamb! nothing can touch you!
keep your head up melonie mac! you will win this!
if i learned anything from watching rekieta  it s that lawyer fees always end up more than you expect. if you have anything left over after all this  maybe donate it to some anti-stalking organization or something.
the world is full of creeps  unfortunately.  stay safe
love you melonie sending you lots of love
stay strong  you are a great woman. i m sorry you have to deal with all that  guy is a serious creeper.
big love to you   everything will get better   fuck this guy we have your back
melonie you do deserve it. you put yourself out there almost everyday on yt  as well as twitch and discord. speaking out about nerd culture alone does a lot  to know that you  and so many people out there are seeing what is happening to the ips we love are thinking and saying the same things let s people know they re not alone or crazy. i m not a christian  but when you used to do the verse of the day you consistently put out a very positive  assertive and personally responsible perspective on christianity that i deeply respect. no doubt that in the christian portions of your discord you reach out to and touch so many people. this is why myself and so many other people have stepped up to give you a hand  you do not deserve what that person is trying to do to you  and we want you to be safe and happy. you are not alone. may the force be with you.
2 17 and 3 38  anyone in the comments feel that way before  that s how the saving grace of god feels!! you didn t earn and don t deserve it  but it s the free gift from god through his son  jesus!praying for melonie to get through this and get to a place where she feels safe!! this is an awful situation and i m so sorry you re dealing with this!! stay strong!!
if we can t help our fellow member in the gaming community then we deserve to get high jacked by them. must look out for melanie  she speaks for us all.
i hope you get to play some video games soon. stay safe!
i want someday to hear how this all started  when she s ready . i also want a system set up by yt where us posters chatters  members w youtube accts  can be rated by other yt chatters in real time- but only the host of a live chanel can see it. use it  when a live show is on  to ban someone with an extremely low rating  where those with high or very high ratings can be invited to personaized streams  to everyone feels safe.
even your voice sounds tired. hang in there  melonie! praying for you.
start a foundation to support others in similar situations if you end up with more than what you need
i had a couple of stalkers when i was in high school.  it was two separate occasions  and even as a fairly large guy who was being stalked by girls  it was absolutely no fun.  i didn t want harm to come to either of them  but they wouldn t stop  and i didn t know how to get them to.  i had no idea who to turn to  because a lot of people laughed it off.  i didn t think it was friggin funny in the least that they knew where i lived  would skip class to stare at me through classroom doors  and would slip things in my locker like weird poetry and art  or try to touch me in passing.  it was awful.it was an unfortunate time for me because i never got any romantic female attention other than this in high school.  it s hard to respond to someone you don t know who tells you they re in love with you.  it was uncomfortable at best and downright unsettling at worst.  i couldn t imagine how much worse it would be if our genders had been reversed  and i was the girl in the situation.i m sorry this guy is doing this  melonie.  he s obviously delusional  and it is not your fault.  you have every right to be upset  and you have every right to do what you need to defend yourself.  i truly wish you the best.
you can do it! make some nerdy content! we got your back!
be careful out there mel!
mel don t be sorry for excepting support from people who want to support you.we got you your back just like we would support anyone else in this community.
if i may i understand  this situation  is frustrating  and places a heavy toll  but do not let a predator know that he has affected you. he has no remorse in his heart and any control  attention you give him will be like  a reward to his twisted heart he can t  have you so he s attacking  you for  attention  and relevancy in your  life even if it s  negative. give him no quarter. this will eventually pass but in the meantime  stay strong  and endure.god bless you.
the verses of the day got me to start reading my bible again. she s had such a positive influence on so many.
who is jeremy  is that the quartering also mel  do what you gotta do! if that means sleeping and skipping a stream  or talking about this stuff on stream rather than trying to pretend  people are going to be more than fine with that.you ll find your feet soon  it s natural this affects you cause it s been intense...hope this weirdo finally gets the message and leaves you alone.
continue to protect yourself  and be safe.
this might get buried and lost in all the comments and support. remember to drink water.and maybe some orange juice also. please get some rest when you can. we will still be here.stay safe. take care. have fun.
chin up melthe entire gaming community s got your back and beyondcoz in situations like this we all go boom!
mel please take one day at a time.  with the lawyer and your family this junk will end.
we support you mel
part of adult life is dealing with shit we don t want to deal with.  it sucks  but that s life. can t bargain your way out of it.  the good news is that once you confront the problem instead of wishing it would just go away   you will start to feel like you re taking control and facing the fear  which will massively boost morale. shift gear.  when you re going through hell   keep going.
you should probably record your videos live from now on  just in case things get worse  hopefully not  but at least you ll have evidence and witnesses in case this creep tries to something stupid while your at home doing your youtube stuff. also  you should have someone you trust with you until this is over  just to be safe. take care and god bless you.
if you got some left over you could always give it to charity. that way some good could come from this mess.
girl  i think you could use a hug  something to eat  and a nice vacation on a beach somewhere.
get some sleep.  take care of yourself.  there are lots of people praying for you.
i am praying for you everyday.
please know good people out number the bad.  this weirdo can go rot in hell.  love and support you....will be keeping you in my prayers.  please stay strong....we love and care about you here in the wacky web world.  virtual hug sent.
unfortunately the world is full of crazies  if you can you should totally ignore him in your videos  because attention is what people like him crave. also i wouldn t worry if your crowdfunding going over you can always donate the excess to either a church or women shelter something like that  keep making the great videos  good luck and i will pray for you and your safety.
virtual hug for you melonie.
s okay  melonie. everybody needs help now and again  no shame in that.
it s crazy someone can just take you to court and put you in a position to have to pay a bunch of money to avoid punishment for something you have no business being put through in the first place. wtf
so stressful. do your best just to take it easy.
you ll be fine just be aware of what is going on around you in your surroundings.  not paying attention to details will get your battle buddy killed in combat. lol army training  sir!
my heart goes out to you melanie. i promise you  you ve got nothing to fear from this clown. i would actually counter sue him. i bet you destroy him then
blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because  having stood the test  that person will receive the crown of life that the lord has promised to those who love him.  james 1 12stay strong  melonie! we all got your back  and  more importantly  god has your back too - don t be afraid or ashamed to lean on us and on him when you need to most!
you re be fine melonie you are a strong person
hey  melanie. might be a random nobody just watching your videos as a method of support  but you don t need to be embarrassed  we got your back. think of us as your big brother sister if it helps. normal isn t fun  even if it might be safe. then again i wouldn t be watching your videos if you were normal  thank you for all you do.
keep your chin up! hope you can play some hogwarts soon it s really enjoyable!
hopefully you will get this behind you soon
it s a massive shame all this is happening. it s horrible seeing someone cry because of harassment  bullying and stalking.  it is unfortunate also that the person advising you about your go fund me is someone that also caused issues for a female content creator which resulted in her putting out a video crying and then ridiculed and bullied her for it. so either he is being very hypocritical or he has turned a new leaf   i really hope it is the latter. and the help he is giving to you is nothing but productive
we got your back  mel!
i m glad you are safe i really hope you are doing well and ok may you have a wonderful day today
remember melonie   no weapon formed against you shall prosper.
stay strong young lady.
get some rest melonie and don t let w e he  wants  attention or w e it s bother what you need to do for your wellbeing and overall life beautiful little lady.  these videos are not for him at all but for you and your community.
gosh i wanna hug you so much melonie. so sorry this is happening to you. you don t deserve this nonsense. we re here for you melonie. we love you so much uwu
i think the point is no one deserves to be stalked which means everybody deserves to not be stalked. which means you do deserve it.  alitaarmy
best wishes there  mel.   i m sure you didn t do anything to provoke it  and you most definitely don t deserve to go through this crap.  nobody does.things will work out with time  and you ll get back to just doing your regular thing.   hang in there.   it s gonna be alright.take care in the meantime.
maybe you should have someone you check in with everyday for a bit until this thing ends for good. that way they know something is wrong if they don t hear from you. i sound alarmist i know but in a world where 6 3 men can pretend to be women it s not all that crazy. stay safe melonie!
you know what your fans have our eyes on him on lock down. so you shouldn t worry to much. you seem to have a strong fan base from what i see. i m not no fan just yet because i m fairly new to your channel. hoping to see more time raider content. by the way there should be a gofund me for a classic tomb raider.
holy shit batman i just heard that billy eilish is also being stalk. what s wrong with these guys   it s very heart warming to see how people that follow you really care.
the funny thing is i would guess that everyone of us who watchs your videso would love to help any way they can. we are after the  evil  gamergate side of that we are the  evil  ones who are willing to help out the ones we like and support them anyway we can.
i ll bet your pops is a ball of fuming anger about this. i can see him cleaning his shotgun and picking out just the right shovel at home depot. don t mess with mac daddy and our strawberry shortcake! hang in there lil sis  we got your back.
you do good shows and i hope noting but the best for you so keep up the good videos and thank you.
you don t deserve it at all  it s some weirdo s delusional mind. if he actually cared about you he d stop. hopefully this situation gets handled and he is forced to stop. keep your head up  you have support from the fanbase  wish i could be more helpful. stay safe.
it is ok to ask for help. you didn t do anything to deserve all of this crap that is happening. don t let anyone steal your joy. we all care about you.
homie the real nerd culture is going to always have your back!!!!! keep doing the awesome vids and being you homie!!!!!
christ  i came down with schizophrenia at age 42  and even i never did crap like this. there was nothing minor about the delusions and such that i had  either. hope you get through this and get some peace back in your life.
you sound exhausted with this bs mel  i hope you get through it as fast as possible. but fyi  you have 100  earned all the support you re getting.
you should  look up a nearby biker group and tell them your situation.  they ll handle it
any extra money you get from the fund drive you can just give to charity. just keep your family and friends close.
don t let these shitheads get you down. you have a gang of people that have your back!
i m so sorry this is happening.  that freak needs to just move on and mind his own business.  but he s a sick loser.  we ve got your back  melonie!
stay strong melonie
take a few deep breaths  and stay centered on god. people will even understand if you want to take a break for a while!the most important thing is to take care of yourself  and keep your chin up. whatever it takes!we ve got your back!much love   best wishes
you did nothing to deserve this guy. he s at fault. i m sorry you have to deal with this. you seem like a genuinely nice person. you got this  and we got your back.
i had a cyberstalker who was from out of country who had repetitively messaged me throughout the years years ago and sometime after that a supposed  friend even message me quite a few years later basically saying that i should feel sorry for ignoring her and then after that i just let them the friend  go on a tangent about whatever and after that i m not sure what happened them but the main person attempted to renter my good books on other accounts but i still pretty much blocked them at every possible turn. and i thankfully hadn t seen anything else about them and account s wise nothing was acting unusual and not to mention i was hoping they didn t have any inside my country to their relatives and again thankfully it never went that far.  and i m sometimes in a ton of stores sometimes. that s in a nutshell what happened with me and i m not famous in the slightest i had a youtube channel but it got partially hacked.
sadly a snake will show up in the tall grass  atleast you re aware of this snake  sending prayers to you
i m not crying while continues to cry lol  hope you stay safe
well saying you re confessing your love to a personality over the internet and being 100  real about it with no chance of it working out to being with  when you know that person just wants to stream and talk about video games. i can see where that comes off that way  especially when he s 50 years old and you re way out of his league. just being real and know that s not what it s really all about.
mel don t stop praying
stay strong.....stay aware
good luck  melonie. don t let him upset you. stay calm and just let your legal people handle it. stay safe.
people like this can be very dangerous.  you need some sort of restraining no contact order on him and if he gets near you blast him.
nobody deserves anything. you earned the support of your fans by being a decent person  standing your ground when it matters  and providing entertainment that people value. you earned jeremy s support through the connections you made. he earned his fans  trust by being a decent and genuine  though flawed  human being. and everyone who donated felt good about it. you re right  you don t deserve anything. but you earned this.
awesome sweater. very vintage! i recently found some old sew   cut ornaments from ss. things were so different back then...
no  melonie...you didn t do anything to deserve this......and by that i mean  having a stalker turn your life upside down.   you know as well as anyone what grace is all about. it s unbidden  and it s undeserved  sure  but it s still love and support. the fact that you are thankful for all of the support is satisfaction enough to everyone who has donated to the cause.
you don t deserve it! i m praying for you i m so sorry your dealing with this jerk!
hope you get well soon  drink lots of water. keep warm
if you read this.. please ensure you reopen givesendgo if the legal expenses aren t covered.. and i think i probably speak for most all donators when i say you should also feel free to spend that money on related items like.. restraining order costs  security cameras for where you live.. maybe a glock and a holster.. whatever you need to keep you safe
hey mel just wanted to say i hope you don t think all older dudes are creepy  i am an older dude who watches and enjoys your channel and just wanna say it sucks that you have to through this but the vast majority of men who older are not like that guy. keep your chin up and just do you  f that weirdo and keep the content coming. doods like that give us all a bad name!
strawberry shortcake!  nice!  don t worry  this guy will get gone. stay strong.
sorry to see you upset. i think people who see a normal girl who is confident and broadcasts on social media and such  think they know that person.  they think they can cross boundaries and upset your life balance. i hope you have a lovely day and i respect your honesty and sincerity. all the best  paul.
you think maybe a day at the spa might help  once this all sorts itself out  and it will sort itself out.
i only recently subscribed to your channel  due to a you-tube collaboration you were in. its sad that this stalker is happening to you. but it looks like you have many fans that will support you through it.
this is mental! have you some friends or siblings who can stay with you untill this guy is sorted out  mac
hope ur okay melonie!!!!
you can always donate what s left over. no-one who gave will have a problem with that.
be safe lock your doors get a dog. keep the fire with you at all times.
i never doubted it  but i wanted to form an objective opinion so i looked dude up... yeah he s fully off his rocker. i didn t comment on his stuff because it seems like he s really looking for the attention. sorry you re dealing with that. protect yourself  but don t let him have another second of your energy whenever you can help it... this too shall pass. you ve earned  and deserve the support you re receiving. stay safe  and god bless.
you didn t do anything wrong. we got your back. god has your back. you re going to be okay.
people have your back melanie always know that
hugs  prayers and love for you melonie!   god will get you through this.don t worry about anything  instead  pray about everything. tell god what you need  and thank him for all he has done. then you will experience god s peace  which exceeds anything we can understand. his peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in christ jesus.philippians 4 6 - 7
sorry you have to deal with any of this. hang in there.
no worries  i definitely don t think that. my dad is an amazing man and many other older men who i ve seen in the community  like yourself. god bless you
so im having a really hard time prioritizing spells for my hotkeys on hogwarts legacy. and i swear every character has independently operating eyeballs.
as a fellow christian who loves the same stuff i will pray for you to have this situation resolved so you can get back to your life
this world is so annoying man. u will get thru this
i m so sorry you re going through all this.  hang in there  you re going to come out on the other side.
maybe talk to your attorney about suing that creep for your legal costs. hopefully this is all resolved soon.
i think that this guy won t go away if you only play defense  file a complaint for criminal harassment and he might end up behind bars.
we love you melonie! we ve got your back!! if i have to bring a team of combat vets down for protection  we re down!
stay safe and stay strong!
keep your head up.
just hang in there. it ll be over with before you know it.
i went through that dropbox stuff yesterday after the vid and wow  what a lunatic! that was like a quiver of red-flag arrows! first of all i do feel that the timing of valentines day for the process service was intentional and the whole thing is  100 to disarm you..b c theres no other reason  as youre obvi not doing anything agg to him.prayin for you and everyone who looked at the receipts   had to allow that guys insane ranting to invade their brain space...the 12 sec vid where he said  ..shes been nasty to me when all ive done is make her laugh..  bruh! when!   china and america messed this up  so maybe someone was trying to make it up to me... by how bro!   magically making her appear in your ig feed  which btw is not her  falling into your lap ... just one asinine nonsense statement of insane logic after the next..sorry that youre dealing with this..the best thing is that all the eyeballs on this guy now..thank god you have all the support! great to hear.
stalkers are  by nature  cowards and narcissists. they believe they have a right to someone  but they aren t capable of accepting that they are not desired by the ones they  themselves  desire to possess.
praying for you
god protect this women
you re so cool. stay safe love
god is in control! you got this!
we stand with melonie mac!!
prayers for you
at this point i would say to call his employer and take this to court since he hasn t got the clue.there comes a point where you need to do something when someone doesn t get the clue.
melonie  what you need until this situation simmers down is a big dog or a couple big guy friends to stay over. it is obvious every little sound you hear is giving you the heebie jeebies.
wholesome
ayjo and get well soon
the strawberry shortcake saga is getting deep
yo have your dad  or if you have a brother  stay with you for a month for safety. or just get another fund me for like half a year of security.
a good dog and a good . those are good things. no  they re great things. family is another great thing. those are things that really help one feel secure and be secure.
the costs are going to be enormous melanie way too much money to be throwing out at a situation that you shouldn t have had to deal with in the first place that s first of all second always remember you ve done nothing wrong to warrant such an occasion to where you needed to raise money for one man  little boy boy but that s neither here nor there third i somehow accidentally ran into his channel and i ve basically told him to f off and basically told him that if you were anywhere near someone that i cared about i d protect you that s the gist of it as i am much older than him i explain the situation from a life experience standpoint and he mysteriously shot back at me saying some other garbage that i won t bother to enumerate here either way you were in the right he s in the wrong and i hope he gets what s coming to him and you are right you should move on because he isn t worth any of your energy at all so  i am a religious man myself i m praying for your safety your health your happiness and overall god s protection over you in this horrible situation many blessings a new fan and a man of god
i m praying for you
go boom! we love ya melonie!
if you dont know the cost of suing someone  you should keep the crowdfounding going  you need to have a serious amount
you rock melonie.  you deserve better than this.  dude can crawl back to whatever slime mold he fell off of.
i ll keep praying
aaaww your voice is so funny hope you get well you should get a german shepard or malinois my wolf pack has kept me safe and gave me peace of mind for a millenia make sure to find a good french ring bite work trainer and a malligator pup youll feel sooo comfy and it s good for female humans to get male alphas theyll love and protect you against anything they are fearless and guns don t scare them if you train them right my malligators have been trained by one of the best champion trainers she s cool ill link you if you ever wanted plus they make you feel good when you pet your furry and your making me cry stop it
get some sleep  melonie  your voice sounds about as smooth as a cat s tonguei hope you manage to get things figured out
melonie if you need time off to regroup  get your head cleared  etc  then take it.  i m sure your followers  fans  and the community will understand and be patiently waiting here for your return when you are ready. please do not try to force  normalcy  before it s time - that s like going to work when you re sick   you re just gonna get sicker  stay sicker for longer  and maybe even spread it.  i know you just want a return to normalcy asap  and that is understandable  but until all this chaos is settled  that is going to be too difficult and you are just going to put yourself through more stress and strife than absolutely necessary. please just take whatever time you need for yourself  and know everyone will still be here for you. no one is going anywhere.   except that stalker - he s going right to jail.... or at least  eh is going away...  one way or another.i prescribe to you 2 hugs and a good night s rest.  get them wherever you can.
it s really hard  god never gives us more than we can handle but man does it ever get close sometimes. at least you can rest in the knowledge that god s got you  it gonna be okay
i will pray that this all gets resolved soon and the coo coo man goes away and leaves you alone. i am sorry you have had to deal with this instead of getting to play games.
melonie  work with the quartering jeremy for any leftovers to put into a fund designated for other yt s that might need the help later on down the line.
god sees everything the situation is  in his  hands     don t weep of weariness just let go and let god handle itstress causes health problemstry meditation. it helps.
stay safe and get some rest
i m playing hogwarts legacy and i m not going to let anyone stop me from enjoying the game and having a awesome time
god s got your back melonie
nothing to be embarrassed about.
melonie if you want to learn some free self defense techniques let me know. it may help you feel safe and in control. you did nothing wrong and there s nothing wrong with asking for help the lord does not expect or call you to go through your struggles alone  we are to carry one another s burdens  we are to lift each other up and encourage one another. i will pray for you. draw your strength and courage from the lord.
perhaps i don t speak for everyone but i don t think support is something that is deserved or not  it s just something good people do if they are in a place to do so      goboom
i ve never watched you game  watching other people play isn t really my jam  but i enjoy your youtube channel a lot. i really like that you are willing to talk about your faith and also call out the woke nonsense that is plaguing this country. things will work out melonie  keep talking to god and try to focus on the things you love  the rest will get sorted out.
be safe and be careful
you sound like you need to go back to normal and i am grateful that you are getting this level of support. it can t be easy.
fuck  this is heartbreaking to watch.
hey melonie  i know it s weird  but the best way i know to deal with being stalked is to make it public and make sure everybody knows it s happening and you don t want any of it. this combined with working with le and if you need them  lawyers. but doing that very thing is going to look suspicious too  people thinking you re pulling a stunt for cash and attention. it will even feel weird for you  too. trust me though  going public about this is important  and it s not a selfish or overdramatic thing to do  even if others see it that way. by all means  go back to publicly doing what you love until it s time to take action on this thing again. don t think this makes you an attention wh re or a drama queen or some kind of fraud. you deal with this stuff and then move on.
i can t say that i know how you feel  i can only imagine it feels like. what i have gathered from watching your content  you are a strong advocate for believing in god  and relying on faith for your strength. i also think i remember you saying how the enemy will try to do things to make you question that  doubt it  and eventually have you loose it. i pray you and your family are kept under the blanket of the lord s protection  after this delusional demon is delt with  you ll have a powerful testimony to spread about his devine power. you didn t ask for it  but you would be a prize to satan if you loose that faith. apologize if i offended anyone  but that s what i see...
i think you should get some security cameras. i also recommend getting a dog.
i want to stream hogwarts with you melonie.
good move- love the strawberry shortcake shirt too!
you doing you has gathered you the people that are happy to help
this is a prime example of why i adore mel.  i totally understand she s a massive introvert and hates this sort of attention.  i d put money on a decent chunk of mel s audience being part of jeremy s audience.  i really doubt anyone pities mel  not because she doesn t deserve it  but because we know she wouldn t want it.  we absolutely support her.  personally i d appreciate an update of she needs more money for lawyer fees as i know from experience with my own stalkers that those things can escalate. i know everyone wouldn t have the slightest issue dropping some extra coin to support with that so mel doesn t have to worry about it.
if you don t have one already  have a gun ready to go  a stalker s life has no value. reinforce   lock up your home and make sure to create things that can cause a lot of noise  these  people  deserve no one s remorse   attention and instead  deserve to be punished to the extreme.
i would suggest to crowd found some private security detail. a guy that drove 15 hours to lurk for you may be dangerous indeed...
she doesn t want any bullshit in her life she just wants to play video games. melonie or any other woman shouldn t have to endure this in their lifetime.
sending love your way
recommendation  continue to take the crowdfunding for legal fees and donate the rest to a charity.
wow  hope things settle down for you  sucks you have to go through this  try and focus on you  and play some video games! don t cry anymore  it breaks everyone heart to see you hurting. go boom!
lord plz watch over her  keep her safe and bring her comfort in christs holy name..amen
not pity. more  as vegeta might say  unyielding rage that someone has made this sweet woman cry.
meh  don t feel weird about the crowdfunding money. it s people investing in future entertainment. the sooner you can put this behind you the happier you ll be and the more fun videos you ll be able to make.
us nerds watch out for us nerds  together stronger.
dont have the money to help but i can start watching you stream some hogwarts legacy    seeing as i love that franchise.
hope it get sorted  sad that ppl act like that  no one deserve that. dont think anyone should feel they need to deserve compasion  that should be a human right. like a earlier comment said you dont deserve to be stalked  no one does  you do deserver compasion and support. doesnt make you less strong or weak. hope you get some fun streams.
i hope you are okay.. don t like to see women crying over some clown that doesn t deserve the energy
i agree with you melonie. i think it s best to stop giving this creep attention as i think he gets off on it. so just be careful  watch your surroundings  as there s also other dangers out there   but don t let this creep run your life. you re a beautiful young lady and should focus on the things that you enjoy. just know that we re here for you and support you all the way!you deserve a nice life with lots of fun and laughter  so the best way is to stop thinking about that lunatic. he already got tossed out of court and any  appeal  he wants to file will also get thrown out just as quickly  i also hope they charge him for wasting the court s time . he just did it in a vain attempt to get your firearm taken away  because it s clear that he s scared of it and doesn t dare to approach you knowing you can blow him away in an instant. the 2a is what is keeping you safe and i m glad you live in texas and not some crazy anti-gun state where law-abiding citizens aren t allowed to defend themselves.so best wishes with lots of love from the netherlands  and keep enjoying the things that make you happy! you don t stand alone! you got this melonie!!
love u so much friend. we here with u and for you
we need a crowdfunding campaign to hire a  professional  to take care of the  problem  permanently.
wow people crazy over opinion stay bless you got new subscribers i m praying for you
nobody deserves to be stalked.
melonie  i know you are terrified but believe me this isn t new for a youtube personality. this is a regular thing. everyone knows who the guy is  if even one hair on your head is harmed he s done and he knows this. you gotta let this go and move on. the more attention you give these kinds of people  the more they get off on it. be careful but don t be afraid  especially wen the whole world knows who the guy is.
hugs  melonie!
not your fault mel  weirdos  you re on the internets and sadly some people cant separate life from fantasy. let it go if you can  there may be more down the road so up your security and be mindful when you go out  get some mace or a sound weapon  this guy will be taken care of by the law
never ever give up who you are and what you want  nothing you do is bad  all you do is yourjoyfor video games  movies and toys is also our joy and we love watching you everyday  it never about how pretty you arebut there are psychological evil behaviors mens that feel wanting a woman to fill their empty sexual void that will satisfy themselves  they will just toss a woman away like a discharge item and then find another new sexual waythese stalkers are such are what it is  sick psychological horror behavior that they keep themselves dirty and sin against god and his beautiful creativejust stay who you are  these mens will not win in courts because they already show enough evidence how sick and their behavior are.god bless you and stay safe  let us know you play atomic heart  we want your opinion on it!!!!
please remember this verse romans 8 28  god knows you re worth it mel  trust him always and know that no matter how overwhelming it can get  he s carrying you through it all. remember that all the support and blessings you have - all of it is because of him. take care  god bless and protect you always.
we support the quartering and he said to support you. i ll admit i had my doubts  but then i watched just a few min of your content. pretty much that s all it took to see you are genuine. plus  i just can t stand a female crying. it makes me want to hurt the person that is stalking you. i m sorry you re dealing with that garbage human. i promise not all men are that bad  just most. have a blessed evening  and never be afraid to ask for help. it is a man s duty to protect a woman
unfortunately success can have it s downside as well.  people can only affect us as much as we allow them to  don t give him anymore power.
melonie mac...   never ever stop going boom...!!! we need you  we love you andwe appreciate you and all you do...   none of this is in any way your fault...and it never was...!!!love yourself because you areso beautiful  sweet    special...   we love you...   your family loves you...   and god loves you...      thanks for all you do  have done    will do...take all the time off you need...   but please come back when you can... never ever give up...because this world needs you...            be safe and take care of yourself...   battle on melonie mac...!!!go boom...!!!    melonie have you ever seen...   xena warrior princess...   it s one of my favorite series from the 90sst  lucy lawless   renee o connor...you should watch it... again thanks for everything you do and your channel... take care...   god bless you...
hang in there dude. just be careful in the mean time. this storm will pass.
you may think you haven t done anything to have the support and you actually do you just don t think what you do is worth the amount of support you have but there are loads of people who genuinely care a lot about you and want you safe you definitely didn t do anything to gain a creepy stalker
i m praying for your safety and for peace in your heart. keep your faith on the finished work of christ on the cross.
bless you little lady..x
wow! i feel bad for melonie.i like the melonie that goes boom! this is hard to watch... i can t believe some loser is making her life this difficult!
just think of it as them sending you love mel...
slow down kiddo  people like you and they just want to help. god sends you what you need when you need it. evil won t win  you are going to be fine.
hey  i m not gonna get too deep into this.. and this might sound odd  but pray for the stalker. if you want them to leave you alone forever pray for them. proverbs 25 22. i only share this because you say you re a believer. hope this helps i ll keep you in my prayers.
nobody deserves this kind of terrible treatment  i hope you re able to get past this and continue doing the things you re passionate about. we don t need to go after the scumbag that s doing this  because the lord himself will vindicate you.
breathe melonie  breathe. try to relax a little. nobody that follows you thinks you are doing this for giggles. be safe young lady.
keep it pal you got this
eph 6 10 finally  be strong in the lord and in his mighty power. 11 put on the full armor of god  so that you can take your stand against the devil s schemes. 12 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood  but against the rulers  against the authorities  against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. semper fi  melanie!
oh lord i pray that you deliver this woman from the hands of the enemy that you keep her safe and bless herwherever  she may wonder.  lord you have already claimed victory  over the enemy and every dark presence  that may try to infiltrate  or influence  her life. to you we give the glory and highest  praise  in jesus  name amen.
you are beautiful and wonderful lady of god. you have god before  behind  and all around you.... along with a army of support and family.
i hope this case is handled well and this parasite doesn t have any connections that enable him to win this case when he s clearly in the wrong  like a certain satanically influenced political party .as far as getting back to normal  there s a weirdly named game that came out on valentines day called wanted  dead  that stuck out to me when i saw the pre-release trailers that showed a lady protagonist that wasn t beaten to death with the ugly stick  shoving political propaganda in my face  and it actually looked like it had some fun action. other trailers showed me that it was from the former developers of past games that i liked  ninja gaiden and dead or alive   so things were looking up and it was one of the games i m looking forward to.then it released and while not being a failure  i did remember the many problems when playing ng on the xbox and another title i played the demo of that was a collab between the some people at team ninja some dark souls developers called nioh and had similar issues there.  part of it was me not playing ninja gaiden or any challenging game for quite a while and being babied by warframe  the other is that now i m playing an ng-like title on my pc  with a mouse and keyboard  instead of a console and controller.  the other issue is that this game is vastly different than ng or dead or alive  because basic enemies can and will end you with ease....anyway  if you get time or money  its not free to play  if need be i could scrape some money together and get you a copy if you want me to  if so  what platform  i got it from steam but its on other systems as well  to get it  it would be good to see your take on it  if it peaks your interest at all
i m a vegan and i support you  melonie    that guy is delusional bully and needs to learn to leave people alone.
out of many bigots  one. we are with you  melonie. let us know to send 100 pizzas to this guy s house  and we will do it.
all the love and hugs.
why is melonie mac always cursed  first  it was the gamestop thing with some psycho on twitter making her lose her job and now this. leave this poor woman alone! she doesnt deserve to be treated this way. i hope you re okay. dont apologize for crying! it isnt your fault.
you re not handling this well  i can see that  but i suppose you are stronger than that one gamer s girlfriend who left the room over chat comments. if this stalker at all has to do with the woke mob  understand that this is what they do  and they ll stoop to any tactic to ruin the lives of those they hate. may god bless you with strength melonie.
i m sorry you re are going through this. just have to remember that god has a plan for all of us and jesus is right there beside is. carrying you in the dark.
sorry for your situation.  you might reach out to your local christian motorcyclist association.  sheep dogs need to sheep dog.  don t take risks  trust in the lord. god bless!
you can always donate the extra money to a charity
i m truly sorry for what happened to you and you don t need to apologize it s not your fault but i m here for you if you need anything okay  i feel your pain it s it hurts me to see you like this you re not alone  god got your back and he will fight for you don t give up keep praying and i m praying for you everyday please try to get some rest ok  3
i wish there was something i we could do to help you
we re all there for you mel. stay strong don t let this creep get to you he s just being a down right victim and asshole. i will continue watching your content even if i disagree with some of your opinions. i send you happiness  love and kindness
unite this awful event in your life to our blessed lord s cross and ask him to use it to save souls including those who persecute you. god bless and hang in there
keep collecting evidence and stay safe.
everyone has seen the stalkers mug. he s kind of a painted target now. he d be wise to crawl into a hole into the ground like saddam did  cause the same fate might catch up with the dude.
lifting you up in prayer.
melanie is like   im tired of the drama i just wanna go play some hogwarts legacy   oh boy better turn off chat!
you have every right to enjoy games and your community without being hassled . truly messed up.
remember melonie the devil seeks to steal your peace. we are with you and god is with you. stay strong and rely on him.
holy shit man. i don t follow you  i don t know the situation. i am doing stuff with my headphones in and youtube played this... i m sorry you re dealing with something so disruptive  i wish i could do more than send you 11  for your legal costs. but also  you seem you have a lot of support  i doubt anyone would be butthurt if you had some cash leftover and put that towards a few sessions of counseling or buying yourself something cool. don t stress  the lawyer has everything under control  play your games and do your nerd things
it will be ok hun hug s
have not i commanded thee  be strong and of a good courage  be not afraid  neither be thou dismayed  for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest.  josjua 1 9
hi melonie. here is a prayer from the anglican book of common prayer for you     lighten our darkness  we beseech you  o lord  and by your great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night  for the love of your son  our saviour jesus christ. amen. i hope that it helps.
your immune system must ve been weakened by all of the stress from the recent events in your life.
is there a way to  have your stalker - be made to pay for any attny court filing etc fees     have him pay - when if applicable ... and you keep maintain your go fund me - to cover any costs that he can t be made to pay for   ... bet - if he s made to cover both his costs... and your costs - for these  had it not been for his psycho-obsessed harassment   unnecessary court activities...- he d be quickly inclined to stop.
hang in their. if you get more money than you need they are other charity s that deal with douche bags who your dealing with. i wish i could handle this fior you like i did my kid. after the 8th bone i broke he got the stay away messages.
have i not commanded you  be strong and courageous. do not be afraid  do not be discouraged  for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go.  joshua 1 9

just to distract you from all that for a few seconds with geek talk... is that a thermaltake case i see behind the g-fuel poster   i have the x9 small-refrigerator sized case  which nicely holds my computer parts with enough room left for a small child.  it s one of the few cases that lets you put the motherboard flat and lets gravity keep things seated  but still has enough room for the big cpu coolers.  hope things go well for you!
it s a damn shame you can t even enjoy nice things these days because some asshole can t learn to let shit go. you gave him plenty chances to drop and forget this whole thing and he still persists. you have no control over the people who s still dogpiling this guy and for good reason. but don t worry you got this  it s another day in clown world where these people feel like they can get away with harassing others just because their beliefs don t fit with the woke narrative.
he s not going to stop unless he s forced to
ok i don t know you at all  i m not a gamer and not interested by the nerd world more than that. i follow the g g team  the majority of them because  of dan vasc  he s the one i follow basically and not because of his gamer stuffs but because of the other part of his job. anyway i couldn t just follow him and not get interested by all of you guys  and i did well to get curious about the rest of you because you are people this world misses  and i mean it  you have so much value  all of you.but seeing you in this situation while you didn t do anything for that and the guy in question is someone who had that  intuition  you d be his future wife keeps running at you with threat while obviously you re afraid for your safety and you push him away the best as you can is really unacceptable. if his intuition were right  things would have been different. wayyyyy different. it s not intuition but very bad mental health imo  and it s more than time for him to stop. i hope it will be solved and he will get once for all that he has to leave you alone. i don t know what would make him understand that but it will come  i m sure. and you do very well to keep us update. keep doing what you do best and stay strong!
if he stalked you then whats there too worry about  it s not like he will win court  let him pay the expanses. if he d liked you he would ve apologized.
stay safe  i hope to see those reciepts....because i want to see a bunch of guns on that list lol. get an ar  a springfield hellcat  a mossberg shotgun...just get something
so   was this a  thankyou   video for people who donated to her lawyer costs or was it a  i need more money   video or what  whatever  i hope it all works out for her but i think this video might be a mistake as it shows that it s getting to her.that he s getting to her. man  i feel really bad for her   i reckon she ought to take a short break from youtube  because if she s not doing too good   and the people who don t like her see her all upset like this  they will use it against her  unfortunately. once they spot weakness they ll use it   you know what they re like they re horrible. god has got your back  mel  you ll be o.k.
all 7 of your female fans also support you.
remember joshua 1 9  have not i commanded thee  be strong and of a good courage  be not afraid  neither be thou dismayed  for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest. keep your eyes on jesus and it will all be ok.
thumbs up for support and a thumbs down for the topic. i wouldn t pause the crowd fund because this guy needs to be buried in the legal side of this. f around and find out. any of the excess funds i m sure your fans could be polled on an appropriate charity that could benefit other people who may be in a similar situation.
hang in there.
i will pray for you melonie with this prayer  almighty god in the name of your son yeshua jesus i ask that you send your holy angels to protect melonie from all evil and from the spirits of darkness under the protection of your wings and that you reveal your truth so that she too may be saved through the mighty name of jesus christ.  matthew 11  29 take my yoke upon you and learn from me  for i am gentle and lowly in heart  and you will find rest for your souls 30 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light. two good christian songs to listen to encourage you oceans where your feet may fails and thank you lord  https   www.youtube.com watch v pfpeefkig2i  2- https   www.youtube.com watch v k44trvhtzx4  one bonus song by messianic jews adonai machaseinu https   www.youtube.com watch v kyrqmqyrsg0
keep your chin up kid. it ll all work out.
father i pray in jesus name i lift up my sister in christ melonie onto you o lord. lord i pray that you will place a mighty hedge of protection around her fill her and baptize her with your holy spirit and remind her that you will keep her in your perfect peace and help her to walk in your joy and peace and guard her heart from the enemy s attacks for greater is he that is in you than he who s in the world have your way in jesus name i pray amen
it s time bad does come to him. call his local police department and serve him with a no contact statement so if he contacts you in any way he will be arrested and held him custody. calling his employer could make it worse but he might need to have his little world come down on him. i m against violence to innocent people. innocent people
hey girl  i wish you the best  hope they catch this idiot stalker creep and lock him up for a long time.
i paused the crowdfunding campaign because it was getting higher than i anticipated i think you should continue. if you are worrying about getting more than you need you can either turn extra into funding for something else you can do for the community as well or do charity with it if you like.
anywhere anytime anyplace!! we got your back!!!
there is an epidemic of lonely men  and not every one of us has a sane handle on said loneliness.this dude is just a sad basket case.
she re-opened it because a lot of folks wanted to keep supporting her.
psalm 4 1-8 nasb95answer me when i call  o god of my righteousness! you have relieved me in my distress  be gracious to me and hear my prayer.  2  o sons of men  how long will my honor become a reproach  how long will you love what is worthless and aim at deception   3  but know that the lord has set apart the godly man for himself  the lord hears when i call to him.  4  tremble  and do not sin  meditate in your heart upon your bed  and be still. selah.  5  offer the sacrifices of righteousness  and trust in the lord.  6  many are saying   who will show us any good   lift up the light of your countenance upon us  o lord!  7  you have put gladness in my heart  more than when their grain and new wine abound.  8  in peace i will both lie down and sleep  for you alone  o lord  make me to dwell in safety.
maybe take a little break  take a deep breath. be strong kid
i cannot wrap my head around what female content creators have to deal with. the vitriol i receive as a dude is one thing  but you ladies have it at another level for putting yourself out there. i agree with jeremy  not a red cent of this should be on you. go have fun and put this away.
that man needs serious help. i am praying for you melonie  i really hope this blows over. i am a bit out of the loop here  but did you try to get a restraining order on him   wesupportmeloniemac
don t cry dude  atleast not on camera as annoying as that sounds it will feed into that assholes egostay strong and know that your audience and friends have your back
i watch those lawyer videos  you have to prove actual malice  if you sue the stalker  because you are viewed as a public personality that simple slander isn t enough to invoke a ruling in your favor.  keep a record of all the malicious stuff.  always  tell the stalker   go away  i don t like you   if he is near your property  you have the right against trespassing  and tell him   leave the property  you are trespassing  don t come back.   that is what i do  there are some salesmen who are not welcome at my home  because they are scam artists  they lie with a smile  like a fascist interrogation method  as your best friend  until you are ruined.  moreover  it is a constitutional right to take pictures  including at an auto accident or police incident  don t be afraid to take out your smartphone and start taking pictures.
stay strong
if you re spirit led believer.  which i believe you are.  and you re doing what the lord has lead you to do  then that means the devil is going to do what he can to break you down make you feel miserable and eventually get you to give up. because he knows if you keep going down the path the lord has for you  you re going to do some damage to his plans that he s spend years to decades on. the joy of the lord is your strength.keep your eyes on him and he ll get you through anything in your way. would you ever think that god would allow something bad happen to you if he knew you couldn t handle it  no. he knows where your faith is at. you got this
melonie sound like kallmekris when she plays riley  but i hope she gets well soon
ooh i can hear it in your voice girl  i know it s bothering you  it s okay!.... everything is gonna be okay! it sounds corny  i know... but try not to let it stress you too much. you don t want to give off indication that it s affecting you too much because that would be like letting him know he has access to your emotions. you re worth way too much to for that and you know it!
we love you we got your back
keep your faith strong melonie  we are all here for you!
for the stream  you can block the word  stalker  and the dudes name and i think add a message  please don t bring up that subject. thank you.
stay strong  f that creep
get well soom mel
i m sorry ... i wish i was in a financial situation to help you out. unfortunately i can t.but my heart goes out to you. and i m pretty sure 99.9 percent of your male viewers would love nothing more  then for you to play games and talk to us in peace and harmony
from what i understand of this lady  all she did was exist and do her gaming thing. i heard of the story from a third party source initially it is absolutely bonkers.it really does give me bjork bomber sort of vibes and people can be pissheads on line but this is ....fucking crazy.
this whole situation is very weird .. this guy must be bonkers
you sound like you were on a festival and enjoyed yourself while screaming your lungs out
oh no  she s wearing the strawberry shortcake sweater!  she must be in bait mode!  if you haven t guessed by now  i tend to treat things that bother me by mocking them mercilessly.  it might be a helpful option.  i would recommend preemptively locking down your likeness as well  with the advent of deepfake technology.
extra points if her sweater smells like fresh strawberries!!
she s doing every thing she can. and she s working with her lawyer
@the real stephentv  good. that s good news to hear.
we support and protecc our own  plain and simple.  money is easy and if more is needed say the word.
ms mac i got your back if you need help i am quite sure all your followers will assist you
just realized she wore the strawberry shortcake sweater lol
sending love your way
honestly melonie i could only watch 1 45 minutes of your video  you really sounded as though you where going to cry. i hope this guy suffers  i hope he get s to feel agony for the next couple of years of his life. it s one thing to stalk people online  it s another thing to do it in real life. i hope and pray that the same sleepless nights you got  get  put back on him 10 fold. you are a brave woman  you will get through this.
stay safe
it s not much but here s a sub  i hope that helps with something.
basically melonie mac is eve and the stalker is the serpent like i said
this video is a great example to show anyone who believes in gun control. he came after her ability to protect herself. stay safe mel. and good on jeremy s fans.
this too shall pass  3
you are right.. you do not deserve this. this being a crazed stalker messing with you. consider it this way  satan sent the stalker  god sent the rest of us to help carry your burden dealing with the stalker. hang in there  we are with you.
omg you wore the catnip t-shirt  get ready they re going to come out in droves lol
this is the video clip they ll play on a true crime podcast unless somebody takes this guy out. this is chilling. she is pleading for her life. everybody should feel safe. clearly  this dude lives rent-free in her head now. we are watching something horrific play out in real time. this guy doing all this put out a video that actually has him painting himself as a victim yet clearly  incredulously  makes threatening remarks and caring her to challenge him. a man who has created twenty eight fake accounts to taunt her and is on record saying she will be his future wife. that sounds like a guy twenty four hours away from going full clocktower on society. since he won t accept that the wedding in his head has been called off  can we go back to street justice please.
you wore that strawberry shortcake sweater out of spite lmao
we have your back!
fight the good fight.
let the lawyers handle it.
don t worry about that nut job.  go get sleep and play games and turn off the internet for a while.  we all support you.
problem is you re too cute   and there is too many creeps
hello your friendly neighborhood black man sorry too hear what your dealing with never dealt with something like that just don t loose faith you will make it though this
just let her play video games  man!!!  ...  i love you  mel  3 .... not in a creepy stalker way.... community group hug   no   ok...
karma will come for him.  he s bringing it all on himself.
i don t want to see you crying. but you got my support
guy sees a pretty girl on youtube-  guess im gonna stalk her
just think about what you would think about someone asking for help in your shoes  i think you would think the same as we all do so dont feel guilty about asking for help.please be safe and take good care of yourself.
we have been collecting screenshots of sharto s incriminating comments incase they get deleted before your lawyer gets ahold of them.
best of luck  real shitty situation but you shouldn t need to explain yourself to people with showing receipts. take care and be safe
i ll pray melonie hope this goes away soon
stay safe

remember when jesus walked on water.  keep your focus on god.  pray about it.  this will all end soon.  bad things happen to good people  we all go through hardships in our lives  we just need to keep our faith in god.  in jesus-name  please help melonie through these hard times  and i pray the man bothering melonie  wakes up and realizes what he is doing is wrong and finally gains sight on peace.  whatever problems he is having  i pray that the holy spirit rebuke those demons involved with both of these people s lives.  for melonie and for the man  please lord  cast these demons away in jesus-name. we must remember to not hate our enemies  as much as it is hard not to.  we must remember that we all face the same fate.  god bless you all  and melonie  please take some rest from this  and pray about it.  ask god what he wants you to do.  take care melonie.
hugstake care of yourself.let s play some games.
you need to get a ar15 for home defense and a pistol for carrying in public places.
wow that is horrible. i hope everything gets sorted out and this asshole leaves you alone.
do take care of yourself
go  hogwarts legacy!
the stalker needs his internet taken away. it would benefit you both very gratefully.
all those who advocate for the lord get attacked by the adversary
you did nothing wrong.   you were living your life online and having fun and some person decided to become obsessed with you and harass you.  take that money and get a security system  a good one.  pay for one that is monitored so that if anything happens you get eyes on the situation.    i want to say it again.  you have done nothing wrong.
@reekhavoc   have you done so  i think you should be the one moving along.
for the love of god read this please.you will get this sorted out  you have guardian angels. i think you know what this mean 11 11.once you have defeated this demon in human form and you will.you must rest and heal. make a private social account for only those you can trust. take back control of your life  social media has become too dangerous to have yourself put out there now.please take some time for yourself  if your fans are you concern then if they are really your fans they will be more than willing to wait. it s admirable that you are standing up for people but who s standing up for you  once again  you will be victorious in this battle but once that s over  let go and let god battle the rest.you have guardian angels everywhere  trust them they are on active duty.
fighting off a cold. - nothing to do with sleeping. - are you taking daily vitamin d   about 8000 iu   day     you need to if you stay indoors all day.

what s up with the state department that you are in  what s up with the law enforcement
what was the update
bring this situation to the alter of the lord and he will see you through this adversity. as 2 corinthians 12 10 states   for the sake of christ  then  i am content with weaknesses  insults  hardships  persecutions  and calamities. for when i am weak  then i am strong.  you will get through this. you re a child of the living god and he will never leave you nor forsake you. stay steadfast in the word of the lord and he will remove this obstacle from your path.
the guy needs to be locked up for a long time
you sound depressed af when you re cold  yikes
buy guns and ammo with the rest. stay safe
just crazy...
godspeed.
the enemy knows when you are getting closer to god and will attack you because he knows he is losing his grip on you. focus your sight on god and follow jesus  our king  through this storm. i am still praying for you and i have faith that christ will see you through this.

keep in the faith god can do so much in a world controlled by satan
hello  i have just been made aware of this situation and popped on over.this person gives off some serious bjork bomber levels of crazy.please stay safe people are fucking nuts. ive seen some crazy shit in my day...but what the fuck.
the 2nd amendment is less expensive than the legal process.

do you own a gun  time for a refresher course. if not. buy a gun and got to a course to learn how to use it safely. train weekly. time for some great equalizer.
then  play the games
what the hell happeend
unfortnatly  this can be part when become a public person. so keep your head high.
hug
yes she has a gun. and she does train with it

take up boxing..
melonie  i can t answer why our father in heaven yhwh has his children deal with traumatic situations like what your going through but i can tell you that god will never leave you or forsake you and in the end god will give your stalker his reward which is hellfire and brimstone.
do u ever play any wwe 2k or raw vs smackdown
in christ were brothers and sisters in christ our friend brother and king he s our best ruler only god bless you sweetheart may god protect you from this  moron god bless you sweetheart sister in christ
and god dies bless his children! you are one of his children as a born again christian! it s called grace!
girl it s not pity. we see the injustice and we know this could be any of us. he is weaponizing judicial system against you amd that s wrong. it cannot stand amd mo one deserves that.
feeling cute. delete l8r
play some call of duty
your voice is different this time  i can hear you are burned out and you are in a horrible position right now
at best take the left over and donate to a battered women s shelter. i doubt any donators will care.
what happen  who is stalking her  lol  some people have too much free time and no problems in life if they stalk people.. anyway  don t worry about it.. this world is full of dysfunctional people in a way or other  even as a man you will have problems like this.don t give them attention  and focus on your goals.
jesus i tought that it was news about s.t.a.l.k.e.r the game.... you tube mesed with me on recomandation...
do you play fortnite  melanie mac   have a wonderful day
well  it s obvious that you want to focus on games  jesus and so on  but you see  sometimes there are some people or lunatics that doesn t care  and will exploit the fact that you re christian girl and will play vulture on your conscience. do not negotiate with him. it s a loss of time. don t hesistate and go to court. get a lawyer to help with that situation and catch him on disturbing the peace or if it is a case and happened on the place where you are living - trespassing which caused mental distress. not every court will consider this - it can depend on state  but it is worth a shot. and last but not least - do not give him time on your videos more than it is necessary. in the end you will see that he is not relevant. he is just another andy looking for attention. no need to give him that.
so that lawyer told you to hold all comments  as he should
cops  restraining order
girl contact the police again! you look pretty scared ffs. please go tell them. and please be careful and alert your neighborhood about it. tell them to look around and be your eyes when they can. don t cry and don t give in ok
she s got a lawyer working on it.
guys mostly get swattedgirls mostly get stalkersi 100  would rather take the swatting
as you are my future ex-wife  i have your back and will help anyway i can.
damn it must suck being beautiful huh
smart move melonie ... just limit your updates ... because the stalker is doing this to get your attention on him  because he can t have you any other way to be with him  it s a classic stalker move.
stop falling into the trap   and you are ignore it and just deal with the police only
help me  help me. that s e-begging. like talking rent and child support. e-begging unite. just saying
in support of melanie i m unsubscribing. all of this will stop when we stop needing to be online. tough love. goodbye
sorry that this is happening to you  but you have other youtubers helping you you are well  off too and growing its like a millionaire asking real poor people for help sorry but what about the nobodies that deal with way wore and many more people not 1 or two how about the wealthy helping the poor not the wealthy  helping the wealthy to get more subs just like tim pool don t feel that bad how many white nights came to your aid  while the rest suffer in silence
i think she just overracting for this issue anyway shes the main reason why metoo movement exist on west even she disagree with feminism but her bahaviour dint behave that way
the thing i don t understand is....how is making videos on all this a means of protection   posting videos seems counter productive.
i think it s poor taste to fundraise off this. go after him for legal fees you will win or come back when it s all said and done an you know how much money you need to cover.
melonie i m only asking you remove your slanderous content  you are cashing out my reputation with false allegations you are in no imminent danger and it is my safety that is being jeopardized .if these people supported you they would be shepherding you towards that understanding ..but they don t .spare the acting  you are profiting from it .what is preventing you from removing those videos  what clouds you re sense of reason
can t you just ignore him  it s not like he is doing anything.
other people are doing this for her
soy boy
