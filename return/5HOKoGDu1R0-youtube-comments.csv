I love how you speak the truth! keep it up sister

thank you so much for these great videos!! there s a reason they call it comic relief in movies after something bad happens. laughter is healing!also the recent events have me actually reading revelation again. trying to remind myself not to be afraid in these times while also being a good reminder to continue doing God s work even when it becomes increasingly difficult. I love how you embody that with including the Bible verses at the end of your video! keep going boom  girl!

as the world seems to burn  the smartest thing we can do  is read from our history so we cantry to find solutions from our past. love how you are connecting Bible passages with modern events! go boom!

also  loved the verse of the day mel.  who knows maybe we are in the end times but in the end what can we really do about it besides sharing God's love with as many people as possible before we leave this earth and laugh at the horrible situation we're in.
