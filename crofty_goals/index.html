       *                      properties:
       *                      - onEnterResult: The return value from `onEnter`. This will be
       *                                       `undefined` if `onEnter` threw an exception.
       *                      - exceptionOccurred: `true` if an exception occured inside
       *                                           the boundary.
       *                      - retrieveException: A function that returns the exception
       *                                           that occurred. Calling this will prevent
       *                                           the exception being thrown from `enter()`.
       *                                           Rethrow it if you don't want to handle it
       *                                           yourself.
       *                      If an exception occurs inside the boundary this will still
       *                      be called, and the exception will be rethrown, unless you call
       *                      `retrieveException`.
