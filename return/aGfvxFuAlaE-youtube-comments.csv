God is using you so well and Im glad I ran across your channel.

I really really really liked your message today about self control. thats an area that I need to work on. thank you for talking about that. God bless you and your family.

just proves that the world hates God to their core. so melonie keep sharing God s word and his son  Jesus Christ our savior. never give up the good fight. we win in the end! God is my Lord  but you are my hero!

Im a recovered alcoholic  tobacco smoker  binge eater  and p0rnography addict.  sober since august of 2018 and I get hostile with anyone trying to push or persuade me to go back to that junk. I cant even be in a pub without feeling sick. I love eating and drinking right  staying focused on Jesus Christ  and working out five to six days a week. I feel like batman.

Im happy that I have signed up to your channel melonie  keep going the way you are you will make 100k views in no time.
