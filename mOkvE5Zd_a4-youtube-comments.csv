for a group that wants love and acceptance  they sure are quick to hatred and grudges.
i m so proud of jk rowling for standing up for her values. hogwarts legacy is a huge hit in my house  and she managed to make harry potter even better for having spoken up.
i think the trans community is just mad because jk created polyjuice potion to change boys into girls easily and they are just mad because they can t just drink mud.
whenever trans activists go nuts against something  it can only be good. whenever they grab my attention by going crazy  i go for exactly that thing. i buy it  play it  watch it and spread the word and encourage others to do the same. i am confident they will let me know when the next best thing comes up and i ll do the same again
harry potter  existstrans  you re on my list.
i generally leave blair and buck alone. i feel sorry for them to be honest because i know they re dealing with issues that probably aren t easy to quantify. the people that are on my nerve are these moronic and weak men jumping into a wig and taking things from real women.
she created the world. she should have a say in what is done with her story. hopefully it turns out better then rings of power or velma.
thank you for continuing to speak out melonie. glad to see you re doing well  keep it up.
these people have truly no shame and absolutely no brains.i d say we need more people like melonie in the world  but she s too precious and could never be replicated.so much love and respect for this lovely woman
even the kids!!!!!  omg i spit out my coffee through my nose!!!!!!!!
remember  she s their enemy number one for at least four years now and they re not letting an inch of that hate go  take that into consideration when it comes to when you boycott things.
cause boycotting the game worked out so well  lol.you look beautiful today  melonie
not even the children shall be spared  no mercy shown.  said the good  merciful  kind person lmfao
if they stay true to the books  than i would be interested in seeing this series. yes you should do a marathon. you may actually like it.
honestly i m kinda pumped to see an in depth version of harry potter. the movies were pretty good  but as with all book-to-movie adaptations  there s bits that were cut  and bits that were changed.this is a send chance to actually stay true to the books and even expand on the lore.i agree with you on the concerns about this being yet another overwoke ensemble. fingers crossed that this is like watching a harry potter video game being streamed in high def without some yaywho crying in the background about latency and potion issues
i ve always thought it would be a great idea to make this into a series instead of just movies. i just hope it s not ruined like every other remake out there.
i love how these lunatics are claiming that  no one asked for this  when i know for a fact that isn t true  because a lot of hp fans  including myself  have been asking for this for years. i ve always said that harry potter should be a tv series because so much content from the books was cut or changed for the movies  whereas a tv series would have a lot more time to work with so they wouldn t have to cut so much.
if they make every season a true adaptation of each book i would watch them.
these are definitely rational people who don t need to be locked away for the good of society.
can they cast elijah wood as adult harry just to salt radcliffe s wounds
getting beaten up pretty consistently as children does that to a person.  grudges  at least.
@ypsiroselee  oh please  they should join the club.  its no excuse to hate as much as these activists do.  instead of dealing with trauma  they re encouraged to lash out at their  enemies  real or not.
they don t want love and acceptance  they want validation and obedience  which isn t any different than what any insecure person wants.
@ypsiroselee  so they liked it and want some more
@ypsiroselee  bull  i was bullied my entire childhood and what these loons do is insane to me. there s no excuse.
@aetherial  that s because unlike them  you don t have a victim mentality and refuse to define yourself by your trauma. you re stronger than most. society needs more like you.
let s not forget death and rape threats.
@ypsiroselee  stop making excuses for abusers. look what jk rowling has been through and yet she doesn t threaten or hold a grudge against anyone.
you do realize this jk politics is left wing
@gloria thomas  so
@wyatt earp  she s also  woke .
@cantnevercould96  and  she has the right to her opinions. just because you don t agree with her  doesn t mean you can t respect the fact she stands up for what she believes in. unlike most other public figures who turn into cowards when the mob comes after them.
@gloria thomas  as long as she has good character and doesn t force others to agree with her or else  j.k. rowling is not a bad person in my book. i ve seen a number of righties who are just as nutty as extreme lefties.
@wyatt earp  a lot of woke liberals also  stand up for what they believe in  and yet they get clowned on. rightfully so.
you bought and played trashwarts legacy you paid money for another bland  boring open world game with nothing to actually do hope you enjoyed those frame drops lmao.
@dragon ball fans can t read  yes
that s the funniest part. after all the knee-bending  sometimes to a hilarious and stupid degree  they are still on her ass. you can appeal to the woke mob forever  and then get cast into the pits for one wrong move in their eyes.
my idea of love and acceptance for those people involves 165 grains at 2700 fps  repeat as often as required.
i ll only be mad if they race change. sex change and make characters that are straight gay...
@ypsiroselee everyone gets beaten up consistently as a child. lol they aren t special
@yuno gasai  no the funniest part is you hipster contrarians paying for a trash game.
a guy a used to work with just told me this story a couple days ago and it makes me sick thinking about it. he said his daughter has these 2 friends that are sisters. he said they were these really beautiful girls  like 14 years old. so the one sister is seeing a counselor and the counselor suggested that maybe the reason she has difficulty connecting with people is that she s not really a girl  she s a boy.so he br@inw@shes her into believing she s a boy  she starts taking all these male hormones and whatever else and now this once beautiful little girl looks like a twisted freak of nature. now she s going to have her breasts completely removed soon.this counselor br@inwashed her  it never even would have occurred to her that she was really a boy if that pos counselor wouldn t have put that bs in her head.and the parents actually went along with this crap every step of the way. never even occurred to them that it s strange that she started seeing this counselor and now suddenly thinks she s a boy.so now she has all these new friends and is getting all this attention and special treatment  which could influence some of her friends to do the same just for the attention.in a sane world this counselor would be fired asap and the parents would be arrested for child abuse. it s scary that society has been ind0ctrinated to see this child mutilation as acceptable. apparently the mother thinks it s the greatest thing ever and that everyone should do it.this s@tanic world just keeps getting worse and worse. it was slow and gradual at first so people wouldn t notice but now they have the people under such extreme mind c0ntrol that it will continue much more rapidly in this downward spiral.
@dragon ball fans can t read  your parents havnt beaten you enougu
i think you may be onto something...
that and she didn t allow men to walk into the young girls bedrooms in legacy.
huh  maybe that is why they also hate anime too.
i genuinely laughed out loud at that. thank you!
@simon m  that s against trans rights
but does polyjuice potion actually work across genders  every instance i m aware of where it was used  it was used to become people of the same gender as the drinker.
@hawkcam1996   in the death hollows part 1 if i m not mistaken  the save  harry team  all transform into harry by drinking poly juice to trick the death eaters form capturing harry. .
@s- nova  oh yeah. forgot about that. good point.
@simon m   damn  that s a good one
lol this is so true. i do the same. they are the perfect barometer for what i will probably enjoy. if they hate it  it s for me!
yeah how dare they dislike a terf.  syou re a hipster contrarian.you only latch onto something if trans activists dislike.further reiterates my notion that the only people who played trashwarts legacy were hipster contrarians and the most die hard potter fanatics  even though the game was objectively mid.
@dragon ball fans can t read  you people are going against what the majority of people like. that means you are the contrarians.
yup. it s just like banning books
activists say down and i say up. anything they think is bad must be good. totally agree we should give jk more money. she deserves it !!! hope she does not sell out to disney or wb or universal.
@morgan pike  that s the spirit. and more often than not you ll discover something wholesome fun and awesome when you start hearing their angry screams all over the internet  just follow the noise
for real. their rage got me to buy a ps5 just to be able to play legacy. i never went from ps3 ps4 and hadn t even touched the 3 in at least 4 years.
jk rowling  huh  sorry  i can t hear you past the fence.
@the hateful analizer  what was that  i couldn t hear you inside my vault  inside my castle.
probably worst luck
that s any man dressing up like that in the first place is taking away from women doesn t matter what their intentions r it s all disgusting and we should be accepting none of it no matter what side they claim to be on
@justin lingle  seganerd1991   yep. i actually agree with blaire on a lot of things and think he s a decent person  but i just can t bring myself to lie and call him a woman. he s not and he ll admit that. the whole thing is bizarre to me  why you d want to live your life in a fake body. it s also highly deceptive. even people like blaire who aren t pronoun police and who don t claim to be the opposite sex  they re still implicitly lying by getting all these medical procedures to simulate the opposite sex  and by adopting our clothes and manner of speaking and our spaces. it s all a carefully crafted act. i couldn t live around someone like that because it s not real. how could you trust anything they say
@cranberry noodle  and it defeats the whole definition of being a conservative lol
well  it would be hard to be worse. i agree  though. if jk says   this is now canon to hp universe   then that s what it is.
we don t need more people like melonie  i faked being stalked  mac.
@dragon ball fans can t read  i reviewed a few videos about the  stalker  thing and the guy in question is completely unhinged  he has quite clearly lied about several things including saying melonie put his address on social media and was urging people to attack him when actually someone asked melonie if she wanted them to send her his address  and then said unhinged person decided to put his address in the comments himself  and that s just one example  he continuously made new accounts to attempt to contact melonie  and that s just a couple things of why he s an unhinged psycho. or maybe he s not unhinged but instead is trying an elaborate scheme to make money by suing somebody who s better off than him.anyway i could write a small essay on this but there s not really any point  the guy is a liar and a creep.it s so easy to see melonie is a genuine sweetheart  that has some weirdo fantasising about her being his  future wife . i doubt he s the first dude on the internet to send her weird messages. that s what female content creators have to deal with unfortunately and we should all be supporting melonie on this matter.have a good day!
i lost my composure after reading it
you may laugh  but i hope the kids who are cast in this show get a lot of protection.  because they are going to be attacked by this trans mob.
these people believe that it s offensive to expect them to forgive anyone.
yeah the movies did ron dirty
if its the new woke revision that rowling was feeding to the twitter crowd  before they turned on her  then i have zero interest.
the movies were a pale shadow of the books  despite the all star adult cast.
rofl!!!
none of this needed to happen... but it is hilarious truer words never spoken
the george lucas of harry potter  eh  a most apt description of jk    i remember hearing a while back that when she started writing the hp series  before her first book in the series was published  she was advised to get another paid job - because  it wasn t going to sell well . the hp series has apparently since made her arguably richer than the late queen elizabeth!that s freaking cool!!
not a single trans person was harmed from her ideas. no one has gotten beat up by a dude goin  rowling was right! imma avadakedavra yo arse!
if the 1  is right  it s incredible how much power they ve got! everybody is listening  and far too many agreeing with them.
these people are unbelievable!! i can t believe they re actually saying this!
as long as the characters look  act  and grow how they are supposed to in the books  i m all for this reboot. hoped it was animated  though.
there was a lot of content in the books that was skipped over in the movies. the show gives the opportunity to really expand the harry potter world. i think it could be great.
troons    enjoy your harry potter at the expense of trans lives. me   challenge accepted.
i love how she s actually involved this time  the seething will be glorious
i ain t gonna lie . there are a few trans militant minded individuals who s death i wouldn t shed a tear for. but on the most part i would just like to see them get well. especially the young people who are getting seduced into this madness.
it is good they are making a reboot because emma watson became an activist. she has also said unkind things about the cast. behavior like that make reruns controversial. they need to behave like the cast in stranger things with likeable examples like millie brown.
as someone who read the books first  i am insanely excited for this. while i enjoyed the movies  i have multiple issues with them in comparison to the books.example  they did ginny  my favorite secondary character  downright dirty in the movies.the final battle between harry and voldemort was amazing in the books  and the movies completely changed iti could go on........ps  i completely lost all composure on the tweet about the kids
melonie cracks me up  she points out it s ridiculousness because it is ridiculous.  safe from wieners.  hahahaha.
so proud of jk!!
can t wait for you to stream the rest of the wizard game  melonie. biggit army   have a wonderful day.
i remember that at the beginning of the  controversy  about j.k rowling i didn t really understand what was going on and just assumed she went crazy or something  then a while later i decided to read her explanation on her website then found myself actually agreeing with her views.if only more people actually bothered to listen to the people defending themselves rather than taking their views from the hateful mob. j.k. rowling has a lot of my respect now and i understand she isn t what she was made out to be.
i did read a quote from jkr that this will be a  faithful adaptation  so hopefully that means they re sticking to as written  but there s still some leeway for wokeness there. also as i understand it  she said ok to having black hermione in the stage production of cursed child and there s supposedly no description of her in the book that specifically says she has light skin. of course  stage productions are not film canon  but take that as you will.
the success of that series all depends on the casting of the three main characters.
i love jk now  she is amazingly witty
boycott didn t work last time  but it is bound to succeed this time
she never said anything transphobic.
@rambleon07  the woke leftists disagree with what she said. that automatically makes it transphobic racist sexist etc.
@rambleon07  she said  theres two genders  thats considered violence according to the lgbt lol
this is expeliamus country
@hawkcam1996  they disagree that people should wear what they like and sleep with any consenting adult who ll have them !
that would make it a bit easier to work with. would also allow for more freedom.i just hope that the world it takes place in doesn t constantly change so much from season to season  like it did from film to film  it was changed way too much.
animated hp would be amazing
brown isn t that much better than watson
the same people who call people on the right names because they don t want to drink that toilet water called beer  are the ones triggered over harry potter  chik-fil-a  a black man on a rice box  a black woman on a syrup bottle  tim tebow kneeling for the lord  and a native hawaiian being cast as nani. did i get everything
hey melonie. you look beautiful. hope you re doing well. great video by the way. have a good day melonie
you re doing  amazing work. thank you.
i always enjoy hearing your perspective on these things.  keep up the good works miss mac!
i just wanna say that i m a huge harry potter fan it was my childhood and i bought hogwarts legacy twice one on pc and ps4 and i think j.k. rowling is awesome. what some of these people don t understand is she never said anything anti-trans  she just thinks it ridiculous for people to call women  people who menstruate  and she was basically being sarcastic saying  i think there s a word for that.  these people are taking things way out of proportion now. i have many trans friends that love harry potter and also think j.k rowling is awesome. and many of my logical trans female friends will say.  i know wasn t born a woman  i know i don t menstruate.  i laughed when they said  transgender genocide  i m like  well  my friends are still here.  i was an ally to the lgbt and i still am to the og lgbt people  i don t associate or support the new lgbt   there are too many toxic angry people in there now.
i feel like it s too soon to reboot this series but if it makes the wactivists upset  i d be more than happy to watch it. great video today melonie! you look amazing too!
rinse and repeat for the next decade with every bit of news regarding this show.
i wonder how many of these people know what jk rowling actually said
awesome video as always  melonie!i m glad you brought up buck angel and blaire white.keep going at melonie mac! go boom!
even the kids!!! yikes!! no one is exempted from these lunatics!!
i really hope they keep it the same as the movies
so  i am a fan of the films and love them to death so yea i am not really on board for this show. i am more for the wizarding world to be expanded but  i will not go crazy against people that actually want to see it. you do you!
well said and well explained. 100  agree with you.
a non-woke harry potter series would be cooli hope they don t mess this up like they did with the lotr tv series
they see me rowling. they hating..
i think an animated reboot more closely following the books would be amazing
i don t think rowling ever mentioned hermione s skin color  but whenever she wrote a black character  she did mention they were black.  angelina johnson  dean thomas  blaise zabini  etc.
women in the bathroom   i ordered no wiener and it looks like you gave me extra wiener.
its funny because you are likely correct lol jk has been pretty woke. all odds are on that this new series will have some woke agenda going on lol and its going to be incredibly funny to see people like watson and daniel being completely erased by some indian looking people  this is written in the stars .
rowling should be allowed to have her opinions. you don t have to agree with her. people do not understand how brittle freedom is. being able to say things others don t agree with is extremely important.
thank you so much  andrew
yes she does. i would be interested if it s faithful to the books.
@melonie mac go boom  you re most welcome melonie!
@what the...  already paid it.
to be fair each season is going to be 1 book so it digging into the books alot more also we can make memes on dumbledore asking quietly
melonies biggest simp lmao
@tsuyokunokyojin  damn right and quite frankly it s none of ur business who i simp for and the fact us melonie mac fans simping trigger u so much that u need to make a sad little comment makes me happy i hope ur mad  cause i m always gonna support her
@tsuyokunokyojin  leave justin alone! he s actually an awesome dude. now if you were talking about me like justin says  it s none of your business. ill do what i want with my money.
probably none. they most likely just saw a headline from kotaku and immediately started going jdjdijebchxjxi ndj
100 bucks
melonie please charge back his donations  you know he doesnt make enough money to responsibly donate and it is immoral for you to take it.
@lisa nadrone  leave her alone! i don t want the money back! it was meant to bless her. no matter what  i will always be glad to give to her.
her cheeks go pink in the books. and she shared an illustration of her being white on her website 2004
she also went brown in the sun in the books
i see the cat in the background  we need a backstory.
i personally don t care about the reboot happening  mainly because i m tired of reboots. but at least it gives the angry activists something to be angry about again. that s always funny. i just hope they don t harass someone into almost killing themselves or quitting something they love again.
i would love to see you do a harry potter watch party with ashton. hopefully she will keep her clothes on
i never had an issue with the dumbledore is gay thing  she wrote the character  and she certainly may have always seen him that way. the book never said anywhere he wasn t gay nor indicated he ever had a relationship with a woman that i can remember.
they need to reopen the drama schools.
they act like talks for a book accurate hp series haven t been going on for years. they just finally gave rowling what she wanted..a little time distance from the movies  and some kind of creative control over the project. i also suspect it has something to do with all of the people reacting to the movies and or books on youtube for the first time since 2020. the number of reaction channels exploded during lockdowns and so did the number of people watching them.
they should also do games based on the books. hogwarts legacy already gives them a base to start with.
when i was younger i was a huge fan of harry potter. to the degree i was picked as fan of the month on a swedish fansite. therfor i can with confidence share this and claim it to be fact but i will of course stand corrected if someone actually proves i am wrong . obviously some spoilers ahead  but how many years has it been  15 hermione s skincolor has never been specified. dark  untameable hair with brown eyes and protruding teeth. in one part of book 3 ron and hermione is being described as him incredibly freckly and her very brown. is she darkskinned or just tanned after a few months of summer  nobody knows. in the cursed child theatric play hermione was potrayed by an african-american  so it is possible and not wrong. there is a handdrawn picture by rowling with 5 people. neville  ron  harry  hermione and gary. who s gary  according to pottermore he was later renamed to dean thomas. in this picture dean thomas is having the most darkskinned tone. it is undetermined and as long as the other details are not wrong  i do not care about the skincolor. it s similar to harry potter eyecolor. in the book he has green eyes and in the books he has blue eyes. they tried contact lenses  they discussed using digital editing to frame by frame change radcliffe s eyecolor. is it that important that harry has green eyes  rowling answered   what is important is that he has her mother s eyes . regarding dumbledore being gay. rowling claims in an interview made with radcliffe recorded for movie 8 i believe  that she had known dumbledore had been gay for almost 10 years. it was just not important to share it. it became a thing in the script for movie 6 when they needed to change a line during tableread. it was meant that dumbledore would say something in the style of   i remember when i was young and met a beautiful young girl. love is such a beautiful thing  isn t it   if dumbledore was gay  he would never say that. and they did change the script. to add  knowing dumbledore is gay adds a completely new level of the friendship between dumbledore and grindelwald that is explained in book 7 and then explored in the fantastic beasts movies. it makes the story so much more tragic. it was never a friendship. it was dumbledore being madly in love and grindelwald a sociopathic maniac playing with his feelings. hermione s skincolor and dumbledore being gay. it is not what will make this show fail or be a success. at least not for me. to add  the movies are already very woke when they moved alot of rons smart lines to hermione  even in areas she shouldn t be perfect in. especially in the earlier books when hermione paniced she acted like a muggle  forgetting she could use magic. while ron was the guide for all magic world details. even today people argue that ron was robbed in the movies.
i m looking forward to the tv series  but cautious. as a caretaker at a high-school  im concerned about  unisex toilets  when the school  i work at got a multi million dollar refit 2 yrs ago  i voiced my concern about potential dangers.the teachers just rolled their eyes at me and said   none so far  we have doctrine in place.ie they have talked to students at assembly and in the class  about guidlines of behavior and acceptance.i m amazed none got hurt  so far and the school isn t facing lawsuits right now.
i don t currently have a hbo max subscription but i think i will get one when this is released.
is this a cash grab for max to just bank off it  probably. however  if they truely are going to stick to the books. going to keep the characters how they were made and keep all the detail. honestly  i would love the series. the movies aren t bad but things like ginny being so lifeless compared to here book counter part was sad to see. so i m excited to see the book brought to life how it should  like i always say  books are meant to be series not movies.also melonie  yes hermonie is described as white like one one book when she got back from a vacation she looked  darker   which people claim thats where its mentioned she is black but she got tanned . also  the illustrated versions of the books make her white.
i think many of the activists are going to watch it. the outrage fuels them. it must be exhausting  but we get out kicks in our own way.
samuel trans ally   just a friendly reminder that jk rowling is basically the leader of the trans genocide campaign. gingers   first time
honestly there is no need right now to remake the harry potter movies into a tv series. sure in the early four movies of harry potter some of the visual facts look out a date  but the storytelling is still really good and people who are fans today are still attached to those actors who played those characters. i don t see for a remake to be done until like 15 years have passed from right now.
ive read the harry potter series several times  currently re-reading it.. and hermoine is actually described as  looking brown  in the books at some point.. so i accept emma watson as hermoine  but i wont be upset if they cast a black actress for her.
love jkr. great one  melonie.
thanks for being yourself  mel
safe from wieners  there s a slogan for some merch.
the streisand effect is the way in which attempts to hide  remove  or censor information can lead to the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of that information.
correction it s not  hbo max  anymore just  max
they have batman the animated series  an absolute classic.
it really doesn t matter as long as she s a better actor than emma watson  which won t be difficult!
anyone using  genocide  unironically to describe a video game or tv show isn t a serious person. these out of touch crazies will be after the production every step of the way  which will be great publicity. if the show runners don t cave to pressure  the pilot could be one of the most watched shows to date
i only bought the game because of the insanity and ended up enjoying it
i was a huge fan of s1-3 of buffy and 1-3 of angel  as well. if they tried to bring it back or remake it  i d give it a shot. doesn t automatically make me a fan of weadon s antics.
i m all for re-naming bathrooms from  men s  and  women s  to  weiners  and  no-weiners i think that is a genius idea.who care what weirdo s identify as. are you packing or not packing
it s as if they re not actually the loving and tolerant people.
hey  melonie i just want to say that you are looking lovely in your outfit for today. also i just want to say that if j.k rowling wants to do the harry potter spinoff series then she should and let the wokie idiot people go away from her and find something else to fuss about and leave her alone and let her do her job for the harry potter fans  ok melonie. anyway i just want to say and make a comment about your video for today and i just want to tell you that you look amazing and lovely in your outfit for today and your curly hair looks amazing and beautiful too. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed day and have a great evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. god bless you too.
don t watch this thing or else you re bad!!  watch this thing or else you re bad!! good grief  it s all so tiresome.
actually i heard from somewhere she said that there wasn t any toilets in hogwarts  so basically they do their business and either throw it out the window or vanish it.  of course you can imagine the wtf moment since book 2 shows the toilets
honestly i m kinda in the middle now if they think there trans at a young age and they weren t force i would get that but grown men who say they automatically out of nowhere i would be no
there is something very strange similar  going on in the video game community  it s like disney and the political movement are mad at nintendo  and getting people strikes. everyone saying it s nintendo but i don t believe it. it s not as vocal  but it s still noticeable.  bur i witness this also trying to slip into that side  and nintendo isn t allowing it. i honestly doubt i m going to watch it but some of those people need a year time out from the internet for acting how they do.
i wish all wizard school enjoyers a very enjoyable reboot. hopefully it won t get completely netflixed the way amazon s rop was.
i bet their mothers are very proud of them.
awesome to see cole train going to the gym to get all buff
hey pretty melonie  so jk rowling is happy and harry potter fans are happy  too. also nice cat sleeping over there.
these potterheads should remember if it wasn t for her vision  they would have nothing to love or hate. if i was her  i would pull all the rights to my intellectual properties-- stop the movies  stop the books and see who complains louder   .
bought the game and it wasn t really my thing but fully satisfied with my purchase if only to give the finger to cancel culture.
it does make me wonder tweets that go after kids are tweets made by kids.
how many people have been attacked for deciding to keep drinking bud lite  or dox d for for still drinking bud light  or have had their children threatened for continuing to support bud light  i find it interesting there are no stories like this as opposed to when people were attacked for continuing to support hg legacy. hmmmm
you are happy about this ! arent you  jo !  lol yes. and
jk rowlins should have left it as it was  that was the best ending how they ended it. i hope they don t ruin it.
good 1 me 2
she did say that  but it s talking about before the wizarding world imported piping and the sewer system from the muggles a couple of centuries ago.
i am fully for some people  unaliving  hemselves  most school unalivers end up dying  many of them by design  if they just unalived themselves at home that would have made things better.
in the background it looks like your cat just finished her workout and is bout to put the dumbbells away
from what i remember  dumbledor did seem to have a love interest with grindelwald and a friend of mine thought the same but that just us. everyone has their own interpretation of it but the writer has the final say in it  even if we don t like black hermione.
sofia tweeting  f dem kids!!  rofl
to be fair  a lot of harry potter fans i would describe as woke. as long as they have some  but don t over do it  it should be fine
you re so based. i tap video to play  it s starts out with you saying  social media troon activists have not learned their lesson ... and i couldn t have said it better myself without explicit fedposting.
meltdowns have been so plentiful of lately lol
not gonna lie  i first thought that jk rowling must ve said or done something messed up to get this much hate. however  when i actually did my own research to see if she actually said anything with ill intent and behold  i found nothing but valid and fair points.
these activists won t quit bruhhh...
they ve come for the kids ! hilarious!!
having hp rebooted by hbo max is the only nitpick i have  here. if anything  looking back at velma... but if jk rowling is there  hope it reaches some success.
i snuck in a case of bud light to my dorm room in hufflepuff house.
will be interesting to see what will happen. will they add woke content in an attempt to calm the woke outrage  or will they tailor the content for the audience that isn t shouting at them  time will tell.
they will never learn. what do they think will happen after what happened with hogwarts legacy  all it did was boost sales. and if they do the same thing with this series  all it will do is boost views and make it more popular than it would have been originally.
and apparently game journos are also ticked that a new quidditch game got announced. just go play games  fiends.not to mention that weird-bearded dude giving you a hard time. keep goin   melonie!
this is hilarious
why isn t your channel bigger you are top five youtube commentators i bet youtube is screwing with your growth
if she changes the characters - at least it would be the creator doing it rather than someone else altering someone else s work.
i can t stop staring at the cat in the background.
making these violent trans mob people melt down is enough of a reason to do it.  and recasting the franchise away from the ingrates like watson   radcliffe  who wouldn t have a career if not for j.k. rowling  is another good reason.  even if i m not a big fan  i find it disgusting the way the trans mob threatens her and her family for daring to not agree 100  with their woke religion.
she specifically wrote that hermoine is white.
@wyatt earp  well i would need the book to see that but i haven t find it by googling it that she was set as white. because all decription of her appearance in book that i googled doesn t say she s white.
@dami fides   hermoine s white face was sticking out from behind a tree  book 3 chapter 21. most harry potter websites virtue signal  so they leave that out.
@wyatt earp  i know about that part but again that s debated on its meaning. does it mean she is white or that she s so pale because of fear.
@dami fides  bro  she s white. it s very clear what it means. i don t care about a bunch of weirdos on the internet trying to twist language to fit their narractive. she s also approved countless illustrations that depict her as being white. it was nothing more than a virtue signal.
@wyatt earp  i agree with you  even i see her as white. but  like i said in the end  the writer has the last word in it because its her creation.
@dami fides  she made it very clear  for over a decade  that hermoine is white. thankfully  i believe they are going to stick with that for the show. warners bros has an entire park  line of merchandise  and movie series the depict the character as white. if they race swap her  it s going to turn a lot of people off becasue they know what hermoine is supposed to look like. warner bros is desperate rn and they can t afford to take that chance. along with the fact that rowling has been under attack by these weirdos for a while now. i don t think she is going to compromise her story and legacy just to appease them. i feel that she will want the show to be as accurate as possible to what she created. that is why i am optimistic.
@wyatt earp  i am too  and really hope they do stick to it. but we can t forget she has her word to day and she did tweet about the black hermione in the teather of a story in the future with harry s kid  that s why i keep meantioning that. it has been said by her. and yet  i hate the idea that she see s hermione as a black  as much as i hate the little mermaid remake.
@dami fides  well that was almost 8 years ago now and she didn t even write that book herself. i think they ll stick to what has been making them a lot of money for over 2 decades.
i m running out of popcorn
i hope she makes malfoy a raving troon!
melonie i know this is a bit random but  there s something going on with alloy in the horizon forbidden west dlc that surprised me i know for sure this is something you d want to cover
3 44 there s also the fact that there are illustrations of the characters on the covers too.
well... they them we us is how demon possessed people speak in the bible. so i guess it sorta tracks... another great vid  melonie!
watch them cast lizzo as hagrid
i m so tired of the manipulative language they use to try to make everyone who doesn t get on board with their agenda out to be evil. claiming that trans people are somehow in danger to the point that they could be wiped out because of one woman speaking her mind is ridiculous  and if you re participating in any way then you re guilty by association. it s pathetic.
because the hogwarts legacy protest worked so well.i really hope it turns into another banger  the amount of salt generated will be enough to supply the whole world for generations.
imma buy stock in hbo now! looking forward to a 256  subscriber growth.
i m don t think this reboot needed to happen either since it s such a huge risk wb is taking.
i see the  bekind brigade are already making online threats against the cast and crew  even the children! their parents must be so proud...
yes  i dont think any of us will forget the hogwart s legacy massacre of 2023. so many lives lost over 1 small little thing. when will we ever learn
i will say the ret cons she did had zero impact on the story itself  as far as i know
i bought hogwartz legacy and haven t got around to playing it yet. also google says   youtube star melonie mac s net worth is  54 million at the age of 32 . i wish i d been a youtuber rather than gone into property and finance. well done!
did j. k. know dumbledore was gay before or after she wrote him getting thrown off of the astronomy tower
i find it funny that the boycotts people want to do is in protest of budlite s trans ads. it tells you how insufferable they are
the show is unnecessary  but that doesnt stop it from potentially being as good or better than the movies. a remake of scarface was unnecessary but still turned out great  same with a sequel to the original alien movie
haters gonna hate.it s what they do
for a group of people who identify themselves by a veritable alphabet soup of letters  you d think they d be able to take the  l  and slink off. it is  after all  the first letter in lgbtq
ah because the last twitter meltdown attack after jkr snd boycott attempt welt so welk last time right     oh wait
reminder that being a troon goes against any religion and is not just offensive but literally stops religious people from existing
i see them weights back there  love it! trust me when i say a home gym is well worth the money to do your thing in privacy. love the video  can t for more streaming of hogwarts legacy with miss biggit  but you get your irl stuff straight first. have a wonderful day!
lol i m not a millionaire  that isn t even close to accurate  but i m responsible with what i earn and save most of it  so i m content with what i have
i never thought i d prefer a home gym  but i have been loving it! i m so introverted  it s nice to workout in solitude
@melonie mac go boom  facts! make them gains!
it s weird. i see comments from you and stephen and andrew and joseph like normal.. but where s otterloop  i like reading his comments. sometimes the things he says to encourage melonie end up encouraging me as well.
@jairik  not sure man  busy with work  lol sometimes i barely get a minute because of extra work too. dude knows how to write though that s for sure. i also love his comments  i think people like melonie should get as much positivity and support as they can get when they have to read a bunch of clown  from people too. sometimes it feels like the only thing that helps you realize there s other normal people too that think the same way.
@lvthor ascending  ur probably right. i just see you guys so often down in the comments showing melonie your support and then when one of you isn t here  things feel off ya know
@jairik  fr  i never seen such a tight community in youtube comments lol. that s what happens when you have someone so based and caring enough to respond to followers.
are you rly surprised to them a 5 yr old is old enough to decide their gender  then an an 11 yr old definitely knows the difference between good and bad
i don t feel a reboot of the books was really necessary either and would have rather had the hogwarts legacy game adapted into a series  but i will be adding cinemax to my cable subscription to watch this.  as you say  really hope they don t emphasize dumbledore s sexuality because in all honesty it has no bearing on the story and there is no point in shoehorning it in an attempt to please people that simply can t be pleased.  it s fine that he is gay  but it s a topic that simply just shouldn t come up in the series.
her-moany ! have you even seen the movies !
i want to see ima bigot in the new max series  that would prove if discovery warner has turn away from woke ideology.edit add on   i m afraid that these activists would do harm to children  especially after nashville.
there s a new sport irl for straight biological men and women. it s called troonhammer 50k. it s really fun and easy. you just do regular stuff that you were going to do anyway  and you score points like so get corrected on pronoun usage  1 pointget corrected on pronouns while not talking to or about a troon  5 pointsget called transphobic by someone who is not a troon  2 pointsget called transphobic by a troon  3 pointsbe accused of trans genocide  4 pointsprevent a troon from grooming a child  7 pointsthere are two divisions  biological men s division and biological women s division. the first person in each division to reach 41 points earns a gold medal  second silver medal  and third bronze medal. the prizes are  each medalist marries their counterpart podium medalist in a real church  buys a house  and starts having babies that will be homeschooled.
its bonkers you re right they complain about something they will never even watch what a bunch of psychos.
i gotta agree that women have the right to have  no weiners present  in the bathroom.  i m a guy and wish i could demand the same.  they make the whole experience worse.  don t even have to see them  just knowing they re there.  there are rules to the urinals that most women don t have to learn about  thankfully.  first  the selection of which urinal to use.  if no one else is there  one of the two on the end.  preferably the furthest from the door so people don t have to go past you.  if someone is there  you pick the furthest from them.   after that  you choose whichever is furthest away from the most people possible. then it s about your sight line.  there are two places you are allowed to look   straight ahead at the wall  or directly down at your own.  never glance over.  once you re done  you have to minimize the number of shakes you give it.  you want to go for one or two if possible  not more  because then you re playing with it.  you will undoubtedly come into contact with someone coming in as you re going out.  at most  a slight head raise and or a muffled  sup   is allowed to acknowledge their existence and avoid bumping into them.  eye contact should be minimized.
they are gonna give free promotion to this one too just like they did to hogwarts legacy..
i love jk and harry potter is a legacy. only the left lunatics can t appreciate true legends. i will be so upset if they change harry potter.
i m all for being realistic about the timing setting. so i am skeptical about adding controversial highlights of the 2020s into the script of harry potter which takes place in the 1990s. even in hogwarts legacy  adding a trans woman as a bartender wasn t very realistic for the 1890s - in which that game s story took place.
my god these people are so petty and want the worl to acomodate to them so much they literall want to go after children.
i would tend to think that jk already was paid for this. and the network is getting paid if you subscribe to it  so regardless if you watch it or not  what you re really paying for is your time. but perhaps you are also giving it low ratings of viewership  for the future to prevent it from having future shows. also the word genocide is very melodramatic in this way. it is an ineffective word in the way it is used here. i don t agree with the person who wrote that statement.  until your people actually gone through it  you don t know the actual effects are of it. as a native american   i understand the effects of it  in a generational concept.  as per a new trio  i don t think jk is that petty towards the main characters that were cast in the old films. i m just thinking aloud.
i think marketing realized who buys actual shit.
btw  the movies were pretty poor. the best version of the harry potter series is  and will probably remain even after the show  stephen fry s audiobook version. fry has become a bit of a tit of late  but his comedy work and audiobooks are incredible.
unfortunately i know a person who has drunk the kool-aid of intersectional feminism. he suffers an inability to parse the details of the rowling issue s . i mean... he s married to someone who is trans. who transitioned after they got married. so. it is a difficult topic for him. and by extension is likely a difficult situation for many connected to that community. thing is.. a man can get his equipment swapped but he will never be a woman. not really. at the very least not with our current technology. in 200 years  sure. maybe. if we develop the science to seamlessly change sexs.but we aren t there yet. i watched a video the other day from hillsdale college. had a woman journalist talking about the figurative brain cancer that is the modern trans-movement. the us went from having 1 clinic that handled sex reassignment surgery to over 300 in something like 10 years. coincidence  i think not. historically women rarely  see almost never  suffered from gender dysphoria. if memory serves women now make up the largest portion of it. add to it. according to the data collect years ago most men aged out of their dysphoria. they either matured into hetero bi men  became homosexuals or in comparatively rare instances cross dressed. this epidemic of youth all claiming to be in the wrong bodies is a dangerous fad.puberty blockers are straight-up life altering treatments with no return option. but they are treated like a morning after-pill. i love my friend and his spouse like kin. but a trans-woman isn t a real woman. a trans-man isn t a real man. also. it is rather interesting that you don t really hear about trans-men trying to compete against biological males  but it is all the rage for trans-women to compete against biological women. almost like there is some kind of advantage. food for thought. i live in the province of alberta  canada. our top  female  body builder is a trans-woman who holds 8 of 9 wins. now. as far as i recall  that person is actual trans. not just saying they are for maximum wins. but... trans or not. a man is a man.
i saw this!  super salty tweets haha.
melonie - the trans community considers it  genocide  is you don t endorse their fantasy  and refuse to acknowlege that they really are women  instead of just pretending to be women. while i m against bringing relligion into this  because the most important thing to remember about relligion  is that my relligion is correct  and your relligion is incorrect  and it will always be like this  no matter which relligion we re talking about   these people are happily oblivious of the fact that they are  pushing things towards a textbook solution. but it won t be the bible - it will be the turner diaries.
i support you melonie and jk
i wonder about this reboot. is jk rowling doing this reboot because she s done with the backstabbing by the actors the ones she made famous and who d be literally nothing without her. and frankly other than emma watson  who btw is losing her appeal fast  are nothing.  even that weasel radcliffe isn t doing all that much i mean his movies are all b- movies at best. so maybe this is rowling s way of disowning them they way they were so quick to disown her   only difference here is of course she s firstly  on the right side of things and secondly  has the means to with new stories to literally ghost these people. while they are buffoons with no real power except limited twitter platforms but that won t keep the lights on and in a few years if the reboot is successful the actors who betrayed her will be all but forgotten.  so its a great move by her.
riiiight. because hbo isn t extremely pro-lgbt in literally everything else they ve done since sopranos  maybe even earlier.these people are out of their minds. all they re doing is pointing out something i now want to watch  just like hogwarts legacy. at least this time  i won t need to buy a ps5 just to do it.
you know what  unalives  trans people  the surgery... once the depression hits when they realise it wasn t what they actually wanted.
as an atheist  the only religious people i have a problem with  are the ones that demand that i believe in their god and live accordingly to their beliefs. thankfully most religious people these days and most atheists  respect the concept of the freedom of religion. we get to disagree and live according to our beliefs or lack thereof. we don t run around converting each others holy places  demand obedience  shame the others for wrong things and thus we can be colleagues  classmates neighbors  friends  family and what not  despite our differences. ...the radical trans activists  that demand i change how i see gender and sex  i use gender synonymously with sex  and declare that nobody else can be allowed to choose to use sex separated spaces and sports  remind of some weird cry bully version of religious fundamentalists. i kind of feel sorry for any trans people that just want to live their lives and not impose on others  that those radicals have made themselves the public face of being trans. disagreement is not hate. it s disagreement. nobody s happiness can be dependent on constant external validation. the world just isn t like that. for any of us.
haha j.k rowling !!!!the queen!!
yea we should not forget jk is a proud feminist so nothing is safe yet also its very clear that the activists truly belive everyones minds works like theirs
i don t mind the whole  dumbledore is gay  thing - there is nothing contradictory in the books  and there was supposed to be more to dumbledore than meets the eye  it also adds to the dynamic of him  and grindelwald  and the whole  for the greater good  idea.but making hermione black is retarded. it is a british tale  about british wizards  and witches. having them look any different than native britons is plain stupid.
bring back evanna lynch for a return role cameo.
jk rowling will always have my respect
rainbow bearded men are not going to like this video.
the movies are fun  but not amazing imo. i d recommend the audiobooks! jim dale does a great job  but if you don t mind british  stephen fry s performance is fabulous. great while doing other things  gym  cleaning  jogging  cleaning  driving  shopping  lying on the sofa  etc. .
maybe there should be an awards system for biological female olympic athletes  going through the actual winners and giving proper respect to the actual winners. doubt the current woke system would bother  so a separate organization would have to go through the data and find the actual winners in each case and properly honor them.
if they boycott hbo or hbo max whatever  they boycotting euphoria which has crazy awards lol  they shootin them selves in the foot hahaha
i think sometimes people forget that jk rowling is very woke herself  and a devout leftist in every other way  aside from the trans issue. the new show will be woke  featuring a black hermione granger  a flamboyant gay dumbledore  and most likely latino weasleys. i m honestly surprised she s not just rebooting the series and calling it herietta potter  with a female lead.
j k rowling  existstrans ppl   it s ma am!
no matter  as soon as they race swap hermione  bye bye show  their 7 seasons will be just a dream  sjw s will win this time
why are we acting like the trans activism attacking hogwarts legacy didn t work. because of their bitching it s probably the most trans aaa game ever. a trans character  male characters can call themselves witches  they can have a female voice. whenever a character is talking about the player  they use they them rather than real pronouns. the attempt at stopping people playing the game failed hilariously  but if we are honest  they got their way when it came to removing real genders from the games.
how fkn weak do you have to be for a video game or tv show or movie to cause so much turmoil for someone lol. you know we got it good here when the worst thing ever is a harry potter show like these people are something else i swear
i love how these activists are only shooting themselves in the foot by crying foul  i am almost tempted to get back into harry potter just to keep the train goingthanks for the video melonie  and have a wonderful day  god bless everyone
all this cause she want to be called a woman.this is what it s all about. all of her  hatred  they complain about.think about it  and how we ended like this.
ill check out the show but i m worried it will be woke because it s hbo
why not write stories pre or post harry potter. i think some new stories are in order.
she does have some very feminist views but they are not enough to make me not like her or her work with charity or literature.
@beretta road chronicles  oh yea i know that lol i ll always support her though hp is my childhood lol
i doubt any of that s gonna happen. jk rowling cares about this story and has always protected it  people forget that. she isn t some random person  she s the creator. she s always had those views  but they were never inserted into this story when they easily could have been.
i dunno if i will ever get into hogwarts legacy given my immense backlog of games  thank you  shitty pcs till recently . even now with my rtx 4080 laptop that i have from lenovo  i fall in the vicious cycle of playing the games that i already played over and over.
@punmeisterone  sorry to hear that  but i have a question  is that tsumugi in your pfp
@natorious the hopeful  nope  a custom padoru i made with padorumaker.
@punmeisterone  oh  neat!it just looked like a character from danganronpa  so i had to ask  i miss danganronpa  even if v3 did us so dirty
they tried that  it sucked.
@wyatt earp  tell better stories  . i don t know
@manny silva  i d rather have the proper version of this story. i love the movies for what they are  but they aren t good adaptions.
@wyatt earp  true. the books are always better. i read the books before i saw the movies. it s the same with the dune series. i read all the books years ago but i must say i did enjoy the recent dune movie that came out recently.
i have just been blocking and do not recommending any person or news source that uses deceptive and dishonest information and language. i really do not want to waste time on bs media and people that just want to manipulate info to serve their own purpose.
reminder  the game still hasn t even been release in old consoles.
boycott hbo for velma if anything
they re going to cast a drag queen to portray peeves.
the irony here is it will be a super woke show anyway.
i don t remember hermione s skin tone being described  but do remember that in the illustrations she was white.
all of the him her types  here in los angeles  look like they re trying for some kind of styxhexenhammer death metal drag look.
some people call genocide just for thinking children shouldn t undergo certain medical interventions and procedures
they are boycotting a game where  so i m told  i ve never played  where you can play as a transgender character. you d think they d support that
melonie sleeping dogs sold well for a new ip but did not reach square target
just wait til my books are mainstream!
42  attempted suicide rate pre and post op.  totally not a mental disorder though.  keep fighting the good fight  melonie.
it s just best not to listen to crazy idiots. just ignore them and your life will be better for it.
your cat is sacred.
im sooo in love with you
even the children xd
these people have so much hate in them. they should try doing something with their lives instead of roaming tw tter day and night looking for people they can harass.
crap when she said the game i remembered the game dam..
wish j.k. all the luck and success that i would wish for anyone.
i think a series reboot is completely unnecessary but i ll watch it if it s not woke. this series is being made for one reason and one reason only  to make warner and rowling lots of money. replacing the big three in the minds of harry potter fans is just a bonus.
i don t maybe jk rowling should do the same. seems like she s on twitter a lot these days too.
@tyler thomas  i guess she has already done something with her life. it s not like she will ever need to work again.
@riki  like i said good for her. i m trans and wish her nothing but the best truly i hope all her successes come to her.
wow  this boycott sucks compared to the budweiser
i still want to know what the ratio is. does one trans die for every dollar jk gets  every ten  i mean she is rich if its a 1 to 1k ratio all we have to do is pay her 999 and no one dies.
jk rowling  breathstrans activists  this is the worst kind of discrimination  the kind against me!
and i haven t even bought hogwartz legacy. i have to wait until 7 15 23 for the switch.
7 00 lmfao
there are so many snowflakes in the world that it is a shock that the entire planet is not totally covered in 7 feet of snow.
race swaps or not hermione and multiple characters in the books were not portrayed correctly in the movies. hermione and the books does not look like hermione in the movie. i don t know if she was black or not  but i know she didn t look like the hermione in the movies.
cole train in the back
6 59 im disgusted with daniel radcliffe and emma watson. jkr made them who they are. its pathetic and spineless of them to conform to the woke mob.
trans activists are mad t...  now i m interested in said thing.

a 8 year old kid is guilty of the genocide against transgender people because he she plays in the new harry potter series wtf someone really need lobotomy asap.
you said some false information about jk rowling and potter. just saying because i know you were never a fan of it prior to legacy  ryan kinel has your correct information
i assume they mean being  murdered  as in  society is driving them to suicide ... but where are the vids of trans people even being harassed  the only videos i ve seen are of dudes in dresses screaming at retail workers  it s ma am!!!
im sure there are trans people who doesn t want jk rowling to die.... i mean i hope so
3 44 thats not what she actually said. it really wasn t . she was directly defending an on stage actress who was a black woman playing hemrione  and she said   quote  but i decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that hermione can be a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm.  rowling also called dumezweni the  best actress for the job.  she has previously said hermione s race was never described in the books.notice the word  can  be. she neverr said that she was. where are your sources of her actually saying what you said that she said  jk rowling is simply an old school actual liberal.
9 32 yes  give that starbucks barista and mcdonalds worker money to a trans organization.
as the god of war   i pull this weight   from hell.  it s not from the seven circles of hell   i ain t saying the brand bc they give a good product.
they them s big mad.
are you going to do a video on mah-ree-oh
i am honestly surprised that it can actually play on the switch s tegra x1.
and she is also right that race  wasnt something discussed. she was on the right side back when she said this  since then things have gotten extreme and im glad she is still a sane woman being true to her own beliefs and simply staying logical.
hermoanie   who is that  lol 3 38
mesogonies feel good because i got back problems
wieners in the women s restroom. you make this old man really laugh out loud.
lol   no wieners present .
it ll totally be faithful to the books except for black hermione.
barely can t wait for sale to support.but 107g
dumbledore will be a black actor or something.  we ll see the video about that then.
whenever a trans woman complains about something just tell her to  be a man  and get over it
true dat
commenting to feed the algorithm
i m available. jk hit me up lol
twitter is not a real place. -dave chappelleand now elon got rid of the idiotic  misgendering  crap. 2023 has just been a conga line of humiliation for trans activists!
3 35 - and that s why i don t like rowling despite this situation. put it on the page first try or don t bother.
i ve come to the conclusion that these twitter activists don t really care about the trans community at all.
harry potter reboot series... ugh... can t they come up with new ideas  maybe a wizard traveling through the magical world doing adventures or things like that  exploring the magical world after the harry potter events  damn... i am not watching the same thing again with just other actors.
i still don t know what rights that trans people think they don t have in comparison to normal people. the only thing i can figure out is that they want the right to pretend no-one else has basic human rights.
stay mad haha
where can i sign up to work on the new harry potter   i dont wanna see trans people hurt  but i m tickled by the idea that it infuriates them to the point of spewing rampant hyperbole.
the show in my opinion is pointless but it doesn t deserve this.
kitty!
let s see how well it will do if they make hermione black.
love you
this is going to trigger the wokeists for a decade
i m on your side with trans people that s part of the reason i think doctor who will be ruined. there s another to. but i m old fashioned at my age even though i m 48.
i think it s too soon for a reboot. honestly. too many remakes  nothing original.
let s boycott a show that won t be out for a couple years!  woke fad will probably be dead by the time it comes out.
@meloniemacgoboom
give my money to a trans organization  that s gonna be a no from me dawg.
i miss when you didn t talk like a radical rightest  and just played tomb raider.
melonie mac n cheese
i don t care if trans people are offended anymore. now i actively root for them to be stressed out and mad . while i live my amazing normal male life
it s crazy because as a blk guy  i don t want to see shows that glorify racism  but trans hate anything that doesn t glorify them.. you re not a gender  you re a complicated sex preference. no shade but harry potter was only ever meant to be inclusive of what jk rowling was exposed to growing up. she named or based characters off of real life experiences or thoughts so whether there were black characters or mexican characters doesn t matter. the beauty of hogwarts legacy is it allows people to create themselves in game. if you were born male and see yourself female  make a female character and love that life. the complex situation of making a male character who goes through a sex change is as extra as gta sex scenes or something and at least that series is based on street activities. maybe the next bully game will include trans commentary
harry potter is the gold standard for reeeeeeeeeing
you used the term troons. how to spell that please
when did this idea men can be women  what s the origin
oh no i just thought of something. watch hbo cast dylan mulvaney as harry as a big screw you to rowling. then all of the activists will end up backpedaling everything they said about the show. watch hbo max make that move.
i can t wait until misandry becomes the new cause celeb.....
i ll watch  but if dumbledore sashays out in a rainbow robe  i m out.  attaching labels to everything is just boring and lazy writing.  good writing lets people find parts of themselves in the characters.
was that neffex i heard in your outro
dumbledore was obviously gay i mean seriously how can people not realise this even in the book s it was obvious.
you spelled it right
jk rowling wouldn t allow that to happen
@wyatt earp  probably not. who knows though
@moktack  i m very confident that it won t happen.
@wyatt earp  hopefully you re right. either way i m skipping it. i m just tired of everything  aside from video games  getting remakes and reboots and such.
@moktack  i love the movies for what they are  but their not good adaptions. a tv show would the best way to tell the story and it would be the most popular show ever made.
@wyatt earp  probably would be. i don t know. i don t trust anything that comes from hbo max either. especially not after the show that shall not be named that starts with v. see what i did there
@moktack  house of the dragon was a very good adaption. the last of us was pretty good  neil cuckman held it back from beint great . they know how to make tv shows. wb is also under different management now with people who seem to care about actually making money. they are desperate for a hit. if they do harry potter right  it will be the biggest tv show ever made. people forget how dominant the movies were when they were coming out.
@wyatt earp  i don t know  i see them as another disney i guess. not a big fan of what they re putting out. it all looks flashy and cool and all  but a lot of the shows aren t really for me. even the new penguin show that s supposedly coming out on there  i m just not interested. and i m a huge fan of the matt reeves batman movie  although it could have been shorter than what it was .
@moktack you can t really judge them because we haven t seen anything from this new management yet. all of their stuff is still in early production. the stuff coming out now was already in the the pipeline from the old management.
i got the song from youtube royalty free library  i don t know who made it lol
@melonie mac go boom  yes it s neffex. rockstar i think
@melonie mac go boom  yup.  it s neffex.  bryce puts all his tunes up royalty-free.  lots of good tunes and some good workout jams.  the guy literally puts out a new tune every week.  you should look him up!
how can they lose there mind  this implies they once had one.
the potter movies are mid at best and the first couple are really childish. it s really not a great binge.
yea i don t buy that dumbledore is gay  she did that for virtue signaling brownie points back then.
this series does not need a reboot!!! why  so they can update it for  modern audiences and sensibilities   so they can raceswapp and gender bend half the cast  oh and ron will be poc obviously cause hes a ginger. and hermione is gonna be poc as in the garbage cursed child play. hollywood is garbage!
i can t wait for the reboot because apart from the first two books the movies where bad.
the actors who played harry  ron  and hermione should kiss jk rowling s ass every day of their lives for giving them the early career that they will eat off of for the rest of their lives because neither of them have had much of any career to speak of since the potter movies ended. but thanks to the potter movie they ll always have money in the bank and that s because of jk rowling. so they need to stop biting the hand that fed them and fed them well.
un-alive ....really is that a thing now
why is it always the female and never the male
i wanna see the headline  trans activists not mad  over something. anything.
i live in a nice place called iwantgirlswithnoweanersville
the transmission people aren t real. change my mind.
i know the bible says it s an abomination  on the one hand i hate how trans people are forcing others to cancel and boycott jk rowling  on the other hand with what you just said about trans people i can see why they are wary.  it s because of people who spread bigotry and hate under the guise of religion.  and here i am  thinking both you and them are a headache.  unsubscribing but i did enjoy your content while it lasted!
truly not mad at all. i m trans and i want to just live my life. if she stands in my way i ll fight against her but as long as she stays in her lane i don t care what the queen of hogwarts does.
how can you genocide infertile people  they already pulled the pin on that grenade themselves.
stay with the original source material. hesitant a tad bit.
any race-swapping  of the main characters and i won t watch it.
these gen z trans folks will get triggered and meltdown if you sneeze too loudly...me  ahhh-chhoooo!!trans thing  you transphobic  bigot!!!
oh noooo less than one percent of the population is gonna boycott   hilarious. we shouldn t be trying to appeal to novelty anyway
as a they them i dont claim these trans radicals.
revelation 20 14-15  kjv   and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. this is the second death.and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
this!!!
youtube will demonetize if you say the real word lol
@melonie mac go boom   wooot!    i didn t know that  my apologies. keep the good work!
you ve already got your wish. one of the main things is drag queen story hour 4k through12. kind of sounds like going full after burner towards sodom and gomorrah.
damn the transphobic baby playing young harry
sign me up i want many copi es
i just really hope they don t start race swapping and putting transgender characters in the show
jk rowling is a hottie lol
leviticus 19 31 regard not them that have familiar spirits  neither seek after wizards  to be defiled by them  i am the lord your god.  1 corinthians chapter 6 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god  be not deceived  neither fornicators  nor idolaters  nor adulterers  nor effeminate  nor abusers of themselves with mankind 10 nor thieves  nor covetous  nor drunkards  nor revilers  nor extortioners  shall inherit the kingdom of god.
these lgbtq feminist ideologies won t survive the collapse of the dollar.
why are they still complaining  i though trans people no longer existed after the genocide that happened after hogwarts legacy.
awh . here we go again hahaha .
i mean... that show is gonna be terrible... don t think many people were interested. or some may be curious  but later we will probably see it go downhill. truthfully  i had no intention to watch it. i almost want to watch just cause of the people saying i can t tho .edit  faithfully telling the story would be nice. they said it ... so maybe  but donno....
hey melonie why are you doing the one eye symbolism and sticking out your tongue when your promoting g fuel
hello look what j.k. rowling has tattooed on her wrists  solve et coagula  just like baphomet.all just minions of satan.maranathaps if you believe that jesus christ died on the cross for your sins  was buried and rose again the third day  you will be saved and have eternal life  this is the gospel  the good news  1 corinthians 15 1-4 1 moreover  brethren  i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you  which also ye have received  and wherein ye stand 2 by which also ye are saved  if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you  unless ye have believed in vain.3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received  how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 4 and that he was buried  and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
proud  bigot
jk rowling is pro trans racial. remember black hermione
world is absolute shit. what the hell happened   the internet destroyed humanity.
finally  i m first!!!!
first
don t really care for harry potter. in fact i ve never watched any harry potter movie in my life. i think it s dumb
it will be the biggest tv show ever made. warners bros is desperate for a hit so they have a lot of incentive to do a good job with it. there s reasons to be optimistic  jk rowling being involved is one of them.
@wyatt earp  nah  i doubt that. tbh even if the first episodes are high views  i don t think it ll last. i know the fans love the show and we like what jk s rowlings has been saying on this one subject... but they ll likely make it woke at some point  and the actors are all different so if the cast is no good then that s another reason... plus generally  unless they plan to make it exactly like the books  it ll probably just naturally go downhill. tv shows always did before the woke issue.well  maybe i m wrong. i don t really like tv shows already anyway. it could be big  maybe you re right. i still don t know if i ll watch it  but  i ll check it out if it looks decent. i never got into the potter series. i seen it years after it was released. even then  i ve only watched most of the shows once... but the game did well cause even people like me who aren t big fans really like that world in game form. i ve played a few before as well. also  i got it since they wanted to boycott it lol
@sliver lining _  it will very easily be the biggest show ever made  just look at the sales of legacy. harry potter is a massive franchise  even bigger than game of thrones.
that s called a wink and is a very common expression....
no hate just wanted to teach you
you re missing out big time
