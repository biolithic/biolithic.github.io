I really love your videos and the message you bring even though we are very different people.  I am a liberal who does not believe in God with a capital g.  despite our differences I agree 100  with your views on wokeism.  I think their message is basically neo-mccarthyism with an even more dangerous reach. I put them in the same sad camp as scientologists and they attack their perceived enemies exactly the same way.     I was security at a bar and a bartender for a total of more than fifteen years. one of my major responsibilities was keeping an eye out for predatory males in both roles.  I laugh every time you talk about feeling safer around  toxic  masculinity than woke male feminists because you could not be more correct. I learned quickly who the real male predators were.  I even like your discussion of Bible passages. I find it more a genuine act of your belief system than an attack on mine.  please keep doing what you do in this channel cause it is so important and know that you have friends and allies in areas you might not think you do.   thanks for the videos,

congratulations on 25k! love your content.  was going to watch a few of your videos to see if they are for me but then you started reading a Bible verse and I subbed immediately.   keep up the fantastic content.,

ya know  Im not a Christian  Im an   innist  or norse pagan  or whatever you may want to call it. just dont lump me in with the  omg my crystals and tarot cards and astrology  wiccan cringe Lords lol but anyway  I absolutely love that you do the daily verse. why  because I believe there s a lot of wisdom in the Christian Bible and in Christian doctrine. I also like to see people be themselves  unapologetically. keep boomin   mel! there s no harm in hearing a Bible verse  whether someone believes in it or not.,

I like your Bible verse section. it is helping me get back into my own faith. take care and keep being you.,

personally I think the Bible verses is one of the greatest things in any youtubers videos I love how you do that at the end,

I like your longer videos personally. thank you for sharing your faith in God. God bless you and your family. duane.,

great vid.. I agree. ...Im always remined of the phrase  remember  a dead fish can float downstream  but it takes a live one to swim upstream. - w. c. fields . so can I encourage you to keep running the race and reading your Bible everyday.,

I admire you for choosing every day to carry your cross and share your faith
