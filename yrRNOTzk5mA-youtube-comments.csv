your  nursing  has moved more from that of the physical body to nursing the spiritual bodies of us followers. you are a battlefield nurse in this spiritual war. keep carrying the word sister.
it s wonderful to see the patriot nurse back in action  i pray you are well  and thank you for everything you do to spread the word of our father and the message of freedom!
you always bring the stirring word  sister! thank you for walking in faith and action...the lord is using you for miracles in hearts! i am so edified by this message today...
thank you for your message. i really fear for our nation embracing evil such as abortion and homosexuality. as a christian i really feel the hatred from nonbelievers for our beliefs. i know it s god s plan yet it makes me sad to see a once just and christian country falling into depravity.
don t go anywhere  dear one.  we are all on this together.  i ve been with my wife --- a career nurse --- all of our lives since we met as children at age 10. we are oldies now  and the meaning of christmas and hanukkah to us and to much of the civilized world is an enlightenment to the world.  praise be to thee  o god. keeo your lamps lit and in vigilance for the coming of god on earth.
you are loved and appreciated patriot nurse and i hope you feel better from all illness affecting you. your work is outstanding  and you are very empowering to me. also  growing up muslim there s a lot that i have to learn as a born again christian and it s very cool to learn about hannukah and the jewish people and faith in this different light. thank you for your time. i hope you have a beautiful  blessed holiday season. you need to rest sooner than later  sis!
a fire message  as usual! thank you  sister! praise be to the most high god  whose mercy endures forever! happy hanukkah
if we don t learn from history  it will repeat itself
happy hanukkah  pn. and many others. what you say is true. keep the faith  brothers and sisters. not long now
i am so thankful to see you back and imparting your knowledge and wisdom to us. i wasn t aware you had been seriously sick 4 times  that no doubt was from traveling and running yourself down  and i pray that this break will allow you to recharge and strengthen your immune system. happy hanukkah  and god bless your faithfulness.
thank you for this timely message! i needed to hear this  for a situation that i have been struggling with. the holy spirit is speaking through you! faith-- action-- miracles.  praying for your healing. blessings!
so glad to see you back. hope that you are fully healed.
i ve been so sad this holiday. went for a walk in the woods this morning and had communion with god. my heart is a little lighter from that and hearing from you.
i have experienced the power of prayer to crumble the walls of evil and tyranny.truly faith without works is dead  god bless the work you do. i pray for and support your efforts.
merry christmas patriot nurse!  let us pray that this evil across our land lifts.
glad to see you back. hard to slow down. listen to your body. take care of yourself. we need you helping to fight the good fight.
great to have you back! thank you  my wife and i needed to hear this message at this time. great timing! god is good... all the time.
amazing message  i always get a bit depressed during this season. i m definitely needed this lesson.
this is such an important message for all believers especially during these days. many feel so beat down by the changes that have happened in this world in just the last couple years even. we need to be prayed up  listen to god and then act on what he says. i think the country is the way it is because so many believers are just praying and cowering. thank you for waking us up! blessings  helen
i confess i know little about the story of hanukkah. for me  it s the season of advent and then christmas. thank you pn! that was a stirring telling and one that fits well the times we are living in.
and that s so different.
meant in a good way.
have to treat the wound wherever it is located.
my thoughts exactly! it s impossible to please god without faith. faith without works is dead...
yes it is isaac. i want to wish you a beautiful holiday. miss you but still love you  my brother. shalom.
@question asker  thank you  and you as well sister! i appreciate you  and pray you have a beautiful holiday and new year as well  much love and peace to you!
okay but where was she
have a safe and blessed christmas  brother.
@the truth  thank you  and merry christmas to you as well!
same here sadly in uk too! it s all deliberate l.
as someone who recently realized that god and satan are real and the bible is the most morally superior and historically accurate  it has been a major shock. sadly my soul might be too badly damaged after waking up so late in life. god is just and will put me in the appropriate place. in the meantime i ll keep pushing forward.
amen  totally agree!
beautiful story  god bless you
inspiring!
career nurse here! even retired i am looking things up and teaching
awesome she worked so hard for the government and its agenda. um...
blessings from florida
in context with her message  it is important to remember that yeshua came to do only whar he could do  death upon a stake  he did not come to do what you need to do!  his sacrifice removed that shackles that keep you from  doing  what the father desires from all of us.  it has been made clear   if you love me  then keep my commandments.
second epistle of john verse 7 -  for many deceivers are entered into the world  who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh. this is a deceiver and an antichrist.
tell that to the greeks  the spanish  the iranians  and the germans.
i pray for your sadness to be lifted
the woods is my church  god is everywhere  but his home is there
all things are possible through jesus christ
@j.robert sergertson  amen!
i don t know if you saw the hearings on the trucker protest in canada and whether trudeau should have evoked the emergencies act. the lawyer actually asked the truckers if they had been trying to use their horns to bring down the walls of jericho.
@america first  would be awesome exactly what needs to happen.trudeau  we all know whom s order he follows - it s of one world.
she celebrates chanukah too. it s chanukah now.
jesus celebrated hanukkah in john 10 22-23. perhaps you should learn more about jesus and why he celebrated this feast.
@charli brown  you tell me charli. you have a willing audience.
the story is about rebellion  sedition  and the savage murder of tribal enemies.
@magpie r.  really  so is that why jesus observed it
you ve been on my mind  i wondered where you have been. prayers up for your health and healing. living in oregon is a far away place from the happenings of the rest of the states. so i managed to get training locally by experts in law enforcement and medical. it s good to see you back.
what an excellent  timely message.  faith   works is what we are called to live  and watching from the sidelines is not an option.  it s good to see and hear you  and i hope your recovery is well underway.  peace!
hope you are feeling better.
we love you pa!! so thankful you are back better than ever.
i m seeing this message lived out once again as i see health miracles in my mom who has been battling multiple health issues over the past 6 years. god is answering prayers through my faith and action and the faith of others praying  for her. our heavenly father is showing me miracles daily  through her recovery. praying  for you and your health patriot nurse.
great to have your strength and wisdom back
blessings to you and your family!  blessings for chat and anyone that hasn t lost faith!
amen and amen. he is so worthy. all we have to do is believe  begin  and then  thank him for the miracle. its your year  our year and my year for a miracle but we must stand in faith  prayer  helping and willing to do what he tells us to  and this country s covenant  built on our founding fathers beliefs  will be shown in many many miracles. do not give up. do not give in. god chose israel- america chose god. those are covenants.  have a beautiful holiday season-docsusun
love you and your messages! praise yah for you and prayers for complete healing!
so good to hear you again. god speed on your full recovery and know you re continually in our thoughts and prayers.
faith   action   miracle. amen.
glad to see you are ok. we were praying for you. we had it and took us a month to fully recover.
glad to see you back.  continuing to pray for your health.  wonderful message today
thank you for telling me the story behind hanukkah! proof there is nothing new under the suni love your brooch. i was just studying mourning doves  literally  before your video showed up on my youtube suggestions. unfortunately we recently found a mourning dove passed away beside our front porch and it s mate perches on the maple tree in our backyard. i tear up whenever i see the poor little thing all alone and i was researching what i can put out to make it s life easier this winter. i guess our father wanted me to really listen to your message.
thank you for your message.  christ conceived on hanuka      born on tabernacles circumcised on the 8th day  crucified on passover buried on unleavened bread -  raised on first fruits--- holy spirit given on pentacaust--   christ will come back on feast of trumpets- marriage of the lamb -       --day of atonement  -        -christ 1000 year rule honeymoon -     -last great day -        on and on  bigger and bigger
great message as always. i love listening. i get a lot out of what you always present. hope you fully recover soon. i m praying for you patriot nurse. blessings from new zealand
thank you patriot nurse for all you do! i pray right now for you and your entire household that all manner of sickness and affliction cease from this time forth and never return! knowing that no weapon formed against you shall prosper and when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord will lift up a standard against him! i pray that 1 shall put a thousand to flight and 2 shall put ten-thousand! i lift up the shield of faith to quence all the fiery darts of the enemy and plead the blood of christ over your life and ministry! in the mighty name of jesus  i pray these things  amen.
just a quick thank you. your timing on this one caught me at a moment in time i needed a little something in my life. i ve  been talking to some younger people about this and was hoping to get those younger ones  a little more interested.  and low and behold. my phone  alerts me and its you. they all watched and you ve explained what i trying to.... never mind good job. you ve a few more subscribers
i knew you before you were born  he knows who we are and what our abilities are when pushed!
she speaks the words right out of my mind. great message i love it.
amen
god go with you pn. prayers.
i seriously admire this woman. keep fighting the good fight! i pray your health improves quickly.
and our faith does not negate our responsibility to act in our self-preservation. i had this discussion with an elder in my church who tried to convince me that i lack spirituality because i carry a pistol for self defense. good to see you back.
you supplied just the words that i needed today  !!! i am deeply thankful for them.
it s good to hear from you  with faith nothing can beat us totally down  without our faith we are weak  the demons are here and i say we are ready for them  stay well  stay blessed  wendy
that was the first time i ve heard the story of hanukkah.  your teaching was very powerful.  thank you.  i m glad you stressed the importance of action to go with prayer.  i think that is often forgotten.
pn  you and reid give me hope. perhaps there are actually young people out there who believe in the founding principles as well as embrace a strong faith belief. sing it loudly!
we missed you so much. thank god you re okay. may you and your loved ones be truly blessed this holiday season. and thank you for all you do! stay based!

amen my sister.we must withstand  for family becomes destruction in the sea of corruption.
p.n. always has a good word  this time is no different. thank you for all you do for our community - christians jewish  preppers  and patriotic americans. you always bring an important message  with words of encouragement and faith in our god. thank youi wish i wasn t so poor so that i could afford to take your classes. i m on disability due to injuries from being hit by a drunk illegal immigrant. i just don t have the money  although i am confident it is worth every penny  and if i could figure a way to make it work in my budget i wouldn t hesitate
it is so cool that you follow the messiah.  i am the only one in my family that follows the moedim  appointed times .  i was blessed to have my eyes opened back at the end of 2011.  i celebrate hanukkah too.  although  we know that is not one of god s appointed times.  as you pointed out   hannukkah is mentioned in john 10 22.  what an honor and blessing to hear yeshua s voice and follow his ways.
love you. thank you for your service!  that discipline needs to be observed on an individual level. no get out of jail free card. no extraction from the lz. no reinforcements. we do it because it s right and just. because we love god we know that following our heart is always the right choiceplease know  in this endeavor of yours that you are timeless  you are perfect and that you are apart of all of us.

keep on fighting the good fight. may you be healed in jesus  name
so glad to see you back and i hope you continue to feel better and better every day.
glad to hear someone preaching faith plus action in a practical way.so many preachers have preached faith without works to the point that many christians think any preaching of works is preaching salvation by works which is far from the truth and why everything is such a mess. they expect god to do what god told them to do.the only thing we get by faith through grace without works is salvation.everything else is by faith through the works of obedience to god s will and moral law.
it s good to see you back. i hope all is well on your end. best of the holidays to you and your loved ones.
the beauty of  you  your soul  your delivery of how to  go forward is at least  masterful.   thank you for  every video you make. if i am having a bad day   i go to your channel and the result of that is me getting off my butt and ending my day in a productive manner with a smile on my face for the reminder  you always instill to live every day with eyes and mind open. now the sun is out and i m off to accomplish. much thanks and love to you!
praying for your health    wellbeing sisterthe world needs righteous people like you to educate    hopefully motivate the massesgod bless us all
patriot nurse  i m praying for you. may the lord bless you with healing and may he energize you. may you be open to the promptings of his spirit  that if he has something else planned for you  that you will go forth with assurance as you make whatever decisions you feel led to make.
good to see you are well. thanks once again for sharing words of encouragement and wisdom. godspeed to you.
i just watched this video  you have touched a nerve with me   faith is sometimes all i have to get through difficult things.  i have felt so helpless today for some dumb reason.events kind of took their toll on me and i had a meltdown.  i went for a long walk in the night which i needed.  i m fatigued by all the negative  the hate by the democrat party i m tired of it.  maybe i m not being specific  but specificity doesn t matter  it s emotion that build and then it erupts.  thank you for your perspective and wisdom.
it s good to see you back making videos again. hope you continue to improve and get better.
our faith demands our action!
merry christmas patriot nurse!  thank you for the words. take care. keep fighting the good fight.
wishing you a very happy and healthy chanukah  patriot nurse and all else that celebrate! be well. stay safe.

you are such a great example of what a woman should try to achieve in character!
great to see you back. god bless you for all your hard work.
thank you for your messages and sharing with us your need to rest and recoup.  be blessed and wishing you the best of health and wellness going forward

just what these ears needed to hear  thank you for reminding me i am not holding the line alone
great message sista. praying  in faith for a 3rd american great awakening. that god would have a his end time harvest like no other. only god can turn this nation around. the church has isolated from the world instead of engaging the world. churchianity has destroyed america. just as religion murdered our savior. we plug our cell phones in to charge them every night  but don t plug into our creator and savior. do that and see what god will do in you. that s right  faith  action  miracles.
patriot nurse   you and your family have a beautiful and blessed merry christmas. yesterday is history.today is a mystery.tomorrow is a gift and that is why it is called a present.

love you kiddo. the only thing i have issue with is the 8 days. when i found out that it is not in the book of the  macabees or any other writings except  the talmud. i stopped with the lighting of the hanukkiah. i will light a candle and celebrate hanukkah. i believe it is a good feast of the people and should be commemorated. may the creator bless you and keep you. may he lift up his face upon you and give you his shalom!
you are so spot on. thank you
the dedication in john ch. 10 was on the last great day of tabernacles.  time frame starts in ch 6 and 7 in remembrance of the dedication of solomons temple which was dedicated in the seventh month.  it also was not  winter  it was the rainy season which begins in the fall the seventh month.  my sheep hear my voice and they follow me is referenced before and after the dedication verse. yeshua did not come back five months later and talk about sheep again.  it was the same time and audience.  from my belly flows living waters  i am the light of the world  healing the blind  the accusation of the woman caught in adultry all are in opposition of traditions and reference to scriptures being read during tabernacles and the non biblical traditions of man that were being done during the water libation ceremony the lighting of the candelabras in the court of the women.  the dedication in john ch. 10 was done in the seventh month not the 12th month and has nothing to do with the maccabeun revolt.  the story of the oil and the lamp was written into the talmud 600 years later.  read your scripture sister and lean not on the traditions of man.
missed you  glad that you are back. i hope that you are doing well.

amen! excellent message  been to church today  hallelujah! baruch atta adoni el elohim  yhvh sabboath  el tisva ott  hallelujah! mara natha yeshua messsiah  amen!
the rededication of 8 days is modeled from the dedication in 1 kings 8. also  if you think about it  if there is contact with a dead body  cleansing takes place on the 4th day and the 7th day. also  circumcision happens on the 8th day  which is a dedication. but you are right  it is not spelled out that it was 8 days in maccabees. there is bread crumb evidence that could lead to that conclusion though. shalom.
ps   two ladies i like on youtube are  rain country   heidioff grid with stacy   doug   stacy they both do herbal remedies recipes if you go to their playlist  .
love you and what you do and what you stand for. thank you for everything!! god bless you and happy your better.

happy hanukkah! we will stand and not comply. excellent message.

coming from a position of faith is essential  a belief in god works that way.  if we don t know how we will win  that is blind faith  yet it is faith.

good message. thanks
the realistic and prettiest woman that walks youtube...youtube.... so sorry for everything you have went thru ma am . i appreciate you and see your mind set . you one strong woman
first  pn  my prayers for your health.  may i suggest that you consider doing some type of classes via the internet   i am sure that has crossed your mind  but they can be helpful  and i have taught a couple of students in the past  to play saxophone  and it worked out pretty well.second  there is this verse  that many  if not all of us know and use for encouragement at one time or another.                              2 chronicles 7 14if my people  which are called by my name  shall humble themselves  and pray  and seek my face  and turn from their wicked ways  then will i hear from heaven  and will forgive their sin  and will heal their land.if you notice  it includes the exact things that patriot nurse speaks of in her post this month.  faith  being humbling of ourselves and praying.  then  action  that being seek his face and turn from our wicked ways  meaning that we have to turn to god and away from our sinful behavior.  and then we will see the miracles come flowing to us  as promised in his word.  it is important that we recognize that the bible contains only two things.  commands and promises.  we are told what to do  those are the commands  and then we are told the good things that will happen when we follow the instructions that we are given  those are the promises.  it seems that we often try to make things much too difficult.  some people even like to make things so hard that they make lists of things that they must follow in order to assure their salvation  such as keep the commandments  or make certain that you don t say certain things  or you have blasphemed the holy spirit  and you can never enter heaven.  that is not what the bible actually says.the whole salvation theme is based upon one thing and one thing only.  the blood that jesus shed on the cross for you  and that blood hides your sins from god the father.  because of that sacrifice  no more does a priest have to sacrifice any animal for anyone.  the blood of christ was so powerful that it was done once for all.  the only thing we have to do is to accept that sacrifice as being for us  and to believe that jesus died for our sins.  i can say that in my own life  i was maybe 9 years old  when i was saved  and i not only felt a difference in my heart and in my way of living  but i felt the holy spirit change me  in ways that i only knew of later  as i saw how he kept me from getting into the things that others got into that caused trouble and danger.  and i was somehow kept away from the desire to sin  while my friends had the desire to go drinking  or to hang out with the wrong people.  this while i was only 9 at salvation  at a vbs  with tears running down my face.  a 9 year old simply doesn t want to let anyone see tears running down their face.  yet i could not help it.  i felt ashamed  of my sin  and yet also heartbroken that i had sent jesus to the cross.  in this time  as we can see  or should see the clock of god s time speeding up  we also should be speeding up in our desire to try and reach any others that we can  and share with them how they can also feel the same sense of freedom  and of peace  and of acceptance.  we also must be certain that we too feel the same.  that doesn t mean that we can t be afraid.  many of christ s disciples were afraid  and tried to hide from being caught by the authorities by lying  or running and hiding.  but later  they became some of his greatest speakers for why they should follow him.  i pray for all of us  patriot nurse  and myself included  knowing that time draws ever nearer until he returns.  i pray that we remain faithful  and that we stay strong  and do the things that we need to be doing  for our families  for our friends and neighbors  our church members  and the unsaved.  and i also pray that we do what is called for in terms of our nation.  i believe that it was god who gave us this nation  and  it is god who will show us the proper thing to do concerning the coming days ahead  what to do in terms of maintaining it.  give us courage to do what ever we must do  be it stand or step aside and let it fall.  we give it to your hands.   thank you for strong leaders like patriot nurse  who are willing to share their knowledge and skills with others  that they may also share them with their groups.  remind us of the lives that our forbears lived before we became so dependent on modern conveniences and so far removed from the land that you gave to us to keep us alive and healthy.  teach us how to once again learn to live with the land  and to tame it  for our needs  that we do not destroy it  but live in harmony with it  and at peace with each other.  may christ bless this prayer  as if he spoke it himself   amen.
pn---was just thinking how nice it would be to know you are doing better....and wonderfully your back....you are a blessing
we miss you and hope you are well...and getting more wellerer every day!  edit   i wanted to start with you look very nice today!
great word sister.

they stepped out in faith at the red sea only when they stepped out did god part the red sea faith is a action on our part god s part is seeing out trust belief in him and carrying out what his will is in the situation! by faith chapter in the bible is uplifting to see what the heroes of the faith have achieved by stepping out! faith moves! fear stands still or retreats be lead by the holy spirit on how to live in the endtimes today is scary but we are here for a time as this  the book of ester is an example.thank you patriot nurse for your youtube channel god bless unjabbed kiwi new zealand

great stuff my dear! ... i very much appreciate your talks!
i praying for you patriotnurse by the mighty power of jesus christ may you be healed and your health be restored in jesus christ name i pray   amen   merry christmas  patriotnurse
praying for your health  please get well  you are so valuable and precious to us.  the foreign power was greece and they even built a statue of zeus in the holy of holies.  they also passed a law that all writings had to be in greek  they basically outlawed writing in hebrew.  the history of hanukkah and of purim are during the hellenistic occupation and were written in 1 and 2 maccabees which were rejected in 100 ad by jewish leaders because they weren t written in hebrew and rejected by martin luther when he left the church.  without the apocrypha  6 books in the old testament  there is a 250 year gap in written history of the jews.  you just have to love and admire judas maccabeus and his family for fighting for god.
god please touch and heal patriot nurse give her strength and please help her romans 10 9  john 3 16  acts 17 30  hebrews 12 14  1st john 1 9   1st john 5 18  and revelation 3 19  i will be praying for you god bless

you are spot on!!
it s good to see you    .
nice!luke 22 35..        35.  then jesus asked them   when i sent you out without purse or bag or sandals  did you lack anything                       nothing   they answered.        36.   now  however   he told them   the one with a purse should take it  and likewise a bag  and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.          37.  for i tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me   and he was numbered with the transgressors.  for what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.  follow up witn proverbs 22 3-                   2.  the rich and the poor have this in common  the lord is maker of them all.                   3.  the prudent see danger and take cover  but the simple keep going and suffer the consequences.

turning and turning in the widening gyre.the falcon cannot hear the falconer.things fall apart  the center cannot hold.mere anarchy is loosed upon the world the blood dimmed tide is loosed  and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned.the best lack all conviction  while the worst are full of passionate intensity.surely some revelation is at hand surely the second coming is at hand.the second coming!hardly are these words outwhen a vast image out of spiritus munditroubles my sight  somewhere in the sands of the deserta shape with lion body and the head of a mana gaze blank and pitiless as the sun is moving it s slow thighs  while all about it reel the indignant desert birdsthe darkness drops again  but now i knowthat twenty centuries of stony sleep were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle and what rough beast  it s hour come round at last  slouches towards bethlehem to be born                                                w.b.  yeats

chag chanukah sameach!!  may yeshua  light of the world and our coming bridegroom king be exalted tonight and every night and day to come!  abba  you delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak  the many into the hands of the few  the impure into the hands of pure  the wicked into the hands of the righteous  and the degenerates into the hands of those who cling to your torah  and we praise you!!  as you delivered your people in days of old  deliver us now from the evil that seeks to exalt itself against you.  lift up our heads and strengthen us by your mighty right arm  yeshua our messiah!!
i use the account of esther and her captive people in persia and what they did to resist pretty often.  the government of the world were put upon our messiah s shoulder by his father and shows that all man made government is limited by the law of the kingdom of heaven.  and  about being sick.  when we fail  often health  and getting old  it is often important to make one s  work  more pointed with less occupation of our time and energy.
to achieve world government  it is necessary to remove from the minds of men their individualism  loyalty to family tradition  national patriotism  and religious dogmas. brock chisholmfirst director-general of the who

absolutely amazing video. the holy spirit has been showing me we are in a season of miracles . i have experienced 3 miracles recently he has also been dealing with me about strengthening my faith .the last important thing he has been showing me is have plenty of oil in my lamp. this was very good conformation and a good word of encouragement . thank you and i pray the lord bless you and your loved ones in jesus name.  amen ..
glad you re back  and stunning  -
we need to make sure we have oil in our lamps! trim your wicks  and be of good courage  the most high is in control. but just as they took up 12 baskets from the feeding of the 5 thousand  let nothing be wasted. get prepared in the spiritual and in the things we need to have to survive. get your food  water medicine  etc. be prepared.!
hrb joh 10 22 and the feast of dedication took place in jerusalem  and it was winter.  also referenced in these versions  aeib  fcab  aeint  kjv   oant   lamsa  and murdock.      from the scriptures 2009  joh 10 22  at that time the  anukkahc came to be in yerushalayim  and it was winter. footnote  cfeast of dedication  during which candles are lit every evening to commemorate maccabean victory over greeks in 165 bce.   such holy days were not observed by messianic monotheistic apostolic assemblies. the roman-babylonian  trinity   pagan polytheism  arose in the 4th century and was never taught by eshu or any of his holy apostles. it is idolatrous. eshu taught that  many will come in my name and deceive many. ye shall know them by their fruits. no evil fruit cometh from a good tree and no good fruit cometh from an evil tree. verily i say unto them thou shalt know them by their fruits.   he commands his holy disciples to  purge out the leaven  and  be a pure lump...unleavened.   he warns us... beware the leaven of the pharisees...   we cannot sit at his table and the table of devils... there are only two possibilities. amen.   be ye wise as serpents and harmless than doves.   thanks for your many helpful videos!!!!!
amen
wow. wow!! i can see  and i feel your annointing!! f.a.m.  sigh  family. thank you!!
lt  andweknow  asks we all pray for becky isaacs bowman to recover from her seious auto accident. thank you!

merry christmas     patriot nurse and all!
a lyric from a holiday special came to mind. and some old enough will remember it   you hope and i ll hurry  you pray and i ll planwe ll do what s necessary   cause even a miracle needs a hand
saw this late but hope you had a peaceful and happy hanukkah.
@ 1 10  you can t take over and subjugate a people who have no faith .every human is flawed  and their flaws become gaps in their perceptual framework  or reality. as their perceptual framework expands  so too do the gaps. and as a function of human survival  such gaps are quickly  almost instantly  filled-in with the best gap filler available at the time  whether that filler is very thick and strong or just a weak and hollow shell  it will be used as long as there s enough information to make a decision and take action in the moment. over time the gaps are replaced with better gap filling material. if there is no better gap filling material available  the old gap filler becomes part of the foundation of greater levels of the perceptual framework and  thereby  becomes more and more difficult  and ultimately impossible  to replace.that is why tyrants want to break down the nuclear family. they want to fill the children s perceptual gaps with a different faith.
ooh  yes hanukkah is very much relevant.  i just realized that
good to hear you.
shalom  nurse!  may this time of rededication not only refresh you but also further strengthen your resolve.
we love you patriots nurse
thank your for sharing that hanukkah is mentioned in the new testament in the book of john  verse 10 22  being referred to as festival of dedication. i ve heard it preached that hanukkah isn t in the new testament...perhaps the meaning if this is that the actual word hanukkah is not used  or perhaps its just ignorance
please forgive me if it sounds like cheap flattery...but..you are truly a rare and beautiful woman. you need to hear that from time to time.tim hendrix
where you been  hope your doing good... blessings sent...
for me as european  watching ppl speak like this is like watching a comedy-movie.its unbeliviable seeing educated man speak like in the medival.
i m confused by your statement.  first of all patriot nurse is a female named rachel.  she s from tennessee and the english spoken in the southeast has its own distinct dialect.  regardless of her speech  she s highly educated and respected.  she s a woman of faith as are many in the united states.  we do not think of it as comedy when so many in europe are going without heating oil this winter or regular citizens in the uk depending on food banks to eat.  patriot nurse provides a great service to all of us if we have ears to listen and not let our preconceived notion of who she is interfere.  i find it shameful that you make such a derogatory statement.
@aspen english  u dont get my point.i respekt her and her work. discovered her channel like 10 yrs ago.but how can such a well educated person speak like a priest  science and religion dont go well togerther.ps  religion is like comedy
@horst g nther ludolf  i can respect your opinion.
@aspen english  i should also respekt ppl s believes  not just the person. but man  did religion bad things to mankind.
@horst g nther ludolf  i can respect that.  belief in a higher being and perhaps not religion itself has done much good for mankind too.  i don t adhere to the beliefs of separating people due to their race  religion or creed.  my family and i try to be kind to all and give because we ve been given so much through opportunities and hard work.  i feel the world would be a better place if they put things aside that divide us and just accept and love all.  it is not my place to judge or not help another in need.
@aspen english  absolutly true.i personaly dont need religion to be an honest and god man. i think religion divides  but i respekt the faith and power ppl get from.

god bless you sugar and yours and merry christmas and happy new year.
i m not jewish but you speak the truth!
too many  believers  think that their faith is shown by thinking and talking about something rather than actually doing!  in context with her message  it is important to remember that yeshua came to do only whar he could do  death upon a stake  he did not come to do what you need to do!  his sacrifice removed the shackles that keep you from  doing  what the father desires from all of us.  it has been made clear   if you love me  then keep my commandments.   and prepare to defend the keeping of those same stated commandments by self-sacrifice.
vengeance is mine saith the lord
for the person that said folks is a southern term  you re incorrect.  i live in the south and it s not a term used regularly.  you can thank pres 44  i use that term loosely  for using the word folks over and over again.  we ll bless your heart in the south but we don t typically say folks.  just an fyi.
neither is she.
she s messianic to my understanding.  i have much respect for her.  she s knowledgeable and isn t afraid to share her faith.

god helps those who help themselves. understand that as completely as you re capable  with all your might in faith and be ready for the miracles. they will come.

the establishment clause protects religion from the government and government from religion.  the secular nature of some religious movements such as falun gong and christian nationalism pose a threat to our freedom from religion.  our 1st. amendment american values deserve to be protected.
awesome story  i didn t know that
the truth will set you free!psalms 91 14 because he hath set his love upon me  therefore will i deliver him  i will set him on high  because he hath known my name.the original name of god in ancient paleo hebrew  ebr              modern hebrew       .the original name of yahusha  jesus christ  in ancient paleo hebrew  ebr              . natsarim were the original hebrew followers of yahusha  branches that guarded the torah. john 15 5-7 i am the vine  ye are the branches  natsarim   he that abideth in me  and i in him  the same bringeth forth much fruit  for without me ye can do nothing.john 5 43 i am come in my father s name  yahuah             and ye receive me not  if another shall come in his own name  him ye will receive.psalm 90 1010 the days of our years are threescore years and ten  and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years  yet is their strength labour and sorrow  for it is soon cut off  and we fly away.mathew 24 1515 when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation  spoken of by daniel the prophet  stand in the holy place   whoso readeth  let him understand  note  i believe daniel was speaking about a thing standing in the holy place  not a person!daniel 12 11-1311 and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away  and the abomination that maketh desolate set up  there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.12 blessed is he that waiteth  and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.13 but go thou thy way till the end be  for thou shalt rest  and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.603 beginning of the times of the gentiles.1290   1 335   2625 2 625 - 603 bc   2022   1  no zero year    2023the dome of the rock began to be built in 688 ad  midpoint .1260 years from the midpoint   1948 when israel became a nation once again.1335 years from the midpoint   2023 which is 75 years since israel became a nation once again. is the temple mount dome of the rock the abomination standing in the holy place    the temple mount dome of the rock says both inside and out that god has no son! if you calculate daniel s number  1335   688    2023 and if you calculate  688   1260    1948 when israel became a nation. if you calculate 1948   75   2023. i remember a passage in the bible that talks about the lifespan of a human being 70 years to 80 years strong  mid point would be 75 . the person that figured this out is  enoch the witness  and now i am always asking myself the significance! genesis 6 33 and the lord said  my spirit shall not always strive with man  for that he also is flesh  yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 120 x 50 jubilee s   6000 years  50th jubilee is 2023 jacob  israel  married rachel when he was 84  1948 israel became   84   2032 -7   2025  jacob s trouble  some say!yah bless!!!
what is tyranny   change is not tyranny.  women winning the right to vote was not tyranny.  ending slavery was not tyranny.  being able to marry who you love is not tyranny.  imposing your religious beliefs on others is tyranny.
happy hanukkah patriot nurse!!
cook your own food  the global disorder need more sheeps without true religion and moral convictions. try homeopathy and this prayer for healing from sor faustina kowalska   jesus may your pure and healthy blood circulate in my his her ailing organism and may your pure and healthy body transform my his her weak body and may  a healthy and vigorous life throb within my his her  if it is truly your holy will . it s also a good idea to pray the divine mercy chaplet  best at 3pm .
yes!! our evangelical christian family loves hanukkah - the truth of its history  their faith  god s response  and latkes!  we celebrate and thank god that their brave active faith preserved them for our lord to rise from their midst
the maccabees didn t do it for themselves. they did it for the temple. so that yhvh s commands  could be obeyed again. not many people want to obey his commands today. modern day christianity says you don t have to obey his commands... so what would they fight for ! ! they have nothing. so they won t. yhvh says to guard the law. the law. that s all that matters to our father.

chag sameach hanukkah  pn. hashem tells us not fear those that can kill our bodies but to fear him who can destroy our soul. all the despots tried to kill our bodies. greece just wanted us to assimilate  effectively destroying our jewish soul  the eternal part of our lives.
wow! oxox
was wondering where you were.
i love hunnaka! i celebrated  with a born again jew!
man you are so beautiful. i ve had a crush on you for so long and i love your videos.
u never seem to say admit what who the real threat is to americans.. hint-- who has the big sticks    its not congress  the courts or a little school board..
... ...pilate said to the jews  the command  therefore thou shalt not kill  3 belongs to you  but not to me.6 and he went again into the hall  and called jesus by himself  and said to him  art thou the king of the jews 7 and jesus answering  said to pilate  dost thou speak this of thyself  or did the jews tell it thee concerning me 8 pilate answering  said to jesus  am i a jew  the whole nation and rulers of the jews have delivered thee up to me. what hast thou done 9 jesus answering  said  my kingdom is not of this world  if my kingdom were of this world  then would my servants fight  and i should not have been delivered to the jews  but now my kingdom is not from hence.10 pilate said  art thou a king then  jesus answered  thou sayest that i am a king  to this end was i born  and for this end came i into the world  and for this purpose i came  that i should bear witness to the truth  and every one who is of the truth  heareth my voice.11 pilate saith to him  what is truth 12 jesus said  truth is from heaven.13 pilate said  therefore truth is not on earth.14 jesus said to pilate  believe that truth is on earth among those  who when they have the power of judgment  are governed by truth  and form right judgment. ...pilate became a  believer  according to the command of jesus christ
why do you have the star of rempham on your menorah
i only have one  question   when she was saying god  is her god is jesus christ   if not  be sober and be alert.
we don t celebrate channukah today  with parades and a show of military strength  we celebrate with a festival of lights. may his light  the truth that is torah shine around the world for everyone to see. ezekiel 37 22                                                                                                                                                                                                                     i will make them a single nation in the land  on the hills of israel  and one king shall be king of them all. never again shall they be two nations  and never again shall they be divided into two kingdoms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              nor shall they ever again defile themselves by their fetishes and their abhorrent things  and by their other transgressions. i will save them in all their settlements where they sinned  and i will cleanse them. then they shall be my people  and i will be their gd.                                                                                                                                              my servant dovid shall be king over them  there shall be one shepherd for all of them. they shall follow my rules and faithfully obey my laws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               thus they shall remain in the land which i gave to my servant jacob and in which your fathers dwelt  they and their children and their children s children shall dwell there forever  with my servant dovid as their prince for all time.                                                                                                                                                             i will make a covenant of friendship with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them i will establish them and multiply them  and i will place my temple among them forever.                                                                                            my presence shall rest over them  i will be their gd and they shall be my people.                                                                                                                      and when my temple abides among them forever  the gentiles shall know that i the lord do sanctify israel.

just read behold a pale horse  william cooper it s the revelation and steps to hell on earth
then you should know that the end is coming soon ....    the red heiffers were delivered ....   first  ones in 2000 years ....  that the euphrates   rivers are drying up...as in revelation ....    and the jewish calender  is on the last days ....    but you   should know all this ....   and that is what faith is all about ...   keep looking up ....
if you want to learn more that you might not be ready to believe go to the god culture..  then watch pastor dean odle.  yhwh yahuah  started waking his people up . and its all in scripture..
ye is right  you  are wrong
hanukkah is not a biblical feast! tradition of man.
study the talmud and study it in depth.look up what martin luther said about it and it will be enlightening.
oy vey
masada
but hanukkah was not one of the festivals that god told moses that the people were to celebrate! the jews made it up and it was wrong! sorry! re read leviticus 23 ff
jesus was jewish  but not anymore.
anyone who s afraid to glorify and broadcast the name o yahweh elohim  cannot be in the kingdom o god where s yall balls
the oil lasting eight nights is not biblical....it s origin is about 600 years after yeshua and is a talmudic writing. the eight days  not nights was from the rededication of the temple and having a sukot redo feast. sukot lasts for eight days. great video though. shalom

ummmm i don t know.
second epistle of john verse 7 - for many deceivers are entered into the world  who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh. this is a deceiver and an antichrist.
hi pn i am a real greek writing from the land of alexander  from saloniki also a jewish city. i grew up in a sect living almost as a jewish man following the moral law never touch a woman only my wife. my wife is jewish in blood from russia. i am about your age. b 1977. i listen to you 5 years now. i wanted to say that i believe that judaism and christianity are one and the same. of course the i mean the real judaism and the real christianity. you cannot be a christian or a jew without loving first hashem and then the one he send the anointed one  his messiah. many times god said to israel  don t rely on egypt or your own power. i will fight for you. but people are people and they are weak they want that extra security they one that they can see. god seems so far away so many times. especially the last 2000 years for israel. for the rest of the world was always absent. why  according to the scriptures god is resting after the creation. also according to the book of job god let satan to prove that mankind can govern themselves successfully without him. all of what is happening now is very carefully staged. is not by accident what happened to jews in 1940 in germany. it happened to make jews atheists and weak. to seak for safety in the god of money and in help from us. the sexual revolution didn t happen by accident right after the war. the target is to create destroyed families  destroyed societies. parents under the influence not to care about the food their children eat or with whom they communicate. weak children with problems with their hormones and their reproductive system and the experts to tell them that they are the future superhumans the hybrids. this political system has its roots in the laboratories of hitler and now the laboratories of usa. they want to integrate machines into human body with the ultimate purpose and hope of transporting our memories and personalities to the internet. yes humans are machines but also independent  spiritual beings. playing with our dna  destroying the role of family  manipulating the climate and using co2 emissions in order to get people away from nature and into the cemented cities more weak and more problematic than ever in order to manipulate them and treat them as robots.  both the most strong countries in the world have this same desire china and the us. trust me putin is the puppet of china. so what a believer can do to stop 2 super powers from colliding  nothing at all. united or not there is nothing we can do. we must trust in god when promise that he will destroy those who destroy the earth. by the way since is my field i must say that global worming is a natural phenomenon that is followed by earthquakes and volcano eraptions and in turn they will cool down the earth till the next global worming period... the cycle is about 1500 years. last time moved mongols to my country and we still have problems with their descendants the turks.
hi beatiful
bump
what a bunch of yada yada right in the beginning... bye!
are you jewish ......if you are riddle me this....why do the vast majority of jewish people hate america ...i can t get an answer from anybody... im lost

...pilate then calling jesus  said  thou hast heard what they testify against thee  and makest no answer  jesus replied  if they had not a power of speaking  they could not have spoke  but because every one has the command of his own tongue  to speak both good and bad  let him look to it. but the elders of the jews answered  and said to jesus  what shall we look to  in the first place  we know this concerning thee  that thou wast born through fornication  secondly  that upon the account of thy birth the infants were slain in bethlehem  thirdly  that thy father and mother mary fled into egypt  because they could not trust their own people. some of the jews who stood by spake more favourably  we cannot say that he was born through fornication  but we know that his mother mary was betrothed to joseph  and so he was not born through fornication. then said pilate to the jews who affirmed him to be born through fornication  this your account is not true  seeing there was a betrothment  as they testify who are of your own nation. annas and caiaphas spake to pilate  all this multitude of people is to be regarded  who cry out  that he was born through fornication  and is a conjuror  but they who deny him to be born through fornication  are his proselytes and disciples. pilate answered annas and caiaphas  who are the proselytes  they answered  they are those who are the children of pagans  and are not become jews  but followers of him. then replied eleazer  and asterius  and antonius  and james  caras and samuel  isaac and phinees  crispus and agrippa  annas and judas  we are not proselytes  but children of jews  and speak the truth  and were present when mary was betrothed. then pilate addressing himself to the twelve men who spake this  said to them  i conjure you by the life of c sar  that ye faithfully declare whether he was born through fornication  and those things be true which ye have related. they answered pilate  we have a law  whereby we are forbid to swear  it being a sin  let them swear by the life of c sar that it is not as we have said  and we will be contented to be put to death. then said annas and caiaphas to pilate  those twelve men will not believe that we know him to be basely born  and to be a conjuror  although he pretends that he is the son of god  and a king  2 which we are so far from believing  that we tremble to hear. then pilate commanded every one to go out except the twelve men who said he was not born through fornication  and jesus to withdraw to a distance  and said to them  why have the jews a mind to kill jesus p. 67 they answered him  they are angry because he wrought cures on the sabbath day. pilate said  will they kill him for good work   they say unto him  yes  sir.

faith or not  i find sacrificing innocent life for  atonement  as heinous no matter your god...demon in disguise
the sin is more heinous.  the atonement was supposed to be repulsive in order to reflect the utter immorality of the act of sinning against yhvh.
