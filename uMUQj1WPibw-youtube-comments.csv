i was in nursing school in 2013   2014 and got out a semester and a half from graduating with my bsn bc i saw how horrible things were in hospitals. the lack of true compassion  care  and advocacy for patients was just the surface. thank god i listened to my heart and soul and got out into a more holistic path of helping others. had i stayed  i would have been fired like so many others for not wanting to bow down to unconstitutional mandates and becoming a medical experiment. thank you for continuing to expose that this industry is not pro life  pro choice  or pro freedom!
my mom recently went to er with a uti. they gave her antibiotic   admitted her then gave her covid booster. right after that she developed afib   was in hospital for 11 days. all this could have been avoided if they just gave her antibiotics.
i m a rn with 20 yrs in critical care. i use to work in a major ny city hospital. this virus and all these mandates has opened my eyes to all the evil.
my wife was in clinicals and just short of graduation when god used a series of events to halt her from going forward.  what we see in hospitals today is appalling.  the lack of compassion  overwhelming workload  and outright incompetence in staffing is frightening.  we know of several instances where hospitals  threw a nurse under the bus  to cover for a doctor s error.  in nursing school  teachers left the room and blatant cheating began.  i pity anyone relying on these  graduates    speaking with nurses on the floor of hospitals  it is evident a majority are there simply for the money.  in our local hospitals  any nurse caught spending time comforting or consoling a patient is written up and criticized. to copy a line from the wizard of oz.....  we re not in kansas anymore.
i was a nursing supervisor for many years and i quit because of all this stuff going on with covid 19 and vaccine mandates and i swore to never do harm to any patients and i would not do anything that i knew would cause harm i refused to do it my only option was to quit that career.
i do long-term in home care  hospice care. over the past  almost  three years i ve seen many of my beloved clients succumb to their mortality in ways i d never seen. this is because of a particular intervention that was introduced to their bodies. i m an enormous observer of the people i care for  and i m telling you  my clients either passed too soon  actively died in the most disturbing ways or developed brand new issues  out of the blue  to accompany their already  failing bodies. it s hard to not be cynical as i recently asked myself   what s the point of taking care of intentionally injured people   it can make you feel crazy. sometimes i m just beside myself  knowing that i m not just providing care... i m also watching an unscripted  unnatural and ungodly set of events take place in the life of another person - and i can t say anything about it.one thing is certain - we officially have customers for life.i apologize for not really contributing anything to this forum. i think i need to move to a farm.
i ve had chronic sinusitis for most of my life and as an adult always treated myself with over the counter decongestants and some herbal remedies. i realized about 4 months ago that i was using more over the counter meds and was getting sick more often anyway. so  i threw all the meds in the trash and purchased more of the herbs needed for respiratory health. i also have been researching and using other natural remedies as well and even without the store bought meds  i m doing better than before...a lot better.
thank you for explaining what is going on in health care.  my daughter is an rn and my son is a first responder and they are clueless.  they think im crazy because i dropped all medical care becausr of my personal experience and research. they dont believe me but prayingyour truth will help them wake up. mahalo from a crazy mom
i have been a male nurse for more than 30 years. i got into nursing for the hope and idea of doing missions work  in particular israel. sadly life goes by.  family  children and  career  . maybe  just maybe these skills will be useful some day. good luck   and thank you patriot nurse for your sacrifices. including losing your fiancee. i know you could have given up  but thank you   you pressed forward.
as a retired nurse of 50 years. don t you think there is a rise in  homeopathic herbal medicine . i myself am moving in that direction...teaching that  is my goal. not only to help myself  but to help others learn how to  care  for themselves. as long as we have access to the  land  god has provided everything we need.
so thankful to hear from other nurses that have seen with there eyes what is happening in the hospitals and testifying online the truth
that was totally the holy spirit at 44 00 45 00... you can literally see the holy spirit speaking through her...thank you for your service to the lord  patriotnurse and all that so courageously and selflessly leaning into him and using their gifts to offer hope and light!
a few years ago i knew a woman who had an infected tooth  she went to the hospital and they treated her but also gave her a flu thingie. she went septic and died a couple days later  she was 44.
we are having trouble even finding kids chewable tylenol  in our area.  america is being taken down from within. lord give us strength to endure in these times.
been in healthcare over 45 yrs...seen it started changing in the early 80s  but it started lated 70s  which also saw...getting rid of the well trained diploma nurse...then came drgs...so much to name...but early 2000s the change to nursing was a business minded  no longer bedside minded  trained...
thank you so much for doing this video.  you are confirming what i am seeing happen all around me.  i am happy that no one that i know that has succumbed to lining up to roll up their sleeve  has fallen ill  or worse.  i wonder how long they will be okay.  i saw how bad the local hospital s care was when my mother fell in 2017 and broke her hip.  there was no one anywhere!  they were very slow to give her pain meds and trying to call or even locate a nurse was futile.  we had to watch our mom suffer with no way to help her nor explain to her why we couldn t get her relief.  there has been a long-standing problem with the nurses being treated poorly at this hospital.  it used to be a non-profit but was bought out by d.u  k.  e.  and now is for profit.  the care has gone down to deplorable levels.
i work in the dental field and i couldn t agree more on paper charts. 100  digital is not the way to go for multiple reasons. safety and security for one  and the patients  health are just a few  too many things are missed when you can t physically flip back through the file.  luckily this is not the case where i work since the doctor is on the same page but i ve seen it too many times.
in 2002 big corporations got private docs to go under their umbrella by dangling all the so called positives of not having to keep up their buildings maintenance  hire fire or deal with staff issues  no more rounds in the hospital ..hospitalists we re taking over care in the hospital admissions in the early 2000 s including icu so that worked out well for big corp.then everyone  including those once private practitioners had to go to online charting in 2008. many older doctors retired early because they said weren t going to sit and chart in a computer when they should be looking at their patients  not a computer screen. i m a retired rn and so glad i m out.
thank you so very much patriot nurse i have several health issus and i suffer quietly at home.i have been to at least three drs. and 7 specialists still no better the government has truly hog tied the drs. hands but also they just look at me and say take this and feel better. it actually makes me worse so  i suffer quietly at home in my bed.i have seem up close how there is no compassion or empathy whatsoever from the doctors or the specialist especially their assistance. you my lady are one in a million
it s a never-ending fight against the forces of evil.
i also walked out of nursing school in 2018  not long before everything at all. i really dodged a bullet too.
but we need the nurses that are of  old school  minds related to intelligence  education  educating and caring about and for others.  i ve been a nurse for a long time  and we can t allow the profession to be destroyed.  medscape nurses had an article recently about how graduate nurses were failing the licensing exam in record numbers  and there is discussion about making the test easier.
@zhippidydoodah9190  but remember it is only the well-educated boat rockers  those brave enough to stand up and will not stay if it means being part of injuring patients that will truly help stem the evil that has taken over the system.    yes  but the state boards have been in process of dumbing down for awhile now.   physicians say similar happening in med schools.
it s really discouraging how isolating it is to stand up against all of this when family members and people around you all think you re crazy for it. i really considered going into occupational therapy but sadly discovered that field has the same problems. i had a v injury from the gardasil many years ago and developed an autoimmune disease. i was really sick. since then  i d stayed away from v s because of my experience.what i d found out  even before the jab  is just how hard they make it to get out of shots. at that point  i said no to it all because i didn t want to put time  money and energy into a field where you have no medical freedom. i am so saddened and discouraged by the jab and to this day  people look at me like i have no ambition and am looked down upon because i didn t go along with it. your opportunities are limited in this world. i m weary and ready for jesus to return
.. ...the lord answered and said   o peter  it was necessary that you understand the parable that i told you! do you not understand that my name  which you teach  surpasses all riches  and the wisdom of god surpasses gold  and silver and precious stone s   he gave them the pouch of medicine and said   heal all the sick of the city who believe in my name.  peter was afraid to reply to him for the second time. he signaled to the one who was beside him  who was john   you talk this time.  john answered and said   lord  before you we are afraid to say many words. but it is you who asks us to practice this skill. we have not been taught to be physicians. how then will we know how to heal bodies as you have told us  he answered them   rightly have you spoken  john  for i know that the physicians of this world heal what belongs to the world. the physicians of souls  however  heal the heart. heal the bodies first  therefore  so that through the real powers of healing for their bodies  without medicine of the world  they may believe in you  that you have power to heal the illnesses of the heart also. ...
excellent comment jasmine
there was a program on shortwave being broadcasted from wwcr  christian radio also on internet  nashville tennessee which had a master nurse  joice reilly  that had done a interview with a 90 year old physician which had a great memory and he said this that in the1920 1930 1940 where he worked there was allopathic  holistic  orthomolecular hospital s which cured patients at a ratio which was better than just allopathic ones and what happened is the pharmaceutical industry payed off the american government to close them down so standard medical treatment would profit more  there were four or five and of the last left was the samuel hospital in pennsylvania.
@jagdtiger9287  many moved to south america.
@cyn4given2  doctors and nurses
did she give permission for the boooster
could she have gone to an urgent care instead
did she give permission for the booster
i hope they asked her first!!
@shirley louise  did they ask if she wanted the clot shot
eventually  i found out it s not a virus. it s worse.
@garrett621
ditto
@jess-kn8vl  exactamundo...
@garrett621  what do you mean
@kat4256  we ve been lied to  again . but it is not a virus that made people sick. look at the symbol that  jess  typed in her comment. that s what it is. not trying to be elusive  just trying not to be censored.
@garrett621  radiation
@garrett621  these injections destroy the immune system
@garrett621  dr christine o grady  fauci s wife
@garrett621  she worked for the nih
@garrett621  she was chief doctor over bioethics
@garrett621  she stated it was unethical to expose humans to a live virus. that s why she skipped the  challenge test  part of the trial
@garrett621  in previous animal studies of mrna the injections initially looked great  antibodies increased sand the animals did well
@garrett621  then the   challenge test  about a year after injected and the animals all
@garrett621  from ade  antibody dependent enhancement  it destroyed the animals immune systems
@kat4256  all of it is patented biosynthetic lipid nanoparticle parasitic technology.
@kat4256  which is why all the antiparasitic treatments were banned from use  because they worked...
@kat4256  i won t be surprised if everything i wrote you was blocked.
@garrett621  i believe dr robert young and karen kingston also found similar.
@garrett  i see 6 of your comments so it looks like they are all there.
@sl4983  kingston has discovered all the patented technologies  which are available to the public. beyond unreal.
all kay says is verified and easily researched.
this is what i thought about two years ago with the initial roll out of the vax. it was to create drug addicts of a sort that needed   fixed  for the rest of their lives. the constant need for boosters seems to bear this out. however people catch on to that. i just wonder about their natural immunity.
yes  it s more than just medicine although for doctors and nurses to be part of this atrocitie is terrible but the whole planet being involved by corporations  the unfamily friendly film industry music industry and the world economics forum plus the builderbergers  it s more than just one thing.
@garrett621 that s the radiation sign or looks like it.
the horrible thing is the malpractice that is done and nothing is done about it even if the doctors themselves either understood the treatment was wrong or when the patient was by all means mismanaged and payed or bribed physicians  i am not sure that nurses get bribed  which take cash or material goods to promote pharmaceuticals wether it works or not and refuse nutrition or allopathic means of healing or though some have been caught taking themselves and their families to holistic practices.there are some physicians and nurses doing both allopathic and orthomolecular medicine but not that many.was not medicine supposed to be healthy mind and body which ever way that was beneficial   now it s just money  big pharma  at least here in the states  and a great place to retire.
@garrett621  the other symbol which is toxic is the ama insignia.
@jagdtiger9287  agreed
what
massive cheating at the nursing school i walked out on also. they were caught and allowed to continue in the program and i quit after that.
@kdavis4910  it seems to be widespread.  the school my wife attended is  supposed  to be  one of the best.   another issue is hospital staffing by foreign trained workers with clearly substandard skill and only given two weeks  orientation  before caring for patients unsupervised.
thank you for being an honorable and compassionate person  god bless you!!
thank you from the bottom of my heart the hospital absolutely murdered my son
@eringreene-rettig4818  i m so sorry for your loss.
same here...rn for 25 years
@eringreene-rettig4818  oh no
you  sir...are a real hero...thank you for your service when you were functionally active...medicine is not an experiment
thank you for doing what you are doing.  i am sure that you have seen many things happen to people as a result of the wickedness.  i feel so very fortunate that everyone that i know that got the  special juice  are doing okay.  but for how long
case mgmt rn...seeing the same thing!
oh my goodness... what happened that they died in disturbing ways   how so if you mind
@sharibuckler8529  can you elaborate at all please
i also worked in homecare  not hospice specifically  but you know these folks aren t working toward improvement
@sl4983  i don t think i can re-traumatize myself by going into the details. what s done is done.
@garrett621    you can lead horses to water  but you can t make them drink. or make humans think. i think your comment is an important contribution. so  many thanks. hoping for better days. it ain t over.
thank you for posting this. it isn t just the  magic juice.   my dad passed in 2003. he was under hospice care. he had an oxygen tank etc and was kept comfortable till the end. my mom s situation two years ago was completely different.  hospice  hooked her up to some kind of pain killer and just left her unconscious till she died a few days later. it reminded me of when we take our elderly pet to the vet and have them  put to sleep  only in a slower process.
what we see is a medical system not about health care but  sick  care.   the goal for a patient with say  diabetes   is long term management of that diabetes so they need doctors and big pharma for the rest of their lives.  most are never encouraged in weight loss  nutrient-dense eating  exercise  etc.
@garrett  those of us in case mgmt. understand completely without you having to say more.   we are watching pure wickedness all for the love of making as much profit off each patient as possible.
@garrett i m just curious if what you are saying does it have to do with the prescription drugs or just the clot-shots
@buckie48192  the shots. but stay away from all this new prescription crap  too. made at a moments notice and loaded with crap.
@michaelshapiro1543  this is because way too many people are getting information from the mainstream press which covers up or won t discuss certain issues because of political correctness...they need to go to other sources wether it s shortwave  internet  magazines or going to alternative natural doctors for a different perspective on health care.
i hope you re also using a netti pot.
so what do you use...desparate
@serendipitygirl6150  yes  i am.
@rosannadana2922  the neti-pot  dr. christopher s sinus plus blend  and my mom gave me a book titled the one-minute cure by madison cavanaugh. i recommend you read that book and try the cure if you find it could be helpful.
@rosannadana2922  i also watch dr. eric berg on youtube and he has several good remedies that i have found to be helpful.
@thesilverlining8361  yes!
@thesilverlining8361  berg is a scientologist!
i am trying to do the same thing--drop medical care.
@travelinggirl6681  do it! i dropped my medical plan and receive the money they use to take out  so i use it instead for only  natural medicines of my choice. i still have a hospital plan but i would never go there. be safe  be healthy  be smart! aloha nui loa
how can they not see
@sandramae1772  they dont connect  the dots... and they obey their authorities who are still lying about  health care. i pray for them daily
@thingschange6963  yeehaw!
i wonder how your daughter  the rn does not see what is going on  do you think perhaps she is in denial
@buckie48192  i guess....
thank you  3
i was a volunteer fire rescue  looked into becoming a nurse in 1999 saw things going south. i hope no i pray we don t need our skills.
to help the christian and arab kids  who through rocks  that get shot
@pixiepete6431  it s her story and you can find it  but it s her story. i don t want to have this ss gossip.  i can only say that she could have given up  but she pressed on.
@apexalpha4947  to all. jew or gentile  arab  palestinian   for god so loved the world. i have always appreciated my time with both groups of people in israel.
@ga6381  yes she did. and a wonderful woman she is.
@thepatriotnurse i m new to your channel....i had no idea about what s new ruined above. i m so sorry. you are an angel among us and deserve someone who sees your amazing heart and celebrates it! i m binging your channel. thank you  thank you  thank you!!
are you still a nurse   do you have any advice or tips for us   thx
@sl4983  yes  i am still a nurse.. first  find someone locally you trust in health care and get a true assessment of the hospital   er  and physicians  surgeons.  key  do this outside of the facility.  most health care workers can not give an honest assessment without jeopardizing  their livelihood.  second  create a network locally communicating and supporting these facilities and workers.  create a  parallel system  to combat disinformation   such as   he is a great surgeon  doctor  . .health grades can be found on the internet as reviews. thirdly   look for someone like patriot nurse to learn alternatives   such as herbals and even veterinarian medications.  some are equivalent to human antibiotics at less cost. train in cpr and basic first aid.. buy a first aid kit or create one. lastly   never pay what the hospital or doctor s bill is. everything can be negotiated. just make a payment plan and ask for a discount.  never demand.  kindness goes a long way.
thank you
all that for an infected tooth--that is awful.  i feel bad for her family.  at least a dentist wouldn t have pushed the flew thingie.
@ruthmurman7125  im so sorry to hear that
look into what tylenol does to your body. you may be glad you can t get it.
tylenol is one of the deadliest otc medications on the market
children s advil is good but be moderate.
what happened to children s chewable aspirin  you could crush it between two spoons add some juice.
@sl4983    there is also a shortage of children s ibuprofen as well  best to stock up if you find some.
agreed that going digital is just ripe for hacking thus compromising safety   security for patient charts   other impertinent info. i worked at a podiatry clinic as a medical assistant for a short season. the office had their ehr system hacked into   held hostage for a large sum of cash. as a result  the office incorporated a nightmare of clocking in out system as well as being able to get into their ehr system.
started early 90s  even 80s
i worked 42 yrs as a professional nurse. i practiced for 20 yrs in hospitals  med-surg floors  icu  cvicu  er   then 22 yrs as a family nurse practitioner. i quit   let my licenses lapse because i was being told how to practice  how long i could spend with ea. patient   less than 15 min.  the drugs i could prescribe. then how many minutes to shave off ea. encounter   down to 7 min ea.  it was all about more visits more money. we were delivered hundreds of flu shots and everyday emails about how many flu shots each clinic had given. it was not about care it was about money money money. many of the other practitioners never left there chairs just typed out orders. i always examined my patients listened to heart and lungs   felt abdomens and talked the whole time and listened . found domestic abuse  elder abuse victims  suicidal ideation in patients  severely depressed patients  i was counseled for wasting time. but found meningitis  pending stroke  heart attack  cardiac arrhythmia  pneumonia ect! i was appalled and so disheartened. corporate medicine is not medicine at all it is a killer.
understand completely!
@thenpheler1  oh my gosh...the same thing....its volume. no matter what the patient dealing with...i had a woman with chest pain that needed a heart cath..she sat there a bawled...why  because week before she held her dead newborn grandchild..i got told i spent to much time with her...and on it went...bottom line it boiled down to the managers stats for her bonus...we all have our stories and it makes me sick...
i m sending you prayers for healing.
and it seems to be getting more difficult every day
she is a true warrior for god s people . she has a amazing calling from our father in heaven. you gotta love this lady .
thanks for speaking out about everything in healthcare and there privacy and security issues in the healthcare sector!   we have too change direction in this country!  stay faithful patriot s!!!
the goal of obama care was actually a success. shorter lifespans due to poor care.
this was great pn  i hope you do more collaborations with like minded people  we all need to hang together in these perilous times  or we would surely hang separately.
i had several rounds of antibiotics for tonsillitis as a young childhood and started having digestive problems by 5 years old and the problems have never left me....now i m 57. last time i took antibiotics was in my 20 s when i started learning about the detrimental impact on the gut microbiome.
i love the patriot nurse! have followed her for years. she is wise beyond her years and her unwavering faith is so encouraging. god bless
i took the medical preparedness live training and cannot wait to see you at your debut herbal preparations!!!!! see you in a week!!!
thank you for this video.  i am an rn- but was medical  for years starting as a cna   1971  and then a-medic in the us army.  i love to hear you explain what i often cannot.  my children think i am a walking pharmacy  not for meds  but for things you might need normally.  however  they misjudge me in most things  as prayer and critical thinking come first.  even  a   father  or  saviour  you take this it s beyond my ability  works or  guide my thinking  please.   my family know i do not trust healthcare as i once did.  sadly  my family still does  although my hubby did not take the jab  though my children would not speak to me because he listened to me. . i am glad he did  because my kids have had cv for the fourth or fifth time now  while we have not had the flu or a cold for the last two years.   we are late 60 s i do have 3 medical kits in my house.  i have some antibiotics and purchased meds  but not a lot.  i use more herbs  roots  and activated charcoal.  i was medically retired in 2009 after being seriously ill.  i have been doing research on herbs and things since and now have a greenhouse where i grow my  meds  and fruits and veggies. i also raise chickens.  we buy our meats from local farmers  though my husband does love the grocery store.  my diet is extremely restricted and i find it helps the health.  i did go to hospital  once for a fall down stairs and a broken humerus  but my time in the er and in the doctors offices were limited.   i only allowed the 911 call because  i could not extricate my arm from the rails  nor try to rise without passing out. . i switched doctors knowing who was okay after first visits. the paramedics were awesome!  but i will treat any minor injury of my family.  there is a big question that has to be made with folks not trusting healthcare    when or do you at all call 911    for me  i have given instructions to my family not to call for me.  i do not desire to be tortured to death  nor wish medical field plus government to have access to my information.  i have already been hacked once for using insurance authorised oxygen.   yes  someone used my info to set up an account.  i am really sickened by what evil has done to healthcare!  once caring institutions  many health care facilities have become deathtraps.  and the same system took away nurses as advocates!  i will tell you  i do give healthcare advice based on the old path  if they are  agreeable   it s their choice and i do first aid care on the spot if they agree. . i helped a woman with a dog bite and a heavy set man who fell and cut his hand.  i told them both what to look for if things get worse  or they question what i did.  both did very well afterward and let me know.  if i render help  i always give my info.   the thing is people usually really appreciate a good samaritan.  i have only been refused once and he was a friend.  i have always responded to accidents if there first  which was at least yearly when i was practising.  most of us rn s are teachers  but it is sad now that the science   has changed . i am grateful that there is a sister like you teaching  patriotic  and spiritual.  it is not a coincidence that in hebrew  the language of angels  the word for sister and nurse are the same  achut      .  yah bless and keep you  make his face to shine on you  and bring you shalom!
this is such an important topic.  i ve worked in healthcare for 33 years.  i m so profoundly angry and disappointed in my fellow nurses and the  police state  healthcare has become.  teaching   folks to speak carefully and tread lightly is essential.
alamance community college in nc is training rn s at the associate degree level and more lpn s. i spoke to a nursing instructor directly.  expecting fewer bsn  therefore  msn prepared rn s as the field is being depleted with attrition  retirement and changes in career due to the circumstances inherent in the medical big pharma industrial complex. i m an  old school nurse  1970 s for undergrad and 1990 s for advanced practice.  out of practice for years due to rare diagnosis and failing health  environmental toxins root cause . meeting soon with lay individuals and professional nurses in nc who want to create a new system of real health and healing. there is hope  and  it will take diligence and hard work. god help us all!
excellent discussion! as a class attendee in keller  tx in 12 22  i can attest to all that was stated in this video!
nothing short of outstanding. thank you for willingness to do this interview. i hope you do more as your schedule permits. i was on the fence about purchasing one of those antibiotic kits  now i m not and will save myself some money. god bless you always patriot nurse.
the statement  if is ain t  broke  we ll fix it till it is couldn t be stated truer
thank you  patriot nurse about sharing to us about access to our medical records and the high cost of care after obamacare
had a gov t operation conducted against me with data accumulation  and there are others this is happening to also. court records  medical records  prison records   juvenile records  they conduct these operations in court rooms  over the internet and in society. had a judge attack me with an absurd domestic relations case for a kid that isn t mine  the mother signed the birth certificate with my name 16 years ago   used a noise campaign  loud vehicles  sounding off train whistle constantly  knocking on my windows and using informants targeting me as i lived alone in an apartment. pennsylvania medical and psychological system is a complete and total criminal organization  and has been pushing false psych diagnoses for many years.
praise the lord for leading you to helping  people with your priceless knowledge! thank you  patriot nurse! i ve been watching you for about 10 years.
also  i have learned that a happy gut helps the brain to be happy.
makes me to never seek medical care again. very sad and scary.
new to your platform.  very much appreciate your videos.  continue the great work.  blessings
my mother described the same sentiments about 3rd party involvement in the education complex...even as a teacher s aide  she was doing the work of the fully credentialed teachers that were always  attending meetings ...
even the rollout of obama care is questionable. nancy p. with a stack of papers in front of her . stating   we must pass this  to find what s out what s inside of this   ...
i wouldn t have been surprised if they said  if you have federal healthcare you must get hokie pokie or you will be dropped.  they may have i don t know.
@ja2808  luckily  no  they didn t. many people are disabled and there are lots of disabilities advocates. they would have gone wild and other financing options would have caught those wrongfully dropped in my area.
years ago we were traveling across pa and had to take my 3 yr old to emergency room for a fever at night . about 12 years later received in the mail a receipt for medical care someone had been receiving in her name  probably for years . frightening
you sound like a targeted individual.
@americafirst9144   i am  and i m going to do something these courts  many police officers and many people don t do nowadays  tell the truth in front of a jury.  they included way too many people  there s no getting out of this one. americans are going to want to know how these operations put communities and people in danger
i remember seeing an interview with a centenarian.when asked for the secret to such a long and healthful life  he said   stay away from medical institutions! at the time  i thought it was a rather reactionary and strange answer.  after the last 2-3 years in particular  i realise that he couldn t have been more correct.
oh  thank you for this! i just love finding your nuggets of knowledge. and to be paired with another awesome channel that i love. wonderful!
i ve seen medical stuff and potential mistakes. this is so valuable information. i have so much to say. thank you patriot nurse.
thepatriotnurse i ve had my jase case for almost a year now it s worth it s weight in gold. i ordered it after my family doctor refused to see me because i was a pure blood. god bless.
always love your expertise    insight into soo many things! ...thank you so much for posting these videos. love ya and i pray for your safety  health   continued wisdom.
thank you patriot nurse for all the work that you ve done to teach people to be self-sustaining in all areas of their lives.
the patriot nurse  i absolutely love the big family homestead.  i remember when they were in ohio.  glad you are doing a collab.
as an rhit  and someone who worked in release of information for years  i hated seeing other peoples records. i wasn t a nosy enough person to care or want to care. it really is an integrity thing. a woman i went to school with had her records compromised by her ex-husband s new wife  who worked as a nurse in the hospital where she was being treated. it s scary to think so much information and the safety of that information is only as safe as a person s integrity.
great interview! thanks patriot nurse
this period right now is her very well deserved vacation and here she is with a true servants
love you patriot nurse!! been watching for ten years..thank you for caring so much about humanity..

well done good and faithful servant!!
that was an excellent podcast  thank you so much!
if you live in michigan s upper peninsula your only choice for specialists is wisconsin so like in my family s case we are traveling 6 hours one way for my way to see a specialist in madison wisconsin. so you travel 6 hours down have a medical out patient surgery and as soon as you are done your back on the road for the 6 hour trip home then you add on the increase in gas prices and these trips kill us financially. to all of these people that think we are lying and it s the same as in these cities you have no clue.
great job patriot nurse! enjoyed it.
preach it  girl!great security speech.your classes are great for networking.i ve been blessed by the practical use of the classes  and have utilized the skills many times.you are a gift. thank you for sharing.
a course or round of antibiotics  not a dose. a dose is 1 tablet  capsule  etc. the antibiotic kits have full course. for example the contingency kit has 28 doses of amox-clav 875-125mg.you can also get a kit from contingency medical or jase medical.i developed a severe infection in my jaw last week and haven t been able to get in to a doctor still on monday.  i am 65  with much advanced charcot marie tooth  peripheral nerve disease and secondary osteoarthritis  etc.i feel from the treatment i get from the medical community they are waiting for me to die. i have not had their jabs and have not had c19 at all. i tried swishing   saline sinus spray  peppermint tea  salt  peroxide    every home remedy i knew of. i live alone and don t drive and would have potentially become very ill without the availability

excellent interview!  if you ever have the opportunity to take pn s in person classes  do it!  i took her 4-day class in august and was blown away with the information presented and the hands-on experience.  not for the faint of heart because you will work!  next week i will be taking her brand new herbal class in knoxville.  i can t wait for  i know i will leave equipped with knowledge and skills at a deep level.
hi all love this channel and the information provided. it s so appreciated. i know no one can probably really answer this  but do you think i m being super paranoid by not getting my blood drawn for a panel in preparation for a routine check up  i m a veteran so if i don t see someone every two years they boot me out and i have to reapply financially  so i d like to stay in your system in case of an emergency.thanks so much if anyone has any insight. god bless you all. the king is coming! maranatha!
would you give out a list of medical problems and put opposite  across from it  the natural medicine ect we should take for it....that would be a huge help for us all..thank you
patriotic nurse is awesome -- been watching her for years -- great advice and she tells it like it is.

stolen health data can also be used to fraudulently get prescription drugs that the real patient legitimately needs
great episode thank you all!
some of my favorite youtubers! great interview!
since september 1st 2022 i have overcome sleep apnea and gerds and probably have lost 40 to 50 lb  getting rid of comorbidities is way better than rolling up my sleeve i believe.
awesome blessings from alaska ... thankyou patriot nurse
a young lady died in the  er in nova scotia canadashe waited 7 hrs and passed she did not receive care.
one root canal shouts down 63  of your eamsines system pulling your wisdom teeth is turning your off on switch for dealing with stress   looks like we all need faith at this point
it used to be standard that whatever bacteria made you sick was tested to which antibiotic works best against. then testing fell under the table   take this  if this doesn t do then you get another  may be a third..... no wonder abx resistance grew exponentially.  dumb idea to just take one  glad it helped you for the time being.
try an iodine mouthwash
@markaamodt1508  so what s he supposed to do
@sl4983  your sickness is you all think you have this right to rule and irorn rod  that b.s. wrath and vengeance is the bypoler god of wrath and vengeance is the devil the 2 egd sword is love your neighbor as your self and love the father with all your might heart soul and mind and there s a new commandment jesus said as i love you you all so love one another
@sl4983  when the father s will is your law you are not in the kingdom  but when the father s will truly becomes your will then you in very truth in the kingdom because the kingdom has become an established experience in you        when god s will is your law you are a knoble slave subject s   but when you believe in the real gospel jesus commissioned the diven sonship my father s will becomes your will and we come to the high position of of free children of god liberated sons and daughters of the kingdom

@sl4983  salvation is by the regeneration of the spirit not by self righteous deeds of the flesh you are justified by faith and fellowship by grace  not fear
@sl4983  and for me i only had teeth problems in the past because i smoked weed   fear   drank too muck beer   poisoning my temple more fear    stop doing that and learn to be part of the vine no more pain teeth all work good today experience is ever thing anyway peace  be with you
once again awesome words of wisdom!
the stated goal is always the exact opposite of what they say.
my doctor would no longer see me because i did not get the covid vaccine.
great show. loved it!
my insurance company is now hounding me by telephone with a  health coach.   that s a first.  i have no need for a coach and do not wish to discuss my health with anyone.
just watched on big family homestead...haha!!! love it...thanks a mill...
i think the rain they all about the antibiotics is that she did mention needing an oral surgeon.  when you have a tooth infection you re likely looking for antibiotic period.
super great video. love you patriot nurse.
i haven t finished watching the interview  but interjecting here because i believe our free market to alternative therapies is being limited for sure!
awesome interview
i can t love this enough!!
been a while since i ve watched a pn youtube video. nice to see she s moved on from the  civil war  conspiracy. when one door closes...
ty for everything u talk about..
yay!!!!       love this sooooo much!!!!
my several stays a a hospital recently   ---  the nursing staff were spending just about all their time on the computers in the hallways.
maybe make a medical kit that comes with the last class in the series
great job darling! amen.
hit the thumbs-up    share far and wide!!!
our county department of social services experienced a data breach sometime  ...between 18nov21 and 09apr22 . this included   ...name  date of birth  mailing address  social security number  driver s license number  and information related to services received from county of ___dept. of social services . i received a letter notifying me on 27nov22...gee  thx a lot for acting in such a timely manner...
so glad i have found your channel.
better off without him...or her.
my old insurance company had that and i actually liked it.
@sl4983  they contacted you unsolicited   what did they do for you.
oh  in a community like that a medical practitioner may also be the b team dentist and veternarian.
the changes started well before obamacare. i m sure it was before my experience   but i watched things change massively in the 90s when hmos hit the market. also  we have to confront allopathy s rotten root in the european genocide known as the burning times  which predominantly effected healers and midwives.
the eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.    jefferson davies       fortune favors the prepared mind.    louis pasteur       prepare your mind.
wow! what a blessing to start out the week on! amen!
howdy   patriot nurse!  love your channel!
i wish you would revisit diatomaceous earth. an in depth how to use and benefits would be great! thank you.
as someone who has taken an emt class years ago  i would say  yes  to getting a medical kit  but add - no perishable meds. all the other tools yes  all the meds will expire by the time you use it  making part of the kit a waste of   .
thank you!!!!!!!
jonathan cahn  book return of the gods explains so much of what is going on. so worth the read
thanks for the info!  this video seemed to have a lot more ads than usual  but i just skipped them every minute to get back to the interview.
very nice  invaluable information. thank you!
patriot nurse is so beautiful..inside and out! a beautiful woman with a massive heart!  o  xx
i know that the medical data system does not have all my data.  one of the hospitals i went to has already lost my medical data.  i worked for the government and my data was breached.  computers have made it easy for any person s data to be breached.  what used to be private is no longer private.  how do we change that   don t use the system.  i have had my insurance company calling and wanting to ask me medical questions.  i tell them no thank you i will talk to my doctor.
hi! with yt increasing censorship  do you plan on making a backup channel on rumble or another service  we so appreciate you and your channel.
so agree with the changes since obama care !!! terrible terrible
great guests and interview
i had a dream and i was crying out to the lord  i was so devastated that i had wasted my life.  he turned to me and asked   why do you say that    i rattle off six or seven goals that i never achieved.  he turned to me and said   you may not have fulfilled your goals for your life  but you have fulfilled most of my goals for your life.   at once i felt humbled and overjoyed  but also afraid.  i cried out   lord! since i have fulfilled your goals for my life  will get rid of me now    this must have struck a chord because he had been walking away from me  but instead  he turned back towards me and the look on his face was sadness and compassion.  he touched my cheek and said   you are not disposable.   he paused a moment to think   besides you still have a few things left to do for me.   he smiled at me with loving eyes and said   make a garden grow.  feed my people.   i woke up in tears.
wow 2 of my favorite s together
christa s mic seems to need just a tiny bit more gain    to even out the sound.  when i turn the volume to a comfortable level  i almost lose her  not quite.  if i turn it up for her  the other two feeds are uncomfortably louder.
i concur about the antibiotics  most ppl wont know an emergency situation when to use them ! if ppl dont understand diet is the first and formost treatment for good health they will never know! turn the food pyramid upside down you will have bettered your heathy and learn how to fast fasting is the best medicine to heal the body and mind!!
she is on patreon as well.
wow!
two of my favorite channels!! can t wait!!
i am an advanced senior aviation medical examiner  think  very special agent  ncis . residency trained family practice - i do not do clinical medicine now. i wish to move out of shelby county tn due to the chronic heavy blue style -onerous  regs and  shut them down  approaches. in e tn there is a fella named randy jones who is building communities of tiny home dwellers. looking for like minded folk. my 3 year plan goal is to be in fayette county - the air is clean and the citizenry are adult in manners and behaviour. i wish to open a learning experimental ranch and community of folk who have skill sets that add to the value. medicine and growing  wow those two can go together!  meeting the amish friends near whiteville tn.
stand with pn  !!!
or downplaying time tested interventions in favor of more invasive and less effective interventions  regardless of diagnoses. claiming that effective interventions are miraculously less effective in order to follow certain agendas.
your health data is not safe  i believe it is sold  in spite of hippa. we ve had phone calls from companies wanting to sell my disabled veteran husband with degenerative disc disease medical items for his very specific health issues  and i mean all of them combined were mentioned  no way they could have just guessed at those. we don t use cell phones and he only speaks to his healthcare providers and pharmacy. he s asked these people where they got the information and they refused to answer until one finally told him that he got it from medicare. they do sell our information. i haven t had that happen because i literally have only one condition  hypothyroidism  and they can t sell me anything. seems to me that hippa is a joke. the unaffordable care act really ruined medicine  imo. i m 66 years old and on tricare for life  and medicare. most doctors now only seem to push the things that fatten their wallets-i ve had to fire one because he only pushed vaccines relentlessly and called me pig-headed when i said i would research a particular one and get back to him  i never would have had it because i do not get any vaccines . he fired my husband as a patient because my husband would not buy into the sleep apnea  alien on your face  scam he was pushing that got him more kickbacks. my husband s snoring issue was cured by sleeping with a window open for fresh cool air. you have to be  your own advocate  period. this is why i really respect patriotnurse and have watched her for years.
wonderful!
excellent clip !!!
trust the government yupper i ll get right on it.
as for antibiotics it may not be tgat you are using them too much. it may come from antibiotics given to the animals you later eat as meat.
great video!
to put things in perspective i ve been in this apartment for 12 years now.
you look good pn  thanks for sharing the broadcast.  oh  and   the earth is slow  but the oxen is strong ...

hello cutie i hope all is well with you sis  god bless you
train us to think.  i am a home veterinarian who works on my animals.  i have used super glue on an ear tear  stitched up and splinted broken bones.  delivered kids  lambs and calves.  medical knowledge of any type comes in handy.  also as a pharmacist  it is appalling how many drugs folks are on.  i don t take anything.  folks run to the doctor for everything and any sniffle.     folks with free care are on the most meds and are the sickest.  the best drugs are no drugs and even in my animals are only wormed when they need it and i give no vaccines
infotainment at it s best.....
wow  just noticed  big family homestead  is yet another channel i  seem  to have been unsubbed  no choice of mine. guess my subbie name and types of channels subbed  i am on the big tecch gov watch and kick list.

healthcare in the usa is criminal.  higher cost  lower service.
what about protection of hippa.  a co worker was caught and admitted to viewing someone s medical data was immediately fired.
you are a chosen one. however you want to interpret that. the information you pass to everyone is not only informative  but  is comfort to people who are desperate to find help in a world  that is lacking trustworthy education. you also need to include in your title  multitasking  multiple subject educator not only do you educate on how to medically care for ourselves  but your information on our government  our rights  preparedness  food   nutrition. you are a wealth of information and a blessing to those that find you.i do believe  you are correct  god will say  good job darling  thank you  for all that you do and share

... ...the lord answered and said   o peter  it was necessary that you understand the parable that i told you! do you not understand that my name  which you teach  surpasses all riches  and the wisdom of god surpasses gold  and silver and precious stone s   he gave them the pouch of medicine and said   heal all the sick of the city who believe in my name.  peter was afraid to reply to him for the second time. he signaled to the one who was beside him  who was john   you talk this time.  john answered and said   lord  before you we are afraid to say many words. but it is you who asks us to practice this skill. we have not been taught to be physicians. how then will we know how to heal bodies as you have told us  he answered them   rightly have you spoken  john  for i know that the physicians of this world heal what belongs to the world. the physicians of souls  however  heal the heart. heal the bodies first  therefore  so that through the real powers of healing for their bodies  without medicine of the world  they may believe in you  that you have power to heal the illnesses of the heart also. ...
