stay strong melonie   this country is crying out for godly women.  we need a generation of womenon fire god and his ways.   men as well of course  but the war on women from a-z from the leftis killing our families and way of life stay the course  stay on the straight and narrow.   thank you all you do.

i admit that for far too long  i did not read my bible regularly. it was the end of 2019 i believe  that i finally started reading a chapter a day. i started with jumping around to various books  but the following year  i went back to the beginning and read from genesis onward. i m currently in mark  and my understanding of the bible  while nowhere near perfect  is exponentially better than it was.i am not a perfect christian  but reading the bible is most assuredly the best way to grow a relationship with god. you won t be sorry.

@melonie mac go boomÂ and just know  i appreciate how you stand on the front lines and preach the bible-- not  progressive  ideologies. so many churches are neglecting the meat of the word  and boy am i glad god has raised up someone as sharp and funny as you to do what s right. i m glad to stand by and support you  melonie

if the movie has melonie s dub then i m all in but other than that i don t want the movie  lol i have not seen one thing that interests me since i ve started my walk with christ. i just stick to my old shows and cartoons lol. your videos are the best melonie love them god bless!!

i know you get a lot of hate for expressing your faith  but i m praying for ya to be able to keep it up. have a wonderful day  melonie.

faith in the face of adversity shows strength. keep up the strong morals and ethics.

i very much enjoy and appreciate you and the content you make. taking up courage  confessing the faith  and being a light in a ever darkening world is a risky endeavor indeed. christ s blessings to you  and keep up the faith and the good work.

god bless you mel. you spreading the word of god makes him smile and you ll be rewarded for that in the kingdom of heaven. i hope to be as brave as you someday.

keep speaking the melonie. always be in prayer for those that are lost. hopefully the people that stopped being your friends because of your faith will come to know christ. the lord is still in the saving business
