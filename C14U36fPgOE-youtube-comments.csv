i love it when the same people who complain when the characters are not true to the original because of their skin color  but then hate that they are true to the original story when it comes to lgbt characters
as a child i resonated with anthropomorphic turtles that ate pizza. i did not see myself as a teenager  a ninja  or a turtle  when i was 10 years old  but i was still able to share in their experiences in a meaningful way. there was an element of pretend in there but there was also a huge amount recognition in the basic human experience  even in a children s cartoon. its the later that children pick up on  not the useless trappings.
bro  this is in the game- it s been canon for years.
uh .. ellie is a lesbian. she s a lesbian in the game  both of them. these events happened in a dlc of the first game. lol .. idk man  i m sick of ideologies being shoved down our throats as much as the next guy  but if you came into this series not knowing this was going to be a thing  that s on you.
am i the only person who busted out laughing after she admits she didn t watch past the first episode yet she s complaining about the 7th episode !
everyone in these comments just prove they never played the game or pay attention to it  they re just looking for something to be mad at lmaoo it s embarrassing
imagine not knowing the source material
i love how they never take their own advice in this regard
people when the show is  woke  but they re actually just being faithful to the source material
it s crazy that it s getting backlash considering the characters are actually gay in the game  i m guessing those people haven t played the game which is ok but i m sure they are aware of the games existing at least so it didn t accure to them that maybe the characters are actually gay  .i totally agree with the actress storm reid  if they feel that way then don t watch it.
no  the left behind episode is not filler. is part of the story of ellie first crush and how she got bitten. it was a dlc explaining a bit of ellie s past and why she is how she is when she meets joel. why are we are we complaining of a lore thing   and the episode is 90  exactly how it was in the game dlc lol.at this point im convinced this is just for attention. and the kiss is actually faster in the show than in the game
imagine doing a 27 minute review on an episode she didnt see....
oh my god!! are you telling me... that the lead character of the games whos a lesbian is also a lesbian in the show   real shocker. homophobes are truly something else
but what if the filler episode is goos  what if the episode is character development  what if more people watch tv  shows more so than video games  even if it was filler  i enjoyed it. and i cried a lot. happy to see more and more gay related stuff that isn t hyper sexual.
the review bombs are probably from people who have never played the left behind dlc
i mean  the last of us has an entire dlc devoted to episode 7. this episode explains the origin of ellie s bite  and it develops her experience of loss and her fear of being alone  which are both critically important regarding her relationship with joel. it s definitely not a filler episode.as for bill and frank  they were gay in the game  so it isn t some kind of woke insert. however  episode 3 is a filler episode in the sense that it doesn t drive the main plot and isn t part of the source material. yet  it s really strong thematically as it showcases the complexities of the relationships that take place during the apocalypse. it strengthens themes relevant to the driving relationship in the main plot.so  it is quite relevant beyond them being gay. the sexual orientation is irrelevant in the bigger picture. they are well written chatacters with meaningful narratives  and they happen to be gay. it probably doesn t  pace well in a show with only 9 episodes  but i didn t mind  personally. the biggest criticism i have is that there should be more episodes and less cut content. they cut out some subtle but key moments.
i never had a playstation  so i was incredibly jealous when the last of us came out. i was sick for a few days and decided to watch a playthrough. holy crap does the last of us play out like a high action and intense movie. i highly recommend doing this if you never played the game and are interested in watching the  series .edit  yes  i cried.
bill s story was filler  ellie s story was not. i was wondering if and how they were going to tie the left behind content into the main story for the show since episode 1. they managed to do it masterfully by cutting between past and present to show how this moment in the past affected her decision to stay in the present. it was no more  filler  than any other flashback that advances the plot in some way is filler. people comparing a flashback episode that both fleshes out one of the main characters and shapes their decision in the present to spending an episode on a self-contained story about two characters we will never see again is nuts.
that argument has worked out the past 80 000 times.
more than physical traits or opinions or ways of life  humans in general respond more to themes and struggles that we as humans deal with. that s why good storytelling attracts more people.
shhh you re actually using logic they don t like that remember
i left this reply in another comment  but i feel it s relevant to yours too same. the character i loved the most in the justice league animated series  one of my favorite childhood shows  was the martian manhunter. now  in no way does a shape-shifting  male  martian who lost his wife and children and is essentially a refugee on earth relatable to a 10 year old american white girl  but he had some of the coolest powers and was one of the most interesting characters to me. when i rewatched teh show in college  i found myself still able to relate to him - feeling alone  isolated  where do i belong - because that is a real human experience that most humans feel. this character didn t have to look like me for me to feel represented. it just needed to be a good character and i  the viewer  will derive whatever meaning from it i see.
i ve related to many characters who do not physically resemble me  from ninja turtles and he man to blade. if someone has to look like you for you to relate to it you lack empathy.
excalty  unfortunately the people these days need to see themselves in fiction characters
the 90s tmnt live action movie is better than the 2014 one in my opinion.
but gay people exist they deserve the right to have themselves featured in media like everyone else.
now that i think of it.i never viewed the turtles as teens.they are but to me they always seemed and looked like adult representations of anthropomorphic turtles
@szechuon mm is perfect for autists like me then.yet i unfortunately forget he exists in dc always thought they treated him like the watch towers caretaker than a hero.
@szechuon  remember when he celebrate christmas with the kent s
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  and gay people are being extreme over represented. and it s usually don t in a way that s propaganda and preachy.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  so bottom line  you re comment is irrelevant because nobody so complaining gay people exists or they appear as characters in media. if you think that  you don t understand they people you re disagreeing with. but i know you re a good person and not trying to be a jerk btw. i m not either.
it s been said over and over again.  one of the beautiful things about good storytelling is that we learn of other places and ideas because they are presented in a way we can understand.  we learn that there are other people who may not seem like us  but are going through the same struggles and feelings we are. so we learn we are not alone. and if someone so different can feel the same say and overcome what i m going through  then so can i! but these  activists  haven t had those struggles. they rarely overcome. they ve screamed and demanded  and had their way.  i have a reply to her and to so many  activists.  go read  some call it courage.  yes  double-meaning there.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  oh  we know they exist. they tell us all the time. imagine having all your tv and movies reminding you about a group that has nothing to do with why you re watching them. very annoying.
i related to characters that look nothing like me. from alien robots to borderline immortal canadians  card slinging cajuns and a mute ninja. sure  i also related characters like spawn and blade but it was never because their skin colour matches mine. most times i don t even notice the skin colour unless someone brings it up. the narcissism is at an all time high these days.
i still resonate with those turtles. fiction is there so we can see the best in ourselves not be lectured on the worst of humanity.
nice. is there problem with this show s characters  they don t have basic human experience  they written badly  are they trying to turn you into gay people  are they complaining how bad it is to be a gay because people are mean to them  what is the problem here  can somebody explain  this girl in the video didn t even watch the show  d
@miramax cinemax  she s reading off a website that uses faceless youtubers as references and is written by religious fundamentalists. these are not reviewers  they re activists.
this is a hell of a strawman.
that s what i m saying. i used to feel the same way about blade and i was a white kid. i didn t think i couldn t resonate with him because he was black. i didn t even look at him in that way as a kid. i looked at him as this bad a   vampire hunter in a dope trenchcoat. i didn t think i couldn t  identify  with him because he didn t  look  like me. i always hated that hole  it s cool to have someone that looks like me be represented in this superhero movie  like what  how racist can you get  because that s all it s doing and teaching kids. it doesn t do anything but see everything through a lens of skin color and race. i also felt the same about ninja turtles as well. i thought they was cool teen brothers that eat pizza. my brother and i used to go as them for halloween and sht.
@blue grim  it matters a great a deal  it s about normalizing a group so prejudice is unlikely. if a crime is committed by a certain person from a group  if you don t know that group than it s easy to condemn the whole group and be prejudiced  make your pick  history has abundant examples.   if you had people from that group as friends  neighbors and classmates  then you instantly reject that generalization cause it would include them  and you know them. you realize half the country thought black people are subhuman and that fueled jim crow laws and their defense  you realize we did the same thing you re attacking here to normalize black people by incorporating them in media and entertainment at a time when networks risked losing half the audience as viewers. it worked  just like doing it with gays is partly responsible for why support for gay rights skyrocketed in the last 2 decades. seeing them normalized  is big. american culture is now doing it to the entire planet with streaming. huge contribution by the us to humanity  incredible. it  s working.
@aisha alamoudi  wtf are you talking about  normalizing a group of prejudice  what  yeah your wording is a little bit off so whatever you re talking about isn t really making sense.
@blue grim  knowing people of a certain group normalizes them mitigating prejudice. if you have asian friends  you re less likely to hate on them when someone drums up hate against asians. after 9 11  americans who had muslim colleagues or friends did not adopt the prejudice that  all muslims are terrorists  because they know muslims that wouldn t do that  instantly rejecting that generalization.    we did this with civil rights  black characters in movies and media normalized them to those raised with racism in the south. we did it with gay people  will and grace  modern family  normalizing gays to viewers. it worked. right now  it continues to work globally with streaming  even in theocratic countries  the issue is now discussed and the conversation is forced  for the first time ever gays now have a face and are humanized plus these people in these countries are hearing for the first time that their long held beliefs are actually controversial. that s how progress starts. i take pride in that.
exactly this. having characters be gay or straight is just the trappings  we can still understand the basic humanity. if a beloved character s race is changed  it s just trappings and doesn t impact the basic humanity represented by the character.
@challah bread  ... you only prove hollywood needs to do it even more until it s no longer an issue. we never complain about black people dominating music and entertainment any more  but many conservatives were keenly aware of it and made similar complaints  if i didn t know  i d think black people made up 60  of the country when it s only 10     blacks on the news  blacks in music  blacks in every show  blacks in every film  they re even making an all-black sitcom  this is too much ....
it s a show. it s a movie. its acting. its not real. its entertainment. its  fantasy . telling story   many young people would watch   putting speech in animals that are cute or funny and kids will watch. its then what message is going to be pushed. that is the issue. what agenda
@redtesta  every work is  pushing  a certain morality  there s no way around it  you re showing human characters interacting  certain behaviors will be portrayed as good and others as bad. the question is do you agree with them or not. if you do  you don t complain  if you don t  then brace yourself for talks of  agendas .   how many shows and films present men of religion as good and moral  that is technically you pushing that religion down people s throats. we showed interracial couples knowing of the backlash  complaints about agendas were incessant  they got over it and now 95  support interracial marriages  it was 49  in the 1980 s. showing gay people as normal human beings works to normalize them  it already worked a great deal. i m all in on that agenda. the fact that every time it happens there s a meltdown somewhere  is all the proof i need that they need to do it more.
no your not the only one i did too and it tells you all you need to know just making a video for the sake of complaining about thingss that are pointless because its an addaption of a game series that is just doing what the game series did and the actress simply said dont like it dont watch it because you know isnt that a no brainer here if you dont like something because of something they do then dont watch it which she literally states she hasnt since episode 1 so what she worried about she dont watch it but gotta complain about something.
@bruce wayne  that makes sense after seeing some of her other videos but the fact that this was the first video recomended to me when i look up the last of us show on youtube is kind of annoying.
what do you expect from blind incels
fake gamer-girl  melblwbrhdh mac n cheese made it reality so we don t have to bother with that imagination thing.
they don t have self awareness
@booming bob  understatement of the century
@crimson  it rlly is they talk about thing but never do it themselves they should ve ulf follow   practice wot you preach   but they hate anything associated with gtg even word preach so
it reminds me of the controversy with the channel great american family. people were screaming that it was bigoted because it wouldn t have gay storylines while hallmark said they were embracing  love is love  and diversity. so we are supposed to have to watch their network and suck it up but there can t be another option  heck  logo is a channel specifically designed for the lgbtq population. 7  of the population and we have to pander  i m tired of it.
@jennifer rinaldi  i honestly dont  care about things like the candace cameron movies.  if people want to watch that boring dogshit go for it lol.
they have such an agenda. first velma now this. but the game was very much filled with gay characters. but they have left out some of the better action scenes in the game.
@jennifer rinaldi  there are sooo many good christian shows and programming out there. you can find them if you look hard enough. representation matters! this country was built on representation matters..... bostonteaanyone  notaxationwithoutrepresentation
@lj p  stop parroting back your buzzword propaganda
really eludicate please.
no it is the fact that u yourself don t follow the message. yall does tell ppl this same thing but u don t practice it
@kuggacourage gx  you npcs just parrot the same thing over and over and never take any blame for anything.
@crimson  stop projecting cause that is what ppl like u and the other side are doing. u are literally being an npc right now
@crimson  calling someone a npc is pretty funny coming from you people lol.
@kuggacourage gx  cope and seethe harder  npcs.
@crimson  you guys parrot the same shit with calling everything  woke  to things you don t like. npc energy
@kgeclispe-252  i love it when the woke hivemind all comes in at once. slow night on twitter  huh  npcs  cry harder.
@crimson  calling someone npcs unironically. lmao get off the internet awhile. might be good for you.
i wasn t interested in the show to begin with but when actor s start off with attitudes it s really telling you what to expect. i wonder if they will be showing this in china  russia  or the middle east.......
@crimson   cope and seethe harder npcs ironic people use the exact same line of dialogue in real life to insult people they refer to as npcs lol.both groups are a joke.although i don t disagree this show was likely to be in the pits anyways.
@ace max  what does it matter if it doesn t show in countries that are quite awful to gay people
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  you re also on every comment here nearly even calling people homophobes for basic assumptions.man i should ve stayed with the fallout arguments about nv and 4 people were having.
@booming bob  that was straight-up unreadable.
@chad ballard  i meant to say they scream things but the things they scream and champion they dint do themselves
@booming bob  thanks for clarifying  but i really dont care. just saying  you should probably go back and edit your original comment. looks like you had a stroke while typing it. lol
@chad ballard  anytime i think i didn t realize i messed the wording halfway through the sentence
over what  you re aware the show is a hit right  or are they faking the numbers  top 4 shows on hbo  dragon  tlou  white lotus and euphoria  all labelled woke and all hits  how do  you explain that away.
@booming bob  hbo is the wokest and is carrying warner brothers right now. you need to leave this silo of cope.
she just read an article from that site saying gays are  disordered lifestyles and acts of grave depravity   and in the next sentence she denies there s any homophobia. you just read it.
@djones1234567654321  nice projection  as usual. reee harder  come on
@booming bob  this youtuber was reading from a website where the first line said gays are  disordered lifestyles and acts of grave depravity   and then she goes and uses air-quotes when she says  homophobia  lol. is it intellect or just really reprehensible morality  i know this  it s both.   you guys realize tlou is a hit  22 mil ep. you realize episode 3 led to a 17  bump in viewership. how do you spin this to make it sound like it s some woke flop  or something to gloat about  please tell me there s some new narratives  not just  hbo is faking the numbers ....
@aisha alamoudi  ah there we go the buzzwords hbo a third party company are you trying to take the piss it s probably easy because that s all anyone does is use every buzzword possible
@chad ballard  whoever was saying was using the typical words you hear   bigot   etc  and far as third party i mean companies not the companies releasing the shows and showing their numbers some companies show the views without any intent on hiding sometimes my keyboard doesn t register because my fingers are too fast for it to register sometimes
@booming bob  well maybe you aught to... s  l    o    w        d     o       w          n p
@chad ballard  i type rlly fast so my keyboard can t register it tends to happens also i have lots of keyboards so that could be a factor
@booming bob  right... that s why i said slow down. lol
@chad ballard  yeah i ll try lol
@aisha alamoudi   ideologues don t see themselves as homophobic because they don t understand that thier beliefs are built upon fear. that would require questioning what they believe  and they ve been explicitly conditioned to never do that. that s what indoctrination is all about.it s what gives them such immovable certainty that they re right. thier beliefs are the literal word of god  in thier minds. the absolute and only truth. so  not only do they think they re right  but they think they re righteous. everything is good versus evil to them  and they feel they re fighting alongside god himself.ideological possesion is a dangerous thing. it can lead to many kinds of very powerful  deeply seeded delusions. rarely something that can be reconciled or reasoned with  and in fact  trying to do so often just makes things worse... which is a real pickle. but maybe the worst part is this all the awful things they may think  say and do - it all comes from a place of good intention. however misguided and backwards those intentions may be  they truly believe they re helping  on some level.so  yeah... a real pickle indeed. no idea what to do about any of it. other than wax intellectual in youtube comments  apparently. on that note  let me make this ridiculous wall of text even longer by pretentiously ending on a quote  p of all tyrannies  a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. it would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. the robber baron s cruelty may sometimes sleep  his cupidity may at some point be satiated  but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end  for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. they may be more likely to go to heaven  yet at the same time likelier to make a hell of earth. this very kindness stings with intolerable insult. to be  cured  against one s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason - or those who never will  to be classed with infants  imbeciles  and domestic animals.  - c.s. lewis
@chad ballard  i agree but the role ideologies play is overplayed for regular people. for them  ease  convenience  and not  being assholes  weigh in much more. jim crow was sold to many people in the south as a religious tenet  but  normalizing black people to them in media did work to erode that and they don t see that as very much uprooting their religious beliefs. same thing with gay people in the last two decades  60  of conservatives now accept gay marriage  because gays were normalized to them. don t get me wrong  too many  religious  tenets being eroded like that  many people will question the whole religion  if you re wrong about something so obvious to me  why aren t you wrong about all of it  . after all  the rise of acceptance of gays coincided with a drop in religion and religiosity  pew today report 30  of americans rejecting religions  that s only going up. looking at it from this other end  your points about ideologies ring much more true  these shifting stances did corrode the entire ideology.
@chad ballard  agreed. such wisdom in this comment section. didn t expect it  thanks.
oh  i do. i don t support christians and the last time i watched a christian movie was back when hacksaw ridge came out and i was forced to watch it for my junior history class.
@aisha alamoudi  thank you as well! the world badly need more civil and thoughtful discourse right now. especially in spaces like this.
@booming bob  i don t understand what you wrote. all top shows on hbo  and many top shows on every streaming platform were labelled woke  if i were to conclude a mantra from that  then  woke is cash  is better supported than  woke is broke .
@aisha alamoudi  everything makes money not everything that makes money makes good amount or is even and and broke doesn t even have to mean money
@ethan dollarhide  i was being sarcastic having a hyperbolic reaction to the mere mention of it  like what some people do with  gays .
@booming bob    like avatar 2  it s a huge success  but if you hate disney and wanna push that silly narrative you will say  well  it made 500 mil less than avatar 1  so it s technically a flop   you guys are weird. disney is just a company  judge it like any other company. if you do  it becomes saliently silly.
@aisha alamoudi  we never said it was a flop it may have not been as good as the original because they originally was so different and avatar 2 in the middle of where streamingand nei one goes to theaters anymore but avatar 2 being one of the highest selling is not a flop
@booming bob  i know. what i m saying is it seems like the metric for success or flops shift to fit some narrative.
@aisha alamoudi  it depends how much it was expected to make and how much it cost to make
@booming bob  once again  if you make the claim  you have to prove it  i don t have to prove anything. i ve a long list of shows and films that were labelled woke that were successes. i ve a long list of shows and films that aren t woke that were flops.
@aisha alamoudi  i mean not everything is successful just depends the care but current time most of them habe made less money than they were supposed to the point they actually lost money
@booming bob  literally all studios go through lull periods. disney went through them in the past  paramount just got out of one  warner brothers will probably get out of its lull period this year. disney had been soaring for 7 years  but trending down last year  although they still won the box office  cause it s too big. if pixar flops  marvel scores  if marvel flops  avatar soars....this coming year might be disney s worst if you look at their slate  guardians and little mermaid are where all the hope lies  only 2 films.
@aisha alamoudi  i mean woke is only half it can be woke but if it s actually a good movie then good also if its not woke but bad it all depends if the movie storytelling is good if its woke bit good you kinda overlook unless its insane kind but it all depends as for ant jan its probably we are all done with marvel than anything but it was never supposed to do big
@aisha alamoudi  i mean i think disney biggest lows are with marvel and star wars ngl little mermaid could be good but so did mulan and guardian with james gunn gives hope but the poster looks bad
@booming bob    i hope we ll finally pass beyond this super-hero craze  but it doesn t seem likely. last year s dr. strange2 and thor4 were both not well-received but they still made 1 bil and 760 mil respectively  which was disheartening . if the movie is great but  flops  that s when we suspect genre-fatigue. antman3 was horribly received by audiences and critics  so flopping shouldn t be a sign of fatigue. with dr.strange2 and thor4  the stars can carry the film even if it sucks  antman3 doesn t have that  so if it sucks  it should flop.
@aisha alamoudi  i would say it s more superhero fatigue and the story is bad we had 10 years of it i think it s time to take a break or at least think wot went wrong the only good think they made was nwh but that was mostly sony anyways maybe make something entertaining instead of basic
@booming bob  the marvel genre isn t my thing  you and i dislike it  but you can t deny marvel s success under disney both financially and in audience and critic reception. from almost bankrupt to 31 films almost averaging 1 bil film. star wars  i completely disagree with you. disney s sw is the best era. it recruited me as a fan. then i watched the originals and prequels  all bad films except empire. with disney we got 5 films  4 of which were great and on disney  mando boba fett is fun and campy  kenobi is weak. however  andor is a drama series that rivals the best dramas out there  not just sw  this is unheard of in this franchise. a star wars series is topping critics   publications  and people s lists of top shows.  incredible.
@aisha alamoudi  marvel has been kinda squeezes dry se with star wars star wars trilogy was awful and hasn t made a movie since and their mando season 3 is less than obi wan and boba fetts honestly their animation stuff is better than their live action
@booming bob  spiderman started making billions after disney got involved  it s the mcu machine. if an excellent film flops  then i should suspect fatigue. thor4 and drstrange2 weren t well received  but made money. wakanda forever was well-received so it domestically out-grossed them both  it did so without chadwick. morbius  black adam  antman3 and now it looks like shazam2  were badly received  so flopping is on merit. all this data unfortunately points to a strong recovering market for such films. i m excited for dune and oppenheimer...and little mermaid  that s it.
@booming bob  all marvel s big name are gone  but you ve to remember these weren t big names before the mcu  they made them unlike dc whose character are already iconic. so they did it once  can they a second time  the sequel trilogy was great except for rise of skywalker. both spin-offs were great as well  you may not like them  but they were hits both commercially and critically except for rise of skywalker critically and solo commercially. mando 3 so far is my favorite  ep 2 and 3 are the best in the show ever. they re doing what andor is doing which lagged in viewership as well. plus  they clocked impressive numbers still  1.5 mil. i hope they keep doing that  not fan service.
@aisha alamoudi  honestly mcu apart from spider-man boosted everything honestly think tros is my favorite because it was unique but everything but rogue one was awfully i think people are apathetic
@booming bob  i m one of those whose introduction to star wars was with disney. i watched the original trilogy and prequels divorced from all nostalgia  those films were not good except for empire strikes back. the filmmaking of the disney era is superior  writing  characters  dialogue  actin. take a star wars virgin and have them judge it without prior instruction  it  salient.
exactly this is just pointless they are gay in the first games dlc which this is addapting and ellies been gay since the first game its something you get from it even if you dont play the left behind dlc which every should any way its crucual to the story of the 1st game because it shows you what ellie was talking about when joel asks her about her life before meeting him and it shows how she was bit and ellies girl friends death is crucial to who ellie is as a character and shows how she got bit and what she had to go through before meeting joel and who cares if they are gay its characters who happen to be lesbians. gays exist in the real world they are gonna be in fiction too who cares get over it or as the actress said have a problem with it dont like it dont watch the show that simple you dont have to watch it and the show continues without your viewing of it its that simple. and wait until they start addapting last of us part 2 and introduce dina  how are people gonna react then which is a no brainer that they will with this being the most successful game addaption ever and breaking the curse for once and it being extremely popular atm. they wont even have to wait years or recast to addapt last of us 2 because ellies actress bella ramsey is already 19 or 20. the last of us 2 is really good and a got a good story be silly not to addapt if the first season of the last of us has been this successfull and this well receieved.
it was dlc  boring dlc at that.
nope it was absolutely filler lolthe game didn t need it in the original cut of the story  and neither does the show. knowing about the finer details of how ellie got bit and how she lost her girlfriend is irrelevant to the plot. it certainly didn t need an entire episode dedicated to it. it could ve been shown in a short flashback.
@lakerfan024  irrelevant for the plot  lmao glad you only write youtube comments.
@these knots  take away episode 7. pretend it never existed. now tell me how the plot changes as a result of episode 7 not being there. i ll wait.
@osleya the champion   the plot doesn t change but   there you go. thanks for admitting it. since the plot wouldn t change  it is by definition  filler . congrats  you played yourself. funny you called me  brainless  yet you re the one who just admitted the plot doesn t change and therefore the episode is filler
they re saying they don t need an entire episode dedicated to it.
@mj p  they dont need an entire episode dedicated to fleshing out a main characters backstory
@nam  being gay isn t a backstory. have they done one on how joel was straight  get real. it s all agenda. we get it  hollywood loves gay people.
@mj p dude  you are literally just mad that it s gay characters.
@mj p   stories have heterosexual romances that are driving plot points and character refinements literally constantly. you had no issues with joel and tess having a close relationship. personally not gay and not that invested in this argument  but would like to point out the blatant hypocrisy and tunnel vision here and yes  what seems to be homophobia..
@mj p dude there s literally a whole dlc about it  that s what the episode was about
fr
@mj p  the episode wasn t just about ellie being gay it shows the first time shes ever killed someone it was a back story
the last bit is so real  ellie totally reminded me of myself when i was younger. we needed to see like  the first real  gay crush  represented instead of everything being serious.
@squirrelbeez  this was literally like me and my bf before i started transitioning. just like being the best of friends  shit talking each other  and then the first kiss. ugh.
ong yes  exactly this!! being all giddy to just be near someone
that s what i m saying likeee
i agree with the ellie back story part but the hole bill and frank back story was so pointless. all that sht did was make bill the most pointless character ever and yes i know he is gay in the game but in the game he was actually a very important part of that second of the story. it was a really good part of the story too but in the show they just made it all out to be some pointless love story that went literally nowhere at all.
@blue grim  the end result in the game is the same end result in the show -- the purpose of bill s story is to further ellie and joel s  ie.  get the car . it wasn t a pointless love story  it was another catalyst for joel to show he has to protect who he loves. that s what bill did -- protected who he loved. did they need an entire episode dedicated to bill and frank for it  no  but it was beautiful and got the message across. i could look at the video game for bill s other scenes if i so wanted to. the show had the opportunity to give more than the game did  and they pulled it off wonderfully. the entire theme of the last of us is about humanity -- grief  relationships  love.
didn t drive the plot forward  the entire point of bills part of the game was for joel and ellie to get a car  and in the show they still get a car  so factually speaking  the plot moved forward just as much as it did in the game
@zachkerth-cl6yc  the bulk of the episode doesn t drive the main plot at all. joel and ellie spend like a few minutes in the episode reading the letter and getting the stuff. i just argue that the romance side story isn t irrelevant to the main plot. whether it s justified is another argument.
@hayden  the bulk of bills town didn t drive the plot forward in the games either aside from the very end when they got the car
@zachkerth-cl6yc  in the game  it is largely part of the main plot. ellie and joel are the focus as they overcome an obstacle in their way. it is literally the main narrative unfolding. you may take note that we do not control 16 years of bill and frank living their daily lives in the game. that would be a side story. to me  it is a strange artistic choice to have a full side narrative about a minor character in a show with only 9 episodes where significant scenes from the source material are already missing. this is not to say that i think the episode is poorly written or unpowerful  but i understand the criticism  the valid criticism that isn t just anger at a gay love story . that being said  i certainly didn t mind the episode. it was enjoyable for me despite it feeling out of place.
@bluegrim4252  yea this is also a valid criticism. i haven t played the game since 2017 or 2018  so i forget most things about bill in the game. i m having a lot of  oh yea  moments as i see people pointing out scenes that were better in the game  or cut out from the show entirely . i m ultimately not too chuffed about it. the game is the game  and the show is the show for me  but i do wonder if i d enjoy the show less had the first game been fresher in my mind.
yep. watch a no commentary playthrough of the first game and stop there. you won t regret it
the game is 100x better than the show. also  when the game was made  the creator  neil druckman  had people there keeping him in check  as the overall idea was his  he also wanted to do some insanely dumb things  which the director would not allow. ever since the game became so popular   made so much money  sony has since made neil the defacto president of the game studio and allowed neil to help write much of the scenes for the hbo show  which neil has gone on to admit that he would be injecting his woke ideology. so in short  the game  part 1  is not woke  but the hbo show is heavily woke.
the first game was great
well they have the gay romance there also
what do you disagree with if you do not mind me asking
thus the intrigue in ellie s character  i found myself and my friends relating a lot to her in the latest episode. same with joel and his struggles  my dad loves the guy.
i don t think either of the episodes are filler. the bill episode provides a look at life outside of the cities and demonstrates the passage of time in a different context from what we ve already seen via joel or ellie. it was also incredibly heartfelt and excellently acted  and very atypical of the usual stereotypes lgbtq viewers have been used to seeing. the recent episode is ellie s backstory origin and that s necessary to understanding her motivations. none of the material that is being accused of pandering is an example of hamfisted plot appropriation  it s compelling story telling that any empathetic person can appreciate regardless of sexual orientation. so it seems like the complaint is in the cast members characterization of backlash rather than with the material itself. and it s a bit disingenuous to declare the episodes as  gay episodes  because so little of the effectiveness of the story being told revolves around the fact that the characters are gay. it s almost incidental. they are identifiable characters that happen to be gay  so even the 7  accurate representation argument is off base. if we add up the minutes of the entire season and subtract the minutes that were dedicated specifically to so-called  gay issues   whatever that constitutes  would be far below 7  of the overall running time.
its gay so it must be filler! even if it shows more of ellies character and who she is
imagine saying they are filler episodes and admitting you haven t seen the show  weird
because it s canon  episode 7 is canon. what s the problem  the actress is right.
they ll remain to be told if something sucks regardless if people watch it or not. they need to come up with a better comeback than telling us not to watch.
the  gay filler  episode adapted the game dlc perfectly therefore its not filler.you just want a reason to hate
the fact that you can get up and dress yourself shocks me. everyone is now dumber because of watching you re video congrats
bill s felt more like pandering  i didn t watch past the pilot. ridiculous. don t talk about this like you saw it lmao.
you re guilty of critiquing something you haven t watched.backstory isn t filler either  it all matters. it s not what you do  it s how you do it.
this episode isnt filler   this is literally pulled straight from the dlc of the first game.
i never watched a show to be represented. i just want a good show.
i ve been loving the show as a fan of the game.
dang dude this is a self own. it s in the game  and if it wasn t  it s character building for the protagonist. this was objectively a good episode and not filler.
one decides whether they liked a series as a whole after watching  not because a young actress told them to continue watching or not  and definitely not  i watched one episode and decided i don t like the whole series.  and showrunners will show us what they decide to  for the story they want to tell  whether intentionally or not promoting their beliefs to us viewers. if we enjoy watching  it is up to us to interpret it and explain it to ourselves and to those who look to us for explanation as best we can. ultimately i would hope that those who decide to start  continue and or stop watching a show  are doing so for personal reasons.
i never watched it to begin with but by all means give me more reasons to keep that going.
i love gay people!!!
imagine being a gamer and calling this filler when it s literally in the game
this has never ended well  lol. have a great day  melonie. love your hair edit  hey  i see my tweet right there at the beginning
as someone who played the game they aren t filler episodes . that have importance to the story so it s very much not filler
since when was  don t like it  don t watch it  an unreasonable proposal ffs  there are enough people that genuinely like the show that they don t need the hate-watchers to make up numbers. so go elsewhere. it s fine. no reasonable person will miss the  it s too gay  crowd one bit...
what i wanted to say but better
as a gay man i disagree. the way it was done in the game  with the implication of a relationship  was way better. it s obvious how much bill cared for the dead guy in the game  they didn t have to go into showing everything ab their lives. frankly  i just didn t care. the entire time they were on screen  i wanted to go back to the story of joel and ellie. kinda made me feel the same as playing as abby in tlou2. unnecessary sexual additions that only drag down the quality of the piece of media by making it feel trashy. this is supposed to be ab life and death. survival. that s what made the original game work so well. it was sexless and maintained its focus on the emotional story of a man s trauma and redemption.
@johnny r  ep7 was the best one and ep3 was garbage. if it was bill and francesca  people would be calling it out for what a waste it was. it lacked the physicality and rawness of the world  like you said  its about survival. instead they literally live in luxury and even had the medicine. like how has it not expired  who diagnosed frank. sigh. it was just insulting.
@stud snob  that too  thank you. i honestly couldn t even pay attention to most of the episode. it was so dull and boring. i haven t even seen episode 5 yet  bc 4 was so painful.
@johnny r  id give it a chance  im enjoying the series  but all of my friends and collogues started watching and lost interest completely. so much talent went into the series  its sad seeing it not be as much of a hit it should have.
@johnny r  life can be about more than just surviving and in the game it isn t really implied... bill said frank was his partner and you clearly see bill s sexy time magazine. yes episode 3 was different from the game but i think that its fine that is was more  fluffy  in a way. it wasn t too deep into the plot yet and it was a sweet compelling story. with riley and ellie their episode is important context for who ellie is as a person.
@dizzisliving  it was implied. he never outright said he loved him. calling him his partner was a big part of the implication. it leaves it a bit open to the imagination. partner doesn t automatically mean  romance . people hear  partner  in a survival situation and they easily think  okay two people working together to survive . it s just how joel and tess were implied to be in a relationship. that was a straight couple  and it was still not a huge highlight of the story  bc it maintained it s focus. yes  even in life and death situations  life can still be about the little moments. literally the point of the first game  which handled it s themes in a much more mature and classy way than resulting to sex scenes to expand the runtime. i understand why they did it in the series  to give fans of the game some more background into frank and bill s relationship. just because i understand something doesn t mean i agree with it. the implications of romantic relationships between characters made a lot of sense bc people are  usually  too busy to focus on them. that s why it was restricted to subtext  bc it was so much more realistic. romantic relationships would definitely still be a thing  but they d be far from anyone s focus  only popping up in large moments of downtime. it was much more realistic.honestly  another reason i m against it is because it was plainly done for an agenda. if not  then explain to me why they wouldn t expand meaningfully on tess and joel s relationship  when both of their characters are more vital in both the game and the series  why did they only expand the gay relationship when both were merely implied to begin with  and they went the effort to expand on bill s relationship with frank...only for ellie never to even meet bill  we don t even get bill s iconic interactions with ellie  lame.
hahaha exactly. she is trippin  hard.
bias
don t need to see all of that crap show to know that is a crap show.
@anonymous !  yeah...a good tv show...for gays.at least i have a brain  pal.
@daniel jimenez  your favorite show sucks.
@david m  his favourite show is fox news
@daniel jimenez  keep crying them big salty tears man baby.
@anonymous !
@daniel jimenez  then game is also good for gays since the amount of gay people is the same as the game lol.
@daniel jimenez   you re so idiot  isn t a coherent statement lol.
you shall not lie with a male as with a woman  it is an abomination.
@daniel jimenez  that may be true  but you do need to watch it if you re gonna formulate an opinion n present it like it s a credible opinion lmao
@heather van buskirk  what a contribution to society
they are filler episodes  especially episode 7 which is literally a dlc from the game the episode does nothing to further the plot  which is probably why it was originally dlc in the game
@peer165 tell me how it doesn t qualify as filler  i ll wait. it didn t further the plot at all. you could ve skipped that just like the video game did  it was dlc  and still had the story turn out the exact same.
ive watched the entire series so far it was a filler episode that went on way to long
@bladesofgrass  how was it a filler   it was literally part of the story bro
it s as much of a filler as episode 5 lmao
@dustin mills  lol that s exactly what filler is. look it up. filler is when the story or plot is not advanced hardly at all. episode 7 fits that description.
@fortychase    well if you are referring to them meeting up with henry  then that was a pretty good chunk of the actual game and was relevant to the story i m aware that this episode was based on the dlc and i honestly feel like that was irrelevant to the story aswell
@bladesofgrass  well that s you re feeling lmaoo a filler would be a side story that doesn t effect the plot  we see how she gets bit  therefore effecting the plot. you see
@fortychase    valid point that being said it went one for way to long and i just didn t care
@bladesofgrass  agreed
@fortychase    did we just have a conversation like adults   crazy
@bladesofgrass
sooooo weird. then she projects her own attitude on fans by saying  i think people are using this to get famous  people who want attention  - which is basically what she s doing lol. weird af.
@fortychase    i m sorry you support gays
@hplovecraftscat  i said that    hmmm
@daniel jimenez  millions of viewers  globally  contradicts your single opinion. i think i ll agree with the millions.
@heather van buskirk   but little boys are ok to lie with as with a woman.   -catholic priests throughout history
@see cha  one of the most stupid conclusion.so  if the entire world population agrees that donkeys have wings and can fly  donkeys have wings and can fly then.oh  boy  such stupidity.
imagine not being able to think for yourself
she said they appeared to be filler episodes. but keep saying she has no idea what is going on... because the irony is hilarious.
they were filler episodes. now that i ve seen the finale  it s obvious this show didn t have enough time to spend on extraneous side characters.
it is a filler episode though.the story doesn t progress which is quite literally the definition of a filler episode. technically speaking nothing happens.
@hocane  lmao so if that was the pilot episode would it not be filler then   since it would be  progressing  the story  technically    like cmon bro
@fortychase    if those were the pilot episodes no one would watch the show.
@hocane  lmaoo you probably still watched all the way through
@fortychase    yeah i had it on the side monitor  wasn t really invested.
no one cares. two gay romance filler episodes in a nine episode season screams of agenda  and people are tired of woke agenda.
@cristela  lol what does that even mean anymore  xd the things that happen in these two episodes i.e. hanging out together  arguing  choosing to die together etc. are not inherently gay things. substitute a straight couple into both episodes and the storyline literally does not change - nothing about them is inherently gay. when that is the case  it s pretty obvious that there are people that just don t like to watch gay relationships on screen. commentary channels like this used to criticise cringe portrayals of lgbt stuff  and rightfully so  anyone remember the disasterclass that was batwoman    now it s criticising any portrayal  even the mere existence  regardless of whether the storyline itself is actually gay in nature  or not. the portrayals can be exactly how a straight relationship would be shown  yet people would still take issue with it.both episodes are just two people hanging out  and they just happen to be gay - where is the agenda  xd i highly fucking doubt we would be seeing videos like this if riley was just a dude  or if frank was actually a woman called francesca.some people just go full circle - if you can t differentiate between cringe portrayals and perfectly normal portrayals  then i think you just have a problem seeing it in general.
@charliewarlie  they complain about other people being  easily offended  when they are then ones being offended by... 2 people kissing. they just can t stand seeing a gay couple without crying about it. it s truly amazing.
@cristela  so a person being gay is an agenda
@cristela  lol what. bill was gay i. the game and ep 7 wasn t filler it s from the dlc and ellie is gay in game to
@dakoata  dlc equals filler. if it s not in the main game  no one cares.
@cristela  if it s about a main character s backstory then it s canon filler is something that isn t canon
@cristela  literally everyone cared xd ellie is a much loved character for everyone familiar with the games  which is why the dlc was so positively received. it s also why fans of the game were very much looking forward to this left behind episode  and what it would add.
@dakoata  you have no idea what filler is. filler can be canon  doesn t change the fact that it s filler and doesn t progress the story
@decreiver receiver  it adds debt to a character a main character which is canon it progresses the story by showing how ellie feels about joel and plays into her biggest fear of being alone. at the start of the ep she is about to leave joel and try to go back to tommy. she gets the flashback and then the fear of being alone kicks in idk how it flew over ur head
@decreiver receiver  it progresses the story the story tho  ep 3 joel and ellie still get a car even if they took a alternate route they still got the car which was the main focus at the time. ellie s backstory plays into her reasoning for staying with joel
@cristela  yes tell that to the many gamers who buy and love dlcs from actual story based dlcs like left behind to cods bullshit.also by saying this you are calling every dlc bad essentially even new vegas  dlcs which are awesome or dying light s which is better than the main game.
@dakoata  adding debt to a character is not progressing the story. literally the definition of filler
@mister pinkman  i couldn t care less  i m not even watching the show. just saying how it is  pretend there isn t an agenda all you want  can t force people to accept it though.
@raidenfay  what country are you talking about  cause  for your information  i m not american. and the moment you resort to insults you lose the argument.
@cristela  you say you haven t watched the show then you say there is an agenda. those 2 don t add up  sorry
@cristela  gay people exist in real life. it s not an agenda. and like you said  it s only 2 out of 9 episodes that have gay content. there s plenty of other shows to watch if you want to see straight people. also  these characters were gay in the video game this show is based on  so they re just sticking to the source material.
@vertigo dead serious. 6  if your brother  the son of your mother  or your son or your daughter or the wife you embrace or your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly  saying   let us go and serve other gods   which neither you nor your fathers have known 7 some of the gods of the peoples who are around you  whether near you or far off from you  from the one end of the earth to the other  8 you shall not yield to him or listen to him  nor shall your eye pity him  nor shall you spare him  nor shall you conceal him. 9 but you shall kill him.
@heather van buskirk  then that is not objective and your entire rant is meaningless. now go back to the crazy house.
@julian davis  yes
@truth crime  that s dumb and doesn t make sense
@truth crime  if you think this little corner of the internet is 99  of the world then you need to expand your world view my friend
@heather van buskirk  then you are bisexual. if for you being straight is a choice then you have an attraction to both sexes and you think everyone else does. this is why you are so sure it s a choice  cause it s a choice for you   .
@vertigo  it is always a choice. keep coping.
@vertigo  all i see is a psyoped npc.
@vertigo  yeah i m on redpills  they d probably be helpful for you.
@heather van buskirk  redpills make you quote bible verses  lol
@ted ehioghae  when s the deadline   p
@hplovecraftscat  imagine being reported for hate speech  being banned and having to subscribe to every channel again  couldn t be me.
@arcane vi  waaaah
i would love to see the neilson numbers for this show... because i really wonder just how many people are watching this show...
@heather van buskirk  cool story!
@vigilante89  the one and only.
@heather van buskirk  idk  there are plenty of fairy tales like the one you quoted.
@heather van buskirk  you should read the whole bible and take notes of the contradictions you ll ignore.
dlcoh you mean post-filler  you mean like  tacked-on garbage  right
@heather van buskirk  it gives context to ellie mentioning riley throughout the main game. and adds backstory to ellie getting infected. the only reason yall are saying its filler n useless is because ellie is queer.
@jaylen smith lol nope it s filler because if you took episode 7 out of the season  the story and plot would stay the exact same. that s filler. it doesn t further the plot at all. we already knew ellie was bitten and immune. that s the story detail that mattered from episode 7 but we already knew that.
@schneed  looool first off i m 26  not a kid. but thanks for the assumptions. secondly  noooope. you don t need to know how ellie got bit and how she lost riley. that s  uh  kind of why the backstory was originally dlc  because dlc is usually extra stuff that was not necessary to include in the original game     here  try this- pretend episode 7 never happened. now tell me if anything changed in the present day of the story from the time that episode 6 ended and episode 8 began. try to tell me what changed if you didn t have episode 7  hint  absolutely nothing changed .
@lakerfan024  i literally told you how it effects the current story in my first comment. you lack reading comprehension and your age i see. interesting lol.
@schneed  yeah except your first comment wasn t a good argument. again  tell me how the story changes if you take out episode 7. just pretend it didn t exist. now tell me how the story changes without episode 7 i ll wait .
@lakerfan024  it would change ellie significantly. it could also possibly effect her decision to stay with joel as he told her to leave. you literally have no comprehension when it comes to writing. it s kind of hilarious. lol.
i can t remember from the game  did ellie kissed riley in the game. i know she s gay in part 2.
@tcp_toyz  - in the dlc i think
@tcp_toyz  yea in the dlc
that s how 99  of people are. the 1  who actually care are weirdos on twitter. i don t watch stuff just cuz a hispanic is in the lead if it sucks then it sucks
same. the character i loved the most in the justice league animated series  one of my favorite childhood shows  was the martian manhunter. now  in no way does a shape-shifting  male  martian who lost his wife and children and is essentially a refugee on earth relatable to a 10 year old american white girl  but he had some of the coolest powers and was one of the most interesting characters to me. when i rewatched teh show in college  i found myself still able to relate to him - feeling alone  isolated  where do i belong - because that is a real human experience that most humans feel. this character didn t have to look like me for me to feel represented. it just needed to be a good character and i  the viewer  will derive whatever meaning from it i see.
great! but it truly only matters if one feels they aren t being represented enough or at all.  then tunes change and ppl cry. imagine if christians were underrepresented  misrepresented  or not represented at all. most would decry foul! it s already happening.
because people like you are represented as a default
as a black guy  i will say i dont watch something because it has a black lead  but i am heavily fatigued by forced or negative stereotypes. a good non-cis-white-male lead is all cool when the story not only calls for it but actually is a natural part of the story. for example  get out isn t  good  because  omg finally a movie about or prominently featuring blk ppl  it s good because the movie itself is just mostly enjoyable and as a blk person it gets bonus points for imo accurately and positively neutrally portraying one of many types of blk families. i m not part of the lgbt  community but imo bait switching last of us fans to create more lgbt supporters is just wrong. bill and frank could have been given more natural and extensive roles instead of being used to feature softcore pr0n in a series that never had it. this would have been more fitting in a horror movie with a gay lead or side characters.i was looking forward to the next episode because it seemed like a narratively relevant flashback episode but if it s just another way to force audiences to engage in lgbt it says a lot about the creators..
there is nothing wrong with having gay characters in media.
@lakerfan024  that s because the dlc fills in information we didn t get in the original game but that information is directly tied and integral to the original game. it s quite simple really little one. you re so funny. you re getting so upset.
@lakerfan024  the ellie   riley story wasn t included in the original because of time restraints at the time  not because it wasn t important. if it wasn t important  they wouldn t have made it at all. you re so funny trying to seem like you know what you re talking about when you have no idea haha.
@schneed  lol  it wasn t included because of time  not because it wasn t important  yet they somehow managed to still make a phenomenal  coherent story without that dlc content . but sure  it was so integral that they left it out in the original version of the game .listen to yourself  trying to pretend that something so  integral  to the story would just be left out because of  time restraints . you do know what integral means  right little buddy  if something is so integral like you keep claiming  they obviously wouldn t just leave it out because of  time restraints . but they did leave it out of the original game and yet  the story made perfect sense and was excellent without the left behind dlc.  you re so funny trying to seem like you know what you re talking about   i could say the same thing about you acting like you know what the word  integral  means because clearly you don t. you also don t know the difference between  effect  and  affect  either
the whole point of the dlc is to be filler  it s not important to the main story otherwise it would be in the base game and not dlc  like every other game that has dlc it s just a way to get you to play a bit longer. not saying that s a bad thing  i just understand where she s coming from  they really didn t need to dedicate an entire episode on a dlc addon especially considering the fact that they ve already been cutting so much of the video games action moments that make it fun out of the show  just find it really boring when there s nothing but two characters doing nothing but talking and not alot of things actually happening
@britzz  a ton is happening story wise  it s just not a lot of action. because it s boring to watch a ton of that. in the gameplay  it makes sense why there is so much action. it doesn t translate well to shows. i d rather watch 2 character develop than watch joel kill his 100th runner of the episode  feel me
@enishi4ty5  i hear you but i hear the flip side. that community is constantly being misrepresented and mislabled and misunderstood bc christians and non-christians do not agree with their lifestyle. they were constantly forced to watch hetero relationships b c it was mainstream and the norm! they felt the same way about other shows that you feel about ep. 3 of tlou. i see it from all sides  probably bc i too am in another minorty group. everyone is allowed their moment of yes and equal moments of cringe!! thats the great cycle of life.
@realpersonhere  you mean under represented based on population. but just assuming you re correct about that is absolutely ridiculous. no evidence. unfounded and quit nasty of you.
@realpersonhere   so all the people who said they are black and brown and don t care what the skin color of the characters are you re just informing  like  on this exact comment  how do you rationalize your ridiculous view point when it s debunked in front of you. you just assume whites agree with the main comment and black and brown people don t.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  can you stop reposting the same comment that nobody is even arguing about. stop strawmaning lol
@enishi4ty5  by negative stereotypes you mean a statistical reality  so you want propaganda  most black homes are single mother homes. periods. most criminals are blake people. period. but get out is like my top five favorite films of all time. so you got good taste. but what you want is propaganda.
@paulo cezar  what
@lj p  also  how are christian misunderstanding and mislabeling the lgbtq
@lj p  also  hetero is mainstream and the  norm still. no matter how over represented lgbtq are in media now..
@jesse  the serie
@jesse  shush. dude s just trying to tell everyone how good of a person he is.
@ieatpaste23  his virtue signaling has been maxed out.
@jesse  it has.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  gays don t need to be represented  ellie being a lesbian is so superficial and not even important to her character
@tcp_toyz  ellie was relealed as lesbian  bisexual  i don t remember  in the dlc  so it was confirmed so much before the series and the second game
yess. and tlou is great.
@tankcoatpink  yes she did kiss riley in the games.
it s not about you  it s about normalizing gay people to homophobes. it worked. liberals did it with blacks as well  incorporating black characters when half the country would be outraged by positively portrayed black characters in the 60s and 70s. you guys throw that line at every show and film....it s silly.
@tcp_toyz yes  she does in the dlc - which is what this episode is based off.
@jesse  the thing you hate on these days is actually one of american culture s greatest contributions to humanity in the last 50 years. in the 60 s  those same people did with blacks the same thing they re doing with gays right now  both groups were suppressed in media for fear of alienating the audiences  and both were introduced slowly  carefully and deliberately  this can t happen organically.  the research on this is definitive  passively viewing gay or black characters normalizes them  aka mitigates homophobia and racism. in the us  both were incredibly successful  that s obvious. but worldwide is where i wanna divert your attention. today  these shows are consumed everywhere  i can show you reviewers in islamic theocracies discussing these  gay things . all is vile  but that s how progress starts  forcing the conversation. for the first time ever these people are hearing that their position is actually not  uncontroversial   add to that the passive effect of giving gays a face  they re no longer an  evil abstract notion . i would be incredibly proud if i were one of those people that did that. it s incredible. it s working  globally.. do you really not see the value in that
translation no gay people.
@valorie     so you are saying act like gay people don t exist
you do realize when ppl don t like a series they don t watch the entire series right  imagine taking a bite of food that taste disgusting just continue eating the entire meal to make sure you hated it
@truth  except not every episode  tastes  the same for you to judge the entire show over an episode you didn t even finish
you re not the only one i was turned off by sarah s performance and the lack of emotion in both her and joel during that scene if they can t get sarah right they re never gonna get any other characters right!
it was filler there  too.
the dlc was a walking simulator with terrible cut scenes
that s what i m saying lmaooo a gay filler
i never thought of it as filler  but if the masses of people watching or gamers who played the last of us 1   the dlc think it gave a  filler  feeling  that is a massive red herring  the left behind dlc makes you feel emotionally connected to ellie  riley  their dynamic   chemistry is clear... if most of the episode failed to make audiences deeply emotionally invested in the characters   ellie like the game did then it could feel like a pointless whole episode gone.that would make it 2 entire episodes with no ellie or joel development  every second of screen time should be getting the job of making people love   bond with ellie more so in episode 8 when she is up against you know who people are more immersed into ellie.neither episode was meant to be  filler   i also haven t seen anyone on the internet complain or criticize this episode for anything related to homophobia two girls kissing  all the normie people seem to just feel it was  boring  or  had no action  while people who played left behind feel it had less emotional weight behind it than the game  the character dynamic felt stiff dry this leads to the actual things they say or do with each other feeling awkward like that kiss.all these news articles and celebrities or directors seem to largely be confused  i think we should differentiate people not liking something because of homosexuality being involved and not liking something that includes homosexuality  but that itself isn t the reason of disliking it. there s also the possible the artist  celebrities  directors are focusing on the .001  of audiences that critic it because of the homosexuality to distract away from all the real or valid critics.
@lamont cranston iv  not really it was back story for ellie because she had very little
look as a straight man i m more willing to accept lesbians you can call me what you want don t care.i love women if had to choose i d rather have a lesbian daughter. than the other one.  i hole heatedly hate the other ones
@narcos  it be like that bro
@lamont cranston iv filler in the game  it was a post-launch dlc
@anthony m  so
@son goku  and that s your opinion...
@lamont cranston iv  well  what was it acting as a filler for  it s essential as it gave ellie a history  unless  she was born at the age of 14  with no history before her.
almost the entire show has been filler. it s about 9 hours long. the game is roughly 5. yet they removed many things and what they put has been waterdowned to just walking and taking. it s a mediocre bore.
@son goku  uh the dlc is not much different from how the main game plays just because it has the bonding section with riley doesn t make the entire thing a walking simulator since much of it is intercut with ellie in the present fighting davids men and infected in the mall.
@sonderdaze x  yeah to bad the game actually explained that better though.
it wasn t in the game  it was optional dlc.
right lol i don t call this episode filler i told alot of people this episode is dlc
what s the difference in meaning between  in the game  and  literally in the game   dlc is by definition filler. unnecessary when the game is played.
@stacy hamilton   not necessarily there are games with dlc that is adds to the story which makes it now necessary
imagine not realizing 1. it is dlc which means it technically wasn t in the original cut or story of the game 2. it is filler because if you removed episode 7 completely  the plot and story would stay exactly the same. episode 7 doesn t change anything about the story or plot  so it s filler
@amador cortinas backstory can still be filler . the story of ellie when she was younger doesn t further the plot. we already knew she was bitten and infected but immune. the details of how it happened and a relationship she had could ve been condensed into a short dialogue between joel and ellie. that s also probably why it was dlc  because having it in the original game would not have affected the story at all.
@lakerfan024  it also explained a plot whole of how ellie got joel to the cabin!
@lakerfan024  the dlc is canon so that s completely negligible regardless if it s part of the main story or not and you know it. 2.  because it s showing the story of how ellie got bit and ended up with the fireflies which she only told briefly on how it happens which doesn t hurt the story at all
@sonderdaze x  i mean true. it didn t hurt the story but i guess you can say it didn t help it at all either i gues
@fortychase    didn t she already allude to the fact that she wasn t straight
@stacy hamilton  this is 100  false. unless said dlc is non canon then it s filler
@son goku  get help on your other comments on this channel man lol
@dimension zone  it also doesn t advance the story one bit. we already knew ellie got bit and was immune. we also already knew she ended up with the fireflies. knowing how she got bit or how she ended up with the fireflies changes the events of the main game exactly 0.00000 . the relevant information that 1. ellie was bit but immune and 2. was with the fireflies was already in the main game and in the show. the only thing we didn t know is how ellie got bit and how she ended up with the fireflies  but knowing how that happened doesn t change anything about the main game story. so yeah  episode 7 is filler. take out episode 7 and tell me what about the story about joel and ellie s journey actually changes. does ellie change from episode 6 to episode 8 because of the flashbacks in episode 7  nope. does the story change or move forward advance because of the flashbacks  nope. so it s filler
it was dlc that mostly nobody played.  most ppl think it was part of the full game because they inserted into the game in the remaster.   regardless boring is boring.
@frankenstein md   mostly nobody played  i have to ask how do you know that lol
it is in the game  but it s also filler because it distracts from the main plotline of the game. this episode and the bill episode would have been better placed after the season was over and not interrupting the flow of the main plot.
@dimension zone  what do you think the definition of  filler  is
its the dlc....
tlou was a garbage walking simulator. keep crying
no  it s in the dlc and was totally unnecessary
yeah but instead of shoving it down people s throats why not reference riley in a subtle way and leave the reference with real fans who remember and don t need a whole episode about it we also don t need these barely known side actors to try and get famous from the clout of this game. i could have found a better riley and sarah marlene and tess. terrible.
i think your the smartest person on youtube i thought they didn t exist anymore but thank god there are still smart and sane people out there
well filler means boring pointless crap  so it applies nicely to the garbage games it s based on lmao
@sonderdaze x  so you re a helmet wearer  got it. eat your nuggies kiddo  adults are talking
@fortychase    lmao the whole thing is filler aka pointless boring crap
@gunsalves  i m not surprised honestly. the games are barely anything more than a boring walkathon
@chandller burse  extremely boring and pointless. yeah that s naughty dog and their crappy games in a nutshell
@wayne white  lmfao the hardest is believing you have friends
@tonylavagnaart  the whole thing is a boring waste of time. they should just set the cast on fire  that d be fun and entertaining
@bw estacado  jak and daxter and uncharted and crash were not boring.also they aren t your games thats your opinion i find some enjoyment in the last of us still not as much as their previous ones thats why i don t care for saying tlou1 is a masterpiece.most people here would say they love the the last of us 1 tho as far i see.it doesn t matter its all subjective.crash is still their best
@stacy hamilton  are sequels filler  what are you even saying
@luke scioscio  when a story has had a beginning middle and end any added content is filler. sequels have their own 3 act story to tell. your question is nonsensical.
@stacy hamilton  that s not what the word filler means. try again
@luke scioscio  filler episodes are entries in a generally continuous serial that are unrelated to the main plot  don t significantly alter the relations between the characters  and generally serve only to take up space.
filler is  literally  in the game.
@bw estacado  woke  so  in an apocalyptic world where you have clickers  the idea of homosexuals in said world  is what you have trouble understanding
@lamont cranston iv  it was dlc  wasn t even in the base game and you call it filler lol
it s actually dlc  not part of the game
@david duggan  is the dlc part of the tlous game
@anthony m  the main story was written prior to it. it was an extra game
actually  it wasn t in the original game
@sonderdaze x  so then the beginning with joel and sara was giller because it s not directly effecting the current plot of the show   filler  has lost all meaning
facts!!!!
exactly
lol it s always been an unreasonable proposal because telling someone to  just not watch something  because they have criticisms about a show or movie is stupid. you re allowed to criticize a movie or tv show and still watch it. i mean  people do it all the time to see if the show will get better or get worse. imagine if sonic the hedgehog fans did not criticize the original cgi for sonic when the trailer came out  imagine if they  just didn t watch it   well the movie would ve bombed hard. the movie studio listened to criticism instead of just saying  don t like our sonic cgi  don t watch it   and the movie was a success because of their willingness to listen.
episode 8 finally grew a set of balls that didn t involve a tea party on the front lawn.  before ep 8  ep3 and 7 made up almost 30  of the story line.  30  of a 9 episode series was a dead end.  this was done by design.  we know this is true because ep3 director told us.   the message  takes priority over  plot progression.
and then this  filler  episode tops the charts lmao
i don t mind that they did the dlc  but no way it should have been an entire episode. they really are keeping joel on the sideline...screen time bonding time-wise. no doubt so that come season 2  the average viewer will not be as pissed off and not miss him.
this is an episode i knew was coming because i played the game.
also  you can t call this  filler  because filler is what happens when the adaptation catches up to the source material  so they have to add in things that aren t in the source material to let the source material get ahead. this is ripped straight from the source material s dlc  so it s quite literally canon
lmao i m so confused   their relationship is literally in the game    a gay filler   like what
as a straight 23 year old  you completely dropped the ball on this one  this is from the dlc.bill and franks episode destroyed me for how tragic and bitter sweet it was. i don t mind gay characters as long as the writing is well done! both so those episodes proved and executed well in my book.
episode 7...the entire episode is from the game. how is it filler   everything in the episode is from the game.
it s the audience that essentially keeps the show going....
well the episode with ellie and riley serves a purpose of developing ellie s character a lot more for the audience. the episode with bill and frank is the opposite. it s a one off episode that did nothing for the characters of this show  and was a waste because both bill and frank won t ever be revisited in the show again  or it wouldn t make sense if they did. i was hoping at least bill was left alive so he could play a bigger role in the show vs what the game had him do.
episodes did just fine. it s one of the highest rated and most watched shows  if not the most watched show ever  on hbo. in fact  i believe viewership increased week over week. in fact  after the supposed episode 3 backlash and all the predictions of the show  getting woke and going broke   the viewership continued to skyrocket. so i don t think they were going after anyone here because the episodes weren t  doing as well   on the contrary  the show has been an absolute juggernaut.
i wonder what child trauma or trauma in general you ve been through to have so much hate in you
the longer this show goes on  it brings about dejavu where i completely stopped caring about the story and went all in with the multiplayer.
they were gay in the game  if you re going to complain about them being gay in the show then don t watch  it s not an attack on fans  and it s not filler.
this comment section proves that many people who complain about the     woke     have not even opened the menu of the game... you keep arguing about nothing  apparently that s all you can do.
if you are going to observe a day of fasting please remember to drink water. thank you for the video. if i don t like a show i don t watch it. that goes for a lot of shows. don t bring  modern problems  into a historically show. just have a good story  good acting  and a good script.
i m enjoying the series  the acting and writing is some of the best we have gotten so far...we already knew elli was gay..the episode is based on the dlc of the first game  it explains elli s backstory to people who never played their game ...don t see it as a filler or forced propaganda
filler episode definition  a filler episode is one in which nothing happens to affect the progress of the long-term story arcs or to develop the main characters  and no returning side characters  or other significant persons  other than the main characters   appear. episode 3  bill and frank are used as a catalyst for joel to fight for and protect who he loves. he already failed with his daughter and with tess  he will not fail for ellie. we also see how long tess   joel and bill   frank were allies and helped each other out -- learning that bill   frank were very significant to joel   tess. the outcome is also the same in the game and in the show -- bill is used for joel and ellie to obtain a vehicle  and the end result is the same in both pieces of media. episode 7  quite literally backstory to the main character. shows how she got bit  and shows that she has been through trauma and loss before her encounters we see with joel. she could not save riley  and we see her decision for why she goes back to save joel instead of leaving like he insisted. also  this all only takes 3 weeks before the events of the last of us. in the dlc  ellie just attempts to scour an abandoned mall for medical supplies. which is better  showing background information and context about the main character  or just watching ellie run around a mall looking for supplies instead  if you prefer the latter  good for you. does not mean it is filler.both of these episodes quite literally help develop both the main story and backstory of the main characters. stop misusing the term  filler  to dismiss offhand something you just don t enjoy. and personally  regardless  i don t believe that  filler  episodes are necessarily bad in the first place anyway.
it s crazy that craig mazin managed to tell more story in 5 episodes of chernobyl than in 6  and probably all 9  episodes of tlou
-phobic backlash  is the new  you re not smart enough to understand  that books and movies used to have when it was poorly written.
lol people can like the episode and it still be filler. she s not wrong. take episode 7 out of the season and the plot and story stays exactly the same. that s filler
that s exactly why they changed joel in this show. they knew the whole joel-in-one thing would piss everyone off like it did for the game
neil druckman s design for joel was always to kill him off. when making the first game  neil was just an employee  but with the major success of the last of us part 1  sony decided to make neil the president of the studio  which cut all restraints and is why last of us 2 was so woke. neil always hated the character of joel and despised that so many fans loved joel and so he decided to kill off joel early on in part 2 in the most disrespectful way. and sonly allowed neil to spearhead the hbo show  which neil is also doing writing duties  so it comes as no surprise that neil is limiting joel s appearance   role in the show. notice that ellie goes from a smart   witty girl in the game to an annoying brat that constantly berates joel in the show. that is neil s doing. again  the creator  neil druckman  always wanted joel to die off early on  always resented that his boss at naughty dog made changes to the character that made joel popular  and when given full control over the franchise kills off joel   writes joel as a minor character in the show.
@shawn m  also  add the fact that they lied to us. in this release trailer  they had joel alive  but in the game  he was swapped out. they knew fans would not be happy  so they made it look like joel was still alive later in the game. https   youtu.be ii5usqp2jak t 139
@mrmr gaming  the story   plot of tlou2 was also leaked   it painted a terrible picture  but they tried to tell us that the leaks were all lies and for us not to believe them. the leak turned out to be 90  true. the leaks said that joel would be killed and that the game would force us to play as joel s killer. naughty dog    neil especially  tried to tell us  fans  that this was not to be believed  when it turned out to be true. the fact that they would blatantly alter the trailer to give fans a false sense of what joel s actual role was  was extremely deceptive. and i ve heard from people who tried to defend this  which is equally disturbing. and neil druckman admitted before the game s release that he knew the game  lou2  would piss off fans  but he made it anyway  proving that he doesn t give a damn about pleasing fans.
@shawn m  yeah  i saw the leaked stuff  but as in that trailer i linked  they lied. they show joel alive  yet in the game  he is long dead by then  and they swapped him out for that asian actor but with joels lines. the game was a technical marvel  but story-wise  it was terrible. in fact  once joel died  i had to push myself to even finish it. even the flashback stuff after his death felt pointless.the tv show is dropping like a stone for me. 1 and 2 were good  3 started wrong and ended wrong. as for the rest  they have been average  with a few good bits.
@mrmr gaming  i agree with you 100 .
the dlc has to be one episode because the dlc is actually pretty long as fuck.
@agherosh  the issue is  what purpose does it serve in a 9-episode season  we lost one to frank plus this one  and we have had a female boss villain taking screen time that ended up....coming to nothing.at this rate  when joel gets his crap death next season  people will be like   joel died....who was joel again  yet again  this was one of those things where they did not need to change or alter anything. no one wanted changes  we loved it so much that many of us bought it over and over again. just do the game  and you have a winner....but nooooo.
@shawn m  finally someone spitting the truth. bruce straley was actually the main game director and he would actually shoot down most of the ideas neil gave him because it was either to contrived or didn t make sense. neil actually pitched a revenge plot for one of the characters in the first game but it never came to fruition because the game had to focus on joel and ellie. it s safe to say bruce had neil on a leash for most of the development of part 1 but when bruce left  neil gained free reign to do what he wanted for the sequel. after bruce left neil took most of the credit for part 1 despite not having much of an influence on the story. that s why you rarely ever hear of bruce straley being metioned because neil painted the picture that he himself was the creator of the last of us.
it s dlc in the original game. it obviously wasn t needed to tell the amazing story in the original game. it also doesn t further the plot or story at all. so it s filler.
@lakerfan024  it is canon. something that is canon quite literally cannot be filler. if the story got confirmed by the original creator  then that makes it part of the story. can you skip it  sure. but saying that this is just  gay filler for pushing the agenda of lgbtq  representation  is quite literally the dumbest take i ve ever seen
@yaku  the fact that it s  something you could skip  is why it s filler lol just because something is cannon  doesn t mean it s not filler. plenty of  cannon  shows have filler. dragon ball z is notorious for filler episodes that are also cannon to the show. so yeah  it s filler. canon has no effect on whether something is filler or not.
@shid  thanks for reminding me of the name. i knew he was the game s director at the time but just couldn t remember his name  bruce strailey . and i suspect that amy hennig helped contribute to the overall story cause there is no way in hell that neil came up with the entire story himself. and its very telling that both bruce strailey   amy hennig left after neil was made president of the company. some say they were forced out by neil. someone who claimed to be an ex naughty dog employee said as much.
@christopher loyd  neil druckman said that the game would  piss off fans  and yet he did it anyways. that s not the actions of someone who wants to please fans  its the actions of someone who has an axe to grind and who wants to piss off fans. and since neil is helping to write the hbo show  it just proves my point that he wants to piss fans off. in the sow  ellie is constantly berating joel. why  we know why. its because neil hates that fans love joel.
@shawn m neil was not just an employee he was the director he was the director of uncharted series too alongside amy hennig.
@shawn m neil was promotrd after part 2 dude not before.he was again just director for part 2 his promotion was announced after the release of part 2 i remember.
@shawn m neils original concept for the last of us 1 had a revenge plot but joel was never set to die unless you have solid proof and since thus far your comment seems to have some misinfo the whole he wanted joel to die early is still speculation.neil isn t a great creator sure he has clear issues but like people are just saying whatever now.
@chandller burse  wrong  neil was promoted well before lou part 2.
@chandller burse  my proof comes from neil s own mouth. he gave a speech praising anita sarkeesian and crediting her for helping influence him on last of us part 2. he also went over his original design for lou part 1  where he went over his original design   said that he originally wanted the character of ellie s protector to die. he wasn t even going to call him  joel . the video has been on youtube  go look for it. its a speech neil gave talking about how he created lou1 while accepting some award   praising woke activist anita sarkeesian.
@shawn m  can you source this
@shawn m  okay but what about the whole neil was just an employee  he was the director of both games.
@shawn m  personally i don t really care if joel died the issue was never his death per say its how its done anyways.but knowing neil i am not sure what he wanted for these games.i blame him for nd basically acting like the last of us is the only series they ever made.they seem to forget about jak and others.
@chandller burse  you are correct  he was the creative director on both games  but that is still an  employee.  i was just having a slight mental block at the time of writing  so i just said  employee.  technically i wasn t wrong. but thanks for the correction.
@shawn m  i mean yes but there is another comment you made where you said he was kept in check by the director when he was the director.i never understood how developers work this way its odd how fast neil was put on the uncharted series as director when he was just a programmer on jak 3 and supposedly he bugged andy gavin into even giving him the job but idk.
since ellie and riley had a whole dlc dedicated to them why not an episode  what s wrong with that
@daury davis  the show is 9 episodes. they lost one to frank and one to the dlc.they introduced a female villain boss  gave her screen time and killed her.they are doing as much as they can to reduce joel s bonding time with ellie. in fact  they seem to be reducing joel from the lead wherever they can. it s no doubt to reduce the upcoming death. people will not miss him if they reduce his screen time and bonding.
@mrmr gaming  they had to adapt and make changes because as a fan i don t wanna know everything that s happening in a show
@mrmr gaming  it would be boring if i could guess everything in the show
@dakoata  sadly  when they make shows films based on games  it s not for the fans. they want to take an appealing story that made money and release something that appeals to the mass market  most of whom have never heard of the last of us.that is the 1st stumbling block  just how much do they remove add change in order to gain the average person. the next stumbling block is how much do they screw with for no good reason bar political media backlash....or praise.the final stumbling block is writer s ego. this is where writers believe they can improve on something that is noted as a masterpiece.most of the time  these things kill shows films for fans. it s very rare when we get something that is untouched or messed with and for the 1st two episodes  i did think we might have one of those rare gems  but it seems they were just winning the fans over before dropping the ball.
@mrmr gaming  they been true to the game though and didn t really change much of the story they have to change some parts because as someone who s played the game many times if i knew what was coming everytime i d prolly just drop the show but the shows doing good and they don t need to add action all the time because it ll take away from the main point of the story which is the building of joel s and ellie s relationship it s also a show so they don t need to throw in every ep action to keep people focused like they would in the game.
@dakoata  i am sorry  i have yet to see any fan of something say  omg  they did everything that the game book did. it was all 100  there  and that spoiled it for me .lotr. most read book of all time  so a few people knew what was to come. they never changed much  just dropped a few bits due to time money and been a bit ott for a normal audience.episodes 1 and 2 were good  3 started wrong mid  was good  and it ended wrong.4 5 6 7 have been average  with some good bits. they have wasted time on filler and reduced time on bonding. as i said  this is by design because the studio knows that if people bonded with the tv show as they did with the game  when they kill joel  people will kick off and turn off. they want him as there  but not a linchpin  so when he goes  it will not have the same impact and  they hope  the show numbers don t dive.if you love it  that is all that matters to you  and that is fine  but to me  it s good  but not close to how good it should have been.
@shid  saying bruce was the real director and not co director is like how people are so pissed to this day at the dead bob kane for being a bit of a gloryhound and taking all credit for batman.even though without both you would not have the same product if the product at all.
@shawn m  suspecting is not proving.the idea that neil had no real contribution is odd even if it was unused and minor again the bob kane and bill finger thing.people say bob did nothing yet if he did nothing there would be no batman name or character.and finger would have no character to develop further with his designs.i just don t like this crap give credit where credit is due at least.even if neil is sort of dumb.
i think it can be an entire episode but the real problem i have with it is that they cut out all of the fun parts of the dlc  like alot of the rest of the show. they should ve gone back and forth between the flashback storyline and the current day storyline when ellie is fending for herself trying to find medicine whilst being hunted by people in the mall. that way it adds a good blend of a slower paced more story heavy arc and a faster paced more action heavy arc. like most other shows do. it was honestly such a fuckin joke that the entire episode had one single infected in it  didn t even get the chase scene with the horde
@britzz  yeah  when they get to bits  that should be good...they fall flat. take episode 8  blink  and you miss everything. that camp should have been over 2 episodes. they wasted time on stuff that was meaningless in past episodes and never gave time to parts that really needed it.
having morals and standards
@nostalgic bliss  oh  hating others for shit that doesn t concern you is  moral  these days
@nostalgic bliss  morals and standards like
@dakoata   standing against depravity and perversion
@nostalgic bliss  oh so ur cool with gay people then
@nostalgic bliss  cuz as far as i m concerned being gay has nothing to do with anything u said
@nostalgic bliss  but i m pretty sure god don t like discrimination so there s a spot in hell for bigots
@dakoata
@chandller burse  don t know what you re talking about lol
@nostalgic bliss  i don t think anyone does here knows what they are saying part of the time.
@chandller burse   part of being in a simulation
@nostalgic bliss  i hate the matrix.keanu reeves should be ashamed of himself for this internet culture he s inadvertently created.
her past long relationship left her traumatized for reasons we don t know. but the change is obvious because we all know how melonie was few years back. now she s a complete right-wing unhinged person that only finds people like thequartering to hang out with. it s sad and disturbing where trauma and depression can push a person.
@nostalgic bliss  if you d know anything about her you d knew she went through a traumatic experience in her past relationship which ended few years back. it s no coincidence she became a full right-wing spinner since then.
@julian left  how was she a few years back  i don t agree with all her takes  i think the woke vs anti woke wars is kinda silly. but i do agree that certain acts are an abomination. transexuality and homosexuality.
melonie was fired from her gaming entertainment job she had so now she s making hate videos on youtube of shows with minorities in it for money.  and sadly it s working otherwise she would ve stopped by now.
how do you think she gets the click s
it absolutely was a filler episode. they could ve devoted 20 minutes of the episode to riley   ellie not 50 minutes of the episode .  20 minutes of riley   ellie would have been ample with the rest of the episode devoted to the adventures of joel and ellie.
@drew kiely   the adventures of joel and ellie  while he s dying from a stab wound  bruh lmaooo
lol
@drew kiely  the dlc took 3 hrs  the episode cut out a lot
@drew kiely  if it was only 20 minutes it would ve been rushed and not had as much emotion
@dimitri show  doesn t matter to me if you re gay or not  i was just replying to the comment you made because it s silly. and if you are gay  you should know gay people exist just as much as straight people do. there s no backlash to straight relationships in absolutely every piece of media  why backlash just because they re gay  it literally affects and changes nothing
@dimitri show  saying how you don t care if someone is gay or trans  and then going into saying how  normal people don  t like being force-fed ideas   solely because a piece of media is portraying a gay relationship  is quite literally the definition of being homophobic. when you are watching a piece of media with a straight relationship  and has a man and woman end up falling in love  do you believe you are being force-fed ideas  do you believe they are treating straight relationships as being  special  or wanting to be  treated differently   you re quite literally stating how straight is  normal  and being gay is not. gay relationships being portrayed so often in media is to quite literally show how normal it is -- just like straight relationships.
it was filler in the game  initially rejected from the main game  and it was filler in the show.
@dimitri show  well  whether you  like it or not   gay people have been around just as long as straight people have -- they ve just spent majority of their life being discriminated against for it  that s why gay relationships being portrayed in media was so rare. so now that they re getting their inclusion  everyone has their panties in a twist. straight couples in media still exist -- saying every single piece of media has been riddled by  gay  is overexaggerating. just because a gay relationship is being portrayed in any form  does not mean they re  force-feeding   trying to  indoctrinate   or trying to get special attention for it. and just because i m pointing out the hypocrisy between straight relationships portrayed in media vs gay relationships doesn t mean i m  straight phobic   either. as long as a relationship is consensual  i don t understand the issue. it s not like media is trying to portray any of my personal relationships -- but people act as if that is what is happening when they see a gay couple.
i mean yeah but you gotta admit regardless a lot of this show has felt like filter. and it s not very intelligently written  every episode is introducing some new character to get you attached to and then some fucked up stuff at the end and one of said characters dying lol every episode has played the same so far and it started out strong for me now i m kind of meh about it
@frank w  i mean  understandable  but theyre just following the way the game went. you meet someone  you get invested in their story  they die and or you never see or hear from them again lol
@meg  right but this is where i m fine with creative freedom  at least build these relationships for more than one episode and across a season but if the game has the same pace i guess i get it
@dimitri show  so how do you balance stories if you don t let the  gays  catch up  its like saying  yo no more black protagonist movies cus not everyone is black  like literally out of the most popular shows right now  2 or 3 out of them have gay characters  and most of those gay characters are either not mc or just a second mc  and being gay is not the story  so idk what you mean with them being gay is propaganda  or trying to force ideas  its literally telling a story where a character happens to be gay  so you know when people see gay people on the street  they see them as people  and not as something  bad  as it currently is in most of the americas at least
@dimitri show  also no one has ever said that you are better for being gay  or special  people generally say that its ok to also be that  which might not be where you are from  but most parts of the world its something that s frown upon  like literally you see people saying that they rather have a criminal for a son  than them being gay  so yeah  trying to normalize being gay its not cheap propaganda  i could agree with you that some companies use it for cheap points  but that s not saying anything new
@dimitri show  sorry i didnt read your comment updating your point  have a nice one
it s not filler   take the entire episode 7 out  which was dlc in the game  and pretend it never was shown .the story and plot of the show stays exactly the same. that s literally why it s filler filler is something that doesn t further the plot or story. knowing that backstory doesn t move the plot one bit. ellie and joel are still in the situation they were in at the end of episode 6.
i don t care if they gay i just want show to be just like the game but they changing too much barely any action low budget   more gay moments and jump skips
@blad89 s   low budget  did people even look up how much the series cost   10-15 million per episode that is 80-100  million for the season making it as expensive as the final seasons of got. budget in films series goes into way more than action explosions   lots of the sets were built from scratch including entire abandoned neighborhoods lots of the parts with infected were a mix of practical and vfx requiring a lot of extras and stunts on set.
it s not about them being gay you can have gay characters and still have a good show that doesn t focus specifically on that. especially when it comes to riley she should have been left as a memory not portrayed like this.
@mister pinkman  i honestly have gotten tired of characters being gay. it is used all the time. i don t care if it was in the game  it just means they were just as unoriginal as their peers when making it.you are supposed to write what you know. so... what does this obsession with sexuality say about the writers  especially as we are constantly talking about characters being gay  and not about anything else of the story
@lakerfan024  character development is still important. this episode is ellie s life before she met joel  and it explains a lot about her. she is also one of the main characters throughout this show. so again  how is this filler
@sirirond  did you read my comment correctly i said i don t care if they re gay i just want the show to be like the game they ve been changing many things it s fast pace rushed the last of us world doesn t feel dangerous. you talk about gay moments they had an entire episode of two dudes living in a house what could ve been an action scene from the game but i m weird make it make sense the game exists the show was supposed to be for the fans it would of still gathered new fans without the gay stuff
hands down the most boring episode. you don t lose much by scrapping the episode. to me  that is definition of filler
@fikile mkhize that episode was based off the dlc of the game  but of course a non gamer wouldn t know that
literally. lol this episode was literally a dlc for the game back i m 2014.   i love to see them cope though
this show has never been good and it has nothing to do with this episode or episode 3 these episodes just made it worse!
actually a good comment for once.
@amador cortinas  for you not for other people just cause you don t like it doesn t mean is a bad show.
imagine supporting gays in 2023
@horseradish power  because loving people is such a bad thing  right  i never will get homophobia bruh. the fact that they call it propaganda is hurting my heart ngl. no one is forcing people to be gay here and no one ever did.
@horseradish power  i have never seen a company  or literally anyone saying in order to be special  you need to be gay etc. people who say these are the people that just gets annoyed by the community. also  just because homophobia is not really a thing in ur own state that much or environment. there s still hard homophobia in other parts of the world. so the reason being why everyone is still fixated on the lgbtqia community  is because they re still trying to end homophobia. that s why it s kinda embedded im everything nowdays  even in politics. which sadly needs to be a political topic .if you wonder why gay people fixated with their own sexuality so much  that is why. because they re trying to make a difference and live the way they want. i am gay myself  and although i never advertise it anywhere  i still am fixated on it constantly because my life revolves around who i love. people can hate me for it  or kill me for it. while straight people don t get killed cuz of who they love. so when i hear what this woman is saying i do get frustrated quite a bit. it s not a matter of free speech  it s a matter of being uneducated and spreading hate speech. even though she s not a doctor or a professional health advisor she s labeling people as mentally ill while wanting their rights removed. and then she has the audacity to say  it s just my opinion  you can do whatever you want  this hypocritical statement is in every conservative s talking mechanism.  you shouldn t wear girl s clothing if you re male and vise versa because you will be an abomination  idk why christians fixated on the bible so much when they don t even live by the rules  but they can surely mock you and scold you if you do something out of line. even though that exact thing is in the bible saying we shouldn t judge others  and that only god should judge others but they don t give a crap about that. most christians are just the most hateful persons on the world  i have seen so many that i just lost count.
thank you
actually it s not filler  it s called shoving their agenda down people s throats.
@mark clotworthy  is there a reason you feel angry seeing consensual relationships that don t involve you portrayed in media  it s not even like you can use the excuse that they made characters gay for tv - these same characters have been gay for 10 years since the game released.  and guess what  gay people have been around way longer than that  too .
lol episode 7 doesn t develop the backstory of ellie  the story stayed the same with or without episode 7  that s why it was dlc. we already knew from the early episodes that ellie was bitten but immune. knowing about the details of how she got bit and that she had a relationship in the past doesn t do anything to grow ellie as a character. you don t need that to know why she went back for joel. the game made that clear through dialogue between her and joel. so yep  it is filler.
@lakerfan024  the left behind dlc was there to add to ellie s character arc. it s a bit asinine to think showing ellie s backstory doesn t help develop anything  it s very important when you take into account the entire story of the last of us universe  and this story is ultimately all about ellie. if you read my definition of a filler episode  it quite literally says  nothing happens to affect progress of long-term story arc or develop the main characters.
@lakerfan024  left behind is extremely important to the story s narrative. in terms of context  it s essential in understanding the story of ellie. we re also getting a flashback to ellie s mother in the finale -- would you consider that filler  then  we are already aware that ellie s mom is dead and that marlene took over - does that mean we shouldn t see that  either  because i m quite excited to watch it.
@meg  knowing ellie s past doesn t affect ellie s current self. you understand that  right  for ellie  this event has already happened. it s already affected her and made her grow. us  as the audience seeing that  does not grow ellie in the present day of the show. her walking around with joel and then remembering about her past doesn t grow her while she s with joel. the experience in the past grew her when it happened you know what would have grown ellie  if she  oh i don t know  loses joel in the present day  get it now for the character ellie  that event of the dlc has already affected and grown her character. in last of us 2  the even of joel s death isn t a flashback of something that s already happened to ellie  for ellie joel s death is happening for the first time. that s growth.
@meg  and yes even a flashback to ellie s mother is filler because again  take out episode 7 entirely and tell me if the plot or story or character of ellie changes at all. nothing. the story is still the same  the plot is still the same  and ellie still acts the same has the same personality that she had. again  us knowing about ellie s past doesn t change how ellie acts in the present day. not one bit. so the episode 7 info doesn t change ellie  it changes our perception of her since we know why she acts the way she does in the present day now imagine that episode 7 was not a flashback and the entire episode took place in present day in the show. that would ve actually not been filler  because that event would be affecting ellie in the present day. knowing why ellie is the way she is doesn t change how she is. knowing why joel is the way he is doesn t change how he is either.
@lakerfan024  so you re saying any show that gives backstory to the main character means that episode is filler if it s something we could already gather by dialogue  and you think ellie s experience with riley doesn t affect how she acts present day  it quite literally adds to her character arc - her fear of being alone  survivor s guilt  and motivation to make the vaccine -- it adds to why she becomes so devastated when joel lies to her. she was quite literally about to walk out like joel insisted during winter when she remembers riley and her words. you don t have to like it  and i do agree we need more than 9 episodes to showcase the entirety of this story -- but to call it filler is a bit silly. the literal definition of filler means it does not add anything to the main characters or all encompassing story.
@meg  one more example for you so i m clear imagine that i m your friend. you know i m very easily angered and defensive all the time. then i tell you my backstory  or in other words i tell you about my past. knowing my past let s you understand why i am the way i am. you knowing about why i am defensive and easily angered doesn t change how i act. it just helps you understand why i act that way. see now  us as the viewers knowing about why ellie acts the way she does  that knowledge of her past does not change ellie in the show. for ellie  that event has changed her years ago when it happened. now  all the people that ellie loses that she tried to help in the episodes that were set in present day do affect ellie and grow her.
@lakerfan024  i wouldn t consider you giving me your backstory as to why you re angry and defensive as filler  either - it s important context as to why you re angry and defensive. you can give as many examples as you like  but i still believe showing a main character s backstory does not define as filler. we hear riley s name in the first episode and for anyone who hasn t played the game  they have no idea who she is.  devising backstories is a crucial part of character creation since a character s background will inform the action of the main narrative. writing character backstories can be part of the worldbuilding process. it s a way to create fully formed characters who resemble real people with nuanced personality traits.  we can agree to disagree at this point.
@meg  did you not understand what i said  ellie s backstory in the dlc gives us an explanation of why ellie acts the way she does. but for ellie in episodes 6 and episode 8  she experienced that event years ago  meaning it s already grown her as a person get it now  that info helps us as the viewers understand ellie  but the events that it shows already literally happened to ellie years before the events of episodes 1-6. that s why it s filler. if you erase episode 7 from the whole season  ellie will still act the same exact way that she acted in episode 6. that s because the events of episode 7 didn t directly affect how she acted in episode 8. so that is why episode 7 was filler. take that episode away  and ellie would act similar or the same in episode 8 as she acted in episode 6 before it. again  here s a present day example in the show. remember all the people this season that ellie has lost after getting close to  yeah those are present day events that did grow ellie during the show. because for ellie and us as the viewers  ellie was experiencing losing those people for the first time   so the viewers got to see ellie react to losing those people and grow too. these events of the season  except for episode 7  had all happened to ellie for the first time. they weren t flashbacks or memories  viewers got to see her experience loss and grow from it during that same time that she was with joel. by the way  the all capital letters is for emphasis  not anger
@lakerfan024  dude what does it matter that the event took place in the past  past     filler  the episode isn t there for ellie to understand herself  it s there for us viewers to see why she s that way. literally do not understand what you re trying to get at by explaining these events took place in the past - they re still important context to the main characters and by that definition does not mean it s filler lol
@lakerfan024  episode 4 was more filler than 3 and 7
@meg  it s filler because it didn t change anything in the show . again  i can t believe i m having to repeat this. take out episode 7 totally. pretend it never existed. then look at episode 6 and then episode 8. what changed without episode 7 between them  nothing. the story is at the same place. the plot is the same. ellie is the same. all those things from the end of episode 6 are still the same at the beginning of episode 8. that s filler. it didn t change ellie. the version of ellie from episode 1 was already affected by it years ago when the events of episode 7 actually happened to her for the first time. us learning about it now has absolutely no affect on ellie s growth as a character during her time with joel. she was already affected by that and had grown from it before she even met joel  and the reason i keep bringing that up is because you claimed that episode 7 is not filler. i showed why it is filler because you could easily erase the whole episode and nothing would change from episode 6 to episode 8.your own definition of  filler  says it s when the plot or story isn t really advanced forward or when the characters do not have growth.. i just showed how there was neither story progression nor character growth as a result of episode 7
@lakerfan024  that s not what filler means. filler means it s unimportant to the main character s arc. you re really gonna hate season 2 with all the flashbacks with joel and ellie  huh
@dean gagatr  doubtful. 3 and 7 were both essentially flashbacks that had no real effect on the story. the only thing that happened in 3 was joel and ellie got the truck they needed. bill and frank were both dead by the time joel and ellie got there so that whole story about their relationship also had no effect on the story or plot.
@meg  so you re just gonna disregard your own definition  i just showed how your definition of filler applies to episode 7 and yet you re ignoring your own definition because of that  episode 7 didn t affect the story s progress at all and it didn t grow ellie in the present day  yet  you keep acting like it s not filler interesting.  filler means it s unimportant to the main characters arc  yeaaaaah  except that s not the definition you gave.  also  nice strawman. i never said flashbacks were all bad or all filler. i said that entire episodes devoted to flashbacks are by definition   filler . you re welcome to show how i m wrong about the definition you used for filler is applicable to episode 7  but so far all you ve done is ask why i care about it.
@lakerfan024  your entire argument for why episode 7 was filler is because it happened in the past and because it does not affect ellie present day. how would joel and ellie s flashback scenes in season 2 not constitute as filler then as well  by your definition  they could be removed and the story would still progress the same  like you said. i already explained multiple times why episode 3 and 7 affected the over-arching story and backstories for joel and ellie and how a filler episode literally means  nothing happens to affect the progress of the long-term story arcs or to develop the main characters.  showing the audience how ellie got bit and that she s gay  which is quite obviously going to be shown in season 2  is not filler if it is relevant to the main characters.
@lakerfan024  something being important to the main character s arc quite literally falls under  develop the main characters  lol. how do you develop a character  with them having an arc..... the definition of filler does not say anywhere  entire episodes dedicated to flashbacks   you made that one up. if that s your definition for it  that s fine - doesn t affect me in any way or that those episodes are important context for the story.
@meg  okay so how is ellie being bitten in the past and losing riley in the past affect her character arc in the present  ellie in episode 1 is the same ellie in episode 6 and episode 8  regardless of whether episode 7 was included or not. the only difference between ellie s character in episode 8 than how she acted in episode 1 is a result of what happened in the current day since she started her journey with joel. you ve tip toed around explaining that. an  arc  takes place in the present. for example  part of joel s character arc is him from going to harsh and distrusting to being able to open up and raise ellie like she s his own daughter. this takes place in the present from episode 1 and on throughout the season that is a character arc because it s happening during the present day. again  take away episode 7 and ellie would act the same way in episode 8 that she acted in episode 6. you keep ignoring that simple but obviously true fact
@lakerfan024  where did i say  bad  anywhere  my og comment literally says that i personally don t think filler episodes are necessarily  bad  in the first place anyway. maybe don t put words in my mouth  the only thing we have been arguing is what the definition of what a filler episode is. i do not believe these fall under the definition of filler given the definition on google for the reasons given in my og comment  which i m not bothering to repeat anymore. like i said multiple comments ago  agree to disagree.
@meg  alright my mistake. i apologize. i misread and thought you were saying something you weren t. and sure we can agree to disagree at this point. i think we ve both said plenty. i just think the episode was filler. that doesn t mean it s a  bad  episode  just that it is classified as filler. anyways  again i want to reiterate that boldface and all capital letters were not meant to convey anger. i use all capital letters to convey emphasis  so don t think i am mad at you or anything. have a good one.
@mark clotworthy  gay people exist it isn t a agenda it s reality and human connection
you just told a better story with one sentence
but he s following the story of the game
@somanytakennames  didn t say he wasn t
@somanytakennames  he s adapting the game while adding more lore to the game and the characters  speccially joel and ellie  while it doesn t take that makes tlou so special
the bill episode definitely seems to be filler.but i don t think this new episode is filler due to it being from the dlc  left behind  and it explains how ellie got her bite and when she realized she was immune.
i have loved the first 2 episodes  third ep. was like wth  4 and was like good but not super great  6 was boring and 7 was ok. they deviated the centered plot to mainly be a drama focused show and the action and horror of that you got from the game has been severely toned down to the point of not being important. its like the directors said you really want drama  you don t really need all this thrilling action and horror.
my brother wanted a barbie doll when he was little. my dad wouldn t go for it at all until he finally realized he wanted the barbie doll because he was pretending to be king kong and the barbie was jessica lange.
i can t wait to see abby   dina in the second season!! i m so hyped
the episode with bill was more or less to expand on a character that you just brush past in the game. the left behind dlc for the most part was a good adaptation of what happens in the game with of course some changes to bring it to a streaming service.for the bill episode it would have pushed the shows budget way beyond scope if they did a 1 to 1 of what happened in the game. running through a cemetery with clickers  to fighting outside of a school against infected then being chased in that school  then also fighting through the school  then fighting a bloater to escaping.i don t know i feel like you haven t played the game.it wasn t an issue when the game released but it is now that the hbo show is out. i get it is your opinion but i just don t think it is that deep.i feel like you and the hogwarts legacy harassment mob are pretty similar when it comes to your viewers. just different sides of the same coin and all that.
they re gay in the dlc this is nothing new. but as always  representation is here to stay! so stay tuned in cause we all know you will !
me watching breaking bad for the 10th time.
i didn t give this series a chance because i knew this was going to happen.  don t like it  don t watch it.  your proposal is acceptable.
i just discovered your channel! definitely agree on reading your bible more can change your mood and let alone out look on life
preach!  i like you more and more the more i watch.
dlc was a bonus game and was very popular  so inclusion in the show at the right spot make sense. bill frank was an opportunity given in the game frank was bill s partner with plenty of hints of being a romantic partner. 7   lgbtq population is average  but in the regions where creatives are concentrated  west los angeles hollywood  san francisco   lgbtq are way higher.  seems like everyone have at least one friend or relative that s an lgbtq.
you re 36 and divorced for a reason lmao.
only  50  lol i meant to give u  100  just wanna show how grateful i am for everything u do i got ur back sis imma always support u
every time someone said something along these lines  it always came back and bit them in the ass.
yes meta pc. code mac. hope you re well melonie
finally i feel represented!  im not going to lie  it feels darn good.  so god bless em
being mediocre and a victim while trying to raise status through woke bullet points is her brand. you can t criticise her for her craft without being treated as an attack on her umbrella of activism.
all gay fillers  all the time  said no one.
the problem with representation is that  when i don t feel represented  why should i watch this
yes! no excuses! preach on preach-ah!!! thank you so much!!!!
yeah but that is the last thing they cared about when writing this episode. it is filler because its not the main story.
same
same!! luv my girl dina
@squirrelbeez  dina is the moment
people are gonna get really mad when she comes lol
@daury davis  they ll have to cope
you shouldn t need to play the game. that s not the point of the show.
@first last  it is an adaptation of the game. it is the point. of course you don t need to play the game but it is based off the source material. or would you rather it be another halo where the source material is thrown so far aside it might as well be a different show
@cat streams  no  you don t need to play the game - it s a completely separate medium with a separate target audience  even if there are overlaps  this is for different media consumers your argument fails when you tell someone to go to the source - this also fails with book adaptations as well. the adaption should work on it s own merits. then again  this is going to be a show just like multiple other shows where people look back and say  okay yeah  that actually wasn t very good  - it already has piss poor pacing.
@first last  i didn t say you needed to play the game. i said it was an adaptation of the game. how did you take the word adaptation and twist it into play of course it will be based on the source material. unless you genuinely enjoyed the resident evil movies  halo and the dribble that uwe boll produced just please stop.what you are asking for is to totally change characters for boomer benefits.halo is already a flop because it tried to change so much for a different audience.when is alienating the core audience a good idea  it never works.but don t try and put words in my mouth i never said you had to play the game. it is already an adaptation of the game. taking something and turning it into something else. in this case a game to a series.you seem to be the kind of person that sees a new word and assume what it means. adaptation does not mean  play
@first last  nice turning of the tables. so its ok to ignore the game when it ignores your alignment and ideology but you need to follow the source material when your alignment and ideology match  keep sinking lower
@talentroller 44  i don t know who you re arguing with  but it s not me.
no joke  i ve seen that show from beginning to end like 5 times ahahahaha
now that there is a good show.
@lingr icen  you have terrible taste if you think breaking bad is bad. thanks for telling us your taste is bad.
@lingr icen  yes.
@lingr icen  so you have terrible taste
every show these days is the same. starts strong  usually 1 good episode to hook people in  maybe 2  befote descending into unwatchable agenda driven crap.
she was referring to people who are homophobic not in general.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  no this is a go-to line they throw when any criticism of any kind is thrown at them.
exactly. dont even hate watch. let the thing crater. not that networks will learn a lesson  but stop feeding them views when you know they re just gonna insult the audience or bastardize your fav game or movie
@lance baylis  but this wasnt the case. this episode was faithful to the source material  its the dlc. the bill   frank episode...that was awful and boring.
@tkdboy1889  do you mean homophobic invective  that is not criticism.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  using buzzwords doesn t work. try harder bro.
did you not play the game  it s not like they changed her character to be gay. they literally had a shorter game in between 1 and 2 that this was adapted from.
exactly! hence the shows success  a lot of gay people started watching so the viewership doubled and will soon triple. makes sense that it s there  and being in love is a big thing for ellie s character. along with just. love  in general.
@josh  except they didn t bastardize the material. this is taken directly from the game. no critical thinking skills at all.
@noticias honestas  the bill and frank ep was also adapted from the game  they just expanded on what was there in the game. i will agree it was still boring though.
last episode was all  in game so i really don t see what people s problem is. tbh bills episode wasn t as bad as i thought it was gonna b still would have liked it more source for material episode 3 but i ain t gonna cry bout it
tf are yall complaining for this shit was in the dam game. we alll knew elli was gay so dont act surprised. if they would of changed it then yall would be complaining that they changed the story
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  if a show features crappy writing and insufferable characters  and just happens to include some gay characters  it s not  homophobic  to say the show has terrible writing. it s not  homophobic  to say a character is irritating and insufferable due to their choices and personality  just because they happen to be lgbt. being gay doesn t make you immune to critique. it s a deflection by you a well as the creators. got a poorly made character  just say they are part of a  marginalized  group  then insist all criticism is just hatred for that group.it s time to accept a few things. one  just because a character is lgbt or a minority doesn t immediately make them a good or likable person. two  homophobia is not a thing. we don t have a psychological fear of gays  we simply do not agree with their views. that s not a phobia. three  everything is open to criticism. people need to stop being so sensitive.
@lance baylis  100  the tactics use to draw people in they know that might not want to watch because of certain content.
exactly! advice followed.
@boss ross  people are homophobic all the time though  like the people who have disliked this show for its game content  you are not making much sense.
@c  how can you say its adapted when what happened in the game isn t even close to the show frank was already dead in the game and he admits to bill in a letter he was beginning to resent their relationship and isolation.and bill acts like a paranoid ass about everything.its not really taken from the game at all from what i heard.
@tkdboy1889 yeah.  don t like it  don t watch it! oh  you didn t watch it ! you re a homophobe!
anyone who gave it a chance knowing the game but expecting to be different from it are just too gullible.
nobody cares  it still has so many millions of episodes
@c  even though both characters appeared and were a couple  they made their relationship the whole episode. but it felt like a was watching a sunday tv romantic drama that is not the kind of show i d watch. im interested in bill interacting with joel and ellie  not about how he was given a bj by frank. you could have the story outside the last of us universe  and it wouldnt have changed that much. and by killing them both  it wasnt an expansion  it was more like a detour. also  them living in almost a paradise for that long destroyed my suspension of disbelief.
did you know this was going to happen because it happened in the game and you played the game
@lance baylis  it s literally in the source material
news flash  the show is a hit  just like house of the dragon and many other shows you labelled woke  all hits. there s nothing wrong with the gay characters on the show  the problem is you getting triggered and outraged by gays on any screen. you ll grow out of it.
@tkdboy1889  except the writing is great so what s your problem
@chandller burse  bill and franks episode is the farthest they gone to the game. no action but it does tell a nice love story and it also plays into joel s character bill did his job in protecting frank while joel failed in protecting tess. the ep is more of putting a mirror infront of joel. it also does tie in how joel and bill meet. and it does progress the story without showing the main characters. joel still gets the truck in the end so it doesn t really matter how he got it
@dakoata  in this day and age being called a bigot is a badge of honor because that word gets thrown around so much it means nothing anymore. these days anyone who disagrees with someone is a  bigot.
@tkdboy1889  the word is only used to describe people who discriminate against other people based on race cultural gender sex and sexuality  racist and homophobic people  if ur proud to be called a bigot then u just need help
@tkdboy1889   two  homophobia is not a thing. we don t have a psychological fear of gays  - don t build a strawman on the  phobia.  the term  xenophobia  has been around for a long time  probably since 1880   but it s not a psychological condition  just a category of intolerance. we simply do not agree with their views.  - on what  exactly it s a rhetorical question. wouldn t it be more accurate to say that you object to certain behavior  but saying that might make you seem overbearing  hence the more passive framing that rather misses the mark.
@dakoata  except everyone gets called a bigot now regardless of what they do. for example  many people who have played hogwarts legacy have been harassed  bullied  and called bigots even though they never bring up the trans community. all they do is a play a video game.you all are the ones who need help  clinging onto that word. it s like the terms sexist  racist  homophobe  and all those others. they just get flung out when someone says they support a product that happens to be  wrong   or dare to enjoy something others don t.
@tkdboy1889  it s because the creator of hog warts made a transphobic comment. i don t agree with people being harassed and bullied.
@tkdboy1889  but making a transphobic comment is bigoted the creator is a bigot for that comment.
@dakoata   does that justify harassing other people who just want to play a game and have no dog in the trans community
@tkdboy1889  i just said i don t support the harassment and bullying of content creators who just played the game now calling the creator of hogwarts a bigot is fine
@tkdboy1889  but does being gay justify discrimination    because people hated ep 3 because of its  woke agenda  when the shows just being true to the game
the show is good
aw shucks thank you
@melonie mac go boom  oh u r very welcome i ll be dropping by later to give u the rest lol
the first part of your sentence can be use on any of your political spokesperson lol  like you guys are literally as annoying and crybaby about things as sjw were and still are  talk about becoming what you hate dang
she was talking about the homophobes. she didn t claim to be a  victim .
@sirirond  what
it s shocking how little you know about everything
@zaxo  thanks for the translation   english is not mine primary languege.
what matters is that is lore friendly . as someone who played both parts   making ellie anything but gay would ve been an insult to millions of gamers who enjoyed that game. how would you feel if they turned ellie into a straight person tho just askin.
@el mehdi ben hadj  they would be praising the show for  breaking  the agenda
@sirirond  tbh if they didn t make bill or ellie true to the story i d have started a riot . ellie is such a well written charachter .
@sirirond  fr  these people just want to be pandered to and are too cowardly or unaware of themselves to admit it. if a conservative show told their viewers  if you don t like it  don t watch  this same crowd would be clapping like trained seals.
and about 2  of the population is getting about 98  of the representation.
like wokeonda  bros  and woman s basketball.i am not black  gay  nor a woman  so don t blame me for not watching those
@steven sun  please be joking
amen thanks for speaking the truth.
in the first game  it was more a friendship kiss. i didn t really know she was gay until the second game.
been catching up on other shows  so not had a chance to watch last of us. thank you stormy and bella for giving me a reason to not even bother!
if i don t watch it  how do i know i like it or not
the last of us left behind was in the game too but this felt like a  boring episode
eventually studios are going to start putting it in contracts of those associated with a project that they re not allowed to say on social media  interviews  etc.  if you don t like it don t watch it.  or some other variation with that sentiment.
the problem is the episode 3 storyline wasn t what happened in the game but left behind was what happened in the game
the only problem in the serie for me is the lack of action in some episode  but story telling is great.
one of the things you should never say as an actor actress is  if you don t like it  don t watch it.  you literally just sabotaged your show movie and your money. it s like nobody is teaching them this lesson or they re not learning from how other celebrities ruin their careers with that sentence alone
so refreshing. keep up the sanity
i was going to stick through with the show until the end but now   your terms are acceptable
don t like it  don t watch it i accept your terms
the hbo show is fitting right in with neil druckmann s secret agenda.  no surprise there
note  written before 4 minutes in.  i have thought a lot on this  and posted such on another critique of tlou show. i did not play the game  so i am coming at this from a straight viewer point of view.  no pun intended  enter bill in the 3rd episode. back story  he is a competent survivalist prepper living alone. he builds himself an awesome post apocalyptic fort and has a comfortable life but is alone. enter henry  and they immediately hit it off and build a beautiful life together. the viewer becomes invested and intrigued. how will they fit in to the over all story   sadly  they don t. in the end they commit joint suicide  and are downgraded to a truck and battery so joel and ellie can go on with the story. huh  really  now for another wasted episode on ellie s  how i got infected  episode. we meet riley  another bad ass character  who escapes fedra and joins the fire flies. another love story episode  that ends without moving the story forward. why kill riley  why not  oh no ellie got bit  let me take you to the fire fly leaders  which would explain ellie s start in the series. riley was being shipped out  and they could have circled her back to save the day at some point and reunite lost love. but no  we do not even get that much respect. just another dead end episode. that is why viewers are getting upset. the in your face agenda is just an easy conduit for the youtube critics to hit upon. gay or straight  these 2 episodes just wasted our time.  note  adding this 13 minutes in  the actress playing riley says there are bigger things to worry about than gay characters. yeah  like in this post apocalyptic world with fungus zombies running around killing everyone  your character lights up a whole mall supposedly infested  and your character and ellie just party down all night with out a care in the world  until finally one zombie fungus thing shows up. i watched the whole episode thinking it was going to pull a walking dead on me. you know  in walking dead  when characters just forgot where they were and held close personal conversations and they panned the camera in  and bam! out of nowhere a walker strikes  and your like holy snap! you know when the walking dead was good. and should i add back in that riley as a character had little to know point as a character as she was killed off in less than one episode. the character meant nothing.
kelly sue deconnick - if you don t like my politics  don t buy my bookeveryone else - challenge acceptedtlou actress - if you don t like it  don t watcheveryone else - challenge accepted
filler  left behind very much part of game dlc so for me unlike episode 3 it was not filler and for me it was done pretty well
challenge accepted
to be fair this episode was actually in the game at least  the one with bill and frank wasn t in the game and was just nonsense and didn t need to be an entire episode  the mall thing was ellies back story how she got bit and was in the game so i didn t think it was that bad  but it could of been shorter and moved faster.
love you melonie your absolutely gorgeous beyond the universe and multiverse and all existence
knew it gonna go this way
just because the characters are gay
cuz there s gay characters
@julian davis  no  for attacking people with the whole don t like it don t watch it garbage.
@darksidecaster  what s wrong with that response
@julian davis  it s a defensive response the woke community has to reply for any and all criticism for certain products. for example  taking a criticism over two gay characters when the actual criticism is the fact the show overall is not good.
@darksidecaster  i see. what makes the show not good to you
@darksidecaster guess you never played the game
@etienne boivin  no it wouldn t. contracts put limits on what people can say all the time. what do you think an nda is
i played the game. it is not about the action or even the zombies. it is called the last of us because it is about us   humans and how we interact and bond.
@el mehdi ben hadj  i play the games too and they are action  adventure and horror games also  but i perfectly understand what you are saying.
@hern n godoy ya ez  yeah but this game in particular was really more cinematic than gameplay.
@el mehdi ben hadj  respectfully disagree  the time playing the game is more gameplay than cinematic  most cinematic are just when a chapter end or in the beginning it s depends  the linear base game is what people think is more cinematic but are section with gameplay that feel part of the story and that is also my point to want more action in the live action.
she doesn t care cause she got paid she s not a main character so no one will remember her. as long as padro pascal and the actor for ellie don t talk bad the show will do fine  shields and defenders unneeded .
disagree
@blackdragoonv7  - disagree. any actor that says that about their own show they are in  most people will not watch it.
@cain abel  very true but it doesn t matter to her now if riley was a permanent character like there whole story from the dlc was a season or even a half season as a flashback then her comments would do major damage. but that doesn t seem to be the case and seems more like their agenda over story which shouldn t be a issue cause the game had a strong story without the need for filler
@blackdragoonv7  hasn t pascal already laughed and mocked fans who didn t like the show. he s has a limited acting range  and is lucky to have a career at all. i love watching him get killed in game of thrones now
@paul woodford  news to me i know he s kind of social justice warriors and has said things in the past but currently. i also thought from the first 2 episode he was able to do joel well if there are any critique it s there narrative decisions.
oh but that is not at all what storm said  if you re a homophobe then why watch a show where the main character is a lesbian.
@paul woodford  yea he s kind of a jerk to people who disagree with him!
actually it works every time. just wait until you see the ratings it won t drop the ratings below the average ratings it has been getting.
which lesson  they said exactly that with house of the dragon  the sandman  white lotus  severance  the boys... all hits. boycotting disney  didn t stop it from winning the streaming wars  just like boycotting hogwarts game will never work. the lesson here  if you re a homophobe leaving reviews calling gays  degenerate   and  deviant   then yeah fk off... i proudly say it.
actor has already been paid  the series continues to see increased viewership with every episode. the people making the show have no reason to care about what a bunch of bigots cry about.
the show is doing really well. it s hbo  2 show behind hotd. it s an amazing show based on an amazing game. you guys just sound ridiculous complaining about being shocked that gay people exist in real life.
haha  same here.
yeah  this last episode is where i check out.i was hoping for a decent survivor apocalypse story but am getting a tedious gay soap opera. no thanks.
@sneakyrodent  everything out of hollywood lately is a  tedious gay soap opera
@sneakyrodent  right ! tedious  is the correct description
@dean firnatine  everything  that s not true at all. if you really think that  then you must be searching for it specifically  because what you re saying is hyperbolic bs.
anonymous cheese where did he ever say that  you people believe anything you see on the internet lmfao
suuuuure you re not gonna watch it lol
cool bye  your loss.
no one cares lil bro
@anonymouscheese2095youve heard mixed things from bigots. get it right.
@sneakyrodent well i d rather you get offended than us the actual fans of the game who knew ellie was gay even before they started shooting the damn thing
@sneakyrodent  oh sweetie i know
i wouldn t say riley meant nothing. she was the reason ellie got bit and she taught her not to give up. hence why she didn t leave and give up on joel
henry was the black guy in ep5.you meant frank
god bless you sister melonie  preach
by the end of this episode i was like at this point it feels like an apocalypse didn t even happen in this world.
with great wokeness...comes great brokeness
pop culture crisis is forcing themselves to review this show. one of the hosts  mary  is deeply christian and hyper critical of the show and it s messaging. they actually mentioned you a couple weeks ago when the quartering put your situation on blast. they said they would love to have you as a guest. reach out to mary if you re interested.
never had any interest in the show  tbh. but i have to say again how much i appreciate you sharing your faith in your videos when the you feel moved. it s because of you that i got my faith back. read my bible all the way through last year and working on it again this year. i m a month ahead of pace for finishing by the end of the year. edit  you got me back into the gym  too. i can t thank you enough for that. you literally changed my life.
this episode was the dlc from the game
was an important flashback episode  not a filler
oh no this is so surprising who couldve guessed!
oh i never wanted to watch this anyway even though i could download it   i don t want to
when she says  don t like it    don t watch it!  all i can say is  as you wish!  great video today. you look fantastic!
i felt like the episode was a very faithful adaptation to the dlc  provided the context to her character and how she got bit.
my pfp is actually me a black guy playing last of us obv i loved joel. but playing as ellie was so fun because she has been watching n learning from since she was introduced and then we finally get to play her and it was harder but more fun because u couldn t punch ur way out of it. i loved ellie. and then part 2 came out. then this show. i have chosen to narrow my view that the ellie from part 1 is the only ellie and she is in a coma as of the end of the game pt 1
loved the hobbit love scene
thats exactly whats going to happen to the show.
don t watch it. dont worry  i haven t. and i won t start. works for me!
it s amusing that they re talking about representation while giving us mediocre live action performances of our favourite video game characters. lol
the actress has a point. these people live off of throwing their beliefs in everyone s face. when we hate-watch they get paid. when we talk about them they get coverage. better to not acknowledge them beyond observing what they make as something to avoid. let them fade away into obscurity.
if you dont like it  dont watch it oh the famous last words
episode 3 was a good episode  then 2 duds. last weeks episode was good. so the show is getting back on track.
they could have just told these storys with in all the other episodes
except the show is doing amazingly well  so your talking out your butt lol
in this case  tlou is unfortunately a success
@nick scarlato  part one for the game was doing well too until.....now who s talking out of their butt
@safer ren
@grimm  you are apparently.the series has been crushing it despite your tears
the show us still crushing it dingus lol.
dude i ve been so depressed and anxious the only thing that takes my mind off things is reading the bible.  it shows that all the crap we have been going through is nothing new but that christ god is always there for us and things work out for those who stay on the path.  cheers and god bless.
@was  god bless you  my man!!
@was my anxiety isn t decreasing with much at all.well it depends.but people preaching about end times isn t that comforting as people like to think.not to mention end times mixed with doubts of salvation to what is and what isn t correct.
it is not even about faith. it is about being a decent normal human being  which is totally lacking in california
@steven sun  being a decent human being has been lacking in christianity for thousands of years.
@chandller burse  i hear you. some days are harder than others. i cling to what christ said that no one knows the end times and that a lot of bad things have to come to pass before resolution.
you re so brave and stunning!
play left behind dlc    same thing happens.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  npc brain short circuiting  she was talking to melonie.
ikr so why are ppl complaining. its not like 3rd episode. its faithful to the dlc
guess you never played the game
ok
nah  we can just mock them and not watch their stuff. then they lose a good amount of money and they are just mocked in a bad light. bad publicity is not really good for people. look at people  that have gotten that kind of publicity and you would know they are not doing well.
i do not think that was her point but yes hate watching something is the dumbest thing ever
sail the high seas my dudes!!!
yeah because this show is so obscure right  also you do know that storm was directing only people who are homophobic
good point.
it s wild how 5  of the population dominates entertainment while 95  of the population is becoming frustrated.
why would you hate seeing gay characters in movies or tv
agreed
i would agree. but i wish they would be upfront about it. this is like the third series in a row where they start out good and normal get you interested then start throwing in all the agenda shit in the third and fourth episodes. completely letting me down and wasting my time. just tell us up front it s a gay show. i don t care. but quit trying to sneak it up on me. am not homophobic. but that lifestyle is not my thing and literally makes me nauseous to watch men behave that way. they can do it. i don t care.but i do not want to be tricked into seeing it.
@tom h  bcs its gay !
there is a lot of this that could be solved by just not feeding the trolls. thing is  regardless what is said  people like drama and controversy.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  homophobia isn t real. no one is afraid of gays. we simply disagree with the lifestyle and are tired of the agenda being thrown in out face. try harder.
@boss ross  this was a plot adapted from the game  so this  agenda  has been a thing for about 9 years now.
@boss ross  interesting  so you describe what homofobia is while saying is not it  also what about the old movie  agendas  and pro usa christian propaganda  never saw anyone talking shit then  hmmm  i think is not about respect then  hmmm
@cain abel  also piracy  is my best friend
@tom h  where has anyone actually ever said that  it s the fact it s shoved down our throat way more these days to the point it s infected children s programing and that s what we really have a problem with overall
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   eh
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   lol uses the term infecting for showing something that s normal and proclaims is not rooted in homophobia
@boss ross  phobia is an irrational fear and dislike of something  to act like  it does not exist is certainly something lol.
@boss ross  its not the fear of gays its hatred and discrimination of them.
schools have been doing it for ages yet when i was in school my teacher got fired cause her personal life was none of my fuckin business i was there to learn
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   what does a teacher personal life has to do with teaching about the existence of different types of people  and speaking of personal stuff  why is religion allowed in schools when its not  science  based
reminds me of the south park episode where stan kyle kenny pretend they can t see cartman  and cartman thought he was dead lol
wait  so are you mad for every man and woman that kiss on televisions  because that would be throwing their beliefs in everyone s faces  right
even beavis and butt-head know there r only 2 genders for the love of god
@sirirond  yes learning about other people and cultures is ok in schools but not forcing someones mental illness on other people s kids
@sega nerd 1991  justin lingle   i agree  so religion should be banned then  we both agree here  have a great weekend and keep on being a cool snow flake
yes yes.... they re as an issue with every studio and platform  but not you. this youtuber just read an article from that site saying gays are  disordered lifestyles and acts of grave depravity   and in the next sentence she denies there s any homophobia... dumbest thing i ve heard in a while .
@aisha alamoudi  at least she s a real woman and is still in reality and recognizes the fact there r only 2 genders
@aisha alamoudi  preach!!!!!
@sirirond  why are you promoting hatred   violence towards billions of innocent people  why do you lack basic human compassion for billions of innocent human beings  you should be ashamed of yourself promoting hatred   violence against 90  of all living human beings
but y all can t help yourselves and keep talking about them and about not watching the show lmao
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  yeah but the show sucks even without the gay stuff because the game has that and it worked why i wonder
@boss ross  firmly agree i couldn t of said it better!
@aisha alamoudi  you nailed it  no pun intended
@cain abel  well your mocking isn t working because the show is still very successful
@mister pinkman  house of the dragon ratings from episode 1 -  10.episode 1   2.17 millionepisode 10   1.85 millionthe last of us ratiings from episode 1 - 8.episode 1   0.588 millionepisode 7   1.083 millionepisode 8 - 8.3 millionsomehow i don t think it went up that high for one episode. i am getting a feeling they are fudging the number a lot in the last episode. i guess we will see if episode 9 will have that  higher or a little lower. if they lose most of that  than that will be proof to me that they fudged the numbers to make it look good.
@cain abel  what do you mean ratings  who the hell cares about that  if we re taking viewer counts  each episode of tlou has slowly increased besides episode 5 because of the super bowl that weekend. the show debuted with 4.7 million viewers on opening night alone. and that number progressively got bigger. the show is a massive success. if it wasn t  it wouldn t have gotten renewed for a second season so fast.
@mister pinkman  - what did you think i posted. i posted the viewing ratings. meaning how many views it had. apparently you did not pay attention. also  i am betting view ratings will go down.
@cain abel   well those numbers are wrong then. you re saying episode 1 had half a million viewers which is waaaay off.
.... of a show thats absolutely crushing it
how so  the show is a huge hit dingus lol.
stop commenting on episodes or shows you haven t seen. it s not that hard.
friendly bet joel gets the 9 iron by the end of the first season.
love the first game. then the game part 2 came out. saw the writing on the wall for the show. had a feeling they d ruin it. from what i ve heard  i made the right call by not watching it.
didn t the show runner say that they had to trick the audience to watch episodes
hello melanie  i recently found and subscribed to your channel  and i just want to say thank you for being a real and honest voice for christian nerd culture  and nerd culture at large .keep being awesome  and god bless you
notice how the actress hasn t shown any examples of this supposed  backlash
that phrase won t back to bite you  will it
the episode that wanted to be like the dlc for the last of us 1 that made the hero a lesbian ... a dlc so controversial that amy hennig quit the studio ... reddit has the whole story   there was even a book from a kotaku journalist covering this ... how this affected uncharted 4 that was to be a dark   grim game that was 90  done ... when drake and all his characters die by his brothers hand   and it starts with the cut head of chloe frazer handed to the main hero in a box ... there where trailers   concept art   script  story ... but a egocentric neil druckmann took her whole team when he made the dlc   when amy hennig was nearly done with her uncharted 4 game ... to sabotage her game ... the end result   she quit the studio at the spot ... and neil druckmann stole her character she made for last of us   and took her game uncharted 4 and rewrote it ...  what happened later you can see ... how amy in the industry was ... manhandled
as a kid i recall hearing commercials like  on a very special episode of different strokes.   nowadays it s more like  on another especially gay episode of
i will be taking that great advice from now on.
like   nicely done   melanie just by you explaining sin  it shows you re a bible reader
girl. it s in the game. i ll give you this l.
i already passed. i don t know why you guys watched it. i m not psychic  but i knew what was coming.
this latest episode didn t feel at all like a filler episode to me. it was about an old friend she had  and them sneaking to the mall. it helped her with joel at the end  so it worked pretty well. episode 3 was a different thing  and wasn t for me. i m not going to overreact to it though. just watch the beginning and end of episode 3. actually  i also wasn t a big fan of episode 1 for some reason  it didn t really grab me.the show has continued to get much better since then. as for people hating on religion  it s just selfish entitlement  because they think they should be able to do whatever they want. it s a rebellion  even if they won t admit it. everyone needs limits  or we d have constant chaos. even if u don t believe  your government rules over you anyway  so your choice i guess.
i do think the bill episode was kinda filler and unnecessary  but ellie s backstory i think was good to include  even if it doesn t really move the actual plot forward
she is right. there is so much in the world  for caring and wasting time in a dumb show
i read the bible start to finish in 2021. it really does change your life and perspective. i need to get back into it lol! but it definitely made me confident in the lord and in my faith. i m better able to stand up and defend for what i believe is biblically sound.
this episode is actually based onthe last of us american dreams comic and the last of us left behind dlc.
imagine just hating on something because some 2k year old book with nnk real meaning tells you so. cringe
my question is  if it s a 9 episode season  why have any filler episodes at all
you know it! they are rushing to the joel-in-one scene asap
@patrick henry  they re only 2 episodes left. next episode is when ellie gets taken by david and joel has to save her. episode 9 is obviously wheb they make it to the hospital and joel saves ellie from the surgary and lies to her.
@weapons of warfare  they ll be sure to butcher that part as well.
@weapons of warfare  this show seems shorter than the game.
aye  shes truly a breath of fresh air.i kind of miss the bible verses she would read at the end of her videos . she stopped doing that a few months ago  i suppose she didn t want to put people off   but i liked it  it was different and nice.
word life!!! lol i haven t said word in a cool way since the 2000 era lol well i just dated myself  p
@grindel ston  thats specifically what made me a fan of hers.
its definitely nice to see. i myself have been shifting away from pandering to others and allowing myself and show be representation of who i am. im glad i found her channel as well. and hope mine get be even half as successful
@the merc with the mouth  wow  thank you for your thoughtful comment.
@bridging the geekdoms podcast
dead on arrival
i enjoyed the left behind dlc but the whole ellie and riley kiss thing made me uncomfortable then and is still uncomfortable now. and before people pop off saying i m homophobic it s because the characters are literally children. it s weird that they feel the need to explore a child s sexuality relationships in anything really. remember that one disney film with the fish people and people got upset because the two young boy characters weren t gay for eachother  yeah. bunch of creeps
all roads lead to the joel-in-one with the ghey golf club gang.
@patrick henry  yeah  man. i didn t bother with part 2. i actually made a facebook post about  last of us  last night. to summarize  i said go put the first game on easy  and experience the actual story. my review tho is dont do any of this  go buy the bioshock collection instead if you want a horror series with a good story.
cuz we knew it was coming cuz we actually played the game
hatred will not get you into heaven
this is a criticism valid for episode 3  episode 7 is dlc for the game and is definitely not filler or irrelevant.
don t like it  don t watch it. me  ok
as a pastor i love your videos. maybe we ll get a chance to chat about the faith someday
if anything is  filler  it s this video
they ve already been paid so they actually could not care less if the show flops or is a success. it s easy to sound virtuous when the money is already in the bank.
this episode wasn t about representation really. any actor that says it was is probably pushing their own ideals. ellie is a lesbian. canonically. i dislike pandering to an audience in media but this episode is basically like the dlc of the game. she had a crush on the girl but tragedy happened and she came out alive and her friend didn t. this just gave a closer look at ellie emotionally. so i m not bothered by it cause it wasn t forced. but the  don t like it don t watch it  statement is such a killer of media.
it s actually not a bad episode and provides some valuable character development for ellie  unlike the other gay episode. it was suspenseful and had some poignant  tender moments. i knew ellie was gay in the game and the show was going to keep that aspect of her character in tact. but you know  whatever. i m used to it now.also  fyi   fr.  stands for  father . that is the formal title used for catholic priests  even though the bible explicitly says that no one but god should be called that.
16 00 as a fellow christian  i agree with you 100
this was part of the dlc which was pretty cool and is better after the game.
remember the last person to say that caused a whole ass company to fail  guess last of us about to get the same treatment lol
the only thing i m phobic of is bad television shows.   this show had a great start but the last three episodes have been absolutely awful.
melonie  do you think you would be able to make a video discussing the peter pan trailer that was released  i would love to know your thoughts and what all the fuzz is about.love your content. thank you!
i enjoy the preaching
don t like it don t watch it... challenge accepted.
there are so many other things to worry about in the world.   when you dont worry about it  ignore it  things get worse  more pronounced  and goto the extreme.
how can someone who didn t watch the show commenting on the quality of the show
it s so obvious that you people were never fans of the last of us gamedo these people actually think that developing characters is filler
great video with a ton of good points!!
like the guy who did the lead voice in hogwarts legacy.
@adam  or like the original harry potter  perhaps
@vince garcia  yeah
g4 references are always the best
if you dont like gay or trans people dont watch the show or get use to them being around if you are gonna watch it. left behind wasn t filler. it shows the lost ellie was talking about before and the reason she chose not to leave joel behind. riley taught her to not give up any time you have with the people you love. with her and riley that was a romantic love and with joel and ellie is a familial love.
the only thing i m phobic of is being patronized and gaslit...
the fuss is about tinker bell being black.  robin williams can play a old 30 year old peter pan but  tinker bell being played by a young black girl is too much.  and you dont need to watch melonie to know her thoughts on it.  a person of color in anything you can guess what she going to say by now lol...
@mike carson  she s a grown ass woman and she s going to sob over tink being black
@dakoata  it is not about fear  it is about seeing the unbalance in everything.  i don t see ru paul doing drag shows for kids. he s got a good thing going for over 15 years. even after s1 filter. gay people are not scary.  if you listen closely it is the media. be very skeptical about the questions they ask. they are not there to inform  the main purpose is to manipulate through the guise of information.
@dilanger  whats unbalanced
@dilanger  as soon as ep 3 came out so many people were made that it was about a gay couple even ben shapiro hoped on that train
@dilanger  and what are they manipulating me to do what s there goal to  manipulate me  about gay people
@dakoata  what is unbalanced is the reactions to what the media bates us to do  manipulation  we fall for it every time. the question from the media is not organic  it was rehearsed so it can generate this kind of reaction.  really  3 separate replies  is evidence for damaged calm.  we cannot listen to other people s opinions  telling us what to think  what to feel   and how to act.  we have to stop taking media tv shows and telling others it is not for  them.  we have ignored this problem and it is getting worse...more and more separation   more and more anger and fear.  every time you hear it  read it  watch it   there is something  underneath going on. nothing is innocent   it is all planned and connected. when you realize that  everything and i mean everything is just water off a ducks back.
bruh seriously
man  i m so far ahead of her.loved the gamethat left behind dlc was... never played 2
preach   your absolutely right.
okay but wait hear me out.. this is literally in the game tho..
the great majority do not care what others do in their lives. live however you want. but when you constantly slam it down the throats of the population and tell others how they re supposed to feel it gets old real quick.
you saying there was filler episodes is an absolutely crazy thing to say when one of the first things you said is you only watched the first episode and then made your decision that it was overrated   maybe if you put your brain power to work and watched the rest of the episodes you might understand the story
i agree with you
im giving this show a shot  even though there is no where near enough action. im concerned about the actress playing ellie and her ability to pull off flashback scenes in a season 2  in specific the museum scene with her and joel which is filler but also one of the strongest parts of the second game. all im seeing is a weaker version of the product  even in regards to the story telling and pacing  how does a shorter series feel like it has more filler than a long ass game...
i m just laughing at all the people that said when it started ooh wow this is a great show. what an amazing job they ve done etc. you have learnt nothing!
i really enjoy the four they just ran makes remember what it was like being in england
had an awkward family gathering and everyone s favorite brother in law told me proudly that he was enjoying rings of power  the halo show  velma and the last of us on hbo. i just nodded my head and slowly backed away lol.
lmao if people are upset about this just wait till next season.
i find bible lectures relaxing to listen to
does this invoke the  your terms are acceptable  meme
has no one played the game  i mean this is in the game... released around 2015 on the last of us remastered. the game included this  called left behind. the kiss was in the game. everyone knew ellie was gay.
we re on what episode 7 now and we ve seen like i don t know  maybe a total of 30 minutes total of actual infected zombies. that s a strong maybe.
these modern writers don t seem to understand that we normal humans can relate to others experiences  struggle  pain  and overcoming obstacles. it is called empathy  it doesn t matter if the character is a trash compactor robot from the future  pizza earing turtles  fantasy frodo  space wizard with laser swords  or lego people! it is the story and their journey  it has nothing to do with what they look like
these ppl being so unaware of how terrible and cringy they are never ceases to amaze me
thank you for telling it like it is with the thumbnail!!!
melanie. right on sister!
what about episode 3
@   mae     bill is hay they just expanded his character more in episode 3
you people just watch a gay couple on your tv and throw a tantrum even though in the original she was lesbian
you people really love that phrase   shoved down our throats   is there a secret ya ll aren t talking about
@julian left  melonie doesn t agree with my views  so she s a bad person. i m totally holier than she is. if she would just agree with me  she would be cool again   julianleft4662
@julian left  wait really  i had no idea about her until recently  i figured she d always been like this. her twitter posts are unhinged and obsessed. it s really odd.
this is a great show  pity you feel that way.
that s someone i d avoid.
just one of them is bad enough  but holy shit. it s like that homer simpson bushes gif lol  get out immediately
sure  because that sounds like a real person that exists....and then everybody clapped!
you re literally lying lmao no one likes velma
only so much you can fit in 9 episodes. in the game you re actually walking them through everything and coming across infected. in the show  can t do that unless you want a 20 episode season
@weapons of warfare  yeah i beat the game a couple times. it s obviously just to save money on makeup and costumes  but you re telling me they can waste two full episodes on flashback romances but they can t have more scenes of zombies in an infected apocalypse story... don t make excuses for them
i had a woke coworker who after the first episode said it was amazing and one of the best new shows to come out and literally talked it up all day. i chose then not to watch it and glad i didn t. it s really come to the point where i am fine waiting a half season or so to wait and hear if something is actually good or not. same with movies. i will wait a month before i go see something after there s been enough reviews from people i trust.
thank you for your candor  its still amazes me when you talk so freely   unabashedly about your faith especially in this climate of  cancel woke culture   . the bit about reading the bible - i took it person . god bless you
god bless melonie. i agreed with all you said.
i wonder if the superfluous gay episodes have been blocked in certain other markets.
and yah smiles   you see  back in 2012 we coined the phrase awake are woke  we meant we see through the veil  we see the demonic works so stay awake the original meaning before the demon rephrased it   cunning the demon is they walk among you
great show.
ellie was a lesbian in the first game too so at least this time it s sorta faithful
kinda yeah i get it on what hbo and neil druckmann is trying to do but this hole section was an entire dlc in the game and it s pretty spot on from what went down in the game.
this episode wasn t filler  it s literally the left behind dlc.
swimmingly  amazing.
theres a growing number of gamers that wont touch any new tv shows or movies made after 2020s b c they know their beloved franchise is about to be lobotomized by the rainbow mafia. and if it does have crazy success like the witcher had with henry cavil  actual comic geek and not a woke ideologue   they will replace kick the person for someone willing to be a cheerleader.
i saw all these comments supporting her then i hit newest on the filter and i m glad everyone is shitting on her
imagine how aggressive they ll be with it in part 2 with john cena  excuse me abby. i haven t watched either lol

self-righteous  nameless  child   don t like it  don t watch it literate people with standards   there s a reason that i don t know your name  sweetheart...
workers at naughty dog during development of tlou2 were threatened with the same ultimatum.  if you dont like it you can leave . its manifested into bullying now. if you dont like what we stuff down your throat  then you dont have to eat it. you have to make it make sense. if it doesnt work for the story dont put it in there. the perfect example of a well written gay character is captain flint in  black sails  i highly suggest you guys watch that show if you havent. his character is driven by love  not fantasy.
the problem is the dlc was praised for being  the first gay kiss  in a video game tlou 2 story ran with this to be eligible for all the awards. i was about to watch the first episode and then i realised why would i watch this if the story goes to hell after the first game.
it was all in the game universe.
i agree with her in fact  i stopped at about 20 minutes in episode 3  and won t miss the following. i just watch first season of tulsa king  couldn t believe hollywood could still produce good entertainment. so thanks stallone  and kostner for yellowstone.
don t like don t watch  but anyone who doesn t watch will be called everything under the sun. did i get that right
it s always nice to see people unashamed to take biblical truths seriously.
as a christian you re not even suppose to hate gays you re just not suppose to support it but you still should love and respect everyone.
she had nobody her parents they was already dead all she had was joel and then later dana but they was cool and then was shocked in part 2 even though joel died dana was pregnant. that s when they got the whole six kiss in front of everybody over with when they was alone after that they did  kill a couple of infected people and some creatures they took that goddamn kiss 6 a straight up 10 after smoking some weed they just took care of the kid
gross
@truth crime  what going to be more gross the kiss you just saw or the up-and-coming piece of s    that they got waiting for us something you all hate and involves abby and that guy .neil you forward it and they f     hate it when i saw that my cousin showed me that i was like what the hell they don t even do this in grand theft auto that s what you should be more worried about
i counted 1.5 episodes left and wondered how they gonna fill up 3 episodes  before that one aired . then they hit me with the o   dlc . they been doing good by distilling the core of the scenes and then representing them on screen. not sure why everyone is upset about this. i thought they d be more upset with bill s scene but even that one was a well crafted change. not that it was  better   but they at least hit the core purpose of bill s existence in the game.
@blaze armoru  it s because honestly the anti-woke people are just as bad as the woke people. this episode is literally the dlc and if you played the game knows this moment had an huge effect on ellie. it s crazy that people is upset about the episode. if you played both games then you know ellie the main character is a lesbian it s just what it is. i swear if that episode pissed them off i can t wait until they see season 2
right  i literally never even heard of bella ramsey or storm reid before this show.
@daunt  who
@erik isaksen  exactly
idk if i would call  don t like it don t watch it  self righteous. that s just a reasonable statement. don t hate-watch things you don t enjoy. that s why crap like velma is getting a second season.
well i knew bella ramsey from game of thrones.
@jurassic park  1 fan  game of thrones and hilda
@daunt  man quit playing . you knew that funny  looking wierd chin girl stabbed that giant white walker in the eye in season 8
the show is a hit  like many other shows and films you labelled woke. you re being left behind.
@aisha alamoudi   show is a hit. like a golf hit  -you label woke- define bastardize  and then explain how whichever show movie you say that i labeled woke... is not literally bastardizing the original.  -being left behind where is it  that you believe that you re going and  considering the hysterical lack of original thought in 99  of  woke  media... explain how that place is different - and better - than  here .
it was in the video game that the show is literally based on. its been in the video game for nearly 10 years  get over yourself.
@neve durrant  everybody knows that.everybody knew it then  everybody still knows it now... which is why this is an obvious non-troversy.the dlc was used  in part  as evidence of this  in the freaking video... here s your participation trophy  captain high horse
people know who they are dude. the fact that you dont know isnt really their problem
@volkan kaman  you knowing who she is  from a 400 hour soft-core adult film  with an ending so ill-conceived  that the whole world heard about it  doesn t make her relevant  professionally competent - or well-meaning.btw - it s telling  that you need to pretend that a  star  being nameless isn t a problem... or that i upvoted myself hundreds of times.wow...
@iro  wtf are you talking about  that entire second paragraph doesn t seem to follow anything i said  or even make sense
@volkan kaman  ... your first point was that people know who she is... i pointed out all the people agreeing with me.your second point was that me not knowing her name is a non issue... despite her literal quest for fame - and it being way more than just me.wtf was the mystery.
@iro  the mystery is the incoherent argument you are trying to make.there seems to be more people in support of the show and the actors than the irrelevant people crying about the gays
@volkan kaman   the mystery is you don t get to just pretend that the argument is incoherent...act like an adult and explain yourself.at this point i m honestly wondering if there is a translator issue  or if you re actually literate.  there seems to be more people in support again  these companies have demonstrably lied about reviews  and reviewers.quit. lying. crying about the gays again... again. because you need tutoring on the conversation that you re attempting to be a part of - omfg nobody is doing that.for reasons explained in the video.again.pay. attention.
@daunt  bella ramsey was in game of thrones and storm reid was in euphoria. those two shows are two of the most-watched and talked about shows of all time  which are also on hbo  a very popular and acclaimed network  like the last of us show is.  you clearly don t keep up with popular shows  and that s fine  but you don t need to use your lack of knowledge of modern television in your attempts to bash them and try to invalidate their very valid points.
@iro  if being in two of the most popular hbo shows ever doesn t make someone relevant  then what does  and why does someone need to be  relevant  for you to consider listening to their opinion
@aisha alamoudi   oh i forgot this is your mo it s cute that i ve become your muse  but this isn t the appropriate place to express your fantasies - child.
@volkan kaman  demanding that you behave like an adult  and explain yourself  is not unhinged. you re forfeiting your stance. deal with that.
@iro  you re looking pretty bad right now. stop debasing yourself. be better.
storm reid from euphoriabella ramsey from game of thrones and hilda
@iro  just because you don t know someone s name doesn t mean they don t get an opinion and can t defend themselves i mean i don t know your name either and neither the replies but you can still voice what you think
@lill.27  she s not defending herself  though... again  where are the videos saying that the star wars kissed ruined the show i ve been asking for 1 example of that  for over a week now... and despite all of you saying that it s this huge controversy - 0 examples. everyone knew that characters were gay  etc - back in the dlc... as was explained in this video. there was nobody left to be surprised outraged by that  except for people who knew literally nothing about the games. and anybody who would get offended by  a star wars kiss probably doesn t sub to freaking hbo  bill maher  etc  anyway.
@iro  she is defending herself it was a response for people attacking the show and the actresses for the kiss she was responding to homophobesalso there s plenty of examples  check how low episode 3 and 7 are rated compared to other episodes and episode 3 has twice the amount of reviews than any other episode which means it was review bombed by people who didn t even watch the show and don t tell me they just didn t like it because it doesn t make sense that many people randomly watched episode 3 only and ditched all the other episodesthis woman literally admits she never watched the show or played the game and these are the type of people who would be outraged by the kiss  people who just heard something was gay and jumped to hate not people who played the game and watched the show knowing it s an adaptation and knew what they were expecting
think i ll check out your discord. thank you for all you do. more i watch you the more i feel inspired to go deeper with my faith in christ. sometimes it s hard to watch you because it s so convicting  but that s part of the reason ni know what you re saying is legit lol .
it suits the game
smiles  that s preach all you want . make your videos  long we all love it and need  keep up the good work.
happy to oblige. haven t watched since episode 3. wish i can get a refund of the value of my time since episode 1.
this is what makes you better than the others you run with. i told the geeks and the nerd when they reviewed the 1st episode.  you re like a bad 90s wrestler on a saturday morning match. you never see the agenda-driven chair coming until it bashes you over the head.  you saw the chair coming and blocked the shot from the beginning. thank you for having a moral compass based on biblical teachings.
psalm 59. keep up the great work melonie!
imagine calling that episode filler xd what an absolute clown
6k to make the pc i want from meta pc.... daaamn  how much was yours
i was ok with the dlc episode since it s lifted from the game . the bill epsiode took a great part from the game and just shat all over it
i ve been watching the last of us but what threw me off was the bill ep because it didn t feel right like it didn t belong so i ve just went away from it. i still watch it just for the girl and joe
don t like it  don t watch it! your terms are acceptable.
filler   it s legit fan service for the people that played the game  a good way to expand the game story so i don t see any filler episodes.....it s story....
its weird they say if you don t like it don t watch... then turn around and get mad if people don t watch. i hate filler episodes in short season shows. even the stuff based off dlc.
when tolerance isn t good enough. forced acceptance is the rule of the day
so they chose to go the g4 route  interesting lol
they literally kissed in the video game bro
i mean  it s not like they re changing characters who weren t gay in the games to be gay on the show. all of these characters were already gay and this exact storyline played out the same way in the game. did you think they were gonna change ellie and bill to be straight
i like the christian perspective that you re bringing to this
i don t consider episodes  3 and 7  fillers because they complement the story at certain points. i used to watch anime  for example naruto and it has a lot of fillers. i consider fillers episodes that add nothing to the story.
gay filler .
what s sad is that people still fall for it every time. today s hollywood is going to kill every franchise you ve ever enjoyed  almost without exception. none of it is worth checking out
@dave kolan  indeed!
@gooddoggo  it s sad you have such a view of people who think differently than you do. i wish you well with curing your boredom  -
@peglegcraig  well you and me both then because your not even asking about how i think or about my point of view. thanks  hopefully i do cure it.
@gooddoggo  i know what you think well enough to know that you think calling someone names is the best way to show your superior thinking to them. that s not a person i can reason with nor i think  would you.if you have a point to make i m happy to listen. what i won t do is get into an ad hominem exchange.
@peglegcraig  that s an unfair assumption. i was simply imitating you
@gooddoggo  what is your point  you ve done nothing but hurl insults and divert if you re seeking to educate me on something i think we can both agree that s not a good way.
left behind dlc has been out for like 10 years  are people that surprised
@i4got872 ytp  you don t have to be surprised to react. melonie wasn t and i was also expecting it.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  really  who s a homophobe
@peglegcraig  a good deal of people commenting here are being homophobic.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  i don t see a lot of those at all. why are you talking to me about that  is the more pertinent question.
@peglegcraig  i just assumed you were a homophobe when you used the word agenda in your initial comment  but i supposed i assumed wrong  so i apologize for that.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  no agenda is what it was... two of my favorite characters of all time are lizabeth salander and omar little. they are both gay or bi and their respective movies tv shows handled it in a balanced fashion. they didn t forget the type of shows they were to drive a point into people s heads faces.this is bad writing and total fluff. it kills the pace of the show too. not liking it for its agenda over the story doesn t make me anything  but someone with a different opinion than yours.
@osleya the champion   i pointed out i have no beef with gay characters. omar little and lizabeth salander were both gay or bi. they were well written and  it wasn t like it was hidden for them it was exploited throughout their movie tv show. so it seems you are more bigoted against christians than i am about lgbtq  people.
then don t watch istg
not true. bill was only hinted at being gay -- no nauseating flash back chapter. ellie s sexuality is only brought up in the dlc -- literally never mentioned once. the game was entirely about joel and ellie  father and daughter.
@north  ellie s sexuality is a pretty huge part of last of us part 2
@red nocturne  this isn t season 2 -- i don t mind creative license  but if people are going to compare this to the original game  i will pull them up on it. yes  when season 2 comes out  i would expect a large portion of the show to be dedicated to ellie and dina.
@north  fair enough i suppose.
i think it s just a waste of time and unnecessary to give a side character and a character we never even met in the game a whole episode. just wasn t needed  it s a story about joel and ellie s relationship  that should be the main focus.
@   mae     on the one hand i understand you  but they are different media. both episodes served to develop the main characters. the 3rd served for joel to care and open up more with ellie. the 7th with what happened to ellie in the past and what riley learned not to give up on the people she loves  and in the end it shows that she didn t give up on joel.
respectfully  i d disagree in the fact that this episode is filler because this new one is actually part of the series  canon.  whereas the story in the nick offerman episode was changed for tv because those two characters hated each other in the game.
everyone has a metapc sponsorship except az  you love to see it
the girl is right. why watch something and just complain. if you don t want to see gay characters in anything then don t watch it s simple.
i didn t play the game so i had no information on what would happen in the show. i somehow knew the 2 girls were going to kiss as the show went on and actually expected it because of how woke entertainment is going. it is getting to the point where it could have played out where they spent their last days together just as friends and it would have been refreshing.
despite the filler episodes  considering it is only 9 episodes and some much to tell  i m enjoyng the show. this series probably will be unwatchable on season two though  specially if they follow that awful story  of the second game...
don t like it  don t watch it  5 min later  no one s watching it!
i don t even have a dog in this one. i m more of a classic gamer  and what i saw of the game was like myst for a modern era. so... shrugs
i dont think she understood the meaning of the episode
fine! i can use that whole hour to do something more enjoyable  like play hogwarts legacy.
i still like the show  i ll still watch the show. and i actually thought these episodes were good. however it does irk me that the 2 episodes that step away from the main storyline are both  gay  episodes. i don t know that i d call it a  filler  episode though  but they certainly could have made it more 50 50  gay  story main story instead of 95 gay 5 main.
i liked the first world building episode quite a bit.  this one was awful and not watching more episodes suddenly became a very real possibility.
smiles could give you a new nickname preacher melonie
i wish the show would devote a couple of episodes to animal husbandry   it s just what a zombie show needs.
this is the best channel. it s rare to see a christian-based critique on modern media.
if you don t like it don t watch it.  apparently these people don t know how money works.
this episode is pretty much straight from the game i ll admit episode 3 was definitely a filler and not needed but this episode fleshes ellie s character out more where bill is just a dead character that has nothing to do with the story at this point
in the game frank was already dead and bill was an angry old man and he d have hilarious banter with ellie  and the recent episode is game accurate with probably a few small changes. changes were obviously to be expected and those who played the game didn t mind the changes. if you didn t play the game than obviously you wouldn t know any of this.
hey she s wearing the same red sweater and the same ponytail from the first stalker update video.
this show is killin  it overall. i know sooooooooo many ppl who aren t gamers who love this show!  dontlikedontwatch very good advice!
i only played a few hours of the first game.  just wasn t for me  but it didn t seem like a gay romcom at all.  did this happen in the actual game later   i thought it was about shooting zombies.
this is in the games dlc
they kissed in the game
the fans are
i watch last of us and play hogwarts lol
@nick scarlato  no problem with that.
@nick scarlato  and good bro you keep doing that i m watching episode 8 now and imma watch the one this sunday. i m going to order me something that has nothing to do with the bible it s just that you got to pray you survive twisted metal and if not that nightmare creatures what happened to games like that was challenging. there is no such thing as you don t like it don t watch it it was called survive if you can t
the people that are starring in one of the most watched shows on hbo  yeah.
@ghost  that ain t saying much. watch those numbers drop just like they did for the game with part 2.
@patrick henry  the last of us part two. is that the game that sold 14 million copies
it s just an absurd comment for anybody involved with a tv show to say.
@rabbit1124  when you make art or any creative entertainment  you expect a certain amount of people to not like whatever the hell you re doing. not everybody is going to like it. doesn t mean you need to pander to the people that wouldn t be fans of your show anyway. fans of the actual show and game enjoyed this episode. the people complaining about this episode  people like the girl in this video who say she hasn t really even watched the show anyway
@ghost227  lol and pissed off13.9 million customers.  yeah. that s the one.
@patrick henry  oh shit so 14 million people bought the game and hated it  that s crazy. how did they get to 14 million before people realized it was terrible  people didn t realize it 2 million  3  million  4 million  10 million  interesting. anyway  i m playing the game. i like it a lot.
i am an artist actually. and isn t that common sense  we are talking about a tv show tho  not a painting. it isn t a good thing to piss of ur viewers. that s how u get cancelled. just saying.wasn t tryna start an argument bud.
@rabbit1124  who said this is an argument  and how on earth is making the show faithful to the game that the fans love  pissing on them   all i see are people who don t watch the show complaining about the show and people who are actually fans enjoy it. so   it s almost like the people complaining only complain on the gay episodes because there s money in  get woke go broke  narrative and these commentators have bills to pay
@rabbit1124  can you fill me in on why ben shapiro of all people is doing a simple video on a simple episode featuring gay people and not the rest of the episodes  if this is a genuine critique from someone genuinely watching the show  why aren t they doing videos on all the episodes  oh right.
@ghost227  most pre-ordered it  professor bigbrain.  derp
@ghost227  this show is anything but  faithful to the game  what kind of drugs are you taking
@patrick henry  you re grasping at straws to confirm your bias.
@ghost227 some people here are fans of the actual game and fans of the first game also hated 2.this is another case of one side of the fandom pointing the finger at the other.i can t deal with how repetitive this is in every gaming fandom.i just experienced this with fallout again although i expected it.
@ghost227 there actually is a number of people who bought it hated it and refunded it or threw it away.not sure if its a large number probably not but then theres fact people may just now leave it on their shelf forever.statistics for this game is an odd one with both sides saying this or that.it doesn t really matter.the second s story is polarizing either way.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14 when did he say anything about gay people
@rabbit1124  it is if the viewers are bigots
@patrick henry  u must not of played the game then because this show is doing the game justice
@chandller burse  ben shapiro talked about how it s unrealistic that bill and frank are gay in a zombie apocalypse
@patrick henry  pls explain how the show is dog shit without bringing up gay characters that were gay in the game
@patrick henry  sheep baw baw baw
@dakoata  that makes no sense lol.ben shapiro has terrible takes as far i see his take on the batman was odd one of his very first points was simply that  all the black people are good guys there is like three black characters anyways not a large amount.
@chandller burse  my bad wrong comment i think. i seen u say something like when did he say that and i also seen someone comment about ben shapiro talking about ep 3 i just got the two comments mixed up
@chandller burse  he does have horrible takes tho
@patrick henry  the games selling like hot cakes again right now  so people loved it and are clearly still loving it.
@travis cue  mmmhmm
not in the middle of the original game though -- dlc. it works as a standalone episode  as does bills  but they should not be occupying the same space as main story. audiences need time to grow attached to joel and ellie  it s important for the ending. if this doesn t happen  the ending will fall flatter than the final season of got.
@north  yeah but all that episode did was flesh ellie s character out more and get the audience to understand and know her more as a individual character and we already got joel s flashback
sins are sins because they lead to self-destruction and misery. they are not a list of rules. and look how miserable these people are.
what these people don t seem to realise is that having people criticizing their show is a good thing.take me  for instance  i am not criticizing anything because i haven t watched any of it.
it s literally in the game it s not filler
i thought it was a good episode.
my respect for you melonie for being a christian and talking unashamedly about christ  is simply over the moon!
i liked it  p
it wasn t filler. it was literally straight from the source material
there is a way stories can do these kinds of things  but with the tlou part 2 and now this show  the allegory is so on the nose that it just feels so unauthentic  and patronizing by the creaters. it seems these creators can t handle any criticism and tend to hide from it by calling all of it  homophobic . also  you can just barely not see the creators marionette strings for their real life agendas and i think that s the greatest sin of all in storytelling.
judge an entire season by watching the first episode  your process is blowing my mind lady...
bills episode maybe i can see hopw people would be mad. this one absolutely no riley and ellies story is at teh core of ellie s story she mentions her at the end of the game even before the dlc.  her name was riley and she was the first to die  it s what drives ellie why she wants to be the cure because she couldnt help riley  or tess  or sam. this is 100  peope that did not play the game lol.
omg  this is a dlc in the game. they re adapting the game to tv  they re not cutting this stuff out cause it s part of the game. if they did  fans of the game would ve been pissed off that they cut out characters and storylines from the game. it doesn t matter what fans of the show want  the fans of the games matter.
well this did happened in the game apart wondering if i m correct and then when part 2 came around people was asking about was that kiss really was six.  well after killing a couple of creatures and infected people going through snow with the horses and got to that  alone time smoking the weed it s a f     10 it just cause someone they life. by the way two girls kissing is definitely a turn-on ask anybody
in the game she s gay and in the game bills gay. yal don t know anything about the source material.
as someone who has actually played the game this was the only part of the story from the first game where you see that  this recent episode is canon. whereas the bill and frank episode is not canon  so i agree that that episode shouldn t have been in the show
who is talking about sins  storm was talking about people who dislike the gay characters should stop watching then  i mean ellie is a lesbian and she has a girlfriend in the next game. if you do not like the episodes fine  but i have seen too many complain about them being gay and having this made up gay agenda in the show.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  melonie was talking about sin. i could care less about the show or the actors.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  it s not a made up gay agenda when two of nine episodes on a zombie show are about gay romance. it couldn t be any more obviously an agenda.
@cristela  just because it has gay people
@cristela  u havent played the game to know that bill frank elie and riley are all gay huh
being gay isn t a sin also didn t the bible promote slavery
@dakoata  don t need to play the game to know bill and frank relationship in the game was just a letter and it was a toxic relationship in which frank killed himself to get away from bill. but couldn t have that in the series  no instead we had a hallmark romance for the ages that would have been boring and pointless even if it was a straight couple.
i know some folks on crew of this show and you d me amazed at the shitshow this was to make.  it s 9 episodes because it was once 10  but they had a complete tool of a director on the first 2 episodes  ep1 was supposed to be all the prologue and 2 was going to be afterwards   but they had to edit the first two together and re shoot because the director was fired and they took all of his shots out in order to not give him credit.so it shouldnt be a surprise that 40  of the series is disjointed and disconnected because there is a lack of direction.  everyone else on the crew did a smashing job - lighting  set dec  costumes  makeup  etc.     its just the direction and writing that suffered a bit.
i have a question for melanie mac i wonder if she had a choice to erase all queen from the plant or would not do it and let leave there lives as they want because i have a feeling you would choose erase them and that is not loving at all
i feel like i m the only person who actually doesn t hate watch. i mean  how hard is it to stop giving these people views or clicks or however new media determines engagement. like  you already know that if it s a tv show in this age  it s agenda d and the people making it are only doing it for the easy awards and bucks. the game was already a sad dad zombie movie anyway. i don t get it.
glad to see i ve missed nothing since canceling my hbo max subscription.
made for the modern audience.
also  people will say they are  bi  simply because it s a trendy thing to do. i think a lot of people are lying.
like you got to tell people this shut the f     and play the game please maybe you ll learn something excuse my language. but that s how you got to come at people if not block you got to do that to teach them a lesson at the end of the day it s just business
they think they re really deep and profound  tlou p2 was just  revenge is a vicious circle and everybody losers  me smart
@adam  oh  but revenge for abby is a good thing and it helps her spiritually. they re not as clever of writers as they think they are.
right. she stopped watching the show so why should she care
@jt  she shouldn t  she also shouldn t have an opinion on a show she didn t watch... it would be like watching the first ten minutes of a movie and then saying it s overrated  i don t really take people like that seriously...
@johnny h. rickensien  i 100  agree.
the red flag sentence
made for those who actually played the game and have known this for 10 years
@weapons of warfare  the bill and frank episode isn t a good adaptation of the game though.
sadly  most of them do it to not get bullied by the alphabet mafia.it s pathetic.
@patrick henry  yeah  think it works like that in realt  world and notte your terminal online world
saying you re bi was kind of a fad when i was younger. and  oh surprise  almost all were just talking out of their behind and dated straight without pause.today it s non-binary or trans. social contagion is real and most of them today will cringe hard about themselves in ten years. they can t outrun the reality of them being boringly straight normies forever.
@sub zero  no one cares what you think.
do you actually have any proof of this at all
@patrick henry  do you have any actual proof of this
melanie you got a good grift going. right wing theocrats are an amazingly loyal audience am i right
did you forget this was in the game
content of the episode aside  i m genuinely getting sick of  don t like it  don t watch it  as a cop-out of any criticism.quick edit  i am referring to when they tell us this instead of listening to why we don t like it. then again  they are incapable of being rational. let s honor their request
episode 7 is the best one by far  and i am against   the message  . ep 3 was   look at the gay happy couple   - trash.meanwhile ep 7 gives us a look at ellies life like we never had it. their kiss wasnt forced  felt natural and awkward and innocent. the acting was so real and when they got bitten  the horror of impending doom was just amazing.
l  ratiothis is an l take from an l person who takes an ever harder l on game knowledge  media knowledge and understanding what a filler is.and a final l and formal rip to any braincells that may have once existed in that empty dome of hers.
the episode was not filler and i understand that people are allergic to everything that s woke but don t go completely overboard. you will end up being just as annoying and hysterical. i think they did a beautiful job portraying the left behind dlc without selling the whole gay girl stuff.
all you have to do if you want to see the repercussions for sin in the flesh is look to disney and their failings since they started going the path that they are on. point blank period.
i have many gay friends and i love them but the problem with hollywood is they re trying to play catch-up and make up for what they didn t do in the past and it s making every movie that comes out or whatever have gay shit in it it s overloaded. i would kill for just like a regular action show to come out with no talk about sexuality or anything like that.
i m trying to like this series  i really am. it s just hard to enjoy when each episode is a coin flip whether its going to be pushing the story along or standing in its path saying  now a message from our sponsor . i wouldn t mind so much but its an entire episode and it could have been told in a single scene as a flash back. story momentum is like a roller coaster that can t quite make it up each incline and then zooms down the decline too fast.
using mac as a promo code for a pc is pretty funny.
lol. after they fooled me with that brokeback fungus episode i ran for the hills and managed to dodge this
i agree those 2 episodes was fillers episodes. they really don t have much of anything to do with the main story. i do like some aspects of the show like joel character and the different kinds of clickers.
once you accept jesus sacrifice and give yourself to god. feels like weight lifted off my shoulders. i used to be on the fence. then after having children and getting married. my wife took me to church and just felt right. could feel a connection with god.
i know it s canon to the dlc from the game but dlc or not  i m so sick of the girl-bffs-turned-lovers trope. girls can be friends without being in love with each other like come on people.
ok lol
@sewer rat  yes it is ok.
i would even argue for playing left behind in the middle of last of us  left behind with seeing ellie s backstory does balance out against seeing joel s backstory from the opening chapter of the game   but the problem with the tv show is that it s all over the place structurally. the game is a focused and crafted narrative of joel and ellie s story. it s more of joel s story  but it s pretty heavily ellie s story as well  especially since you get to play from her perspective as well. but it s their story and all about their relationship  everything is told from their point of view  and anything that doesn t serve that story isn t in the game. in the game  joel and ellie encounter bill and he joins their journey for a short time  and then they part ways  but the entire time it s still completely joel and ellie s story and told from their point of view. the problem with episode 3 is that we come to a complete stop and lose all momentum  and we do a flashback for an entire episode of bill and frank  which is completely unrelated to the main story  and completely unrelated to joel and ellie. bill isn t even alive in the tv show  as he was in the game. it s a romance story for the sake of tricking the audience into watching it  in the words of the director  who proudly boasted about that. and the same applies to the left behind episode  episode 7. it s only the backstory portion of left behind  and spends far too much time on it  when it should have interwoven the backstory and present day  as the game did  in order to keep the main story moving forward. and this same problem occurs in other episodes as well  in different ways  but i ve already written an essay  and no one will read this anyway. i must just be homophobic according to the show s actress  it s not possible that i just might have a valid criticism... which is a criticism that any real english professor would have made  back when teachers and journalists and writers were actually talented and intelligent. i mean the show is fine  it s just nowhere near as good as the game was  and it s nowhere near as good as it could have been.
um  this isn t filler. like at all.
i think part of the problem with them creating these shows  and live action movies  is they don t put people who actually care about the projects  and making sure its the actual story.
and this is from material based upon the game that people actually like. i can t wait to see the fallout when the part 2 material starts to kick in.
two fruit bowls in one season.  i m glad i don t have hbo.
challenge accepted lets see how that works out
it actually is valid. stop paying the enemy to spit in your face.
@jello snake  i just mean more of they refuse to have rational conversation because they are irrational. i agree that we shouldn t give them our money
you are indeed the exact person that storm was talking about  wow that is awesome.
there s the homophobe
yeah they do
i always hated the last of us  i hate it the entire directionality of gameplay. only now are people starting to complain about the fact that it s just a movie that you mash x through. which is what it was  i don t see your complaints even being relevant i see you just being whiny
@joe kurr  i actually never played them myself. i was interested them at one point  but never to the level where i have to play them. but idk if i will. my complaint is more about putting people in charger of these stories that know what they are doing because most times they dont.
@nosaj ttimmed  i always wanted to play the first one but the second one put such a bad taste in my mouth that i don t want to touch and last of us media anymore
except that isn t the case here. they ve adapted far better than any book or video game adaptation so far. my only issue so far is that the way they portrayed bill and frank in episode 3 was very problematic.
@austin larrimore  i will keep that in mind  i actually have a channel  where i review old games  and i might retro review that one at some point  let me get you the link.
they usually actively hate the source material
@joe kurr  i don t think anyone is going to lose any sleep over how you see things.
@joe kurr no one hates the game still.the game isn t awful but i never felt as a fan of uncharted and crash and jak. that it deserved the praise it got its literally called the greatest game yet its not all a game the game should at least excel in gameplay more.sure the gameplay isn t bad and its somewhat enjoyable but even the sequel made it funner but the sequel is well the sequel.and then theres that remake that makes me think nd doesn t even remember they had games before last of us.joel and ellies story is the best part but if you removed it the game itself the actual game would not be remembered fondly.
the dlc was filler and it was just a way to change ellie gay for part 2
@patrick henry  what do you mean changed  it isn t even touched on in the main game for the most part. when ellie looks at the magazine of nude males she literally says  i don t see what the big deal is . that s showing she could be gay. nothing was changed.
@yellow jello  it s because of ellen page.
@patrick henry that s your reply  no facts about the game or anything  that s your reply  lmao
@austin larrimore the first is why the second is considered bad though.
@joe kurr  tell me you ve never actually played the game without telling me
that s a really ignorant comment to make because the creator of the video games is also heavily involved with the tv show. so you can t complain that the people working on this show don t care about the source material  when the people who worked on the source material are involved with it.
@osleya the champion  umm sure.
@chandller burse  the gameplay in the last of us is actually good though unlike that dogshit uncharted
@cody11096  uncharted has way more entertaining parkour gameplay.also they are basically the same.tlou also has a really weird stiff feeling anyways.
so you never played the game
gamers will keep the show going
i know people love the game. i played it  it s whatever. gimme resident evil or dead space  gears of war.ok yeah  clickers  and zombie land. rescue the  only girl that can save us with her immunity  and  oh his daughter died so elle is like joel s daughter   snore.
same here i watched the first one and i was already out
imagine complaining about a faithful to canon episode in an adaptation. it was the left behind dlc  pretty much verbatim.shit take central.there s gotta be a way to keep channels out of search results  youtube...
she didn t say if you don t watch it then you re homophobic. she said if you don t like it  don t watch it. which is a perfect philosophy to have when it comes to anything and everything. you re reaching hard for a reason to hate on this one melly mac
i wouldn t call it  filler  but it s definitely wasting valuable time that would be better spent developing ellie and joel s relationship  which is kind of the whole point of tlou  and honestly lacking 8 episodes in now.
wasn t watching it anyway after they did my man joel like that
i mean that s basically what the left behind dlc was. we knew how ellie got her bite and we knew about riley so why d the dlc need to exist  it was a fun dlc but just like this episode  it didn t need to exist. i would ve much rather had a sequel dlc or a dlc about joel and tommy before the games events than the left behind dlc.
i mean they had this exact thing in the game. people act like it was added  by the show runner. game went woke before this show was ever thought of.
ummm. this was the actual dlc for the last of us videogame. this flashback was hinted at for a while in the show. did you hate that the creator added this in for some reason. it seems as if it s homophobia related
i m from the appalachian mountains and that s one of the most underrepresented groups in media  and i m fine with that.
clicks on this bc i like you and the last of us and wanted to see your opinionthis video  causes me to clean my entire room and read my bibleyou  genuinely  rock
wait until you see the peter pan and wendy trailer
fr is the abbreviation for father  which is the title given to priests in the catholic church. it s like rev for reverend in the protestant church.
it s in the game and part of ellie s story. so what s the issue
you literally never played the game  did you
hey melonie  loved this video and hope you do more deep dives on pop culture and biblical interpretation. i loved the first game  i felt it was a great story and fun playthrough. the show looked like it was going to go full woke and i decided to stay away from it. hope you are well and love your content.
16 02 exactly! they are always like  why do you care   while literally forcing this crap onto people and calling for the death of athletes who simply didnt celebrate their sinful lifestyle by wearing a rainbow jersey or taping their hockey stick with rainbow tape. they literally want everyone to care but everytime someone disagrees  its somehow wrong to care all of a sudden. everything has to be about them.
it was an ok episode i mean i m never watching this show again after this season and i ll probably go to confession and i m not even catholic
1 35 this is how i felt about the game.
i also stopped watching half way through the first episode
one can also argue what you re asking for didn t won t need to exist either. not everyone agrees and you only speak for yourself
she is homophobic she literally calls the dlc filler in the video and says it focused more on story than the gameplay which is what the main game also did. she s doing a bad job of hiding it at this point
no one cares
the game is just as  woke  as the show wym
bill was gay in the game ellie is gay in the game
the show already had gays lmao
omg get lost  they ve all been gay in the games and they will continue to be so in the show  istg
i got my fill of lou when lou1 came out a long time ago and played that game to death. when i finally put it down it was bittersweet. today i look back with fond memories. and i leave them as such. memories. no  i m not going to do lou2  and no i m not going to do the tv show. they are all cash grabs. look back to the time lou1 came out and you ll see druckmann even said he had no intention of making a sequel. this was always meant to be a one-off. no long term franchise. lou2 was just a product of druckmann getting greedy as the money from lou started slowly going away after natural decline of sales numbers.
great video and perspective melonie - i am quite impressed!
last of us is massively successful and woke. cope more
i m starting to think these actors and actresses are being isolated and lied to by the studios that hire them. the big names in the game i get  but i find it hard to believe there are this many smaller names that are buying into this false narrative on their own.
it s cool if you don t like the show. i can respect that. i like the show. nice writing and some good acting in my opinion. only things i didn t like was tess kissing the infected and the scene where bill and frank had sex. kinda made me uncomfortable since i am straight but i watched the rest of the episode. and i still like the show
don t have to worry about me  because i haven t ever watched it nor do i intend to!
amen. haters gonna hate what you have to say but everyone faces judgement eventually.
i haven t played the game  but i had heard that in the game ellie is a lesbian. also  in episode three  the couple were gay in the game as well. although i feel episode three was clearly filler  and i don t care to see that much of a love story from anyone. straight or gay  doesn t matter. could have been some steal magnolias ish  and i would have felt the same. the 7th episode though  i didn t feel as if it was filler. and considering it s part of that character s backstory  it didn t bother me. there was a moment when you are introduced to the fact that ellie is a lesbian  for those that don t play the game  but i don t think it was as drawn out  and practically as pointless as it was in episode 3. imo
can t wait to see what they do with abezilla
don t like it  don t watch it! i think they forget who pays their bills.we need food. we need shelter. we don t need them.
the 93  needs to say  enough fr.   father
someone has never played left behind dlc
please tell me you at least experienced nds other series specifically their ps2 to ps3 era.arguably better than tlou to me but thats my view.
@chandller burse  tbh i m not opposed to playing older games but for the most part i missed the boat on many of them. although i have a ps4 now most of my gaming is either xbox or switch  and back in the day i didn t game much at all.
@james morris  you don t have to miss out on uncharted.do not only be a player of the game nd neglects their others for
@chandller burse  it s not purposeful neglect. i have other things going on in my life. i definitely have uncharted on my radar but if you have any other suggestions i d be glad to note them!
@james morris  i meant nd neglects them.
@james morris  ratchet and clank i never played the originals myself the reboot is fun but the story is a butchering of the original play the originals i can tell they are good for the most part supposedly i hear to avoid 4 for all and size matters.also the sly series and infamous from ghost of tsushimas developers.the original god of war series too.
i loved that it was a  he or she just so happens  stance than the  oh and this person is gay and we ll use that as the only thing that matters  forget writing a  good character  their gay that s it  i just want a character that was written well  they did an awesome job doing said just so happens move than what s going on the show
i like to binge watch series. i wait till there are several seasons before i start. if actors or producers ever say anything vs the fans  i ll avoid it all together. i m a customer. if you mistreat other customers  why would i do business with you
to be fair this is the lore of the game. ellie is shown to be gay in the last of us dlc
gay ppl deserve to be represented in media just as much as straight ppl do. if yall call every gay character couple  pandering   not only does it become redundant but its super obvious that ur just using that as an excuse to cover ur homophobia  badly  might i add.  also! this is literally canon material. how tf r u gonna complain abt gay characters couples in tlou of all things when ellie being gay is literally common knowledge
the fr stands for father.
thanks for representing us christians  melanie! we need more content creators like you out here
what s the problem with this episode  it was straight out of the games almost scene for scene. this is about as faithful that the show will get because you know joel is going to get a massive lecture from ellie at the end of episode 9 for taking her chance to be a hero away from her.
my sister s an actor. they are forced to go to classes on all this pc crap. the vast majority don t actually buy any of it but if they want to get work they have to pretend they agree with it
@bill thomas  very interesting... this might be something i look into when i get my channel up and running. i d love to see an alternative created that wouldn t require them to do this.
lol jusgement for crying about a tv show  good joke
.. you know they re crushing it right they really dont need you
i believe they were referring to the homophobes who ve never played the game
she already got paid
she hasn t played the last of us at all
the irony of this statement physically pains me.
she s preaching about sin in this video. homophobes are the ones hating the episode
@weapons of warfare  ahhh guess i ve gotta comb through this video to see her interesting religious argument
i think being concerned about who people love is absurd to me i just dont get it she literally verbatim made the map argument
i m black and i m gonna be real it really pissed me off they race swaped maria
i love christians  they will always keep praying for us sinners
well i wasn t anyway when i heard about the first gay shit that was happening
sooo believing in demons makes sense but being born trans or gay  as compared to choosing  ain t possible. lol
what bro this was literally in the dlc of the game back in 2014 when nobody batted an eye  this episode is crucial backstory to show us why ellie wants to protect joel so much  everyone she cared for died. the hell is this gay filler stuff about and why do people feel like an agenda is being forced into them  it s just world building and giving ellie a motive.  spoiler  i thought it was cool since these kids were born into the post apocalypse and are discovering for the first time what the world left behind before the outbreak. their sense of wonder and amusement was depicted nicely  and so was their bond. like cmon it s just a bond  they were being normal friends
i think the problem with a lot of these shows is not that they have a lesbian  gay or trans character  but they overly-emphasize that fact and put them on a pedestal. they make some aspect of the show about who they are sleeping with rather than continuing the story more and then claim its for  character development ... just because their sexual preference is different does not mean they are better worse than the heterosexual couple! maybe it is like you said  for  woke points   but its a trend that we nerdy normal folk are seeing far too often these days. just tell a good story in your movie show ffs  dont change the colours race sexual orientation for representation and most people - surely a majority - will be happy and watch it! i just hope they havent done the same with mando s3
challenge accepted
the actors have already been paid. they don t care if people don t watch the show or if they piss off fans. they feel that woke points are more important than their work resonating with fans. of course  they never seem to make the connection that the money they were paid came from fans.
what the heck... i just saw a video of you eating a stick of butter... context  haha.
great advice at the end! you always inspire me to be a stronger christian! keep preaching!
it s women like this that make me feel okay with misogyny  the people you agree with are the same people that don t want you to even have an opinion  let alone hear it
way ahead of her. i haven t watched it at all since i knew what it was going to be  but i ve seen a lot of snippets since then. i loved the game  but they can keep the show.
i think you lot don t understand what  filler  means  one of the most important things about ellie s character happened in this episode and you weirdos are like  filler!
during the season of  lent  it s written that god traveled into the forest alone and fasted for 40 days and 40 nights. there are vices in this world that are extremely hard to give up. at 32yrs old  probably why i am not a father. i have my own vices and personal struggles to get through. my personal walk with jesus is a walk in progress. but i know i am on the right side of things.
yeah so- it s better that i didn t get invested in this show in the first place. that s cool. i don t need these heckin  posterior-hats.
there s a difference between putting in subtle romance in a show about zombies  and straight up writing entire episodes as if they were supposed to be in a rom-com.
haven t watched a single second of it. come to think of it  i haven t watched hardly any new movies or shows in years. no way home  terminal list  the boys  invincible. that s literally it.
the only filler episode was the bill episode it could have been cut down at least 20 min but regardless it was a good episode still would have wanted what happened in the game  and episode 7 wasn t filler its literally canon dlc so... i m confused
seriously  what do i have to do to get a look at that brown eye of yours
except this show is doing really well though despite all you guys complaining lol
but the game had lesbians in it
@son  yeah and it wasn t shoved down our throats in the game
@nikolas ransom  in the first game ellie and bill being gay wasn t their entire personality  merely a nuanced extension of it  people just be making stereotypical gay characters that have one trait  gay. straight characters get given more traits than just straight so why can t gay characters  doesn t matter what they are which is the mantra of the left but it seems to matter more than anything that s all
@   mae     have you not watched the show  ellie liking girls is not her whole personality. not at all. the hell are you even talking about  when has ellie ever brought up the fact that she liked girls  when has that ever been the focus until this episode
@nikolas ransom  i was speaking more about the second game  as i mentioned the first game not doing that sorry for not being clear enough   ellie being gay and everyone knowing it in the second one was literally a priority  now don t get me wrong her being gay isn t a problem  obviously  i loved her and dina as a couple but the second game and show is a lot less subtle with things like that. hell even joel and tess were exaggerated in the show  it was never actually said in the game that joel and tess were together  the only tell was when she dies and says something along the lines of  there s enough here for you to feel some obligation to me so you get her to tommys  or when bill says they re always together but in the show they re literally spooning  just wasn t needed in my opinion
its in the game. the game is from 2013  its a dlc  and is exactly how it is in the game. just with a minor changes like stuffs happening in some places. but the kiss and the moments are exactly how it was in the game.
plus the kiss in the show is faster than in the game.
the game was never about the zombies it was about joel and ellies relationship and their journey to be fair.
i thought maybe they could just be good friends. didn t need the romance part at all to be a good filler episode. note i never played the game.
@tina l.  i didn t play the game as well but i know this episode is the adaptation of the dlc in the 1st game.
@tina l.  they were good friends but it turns into a romance sort of
why do i always see comments like this as if it s stunning and brave to do such an act.
it s filler. filler can still be canon. walking dead had tons of filler that was pulled straight from the comics. all filler means is an episode that s a detour from the main plot. the main plot would be joel and ellie s journey.
@fluffy bunny  bill and frank s episode wasn t exactly canon. yes bill was gay  yes frank most likely was also gay and had a relationship with bill but it was a toxic situation and nothing like the fan fiction love story hbo portrayed.
spoilers ahead. don t read if you don t want that. i kinda have to spoil to mention this. i definitely think it weird that they have 2 fillers. i am pretty sure that they will be cutting it off halfway through the game roughly. and then resuming. i could be wrong but i feel there is a fair bit of content they haven t done that would be hard to do in a couple episodes. i could be wrong tho. so maybe that s part of the reasoning to multiple fillers  trying to drag it out  i will also say that while still definitely a filler  the ellie one was a little bit less so compared to the previous. i think they were trying to establish that ellie lost someone she cared about and why she ends up staying to help joel. but that said  still a filler. they could have done it in a way that didn t take the whole episode. the thing that will be really cool is to see exactly where they leave off for season 1 and the whole story put together. which is why i always hate episodic releases and i kinda think they are stupid for streaming stuff. cause there is too many shows out there that would do so much much better if just released all at once. for me so far  i ve been watching with my freind so we missed a few weeks. and both filler episodes actually ended up being paired with another episode. so i feel like the filler episodes are slightly less nonoticeable than on their own and the one allotment of time delving into the show for that week. definitely feel it would have benefited from the whole season released at the same time.
this episode was good  bjt coz of bill s story this didn t hit it as it should ve. coz you keep thinking we ve 2 episodes left. i ll keep saying had they made  bill s story shorter then it would ve been better. i personally like the show  but there re drawbacks as i mentioned above.
you know they say we all like to feel represented  but as a gay man myself  for like at least the last ten years i ve felt like media has been forcing a bunch of gay nonsense on people  like its bugged me for years but other people call me a bad gay or some shit for voicing my thoughts....
this why i don t call myself a christian i read the bible too but i don t blindly follow it like sheep!i study it to learn the truth and half of it sounds like pure fantasy!i have the chronological bible as well!
i kind of think they should of had storm reid play ellie.  in all seriousness though when i was a kid judges was my favorite book of the bible.
but it s part of the story of the original game. it s literally exactly how it was in the game... like yeah it s filler but that s the story...
both  filler  episodes expanded the main characters and moved the story forward and were amazing episodes. try watching them. if an episode expands the backstory  it s not filler. story is really part of the word backstory.also  she was asked a question and gave a perfectly reasonable answer. the show has gained audience every week. it s numbers have been incredible. if you don t like it  don t watch it.lastly  criticizing a show is perfectly fine  but to pretend there hasn t been any backlash against the gay aspects of the show is ridiculous. there has been obvious backlash for that.
your terms are acceptable.
it s an amazing zombie apocalypse show with little to no zombies or action. zero threat of danger as the characters make loud noises and aren t worried about their surroundings at all.
tfw you ve tapped out your writer s bench in the 1st season and the story was already pre-written.
since i like almost nothing on tv  that s really easy...  especially as i don t have cable and won t pay for hbomax as a streaming service.
thanks!
honestly this episode doesn t bother me as much as the last gay one. and not because its women instead of men  but because this was an entire story the game went into. i didn t mind playing through the dlc either. and i can add that ellie and riley weren t tonguing eachother down or being overly intimate.
it s not pandering it s programming
it s not a filler episode  it established ellie s backstory.
this show could ve been the walking dead big but they ve dropped the ball on this. i haven t watched since the bloater episode
i just catch the reviews now and then but from the looks of it they are now covering the left behind dlc. that being said it becomes clear when someone is just trying to shoove their agenda down ones throats. i dont even think the original game had that much to it.
because you are not allowed to not watch just because it didn t click with your taste.
don t like it  don t watch...  i accept those terms. i actively boycott marvel  amazon  disney and every corporation in entertainment that shoves sexuality  race and gender in my face. replace them with great characters and hell  i might watch something you create but after four years of boycotting hollywood films at the cinema and most tv shows and streaming services i m not holding my breath. p.s. i worry that melonie s cat is not getting the representation it deserves in these videos sometimes  so i am hereby nominating it for best actor in a supporting role.
tell em!!
ellie s white and riley is black
they re not zombies
@weapons of warfare  seriously  ok   infected undead  or whatever you want to call them
@weapons of warfare  the fans of this show are..
the infected are not the main focus of the show  they were not the main focus in the game.
@nani  they them zambies
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  sounds like a boring game
the game is also this the  zombies  take very little prominance.the last of us is like the twd its more about the people and their drama which is why i felt the show would end up like the twds boring seasons.it works better in a game i suppose.
@nani its heavily praised for its story and relationship building between joel and ellie thats about the best of the game yet people do call it a masterpiece i ve played both it and the sequel.the sequel i think proves if the first lacked a good story it would ve been forgotten or hated.but thats just my opinion.
@nani  it s quite a good game with a wonderful story.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  literally the entire point of the game is to get ellie to the fireflies to make a cure for the zombie plague. they may not have been the focus but they were an important element to the story. to suggest other is ludicrous
@maxximus prime  they were a plot device more then anything
ill stick to the games lol
@jplf the fish  that plot device was used as the basis for the main characters conflict in the finale and characterization for joel being a broken man learning to find hope again in a post apocalyptic world. the zombies seemed pretty damn important to me and as such having them would be an important element to at least give joel s character more depth than him outright saying  we killed people
@maxximus prime  that dude is just some hacktivist troll complaining on every comment
@maxximus prime  it s mind blowing these shills keep saying the infected aren t the focus. you can t make a show like this and not have some action and horror elements in a few episodes. it doesn t need to be the whole episode but come on. you have an hour. telling me they can t throw in a 10 minute section of them being attacked or trying to get by dangerous obstacles  just insane they d leave the infected out. the last of us would not have been as popular if all they had you do is walk through levels with no enemies to face. i d bet my life on it. they only did that to make sure we get boring episodes like 3 7.
@maxximus prime  they are not zombies for one  and the worst threats in their world are other humans. also i never said infected were not a threat  i said the focus was groups of people fighting each other.
@maxximus prime  thats the mcgufffin that gets the story going and keeps it but its not the main focus.the focus is on joel and ellie and besides joel doesn t even let the cure happen at all clearly the focus isn t just about the zombies.its about joel and ellies journey and relationship.the cure is just a goal that gets them through this journey.
@maxximus prime  i mean joels daughter was killed by a soldier. yeah it only happened sort of because of the apocalypse but again the focus is as far i see objectively not about the clickers even the games do not have a lot with them they always made you fight humans more.hell its just like another other average zombie show where humans are the real threat message except at least there is a different focus here.
@krazeesk8r  i mean yes the show needs that but i mean if you played the first it really isn t about the infected at all or else why would joels whole goal change at the end anyways it was clearly saying something bigger i mean.bioshock isn t really about rapture despite it being much of the setting either its about the philosophy and ideals that built it.
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  they are basically no different from many variations of zombies.fungus doesn t make them that unique.
@chandller burse  as a plot device  no they don t really operate any differently than zombies. they are a physical threat  that s all. but the fact that they are still having a conscious experience  at least in the early stages of infection  is i think the most terrifying premise in the whole tlou universe. far worse than to be a zombie is to be an aware passenger in your own body. listening to them stumble around in the game while clearly in agony was always unsettling.
@nani  won best game of the 2010s. the main focus of the game was joel building a father  daughter bond with ellie while traveling across the country with her to the fireflies so they can make a vaccine from her but he cares about her too much to lose her. reminds him of his daughter. that s what made the game great.
have you played the game   lol n no action idk i think we re watching two different shows
@thatguywhodoesstuff14  they are the main focus in the game though half of the narrative for the first half of the game is literally why ellie is bit and not turning!
@nani  that s because he s wrong
@chandller burse  the last of us is nothing like twd and honestly if you think twd is boring you have no sense of story telling!
@chandller burse  the second one got hate for the death of joel nothing else
@maxximus prime  yeah and the show is none of this!
@chandller burse  the mcguffin is the entire point of joel s character my guy  and like i said several damn times  while the zombies weren t the focus  they were still an important element. he s a fucked up dude who went through utter hell trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world. without that then he s just a normal dude. and if it isn t about the zombies then all the worldbuilding around the zombie apocalypse doesn t matter to anything  right  the zombies were an important element to the world and joel s character and even his final decision  sort of. in a vacuum the whole point is  would you do what joel did and sacrifice a cure for the world to save your daughter figure   the game needed to do a good job of both worldbuilding and characterization to make you think about it. of course maybe it failed but that s another thing.the entire game s setting  characterization of the main character  and her it s plot are due to the zombies. whether or not they were the focus doesn t mean they didn t have an important role. getting rid of that would make the game lose about 60  if it s charm.
@maxximus prime  i am not saying the show is right to lack zombie scenes.i am just saying the focus was never on them.
@maxximus prime  and if they were the focus this just be another average mild zombie game out of the hundreds there is anyways.
@amador cortinas  there is hate for abby hate for the story in general hate for the treatment of ellie and many other things.i ve seen this first hand peoples criticisms it is not just joels death.
@amador cortinas  the show is a soap opera its boring as shit after season 1 and 2.most early fans admit this.comic fans admit this.george romero even called it that then again he has a lot of odd opinions.its my view and do not say i am objectively wrong because its a opinion the show sucked after the first two seasons.
@amador cortinas  they are not the main focus of the game the main focus is entirely joels escort journey with ellie mainly its focused on their relationship the zombies are there to establish this journey and relationship more than anything.
@chandller burse  but they re there constantly i should have said one of the main focus because they re still a major focus regardless.
@amador cortinas  they don t matter as much as the other focuses really.this series is about fighting humans more than uncharted even was.
@chandller burse  george has made good zombie movies and created the zombie as we know it today but he hasn t made anything as good as the walking dead do you really think calling it a soap is a negative mark  soap s are some of the most popular forms of entertainment and that s where all of the best actors and actresses come from!
@amador cortinas  eh day of the dead is honestly a bit more interesting than the entire twd and has a larger focus on the zombies too than the show later does.its also scarier.same for dawn and dawn s remake by zach snyder.resident evil is also better even putting aside the other monsters.dead rising is better and has more interesting drama.
@amador cortinas  soap operas are boring average and most modern ones are bad.and it shouldn t be a soap opera it should be a thriller with horror elements drama is there sure but its not the entire piece.at least the comic and telltale games don t feel that way all the time.and the early season felt really good.it got duller and duller.
@chandller burse  i never said they were the focus  i said they were an important element to the story that shouldn t be ignored
@chandller burse  i was going to agree with you until you said the resident evil movies are better i would rather watch dragon ball evolution!
@chandller burse  their is a reason why zombie movies end at the end of the movie because to keep it going it has to become a soap of sorts it has to be about the survivor s not just the zombies none of those movies you mentioned would ever work as a show they would probably only get two seasons!
@amador cortinas  i meant the games not the films.
@amador cortinas  i meant the games not films
@chandller burse  of course the game s are better the last of us is way better in comparison too but so are the telltale walking dead games but twd show is far better than the last of us show in many ways and this is bad considering the game is by far better than anything on the list with the exception of the four re games that i mentioned!
@amador cortinas  i haven t seen the hbo show but the twd is a borefest to me thats all.
@amador cortinas  i don t know i don t even think tlou1 is the best game nd ever made.thats my opinion its story is the best part but thats not enough for a game to be a masterpiece for me.
@nani  the game was amazing u should play it so u can understand the show better
@amador cortinas  no way u said twd is a better show then the last of us gimme whatever ur smoking
@dakoata  i m starting to realize that the show was probably meant for people who played the game
@nani  a bit yeah. there s a lot of lines scenes and areas that are based off the game or taken from the game. also in a lot of the game u do mainly kill people instead of the infected. i don t remember where i heard this from but they wanted the last of us threat to be people to show how dark people can be inside when pushed into a crazy situation  like the guy that ellie shot or the new episode what david is feeding his people and what the people did to the military after taking over the qz for some examples
@dakoata  i played both have zero interest in watching this show anymore really.i think game adaptations are almost a pointless effort at least for games like this narratively focused type.sony s last farray here was ratchet and clank which failed sad that a platformer adaptation didn t take off so the others could also be finished.some sound like a good idea like ghost of tsushima but the game is always better its a better experience adapting that story to show or film is always gonna lack something.
@amador cortinas  good twd should ve ended after two seasons amc milked the shit out of it.the comic ended before the show did and the comic did it better i bet.
@chandller burse  literally had his town rigged up with traps for the zombies and muttered about ensuring that said traps were set. without the zombies bill wouldn t exist. he was scared of that whole section of town precisely because of the zombies. to suggest that the zombies didn t matter to bill s character is staggerinly asinine
@chandller burse  yeah u can t add a lot of gameplay aspects to a film and u can t follow the game completely or you ll lose a lot of views because of how predictable it is
@maxximus prime  can you even remotely prove that those traps were for the wandering infected and not the hunters and soldiers he seems to be setting up warning signs for which he lists in the map you re probably referencing also traps that are bombs seem kind of useless for a single infected that randomly wanders all it would do is attract more when he has to redo it. now for a person with a group it kills one and attracts infected to ward the others off.he uses infected as a trap too he does not fear them as much as people dude joel even literally says in the university level he uses them.
@maxximus prime  he was weary of that section because of the infected yes also why there is probably no traps there lol.and he also probably felt that section needed no traps the infected would clear anyone off anyways and he couldn t clear them out on his own.being afraid of the most infected filled part of town is not proof all his paranoia and traps were for the infected in fact if those parts had no traps it proves it wrong.
@chandller burse  the very first trap we saw was triggered by a wandering infected my guy! we even fought a whole horde of infected in which we re given gear specifically to fight said infected! the whole reason bill is so paranoid isn t just due to the possible intruders  it s also due to the infected. remember when the very first time we saw bill he was saving joel from a bunch of infected after joel triggered one of his traps    to suggest the character that s paranoid because of the zombies isn t paranoid of the zombies is fucking mental. it being effective isn t the point  the point is those traps exist because he s paranoid. we even saw a single infected trigger one of his traps  and he does indeed need to reset them because he even mutters about neglecting resetting up the traps! bill explicitly states that he s scared of both the zombies and the humans. it s just that the zombies are at least predictable. those two things are not mutually exclusive. both the humans remaining and the zombies can be a threat. i do not see why it s so hard for you to grasp that the zombies are an important element to the world of the last of us
@maxximus prime  that was to show the traps and how they worked it does not mean much.i am sure bill doesn t mind his traps taking out infected but again its impractical for that to be their entire purpose.he wants his town secure from others so letting infected roam and setting traps that attract more makes sense.
@maxximus prime  uh the point about the traps joel gets stuck in is kind of moot why  because have you ever thought the whole point of thay trap was the infected the reason they show up is the loud bang the weight makes when it hits and joel is low enough to get ate so clearly that trap was made to get people killed by them.i am not saying bill doesn t fear them. i am not saying they aren t important to an extent i am saying they are not the entire purpose or the biggest one for why he uses both them and traps.also if he was so afraid of them anyways why even stay in a town full of them because he fears people more.thats why.
@chandller burse  there were no traps because he had to close it off because it was too dangerous. bill  joel  and ellie were overrun and nearly killed multiple times due to the zombies. the fact that an entire section of the town was off limits due to the zombies means the zombies were a bigger threat  at least in that section. to suggest the zombies didn t matter in bill s mind is fucking mental. that last sentence is worded terribly. the notion that an entire section of town being filled with zombies means the infected are a threat. his paranoia was precisely due to the zombies. that s why he said joel was crazy for trying to go into that section of town. also  those traps were for infected. bill isn t suicidal  he won t go into that part of town to kill some zombies when that would ensure his death
@maxximus prime  oh my god i literally just said that i didn t say they didn t matter.
@maxximus prime  how was it worded badly if his paranoia and fear is from the zombies in his town then why does he specifically live in a town overrun with them with zero people he trusts to help him maintain safety  except the one who died and is part of the reason he has trust issues.why does he set traps for infected but seemingly never clears them out of sections of the town and even makes traps clearly designed for people to get eaten what you re saying is as odd as you think what i am saying is lol.
@chandller burse  the whole point of the trap was to catch infected. the fact that a whole horde was spawned is why bill needs those traps and all his defenses in the fucking first place. to say that bill just let s infected chill to kill any possible intruders is not only asinine but shows a complete disregard for bill s character just because you want to stick your hand in your ears and say the important zombie fungus isn t actually important to game. i already said that numerous times and acknowledged that both of those can be true at the same time. if so then you re arguing for literally no good reason.because he s got a good routine down and knows what he s doing. he would rather take his chances here in a location he could defend that s close enough to something resembling civilization with resources he could use without the downside of living under a tyrannical military. regardless you can be scared of something and live in the same place. happens all the time with people who live in shady neighborhoods and are terrified of what could happen to them.
@chandller burse     the traps showcase that bill is paranoid and adds extra worldbuilding and characterization. i do not see how that is not at least competent writing. that is the entire purpose of the traps. if it wasn t then. bill can both defend himself from the infected and any possible intruders. the two are not mutually exclusive. and like i said  specifically letting his town get overrun just to use them as distractions for any possible intruder is counterintuitive
@chandller burse  it s worded badly because you implied bill setting up traps and muttering to himself isn t a sign of his paranoia. he even muttered about not resetting a trap for the zombies and needing to move his base to a whole different part of town. all of this just to keep any potential intruders out. it s more likely that bill is defending his town from both zombies and any potential intruders and is just taking advantage of the zombies by happenstance rather than intentionally driving them in. because if he was that would defeat the whole purpose of surviving because he would put himself at risk of getting bitten for no good reason. because he believes that getting too close to people and building connections is how you get killed. that would be counterintuitive to his goal which is survival  which is why bill intentionally loading his town with zombies make no sense. if he s going the extra mile to say  fuck connections  survival is more important   why in the hell would he intentionally rig his town with zombies which would decrease his chances of survival  that doesn t make any sense. it s more likely that he s defending himself against both the infected and humans and as such uses the infected to his advantage. otherwise why bother making his job of smuggling stuff infinitely harder than it has to be the same reason that the paranoid survivalist hasn t gathered every bit of ammo in the town or food that joel stumbles upon in this section. it s this little thing called gameplay being king for the purpose of the player. the fact that the game broke it s own rule of having limited ammo during the fridge traps and giving you unlimited ammo is walking proof of this.  happens all the time in video games. you need enemies to fight so obviously bill won t have entire areas cleared out even if he should. he also won t give a damn if you loot stuff from his room. i believe that bill is paranoid and defends himself from both the infected and humans to survive. you believe that bill intentionally hordes infected in his town to kill any intruders even though that runs counter to his character. we are not the same.
@chandller burse  i agree it s not the best game nd did that would have to be uncharted but it s still a masterpiece in acting and graphics not much is better unless it s another nd game or something square-enix!
@maxximus prime  i believe he hates humans more than infected but fears both.we are not the same and i am not even what you assume.
@maxximus prime  the looting stuff almost makes no sense since he gets pissed at ellie for touching anything.
@maxximus prime  if its to trap a single infected why it also attracts a horde as seen with joel how can bill be that dumb
@maxximus prime  i am basically saying bills character to me feels like he s saying like many other cliche zombie films but in a more direct statement to joels own character that humans are worse. they are too untrustworthy. just like when bill says to joel  you should know that more than anyone and honestly that feels like joels character he ends up choosing what he can trust what he can love over humanity as a whole.
@amador cortinas  red dead 2 and 1 is better in acting and 2 is better in graphics.spider-man ps4 is better in graphics.the witcher is better in writing and graphics especially if you count the dlcs.
@chandller burse  you believe that he intentionally makes it so that thing he fears swarms his home and he isn t afraid because he lives in a town full of them. you are actively backtracking on your position because you re brain is desperately trying to tell you that you re being a moron. in the game the infected are actually an issue and are important for the plot even if they re not the focus
@maxximus prime  i never said he intentionally herds infected ever.i said he clearly leaves the infected alone to a point so he can use them as an extra defense.
@maxximus prime  why do i have to reiterate once more mate that i never ever ever said they were completely unimportant to this stupid game.thanks for making me legit start to resent the last of us series again i use to do it because i was a dumb kid who hated nd for abandoning jak and daxter for  realistic  games.but now i feel that feeling coming again from this dumb debate about bill.jesus.
@maxximus prime  okay dude if you can pull the gameplay story segregation here then i can also pull it for when that first infected ran into the bomb which was clearly to show the player those exist and how they work not to make an exact statement on bills desire.also that barely means crap because its apart of the story.and are you seriously telling me that trap is meant for one infected  and risks attracting multiple more when bill comes to take care of it how is it so dumb he intended some of his traps for people that trap is also right outside of a door infected can barge through them but probably rarely do unless agitated.that trap may be meant for infected too or at least he doesn t mind but its pretty odd he designed a trap that doesn t kill them but rathers hang them up low enough for other infected to be able to reach them and also makes a loud noise.think dude please think.
@chandller burse  luddonarritive dissonance. gameplay taking priority over story. it happens all the time. it s the same thing in insomniac games spider-man games where spider-man doesn t kill people even though he launches them off of buildings  throws manholes at them  and if you do it right  makes it so that enemies shoot their buddies. alongside this joel getting pressed ellie adds depth to his character because he s lying to himself. before this he was warming up to ellie  laughing at her jokes showing that he s actually caring for her.  him being a dick to her later is him trying to pretend he doesn t care about ellie even though he does. so that contraindication kinda sort works. if actually very much works
@maxximus prime  in spider-man when he launches them off buildings you can see a web gadget pull them to another building.just a note as someone who played that game alot.its also not as offensive as batman killing people since peter has brutally murdered villains before in comics anyways need more of that.
@maxximus prime  ah yes ludonarrative dissonance something nd has been criticized for many times and apparently has even said themselves they don t believe in  which actually is funny and implies they are just denying criticism lol
@chandller burse  the existence of those bomb tripwires only exists in bill a portion of the game. they re combined character building with gameplay to establish that bill is a paranoid nut job even if his paranoia actually makes sense. add to the fact that the player can find notes left around with bill reminding himself to do things only reinforces this. i never said the trap was for one infected  i said the trap was infected. even if it was only for one infected  what the hell does that matter  several other traps including bomb rigs are only for one infected. it isn t dumb that he intends some traps for people  it s dumb that you believe that he intentionally lures infected to his base solely use for any human survivors. as i said  it s more likely that he s set traps for both and just uses the zombies to his advantage.those two points are right and why gameplay is king is a thing in story based games like this. the whole thing is set up like a mini uncharted setpiece and is impractical. hence why the unlimited bullets and breaking it s own rules about limited ammo to give you infinite ammo.  i am thinking  you re just refusing to take my points into consideration
@chandller burse  and as someone who also plays that game  the sheer force of having your body change direction at that angle  and that speed  and landing on a hard surface would kill you. hell  air launch alone is enough to kill a goon. the amount of force it would needed to launch someone their entire body height in the air by their fucking jaw would instantly rip their head off and kill them  but it doesn t because we need to have cool gameplay.you also ignored the part where spidey can make it show that enemies can riddle their buddies with guns or launch manhole covers at them and they aren t dead at all. spider-man should be killing these guys under any circumstances. but be isn t because gameplay takes priority over realism
@chandller burse  you re saying that shit right now in the same comment you re saying you don t  it s just too fucking perfect!
@chandller burse my argument is  while the zombies are not the focus they are important to story via these elements through characters and characterization ..if you can agree with that then you re getting pressed at me for no good reason. regardless this whole time you ve been actively trying to downplay the zombies on regards to bill s level to try and say  they didn t matter   even though they matter a great deal because without them  chunks of the story wouldn t make sense.
@chandller burse  all good recommendation s i haven t played either of them so i wouldn t know but i m definitely going to play them now thanks bro!
if you want more action just play the game. jezz.
@claudio pe a  their trying to make it realistic but it s less realistic with less action!
@maxximus prime  they don t matter as much as humans.humans are the real monsters as cliche as that is its what this series often says.
@chandller burse  they still matter  however  even if they aren t a focal point or whatever. if they didn t then the entire point behind the game falls apart because there s no zombie apocalypse which means there s no point to the journey. it also gives joel s character more depth because of his hardened demeanor fucking him up with what he had to do just to survive.humans only became monsters due to the very real monsters that spawned into their world  which is why  humans are the real monsters  is ludicrous.
@claudio pe a  woah  people want the the action show to have action in it  if isn t like any half way component writing could use action sequences in order to advance the characters in a way that satisfying and as if action sequences and storytelling aren t mutually exclusive. mind blowing  isn t it
@maxximus prime  humans have always been the real monsters in our reality though which is why that cliche exists at all.zombies just eat you.what do people do  anything.
@chandller burse  those zombies that just  eat you  wiped out 60  of the population and is part of the reason for societal decay. if they really wanted a  humans are the real monsters  then say  fuck the zombies  and have a regular post apocalyptic world via some natural disasters instead of the zombies.  the issue is the entire point behind this journey is to deliver an immune girl who can t get infected from said monsters  and if they aren t a threat then there s no point in this quest to begin with.
@maxximus prime  the zombies and nuclear worlds are more or less a backdrop a reason to have such a world to tell that story they want in.fallout isn t about the nuclear war that occured 200 years before the games events.its about human nature among other things but the actual war is done and over with there is pressing matters just like its been 20 years since the virus took over and humans are clearly use to it and just trying to survive from it and mostly themselves.
@maxximus prime  joels entire decision to choose ellie over a potential cure is not only his love for her as a daughter but also as far i think nd also meant that humanity essentially made its boat it will just destroy itself some other way if not cordyceps and that the question is constantly and irritatingly brought up in the fandom about  do we deserve a cure
@maxximus prime  maybe this is the same mindset as the other anti sjw and anti politics in games dude who told me that dead rising couldn t have a consumerist message  despite carlito literally saying so in the game once  because its a zombie game lol.then again this isn t political necessarily its social i guess.
@chandller burse if fallout is two centuries removed from a nuclear war then no duh if isn t about nuclear war. the difference here is that the zombies are still an ever present threat to the point where the fireflies are still looking for a cure and again  is the entire reason this journey is even happening in the first placealso  first you said the  zombies are important just not a focus   and now it s  the zombies don t matter at all pick one.
@chandller burse  literally never played dead life  not interested. as for the  girl with all the gifts   never even heard of it. but so long as the worldbuilding and characterization acknowledges that the zombies exist  are an ever present threat  and treated as such  then sure. it would still be dumb to use zombies when they supposedly don t matter  so why bother having them and again  not just set your series in a generic post apocalyptic setting via natural disaster.
@maxximus prime  i am not saying they don t matter at all how the hell is saying that the game is making the point that society is gone and humans are surviving from whats left and the infected but humans seem to be presented as worse in this world the same as  they don t matter at all
@maxximus prime  dead rising how did you read dead life from that and its your loss especially if you like serious but somewhat comedic zombie media which is also produced by capcom.
@maxximus prime  why do you keep saying i said they don t matter at all goodness dude this is a deadend we don t understand each other.
@maxximus prime  girl with all the gifts is basically either a major coincidence or was massively ripped off by nd.then again maybe its just because i don t think tlou1 is a masterpiece as much as others.and i never understood the massive praise it gets for how  real  the virus is just because its based on a fungus.when dead island was based on kuru a real neurological disease from eating brains that cannibals contracted in history.and dead rising is also based on a real bee sort of thing with its zombies and then theres dawn of the dead remake with its rabies version.i know this is un related but still this entire thread is nothing but rants anyways.
@chandller burse  because any moment where they re actually important  you re doing your damnedest to say  they don t matter   like how you re repeating the fact that the guy who s clearly paranoid both zombies and humans doesn t actually care about the zombies. i understand you perfectly. you re trying to defend and undefendable position and you re desperately grabbing at straws to try and fit a square peg in a round hole
@maxximus prime  bills character to me was just always was the whole  he hates people and distrusts them and he rather be closer to infected than the living and thats pretty much what it almost is.whether he fears infected or not matters little. he clearly distrusts and dislikes people its why he lived alone for a long time and even with frank he and him stayed so isolated frank got tired of it and up and left or at least tried to.
@maxximus prime  the infected are still just a minor issue in this series narrative despite them being a mcguffin.the game never felt like a horror and when it tries to its short and rare.its about joel and ellie its about humans its why its called the last of us and not something to do with dead or fungus.the zombies have a role yes they matter to an extent but in the bigger picture they are sidelined by joel and ellies bond and joels ultimate struggle to deliver her to a certain demise for an uncertain reward he does not really want for a species that has so far proven to be untrustworthy and too savage to deserve a second chance at civilization.
@chandller burse   i m going to ignore the fact that bill is clearly paranoid of the zombies hence why he rigs his town up with booby traps and leaves notes for reminders of him to move his stuff around and ensure that he survives and the portion of town filled with infected that he doesn t go into literally just said  the concern about the kinfected part of bill s character doesn t matter   thanks for proving my point about how you re willing trying to defend something that s indefensible
@maxximus prime  any moment i say  i do not believe they are unimportant you say i did say that.maybe i am going in circles because this crap has been both amusing and agitating.but as far my belief goes its not undefendable this series is probably the most blatant case of  zombie media that says humans are the real issue  ever besides the walking dead and i guess george romeros older films.
@chandller burse  the english language allows you to convey multiple things with different wording. the fact that you are actively ignoring the part about bill s character where he s obviously portrayed as being paranoid of the zombies is you trying to say  the zombies aren t actually important because the character specifically designed to be good at fighting the zombies because he s scared of them isn t actually scared of the zombies . the only way to do that is if you actively ignore the part where the zombies matter as is with basically joel s entire character  bill s level and his character  henry and sam being  the entire plot point about delivering ellie to the fireflies  and so on and so forth....
@chandller burse  if the infected are only a minor issue then the entire point of the game falls apart because the zombie threat isn t actually a big deal and ellie shouldn t be delivered to the fireflies. it didn t need to be horror to be about the zombies  at least not entirely.the game may not be about the zombies but the zombies still have an important role in regards to characterization  worldbuilding  level design  and so on and so forth. as such the zombies being deleted entirely would ruin a lot of the game from not only joel and ellie s budding relationship it being sidelined doesn t mean the zombies weren t important. that was literally my first argument and you are now regurgitating what i ve been saying since the beginning. and if the zombies are important to that degree then simply getting rid of them because  muh humans  would make the entire story fall flat. if the zombies aren t a threat then the quest to deliver ellie to the fireflies to make a cure is pointless. joel s entire character of being a man hardened by the horrible things he had to do to fight said zombies doesn t matter. bill s paranoia and the entire cause behind civilization s collapse and society doing horrible things within this new world doesn t matter because the zombies themselves don t matter. getting rid of the zombies is about as ludicrous as getting rid of the force in the ot of star wars  which has been my entire point yet you refused to acknowledge it. while not the focus  they provide important elements in other ways  and when i provided and example of that other way  you immediately tried to say the zombies didn t matter to that character even when they clearly did.
@maxximus prime  the part you referenced was always to me a sign bill was desperate to keep his town isolated and alone he sets traps for people as much as infected but honestly if he s not actively clearing the town out which he clearly establishes he won t do then why set traps for a couple infected at a time anyways they clearly serve another purpose.
@maxximus prime  what are you even talking about in the last part i never once said get rid of them.this entire conversation has been a goddamn waste.
@maxximus prime  bills paranoia and isolation is likely a result of the apocalypse yes but considering he lives in a heavily infected town and refuses human activity outside of his smuggles for survival it says a lot more about how he views humans dude.i never said he doesn t fear infected he just clearly probably prefers to be around them than humans.
@maxximus prime  honestly at this point i am almost confused and clearly we may even be saying the same thing.maybe i said some dumb crap i don t know. people in these comment sections range from odd to irritating with these topics so its whatever.all i know is the game has a lot to say about humanity a lot more than it has to say about zombies.so have a nice day sorry for this wasteful interaction.
@chandller burse  the first sentence is a crude version of what i m saying. the zombies are an important element for the characters and worldbuilding even if they themselves aren t the focus. i explicitly stated that in my very first comment and you decided to try and ignore that and say the zombies aren t important. you re only backtracking now because you realized how stupid your argument was
@maxximus prime  i never realized anything i am pretty sure i said this same thing multiple times to you and you kept insisting it wasn t.but oh here we go with the  no no you backtracked  no i didn t and all that wonderful crap that comes from misunderstandings and people thinking they can read others minds.the zombies really don t matter much more than to establish an enemy and situation for the relationship and journey that bonds ellie and joel together anyways the fact its not even original makes it odder especially since neil even said he had an original idea where the virus only affected women which made ellie more special but he directly said that was a  misogynistic  game which it isn t he s just a woke obsessed weirdo who hates his own creativity apparently.all i know is this is what i thought from the beginning.these games also barely feel like they want you to fight the infected anyways the most they appear is in 2 and even then i think you fight more humans anyways.i am not however gonna play this game with you think what you want.this entire thing was pointless we literally circled through the same argument multiple times.and i swear to lord if you take my  they don t matter much besides establishing the world for the story to happen  as  they don t matter at all there is no reason to cure this virus thats the reason for our societys downfall then just don t just don t even reply.
thank you shane!
the walking dead and the last of us are two completely different games
so  you decided that watching a show after one episode was a waste of your time  but you decided it was worth it to write  record  and edit a thirty minute video about why you hate that same show you did not watch  i sure hope the ad money is worth the homophobia.
in defense of this episode  it was damn near identical to the dlc of the game which i personally didn t mind  and i fookin hated episode 3 bc that one was really going for the agenda. granted in the game bill was gay  more so implied until ellie finds that homoerotic magazine   but his character and story was such a drastic departure for the show it was cringe asf. i loved bill and ellie s back and forth in game but that shit didn t happen in the show. it was just  nah i m good. but i m glad i kept watching bc i wanted to see how they handled sam and henry. this episode wasn t too bad compared to the bill one  but i do feel like it ll happen again somehow. still enjoying the show  tho agreed it s overrated. but i d rather watch this instead of walking dead  i ll just skip ep 3 when i do rewatch it right before season 2
i m not religious and even i can see why we probably should be living by jesus christ and the bible. there s more evidence for it than against it. i m starting to not even see it as a religion  but rather a way of life and i feel myself growing closer and closer to god by the day whenever i see these crazy stories...
this happened in the games. ellie turned out to be lesbian.
if you don t like it don t watch it   goes both ways. the woke tend to often forget that.
the show has a   ha gotcha  show for episode 3. i canceled and may watch the show at a later time.
i was about to write a serious rebuttal to the points you made in this video  but when you said you hadn t even fucking watched the episode you are ranting about  i got suspicious and decided to look at the other videos on you channel...and boy am i glad i did. this is just another wds woke derangement syndrome  channel  a safe space for people who are stuck in time.well  i m not gonna crash your little support group here  take care of each other guys. i ll show myself out
this episode was way more faithful to the game than episode 3 was. they followed left behind pretty much to the tee. i understand and agree that if you don t like it  don t watch. my issue is people trying to  compare it to the gay episode 3. they butchered bill just to push   their   gay agenda in our faces. bill never died in the game  tess  much less joel  ever knew who frank was  and bill never died in the game. they even had to romanticize suicide in the show which i feel is the absolute worst thing possible.
i enjoyed the 3rd episode for the most part  i definitely felt it dragging on and boring me  but i enjoyed the reality that even though the world is falling apart and civilization is barely hanging on by thin threads  there are still some small singular pockets of normal  ordinary life and love and not everything is in ruins.
don t mind if i don t!
specifically commented based off the title. while episode 3 was 95  a waste of time. this past episode was literally the left behind dlc. i definitely wouldn t call it filler.
so these days flashbacks are considered fillers
already stopped watching it after the first one. they really need to stop putting their own fear onto us. we re not afraid of you  we re tired of you...big difference.
as a person who has played the main game and the dlc like 8-10 times and hate woke bullshit  but episode 3 and 7 aren t woke bullshit. in bill s backstory of episode 3 yes they changed the way bill and frank relationship went but their relationship has a theme that s key to the relationship joel and ellie   when you find someone you love  you fight to keep them alive.  with episode 7 and ellie s backstory with riley  it shows us why her worst fear is ending up alone and why she wants to keep joel in her life. these two episodes aren t about characters being gay. it s about relationships in general and how important they are in our lives. eps. in a post-apocalyptic world. clearly melonie hasn t played the og game or the dlc. she has no fucking idea what she is talking about.
when you are running a simple 9 episode run you shouldn t even have filler episodes to begin with.  if that is necessary 3 episodes in you clearly don t have enough story to tell.
i mean to be fair my friend has played the game and said that ellie starts dating another girl or something so i kind of get why they are putting that in the tv show
i have seen all but the most recent episode and i say with strong confidence that it is most definitely one of the shows currently streaming. it isn t terrible but it isn t great. it has the ability to burn time in the back ground.
tbf this episode is actually a main point within the story  the other episode fair enough because it had no relevance at all. this one wasn t for the woke points it s an actual plot point within the story. hate all this woke crap more then anyone but can t complain too much on this one  maybe they could of shortened it but it was always going to have to be in the show.
this is why the game will always be superior. ellie s  relationship  with riley in the dlc   and bill s sexuality in the main story   was nuanced   it wasn t shoved down your throat or in your face. it was just there  a natural extension of the character. and ellie was never  hey  i m gay  in the story  either  all she did was kiss riley  in a heated  excited moment where neither character thought about it much. it was nice to have that nuance of not knowing whether ellie was homosexual in general or just with her close friend.  the last of us ii  sadly  blew all this nuance out the water  p.s. this is the first time i ve seen melonie wearing a character on her shirt who s almost as cute as her
i mean i m ok with this episode existing since it was part of the original game but to have it focused on the relationship entirely and not contribute to the overall story  it s just filler. no world building no character development no nothing.
exactly. the grift is so obvious.
@fire and blood  exactly  it s garbage content. also fire and blood username and profile picture!!! nice
i agree with you. this episode is nothing like episode 3 and how that never happened in the game or even dlc for that matter. this episode was done right minus the water gun fight they had in the end
well they don t care about the game just comolsining
if they are gay
if they re gay then yeah lmao
this . i gotta remember this comment.
and what is this fear we re talking about
yall arent afraid of us yet our mere presence anywhere sends yall into a spiral  lmao cope.
since the first game she s lesbian   in the dlc. its not anything new or  filler
umm that s literally how ellie did it in the shows dlc episode. all she did was kiss her in the end out of happiness like the game and based on last of us 2  she s always been gay
@weapons of warfare  always been gay   she s 14
@justlj!  yeah and so what  people can realize they are gay at that age.
you are coping so hard it s nota even funny
@justlj!  helloo. people start having attraction for others by age 12. she also grew up around girls and not boys.
lmao calm tf down
i wouldn t call this a gay filler episode because this is actually the dlc for the last of us part 1 left behind.so clearly did the comments play the game or you would know this is a full 2-3 hour part of the game
don t support people that hate you at an ethnic level.
the gay relationships are not filler they seem like it because it s garbage when compared to the source material it just simply did not do the game s story and character s justice in any way!
instead of gay fillers why not episodes of joel and company being stuck in a underground maze with clickers and a brick to their name for forty minutes to capture the tension of a survivor horror game.
i think the show actually does a pretty good job on not trying to try hard on pandering  i think they actually execute the things that happen in the game respectfully and cinematically which is why most people like this show. the show is pretty entertaining and not as  woke  as you may think imo  you should watch it.
i highly disagree about ellie. i and many other people played it long before the dlc came out. there is no indication of her sexuality. anyone with half a brain can follow and understand the story and see how that would not be a focus at all the entire time.so what if she picks up one of bill s  magazines   partner is never synonymous with  them . in fact  back then they could ve been partners in living and surviving that world without people automatically equating it to gay. the truck scene also shows no indication she is. there was another guy who worked on the game with druckman. when he left....things got worse. take away that dlc and whether she is or not is irrelevant.fun fact  the time with bill and dead frank s body swinging from a rope like some outdated christmas ornament was very brief. that was pandering 101. after the truck scene none of that is mentioned ever again. it s sad so many don t see it.as far as ep. 3 goes. stop at the 22 minute mark. for the last one  watch the short start and skip to the end.ep. 3 ruins bill completely and that is another discussion. as far as these  actors  flapping their mouths and at their age and young career....people don t forget.lastly  the scene with them looking at some very thin  skimpy lingerie and riley flat out saying she was picturing ellie in it......but more for those adults to push for actively make a scene of underage kids like that is nothing but pedo grooming.bella will likely get to the stage of stereotypical  bad hair cut dye feminist as they will brainwash her to be.
the way wanting good story writing is homophobic now lol i wouldn t have minded seeing this side story at all..... if  it actually had something to do with the plot at hand and wasn t repetitive of a past episode lol plus you have to watch it to get like 5 seconds of joe s current status lol
to the gay haters have yall not played the game  seriously
i ve been keeping up but i haven t seen the latest episode yet  not in any rush  this episode was ripped right out of the little mini game released after the first game. i ll get around to eventually watching it maybe i ll binge the show once it s wrapped. start from the beginning but i ll skip episode 3 that was a true filler. this one is canon to the game at least  doesn t have anything to do with the gay stuff it s just a boring dlc for the most part.
i haven t watched tlou tv series because i know what happens in the tlou games!
they got drunk  tbh this wouldn t confirm anything about their sexuality lol
maybe people don t wanna see filler episodes.  the 2 greatest shows of all time  the sopranos and breaking bad had  filler  episodes. no one complained. you simply enjoyed the characters in that world  enjoyed the moment. continuously advancing story is impossible and a weird complaint. the gawd damn last of us was brought to life. who the hell thought that would ever happen  and it s successful on top of it  and yet  jagoffs still complain  about dumb shi and they re complaining in a way that s hypocritical and disguised covers what their actual beef is. the last of us gets weird scrutiny that not even the best shows ever have gotten  like every episode has to be an absolute banger. unlike baboon brains  i love the characters  i love the character building  and an expansion on a world i love. so yeah  if you don t like it then don t watch. maybe  uhh  stick to marvel movies or something
joel s brother has a new wife. the audience gets told  she is family  and they hold hands. that s it. so for a hetero couple that s what the audience is shown. but for gay characters there is 2 full episodes dedicated to them. yes both are filler but it s obvious propaganda pushing  the message.  episode 7 doesn t push the story forward in any way. in the 1st 5 mins she stitches joel up and then flashback for the next hour.
they left out some of the best parts from the game for this  they ruined bill s storyline by having him commit suicide before they even got to his house and they missed a lot of the content from when they met joel s brother. also they have barely shown the infected compared to the game. i quit watching because they keep getting farther and farther away from the storyline that made the game great.
don t worry  mutant-looking girl. didn t bother with this episode  so save your sorry breath. my response to the nonsense reid utters. xd
lol. @meloniemacgoboom - fr.   father  that denotes a priest  which is actually a role in the catholic church.
melonie  i think i ve said this before  but i miss the bible verses at the end of your videos. they were a breath of fresh air that was also unique compared to most nerd culture streamers. anyone who didn t want to listen to them could always take the same advice and just not watch it if they didn t like it.
you do know  that lesbian kiss scene was in the game for the last of us left behind dlc right  so really it s accurate  and as for episode 3  i will admit it was a filler but i am glad that they give joeland ellie video game accurate shirts like they wear at the beginning  i still enjoy pedro pascal as joel and bella ramsey as ellie  the acting bella gave for this was very good  the part where she finds out that she got bitten and how scared and freaked out she was  that was spot on. but either way i am looking forward to what the next episode is gonna deliver.
hmmmm... those words are golden when used. it gives off a red flag to not actually watch something or buy something  especially when it comes to these woke people. i can not wait for more videos of this kind  about how  the last of us  has lower and lower views. lol!
love the nails
left behind isn t a filler though lol
ohhhh. thank you  i was so confused
she wasn t saying it wasn t accurate  only that it was a second filler episode when you only have 9 episodes.  and it was the actress who said  if you don t like it  don t watch it . melonie isn t telling anyone to not watch it - it s the show s own stars.
@garry upton  episode 3 was the true filler episode. the main story is almost over so if they didn t add this we would ve only got 8 episodes
@garry upton  i was reminding people dude  and besides at least the show is actually good and not repetitive like the walking dead
i m gay. i played the original game and had no idea it had lgbt characters because it was never a focus of the game. i did not play the dlc because it was just treading through crappy backstory. lgbt themes are irrelevant to the original game  unequivocally. however i realise they are more prominent in the second game. regardless  i think all the backlash and moaning is dumb. the original story was not gay  it was about ellie and joel s relationship  but i think having fun with an adaptation and adding in lgbt narratives is a nice idea. any episode of a show that stalls the main plot is dumb though  i don t care what it s about.
when movies and tv shows are more interested in the sexuality of the characters rather than the actual story then yeh i won t watch!
kinda hard to keep a straight forward story when you spend the majority of the screen time and character development on not the main characters and their current situation. granted i know this one is the dlc and about ellie but how do you explain the last 4 episodes
imagine being so sad and full of hate that you feel the necessity to talk shit on the internet about something you don t even know or are interested.
if anyone has played the game should have absolutely zero problem with this.the only problem with that episode was that it was boring.
i was like no please sont cant we just have normal best friends anymore....
this is something that happens in the game  but  they should take their own advice yes... and everyone bitching about it here  should do the same. so funny how this  don t like it don t watch it read it etc  topic continues to be an echo chamber of hypocrisy on both all sides  and those who get pissed when they hear that  are guilty of it the most typically lol.
i just don t want to watch anything these days. quite sad really.
what caught my attention was that they used a fungus as the reason for a  zombie  apocalypse  and they way it got transferred made sense too. at first it just seemed like the show would be different compared to others  but then the director or creator or whatever admitted to tricking the audience  and that kinda behavior to me is disgusting. even more so when you re telling the opposite side to stop their  indoctrination as well. it s literally just sick.
i didn t hate the episode because it was pretty close to the dlc. it s just annoying that they ve had two out of seven episodes which have essentially been filler arcs for side characters rather than developing the relationship between joel and ellie. it doesn t have enough impact because they haven t had enough interaction  unlike the game and have no chemistry  which is because the actors aren t great either . we don t need gay storytime neil! we need good story! stop pandering. don t come at me twitter i m gay lol
love this video!
like saints row won t watch it hahahi mean buy it
i mean reid is right tho  i hate women was as much as the next but this was in the game and is a much needed dive into where ellie came from before joel so i can t really agree that it s woke
the gay of us is faaaabulous darhlings oh my!
i m not understanding why people are complaining  this episode is straight out of the game
episode 3 was out of place and deserved the outrage but episode 7 wasn t. it s the left behind dlc we all knew it was coming in the show!
whether they are filler or not the episodes are still great.
lmfao what joke is this  filler
you should watch episode 5 at least -- if not purely just for the battle near the end.
that s not what they meant by tricking  and you know it.when they say  trick  they mean not having bill and frank   and later ellie and riley   say i m gay  and allowing the story to show not tell  and thus people realise that gay people being in love is the same as straight people loving each other and just as real  now that s hardly indoctrination.
just haters  because it s still  cool  to hate tlou
the dlc -- naughty dog chose to keep this story separate from the main game because it detracted from joel and ellie s relationship. they discuss this in the making of lou. this episode would have worked as a standalone between season 1 and 2.
@north  there s a thing called character development. if you ve actually watched tv shows every shows have episodes which disconnect from pushing the main story to expand more on the characters. this is no different. you re reaching to complain. that s why you re not a writer
how many more of these are we going to get i m now convinced this was a trojan horse series.better off playing the game instead.
oh boi. at least i wasn t an important actor. i think.there s only two episodes left so to all the people who ve been swearing that they don t like the show can celebrate after march 12th also this episode wasn t as great as the others
you may have a  filler  argument with changes in ep 3 but the dlc integration is a strong addition for ellie s character arc regardless where it falls into the exposition.
i told u lol i m a man of my word have a great night melonie  oh btw if i may ask is it true u used to live in davenport iowa  just asking my family was originally from there
it was just like it showed in the og game from 2013. the last of us is about a lgbtq character. anyone who played the game knew what was going to happen in this episode.
bruh it s in the game
i m already bored with the last of us even before the clear and admitted push of a certain agenda.
you know why i don t take bible seriously cuz man have changed a lot times to their  own goals
i really loved this video. maybe your most based video ever.
is that strawberry shortcake
it s actually not a filler it s from the game and it was a good episode. now episode 3 was trash and not even part of the game  that episode deserves the hate lmao.
we re the most annoying people on the planet! but you must like us! you have to like us!    nobody can force me to like or approve of something that i don t. nice try  head on back to the other side of the rainbow please.
this was literally in the game.
i don t know where the idea that catholics christians hate people who are of the alphabet community. when i was in catholic school  no one there  the staff  or the priest  told us to hate these people. i m sure they told us that it was a sin and they probably encouraged the students not be like that but it s their right to do that. we were taught to love everyone.
how god is using your platform is awesome. what a blessing. just a reminder you re not alone. your family in christ is right here supporting you.
guess im not watching this episode ...
i don t know why people even bothered watching this series since they already know the story devolves in the cringe sequel.
how are you going to judge people for wanting representation when there are countless stories that focus on straight characters plus this is canon content so atp you re just hating trying to cover it up as  i just want a good story  when it is a good story you just focusing on one thing that shouldn t matter
maybe people are upset because they were told it would be a zombie show but instead what they got was a gay romance series.
ok  just to play devils advocate  it s not like this episode was an ass pull. it s based on actual dlc from the game.
this was in the game though  as an expansion
@beast4000  and it was because of ellen page at the same time.
@crystalx oof  wtf does page got to do with this   page was never involved with the game. she never made the game
@crystalx oof  the expansion came out wayyy before ellen page changed to elliot lol wut are you saying
bill and ellie were gay in the game
the series is about people so showing relationships makes sense  you just are upset because gay people were shown in a positive light.
cope.
if you think this episode isn t essential storytelling  then you have totally missed the point of this entire show.
when they make virtually everything under the sun suddenly gay  trans   interracial it definitely makes people wonder who s behind the agenda   the motive..
the book of judges clearly demonstrates the nature that we are all born with  the nature that works according to the law of sin and death. this is why we need to go to the cross  so the old nature can be crucified and so we can be born of the spirit of god to receive a new nature  christ s nature  that works according to the law of the spirit of life that is in christ. right  i m done. love you  mel!
this girly is the biggest  anti-woke  crowd panderer i ve ever seen
i don t think you played either game just yknow  based off your commentary. ellie is a main character who is in love in both games  and she just happens to be gay too. just stop watching if you don t want that. there will be more  gay filler  that you hate oh so much so honestly just quit while you are ahead. leave the last of us for those who appreciate and enjoy that aspect of it instead of spreading cringe commentary on the internet.oh and btw! that entire episode is based off of everything that happened in game. it s crucial to ellie s character and backstory and adds more emotion and depth to her.
i watched 3 episodes  didn t mind the  gay  episode  it was actually pretty good. but i haven t watched since just because the show overall hasn t been good enough to make me look forward to watching it.
i think narrative based video games getting a tv movie adaptation is dumb  like it s literally just the game without the gameplay.
reading the comments is funny
7 00it is a good story. you just mad characters are gay. with literal censorship codes in mid to late 1900s erasing queer people  having them be seen on screen is not narcissistic  irony is real here .
i would rather watch paint dry than watch anything that netflix makes.
you re right. thank you for speaking up and being courageous!
there is no point.
oh well  i ll just play the original game or watch the cut scenes on youtube.
okay
you did know this episode was based on a dlc  right  it s not really new  and if you played the og game  hell  even the remaster  you know this was going to be presented in the show. wait  how can it be filler  when it s part of the game s canon  so you don t much like seen people represented and they should be segregated from storytelling  newsflash  the last of us is considered to be one of the best told stories in a generation. why do you think the creator of chernobyl gave druckmann the opportunity to make this happen. if you were put in charge of choosing what stories should be told  the entertainment landscape would be very boring and bleak. like ben shapiro s western movie.
i think it s hilarious that you think g4s failed startup  and the most popular show on the most popular channel on cable are the same thing. because it s politically suitable for you.
yeah people knew there were gay characters but that wasn t the focus of there character like they are making it now
i recently got a free trial of hbo max as one of the perks with game pass ultimate  but the last of us is one show there that i won t even bother watching.
i also have not been watching it.
so stoked that you aren t afraid to speak about the word using your platform. keep up the good work. god bless
i never even interpreted it as completely  gay  in the game or the show  we know now that ellie is gay but it s left up to interpretation that the kiss meant the same thing to riley  it might not have even been that from ellie either  when i first played the game i just saw it as a heat of the moment action because ellie didn t know how to convey to riley how much she loved her and wanted her to stay  with potential for underlying romantic meaning.
i disagree with the dlz being filler and the second episode based on the dlc being filler i disagree 1 000
episode 3 was too much but e7 is part of ellie development and we already knew that from the game. i m probably way more to the right than you melonie but i think sometime you just want to  be extra for no reasons
so you haven t played the game
being homophobic is being a coward.
@volkan kaman  i m not afraid of gay people. so  hardly homophobic. but you re entitled to your opinion. have a good day! i hope you find the lord. i will pray for you.
@elementalghost  a phobia is an extreme or irrational fear or aversion to something.you have an aversion. so yes. you are homophobic. you dont need to be scared of them.
ellie is most certainly gay even just by the first game   dlc  it s pretty obvious with her and riley plus how she reacts to other things. i think you re just in denial about it lol.
to be honest with the current climate i doubt they will ever do a series on the days gone
i dont remember ellie or bill being gay in the original game
i m sorry to say this  but the last of us opened my eyes to the reality of anti-wokeism. it s equally guilty as wokeism. whenever there s gay stuffs  you paint it as  propaganda  or  woke.  i think anti-woke people don t understand the difference between actual woke representation and normal representation. the series was always clear with it s premise  human connection. it s not all about zombies and fighting. video games will also make it clear. ep 3 and ep 7 were never political in the way they portray gay people. it was non-stereotypical  emotionally charged and humane representation of two people in love not two men or two girls in love. they are largely symbolic and relevant to nuanced mentality of characters. it s more of psychological exploration of human connection.i hope you ll realize that being apolitical is the best position out there. leftists and rightists are wrong. rightists aren t unbiased or  that  accepting. they are equally capable of purporting the propaganda  i m sure you are smart enough to know that. trust me. i was in your position several months ago. guess what  i realized how much contradictions i was affirming with.
but why would you think it s filler when it s dlc in the game and it gives context to the character and their thought pattern. and yes the game has lgbtq themes so complaining about it is actually a little weird to me when it s coming from the source material.  it wasn t like they swapped the characters love interest.
what is reid afraid of  are people rioting in the streets  is she getting death threats  or is she afraid for her job so she decided to attack first
the people obsessed with  being seen  or being represented have no life whatsoever. they feel the need to be vindicated. pathetic.
i m not sure what the problem is with this episode. it s actually in the game! it s dlc for the first game  and the show did it right.   the actress is talking about backlash for something that doesn t have any.
these people live their lives  like the rest of us don t know gay people exist
man  i love how you just say things most people are affraid to say  and how you see christianity as an actual religion  and not some sort of social status.  i m not even christian anymore  lol.  stay this way.   3
awesome. a whole video about religion  .
i loved kung fu movies growing up. never crossed my mind that there weren t white people in them. or if one did show up  i never thought  finally! now i can enjoy this . but then again i never thought of my skin color or sexual preference as my identity.
this was based on the left behind dlc for the game. nothing about it was filler  do your research.
i think to understand the depths of sin you have to look at what jesus said during the sermon on the mount e.g. if you hate your brother you have committed murder in your heart  or if you look lustfully at a woman you have committed adultery in your heart. that s the standard. that s why we all need new hearts etc  see ezekiel 36 . calling out obvious sin is fine  but people need to understand just how far reaching sin actually is. absolutely love your witness  mel
fr.   father  i believe.
while i can agree they are somewhat filler  specially bill and frank s episode  they are still very good. and in my opinion  this is how to properly represent diversity  being gay is not what these characters or episodes are about  but merely details or layers in the characters.
in the third episode  my husband and i just turned off the tv. we are videogame fans  me more than my husband  but i told him to expect the series to deviate from the game s essence. the last of us 2 is ultimately garbage  the producers would take the chance to mix both scripts. the series needs to be more balanced with joe and ellie s relationship  more emotionally appealing compared to playing the game yourself. ellie is a piece annoying 2022 girl on the series and joe feels week  besides i enjoyed pedro performance. i m sorry for those who like it. the series needs to serve the fanbase. they are trying to profit from it.
lol i liked the episode were they called a town in the mountains with a punch of old school americans communist
remember when lesbian stuff was hot and not cringe  i miss those days.
i m not defending leftist agenda  but this episode was based pretty accurately on the game  and told a well known dlc story from the original game that is well accepted  and includes how ellie became infected and reveals how ellie got where she was in the first episode. i don t feel like this episode was filler  the way episode 3 was  which just made up an entire story that had nothing to do with the full story arch. again  i am not defending  but more so clarifying my opinion  because we all known in season 2 this show will most likely become unwatchable  myself included in that.
i haven t watched it and i don t like it they will be upset when joel is killed by abby and season 2 is 80  abby instead lol
that d be a whole lot of extras  probably way more than what the walking dead had for the walkers
bill literally had a gay porn magazine in his truck that ellie finds and he mentioned having a partner
@daury davis  i don t remember that at all
ugh no the last of us franchsie has a history of listening to people with woke ideology  one of the people they listen to said they don t give a shit about bayonetta just the fact that she s hot and that s wrong . this isn t just something that came out of nowhere. also having a history of sexism and not paying their employees definitely not a franchise i recommend supporting if you care about humans at all lmao.
@midnightsqueen94  lol. bayonetta sexualizes women  and that should be normalized  then what s  woke  for you should be normalized too. p.s the last of us show isn t same as the last of us video games. p.s i don t see any  wokeism  you re talking about in the last of us. i think people are overreacting only because anti-wokeism is new sjw. what sort of sexism you re spousing about  and employment thingy is on production team of naughty dog not television series. hbo is responsible for tv series. just because the company has a toxic environment  it doesn t mean their video games are bad. what if bayonetta has bad production team that doesn t pay people  would you stop playing the game altogether  in my opinion  i do not give a sh t because i m not a social justice warrior. it s company s problem and employees have their ways to deal with it. they don t care if you help them or not. all they want is justice in any way  even if they are helped. i was one of these employees  i would see getting a help as a  benefit  i can take an advantage of. everyone sees a help as an advantage not  support.  that s what all companies do whether if they are woke or anti-woke. i take their contents as long as i like them. if these companies shuts down  i wouldn t care too.
actually they do have a life  they re just tired of you people harassing them  assaulting them  and killing them just for existing
i agree to a certain extent  but i disagree. if you are expanding on a character s backstory and they are an important character in the show  i m all for it. what really irritated me was the fact that we had to get a backstory of characters where we really didn t need it. i didn t see the recent episode but im referring to bill and frank
thanks melanie for speaking so plainly about the christian perspective and the effect sin has on society. as a christian i saw where society was heading years ago. may god bless you and protect you young lady.
the episode  like the other filler episode  was slow and boring. that story could have been told in a quarter of the time to see how she got bit then moved on. instead  it was dull  slow  and the whole time watching it you had the question of  when will we get back to the good story  it was also so transparent what this  story  was going to show. i knew from jump street they were going to kiss  this was how she gets bit  and this other person is gonna die due to them being so dumb and assuming no infected are around. that someone who hasn t played the game could come up with all that in 10 minutes of this episode  illustrates that you didn t need to run this story for this whole episode. i don t care that they have gay or trans characters  i care that they have boring easy to predict episodes like this one.
two episodes of precious time...wasted on needless filler.we want the joel and ellie show  and a focus on their path  like in the game.they just need to get on with telling the story  and less sideways motion to explore relationships that we did not tune in to see.love you  by the way !
don t like it  don t watch buy it.  doesn t have a very good track record.  battlefield 5  g4tv  magic 30...  i m sure there are others i m forgetting...
my favorite show growing up was fresh prince of bel air. never did i think about how i don t look like them and my skin color is different. this whole  representation  thing is just an excuse
lol i did that exactly after episode 2. the shows over rated as hell.
because i love me some apocalyptic subject matter  i watched it.  the first  filler  episode  i was not happy with because it was a filler episode  that didn t move bill s story  or the main story along.  it was forced in.  granted  in a world with human kind drastically reduced  and so many gay characters  left from 10 percent of the original population  is hard to logically believe.  but  now there is a second wasted episode that infinitesimally moves the series story line along  may be it for me.  the only plot narrative from it is helping to understand why ellie is so frantic to save wounded joel  another person she cared for  she might be losing.
i m honestly of two minds when it comes to this topic. on one hand  i m all for gay transgender representation in media when done right  ala the original last of us video game  because in my opinion that s how you do it subtly and if it must be at the forefront  the character should at least have a likable personality  relatable ambitions and not have their sexuality or gender identity define their character as a whole. as someone who played the original game  i actually found the romance between ellie and riley to be really well written and charming  and i didn t even realize bill was gay until years later.i get what storm is trying to say  but much like with most actors nowadays  they guise their words to sound inclusive  but are just doing it for themselves  the attention and the retweets. if the show didn t do well  she and others like her would use the  you re just a bigot  card and silence all criticism under that umbrella and i ve stopped trying to reason with belligerent types like them.i genuinely don t care if someone looks exactly like me or has my orientation  i care more about the storytelling  character writing and conflicts the character face over who they want to sleep with at the end of the day.i don t think being gay or transgender is a sin  as someone who grew up in a religious household and has seen intolerance from a lot of adults in my life  i believe people should be allowed to live how they choose  so long as they aren t harming themselves or other people in the process. that s probably the most i disagree with melonie on  but that s what i love about discourse  we are allowed to throw our ideas back and forth until we reach a consensus  frankly it s become a lost art at this point in time.
this episode was sweet and heartbreaking. people that think like you are so cynical and obnoxious. the actress is right. don t like it  don t watch it. do something more productive than whine about something so inconsequential.
why don t you just watch it and judge for yourself  you re always looking for a reason to hate. it is not at all filler  they are adapting the very well received dlc. i understand you just want to see a good story and that s exactly what this episode does  and it tied directly into what is happening with ellie and joel in the present.and you say bill s episode was pandering when you admit you didn t even watch it.
oh and atomic hearts is awesome so that makes me pro putin  omg xd
no offense  but if you only watched one episode  then why are you still covering this  anything for clicks i guess. you re also pandering yourself out for content here as well ngl. disappointing to see how you can comment on something that you have no knowledge on since you don t watch it.
one of the best scenes in braveheart has a gay character. he gets thrown out the window it s hilarious and i loved it
i checked out midway through episode 3  not because i have a problem with gay people  but because i wasn t interested in watching a highly detailed gay romance in a post-apocalyptic thriller. i would ve had a similar feeling with a straight romance taking over an entire episode. it s just annoying to me.
they gave you a free pc  damn you are one lucky son of a b....
why is anybody watching adaptations of anything  is your addiction to content and brand loyalty so strong that you need to see more and more of every story you ve ever seen
all filler  no killer.
i love it when you talk about the bible. and i ve seen over the last year your growth in your spiritual life  the word  and with god. love it. i pray that you keep growth and learning and sharing. i really can t express how much i love seeing and hear you how much you ve grown. and may god continue to bless you melonie
you don t know what a  demon  was originally though. the memory of your grandpa as a guiding spirit is a daimon or daemon. it never meant anything  evil  until christianity tore down all the statues in ancient cities  killed a bunch of people  and forced people to convert to their religion.
you ve obviously never played the video game
@daury davis  no  and even if i had  i m watching a tv show not playing a game where likely i can press space to bypass boring predictable dialog and irrelevant story so i can get on with it. these two episodes were boring and drawn out  and worst of all for the second  100  predictable to someone who hasn t played even played the games. i knew what was going to happen less than 10 minutes into the episode and what would be  revealed  and frankly  if these two scenes are like this in the video game  i d have the same criticism of them in the game. don t care one way or another the sexuality of the characters  i do care that i had to be bored through  two episodes of the show where basically nothing happened. oh wait  one thing happened in the second one  ellie apparently had to recall that entire event in her past to realize at the very end that maybe she should search the house for some medical supplies to try to help him which  you know  is something someone who lived to her age in that world where everything has to be scavenged to survive  would know like abc and 123.
@anthony becker  wow you re a hypocrite
@daury davis  i don t think that word means what you think it means.
@anthony becker  should never whine about a show you obviously never heard of  but people like you love to cry about things that are above your understanding
@daury davis  funny  because i state i didn t play the games not that i don t watch the show. this is easy to discern since  how can i have known what was going to happen in an episode less than 10 minutes into it  unless i was watching it  how can i state two episodes were boring to me  unless i was watching both those episodes  and the others to single those out  perhaps you should understand what you re responding to before replying.
so you never played the dlc
not god s law so they can in fact do so
overrated
@daury davis  i did play the game 3x. the show didn t really live up to the game and i honestly didn t expect it to. but ya the casting is just not right in the show it s not giving me the vibes of the game. it might be copying scene for scene on a lot of things but they don t carry the same impact because the acting is not good enough. i ve watched some of the later scenes and they really don t hold a candle to the game either. you would need leonardo dicaprio acting to pull it off as good in the show as the game. the whole thing just feels dry and bland to it s hard to keep interested i notice with most hbo shows they are a very slow burn. sometimes they pull it off like with chernobyl other times they don t. the show would ve really benefited from some more action to break up the emotional scenes also more infected. it s nowhere near as good as what people are saying though a 10 is a stretch.
the bible says not to mark your body and treat it like a trmple. yet she s covered in tacky tattoos. can t just envoke the bible when it is convenient.
i don t think i would call this episode a  filler episode  considering that event does actually happen in the game unlike the earlier bill episode which was clearly a filler episode.
the sound on your videos are kinda low. for this one yt says -14.0db. i could turn up my volume. then i get blasted when an ad pops up. i could turn on my ad-blocker. but then you don t get paid.
my little cousin use to love playing with his mother s pocketbook and high heels. so much to the point where people would wonder if he was indeed showing signs of being gay. the mother just knew that wasn t the case and that was that. now  he s a 6  2  chad and girls literally throw themselves at him. he s a literal model and couldn t be more heterosexual. he s actually dating some extremely rich bombshell. anyway  imagine if that was today. ironically  his sisters have been brainwashed in college and it has jaded his mother significantly. if she was any other way  he might be trans right now. or  if it was happening today as opposed to a few years ago.
guess she ain t watching season 2 cause that shit gonna have gay
i enjoy speaking about and discussing biblical truth  but most do not have the courage to tell the truth anymore.  thank you so much for having that courage as it is sad how few get to hear it  and usually only hear the world s twisted view of it.i really enjoyed the last of us story from the game  because of the father and daughter relationship.  a really well told story.  with seeing where it went after the original release  i did not have any interest in seeing this show knowing they would likely do something like this.  so  i just waited to listen to you and others on what it ended up being.there is a movie coming out in april that i am looking forward to seeing.  it looks from the trailer like it could really be good.  it is darker  but based on a christian worldview.  it is called nefarious  maybe check it out.god bless you and keep you safe.
amen i agree  i m a minister myself with my youtube channel god bless you it s nice to see you preach online i wish to see more of it in jesus christ mighty name
ellie s inclination never bothered me in the dlc. it ran alongside and nobody was interested at all. then she likes girls. so what  but it was foreseeable that these mentally ill people from the film industry would now make such a fuss.
wait i don t get it. is she triggered that ellie is gay  cause that s canon..
didn t watch it  but if you ve played the game  this is all filler so it shouldn t matter either way. being mad at the 3rd ep. for being gay doesn t seem reasonable. being mad because they changed the story or because you didn t like the character to begin w  makes much more sense. but i don t understand being upset at the dlc ep. at all  if it was even remotely faithful. half of its story was flashbacks but the other half was how she managed to keep joel alive   it was a very important story  but it hits much harder if you have the full context of the 1st game before the  dlc .
the cutest couple ever  until the ending sadly
omg twd have gay chars that were bad ass i didmt complain cause they were part of the story
it takes guts to preach openly like this. i congratulate you
i really don t know why actors comment on their work in any way. that always confused me. you would think by now contracts would contain a clause that prevent them from doing so.on the representation front  it is important to a degree.when i designed characters in my first career...i learned a disturbing truth about myself. when it was time to design black characters  i had the damnedest time coming up with cool designs as heroes. i would look for other characters for inspiration  and it was all trash or stereotyped.i realized that i was having a hard time because all my life the heroes that i saw were caucasian  or japanese to the degree that black characters just weren t cool to me...the issue is...i m black...no smoke  just a bit of food for thought.
i like your content but the episode is an almost 1-for-1 reproduction of the relevant portion of the game. if you ve played the game then you know this part of the story and i don t understand why it would be upsetting from a   woke agenda  standpoint. in part 2 of the game  there is a little girl with a shaved head who claims to identify as a boy. it basically gets mentioned once to explain why her family is pissed at her and then dropped. will that also be objectionable whenever we make it there next season  what about dina  from tlou2  is that going to be a problem
zombie fatigue.
great point melonie  even as someone who had no interest in the game or show  knew that ellie was gay. and that game was so successful that it spawned a sequel and a freaking tv show. the phobic argument is so lame and tired. but that s all these fools in hollywood know!   ffs
im starting to feel w all the woke crap going on. we lose sight on shows that are actually good. i played the games n from what ppl said. i didn t watch the show. the other day  i decided to watch it n glad i did. could it be better  yea  but anything could be better. i can care less if ppl are gay but i wasn t happy seeing the two dudes n their first scene. cuz i m one if i dont like it i m not gunna watch. but their relationship was honestly beautiful n i balled my eyes out w those two. to me  love is love. they aint changing who they are they love themselves n also love whomever they are attracted too. sorry  but i see more beauty in what those two dudes shared than what i actually see in the real world.  most ppl are ruthless and don t really care. so i m actually enjoying this show for what it is. was that last episode not as good  yea  but they all can t be great  but i m sure it was great for someone. just think alot of us just need to shut up. not every opinion matters. their was so much hate when a certain person died in the second game. have they ever watched scream 2 when randy died ! ! it happens n feel w today having internet ppl just feel they need to speak when at the end of the day none of this crap really matters n we need to remember that.
i mean it was part of the base material but it wasnt a major part of the story to warrant a whole episode for. they want to make sure there is no doubt ellie is a lesbian  because you know....everyone is curious of the sexuality of a 14 year old.
i saw this episode. i found it to be the worst and most boring episode out of the entire series. the one with frank and bill at least had some good writing to it. this i found long drawn out and really added nothing to the story. the most interesting person in it was the fedra captain and bully girl who had a minute of screen time. ellie s girlfriend and the actress to me was one of the weakest characters and acted people in there. would have been more impactful if she stayed a reference and left mystery.
you shouldn t base a movies narrative one the few that want   representation  then obviously the many will not be impressed or entertained . i never watched men in black  blade   spawn   all the kung fu movies i ve seen  played all the non white characters in games i ve played   watched or played female characters etc and thought   you know this could really use my representation  . when we were kids we d fantasize being ppwer rangers. me and my black friend would play with other people and you didn t choose a power ranger based off skin color. i liked the red one but also liked the black one over the blue and he liked the green ranger.
it wasn t filler. next.
poor homophobe
yep
@lingr icen  my  oh my  i don t recall a time in which i made such brazen mistake in  the english language   my favourite of  all the languages!!! so  i shall correct myself. @meloniemac  i congratulate you also on the fandom you have  as they like to keep the comment section...clean...
why  practically everybody here is agreeing with her.
@peer165  exactly!!! i am congratuling her on her courage to do so  since i don t know many who do so openly  risking their career. i am  in portugal and since everybody wants to be so cosmopolitan   old values and moral are disdained and frowned upon  especially by the younger generations. here  they would call her a nun and would point her to the nearest monastery  all the while laughing at her. portugal is ashamed of its traditional roots. all they believe here is luck and connections. that s why i find her streams so refreshing.
then why is melonie complaining lol  she literally complained the dlc was filler
i don t get the representation stuff either.  she says we need to   get used to it.   for me i have to have some understanding in the story to enjoy it.  i can understand how gay people may enjoy the story of a gay couple because they can relate to it.  i can not relate to it.  i have never felt romantic love to someone of the same sex before and therefore can not relate.  some would say that my argument doesn t make sense because since i have never been to prison how can i relate to the story of my favorite movie   the shawshank redemption.   i can relate to stories like that still because it s is a story that starts with an innocent man being told he s guilty despite his explanation to the opposite.  i can relate to being told i did something that i did not do and not being believed when i can prove i didn t. now it was to the extreme of shawshank  but there is a relationship there.  there is no relationship for me in a homosexual story.
i don t support people who hate me
kind of weird your judging a show and actress when you re not even watching the material. are you just parroting what a small group of people are saying  and if so  why  genuinely asking because i like watching your content but this one seems below board.
personally  watched the series so far  its not great but it does tell the story of the game pretty well but does seem rushed and misses alot of stuff about the character. if honest  little disappointed that you only see clickers once so far  if you dont count the random ones in a crowd...
the dlc was pretty much filler look i hate how they castrated bill  and maybe this episode is the same  but the original left behind dlc was not filler in any way. between that  and you calling her  ella  it seems like you never actually played the game and are just repeating something you read.
you really need a lesson on critical analysis on film and television
the part that bothers me about this is  idgaf about your religion or your views  religious people are often the worst sinners.. take it from me  i know from experience.. i do think it s silly to have 2 filler episodes that did seem to drag on .. but that s not to say the content bothers me cuz i let ppl be whoever they want.
season 2 bout to be even worse lol
don t want fans  won t get them   more like.
the thing is though  to the people who wrote the bible   abomination  doesn t mean a horrifying  evil something  you can just look at the thing called abomination  and the things that aren t.  abomination  just meant  ritually wrong   it s not particularly a big deal.
to be fair  this was the entire dlc for the game so there was kind of a reason for it to be there. the issue is that this is now 2 episodes of almost the exact same thing out of a 9-episode series. thats a lot. they could have made this entire episode as flash backs throughout the series  and as good as the bill and frank episode was  it could have been half an episode.
well i haven t watched any of it and i never will so i guess she should be happy
did you really think they d wait for season 2 to remind everyone that ellie is a lesbian  the all huwhite showrunners already retconned most of the first game  including race swaps  so they can pander. we all knew this was going to be a well done joke. and of course the love interest had to be bl. maximum woke points. now it s gotten so bad that even normies are getting annoyed. therefore  i welcome it. woke of us.
y all just label everything as  woke  you don t even know what it means
you cannot justify sin...period. thank you! we all sin  well all fall short  but we never justify it. when you justify sin  you practice wickedness.
the prequal game had kinda lesbian vibes no  don t see a reason to not include it in the show. especially as they push the male side in every show they can. the only problem i have with the over representation is just that  its over represented. there s a new show out now wolf pack  its bad don t watch it  there are 2 maybe 3 occasions of heterosexual  make out scenes   while there are 10  over done gay make out scenes. why  if we want people to accept gays etc  stop making it special. make it casual  make it normal. one question on transgenderism  10 or so years ago  there were males who  got off  wearing womens clothes underwear  it was a  kink  now they are just trans people  did the sexual aspect just stop  probably not  now they can dress up  get aroused  go into womens changing rooms etc
you have no clue what you re talking about. this plays a significant part in the plot  both revealing ellie s past and setting up for a big moment in the future  which anyone who played the games would know. but considering you re speaking on a show you haven t seen and clearly know little about  such bad takes aren t surprising.
unlucky brain
they are cutting out nearly all the action and suspense of the game in favor of more and more drama  it s actually becoming quite dull. i can t believe people are still gushing over this show.
the episode with ellie and riley is the left behind dlc.
because she doesn t have any opinion of her own and is the one  pandering  to a certain demographic for views lol
@luca  that s unfortunate. there should be people out there fighting to keep the extreme woke out of our media but not at the expense of being and extreme bigot or what ever the term for is for people who just complain about anything gay or race inclusive and etc. in there shows or what so. i wish everyone would just meet in the middle and stop bitching.
it s been confirmed that there ll be more infected in the second season
@daury davis  hope so  still rather play the game again to be honest lol
she s a grifter
this makes zero sense. fans of the game would definitely be fans of the show since it sticks so closely to the game. they were gay in the freaking game for fucks sake.
i m a huge fan of the game. i haven t watched any of this garbage. the dlc was filler and only made to make ellie gay. also  part 2 was hot steaming garbage
@ghost227  these people have no point lol.  the show is doing very well but pretending it s not and acting like the show has no fans i guess makes them feel big.  the only reason this video even exists is to feed off the clout of a popular show to begin with.  even melonie lost focus and after i came back with my coffee is on a random trans rant and bible sin.
@nick scarlato  totally agree. there s an entire online hate watching industry to this shit.  get woke go broke!  gets tons of views even if it s not remotely true. the show has done nothing but follow the game very well and added in some stuff that made everything better. everywhere but right wing circles this show is loved. so it s weird as hell seeing this show get tons of love everywhere and then stumble upon this video and be like what world do you live in
@ghost227  melonie s now talking about the sin of eating pizza.  i have no idea what i m watching at this point.
@nick scarlato  what the hell this can t be real. the only other video i clicked on was her complaining about the way. the girl nebula is standing in a photo and how it makes her look like a man and i m like wow. petty.
@ghost227  very petty.  i watched it too though.  so it got my click.  i think the actress herself handled the non-issue well.  i don t see how a poster required such a long video.
it may be an hbo show but there s still a budget
i was already not watching cause i m boycotting wb  but ok  that just makes me want to avoid wb even morealso  boycottwb
i was out as soon as i heard about the first gay-romance episode. lol back in the day  it was totally normal to cringe at romance in movies.  men were notorious for groaning during them... until romcoms which was like a subversive way to get men to watch romance for the comedy.  flash forward to today  if you don t want to watch romance or implied porn  you re  a bigot.  . facepalmlet s be more honest.  the people promoting these agendas are like jehovah s witnesses that won t leave your door even though you ve made it clear that you re not interested.  it s borderline harassment to find the silly new religion everywhere you look where it isn t wanted.  it feels like they are trying so hard to create backlash.newsflash   homosexuality doesn t sell to the average person and never will.  it s been promoted for over 3 decades all throughout media.  this isn t inclusion.  it s a silly wish fantasy.
this show is extremely popular so i don t think they have much to worry about regarding people not watching it.
you know not even heterosexual relationships never been shown that much on video games back then   but today gay relationships is dominating video games today
meta pc should be more careful about the content they sponsor. i wrote them about it  referencing this video.
...but the  gay filler  episode is significantly more entertaining and thoughtful than this...
i usually agree with her but this is the second time where i don t think what she s saying is really valid.the filler episode with bill and frank in the last of us was definitely very woke and unnecessary. however  the episode with ellie and the other girl  i forgot her name  wasn t really unnecessary because this is almost exactly what happened in the game and it didn t feel like they were trying to push people into watching some gay sh t. it felt natural and i didn t feel like i was watching anything woke. they just seemed like two best friends having fun with a bit of tension here and there which is a normal thing. at this point  you re kinda reaching.
kinda expected it tbh.  drukman has been pretty blunt about his intentions since the beginning.he s been on a tirade to bring lgbtqabc into video games ever since his promotion at naughty dog. one of the reasons i no longer care for naughty dog games or even media.he believes he s doing good by pushing gay agendas
people love to misconstrue how christians feel about the lgbt community. as a christian  i will not judge people who are doing what is against my religion. i will make it known i believe it is a sin and will even inform those who ask specifically about it. but  they are free to do what they want. i will treat them with respect and may even befriend them in some capacity.   shrugs
i couldn t finish the first
being an anti-sjw type in 2023 is cringe
i m not sure hating and dissing your customers is a good strategy.
for those of you that played the game  it shouldn t be a surprise that ellie and riley are gay characters. it s not like the writers of the show made her gay when she wasn t in the game. besides  ellie is one of the most well-written gay characters in all of media history. i understand the frustration with the constant insertion of sexuality in media  it annoys me too...but i agree with that actor  if you don t like it then don t watch.
but to be fair  the show is the best one right now  better than the game  not even close  but definitely the best show right now  and we all know that the game already was already gay  woke or whatever people call it  and i don t care  i only care of quality  but when someone forces something  whatever that might be  then that s not good  and i don t see that much on this show  because as i said  the game already had all this  so all of this is not new to me nor do i care. speaking of this episode itself  i didn t like it  just like i didn t like this dlc in the game  but bill s episode  that one i liked it. best
i ve been keeping up with the show only because im a huge fan of the game   the gay dude part i forwarded to the end and wasn t a fan   it was a useless episode  i preferred the game  this one i kinda didnt mknd because i knew what was going to happen because its part of the dlc but still wasnt a fan because they are real live  kids  in the game its fake and it supposed to drive the story forward  so i just roll my eyes on it.  but the show is not bad at all. aside from the skippable parts.it saddens me that nowadays that the  woke left liberals  have changed being tomboy to gay and admiration into gay in films and shows.
i did like the whole entirely of the episodes of the last of us tv show series bc i was wanting to see how it was different than the video game series and how the video game director was making the show different than the video game series with the different characters in the show then in the video game series. also i do not like how two women are kissing each other bc in the bible it says that god doesn t like having two women fall in love with each other and how god loves to have a man and woman to be together to love each other than women and women to fall in love with each other  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to let you know what i think about this topic of the video for today  ok melonie. anyway also i just want to tell you that i went to see the movie called cocaine bear last nite  tuesday  and i just wanted to tell you that it was mostly funny but stupid movie that i ever heard of and saw in my life. anyway i hope you enjoyed the movie with your mother on friday and i hope you will share your thoughts bout the movie on twitter after you see the movie with your mom on friday  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today   hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
yeah. and just when eliie and joel were bonding and it finishes on a cliffhanger of him being stabbed in the gut  they switch to this and much earlier when she briefly mentioned how she got bit  omits entirely that she lost her girlfriend as a result of being at the mall. something she could of related to joel with about his loss. instead she yelled at him because he went quiet  it was all about her .it s jarring and unfocused for sure to install this late in the game. a breif flashback much earlier to explain how she was bit  would of been enough.
it s less about the gay and more about the filler. it s season 1  you shouldn t need filler this early. they are getting dangerously close to me not watching.1 was forgivable  now it s 2   a little bit peeved  3 will be a third strike.
odd response. this particular episode i understand was a dlc add on that has been around for years. it s not  filler . it explains how ellie got infected. the kiss is so minor who cares. i assume you think sam being deaf is stupid too
the creators decide what the story is  wtf. it s like saying jack and rose s romantic plot on titanic is filler and pandering  i came to watch a ship sink and these two had nothing to do with the sinking  titanic sinks with or without them  are we telling the story of the ship or are we telling a romance  like you good people i believe it can only be one.    no  the actress didn t say all are homophobes  she was addressing the ones that were homophobic  go read the imdb and metacritic 1-star reviews  you ll need a shower afterwards.
what s got you boycotting wb  not asking to be a bastard  i really want to know!
@the cooler vergil  firing henry cavill  treating directors like crap and interfering with there visions  and protecting abusers like james gunn  amber heard  and ezra miller. i was hoping after batgirl was canceled and henry cavil being brought back was them trying to turn the ship around and they would start to listen to the fans  but nope  wb just won t change. and i m just done with them  nothing they make can win me back  well except the ayer cut for suicide squad but that will most likely never happen and if it did i would just go back to boycotting them after i would see it
@meme guy  oh so the usual wb nonsense then  for a minute there i thought you were going to say they did something else horrible  i totally get you. also yes   releasetheayercut
cry
@sewer rat  for what
as long as you don t attack them verbally or physically  they don t mind
they re only dissing the homophobes  the fans of the game are loving it
it s not the gamers that are complaining though  it s the non gamers who are complaining
and the dlc was trash.
@first last  so just a prejudiced person who judges others different from yourself  so juvenile
@gail seaton humbert  everybody judges someone different than themselves - you re doing it now.  juvenile . yes  shoehorning in some teenage romance for a game taking itself as seriously as tlou did is embarrassingly bad writing. not surprising since naughty dog has been hiring failed hollywood screenwriters for a while now. heck even the end of tlou is lame  some girl who would never shut up about her thoughts throughout the game suddenly lays it on the protagonist that she had a suicide pact she made with a chick that finger banged her  talk about juvenile.
i can t imagine how hard life must be for people who get offended by this shit. adaptations aren t going to be perfect  because of the people involved. calling background episodes that contribute to understanding character development  filler  is a stretch  and just represents a viewer s ignorance.this show is going to be around for a while. if they speedrun everything it ll devolve into the witcher.
i agree the bill frank relationship ep was 100  forced like crazy but this ep is actually true to the dlc they cut out somestuff of course bc it would be too long but this is almost exactly how it happened in the game i hate wen they stuff woke shit into media too but this shit  besides the bill and frank shit tf was that lol  is just cannon to the game lmao now my reason for disliking this ep is bc it was boring af they focused the whole ep on it not bc their gay  they ve been gay since 2013
i never understood the need for representation.. some of my favorite games feature main characters that do not represent me. i don t know about you but whenever i get a custom character  creating myself never even comes to mind.
fr.   father
for those who are un-informed  ele is in fact lesbian  or bi-sexual  she falls in love with a girl in the 2nd game named dina  not some dlc  dina and riley are different chars. so expect more to be in there given how true they are staying to the source material. edit  it seems alot of people have not played last of us 2  or even taken the liberty to research it.
i wish they made a show on video game the last of us. it d be fun  no
this may be an unpopular opinion here but saying this was an irrelevant filler episode is ignorant of the game. left behind was portrayed accurately by the cast and showed the audience how ellie found out she was immune. not everything that merely shows a gay person is woke trash
i love how you make a video just to make a fool of yourself  you don t even watch it.
i ve come to the realisation that when my colleague says  have you caught up with this episode  because it is really good!   what he s actually saying is   this episode is oscar-baiting liberal-cuck nonsense and i know how much you hate that  so i m going to make you watch it...
i something needs to be normalized ... than it isnt normal
if you don t like it don t watch it  says the crowd constantly demanding changes to things they don t like.also how can you go from  we shouldn t care about who people love  to  people are gonna love it cuz representation  in the same paragraph without seeing the contradiction
my problem with this is the person writing it was trying to write a compelling story  and the actual reality or physics of it  never crossed their mind.you can cite all kinds of reasons  but historically  after a massive major depopulation event  humans tend to become very determined  strong-willed  spiritual or religious  and very  very moral  of course they would  otherwise  they d die. couple that with a species extinction-level-event  and homosexuality is not only ridiculous  it would endanger the future of all mankind. nature itself would drive us to procreate  possibly causing some male domination of women  if women themselves  didn t start going all coo-coo for coco-buffs.having said that  if the author of this work wanted this to be the story  then decide if this is your kind of story or not. i already don t watch it  read it  or play the game  because there is no good or new way  to tell a zombie story  and this one isn t even original or different  it s just sort of hopeless and dismal.tbh  i don t care for movies with a lot of psa  i can see sex and intimacy  anytime  i watch to see a good story  not soft-core porn. i don t care if it is hetero or homo  it s like we used to say   get a room!  there is a time and place for everything  if the average movie goer is so horny they need sex in everything they see  hear and do  they need more than a few seconds of suggestive touching is going to give them. maybe they should masturbate before going to the movies  and they wouldn t need all that.
i thought before you could dislike something you actually needed to eat it first we already made the sacrifice to eat the chapter. it behooves them now to eat our criticism.
idk if i can watch you after this i m sorry it was in the game literally i can agree ep 3 was filler and could have cut back and forth  but what thefuck ever but this episode is literally an integral part into who ellie is and it is indeed in the game so yes it is homophobic backlash
i may be atheist who believe in evolution  but girl i gotta agree with almost everything you say about the woke culture   all these messed up shit. as a new viewer   new subscriber to you i really like that you aren t afraid to speak your own mind   beliefs   not sugarcoat   trying to please everyone like most influencers.you honestly are like breath of fresh air to me with your thinking! keep going strong   wish you the best girl!
art  stories  culture and everything is a reflection to represent the values we would hold in high esteem and pride and hope to aspire. not just image alone. not just be devil then point and shout why they arent typically represented as angels and fairy princesses by some. they can be gluttonous polygamists etc all they choose  life is all about choice  just own it then. make your own stories glorifying. many other cultures to identify with and adamantly reflect your own values. but all this hijacking of western civilization and traditional european heritage is ridiculous. even in just the past few years. just wash it all away in flood of blatant deviance   then try cry victims of discernment. worst form of inequality is to equate unequal things as equal. respect for truth is closest people come to having a moral compass. good or bad is just an aesthetic apparently. but only truth remains. fake crocodile smilers to disappear like a fog when the wind redirects. not instant besties just for enjoying bacon and giggles and snuggles under the blanket get real.
filler yet this was in the game   they followed that part of the game perfectly i think my favorite part of this episode is that it s showing who played the game   who didn t i really don t get the point of preaching what the bible says
there was a so called writer who said don t like my politics don t buy my book. we haven t heard from her sense. it s almost like the whole don t watch or buy my product isn t a good marketing strategy. that s funny because the only ppl obsessed with ones race gender and sexuality are the ppl they re pandering to.
i didn t mind this episode. it wasn t so much about the gay lesbian stuff as the 3rd episode was. it was just 1 scene as it was in the game. i m loving the show.still think the actress shouldn t have said that  tho
my criticism of this show is the lack of violence and action scenes. specially coming from a studio like hbo.
it was filler -- that s why it was dlc.not needed to tell the main story.
you aren t a big fan of tlou are you  lol... bill and frank are gay in the game too. that is most certainly canon.
@schneed  it s very obvious in the game but frank leaves mad at bill but they completely changed that so yes i am a big fan lol
@schneed  you obviously didn t read everything i said lol
@schneed  this is true  but frank is dead in the game  and bill becomes a loner.
@fys mike  plus the ellie and bill interaction was the main highlight in the game and they never even met in the show  that s what generate the hate. episode 7 basically the game. these criticisms are super weird af.
only the dlc.. they butchered part 1.
it appears to me that a bunch of people haven t played part 2 of the game and don t care for the source material. at this point i m kind of tired of seeing ppl flame this show for nothing. i don t care for woke crap either but this episode is in no way filler. it may be boring but not filler. i think before other start speaking up they should actually watch the show and play the game to see why this actually makes sense to have this whole episode like this. i digress. season 2 is gonna make even more ppl mad cuz they are phobic
may be source material but the person who played her girlfriend was dry and boring. there isn t anything to make the viewers to care about her. bully girl has more of a impact and level of acting than her and she had like 5 seconds of screen time.
@ballistic t gaming  i played the last of us and again they ruined bill s character..
@ballistic t gaming  don t care but defending it..
@patrick henry  you have not played the second game i m guessing.
@perin molitor  dina is dry and boring  this isn t dina. play the second game.
@carolyn janes  i did and the actress who played her and even the character was. for frank and bill you could feel enough to where gay or straight you would be like these guys are cool enough to sit down and have a beer with. the girl here on the other hand was annoying and boring. the actress and character as a whole were just bad. what makes a character impactful is where you can capture the audiences who were fans of the game and who never heard of it to make them interested in the game. she offered none. the little deaf boy in the previous episode did a far better job than her.
@perin molitor  actually the vast majority of fans like dina  but you are entitled to your opinion. i still think you are confusing dina and riley as the same people for some reason though.
@carolyn janes  no. the dlc was garbage enough. i watched a playthrough up to the silly joel-in-one scene. it was soo over the top ridiculous. also why i haven t watched a single episode of this garbage ass show. now i make sure people are better informed before wasting time and money on this bait and switch garbage
@crystalx oof  they absolutely ruined my boy bill.  turned him into a gay stereotype and took everything that made him a badass away from him and then made him take the cowardly way out. infuriating.
@patrick henry  the viewership and ratings are pretty high for the show  you re entitled to your opinion though lol.
@carolyn janes  oh yeah. no chance of them lying about numbers! nope. no  fortification  here!
@patrick henry  exactly.
@patrick henry  so every source historically used to review monitor film show viewership is now just lying  imdb is lying about how people feel in regards to show  do you even know what imdb is or how it actually works  i hate to break it to you  but the show has been a great success that is just a fact.
@crystalx oof  more like a silly conspiracy theory dethatched from reality lol
@carolyn janes  why do you feel the need to put words in my mouth  yes  imdb has lied and will lie. call me whatever names you want. attack my character.  i dont care.you re going to need some new material.  that crap doesn t work anymore.
@patrick henry  i mean if you just say random conspiracy nonsense with no facts or proof to back your argument yeah people are gona call you a conspiracy theorist when you bring zero evidence to the discussion. anyway i can see you are in some pain  so i ll let you have the last word    have a good day
@carolyn janes  yeah. rangs of powa was the greatest show of all time! just ask imdb! lol yep. you should run along if that s the best you can do  sweetie.  you also have a nice day
it s an unpopular opinion in these echo champers of these types of youtubers but the fast majority of audiences are enjoying this show.
yeah 90  of people here didn t even play the game.
how is that a contradiction actually
behooves   why have i never heard that before
alice curico  i may be an atheist  but i don t a have problem with any person s religion or beliefs. just what helps you go through life ig.
of course they did. they ll certainly keep all the woke crap. we all knew this already
@patrick henry  having lesbians in something don t mean it s woke
@patrick henry  lesbians exist  believe it or not. if you don t like that  then maybe you should move to mars
yet  the bill episode wasn t in the game   the whole episode was a waste of time even if it was a straight couple.
shows the shills mostly.
@crystalx oof  i think it was a great addition to his character since we didn t know what happened with him and his partner. so i m happy they gave him screen time. however  what i said is fairly objective. so it s fine if you disagree. i thought it was a improvement personally. hopefully they improve part 2 because the 2nd last of us was horrible.
@gooddoggo  weak strawman is weak. and you even edited that
@astrocyborg  i never said it did.
@crystalx oof  but bill was also gay in the game the show just allowed him to have character development where he didn t get that in the game
@patrick henry  yeah i have to make sure my comments can be readable. so that s why i edited it. god forbid i try to elaborate more or perhaps even correct spelling mistakes. i think you should also start editing your comments. re-reading them could help you realize that you should make better ones
@gooddoggo  honestly at the end of the day   the first game will always be better then the tv show season 1
@astrocyborg  but got rid of his badass moments with elle and joel plus bill is alive that means   they could ve expand his story more and give him more development.... instead of killing him off
@astrocyborg  actually bill isn t even gay in the show because he literally say s he slept with woman before.  so basically he s bisexual
@crystalx oof  ehh i think some things were definitely better then what the game did. the intro showing subtle hints of what was to come. you got to see sarah s character a lot more. you had a lot more time with marlene and you got to see how the military was oppressive and thus showing why the fireflies were founded.  the only things i didn t like is that tess died differently  and ellie found out about sam s bite. i think it being a surprise would drive home like in the first game more of the sense of hopelessness you get throughout the games and in the tv series.
@gooddoggo  i don t like the fact they made sam deaf  don t like the race swapping   don t like the fact they made tommy s wife pregnant in season 1 because in the game  she wasn t pregnant at the time  she was pregnant in part2   didn t like the fact they toned down joel especially with the ambush scene   didn t like the fact they toned down the impale scene which ellie was a badass by the way while protecting joel  to me this isn t the best adaptation.plus getting rid of bill badass part when he saved joel and elle.again in the video game version   joel doesn t anxiety attacks compare to live action counterpart.
@gooddoggo  you failed.
@crystalx oof  sam being deaf had no effect on how his story played out. the race swapping of sarah  had no effect on how the story played out. especially because she is just killed off in the beginning of the game. plus joel is in his 50s it would be extremely unrealistic if he behaved as well as he did in the game. your other points are fair though so  fair enough.
@gooddoggo  everything doesn t have to be realistic   look at the walking dead and world war z and many zombies shows and movies before it..  plus again the last of us really didn t need a tv series because you can literally watch all the cut scenes basically a long movie.   calling this a masterpiece or beautiful  ain t it.  joel was more tougher especially his fists and bill wasn t just a gay character   he was badass in the game and a survivor   plus having traps around the city   it s really sad the show doesn t expand bills story and moments with joel and ellie   also ellie talks about bill in the last of us part 2 but now in the tv series.. they also tooked that out instead.
@crystalx oof  the last of us  goal was to be grounded in realism. plus this isn t wwz or the walking dead. why does it have to be like those tv shows  the reason why joel acted like he was superhuman is because they know that it would hurt the gameplay if he wasn t. this isn t a game though  it s a tv show. which is why they made the change. bill is badass  he isn t just gay. he literally defended his home and single handily killed a fuckton of raiders because of his traps. he was thriving at survival in the tv show. the moments with joel and ellie being with bill weren t even that interesting to begin with. you would move on without him anyway and learn nothing about him except for the fact that he is gay and a survivalist. i like that they showed more of his character and he wasn t a two dimensional character like he was in the first game. in the show you get to see that he is more then just a survivalist and gay. he s caring  dependable  charming  smart  and funny. we learned more about who he is as a person then we ever did in the game.
@crystalx oof  nailed it  my friend.  the game was a massively better story than the show.
@gooddoggo  you can t help but to strawman people   can you  or are you just too obtuse to understand what crystal is saying
@gooddoggo  bill had more depth of character in the game than he has in the show. they turned him into a gay stereotype  ie. one dimensional  they erased everything cool about him just to  trick people into watching a gay romance. those are the exact words of the director.you can t lie to people who played the game
she s only referring to the homophobes crying
@daury davis  don t think it makes them homophobes  tho
i m mildly disappointed that they left out some good action from the games  but that s truly my only criticism so far lmao. i enjoy the romance  i just wish it could go hand in hand with smore action
@squirrelbeez  right. where is all the stealth kill and make shift weapons  they even cut away from the head shots and up close kills.
@phil leotardo
i wasn t going to watch this anyway  i think i said as much on the last last of us video you made.  i wasn t really interested in this particular game series anyway  but honestly if this was their biggest selling point then why should i bother   it s a lousy and shameful sales tactic  make the show look like a victim because a particular minority is being attacked  then people who wouldn t normally watch the show or play the game or whatever will suddenly jump on and give money to whoever makes the product.  the sad thing is that it works  it s shameful money that sadly gets these things made again and again  it really is disappointing.as far as the other topic of sing goes  the scenario that came to my mind was that time when king david fell to the sin of adultery and then kept compounding that sin with more sin  eventually resulting in the murder of an innocent man.  it took the prophet nathan to confront him about his sin  and it s one of the most depressing stories if you think about it  but yeah that s what sin does.  it escalates into something worse  one small little thing behind closed doors can become something massive that gets out of control.  the act of sin may provide simple fleeting moments of pleasure  but those moments will never last and you ll always be hungry for more gratification  constantly chasing after that one moment of pleasure again and again blinds us from a much bigger picture of life that god has planned for us all!!!
someones never played the game....
anyone that had a backlash to the last episode clearly didn t play the game. they basically took the dlc left behind note for note. normally  i d roast the actor for it.  it wasn t filler. bill s story was filler. not only was this episode not filler  it was placed in the correct order of episodesmelanie has a garbage take this time around
episode 3 is an exception  because the story telling was great to back it up. this one was just blatantly preaching  there was almost no story  other than  muh representation . hbo max strikes again.
wait have you played the games  they were gay in the first game its not really anything to cry home about  i m sick of ideologies being shoved down our throats as much as the next guy  but if you came into this series not knowing this was going to be a thing  that s on you.its been part of the story since the first game ellie mentions her having a crush on a girl in fist game dialogue with joel cant remember where they had tons of dialogue options between them think its when she is talking about her life before meeting joel and then that is shown in left behind dlc that is a crucial to the story because it shows how she got bit and who bit her and why she is immune to the virus and is the cure and what she was doing before she met joel and it showed what her relationship with the girl was like and how it developed and how rileys death inmpacts ellie and plays apart into her character development by the time she meets joel. she is gay in the second one has a girl friend called dina everyone familar with the series knows that. so why is this being made a big thing about its no shock to anyone who has played the games or atleast has knowledge of the last of us series. ellie has been gay since the first game and who cares really its a no brainer they are gonna have it in a show called the last of the us that is an adaption of the gems caleld the last of us and so its a episode literally about left behind and the show will most likely addapt the second game too its a no brainer. the show has been highly successful even if i and so many think it was pointless and didnt need to happpen because the games were litterally already like a movie or tv show with how much story and cut scenes are actually in the games theres more more cut scenes than there is actual game play in both games  the 1st one more than the 2nd one if i remember correctly. she is right though dont get so offended or make the thing she said bigger that it actually was and make a 27 minute video about you complaining about it she is just literally stating something that is true dont like it dont watch it no one is forcing you to and tbh if you have a problem with it now wait until they addapt the second game and introduce dina. the actress is right in this case tbh  the show has actually been incredible addaption so far and finally broke the video game addaption curse for once. its probably due to this game being more like a movie than an actual game but it broke it which may be what was needed for other games to be successfully addapted im hoping for metal gear solid movie even though i think it would have worked better as a tv show with the first season focusing on metal gear 1 and metal gear 2 solid snake first but they seem to be making it a metal gear solid 1 shadow moses addaption because thats the most popular game in the franchise and fair enough missing halve the story of solid snake and what made him solid snake but hey it makes sense i get it.  metal gear solid would have worked really well if they made it like a 24 type show.  they ve been talking about making call of duty movie for years which will probably be really good anyway because military movies are easy to  make.
can t we just focus on one story being a good story it s 20-23 of course not everything needs to be woke for some reason
i didn t watch blade to feel represented  i didn t watch pulp fiction to feel represented  i didn t watch anything with jet li or jackie chan to feel represented  i didn t watch rush hour to feel represented and so on. if it sucks it sucks we wanted the last of us to show us action and killing zombies and joel and ellie s relationship
you don t like it don t watch it we all know how that ended
this one actually isn t filler unlike episode 3 . this one is straight from the game itself specifically the dlc  and it s all about ellie s backstory and why she has abandonment issues. but storm s claim that the backlash is  homophobic  is just stupid  since the fans of the game the people who are watching the show  already knew ellie was gay for years
man  there s a massive amount of shills defending this on every single channel that criticized and exposed the last of us for the woke garbage it is. thanks for not bending the knee like everyone else melanie mac! it s so refreshing to see a content creator who prefers respect over attention.
the homosexual part  well  it s in the game... so  they re faithful. the series up to part 7  interesting  sometimes thrilling .. i like it. but not amongst the best i ve seen. it s a ok good .
haven t seen the show  but i remember the dlc left behind  where ellie was a lesbian  too. in the last of us part 2  ellie transformed into a warriorlesbo. i am trying to say i prefer watching lesbians instead of two bearded papabears kissing each other
well this episode was entirely skippable. basically nothing helped us understand anything we didn t already know.
this one was easier for me than i thought it would be. i played the first game and i still love it even if it is essentially just another apocalypse story. i knew hbo would add a bunch of nonsense that insulted me and any beliefs i have  so i didn t watch. i hear it started out alright and just goes downhill from there.
i totally with you! i m sick of the pandering. i get that the original video game has drama in it. however  druckman   producers are using that to pander in the end. nobody wanted to see rope back mountain. we wanted bill the survivalist take out enemies all the while helping out ellie   joel. the episode with riley and ellie was meh at best and their attitudes didn t make it better. there s very little zombie action within the show. this needs to stop.
dont like it dont watch it     gotcha  offer accepted
we will all have different view points on sin. even as christians. but either christ saves or he doesn t. no1 can take away the bond between christ and those that love him. and that goes for all. it doesn t say  he who calleth my name ... except   there is no exceptions for those whom call him lord and have asked him into their life. sins are products of being  in sin    ie  unsaved   having not asked christ into their life. the best one can do is speak their own word of faith into being for those their heart reaches towards and more. whether it be in person  or a private prayer alone. it is not our place to judge what god is doing in someone s life. who are the clay to judge the potter. just how i see it. christ and god  s love in all things.
i love your videos but stephen is pronounced steven not stefen. its an old spelling of steven and a lot of people still use that as a sir name like stephens or a frist name like stephen.
this isn t even a filler episode  it s important to ellie s character. episode 3 is filler but not this.also you stopped watching the show because you didn t like it  you do realize your doing exactly what storm is saying to do right  so why are you complaining  she s just giving simple advice. you haven t seen the rest of show up to this point so why make videos about it. why do you even care
...it s false advertising...or bait-and-switch if those weren t the themes associated with the video-game...and the only reason they made a live-action remake is because of the game...and perhaps  because  the lead characters  were  straight...and the only reason people tuned in to the live-action tv show is  because  of the video-game...which the live-action tv show is unrepresentative of the very source-material it is based on...and what fans of the video-game expected...they were deceived by unsolicited  creative-license ...
sorry  i realize i wrote sing instead of sin at one point  accidental typo!!!
or they never played the dlc.ellie s sexuality is never mentioned in the game.
yessir. this episode def not filler. this was pulled directly from the game and it was boring but it was done right and i think it goes well with the story
the dlc was filler for the game. it was garbage just like part 2 was.
ngl  was looking for this comment. i agree fully.
yup and because this is a major show  the audience needs to see how ellie got bit. also  melonie recording a whole video without watching the episode first is kind ve annoying especially if she s already watching the show as is.
@ballistic t gaming  bill s episode nearly lost me. it was a wild departure from the game. definitely virtue signaling.  the rest of the episodes have been faithful enough to keep me watching until the part 2 stuff kicks off. then i ll most likely show myself out the door.
@nick amalfitano  they ruined bill. they turned him into a stereotype and took away everything made him cool. being gay had zero to do with it.
@patrick henry  and they also toned down joel because mostly everyone knows joel dies in season 2...
@patrick henry  we agree on the bill episode. anyone who played knew he was gay. i say that was a departure bc of the suicide  cuddle and the fact that we were robbed of all the snarky exchanges between bill and ellie. hell  bill and frank hated eachother at the end  in game . that wasnt bill  it was a dude that looked like bill in a virtue signaling script. that episode nearly lost me.the left behind episode wasn t that. and i d say that besides race swapping tommy s wife for more woke points the rest of the series  excluding bills episode  has been pretty darn good and very respectful of the in game canon
@nick amalfitano  yep. bill was a well written character in the game. the fact that we didn t know exactly what went down with frank was immensely better than strawberry fields and ghey piano sex.i never saw the dlc as anything other than a trope to make ellie gay for part 2. nothing in the first game hinted at it. i was out after that. i wasn t surprised when part 2 came out and we got the joel-in-one scene.  also why i haven t shown any support for the show either.  all roads lead to the ghey golf club gang and joel-in-one. why bother
@patrick henry  i ll show myself out the door when part 2 starts. till then  they ll have to make another terrible episode like bill s to make me exit earlier. i ll just memory hole the part 2 episodes like i did part 2 and pretend they don t exist. i too will not watch the golf simulator i can t agree with you on left behind. i found it to be a very good dlc.
@nick amalfitano  fair enough. it wasn t really written poorly or anything.. to me it was forced in to make ellie gay. how may other dlcs did we get  none.  why would i want to see gay romance of 14 yo children  it had no real purpose other than  ellie gay now
@nick amalfitano  oh! and  joel bad now
@patrick henry  the writers willl handle the dina and ellie  abby and androgynous kid that abby dragged around storylines with the subtlety of a sledge hammer hitting a finishing nail.
this episode was literally in the game
it was always gay and you don t know what woke means
that comment is just for you homophobes
she was referring to those who clearly never played the game
it was in the game
it didn t though silly  season 2 is coming
girl im not even 2 minutes into your video  but in the same breath you say how you haven t watched past the first episode  and yet make comments about how the gay episodes are filler   lol this show is doing a great job at replicating the source material  all the characters that are gay in the show were gay in the game -- which was released 10 years ago in 2013.
ellie was always gay. that s the source material. gamers already knew this would be coming. i m waiting for the show to shoehorn abby into season 1 somehow.
it s funny you call it history when it tries to do away with history and science!
i ve virtually given up on western tv movies  i watch 90  foreign now  mostly korean and other asian stuff  some european... i m not asian  i don t identify as asian and i don t need to  to be able to enjoy their shows and movies. to make a separate point  if you race or gender swapped  let s say  james bond or sherlock holmes with an asian guy or woman  i wouldn t be happy  and as we ve already established  it s not because of any prejudice against watching asian actors  but about breaking the continuity of a well established franchise. i wouldn t watch blade if they race swapped him for a white guy  god forbid that they d ever race swap a character in that direction.
i stopped watching after episode 3 and i m not looking back
ellie is gay in the video game. bill is never shown as being gay though.
they made ellie gay in the dlc. she was not gay in the original game.
they were gay in the game this is not a filler episode actually episode 3 was a filler episode. you didn t even watch the show i can tell
that s why i don t watch it!!
i hope the2 characters get to scissor b4 chick turns into a zombie
don t like it  pirate it.make it hurt some more.
imagine actually supporting a series which has a history of not only sexism but not paying their employees . could never support last of us ahaha
done.
what backlash  most reviews i ve seen were pretty positive on both the  lgblt  episodes.. and since when didn t ppl like seeing girls kiss girls   the only problem is everyone being overly sensitive and easily offended these days.. cry me a fkn river
the amount of people who will defend druckman and his overrated game and show is unreal.
they lured us in with game accurate dialog and story... and poof they lay on the gay. thanks neil druckman  we knew  you wouldnt let us down.
i love the games it s just the casting for the show sucks.
he talked about having a partner and in his truck there was a gay porn magazine that ellie finds
hahahaha. if you say so
lol she was in love with a guy in the original
you guys wanted an accurate representation of the game and you got it. this shows us ellies back story and doesnt ride on the fact she is gay  it has almost nothing to do with that. its just giving us a bit of exposition on ellie and revealing what made her the character she is. and as a christian i couldnt care less on the lgbt aspect of this. you guys just care too much
don t worry i haven t watched it and will continue to not watch it
you can t criticize and say that some people need validation from hollywood by seeing themselves and then whine about not seeing yourself in hollywood productions. the same people who say  race doesn t matter  also cry about a black tinkerbell. if race truly didn t matter  people wouldn t have complained about idris elba in thor i. the truth is that most of the most vocal audience is white and they want to see themselves on screen. i don t know why people can t be honest. you want a white tinkerbell. fine. i get it  but at least being honest about it there is a conversation to be had about making sure white people are also represented in films well. notice no one cares that wendy is white and the title character or captain hook is white and the main protagonist. instead the focus is on tinkerbell  a character that is a minor role but important. why isn t having 2 of the three main characters and many supporting characters all being white enough for the audience  and if tinkerbell was white and peter pan was white  the criticism would be  why is wendy in the title  why can t it just be peter pan alone  it s woke  if all the characters were white and it was called peter pan  this film would be ignored entirely because it looks generic. there is literally no winning  which is why filmmakers just do whatever they want.
the bible is pretty plain that if a country turns from god  god removes his blessings from that country. we re seeing that right now. look at the state of our country.
for all of you saying it was in the game so it wasn t filler..... it was woke crap filler in the game to!!
wow! melonie  i am so relieved to hear someone else describe the first episode of the hbo lou as overrated. i couldn t stand it. not only because of the race-swaps  or the in-your-face political jabs. the thing that got me the most pissed off  is that pedro pascal delivered a performance that was 1 100th the quality of troy baker as joel - and sure  the character models  and in-game graphics were well done. however  in my opinion   the only reason to warrant the creation of a video game adaptation that makes any sense  is if you can improve upon the original source material  while staying true to the aspects that made it great. hbo did none of that  and pascal was out-acted by a model designed from software  and troy baker s vo. i encourage folks to watch the ending to episode 1 side-by-side with the final moments before the title sequence in the game. the game did it infitinitely better in every way. excellent video  melonie! stay amazing!
tlous...why so much ghee
actor was already paid and made her money  the series continues to see increased viewership with every episode released. the people making the show have zero reason to care about what you and the rest of the bigots cry about. lol
romans 1 18-32 uses homosexuality as an example of the curses god allows to befall communities who not only reject him  but mock him and morality itself. essentially  he stops fighting for their soul and just lets them create greater and greater misery for themself. the more someone willfully allows sin to take hold  the more god allows it to swallow them and drag them deeper. according to that except  it is a first symptom of a spiritually diseased community or society.
i got no problem with people batting for the same team  but i also have no interest in seeing gay characters in shows or movies. especially because being  gay  are often those characters  only personality trait. a normal person does not base his or her entire existence off of sexual preference or identity.
don t like it don t watch it i m pretty sure you ve said that same thing except replace the watch with play instead of being about shows and movies you referring to video games i mean nothing wrong with the sentiment honestly if you re not enjoying something you shouldn t engage with it if you do you re kind of stupid it s different if it s something that has like a deep emotional attachment to you and the new version of its or whatever happens to not be great but you still trying to stick through it because you got hope it ll get better but in general if you don t enjoy something you probably should find something you actually do enjoy
if i said  don t like it don t shop here  at my job i would be fired
you seem like a decent girl  if i was younger you would be an ideal date - until we got to the religious part. i adhere to logic   reason and the morality that is derived from it - so far it trump s everything that takes  dedication to dogma  as religion does. you are the interpreter  literally a subjective perception of allegory  poetic lessons and cryptology. to say you even know the origin of the texts is a flat out lie since they were written and modified for well over 2000 years since their first publication. thinking knowing feeling - all different things  the best one of course knowing is an effort at best. science purports no 100  definite knowledge written in stone other than the things we seem to know for sure like birth  death  whatever you want to call gravity and the other natural elements that are basically irrefutable. religion starts with an unproven claim  the grandest of all and then must convince the subject that everything else around the claim is also true - just because  it is written  by people - dead people who cannot claim they were  inspired by god  since they lived thousands of years ago. so it s an entire ideology built on...oh i bet you said it in your head or out loud even  faith  and faith  no matter what you were told or believe is a guess about something that was told to the subject   with faith.   furthermore i know of no book with actual magical powers - to the point where  since i ve studied the human race for around 30  years i could most likely write an elaborate story  bury it in a tomb and theoretically someone could dig it up in a thousand years or more and think it too as well is divinely inspired. i respect you for being a decent person - but your ideas  like all the other faith guided people could be completely wrong and i m not living my life on the edge of pascal s wager because i m mentally enslaved by something that demands to be the gift of morality itself. my opinion is if there was a god it would simply be  creation  which is a thing that exists without needing worship or any other kind of approval. but think you need an all powerful nanny in your head all you want - i find what motivates people more than anything are actions like threats to their well-being instead of just stories  written words of damnation and promises of salvation through obedience. and the only thing i know of that gets off on being worshiped are disgusting human authoritarians. sadly it appears that simple minds need written affirmation to feel the same thing these woke clowns want  the established respect of their peers.   godsneedtoprovetheyexist
the characters were gay in the game  sure  but it wasn t so obvious  there were only hints that bill was gay  nothing like the show  which is pandering  yes  but i enjoyed the bill episode regardless . ellie was shown only in the dlc  which the last episode was based on   it felt too long as a whole episode...
did your parents not love you
back in 1995  the leaders of the church i belong to  the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints  wrote the family a proclaimtion to the world which describes why families are important and why it s important to to have healthy families. there were many things touched on that are controversial now such as teaching the importance of heterosexual marriage  importance of life even in the womb  and the importance of gender. this quote was their warning at the end of the document for those who disregard these truths  we warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity  who abuse spouse or offspring  or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before god. further  we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals  communities  and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.
hey melonie  just wanted to say as another follower of jesus who also loves to be a nerd  i really appreciate you standing up for god s word and not having to completely give up the things you enjoy to do so. your takes on these world views are so refreshing and it brings joy to me. awesome videos and i pray god continues to bless your channel as you keep glorifying his name! lets go!
done and done
hmmm...i thought the purpose of entertainment is to appeal to as many people as possible and make money. silly me. both the old and new testament speak to homosexuality and how serious a sin it is. an exorcist said one time that sodomy is one of the four sins that cry out to heaven for vengeance. he said that its so bad that demons leave as they don t want to even be present when the act is going on. serious stuff.
i don t watch it. problem solved
ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead  nor print or tattoo any marks upon you  i am the lord.  your a hypocrite
i didn t mind the episode because it s what the original material is  the story s from the dlc. what i didn t like was the third episode that was basically all filler and skipped a lot of great story from the game. don t get me wrong  i love the show  i think they did an amazing job.
say less
punctuation  bruh..
@patrick henry  i m not trying to be rude i do often forget the punctuation but do you have anything to say about the actual comment
@emily alucard garland  nobody does.
@emily alucard garland  i m not trying to be rude either  but i can t understand whatever it is you re trying to say.
melanie year older than i am so i m pretty sure you know for a fact that way before being lgbt was quote  mainstream if a boy played with barbies most people would assume he was gay that has nothing to do with the rise in lgbt people it s been that way for a long time it was like it when i was a kid so i know it was like that when you were too i m not saying i disagree with you that there has been an over glamorization of lgbt people but please don t stretch the truth to make your argument just use the truth
@adam  fair
@patrick henry  oh okay gotcha let me see if i can explain it a little better i m basically melanie made this video about her complaining that an actress for the last of us tv show said don t like it don t watch melanie is complaining about that but she herself has made the argument of don t like it don t watch it about different games and certain types of movies and products in the past  i was simply pointing that out and saying that in my opinion if you don t like something it s probably not worth it to keep watching  unless maybe in the case of say it s something you really like that got a remake or a reboot or a new incarnation of some kind and maybe it s not really living up to your expectations but you want to stick through with it to see if it gets better. i hope that was clearer and sorry about the lack of punctuation i use a speech-to-text program because i m legally blind and i often forget to go back in and put the commas and periods. anyways hope you have a great day
@emily alucard garland  well.. one comma is an improvement.. i guess. pro-tip  you can say the punctuation using vtt. also  you can enlarge the text on your screen.  i m also pretty blind so i have to enlarge the font size.
@patrick henry  yeah i have it at the largest setting it s still rough to read things especially when websites don t have a dark mode option
she s an actor she already got paid and she s in euphoria lmao she ll be fine
i ain t reading all that
@yung teddytot   i appreciate your honesty!
and never forget fam  the first thing the lgbtq movement co-oped for their messaging was god s promise to mankind to never flood the world again. the rainbow.
melonie is missing the point that gay characters were not the focus of the first game and thats part of the problem with this show. they are forcing their agenda on viewers and using bait   switch on people.
season 1 was better than i imagined -- but future seasons are going to have a got final season type calamity losing viewership.  druckmann s  1 goal in life is to normalize homosexuality and doing it with the youth seems to be a similar priority.  the success of the game shows few care about gay characters  but your word pandering is far more appropriate here.  they stretch belief with the odds having the majority of people be gay and worse  they have one guy reading a bible who is that 1 in a million scumbag.  they did the same thing in the early 2000 s when almost nobody cared about interracial marriage -- they had interracial dating   marriage in every show to the point that it was annoying that you could almost always predict who ended up with whom because of it...  but they overload their virtue signaling crap because they need it to bother you so they can claim they are superior to you  the fans.  it s a pathetic  and  as you say  pure narcissism.  the episode with the two girls you mention was one of the worst episodes with a ridiculous mall almost in shape you d find it today including an arcade with every machine running without dust piled up...  and the couple had at best very awkward chemistry and the whole scene looked forced -- but that might be bad acting.
yo  mel i support you but did you ever play the game. you don t watch the show yet you show your opinion if you played the game you would know that this episode isn t filler it is actually a key point to the story.
i already was expecting it to be lgbtq heavy  i just need this series to prove that the storyline from part 2 was trash by using a different storyline as the folks who say tlof2 is the greatest game of all time can get a reality check. tlof1 is a candidate but not part 2. hell naw.
quit watching films that have content you don t wish to watch....
i haven t watched this episode yet but i ve played the game and ellie and her friend are canonically lesbian so i m not sure what the problem is  i can see how the two gay guys can be an issue bc it wasn t in the game but from what i ve seen from the sneak peak this episode looks to be all canon
i respectfully disagree about your opinion of the show. i think it s great and even the  filler  episodes portray some great acting  character building  set pieces  and cinematography. i m a big fan and i m a against pushing woke agendas. i m a christian and everything else you hit on in this video is spot on. we re called to love everyone even if  inevitably  we disagree with them on something. great video!
cause you know they are so oppressed   that they are the oppressors
god  yall are weak. if you played the first game  you would have seen this comming. granted  episode 3 was definitely filler  it was still an interesting take on the character bill  and a deeper dive into his routines. the most recent episode was already in the  left behind  dlc. for an audience who hasn t played the game  it gave great background for ellie and how she got to where she is now. not to mention  societal norms   religious beliefs dont apply in the world of the last of us  its 20 years into a dystopian survival hellscape. it s not lqbt propaganda  its merely taking the key moments from the original source material  and tweaking the story slightly to better fit a broader  tv  audience. why do people judge a show without even watching it  just only spreads idiocracy.
the gay episodes are so boring bill s episode could ve been so good it was my favourite part of the game but so much was missing and this episode was even worse.but you can t say that because you ll be attacked by people saying you re homophobic without even reading or thinking about what you say .it s getting tiring
this entire commentary can be distilled down to one statement. if you do not believe in how the religious right agree with then you are evil and full of sin. acceptance of your neighbor and common man is the main underlying tennant of all religious teachings. we are all born with the god given right of choice. not everyones choices are the same which is a healthy thing and can open up dialogue to understand the reasons for an opposing view  but rather than trying to understand a differing point of view the fear of a new or different point of view ends up in gaslighting that anything that is different is evil is a pure example of hypocrisy.
not every actor needs to be a striaght white person. that being said  they should have cast a hotter ellie
so she didn t watch past the pilot but then watched when when a ton of reaction vids got a lot of views proves just how much of a money grab this is and i m done sorry not sorry i m not watching this reaction past the ridiculous remark oh and epi 7 was not filler it was actually dlc for the game and this epi really went with epi 8 to show how ellie as a character changes and why
you know  in a show about the extinction of the human race  they would focus more on repopulation  instead of sexual representation  but that s just me.
got problems with hogwart s legacy  don t like it  don t watch it! back atcha! honestly  the disingenuous behavior of these people is just gross...
honestly i don t think this is such a big deal tbh. it s a good show and the fact that some things are different from the game don t take anything from it other than what you would already know was gonna happen. i m not gonna get triggered over a gay kiss. this is an adult showplus  you don t get to  not want to ban gays  and simultaneously spread the idea that this will destroy our society if we don t do something about it humans aren t the only creatures with homossexual tendencies  you can look this up in less than a minutelook  it s pretty simple  if you re not willing to give the show a chance then just don t watch it. mind as well not watch anything else with stuff that the bible condemns like most movies and shows
people don t care that the characters are lgbt  they were queer in the game too. but they care that so much of the very limited runtime is being spent doing deep doves into gay romance  something even gays aren t interested in watching in their post-apocalyptic show. but i can t watch the series anyway. the actress they picked for ellie is terrible. she has none of the personality   gravitas that ashley brought to the role.
eh  i cannot watch this show.  so  let them do whatever they want to  or about  the show.  it won t affect me.
oddly enough  no one calls the completely needless practice of circumcision  mutilation. as for the bible  well  that collection of books is quite ok with things like slavery  subjugation of women and the stoning of people.also  if you believe some deity created humans  well  there are humans that are born with both female and male biology. do you think god made a mistake look  i m also not a fan of some of the woke stuff being pushed hard in some media  however  bringing god into this really isn t an argument.and no  one isn t born into sin. it s our actions that matter.
because ppl find ways to spread their hate or own beliefs onto others. does this not look like what the alphabet community is trying to do to us
@ballistic t gaming    no we aren t doing anything the other guy are doing it  is the equivalent of what you are sayng
@sub zero  i hear u bro but this goes both ways. i like melanie but she is reaching with this episode. it s not agenda focused like she is saying. episode 3 on the other hand was hollywood being hollywood putting their agenda front and center
@ballistic t gaming  they are gay even in the game  i agree that they kinda butchered their personality in the show for simplyfing the story  but still
@sub zero  ya personalities in this show are so watered down especially joel. but maybe they are doing that knowing that they have to kill him off in season 2
isn t that what walking dead is doing
@peer165  i don t know  i quit watching seasons ago.
that s a game not a film silly
i don t  and i don t.
i don t understand why everything must revolve around homosexual plotting in this series. i guess they are preparing the audience for season 2 s antagonist being transgender--as done in the second game.
this show is carried by the fact it was tied to a videogame  take that away  and it has just as many  if not more  flaws as all the other mediocre shows that keep coming out recently
bad move  storm
the fact that people call this show amazing shows just how low the standards have fallen.i played the game when it first came out and overall liked it  but not enough to care about the universe or anything. i don t see a reason to watch the show  yes it s cool to see some of the cutscenes get almost frame for frame reshoots in the show but at the same time i already saw all that 10 years ago.and yeah the gay stuff was in the game  so i expected it to be in the show  didn t care then  don t care now  at least one of the gay characters was decently written.
ok  i won t.
i love how you say  god made us and then sin entered the world  as if god didn t create the circumstances and concept of sin to begin with. ridiculous.
i don t care  personally  if a character is gay. if they re well written i will be just as invested in their story as any other character.the problem is not the gay characters. it s using them to pander and blackmailing the audience into watching or they re homophobic.and as for the sexuality representation  i m aro ace and i hardly  if ever  see any aro aces anywhere in media. i honestly don t care i just want well-written stories
i m really tired of this whole virtue signal of representation of race and sexuality being pushed down our throats. i just want a good story without having  the message  shoved down my throat.
the worse part is the actor who plays ellie is a christian so i imagine that would have been uncomfortable
stopped watching after episode 3 anyway so....   who tf cares   xd
i agree with most of your opinions about the show itself with the episodes being very much filler and not being important to the main story. but the christian rant you went on about maybe could ve been better worded  seems to me like you actually believe people born gay can actually become not gay and that them being gay is them simply  not chosing the right option  which is very ignorant  you preach about accepting people s lives but are also saying they re inherently bad it doesn t add up. even animals can be gay  it s been documented many times  it s natural  nothing to do with  demons .
the episode isn t filler as it s covering the left behind dlc as it s covering ellie s backstory.. and the homophobia makes no sense as that was out in 2014
i personally like the show. think it s very good. but you are right about this being a filler episode. it was definitely the worst episode so far. it wasn t bad  but i do believe this was an extra episode for the primary reason of being  woke  and to please the gay community. i actually don t care about who loves who  but doesn t mean i want to see it pushed on me time after time now. i think the story of bill and frank was way more important than this one for progressing the story  even though a lot of the episode was unnecessary. tell us bill and frank are a couple  i don t really need to see them in bed together. just my two cents
i haven t watched one second of that woke garbage.
whether you like or not  that episode was a filler episode. if it s the same as the dlc  then that dlc sucks ass story wise. i have seen filler episodes in bad anime shows with a more interesting developments and stories than this episode. literally nothing interesting happens and a character dies that we have known for one episode  so big deal
the game if full of filler if you haven t played and it follows pretty well script and scene wise to explain what the game didn t this early but the gay episodes are not needed tbh
it s literally the game.
i d hardly call lev an antagonist
she s talking to the homophobes  are you homophobic
some of these scenes happened in the game though... like the arcade and them kissing. but yeah too much wokeness for the sake of it
i just hope to god they don t do this bad on the fallout tv series!  the rings of power dumpster fire and this show  written by zombies i think  have me worried.   and as a christian gamer  thanks for speaking up for us .. since we don t have representation.  and i m not demanding it in every freaking piece of entertainment either.
im sad becuse the world hates anything that dousent fit its agenda and now i cant like other men or fap myself or do anything or im going to hell and i cant be againsed overuse of anything the left douse eather or like and enjoy the games and movies plus shows i like without critisisem  the only way i can enjoy or like any of it is if i be quiet ignore the internet and not tell anyone or express my enjoyment and welp thats not enjoying somthing  if its woke everyone hates it even though it has a good point to it or is just two hot dudes getting it on its all of sudden whrong  and if its somthing more manly and badass all of sudden its recest  wtf do i do help me how can i live my life if everything i love reprisent and am the very spirit of is hated by all sides of politics and the internet  am i just trash and not worthy of anyones care  becuse thats how i feel somtimes.
it s a pretty stock standard post apocalyptic storyline  nothing amazing or fresh
@dave kolan  i guess the whole cortycepts fungi thing was kinda unique  i will say that the game was competent for it s genre  solid controls  decent writing  decent characters  etc.i don t recall the  tough guy who softens up to a daughter figure  story being as overplayed back then. but yeah it didn t have a lot of new and interesting concepts in it.
so if it s not straight  white  and christian than it s automatically a disaster
or maybe she s not the evangelical homophobic and transphobic type of christian that a lot of the haters are  there are some christians who support the lgbtq community and are part of the community as well
dude the episode was literally a dlc in the game
so you haven t played the game either
it was not a filler lmao. it s important to ellie s character and it directly influences her decisions in the current time. if you can t see that  i m afraid you just need to exercise that little pea brain some more. it s called good writing. hope this helps.
@schneed  her decision to do what  try to save joel  you mean after she dragged him with her instead of his more healthy brother she might have abandoned him if not for that useless story  maybe you two are more alike than you think then
@havec  it is literally in the show  it shows her hesitation for a moment  that s when we get the ellie   riley flashback.so yes  yes her decision to do that. congrats! you did it. so proud of you little bud.
@schneed  what a garbage human being then. the only reason joel is there with her and not his more capable brother is because she was acting like a kid who wants no one but her parent in episode 6 and now she was going to abandon him  if i am joel and i realize that  i am going back to my brother. she ain t worth it.
@havec  ok. why are you telling me your personal opinion on the story  i was talking about facts and there you go getting all emotional. typical of people of your caliber lol. stay mad bud. have a good one!
@havec  so emotional. typical man lol.
@havec  lol
the last of us is not the greatest story in video game history. i personally like resident evil s story. a corrupt government and pharmaceutical company create a bio-weapon that s unleashed into the public and they end up nuking the city in the third game. it doesn t matter how cheesy the acting is  that is one epic story line. pure action with many layers to the story. it s more realistic because it s not the end of the world  the first three games end the main story and then it branches out into multiple stories of future corruption.
look i m not for this woke bullshit. but  stuff like this makes me wonder if you played the dlc.  i agree that episode 3 was a filler episode  and was clear pandering. but this episode with was not a filler it clearly explains why ellie  is afraid of being alone  and why people around her die. also it explains  how she got bitten and her life before being with the fire flys.  i feel like one side panders and caters too much. and i feel like this side just looks for anything to be mad and get mad about. again i m not for the woke nonsense but there has to come a point where there needs to be a balance between the 2. it s gonna come to a point where neither side can enjoy anything and we re all gonna start killing each other
well  i ain t watching it either way.. thank the no-name actress for the advice
i watched it today and it honestly felt creepy to see this older girl creep on this younger girl. the younger girl didn t want that type of relationship  the older girl kept looking at her like she just wanted to push her down and rip her cloths off. it honestly felt like a grape was about to happen any moment. it was creepy and honestly it felt dirty to watch. if this is what they re going for  this show isn t for me and i m part of the lgbt community. is the game like this.
hey  let that be their attitude.  don t like it  don t watch it.  is a simple and effective solution.but! if you wanna have that attitude  then no more bitching and moaning about  problematic  content in our tv  films  video games  literature  etc. good for the goose  good for the gander and all that.
never played this game  but i was willing to give the show a shot. personally  i think it s overrated and stopped watching it after the 2nd episode. everything i ve heard about the subsequent episodes has confirmed my assumptions. i did find the young actress to be particularly annoying  but not as annoying as the showrunners ramming all this gay representation stuff down everyone s throats. no thanks  but i enjoy the fallout.
i m with the  anti-woke  crowd most of the time  but this time i have to strongly disagree with the backlash towards this episode. they told the story one for one like it was in the dlc  excluding the the hunt for antibiotics for joel in the mall  yes  melonie  there is other game play aside from the ellie riley stuff in the dlc  in case you forgot  and it s arguably more challenging than the base game . nothing more  nothing less. you can all calm down  now.
personally im not against anything gay  but i am pretty sick of everything being sexualized. that being said  the real bummer is in the repetitive loop of lou  chacter journey   introduce new character   character death  rinse and repeat.
you know it could have made an interesting story to see a homosexual character who has to reconcile their preferences with the reality that situation creates in a world with very obvious lack of resources to care for them when they age.
she s gay in the video game so nothing that is unexpected  but the higher powers at be definitely wanted to make this show happen for the agenda
this bait and switch bs is why i wait for one of the super nerds  like melonie  to take the show apart  before i invest my attention.  after the second episode dropped  i am glad i never bothered to watch any of it.
this isn t a filler episode  it s literally from the game  and shows how ellie got bit  and thus how she found out she was immune. maybe you could say that for episode 3 but not this one.
this episode just went on way to long
some of the comments are quite hypocritical. when i heard there were two gay men in episode 3  they had a problem with it  but they re ok with ellie s bisexuality just because in the game. i kinda thought the writers would have her straight in the series but apparently they can t do that
no creepo but at least riley in the game was a cute kid.  don t be weird they got butch daniel s for the show holy.
the show is absolutely incredible so i honestly don t care whose falling in love with who in this because the show is just too good.
bill s episode was the worst of the season so far  but i wouldn t call this episode a  filler.  the point of this flashback happening before ellie left joel to die was to build emotion and show that she wasn t about to lose someone else close to her. so then she returns to joel to stitch him up. it was really well done.
dear riley i don t like it.i haven t watched it. don t intend to  either.
i have to agree with melonie on the needless injection of the alphabet gang into what would otherwise be a decent show or movie. as a straight white man  what people do in their private lives is their business. hollywood should want their work to appeal to the largest portion of society to be profitable. this doesn t seem to be the case. another trend i see that is somewhat disturbing is the need to have beautiful white girls get into relationships with black guys. it may exist in this world but is it really that common  somehow i don t think so.
17 17 - god made his reality so that no one ever really gets away with anything  and even if they  get away  with sin in this life  they will pay infinitely for their transgressions in the eternal torment to come in hell unless they turn to christ for salvation.
@lingr icen  still ten times better than gay filler episodes lol
she most certainly did not play the game lol. if she did  half the shit she said in this video would have never been said.
so you obviously haven t watched game of thrones either
@daury davis  is there a compulsion to
yes
your first sentence says it all lol
what bait and switch   story is the same as in the games for the most part lol.  clown emoji in the comments section should be saved for comments like this one.
it s literally based off a dlc
@daury davis  still doesn t change that went on way too long and i got bored and it seems like a lot of other people got bored too
@bladesofgrass  just goes to show you never played the game
@daury davis  i did play the game and i found the dlc boring as well
@bladesofgrass  so you have no room to complain then
@daury davis  that makes zero sense i watched the series therefore i can critique it . are you dense
ellie isn t bi btw  she s lesbian. i do think that they re also more receptive to ellie because she s a woman. it s easier for homophobic men  unsure about homophobic women  to accept female homosexuality since it s something they can sexualize  be it openly or secretly.
they shouldn t change any character s sexuality from the game either direction.
@schneed  she may be in a relationship with another female but in the game  you have to admit  she took an interest with a magazine of nude men.
@16shogunelitegreen  she took an interest in it as a joke. she very obviously isn t actually genuinely interested lmao. she s a confirmed lesbian. get over it.
@16shogunelitegreen  you just admitted you aren t watching the show. i m assuming you re not that big of a fan of the game either considering you didn t know something so integral to ellie s character  yet you speak on it as if you do. so no  you don t know what you re talking about haha
@schneed  just because i didn t bother with the dlc or the second game  i still know what i m talking about  ha-ha. i have much other games to play so of course once the main story was finished  i deleted it to make space
@16shogunelitegreen  if you didn t consume the canon content of the games then no  you don t know what you re talking about fully. you have an idea but you re spouting things about the game and the characters that are simply untrue yet claiming you know what you re talking about. you see how that doesn t make much sense  no
@turner ike  all i said was that folk were quick to accept ellie with whatever she is  but complain when it was two male characters written for the episode. that s all!!!!!! also which  heard the second game got bad reviews. please enlighten me for i ve been hearing that it s woke but since you ve probably played part 2  i don t know  but what are your views upon it
@16shogunelitegreen  but since you didn t play the game you wouldn t understand these critisms  you re just going based on zero context. the reason people accept ellie and riley is because it s basically a carbon copy of the games dlc  the episode is even named after the dlc so fans of the game knew what to expect. the reason people don t accept bill and frank as much is because it was a complete departure from the game - the most entertaining hilarious parts of the bill section  bill vs eliie banter arguments   plus bill saving joel from a trap  and bills grumpy yet kind attitude was completely disregard for 1hr 30mins of a love story  with him and ellie not even meeting each other.
@16shogunelitegreen  the 2nd game is hated for alot of reasons  some of which i don t really agree with. but for the most part....spoilers..........a certain beloved character is taken out in brutal fashion very early in the game. some people said the circumstances of how it happened didn t make sense  which i disagree with. another is the false advertising of said beloved character as if he was a big part of the game - i agree with that critism. the woke part argument is subjective and really didn t bother me. they also hated that you play as the killer of said beloved character  i didn t like that but it was whatever gameplay was fun  what i didn t like is how they tried so hard ro make her sympathetic and expected folks to empathize with the character by making her empathetic to a sworn enemy and her trans sibling for saving her life even though she killed the beloved character who had just saved her life. all these critisms i can get over  but the one i can not accept is the ending which made zero sense - where someone murders 100s of people to get to the one person she wants to kill  then when she finally gets the opportunity  she remembers the beloved character killed in the beginning playing a guitar and decides to forgive  that right there was ridiculous and can t be excused. hope i made some sense with this essay lol
how is that even relevant
you weird bro
this same plot point was in the game from 10 years ago. it s not as if they just added it recently to further push wokeness. ellie is a gay character  and her love interest going forward into seasons 2 and 3 play an important part in the story. joel is straight. joel s brother is straight. the main character coming up  ellie s enemy  in season 2 is straight. would you say that that s pushing a straight agenda episode 3 was hamfisted. it was also not in the game  so it makes sense that it just feels forced. it adds nothing to the story. and even the dude that co-wrote it  not the main lou writer  said he just wanted to trick people into watching a gay story. that was a big mistake  because now people aren t going to trust ellie s story as genuine and judge it as woke. however  ellie s story isn t so cut and dried.
ha. well i hope you go back to it with an open mind. just pretend episode 3 doesn t exist. after episode 3 or 4  things get pretty emotional. i d focus on the relationship between joel and ellie and how they build love for each other. as the story goes on  you ll see that things become both extremely beautiful and harrowing at the same time.i really love the story of lou  and seeing the woke people latch on to the most meaningless parts just to virtue signal is doing the story a huge disservice.
i agreed with you until you brought up the bible. now i know all your opinions is because you re a christian instead of just being logical
i m surprised anyone made it this far to begin with. it s an adaptation of a mediocre game.
based
so  while i agree the gay episodes were filler episodes by definition  there s something annoying about a highly opinionated critic who admits she hasn t watched the series.
lol... i can t wait to see all the whining over season 2
just to be clear  ellie was retconned as gay in the dlc. this was likely due to neil druckmann liking the fact that w. earl brown decided to subtly play bill as gay  which was approved  not written in the original script . ellie showed zero signs of gayness in the main game.
not following the show  but this particular episode is anything but filler by definition. from what i have seen it is pretty much a 1 1 adaptation of the left behind dlc. every other critique of this show is valid  but this right here was faithfully adapted and there is nothing particularly wrong with it.
i agree....  why couldn t they keep the plot line moving forward in accordance with the game   !!! and why were  both  filler episodes about himosexuakitt     !!!! obviously they are promoting homosexual woke agenda! that s exactly what it is!!!!! now if they made both homosexual episodes flow with the context of the story plot line naturally and not be stand alone filler episodes  then i think may people  including me  would not have issue with it.
if i m being honest  i really enjoyed this episode. i thought it was a great adaptation of tlou s dlc and it flowed well into the beggining of winter. it was much  much better than that travesty of episode 3.
are you new to this show game  there is only one strait couple left in this world. tommy   his wife. i mean duh  that s why its called  the last of us  smh
if they just had a gay character or a trans character  that s ok  as long as they re not doing a sexuality switch on an established character. but they devoted an entire episode to  representation.
please continue to preach  the people obviously need it.
idk i mean canonicaly ellie is gay with the dlc to the game that im ok with. the bill episode was weird imo
episode 6 was not all bad  but i don t have the great excitement about this series anymore like i did for the first 2 episodes. all left wing stuff has killed a lot of my enthusiasm. i m still watching because there s pretty much nothing else to watch on tv and pretty much everything is even worse. i didn t like the newest episode of mandalorian either because it s a damn festival of feminism.
it is the latest fad  like disco...........
why does hollywood insist on putting children in sexually charged situations and then get upset when they re accused of being groomers this episode was completely useless and i found myself getting angry at the terrible acting  the absolute shit dialog  and the stupidity of making all that noise in a lit the f... up mall when the cordyceps are attracted to sound! ! i care about joel and ellie s story   not ellie s lesbian back story.i like this show a lot  but my interest is falling off after a second pointless filler episode.also   hate the sin  not the sinner.
ironically myself and the majority of other gays i know are actually turned off by all this. it tends to come off as both shallow and patronizing. problem is most of us sane  lgbts  have effectively  lost our right to talk .
or played the game
really really bad take from the actress. they already saw how rings of power went down and doing this is just sparking the same end
you re not too smart  huh
last of us is basically a show about how all the gay people in doomsday world died in some tragic love story. every episode.. some gay couple days at the end after there bitten..
that s a lie
what about the porno mag
@the nerds word  any child would react the same way. in fact  she seemed more interested than gay.
@philthestampede  no not everyone would act like that when your a kid
@the nerds word  okay fine. gay kids would do whatever you do  i guess.
@philthestampede  if i was gay what s wrong with that   what do you have against them
@philthestampede  just what is your personal problem with being gay   if it s a religious belief i can t really divulge further into the conversation just because i m probably not persuading you that being gay is fine.  so what is your reasoning
@philthestampede  ok some explaining needs to happen on my part1.i m not gay2. thank you for telling me about your opinions on it3. are you arguing your problem with it is that ellie is gay or is that ellie is a kid and is gay
@philthestampede  also you don t have to call me crazy we could just have a conversation.  why do you care so much if ellie is gay if she was gay in the game  even if it was dlc .  it s possible you don t care and if you wanted to just get the facts out then i will sit down and shut up
@the nerds word  i didn t have a problem. i just don t like retcon. ellie wasn t officially gay until the dlc. but once gayness was up for grabs  neil druckmann went absolutely batshit with it. he turned ellie gay. he turn the entire sequel gay. and idc what anyone says  abby is trans. when someone focuses entirely on sexual identity  there s little room for much else. it left the story and personalities feeling stale and unrealistic. unbelievable and unrelatable. before 2016  most normal people didn t have a personality that entirely revolved around their sexual fetishes.but the only point i was originally making was that bill wasn t gay until the actor decided to try it out. and it kinda fit. lonely in the apocalypse  straight dude goes for the bhole.  this was turned into something completely in-your-face for the show  and ellie was not gay until the dlc. she was retconned. the magazine scene was debatable at most. and only with hindsight. i doubt many people pre-dlc were talking about whether a teenage character was gay.
so ellie was supposed to be the stereotypical gay in order to be seen as gay  lol
@daury davis  they didn t write her to be gay until the dlc. i don t know what you mean. are you saying they wrote her to be secretary gay
joel and tess babes  and 50  of the romance is ellie and her crush and the ellie and dina. it s more found family than romance but the romance adds more interest and later conflict to the story.
episode 3 was a message for joel
sounds like something a cultist would say
someone s never played the game
@daury davis  yes  i admit that wholeheartedly i m  judging the show on it s own merit .
lmao you re so contrarian just for the sake of it. you remind me of like a female tucker carlson
don t like it  and not watching it.
it s not a filler the episode is literally based off the dlc left behind. at least know what you re talking about.
lbgtq . content needs better labeling. please check all that applies  l  x   b     g     t      q         .
i think the ratings disagree with you  the show is killing it. gay  straight  bi whatever. so we can tell straight stories and pretty much watch them having sex but it s not ok to have gay characters
so  to basically sum up what you said. hate the sin  love the sinner. also  these people are groomers.
if this is  woke  it s done properly  if they made joel gay! now that is pandering to the woke agenda! rings of power was more gay   woke than this without gay characters
just a boring flashback episode that you could see where it was going from the first 5 minutes.
this is exactly why i m not watching it
i didn t watch it.
you don t need religion or a bible to tell you being a blt is wrong lol
at least now i know i did lost a lot by not playing this game  not into lgbt entertainment  then again im not a ta of such entertainment.
don t like don t watch it.  yeah that has been the plan for a while now. i have no interest in that stuff.
i guess meta pc sell homophobic computers.
this show doesnt represent me so i m not watching
yeah  i stopped watching it. wont watch anything else on hbo
not watching it .
done. wont watch it.
these  gay episodes  y all keep talking about are literally in the game and this is a show based on the game so what exactly did y all think.  you can t watch this show and call shit  filler episodes  when it s literally the game bill and frank were gay in the game and ellie and riley were together in the game so what exactly is the problem if you don t like it  like she said  don t watch it.  weirdos.
they re following the game though  which is the original material ellie is gay. get used to it  there will be more.
bye homophobe
so much hate in you little mouse. how is this hate video sponsored
new testament.
what i find funny about it is there is a gay character and she s the main character but they have to make characters who aren t gay  gay. tired of it.
this is cringe  . everyone s got a platform now
read the bible  son. it s the pranksters bible...
i fast forwarded both episode cuz im not watching shows for degeneracy.
isn t ellie gay in the game  why are you guys now upset about it
thank you for saving us time so we can avoid their crap too.
the game literally does the same thing  why the hell is everyone pissy when the creators have done exactly what everyone wanted and stayed true to the source material.. i don t agree with the left hardly at all anymore but i think the right needs to do some growing up and look inward to stop being so damn hypocritical too.
i don t get it. where are these hateful people reid is talking about  nobody in real life is talking about this.
i really wanted to see about joel   his brush with death   instead i was held hostage by drunk teenager lesbian making out. kind of pervy shit right there. the dlc was boring   so was this filler episode too
1. it is a filler episode. too early 2. now i dont need to see the rest. and yes  i look for content....great story telling. now i am bored...
this lady is one simple and closed minded person.  i don t want same sex relations rubbed in my face.  did you ever consider that gay people don t always like having opposite sex relations rubbed in theirs  what is offensive about inclusion that you have to go and make a youtube rant about it
her videos all the same thing nowadays . talk about something else .
i m not watching it  and i didn t need a person who plays pretend for a living to give me permission.
stopped watching after episode 2 and i don t intend to return. the original story of the first game was great  i am happy with it and i don t intend to ruin it for myself with woke bs.
i heard it was woke bait and switch so bollocks to it
huh
i don t consider the two gay episodes as canon.
these  anti woke  babies are running out of things to cry about lmao. did you know you could just skip the episode if you don t wanna watch it
the verses you re looking for are  deuteronomy22 51timothy2 9-10leviticus20 13
homophobes  she s referring to the homophobes
nope
lmfao. play left behind dlc        its the same ellie kisses riley. you all forgot about the game i guess lol
stopped watching after the first episode.
i swear all the people that hate on  woke media  are obsessed it s all you guys talk about it s kind of sad lol. tired of this getting recommended  y all groups of people are so negative and sad.  like honestly don t watch go outside there s more to life than media
you obviously didn t play the game
i am unicron im am flattered to be the first
ok
she s right  don t watch it if it sucks.. i m not watching any of it.
babylon and sodom and gomorrah
as a christian  i love watching people get shot and stabbed but gay people kissing makes me feel some kind of way  and i don t like it! any time this show turns the camera away from joel and ellie in the present timeline i m going to lose my damn mind! that s not how you tell a story  and i should know because i watch a lot of tv.
the difference is that the g4 revival sucked and the last of us show is good.
proverbs 6 16 19 lists seven things which are also abominations   haughty eyes  a lying tongue  hands that shed innocent blood  a heart that devises wicked schemes  feet that are swift in running to mischief  a false witness who utters lies  and one who spreads strife among brothers.
it s already pushing agendas the show is over
it isn t a  choice ! i we they them were born this way!   so much for  free will . and might as well throw in  pro-choice  while  we re  at it
i think it s fine at least this episode had something to contribute to the story unlike the bill episode it shows how she got infected in the first place but they didn t need the entire episode for that i think it s more there trying to stretch it out because soon they ll be killing off joel and that will be the end because pedro pascal is the series
damn how gay can a zombie show be  holy frijoles! loli feel like us straight people are being underrepresented. i m the victim!also can zombies be gay
its just so obviously quotas and checkmarks. every time theres an lgbtq character in anything now i just roll my eyes. its never organic  its just because they can tick their   muh representation box
stopped watching after episode 3  big gay al s big gay boat ride.
these characters were gay in the games aren t you supposed to be a gamer
i got about a quarter way through the second episode then turned it off forever it s total garbage.
wtf are you complaining about  it s literally the same story from the dlc
it didn t suck though
um  this was in the game soooooo  and also the show s already got a second season coming
@daury davis  um yea no iam pretty sure nothing in the story matches the game plus it s so obvious they push  an agenda on people as far as iam concerned it won t last more seasons after they kill joel anyway!hell the only reason  i watched the first season was to see where it was going to go but no need to watch season 2 as i know how it will end now that i watched season 1!
and why was it dlc  my good friend  it detracts from the main story of joel and ellie  father and daughter. it would have worked as a spin off episode between season 1and season 2.
the last of us dlc forcing ellie to be gay even was already horrible enough  of course they had to put it in the crappy show! it s what they do  they forced their sick agenda onto everything.
never knew about a gay couple in last of us and hearing it s a dlc make sense  since i never played the dlc.
i am becoming less and less interested in watching the show. the games are enough for me.
i honestly thought that episode was pretty boring.
you just saved me an hour and i thank you  that last gay episode had way too much cringe  glad i missed it this week.  i m done with this nonsense.
ok we wont
bruh it s their game who are you to say she wasn t gay from the beginning
there is a gay couple in the main game too  it s just one of them is already dead. bill and frank are gay in the original game lmao.
@schneed  how you find out they are gay. i played through the entire game at least 3 times and it never sounded like they were gay. more like best buddies that sticked together but fell apart one time.
i m sorry i agree with how they are definitely pandering but you can t speak on something you yourself haven t watched. you really should watch it and get the hole thing if you re going to make a video like this on it because you re just going to come off as ignorant.
when we    finally    got some fucking excellent tv after all the woke shit from disney  marvel  star wars   amazon  netflix... you are unable to appreciate it and see the abysmal differences. how fucking sad...
boring episode  painted ellie as a psyco again  attacking a fellow girl for asking her to work harder seriously injured her. ridley didn t want to work so she joined a terrorist group... the writing of the show is bad af!
smh......whatever
soooo if having to be seen and reparation is a problem why  y all  people got upset when sarah was casted and she was mixed raced. it goes both ways. now go in the corner and go read a your bible. and like she said  dont watch!!!!
oh  don t worry i haven t watched a single episode and never will.
but actually this is the truth about everything .... if you don t like it don t watch it nobody force anybody anyway i don t get the hate about gay people if you ever played the games this is a part of the story and that episode was a build to elie s character so i don t see where is the problem with this oneoh wait a minute the problem is that you saw an love story about gay people and you are str8    evil has found us  my god hahahhah lol
i started watching it  and thought  dang  another gay episode. is this the only kind of relationship tv producers believe in now  only about 7  of the population is gay. but the hollywood people want to make it 90  of the characters. disney committed to having half of its characters as lgbtqe  @   but i suspect it will be more than just half of them.
or perhaps the number has double because people are now more comfortable with  coming out . it s people like you that make it difficult for people to live in their truth. also a story line can be entertaining and good even with representation you saying that hollywood should focus on the storyline rather representation doesn t make it mutually exclusive your logic is simply not there hun
cry harder
i really didn t care for this episode. this is the second time past experience episode this show has done. once was fine. the second time is going overboard. it s really not moving the story along. and i thought this show was going to be great. we ll it s not. all in the family tv show from the 70s and 80s when there was a drag queen story line every so often in the show  they did better script writing than this. it had style. this show has no style.
and so i don t watch the show and didn t finish playing the last of us  part 2. didn t like either so i couldn t care less.
well this did come from the game and the dlc.  most people who have played the last of us or know of the last of us  knows that elle is gay.  you seem to be griping about nothing.  are you going to complain when the start to do the last of us 2 story line    you complain how the shows are not authentic to the games.  well this show is being authentic to the game.
i stopped watching it
they were gay in the game
i will never understand why some people care so much about how people live their lives.  what a dumb take.  under your logic gay people should be able to call out  pandering to straight people  whenever they see heterosexual couples on tv.  you could ve saved a lot of time by just saying how scared you are of gay people and left it at that.  what a world we live in.
no no melonie the bible has been reserved as a non historical book
i stopped watching part way through the first episode. if they take the name of the lord in vain  i know it is trash.
lol geez this is just embarrassing... i hate the woke pandering... but ellie was always gay in the games... she s a literal tomboy
no one is watching itlol
in this case i agree with her. this is from dlc for the game. maybe some of you guys should familiarize yourselves with the source material before you start crying woke everytime a gay person shows up. anybody who actually played the game knew this was coming.
never watched it.  pass.
they re gay in a post apocalyptic era.  makes sense.  at this point  it s not zombies that would end humanity  it s gays who will end humanity.
well  u can read bible or ask yourself one question  why rome fell
ex-homosexual and ex-transgender  here.no  i wasn t born that way. i choose it  just as they did. mental illness doesn t have to make sense to the well.
i hate woke hollywood  guess what i am not watching despite loving the first game. people are so sick of them sticking their ideology in everything.
stopped watching after second epi. the game was better.
they should just clear things up and rename it  the last of us gays  that way everybody knows what to expect. and if that is what you like you can watch it. and myself and others know up front it is not for us.
when i found out it was about gay romances instead of.... ya know... fungus zombies  i knew it wasn t made for fans of the game.
i dont like it and i stopped watch it after ep6
is this one of these thequartering knockoff channels
surprise surprise surprise.  representation  it is more like over-representation. that is what this push-back is all about. it is not about being anti-gay or anti-trans. the push-back is about the over-representation. it is just too much.
tlou2 is such trash  why watch the show when u know what s coming
funny that no one cared that that they were gay in the game. it s almost like it s not about that and they are just using accusations of homophobia to defame people with genuine complaints about the quality of the show.
psycho christian
well its about time anyways you really like this species why
you like the first game but hate that they included scenes from the game and even added a little extra from the game  lol
but i wish they would be upfront about it. this is like the third series in a row where they start out good and normal get you interested then start throwing in all the agenda shit in the third and fourth episodes. completely letting me down and wasting my time. just tell us up front it s a gay show. i don t care. but quit trying to sneak it up on me. am not homophobic. but that lifestyle is not my thing and literally makes me nauseous to watch men behave that way. they can do it. i don t care.but i do not want to be tricked into seeing it.
yup but i think she s worse than thequartering due to how much of a lunatic she comes off with her radical beliefs
sadly ellie and dina recieved a lot of hate in the second game
thanks  i didn t watch. i didn t play the games either. can t complain too much that a tv adaptation of a gay-as-hell video game  is also gay-as-hell. and i m not  phobic.  the finger pointers don t even know what  phobic  means. they re free to  appeal to their fringe audience. they better hope there are enough people watching  to make this worth it.  bros  comes to mind.
ok then i won t watch it.  this tv show is total garbage.
getting angry over stuff that is already in the game is cringy af and makes u all sound like tiktok fragile libs.
shame  i was waiting until season 2 when they introduce the trans agenda to bail.
what are you even on about here  the episode is literall cannon. you complained alot about the pilot in the  drinker after shots . did you play the game the same amount as watching the show  not making it past the prologue  cause you sure sound this way.
how can you weigh in on a show that you ve only watched one episode of  why even comment on it  makes absolutely no sense! oh wait  you need content for your channel. how about commenting on a show you ve actually seen.
the show is horror and people doing horrid things to each other. that means horror is to make you feel uncomfortable and feel people are nasty to each other.some people have the audacity to complain they saw horrific images and acts in a horror show. so what their are gay people in the show  so what get over it  there are gay people in your country and deserve not to be hounded for their life. kids online have no understanding of things and get horrified by tv. grow up!
if you haven t seen the show  then you don t get to speak on it. you re making yourself look real stupid right now. also  the gay characters in the show were already gay in the game. there s nothing to complain about. it s an accurate adaptation and they re staying true to the source material.
major pass on the whole series
there is a trans character    is abbey trans now
and with football. put a woman on an nfl pro football team! lets see how good she would do! that would be a joke!!!!!
i don t hate gays. i am however sick of watching shows that are only showing gay interaction. there aren t that many gays out there to equal the gay on our shows. i ve stopped watching.
no problem.  haven t watched it  never will.  will they ever learn
i don t watch it
at the end of the day  this show is crap
imagine doing a 27-minute video about trans people and jesus christ and how wrong actress opinion is. even tough  you didn t watch the episode nor the whole show. if you want to argue about a topic  you must listen to both side before you can make a good case.
the second game killed the franchise dead.not making time for anything with even a wif of woke garbage in it.
if they cared about representing the infected than more than homosexuality  it d be an amazing show... and i m an atheist who loathes the bible
let s face it being gay on these series is trendy. i m so glad i don t buy into it just like the whole incest thing on game of thrones. yes don t watch it.
don t like it don t watch it. how about we just don t post children engaging sexually in tv shows straight or gay
how do you know abby but assume she s trans
@daury davis  i know she is not
that episode was boring as fuck . the other with bill was not boring.
thanks ill skip this show
i was told going woke meant tlou would go broke   why didn t tlou go broke
i never watched it because i knew that they will want to push homosexually down in our throats and represent it as if 50  of the world s population is gay. no thanks hollywoke. i actually take my entertainment seriously. instead of promoting heterosexuality  you know  the relationship that actually gives life to a society they do the exact opposite. that just shows their stance and priorities.
lol. of course nobody is watching it so this is another show that will die after 1 season. that s like a starbucks barista telling customers that if they don t like the latte they can go somewhere else.
don t really care about the gay element of the episode  but it was just boring as all hell
god this video is so stupid. i mean i only watched the first 1 25  but i can unequivocally make a judgement call right now on the whole thing. after all  i read a few comments in the comment section and those opinions seem ripe for the picking.
actually  episode 7 was really good. episode 3 was not  and that was because the story was not believable.  the romance was  however  but it s still disturbing and disgusting.  as a christian who follows christ. as much as i know its wrong and it is. the episode was still good. sucks she s gay. but that s nothing new. was written like that 10 years ago in the game.all im trying to say. was it was a good episode to watch despite the relationship that was happening.i also had no idea the actress that plays ellie is a christian aswell but not sure how genuine that is.
this is the versus from deuteronomy 22 5   the new international version  niv 5 a woman must not wear men s clothing  nor a man wear women s clothing  for the lord your god detests anyone who does this.
i didn t mind the two gay guys at least their story was interesting but this episode with the lesbian forehead was incredibly boring nothing happened....oh we went to a mall yay...i really wanted the monsters to eat them in the first few minutes.  i really don t care if there s an interesting story for example the gay entertainer in the fifth element was hilarious i loved him but this was a boring nothing with no point except to try and force their issues it makes no difference to the story if this episode doesn t exist so if your not into it skip this and go straight to the next one you miss nothing.
i don t like it  so i haven t watched it. i don t care how good it might be. i don t like hbo or the guy whose name i forgot who wrote the last of us. so i don t support them.
didn t even watch any part of the series. not really into it  characters designs really cannot make it.
you turned into a full time hate watcher now huh  big yikes
in the game ellie is gay so is not woke. if you  play the game you now ellie like womans.and is not filler do some work please
look most of the world accepted lesbian s and we ll at least the ones that still looks like women however it s the too men kissing thing hate
she makes some really good points until she starts preaching the bible lmao. maybe we can do better than what uneducated people were thinking over 2000 years ago
yeah  definitely don t watch it. it s not very good  waste of time. done with it.
bro cannot call yourself a enjoyer if this game and call this fillerit s literally in the fucking game
not watching this show because i knew it was eventually going to be lgbt propaganda
this is worst episode i think. ellie perfomance is good but riley acting is so awkward is hard to watch. before anybody call me homophobic i like episode 3 better than this.
hbo is reporting that the last of us had yet another week of increased viewership  meaning it s gone up every week since the premiere. the second episode was a 22  jump over the first  4.7 to 5.7 million viewers  and then episode 3 rose 12  over episode 2  up to 6.4 million. for the record  this kind of thing just doesn t happen  even with hbo s other megahit shows.
homophobic as hell  yikes
it s even worse since she doesn t even watch the stuff she s hating on.
it is but it s also filler.
@fluffy bunny
wasnt ellie gay in the show  i dont see any issues with any of these episodes. if the creator of the game or story is running the show  i cant shit on their choices. rings of power was diff  the creator is dead and the show runners just ran wild with bullshit. tlou episode 8 was awesome.
last of us gradual fall in ratings after the season is over.
i hated the dlc for the first game. not because of the gayness but because it sucked.
i dont like it so i didn t watch it  the game was cinematic enough and as for riley that dlc was boring and not part of the main game.
i think people just want good entertainment and be force fed an agenda. also it seems that every single thing in media has these lgbt points in them. it s exhausting. representation only matters when it comes to the lgbt community but not when it comes to normal heterosexual traditional people. it s annoying.
i respect your beliefs melonie i do agree about woke writing and how it ruins everything and drag queens teaching kids that s bizarre but to say satan and demons are to blame for sins....i know you do say hate the sin not the person ok that s a good view to take but i find anyone quoting scripture about this to be no longer exercising critical thinking that baffles me about you i love your work but i dislike the religion aspect i don t know how much you really like to go out of your comfort zone i m way out of mine when i watch 50  of your content on here i d point you to richard dawkins quote on his take the god of the old testament but i d hate to offend your sentiments i do love your style and tenacity if not your religious views on lgbtq. btw fr. is short for father you really should know that! lol
think the show is great but the gayness is definitely in your face. why couldn t the 3rd episode just have a female character
shocker  the minority is the one saying this  couldnt stand looking at her the whole episode. terrible actor too. i m tired of the gay  but was willing to let it slide despite a decade long onslaught of propaganda.  now this dont watch it crap all over again
i don t watch it. it s awful.
who cares
she probably thinks she  saves lives  by playing this role when in fact she s just boring people to death .
i hated both episodes.
i have zero interest in this show. have watched serval playthroughs of the game. so i don t have any interest in watching hbo take of this games story. movie makers are lost and unimaginative. there are no original movies or shows anymore. just stolen from everyone else.
the show kinda sucks tho
same comments from frosk.  this show is officially garbage.  a shell of it s original source material.  i can only imagine how shitty season 2 is going to be.
you can t really speak on something you know nothing about. it seems like you should really brush up on your facts  sweetie. try actually giving your audience a genuine reaction to an episode.
yes ellie was gay in the game
its about the human experience  not your personal experience. what s less valid about a human gay experience  do they not love  feel loss  struggle  celebrate  accomplish  fail  why does your human experience and your views on life have to be depicted on screen  im pretty sure 99  of media is heterosexual so your experience is repeated exponentially more than those that are gay. im a little confused as to why you are so insecure and threatened by it. in closing jesus christ accepted every sinner and we are all sinners  i think a lot of people are turned off by christianity because the interpretation of old testament scripture that espouses hate for people. the old testament is exactly that  old. jesus rejected the old testament by saying i give unto you a new commandment   do unto others as you d have others do unto you . the new testament supersedes the old and makes it obsolete  the old testament is judaism not christianity.try loving as jesus did  not hate and pass judgement as the torah teaches.
aren t christians suppose to be loving and accepting  instead of making videos crying about people getting representation.
it was overrated. i actually got good in episode 4. episode 3 was horrid
this show is boring as hell
the viewership literally doubled since the first ep  and the finale is expected to triple the views from episode 1  but go off ig
the events of the dlc are canon and intertwine with ellie s time caring for a sick joel.
@schneed  i m sure the 2nd game is canon 2  imagine the ridiculousness of 2 teenage girls battling there away across the apocalypse being taken seriously.
ellie is a lesbian in the game. all of this literally happens in a game
@len  i get it. that s not my point. the point is it s everywhere in all media and it s exhausting. games  movies  tv shows  commercials  education  and it s part of an agenda that is being pushed. it s not just about this particular issue but many issues across the board that are being crammed down out throats. i just want to be able to enjoy some form of entertainment without being educated. if these things popped up as a genuine part of storytelling  ok. but a lot of times it s placed there to get people to accept a lifestyle and adds nothing to the experience. i haven t watched to show  but yes i know about the game that she is lesbian. i just have no interest in participating in todays media in this current climate.
@donnell terry  ok then dont  literally nothing in tlou is to  educate . they are just characters that happen to be gay. imagine how it feels for queer people who didn t have any representation for decades. straight cis people  everywhere in all media so exhausting. games  movies  tv shows  commercials  education.  straigh straight straight straightttt everywehere. and you said there is no rep for  normal   implying something  heterosexual traditional people. like be for real
@len  salty much.
then watch something else.
@donnell terry  oh my god  it s almost like every piece of media is a reflection of creative expression  personal themes and messages. who would ve known
i don t watch most things and i don t care what anyone is into. if you like it  power to you. most media today do not entertain me and that s why i find other things to entertain myself. it s not creative when everyone is doing the same thing. it s trendy and therefore people do it.
@donnell terry  its not supposed to educate  its a real story a lot of people can relate to. atp you can call anything educating based on your point. person of color who is a main character  education. disabled character  oh yep that s educating. a story is a story  and these games have been around for literally years. let a story be human and reflect an experience. there will always and forever be straight media for you to enjoy  so don t stress. and if you are mad the gay stuff is better made and popular  well maybe you should direct your own show or write a book or code a game
how can you say it s awful when you just said you didn t watch it !
yikes. this is so funny to see normies freak out about a series literally adapting the source material. this episode was literally a dlc for the game back in 2014. this shouldn t be news. the last of us is a story about relationships. straight and gay. if you re mad about the amount of  woke  then this series isn t for you hun. wait till season 2. cause the gayness isn t going away.  this series is and always has been gay. so keep coping. love it
i do like your content and agree with a lot of what you say but not everyone who watches your videos are religious. so going off on a preaching rant is off putting  at least to me.
that show is complete trash!!
bodo
tlou one of the overated movie games to get two remasters within 5 plus years and a shitty show
tlou tv show is extremely overrated.and the games are extremely overrated too.
i already wasn t watching it  but it s because bella ramsey is disturbing to look at for too long. granted  knowing there are gay sex scenes in it makes me want to watch it even less. sex scenes in general ruin any otherwise well written piece of media. it s cheap and gross and uncomfortable.
looks here the thing about gay shows  the gays aren t watching it. why make a gay agenda when the gays aren t gann watch it anyways. if your gann make a gay character don t make it all about being gay. i can care less about gays being in a show i like to watch  but don t make it all about the gays.
lgbt is a c4nc3r
don t like it  don t watch it. done!i don t watch the show because i don t need an agenda shoved down my throat.
i played the last of us in 2013 then i played the remastered version on ps4 i didn t play the last of us dlc left behind i m sorry but i don t want to see two underage girls kiss i can t believe i have to start saying that now
bella ramsey had a channel where she talked about god and jesus. just 2 years ago. now she sold her soul. sad
they definitely be grooming
the show just sucks  there have been like maybe 3 decent scenes the whole season so far.
people need to stop this homophobic hate  like for real... it s 2023 and people still haven t changed... sheesh... if you don t have anything nice to say  please don t say anything at all...
hated episode 3!
clueless comments from someone who doesn t watch or understand the show...   sad!
@luca  lol... maybe you should have stopped typing your response until you understood what the comment was even about. no one said anything about the games  although  granted  i did skip playing part 2 for the exact same reason.
@luca  close enough. if the gay is in it  i don t want to watch it. don t like that  go cry to someone who cares.
the game was better.
done with this series. sad  b c when it stuck to the story it was really good. bye last of us!
its supposed to be based on a game and why does everything in every new show and movie have to have lgbt front and center for everything now a days
let me guess you never played left behind  and didn t realise ellie was a lesbian.
in a show with 9 episodes  these episodes are worse than fuller  they hijack the main plot and derail it.this show is agenda driven.left behind is dlc  not the main campaign.its tacked on content that is taking up time for the main plot  which has not been fleshed out anywhere near enough.this is not pandering  this is driving an agenda.
i don t want to watch it you keep pulling a bait and switch
it s funny that people are complaining but bill and frank are gay in the game. ellie and riley are gay in the game.
i can t just say it s bad because the main character is gay  so i m going to say it s bad because it s  filler   without even having seen the show. any show presenting a positive image of gay characters is  woke bullshit   but i am so not homophobic. shut up.
one thing i never understood. with humanity on the brink of destruction  wouldn t being gay be outlawed  or at the very least all women would be forced to have at minimum two children
the girl who plays ellie is a terrible actress
i stopped watching that tlou after episode 2. its woke garbage. if you keep watching that stuff  they will keep making woke content.
i m not going to watch it  such a dumb premise  the last thing humanity needs in an apocalypse is homosexuality.
y all have no problem w straight couples being depicted so what s wrong w depicting couples different from yours  stop w the homophobia  it s cringey that y all think you re actually making valid points when you re not
can we talk about the constant race mixing in hollywood movies and series  something like 11  of all couples are interracial and yet in commercials  tv and movies now it s like 60-70  if not more.
the last of us isn t a show about a fungus epidemic. it s about the last of the heterosexual dynamic. no more babies being made. the fungus is just a smokescreen.
the character was gay in the game the character is gay in the show who tf cares  if you do care  you re probably not a fan simple as
instead of making a character trans they need to make a human being that just so happens to be trans.
i dont like it and find it very boring. so now i am a homophobe and a transphobe for liking hogwarts. hahaaha
actually ppl would be more worried abt a loss of supplies due to overpopulation based on circumstance. so less babies   good for fedra
the last of us 2 did that  but you lot spent months laughing at lev being punched by  fat geralt.
@could have been minecraft...not going to do that.  tbf having trans characters in an apocolypse is pretty dumb  anyone who is stupid enough to be thinking about their gender and sexuality is instead rations and bullets is not someone who would survive this world.
@moe  you lot demand that a character needs to exist that just so happens to be trans  then when we provide an example you say they shouldn t exist  because  muh realism    even though the lgbt community would continue to exist in a apocalyptic setting.
