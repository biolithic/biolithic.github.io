one of the major points of jaime s character is that his family is involved. in the comics  the very first thing he does after getting the scarab and his powers is tell his parents and sister. you can t really do the blue beetle justice and not have his family there.
there s minimalism....and then there s melonie s room in this video.
i m a blue blue fan and i will say that the suit is very accurate to the original one. i honestly like the family troop  because i don t see the need to hide it from your family. the only issue i had was the personality of the suit. the scarab has a mind of it s own and usually wants to kill anything that moves  as its programmed to do without spoiling too much . so making it into this  friday  type helper feels weird.
i definitely miss the days when we could have a solo superhero movie without an entire team of regular people along for the ride because reasons.
no worries  melonie  we re here to support you through everything you re dealing with. you are what matters- not what your backdrop looks like
yes his family knows about his powers in the comics  it does look like they exaggerated how much involve they are but yeah they know all about it. jaime is very family oriented so i don t mind this at all
i am interested in this movie cuz the character has always intrigued me. i ve always liked the design for it. plus i really wanna see how well xolo does with the role. hearing that batman line was just a heart sinker. just one movie without the social tropes with all the ist s and ism s  please
if you want to see the  quintessential  versions of this character  watch season 2 of young justice and injustice 2 handled him pretty well also. he s kinda like dc s version of a kamen rider  similar to a power ranger for those who dont know
this looks like a comic book movie people would have loved in 2005.
how is batman a fascist  come on. i don t like it right there for that.
they originally wanted to be just on hbo max  but the new ceo thought it was good enough to release in theaters
blue beetle s suit is comic accurate
i read the blue beetle comics in the mid to late 60 s. steve ditko was doing them for charlton comics. i even remember the drug store where i used to buy most of my comics. blue beetle used to show up on the racks the same day as t.h.u.n.d.e.r. agents from tower comics.
i do understand where you re coming from when it comes to the family. very often when in a story like this they can often be a liability rather than helpful for the main character or even worse bog down the story to the point where it becomes frustrating to watch as we have seen with the recent spider-man movies and the recent shazam movie.
damn. going for batman  not gonna lie  it was almost a complete no for me too. it s almost ridiculously hilarious because in most adorations  bluebeetle and batman are friends  batman sees great potential in him  batman the brave and the bold .
if i want to see a family save the universe i ll just watch a 90 s kids movie.
i hear you on the  keeping the superhero secret from the family  point.  when you said that  then it clicked for me why the superhero struggle is good on film....they want to protect their family  yet they want to protect the city too -- the internal struggle. hope everything is going well for you and you are glowing this video!
ned and whatever mj that was were mid.harry osborn  original  and emma stone pulled it off in their movies as friends
exactly sis you hit the nail in the coffin isolation is what builds the hero s journey  because they are a forced to perfect what makes them special but also isolation is what makes a superhero mysterious within the world so when the story starts with batman looking like a monster reaching out of darkness and snatching people into the shadows you can hear people screaming in pain only for a reporter to be around   their looking in awe is this man with a broken arm is lying on the ground and he s screaming for their help and you just see this weird looking hand come out of the darkness grab the guy s ankle and the guy screaming as he gets pulled into the darkness then you see  the batman  just take off into the sky with the screaming man in hand like a bird carrying its pray that is what makes superheroes cool their journey   their mystery among the public eye  honestly isolation and mystery makes superheroes even more cool when you as a reader don t even know what s going on but you see these flashy panels of this really cool figures fighting crime and saving lives so you get invested anyway.
other than that batman line the trailer got me excited
thank you  my friend. you get it
they can do that wihtout showing his family in every scene it jsut feels cheap at this point
@red phoenix  cheap how also  if you re trying to sell a movie in a genre plagued with cliches  you go for what makes yours unique. it s entertainment business. not everyone gets it i see. it s not for you  dude. just let it go
not telling trusted friends and family usually ends up them being kidnapped without knowing why. i d rather know if a family member had powers.
im gay
it s nice to have a family-themed superhero film
guessing either a move  or a redecorate is happening  lol
melonialism
i am thinking she moved. she did have that stalker wierdo  knowing where she lived.
@otterloopb minimelism
@cain abel i d noticed she hadn t twitch streamed in like a month. i m missing the streams.
@gilbert kitchens oh that s so much better
@brian  i have noticed too. it is all becuase of that stalker wierdo  giving her problems.
ha ha ha!
i m going with a move  her safety comes first..
genuinely  who cares
@wicker man  the number one reason people don t file police reports for stalking  they have to submit their home address and contact info. the very things stalkers want.
@thatharvguy  that s a sin. i do hope she s okay tho!
dart maciel  this is 2023 and y all still complaining about shit not being comics accurate
yeah i don t think thier going to put in the struggle between him and the scarab their going to make it his assistant basically no inner conflict to keep it on a short leash or many people could get killed it s going to be superpower armor no consequences yay it sucks
@black frieza if it was comic accurate they d make more money this is going to flop
@jackratscratpack . and yet whenever they re is a comic book accurate movie y all will still bitch and complain about it so what s your point
@black frieza  yea but i admit the orginal source sounds way cooler based of these comments and now i feel different of the trailer. but i m not complaining. i ll definitely go watch it.
some of you don t understand why the scarab being hostile works.it sets up great stories and pay off. this is essentially the first character from james gunn universe.spoiler for the scarab.it s alien tech that s meant to kill everything haha. what s great though is that it sets up a is jaime a traitor or has he been mind controlled thing. he s essentially watching himself so horrible things and has no control. a way to fix this is to have the scarab start mimicking his voice and try to manipulate jaime into thinking they were his own thoughts. that way we get the whole back and forth which is hilarious.
no  that s the new 52 version  his family knew in the og run in the pre 52.
@gelibr va  ahhh i started reading dc comics during the new 52 and kept up until catwoman left bats at the altar and then i stopped reading anything dc.
well did the comic have a buster sword because honestly that was hype.
@jaime ruiz  you see a tiny trailer and assume the scarab wont be hostile
but in the trailer she even said the suit sometimes listens and sometimes doesn t. just like in young justice and in the d c animated movies. also it depends on which version you re basing it off of cause even the cartoons do them a little differently.
dude are you serious  there s an issue where even his grandma covers for him  another where his mother reminds him that he s getting the key to the city while in the suit and another where his dad drives him and his superhero girlfriend to the bad guys  place.please don t read just one run and assume that s it.from his original run  jaime s story has been about his friends and family
bro he literally told his whole family in the comics
@zoomcat.r6  oh really  lmso my bad. i guess i was too fixated on the young justice version lol.
he kept it a secret from his family at first but then he ends up telling them anyway. so his family being around knowing about him being blue beetle isn t all that bad. even the recent comics acknowledge that his family knows.
@nighty night  oh gotcha  yeah tbh in this case its better to just tell the family your secret identity less hastle.
@dart maciel  exactly. although i do agree with you that the suit should be a bit more violent  but this was honestly a teaser trailer more than anything cause we barley got to hear or see the scarab and jaime fully talk and interact.
i don t think it s going to be helper  there will be bit of a struggle. it cut a bus in two halves without thinking twice that there r people inside it.  but  yeah  hope it doesn t turn out like black adam where despite hyping it up as how he is anti-villian and wouldn t stop for anyone he was fairly chill with the heroes.
@jivika c  exactly lol . i just want my quirky jamie and his psychopath robot lol.
yes blue beetle  stealing from ironman. time for dc to do its own thing.
@black frieza   black frieza
@jackratscratpack  didnt he literally cut  a bus in half
how many superhero movies that have a team of regular people tagging along have been released to have you missing the  good old days
i thought the thing with blue beetle was that his family is always involved or something
@renato reyes  yeah. even his grandma knows. but apparently everything different about a story somehow ends up being cliche anyway.i just don t get people.
what happened to the word  of   what s with the  because _ noun  i don t get it!
lmao shazam did that and it flopped that 1st movie was hot garbage and 2nd was even worse
hmm yeah that background is pretty mid.
doesn t mean we can t be curious about what s causing all the changes.
@i am perplexed oh absolutely! i hope i didn t give off some sort of vibe that we shouldn t question or be curious about what s going on. apologies if it came across that way. i just wanted to remind melonie that regardless of what her set up looks like  she s what matters the most. and to remind her that most of us are here to support her through the ups and downs as she deals with everything on her plate  no matter how long that takes.
@otterloopb  facts dude. facts.
i mostly just stare at melonie s cute hair  anyway...
@colacherry12     is she gorgeous or what
that family is way too much no real latino family is like that especially  in real latin america  like central america and south america cause mexico is part of north america so.
@ariel lezcano  i never said a real latino family is like that. i said the character in the comics is family oriented and is like that. i was just stating that the movie looks identical to the source material
@ariel lezcano  well considering latinos can relate to this movie...seems like your wrong
same it s nice to have a family-oriented superhero film.
the line feels more like a joke  like maybe the mc doesn t share that opinion with whoever he is. either way we ll see in theaters.
don t get your hopes up to much. i see and hear that they ve changed quite a bit from the comics and animated shows movies that stayed true just from the trailer. just like they ve constantly done over and over. it will only get worse with the whole movie.
@even in death i still serve  like what
watch the guyver one and two. a teenager is bonded to an alien biomech suit he can t always control. came out decades ago.
you asked. spoilers.just from this trailer alone  jaime s family was never there when he found the scarab  he didn t tell them until a while later. he wasn t looking for a job  he was just a normal teen going to high school. scarab s ai wasn t a female and had a personality  it wasn t some automated answering machine. jaime never had the beetle ship  only ted kord did because he didn t have access to any of the scarab s power like flight  only his genius intellect  physical strength  and fighting expertise making him similar to batman. i only read a handful of blue beetle jaime reyes  comics a long time ago  there are likely more changes in the trailer that i didn t catch  and there are definitely going to be more in the movie. all those changes  along with the rest in the movie  and that utterly stupid line by that clown george lopez as well makes this movie just more woke garbage in my book.
@even in death i still serve  lol bet you don t even know what the word woke means. using that as a film criticism has made the word lost a lot of its meaning when it s used all the time by people like you. making some changes from comics dosent make the movie  woke . most of the time it s just used to fit and enhance the story.
@ethan kleinman  dude  have been living under a rock for the last 7 years or something  the last line on the trailer is literally there to cater to leftists on twitter. who else is that line made for  because i didn t find it funny  it is tasteless and expected at this point.
@mad dog gamer  it s a terrible unfunny joke but y all are taking it way too seriously lol. also what does the last 7 years have anything to do with this joke here  tf
yeah  back when young justice and dc s comics still had some good writing...
more like kamen is manga s version of bb lol  bb came out years before kamen did to be fair. jaime and ted kord the original blue beetle came from the 60 s
@mkf30  the og blue beetle didnt wear an armored bug suit like this until jaime reyes. ted kord was like a batman hero with bug themed gadgets
@animavox  exactly
your forgetting about brave and the bold
@flash2814  ted wasn t the first blue beetle  he was the second. blue beetle was created during the golden age  if i m not mistaken  ted kord s just the more iconic version for people who grew up with the post-crisis stuff. i personally like jaime s suit concept better  but that s just me.
@flash2814  yeah i know but was just pointing out that kamen came out years after every version of bb. jaime was the one with the fancier tech of the scarab  you re correct. they did that to stand out more from ted and dan the first original blue beetles from the 60 s  ted was similar to batman  not exactly the same as their execution with fighting is vastly different but i know what you mean.
@jackratscratpack  didn t really watch that but i ll take your word for it
sorry  but the  quistessential  version of this character is the original run on the comics. after infinite crisis and before new 52.what you re saying is like saying that batman from the harley quinn series is the quintessential version of him.
@roberto carvajal  most people who will watch this movie aren t gonna go out an read the comics  not even the film makers bother to do this. you want a good portrayal of the character in other media  you d turn to what i mentioned
morbius
and 2023.
comment
like batman begins
i d love that! much better than mcu garbage! but no! this is not it
more like 98
movie that is enjoyable  thank god
yep! it s feels refreshing bcs right now all superheroes have turned into anti-hero or gritty and dark. whereas from the trailer it feels fun.
@jivika c  it does  this is just a spiderman clone.
can we just realise that the mc is the one who plays the guy from cobra kai
@flash2814  i don t disagree with people not reading the comics  but what i m saying is that calling those portayals  quintessential  is wrong. did you read the bb comics  do you  know what quintessential means quintessential is the best representation of something  you wouldn t need anything else to understand what that thing is really about. an easy entry into the lore of the character  i d agree with that.a show and a videogame that devides it s attention among a big cast of iconic characters could not be  quintessential  to any of them unless we re talking about the team as a whole.the justice league show is not the quintessential representation of batman. the batman animated show could be the quintessential representation of batman. young justice glosses over jaime s family and friends dynamic and his relationship to the original bb  for example. i m just talking about logic.and btw. it s a misconception among  comicbook fans  that directors and writers don t read the comicbooks. it would be even more dumb than executives are to not have a small guide for a character you re investing millions on. now  when they decide to go in a completely different direction that s something else. but even in those cases  like you said  people are not going to read the comics so they have to make changes. if it works that s another discussion. but these people are handed tpbs as homework. if not  why can we trace back the plot of any superhero movie to the comics marvel  for example  has shown time and time again that they have a lot respect for the source material  even when they change stuff. i don t know how many easter eggs of 40s comics i ve seen in the mcu.
@roberto carvajal  yea i m not reading all that  ya wrote a short story to argue semantics and contradicted yourself by saying the batman animated series can be quintessential but young justice and injustice 2 can t  everything that can be  traced back to the comics  can literally be found on wikipedia. you don t need to read the comics to know the story  you re out of your mind if you  think the people taking hours of their day to bash comic book fans on twitter for caring about the lore  are actually taking time out of their lives to read comics. these are the same people who made fun of us in school for liking this stuff.
@flash2814  ok buddy. just don t bite your own tongue. it s useless using logic with people
@roberto carvajal  by your own logic the comics dont need to be  quintessential  with batman  tas  you literally bit your own tongue
cuz...muh cis  whyte  rich  male...etc
@marxisdead  sums it up
@marxisdead  well i mean in the dark knight returns he s called a fascist a lot
both batman and superman have literally been called fascist before literally nothing new.
he s not.
@grand admiral thrawn  so  this doesn t represent the whole of batman canon. honestly  frank miller s take on the dark knight is some my least favorite of the dc entries.
@marxisdead  don t you dare talk shit about frank miller! lol
@grand admiral thrawn  i didn t talk shit about frank miller. i just don t like his work. he was one of the first to start the trend of deconstructing heroes.
it s a joke karen
should have left it on hbo max...
it looks like a power rangers episode
@marxisdead  the problem wasn t that he deconstructed batman  it s that everyone after took the wrong lessons from that story and badly tried replicating it. the story only works as an elseworlds.
it s a joke  not to be taken seriously i don t know how anyone can hear a line by george lopes and believe it s a political statement.
i m doing something i normally wouldn t. i m encouraging a boycott!just for that line right there no one should spend a dime on this.we got to teach these companies a lesson big-time financially and let them know why they re losing money.we should try to make sure blue beetle will be their biggest failure they ever had
secret invasion trailer 2 was better.
@manofx  because most of people in hollywood always have make a political statement   and after a while it starts to get annoying  and even it was a joke it wasn t even a funny joke
he s whyte  haven t you been paying attention the past 7 years
that s the point.
@jonathan sanders  no
@joseph bernal  no shit. they re pointing out that the joke isn t funny and doesn t make any sense.
for me this is a netflix or amazon prime catch.
i can t imagine being offended about a comic book  cartoon or movie
dude  that s just the wierd uncle. i mean jaime idolizes batman.
@michael quaid  bro chill it s not that serious.
@history s mysteries unveiled     i can always tell the people who were never true fans to begin with..and that means you too luke
i love batman and that made me laugh give me a break
because joke
well if we are talking about batfleck who is gun crazy than yes
@alan bibian  i know right  people are reacting to the joke exactly like the marketing team wants them to
@billy johansen  omg someone who gets it. thank you.
@nightlizard1564  when this is the first i ve heard of it
@james vuk  go watch the injustice movie or read the injustice comics. both batman and superman were called that numerous times.
@creative name  ok  it s still a joke  and no shit it doesn t make sense  it s a trailer and just 1 line
it is a joke about old people calling fascist to figures in power. it is relatable to latin families. the joke was probably lost in translation.
i mean  he did murder superman in this iteration of the dc universe...
why are so many people fixating on this one line from the trailer  it s clearly a throw away joke...
@manofx  we all know it s a joke  the issue is that it s not funny and doesn t make any sense.
@michael quaid  why bb  it s a joke. sure  it s an unfunny and nonsensical one  but a joke all the same.
@creative name  the joke is targeted on ppl who actually say that  because most ppl know it s stupid
@michael quaid  my guy... how is that relevant  some people didn t even know these characters existed before they appeared onscreen- myself included. what does that have to do with a shitty joke in a superhero movie trailer
@manofx  i have never once in my life seen a take as absurd as that  even in the dark depths of twitter or reddit. i d greatly like to know who would say that so i can insult them for internet points.
@creative name  okay  if you truly want a honest conversation and have things in context...these companies seem intent on destroying every iconic character or ip we ever loved over the decades.so first of all i don t believe it was just a joke. secondly  it wasn t funny.and thirdly  i believe these companies hate people like me.and that becomes more and more clearer as time goes on.i m not alone in this.literally millions of us are noticing this over the last several years more and more...they want to prop up lesser-known characters  although i ve known who blue beetle was for many many years and destroy iconic characters.because you can t have a straight white  wealthy male be a hero anymore...they not only hate batman.. they hate the o.g. fans that love batman.so why would i spend a single dime with a company that hates me
@joel a  that s not the point. if someone called trump a rapist in a random movie trailer  you d best believe there ll be hillbillies defending him to their last breath. it s not about the fact that it s a joke  it s about what the joke says. it also says a lot about the writer s mindset  where they re going to such ridiculous lengths for a  joke  based purely in shock value.
@creative name  right  but honestly i think the hate for this trailer is way too exaggerated  and people need to stop taking it so seriously  but the actual  batman is a fascist  take is really stupid and makes me wonder who came up with it in the first place
@creative name  except its not trump  it s a fictional character who spends his nights dressed up as a bat beating up criminals
@michael quaid  you don t know me to say that   i have tons of blue beetle comics.
@luke ferrell  good for you. do you think batman is a fascist and more to the point  why do you think they would put a line like that in this movie  your thoughts....
@luke ferrell   people care more about sale million copies than review good story and character make a great movie
i don t think the movie is saying batman is a fascist. it s the character. he s meant to be a bit of a conspiracy theory doofus. not to be taken seriously as the message of the film.
frank millers batman didn t really help his image
@grand admiral thrawn frank millers batman is sort of written as a fascist.frank miller has a hard time writing characters it seemed at a certain period in his career without interjecting his personal politics and beliefs into them.holy terror was originally going to be about batman.dc thankfully said no.
@marxisdead frank didn t deconstruct him even if he claims that he purposefully believed in what he made the character out to be.it inspired deconstructions sure but it wasn t one itself
@ace m wick all star batman and robin only works if it didn t exist
@chandller burse  honestly  i don t care. it still set the trend going forward and i am still not a fan of a lot of his work.
@marxisdead  i am not saying anything to make you like him.his work is not a deconstruction as far i ve ever read and seen analyzed and as far he s even acted himself he literally has believed in what he interjects in his works.he was kind of a crazy for a time and people will argue he is secretly a genius or that he s right because they agree with his ultra somewhat extreme conservative views i don t even know if conservative fits the bill he s borderline racist against arabs and muslims back in the day it seems.he for years apparently never let go of his 9 11 ideas that he put into comics i don t know he s not a terrible writer he like garth ennis has good ideas but sometimes and often times during certain periods bad execution this is why garth ennis has good stories like punisher max but it has poor execution sometimes apparently and great ideas like the boys but its just edgy crap in the actual comic.same for frank and tdkr it was good to an extent the animated movie was probably better i say.as well as year one that was good but then theres all star and other thing .
@chandller burse  lol yeah it sucks but it s hilariously bad with some great jim lee art
doesn t even matter is a stupid joke i can t believe people are really going to take this seriously for crying out loud batman is not even real and people are going to get offended by this
@red nocturne   i hate geek and gamer because they use their platform to get view and like  surprise they milk 100 video on brie larson
i don t think you understand that in terms of the personal activities and opinions of the superheroes in the dc universe  the citizens know very little  which is kinda the whole point bc of the whole secret identity thing. these small characters making big assumptions on the heroes is a normal thing  so a character calling bats a fascist makes a lot of sense  especially since it s a comedy movie
@michael quaid  no  i m not a fanatic
mockin batman im seeing a bad future for blue beetle
facts
@ariel lezcano  they problem is batman fanboy  they treat like a god
@marxisdead  but that s not fascism. fascism is the belief a government should be in control of everything under one rule. which batman technically can be considered. think about gotham. bat s doesn t want anyone helping him  he wants to fix gotham on his own  his way  and everyone else can take the highway if they don t agree with him. which he does all the time. however right dunno why they had to include the line though  seems unnecessary
@chandller burse  ats what i m saying. batman technically is a fascist. he literally tells everybody in the jl or any hero who  tresspasses  into gotham   to leave because it s his city. bat s wants to save it himself with only regarding batfam members but they literally all report to him and only him. so bat s is technically a fascist
guys  i m pretty sure george lopez s character is a conspiracy theorist that says put of pocket things like that. hell  the main character loves batman. quit trying to be mad at something that isn t happening
ted cord the original blue beetle.
it s weird  maybe they don t like batman for being rich and they are sending the message that this is just a humble guy  just to get more woke points. add the woke points to the woke latino points... and of course his name is jaime.  the trailer wants you to remember that he s got this awesome name  jaime     lolalso the movie looks supergay.
that end stinger is deeply bizarre. batman is by far the most popular dc hero and probably the most popular hero period between him and spiderman  so it s real strange to shit on him. and yeah  if anything you d think they d try and play up batman s good relationship with the blue beetle. i don t get it.
pretty sure the brave and the bold blue beetle is the original ted kord version not jaime
i mean  peakmaker  peacemaker  called batman a pussy for not killing  so callin him a fascist without elaboration isnt that bad.
i hope you know that fascist thing was a joke. like damn you guys take it way to seriously. like geez guys.
i think y all reading into the line a little too much jaime was just saying that what looked like the original beetles tech looked similar to the stuff bats brings out which actually isnt wrong to a point when considering the original hero  it s his uncle that makes the passing comment
yup but blue beetle didn t make the comment  george lopez did! they know certain crowds will talk to give it publicity!
he wasn t the one that said it though
@lewis from spain  oh my god man  you must be a supervirgin
@lewis from spain  being latino is woke
@lewis from spain  wow the trailer wants you to remember the main character s name that has been his name since the character was written in like 2005 ok buddy
@ryang  while that guy appears later the first blue beetle we see in the show at least the cartoon that i know is jaime s version
@kaleb robinson  wow i m impressed  buddy  you know so much about this blue beetle  you must read a lot of comics. did i tell you that i m impressed  also absolutely nobody knew about this little unknown hero  except for some entitled comic readers. so my comment makes a lot of sense  and yours is simply irrelevant.
it was the uncle. blue beetle even said this is like batman. so because the uncle is probably a crazy uncle who said something a crazy uncle would say it s hot a hundred percent no now  smh
@perkyblue  the difference is that peacemaker is crazy.
@peter lenham  and so is the uncle  in that  crazy unc  way. you ever been to a latino family cookout dinner  just like black families  even mine   they also almost always have a crazy uncle  and the crazy uncle can and will say sum outta pocket. thats how it works bro.
@perkyblue  peacemaker had a really bad childhood though. if you ve seen the show you ll know what i mean.
@peter lenham  ive seen the show  it was absolutely amazingly good  im just sayin that its not fair for one to speak his beliefs on batman and be fine  but the other to do the same  most likely joking  and catch criticism for it.
@perkyblue  i wouldn t say it was amazingly good  just average.
@peter lenham  by all means the writing was nothing to write home about at times  but the show itself was amazing because of the way john cena showed a great and tallented acting range  along with good cgi  and a pretty good story  that didnt focus too much on irl societal issues  a couple were touched on  but nothin really more than that   and the show really seemed to know where it sat in its universe  instead of spending time worldbuilding  they just picked up a story and went with it  making references to stuff we haven t even seen  just like in comics.
@perkyblue  it was definitely cena s best acting  but hes still far from perfect. robert patrick acted him off the screen at every turn. now that was an acting masterclass.
@geek protagonist  what a bad take. this is tv show created by writers. everything said is said because the writers wrote it. writing shit like that shows how trash the writing in it will be. if the lopez character was meant to be a villain then you could argue  who cares he s a bad guy so obviously he hates batman  but the lopez character is clearly a good guy comedy relief character. the comment wasn t meant to be an example of  here s a crazy guy saying crazy stuff  it was meant to be a joke and there was nothing funny about it and it was frankly insulting to anyone that likes batman. so yeah  this shit writing shows what the overall quality of the show will be.
@perkyblue yet peacemaker butchers an entire innocent village and doesn t care.his insults mean actually less than frank castles own resentment for marvel heroes because at least frank despite his problems usually never kills innocent people and blows it off.
@lewis from spain  what does calling batman of fascist has anything to do with woke i think people are reading too much into this the trailer looks fine
@perkyblue  i agree people are going overboard with this just because one superhero call batman shopping bag that doesn t mean people need to riot about it
my reaction to the trailer is the suit looks good and it seems fun  but i probably won t see it. i m happy to know that they ve suggested ted kord  the 2nd blue beetle  by the bug  vehicle  being in the trailer  but i wonder if dan garrett  the original blue beetle from the golden age  will be mentioned at all as the original owner of the scarab. the batman is a fascist line was eye-rolling crap because idiots have been saying that online for a while and is a cliche at this point.
wish they had done the bb backstory from young justice. that would ve been way too epic  loved that backstory
keith giffen did a pretty good job on this blue bettle s run. but from the looks of it  the film version is going to do its own thing
i agree somewhat with your assessment. keep in mind that  going forward  spidey has to keep his identity secret after no way home.
in non-woke times  this line would ve been a comedy attempt and nothing more. maybe it still is.but i m done giving these companies a chance.
when i first started your video i was like   uh oh  someone has ms mac locked up in a bunker and is forcing her to crank out content!  spring time is the best time to get outside and start preparing everything for warmer sunny days.
i love when people who dont know anything about certain characters critique it as if they know what they talking about
man  hollywood is really going in hard and dry to shit on batman every way they could.
i love the  doing lawn work and all kinds of stuff  look melanie. touching grass is important every now and then.
i don t think it s that bad  the trailer   until that last line and i face-palmed
take care   be safe  melonie!
i m definitely no way of an expert on the actual canonical things  comics ect though trying to get a lot more into them  but to my knowledge dc is full of family things but yeah depending on how it s go about it can be a bit tired some if it doesn t fit within a character and to my remembering from what i saw with dcau with blue beetle  mostly going with batman brave and the bold and a bit with yj  i don t think he had one    maybe a normie friend but that s about it  it s been a while   full free to correct inform  me please! yeah and that line with batman almost got me too since big bats fan here
love seeing a new video  melonie. you look fantastic  shoulda guessed you d have a reaction to the batman comment  lol.
last line was enough but someone jealous of melonie s collection enough to steal it
i m just seeing the empty room and thinking...woah  what will happen next. can t wait. as for blue beetle  i am honestly eager to see it  but the whole batman comment in the trailer was just too telling  so will likely wait to watch it on hbo max.
i wish i looked that pretty after doing yardwork all day!
don t worry about the background  it s a simple background for a change
i m not familiar with blue beetle  but the trailer looks cool!
first time i saw blue beetle was in the batman who laughs volume 2  the infected. and i loved the character.
i love mary jane watson. i think she is pretty cool  in the live-action spider-man. i hope the blue beetle is a good or great movie  we need some more good and great movies.
both batman and superman have been called fascists in the comics
@billy johansen  i am aware of that. batman i see the point  but superman is nonsensical
also the reach made good villains
they re probably saving it for the sequel is this does well. involving the reach would mean a lot of cg and a lot of money. too much for the first one if they re testing the waters
that s the thing  we can t just let our guards down and relax  such stressfull times.
hollywood doesn t deserve the benefit of the doubt
@mad dog gamer  why  many movies are good  like john wick  top gun  super mario looks good and so does flash and other films on the way  many just want to hate everything  getting triggered over everything. the culture war ruins everything!
@kicknowledge smith  then why did they put the batman line in it  are supposed to just ignore it and go give them our money blindly  that s precisely what they want.
@kicknowledge smith i really don t get the hype for mario movie not that its gonna be woke or any dumb criticism like that.but it only exists to compete with sonic it seems and so far it looks kind of average and i have a feeling even if it does turn out great in like 10 years it will be one of those movies youtubers make essays on about how its actually average.i may be wrong but the only thing it feels like it really has going for it is nostalgia bait and jack black as bowser.
@kicknowledge smith in my honest opinion mario didn t need another movie mario is at its best in game form where it belongs.but money speaks louder than any sense.
@chandller burse  yup true  good points
@chandller burse  yea i hear you  i m watching because my son wants to see it.
dude  the joke is clearly meant to be cringy coming from the weird uncle. jaime looks up to batman in the comics and the director had to read them before making this.his biggest story involved sending a physical letter to batman so that the enemy couldn t track his message.
every way they could     are you serious  the guy they hate the most is superman. batman has never once being thrown under the bus.
i m guessing you ve never gotten through a lot of dc movies then.
@aggie manga  are we supposed to if they re that cringe
nope. jaime s family knows in the original run of the comics back in 2006  and his two best friends know too.
i d sure love to have a reaction to that batman comment myself  only i won t be as nice and cute about it.
creatv  it s just a damn word relax smh y all take things too damn seriously
it s not that deep  many on both sides are snowflakes! same crowd that says we can t even joke anymore getting mad over this!
thank you!
@melonie mac go boom  that s because melonie is one of a kind.
i get what you re saying. the fact beetle s friends and family seem to be full on up in his business  flying around in whatever that vehicle was and shit. i hate that and like you said it made it look like a disney channel super hero tv show. i guarantee those moments of the movie are going to drag the pace down immensely.and him cutting a bus in half.... guess they re lucky no one was in the middle of the damn thing when it happened. or had a stray leg out in the aisle. lol cripes...
i get your points on the whole  super-hero fam normies  thing.   there s a lot more of it in the shazam films than tom holland s spider-man. but also remember that holland s spider-man lost everything. no friend  no mj  not even aunt may made it.   now he s not even part of the avengers  because they forgot who he is  too. - so hopefully it s get back to a solo spider-man w holland in the mcu moving forward.
it was looking good...but that final line fucking ruined it for me. how the fuck is batman a fascist  mel you look gorgeous as always btw!
are people just now realizing that not everybody s gonna like their favorite superhero
your thoughts on the superhero having to drag their family through a plotline are on point.it s very difficult to keep interested when going from  seeing somebody new to being a superhero  combating fantastical unknown things... to some kid dealing with their family  that they ve dealt with every day of their lives.
jamie the blue beetle likes to go for a walk.a very enthusiastic walk.
my first thought was  oh no! did lara outstay her welcome!
just can t stop workin can ya! lol best way to keep your mind off things. have a great rest of your day  you re the best!
thoughts on the studio making this movie a theatrical release instead of streaming
i am a mess right now  literally totally empty  clean room
how can this cute girl be in her thirties  it looks more like her age has stopped for the last ten years  through melonie magic
i don t know too much about blue beetle but i like what i see so far
jamie  huh    i would have preferred a silver  modern age ted kord blue beetle.  this feels like a marvel-style treatment with the most recent variation.  the jamie reyes reboot in the comics was set to draw a younger crowd with a young protagonist  ala spiderman  anyway  so i m not surprised.
in the context of dceu i can see why some people may see batman as a fascist  more so anyone who grew up under a directorship. the dceu batman is very authoritarian which is a core element of fascism but this alone doesn t make batman a fascist. his reputation is pretty rocky since the death of robin from branding people like we saw in batman vs superman to going full judge  jury and executioner throughout the streets of gotham which is one of the main plot points of batman vs superman. elseworld stories themselves deal with this alot more from the classic dark knight returns which had robocop style tv debates on if batman s return was good for gotham showcasing the two sides where people did refer to him as a fascist to the sequels that dive much more into the idea that batman himself is a fascist. then we have kingdom come depicting an older bruce wayne who s pretty much turned gotham into a police state with robots patrolling the streets and a super computer satellite to monitor everyone within the city.with the dceu batman being heavily based on frank millers i can see why some people may call him a fascist. personally don t mind the use as it s nothing new to batman but it did feel very random at the end lol i think it was dc s way of creating drama with a certain group of people which as worked. but yeah idk i personally didn t care lol
i was never a blue beetle reader but i do know the basic gist of the character and dc really blew it  again. they had the opportunity to introduce a relatively unknown character to unfamiliar audiences but four words have pretty much done away with that. and dc wonders why they re in their current state. gee  i don t why
the batman line killed it for me. i was meh on this from the beginning but that killed any interest i had for it. this is the 3rd time  titans  peacemaker and this  that they ve taken shots at batman and i m over it. i also 100  agree...i miss secret identities. losing that element takes away suspense and excitement from these stories and having friends family with the hero waters the hero down.
you re reaction was 100  my reaction  there was some good stuff  but that end sentence...
hey mel  one of the writers for deadpool 3 is from the she-hulk show.
disney channel original  is probably the best way to describe the aesthetic i ve heard.
blue beetle would have clothing budget issues whenever his suit tears his civilian outfit apart.
ikr!
that s the joke  he isn t v
it worked for furious 15.
haha yup  working hard! and thank you!
@melonie mac go boom  don t mention it!
cute girl that s already a woman old enough for me to call a cougar but even tho i m 21 i d wife no doubt about it lol
@renato reyes  melonie is closer to my age  thirty-eight  although i m starting to think that she might actually be a vampire  or an alien...
or it could just be the point of view of one of those types of dads. know a lot of those.
this was about appealing to the woke
@dean firnatine   okay
if your referring to the whole batman joke both him and superman have literally been called that before it s nothing new jesus christ
@nightlizard1564  no. they have been called that. it s your imagination.
they didn t blow it again  1 joke and y all wanna ruin a movie  this looks awesome  stop being a snowflake
@joseph bernal  stop being leftist.
check out len wein s run from late 80s. it s pretty fun. if you like it  read justice league international  features blue beetle  and the blue beetle title after infinite crisis  but stop before the new 52.
@brown destroyer  literally got called that in both the injustice comics and the movie so clearly it s not just my imagination. on top of that at least i m not getting offended over one fucking joke
dude  then you don t really know the character. i ve read the original run of the comics and i can say you re wrong. pleople just like to feel like they re above others
they re trying to make their own mcu spidey. it won t work though. no normie knows who blue beetle is. it should have been a buddy cop tv show with booster gold.
yes. exactly this. 100
so if it flops will it be renamed to  dung beetle
some of the videos leading up to this said you were still dealing with that stalker. hope the absence of a background didn t have something to do with this. if so  stay safe out there.
for me i can t get around the whole family knowing jaime is blue beetle. it takes away from the usual secret identity struggle.
superheroes with secret identities kind of need to be surrounded by  normies.   not everyone can or wants to be well known superheroes like the avengers.  that  should superheroes be unmasked  angle is the one thing i think they missed in civil war.
seems limiting   very tv with the family mix. same problem with shazam  even though the first movie pulled it mostly off with the 2 main kid characters doing most of the relatable work.
inside the marvel writing room okay  what have you got for us writters  10 56
remember the audience being catered to  family is a major aspect in spanish culture
i dig the new set. it s very clean.don t mind the piece of grass in your hair though.
if you think about it. if this film despite what gunn said about the dcu reboot. if this film is connected to the past films i could see why george lopez character said what he said. i mean if look back at bvs clark kent did write an article about batman for the daily planet and he probably wrote how the lower class of gotham are living in fear of batman even after the scandal of batman branding people and sending them to their deaths in prison. that could possibly be the reason for the  batman is a fascist  comment from george lopez.
wow. i hope this does as well as shazam 2! lol
hey empty room. oh no melonie is no longer a tomb raider fan . looking forward to your take. i saw az. you look beautiful melonie
surprisingly the d d movie wasn t so bad but the blue beetle trailer looks like a cw show
15 05 the real star of the show arrives!
yes it s a distraction to the actual hero s journey. i d say this  it makes it like that being a super human far to normal. these movies are now making it far to common placed.
looks like  bio booster armor guyver  goes disney channel  to riff on something you said at the beginning. the part when he has the first change and the way his friends and family overreact to it looked silly. getting normies involved in anything generally is not a good idea  imo  since out of necessity you have to water down things for them to be able to grok it. which means that fans end up disappointed and upset  and franchises die for it. i think this is why superhero movies are dying if not dead.
dc  could we take the least interesting version of blue beetle and make into a movie  yes we can!
i remember nathan filian saying that s who d he would want to play if he was going to be in a superhero movie. the batman is fascist comment is kinda weird cause in injustice 2  he was quite the batman fanboy. maybe i missed something. not a superhero guy so it really doesn t matter to me. how about that last toho godzilla short film. it s called godzilla vs gigan rex. kinda oldschool  in all the right ways
they need to do a live action mega man mega man x movie
i can wait for this movie
i m still burnt out on super heroes. it hit me around iron man   avengers and i just kinda gave up. i watched the boys first 3 seasons and then gave up. even if stuff is good  i m just so tired of it and have been watching other stuff. i went back and watched the old blade movie and enjoyed that and was comparing that to modern stuff and i really miss some of what made that movie special  granted the cgi is horribly outdated now .
they were originally gonna release it on hbo max  but the studio thought it was really really good and decided to have a theatrical release.
@anthony campos  with all frankness  the studio thinking it s good doesn t really mean much considering the studio in question is wb. same goes for disney.
i thought his family always knew and that he told them
i think the reation to a giant arse bug coming to life as such on your hand wouldnt be  i think it likes me   ..literally everybody would freak out and try to throw it off their hand ..str8 up ..im even good with insects yet my initial reation to a bug that looks freaky one i havent seen but looks dangerous for example  a huhu bug
i was worried that the court awarded all your stuff to the stalker.
you have 3 options for a superhero. 1. hot 2. hideous 3. cool you can also blend those for a 4th option as well.
did she finally set up her tomb raider shrine in another room ! lol
as always  i will wait for reviews from my type of people lol
i agree. family is weakness. any enemy that wasn t comedically dumbed down   as is the case with modern dc marvel franchises  would expolloit that weakness. to great effect  i d imagine. always keep friends and family out of super hero stuff.
i seem to remember from the titans show teaser a couple of years ago  robin was saying   f batman.
the trailer looks great
the tech guy you re talking about in tom s spider man trilogy is ned leeds
i m really gonna miss the snyderverse
it looks fun  despite the batman line. i m worried it s going to be pooped out like shazam though so dceu can move as quickly to the gunnverse as possible
personally i like slice of life type stories with powers  but that means this trailer doesn t appeal to me for not being enough of that sort of genre   p
if the suit murdered the family moments after he put it on  i d see the movie...
hasn t batman had a hand in saving the world many times
they wanted to make a family movie instead of a super heroe movie. it will flop    and not because it looks bad  is because it doesn t look like the kind of movie worth of paying a theater ticket and most people will preffer to wait a month for streaming. just fans of dc will want to watch it when release.
wow  the weirdest thing i ve heard about batman is that he s an anarcho-capitalist  which strangely enough  he might actually be.
3rd tier at best  hero from dc . trailer   from what  i could see   looks okay. it s a mixed bag. mary jane  was supposed to a supermodel from what i could recall . even out doing yardwork  you are beautiful. may god bless you and keep you safe.
this would be a great double-header with naomie.
this trailer definitely rings hollow especially after shazam 2 it looks like just more of what doesn t sell. and they just couldn t help themselves with that batman line. like why did that line just have to make it into this teaser
i used to be hyped for comic book movies. after being burned so many times  i am not even interested. it s like preordering video games  i did it too many times and ended up with turds. i only preorder when i seriously trust the final product  like hogwarts legacy. even then i was still burned by all the diversity characters  and frankly lackluster character choice. at this point it would take a serious apology and open acknowledgment from the companies themselves for me to really give any of it a chance  i am so tired of turning the other cheek to people who hate me for the color of my skin and the genitals i was born with.
and keep reading the same thing over and over  jaime telling his family was a breath of fresh air at the time. it allowed for interesting dynamics that i hadn t seen before. and if i think about  it didn t make too much of a difference. the villains couldn t know who his family is unless he was a psychic and even in that case  he could take that info from him anyway. it wouldn t matter if they knew or not
batman isn t an anarchist that doesn t make sense he has literally fought against anarchy both figuratively in ideology and literally in the villain named anarchy.batman doesn t trust the govt sure but he also doesn t want chaos and in almost all versions one trait is often true among him and that is the fact he is whether he means to be as much of one as he is a control freak.
if iron man  and dragonfly  from superhero movie 2008  had a son  he would be this blue beetle
in my room  oh never mind that alarm. it just goes off when cw plot lines are being recycled in dc films. and welcome back  melonie mac
i wouldn t have thought that there s internet reception in the hyperbolic time chamber.
at least melonie vacuumed the carpet before going on air
good to see you back mel. help me get my twitter back
agree about the normie friends. it s all part of the narrow worldview of woke writers  thinking that no one can identify with the characters unless they are exactly the same as them in every way  i.e. pure narcissism . so the tag-alongs need to be unattractive  obese  slovenly dressed  and incapable of doing anything except pop culture references. it s awful.
the blue bhole is my favorite  i just hope they don t do it dirty. that would hurt
i agree  it should be like 25  of family plus chrematistics and the 75  full blown blue beetle and his enemies.
it looks well produced.  the cgi looks better than anything marvel has put out in a while  but i ll pass due to their political stances.
i m with mel  on this one. when i can stream it at home  i ll enjoy it.
i agree with her  shazam  ms. marvel  and spider-man all had a lot of family involvements and it s becoming stale also this feels like a disney plus tv series rather than a movie after watching this trailer.
i like the spartan approach.
looks ok.  would watch.
oh no  melonie was robbed!
hey melonie how are u doing u look amazing btw god bless u have a great night sis i know ur going through some stuff right now but i m always gonna be here to have ur back and support u
looks like a dc movie with marvel atmosphere. batman line was weird and blue beetle interface is like budget iron man. overall  the movie looks fun and lighthearted. probably a good thing since no one knows who blue beetle is. if i still cared about super hero movies  i d see it
looks good... so far
100 the bad guy has the exact same powers and suit as the hero  just is a bad guy.
tell that to the creator that made him a family man then. his family is involved in the comics and comics not gonna change just because you don t like that his family is involved.
im mexican i liked him in young justice and i want to like this but i just dont know how i feel about the heavy comedic leanings
its not out yet so how do you know
@rooslan65  i don t remember seeing spider-man aunt jumping into a car or a ship to tag team with peter.
@beekeyyy  blue beetle isnt spiderman also just because we ve seen his family in the trailers doesnt mean theyll have the biggest role again wait till the movies out to judge
@rooslan65  true  let s see how it goes.
rofl!
sorry it was me. ill return the items asap
thank you so much
contact me for your reward
we ll have to wait for the movie to come out.
well  i m done with extended universe comic book movies now. never thought i d live to say   screw this  but here we are.
you gotta admit. dc insulting their biggest ip  and it s fanbase for a cheap laugh to get butts in seats is a bold strategy  cotton. let s see if it pays off for em!
looks like a 2000s superhero movie. also you gotta drop batmans name because he is the big name in dc films.
your computer should be on the floor. it would fit better with the overall look of the room.
people care more about sale than review  good story and character make a great movie
who is blue beatle at this point  are they using heroes from mystery men because i d watch a spleen movie!
thumbs up for your cat stealing the scene near the end.
the transformation scene looked pretty amazing...the rest though  seems like cheap tv
lol  melonie said beetle borg lol. great show by the way
not gonna lie was hoping it was going to be able ted korddon t really know the iron beetle character  seems  ok if it wasn t for the annoy fat female friend that is going to be through the whole thing ala shang chi. the kid playing him is good in cobra ki so here s hoping he s great.also criminals would think that batman is a fascist
the vibe seems very spy kids power rangers  on a surface level
mid   girl your room looks mid
i left a comment on az heelvsbabyface about john wick 4 s popularity  and whether hollywood would finally start giving audiences what they wanted. one reply stated that even after top gun maverick s success  if john wick 4 and super mario bros  which i ve heard is based  do well  it will still be unlikely to ditch it s woke agenda. this is highly likely  but time will tell. how much more money are they willing to lose  superhero movie fatigue is also another contributing factor.
they re trying to do the incredible vibe.
you will always be my lara croft.
i don t understand in the slightest how batman is a fascist  but i m intrigued by the film because of xolo  as i am a big fan of  cobra kai.
it s looks like a cw show from where i see it. it reminds of ms marvels which was mid mediocre at best. yeah  i m really not as interested in this new movie. stay safe
what happened to ted kord being blue beetle
the fascist line is meant to be a joke and pleople are reacting to it exactly the way the marketing team wants them to.it s meant to be like the embarrassing things your mom and dad say because they re old.jaime is a big fan of batman.
this could be really good but then comes  whatever you can imagine  i can create  - with those words they have made the interesting character of blue beetle into a  get out of jail free  blue lantern.
you must be living under a rock if you dont know who blue beetle is by now.
jaime has been blue beetle since 2006
apparently decided not to use him because he was a rich white man so they instead decided to go for what most represents the minority  it s clear just by that batman line what they think and were going to do with ted kord  so it s good that the film is about jamie since no one cares about him can destroy his character all they want.
im a jaime fan  that s how i got introduced to blue beetle and as for the batman joke eh idrc it s george lopez isn t that guy meant to say dumb stupid sh t all the time
the marketing team wants people to skip this movie
but that s literally the whole gist of his character is that his suit is basically nano tech. idk why that s such an issue when iron man in infinity war had a similar suit .
beetleborg  takes me back.
if only they went with  batman s a freak!  since  yeah of course not everyone s a fan of batman in the dc world  but  you shouldn t say he s a fascist  . and the only thing that got me going is how practical the suit itself is   not counting the weapons that sprout out  that s cgi of course  very tokusastu inspired.
i won t see it in the movie theater. i might watch it for free at home if it is on tv. but for me that s most things made today. remember to drink water. stay safe. take care. have fun.
after the last line in the trailer i left  might pass the movie
they re scraping the bottom of the superhero barrel if this what they re reduced to making.
im not going to lie it s hard to keep up with what you re getting at.
it does look a bit mid not even gonna lie
for me the biggest thing of course is the batman is a fascist line but funny enough i think the casting is a good choice and the suit looks good.  however  from what little i know about jaime reyes as blue beetle i saw from batman the brave and the bold  his family didnt know about him having the scarab at first and also the scarab is not female.  to me especially with the failure of black adam and shazam 2 this is doa
super.mel watching the trailer is better than the trailer!
i m not going to listen to superhero takes like  batman s a fascist  from the crowd that thinks superhero stories should be about self-aggrandizement and validation rather than  you know  heroism.also  this reminds me of how g4tv asked interviewees  why should we cancel batman  which i can see those folks doing  but why would dc denigrate their number one cashcow  it s like they hate making money lol.
i actually enjoyed the trailer and thought it was good up until that end comment about batman.
feels like a even more child friendly version of power rangers   shame cause the main actor from cobra kai is great
beetleborgs! no wait...max steel! i dunno  first time i see this character.
beetleborg machine  yo  i used to love the beetleborgs man. why can t get a beetleborgs movie  finish off nukus and horribell once and for all. that would be amazing.
i 1000  agree this movie looks less than mid
i love the character   i don t agree with you on this movie being mid and the batman line was from his uncle who doesn t like batman   but i respect your opinion
how is batman a fascist when he s a capitalist and a libertarian
your hair looks super cute
it s like they ve learned nothing and have no desire to do better.
finally someone talks about it!
in the comics his family knowing was like one of the first things he did was tell them
dc also ask their comic applicants why batman is a fascist.
not really. they re using their own characters to start drama and get free publicity from it. you and everyone seems to be doing what they want. that line is not going to put batman in the ground and they know it
@roberto carvajal  that s not the point. it s not a batman film that s at risk of losing money  its this one. having a movie tell people that a character they love is evil is a way to get those people to not watch that film. publicity doesn t count for anything if it doesnt translate to ticket sales. simple as that.
fr  hope our boy miguel is able to work around things and still play a good jaime
u been missin out fam
yeah. the point of the joke is that it s a dumb  uninformed opinion
it s a joke meant to be cringy dude. you re reacting exactly like the marketing team wants your to
melonie hair up is looking good
something is different here but i can t quite place it .
melonie is the most beautiful woman in the world!
i think it looks great and xolo is an amazing actor so i think he will kill it as blue beetle
blue beetle comics came out in 1940 yet a lot of haters saying it s copying ironman  which came out in 1960
how do they know batman is a  fascist . are they aware he s bruce wayne or is he  fascist  because he s tough on crime also most of us latinos don t like george lopez. they gotta stop assuming we do.
problem with dc is all the moves are like one and done  they really don t connect other than a few sec cameos in them  and i think audiences are tired of superheroes movie look at marvel after endgame slowing going down hill
honestly your life is pathetic if one batman joke got you all hurt...that goes for anyone
i loved the trailer. the batman fascist line was stupid yeah. but ya know  stuff like that you can ignore because everything else seems like it s doing the right things. hopefully the whole movie isn t gonna be crapping on bigger name characters. im excited.
batman is not a fascist  he a technocrat. big difference.
reminds me of the power rangers...i like it
blue beetle was a nobody character. i expected it to be lame. the fact that there were moments where he looked badazz was enough of a surprise to make me interested. seeing it in theaters interested  maybe not. i ll wait to see more before i make that decision.
haha!  he looks like the 1990s guyver movie  lol
yeah that last fascist line would be delivered by woke george lopez who is for drag queen shows at kids schools.  smdh.
as a dc fan  i will probably watch this  but it does look very generic. it will probably be a box-office bomb
blue beetle is my favorite . ive gotta disagree with you normally i have a lot of the samw views as you but i think it looks amazing. the suit looks exactly like the comics too the batman is a fascist thing is a freaking joke.  its not the first time hes been called one. both batman and superman have been called a fascist in the comics...a dad whos never met batman and likely only hears of him through the news can totally make it understandable how hed say he was a fascist. when he said batman is a fascist it made me laugh and im against all the woke shit but it really isnt meant to be taken seriously.  it was george fkn lopez saying it  its not that serious
so it s a blue green lantern
when  we re proud to have a latin hero  is the thing they re pushing.. you know it s not gonna be....  just the best...
yeah  i think they should have gone with ted cort and booster gold - not the 2nd blue beetle
if this is gonna be what the rest of the dcu will be like i m out. and no  you don t look like a mess right now. you look pretty like you always do. there i go simping again  i m sorry.
pretty much. but people play into the marketing team s hands
well i m the comics tho he s not the original but holds the mantle now as blue beetle he s also hispanic
you explain it better than most.  normies can drag the super down  or spend too much screen time on boring normie crap instead of super adventure.  you look great  i hope everything is stellar  d.
i have a feeling that they only put the  batman  line in there to start drama. that way when people criticize the trailer they can easily call all of the haters fascists.
they skipped over ted kord- gee wonder why  looks like we know what to expect for booster gold
i m not a super fan of blue beetle  but i know this is the newer recent character to hold the mantle and i m not really a fan of comic book movies that skip over decades of storylines for more recent events.
melonie  i see those disney lay offs hit you hard.
i mean he was called a fascist a lot in the dark knight returns
i love the actor since i watch him in cobra kai so i may have to check it out may i have to see a bit more.but i m confused by the line that batman is a fascist isn t batman dc
i loved the trailer. the batman line was the last thing on my mind.
i was about to say laura croft disappeared lol
anything with george lopez is going to be a woke mess anyway.  conveniently enough he s the one who called batman a fascist.
i guess they are trying to reset their universe now and have bb be the ironman of dc    i mean i like the character but eh  we shall see
what in the hell did i just witnessed
i m hispanic american  that said  when i hear the phrase   batman is fascist!  i cringe . but hey it s just george lopez being himself  this movie will probably do well  because of the marketing to the latino demographic. right now i probably will wait to stream
looks better than mid  but lopez s line was stupid about  batman being a fascist
the visual effects are better than disney......
fyi  hey  sis. love your videos. but  the song   born a rockstar   that you use for your outro . . . when you click on the song link you have in your video descriptions for the song  it leads you to an anime video version of the song that features a lesbian kissing scene in it @0 41 in the video. with you being a fellow christian  i just thought you should know that so you can pick a song link to the song that has an album cover thumbnailed version of the song video like it used to be.  theyswitchedituponyouonthesly just looking out. we ve got to be vigilant.  1 peter 5 8  god bless.
she doesnt like humans in a super hero movie confirmed lol jk i just see it as long as they dont dumb down the family id be fine
they bring in the normie family for comic relief. it is so cliche and overdone.
i seriously didn t know they were making blue beetle until today. from what i ve seen it s probably gonna suck
it looks like a combination of iron man  power rangers  2017   spider-man homecoming  with some  la familia  sitcom mixed in. ehh...i ll check it out when it s streaming somewhere for free. i don t feel the incentive to watch a movie that won t matter in the scheme of things within dc. the only dc movie i want to watch immediately is the flash movie  yo ho ho    and that s only because multiple batman are in it.edit...after hearing melonie s take i miss secret identities as well. that made things more interesting. balancing their personal life with their heroic life and trying to prevent the two from crossing. later  the superhero would have to reluctantly let other people come into the dangerous world. not bring them into the mix from the beginning. ever since iron man it s like superheroes decided to ditch the secret identity aspect of superheroes. ditching it works for iron man  but it s not something for every superhero to disregard.
yep. and pleople are doing exactly what they wanted
which is either  elseworlds  or the far future depending on how you choose to look at it. that s also in a comic that was interesting in itself and written when i had faith that dc could make good stories. none of that applies to this trailer. my interest went from  low to nonexistent.
@john  true but that line in the trailer has no context yet and we don t know how good movie is so let s not make any quick assumptions although it s probably gonna be bad but who really knows i m just saying we don t need another boy who cried woke situation because that already happened with dungeons and dragons
the music is from the youtube royalty free library  i have no control over what fan made anime trailers people make with it nor is it my song lol!
isn t the whole superhero genre a big cliche already at this point everything  new  that superhero movies try will be seen as cliche. there s no winninghere s a secret  nothing is new. every  new  movie is just a different mix of stuff that s come before that we haven t seen. people just choose what to call new and what to call cliche  but everything can be traced back to something.try to have fun
mid  to each their opinion but i m looking forward to it. i just hope they keep him immature and funny.
not so fun fact  the same shareholders that own disney own warner bros and even sony. i couldn t careless about superhero movies anymore. i just don t want warner bros to interject in villenueve s dune 2. thats all i care about now.
having his family going on adventures with him tells me that there s absolutely nothing at stake in this movie.
definitely should have left it on hbomax
thanks!
i m not watching anything that degrades the good name of the greatest superhero of all time.  greatest top 3 anywho.
that trailer was so good  but then they called batman a fascist out of nowhere  the definition of a fascist is often capitalized  a political philosophy  movement  or regime  such as that of the fascisti  that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader  severe economic and social regimentation  and forcible suppression of opposition. if you re a batman fan  you know that calling batman a fascist couldn t be farther from the truth  that word was so uncalled for
i don t care for blue beetle but the trailer looks good
imagine being this offended and this sensitive over a throw away joke the writers didn t even think twice about
oh no  someone tooked all melonie s stuffs!
trailer was not bad  but that last line was so stupid. why would you end your marketing piece by disrespecting one of your most popular characters
i wouldn t bet the farm on this  but i have to wonder if they put that batman comment in there to see how people react.  we live in a world where the inmates are running the asylum.  and the inmates we currently have can t even do that without making a giant mess of it right now.  all that to say  it s an idiotic statement  so a looney-toon idiot is the one who probably came up with it just for that reason.they probably did it because they know us horrid ist and cist and list and wist and wish and what and whoever will stand up and defend the dark knight from such an idiotic comment.  free publicity for the blue beetle movie.  surely nobody in the blue purple hair world is crazy enough to deliberately attack batman.
i think  jarring  is a very misused word  especially in this situation and melonie says  normie  way to much for an adult woman here! i mean it s almost drinking game worthy!
blue beetle suit looks like it s trying to rip off iron man from the mcu. mixed with some elements of spider man from avengers infinity war. pretty much was the only thing i thought of when i saw that first trailer. lol
every single reaction i watched  and i probably watched over 20  every single person laughed  on the whole  batman is a fascist  thing   not to mention every person loved this trailer. this reaction was a bit too much   and too long . not that serious. still  to each their own. the movie looks great!
except for batman related ones superhero movies are becoming bargain bin specials at this point. like the pile of dvds and blurays for like 5 bucks you d see at the entrance of jb hi fi
dc trying to be marvel again!!
good lord melanie is so beautiful
i ve always liked blue beetle and i m glad he s finally getting recognition on the big screen. idk about everyone else but the batman line didn t bother me
blue beetle will do just about as well as shazam 2
did u read the comics
thank you!
to get people talking about it
pretty sure it was just a joke
me neither. is a non-issue. i mean he was branding people in batman vs superman. we have to remember he has a bad reputation  great street credit but bad reputation with the everyday citizen.
@hominus nocturna  as someone who didnt watch those movies  having this as context makes a whole lot of sense as to why batman is being called a fascist.
@sweetroll dealer  my man  the way denzel washington says it .
@hominus nocturna  sure  but the fascist line still doesn t make sense in that context either. fascism is a very specific type of socialist ideology  it d be like calling him a commie  it s utterly absurd and irrational.now  if they d refer to him as a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands  then it d closer capture why people are wary of him. even calling him a criminal would ve made more sense.
@animavox  it will be hilarious if george lopez keeps saying  batman is a fascist  throughout the movie and then in a post credit scene he encounters batman.
@hominus nocturna  ngl i would love if the post credits scene is him getting assaulted by two thugs then batman appears as a shadowy figure and saves himit would be hilarious
@safer ren  yes!
wait a second one already came out
it looked like it might be fun before the batman diss. but honestly  didn t we already get kid turns into superhero with shazam it s only a cute concept when it s unique. but this is in the same universe  right  or is everything getting redone now i can t wait for the dozens of  its all about family  interviews.
i m not a big fan of this new blue beetle movie or dc character and so i just want to say that i don t really know bout the new movie except it has george lopez in the movie and i think it would be a great movie if they had george lopez playing the blue beetle character bc he is a funny guy and actor and he would make a terrific jokes on the movie which no actor could do and so i just want to say that they need to make george lopez be the blue beetle instead of the mexican actor who i don t really know very well and not seen on the television shows or the movies  ok melonie. anyway i just wanted to tell you bout the blue beetle new dc movie that is going to be coming out to theaters this year or next year  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good nite too melonie. also have a great week too.
batman is a fascist and i m out.
i agree with the  too many people know the secret identity  aspect.  it s in the name of the genre.  super hero  singular .
come on  jaime s blue beetle story has involved his family from the beginning. and now that we get a superhero movie that s somewhat different because it involves other aspects of the character s life  it s not conventional enough.we have enough spider-man  batman  superman  iron man  thor  wonder woman  x-men and captain america movies. i love them too  but come oooooon.it s just so disapointing that many people don t look for something new even within a genre that is already so repetitive.
batman is a fascist yeah... these people will not get a dime of my family s money...
based on all of the easter eggs  i m assuming ted kord is dead. not a fan of that. the costume and fx look good in general. that batman is a fascist line is a huge buzz kill though. no thanks.
hate to break it to you melonie  but i think someone stole your room.
me  okay no buzz words so far...trailer   batman s a fascist me  okay there s my woke bingo cardi hope that s a satire joke in the end  it was unnecessary but okay
the whole point of the last line was a joke and clearly a call back to the 50s attack on the comic book industry claiming both batman and superman are fascists. they re clearly poking fun at that. that said  the movie looks like a lot of fun!
i wouldn t say batman is 100  fascist  but he does have fascist tendencies. for example  brother eye and the shit he did in the dark knight film with cell phones locking in to all the cell signals of gotham city is a fascist statement.
since when was blue beetle rich
jaimi reyes  family knows about his super hero identity. idk how involved they actually are though but he s a kid so they are involved to some degree. and they live in el paso so i imagine that s where this movie takes place. wait i m sorry but are you saying that only conventionally attractive people should be able to appear in super hero films  that s dumb.
was that a dig at affleck
bruh jamie loves his family dude. it s one of the best aspects of his character where he cares about family values. that s why he struggles to keep his work life balance. one of the central struggles is him and his father s relationship. it s why he hates and clashes with damian wayne  like most of us  cause he left and hates his family. it s through his values that he builds a relationship with the scarab.
to me the trailer looked fine and maybe even promising until that fascist bit  that is so unnecessary.
they re going on the family a bit to hard jaime as the blue beetle is supposed to be an inner struggle cause the scarab is a annhilation alien machine it was supposed to take over him but it got damage allowing jaime to maintain control but it s a constant struggle that causes him to have to be a loner at times and figure things out on his own it wasn t handed to him the scarab found him at the wrong place wrong time it s more supposed to be a curse for him that he has to keep control of the scarab doesn t care about human life it has no problem wiping humans out and when it takes control there are times when jaime has to pull it back from killing he can t remove it cause it s grafted to his spine eventually the more he wears it the more it tries to stay on him my guess their not going to do that which sucks blue beetle was really great character in the beginning
people who are mad at the batman comment  just learn how to take a joke. it s just an opinion of jaime s uncle on baman  doesn t mean it s a fact. plus  i heard blue beetle is set in the new dcu so it s better if we watch it to know the full story
if this is the first time you ve heard the batman is a fascist perspective you don t follow enough batman.it s usually said within the movies. thomas wayne is viewed as a fascist and he s the son of somebody widely viewed as a fascist. it s not out of the realm of possibility
and spider-man was the genius not the kid next to him.
same. i was kinda excited about it for a bit... then they dropped that line and i completely lost all the interest.
we have to remember that batman has a bad reputation  great street credit but bad reputation with the everyday citizen. i mean  he was branding people after all.
same
@hominus nocturna  batman doesn t brand people. you re going off a specific version of him that most didn t do. you re trying to justify making a political statement against batman when the guy is a huge reason they have a little more safe space and a little less worry
@lifeofnate  is a political statement  didn t know. but batman was branding criminals in batman vs superman  in that movie he was considered a psychopath  even.
but why would they call him that  is just because bruce wayne is rich
@lewis from spain  comedy relief.
@hominus nocturna  but you see  i didn t even thought that they were trying to be funny.  and reading other comments nobody took it as a joke. it looks more like an statement.  but seeing the annoying family scenes trying to be funny  it could be.
yup
@lewis from spain  yep. many forget in the dc universe batman is considered to be many things by different people. it will be hilarious if george lopez character keep saying  batman is a fascist  and then in a post credit scene he encounters batman.
in the comics his family knows and is pretty involved with him
immediately  when i saw this tram  like all people are going to get mad at batman being called a fascist even though people love the dark knight returns  and in that comic he is called a fascist a lot
someone who gets it
did you read the new 52 run or the original one before that  i see many people here who read the new 52 run and think they know everything but don t know that wasn t his first story.the original run had jaime being helped by friends and family.
@roberto carvajal  his debut was infinite crisis then had a solo by keith giffen same writer that did the new 52 run and 90s lobo but still the movie looks like they re going to hard on the family there s no uncle there just his mom dad and sister and his friends paco and brenda that s it also the scarab wasn t handed to him in freaking burger box he found it and the scarab activated and burrowed into his back the scarab is a curse of jaimes and the movies going to treat it like a toy
@jackratscratpack  you missed the fact that the scarab is supposed to sound like a screeching voice  not siri. dude  relax. just because i don t mention the small details doesn t mean i don t know about them.i ve been waiting for this movie for more than ten years ever since i saw that first test footage for smallville before it ended up looking so horrible in the actual show. don t be one of those fans who still complain about comicbook accuracy.people just don t get screenwriting. movies have to choose a theme and commit to it. make changes that make the movie stand out among others in the genre. that involves changes that benefit the story but respect the escense of the character. into the spider-verse  possibly one of the best and most creative superhero movies ever  has miles meeting ganke in highschool  when they re supposed to be childhood best friends in the comics.i m glad we have an added uncle instead of something like jaime being an orphan just to make the movie gritty. i m glad the movie will treat the scarab as a toy  possibly giving us fun and new interactions before it is taken seriously  instead of saying it was created by the government or something dumb like that. sure he got the scarab in a burger box  but that transformation looked as horrifying as i ve always thought it should.remember that in the new 52  written by tony bedard with assistance by griffen  paco was a stereotypical dropout thug  jaime had the hots for brenda and he ran away from home instead of having his family help him figure out things. would you rather have something like that  i mean it would be more  faithful  to the comics right  a correction  griffen didn t assist bedard  i tried to refresh my memory and turns out he just wrote the plot for the zero issue during new 52. nothing else
most don t know it s kind of a throwback joke as well since both batman and superman have been labeled that all throughout but idk ppl are weird and take things way too deep to heartb
that batman line turn me off completely.  was not sure about watching it  but now i know for sure that i ll skip it
i am not familiar with blue beetle at all  so i don t know how accurate this is  but the suit is basically an iron man suit  with bug wings. it looks the same  it has lights  similar shaped face plate  ai in the suit  etc. basically a knock off iron man.
batman is a fascist.  playing with fire there dc. for now  i will see it as a joke. but if you are serious  hoh boy!also  who robbed you melonie  we ll track em down!
looks like they went shazam like humor.
guys let s not be like sjw s don t automatically trash it just cuz the uncle looking dude said that about batman. to me it sounds like it was delivered like it was meant to be a joke like something not to take seriously. other than that i think this movies gonna be awesome.
take a shot every time melo says normie
lots of karen snowflakes offended by jokes  i thought we were supposed to be tough and not cancel things
i think you got it wrong on this one. one of the reasons superhero movies are losing excitement is because the stories and settings became too grand and detached from our real world. having  normie  characters brings the storyline back down to earth and makes the plot relatable. aliens  random planets  multiverses  masses of robotic alien enemies is boring and out there to connect with. origin stories tend to be more beloved because they keep everything relatable.
dc still attacks the superhero that basically builds the company  why not iron man  the most direct rival of batman maybe  or maybe spider-man  cause  you know  beetles and spiders are insects . but why is dc still dog-pilling his own superhero  his own creation goes beyond me! the trailer looks good  but that  family troop  thing looks more like a 90 s thing  and look at what happened to shazam! 2. for the first one worked  but the second did not. superhero movies are not  family films . yes  the whole family can watch it  if not r rated  but is not a  family film  category.
they had to end it in the most stupidest and woke way possible otherwise it would probably make some money and disney does not want to do that god forbids.
your logic is flawed. i agree that the superheroes should keep their superhero identity secret but that absolutely never happens in any film. there is more  normy  characters involved in spider-man s adventures then probably any hero i can think of. i personally don t like that the shazam family was introduced already. hell  even april o neil eventually learns martial arts and starts fighting alongside the turtles in animation  comics and film. as for blue beetle  the film looks pretty damn accurate to the book. hey not everything is for everyone. i for one will be taking the kids to enjoy it for what it is.
you do realize peter was a child  ofc he was gonna have help . and this is the same shi in the comics if yall would pick up a book before u complain youd know. literally the whole point of including friends   family is to show the balance of both of the characters lives
i m curious who thought the batman is a fascist joke was funny  i did not and think it s a stupid narrative to even push. you hear about companies like g4 interviewing people and asking the question for a job interview why batman should be cancelled  bizarre stuff .
looks straight up abysmal
i don t know a lot about blue beetle  but... the batman joke  i felt it was out of place. will i watch it  meh maybe. it s kinda accurate
you are talking about yard work  while i am buried under several feet of snow still.
hey  melmac boomer. i m sending you good vibes from my little corner of the globe.
blue  battle trailer     normalies vs models  isn t batman!
kitty at the end made up for the whitespace in the background.
is lara going back in there  15 19
it s just a joke my guy. told by the weird uncle  meant to be cringy
@roberto carvajal  the director himself said that it was not a throwaway line.  he want to play stupid game  he will win stupid prize
@gary nadeau  you sure are gonna show him buddy.out of curiosity which batman comics have you read  you seem to know a lot about him.
actually that s not accurate i can assure you. he s nothing like ironman and if anything ironman is a knockoff batman let s be real here lol. bb is a kid with alien tech literally bonded to him  allows him to form his own weapons  is blue  always attached to him and has an entirely different backstory  he s also not rich at all but the opposite if anything. tony has a fake heart  always needs to upgrade his suits and has the same memo as batman  rich playboy  smart  billionaire by day. crime fighter by night  secret identity etc  etc. jaime isn t even the first blue beetle keep in mind.
typical mainstream audience fan. well if you read comics or watched cartoons you d know it isn t just a knock off of iron man. there s been 3 blue beetles dan garret ted kord and jaime rayes. blue beetle has been around i m comics for decades.
@sean obrien  lol exactly. jaime isn t even the first bb. like you can tell the normie comments from the people who ve read the comics and those who haven t. i saw the same thing with black adam with fate and atom smasher people saying  oh this guy is a doctor strange ripoff  that guy is an antman ripoff  not realized the former were out long before the marvel versions.
@mkf30  i don t like calling people normies  but i agree that a lot of them speak like they have all the knowledge necessary to make definitive statements. many have been saying that jaime doesn t tell his family  but even his grandma knows in the original run.and for the guy who commented originally  jaime s blue beetle was created two years before iron man was released and before that signature look became iconic.
@sean obrien kord and garret didn t have an iron man style suit  so their existence doesn t change the fact that this version appears to be a copy of iron man  powers wise.
@roberto carvajal  yeah i hear what you re saying but to be fair your post is why people refer to them as normies because they go based off of a few mcu films they see then assume  oh dc is just ripping marvel off  which is ironic since typically its the other way around historically speaking lol but i hear what you re saying.

sadly it appears us americans have gone pretty soft and can t handle jokes
someone who gets it. thank you
did u read any comics about blue beetle or jaimes version of bb
sadly not many people here know about blue beetle or jaimes version of blue beetle and it shows
i moved from minneapolis to texas a few years ago  now laughing at all my buddies back home whining about the snow this week
did you make it out to megacon orlando
that is the most gorgeous mess i have ever seen
she can get it
many continue to fall for the social media bait to give publicity to movies!
melonie you need to get on the whatever podcast.
that batman fascist thing is a wtf but it looks so cool ugh
i m gonna be honest here but who the heck is blue beetle  this just goes to show everyone i m not a comic book nerd.
blatant simp comment  hair-up melonie is extra pretty
melonie  why your room empty did you move or something
i think the only whyteperson jn this movie is the villain
i don t care about blue beetle but i ll never miss a chance to be pointed at and told  go boom
it looks alright. the batman line was stupid. xolo does cobra kai so im hoping the actuon scenes actually have some weight to them. other than that looks mid as can be
it has a bit of a nickelodeon vibe about it. not really what i want to see from dc.
spoilers for shazam fury of the gods
this isn t blue beetle. in the comics he was a billionaire industrialist sort of like tony stark. looks like they rebooted him to be miles morales for some reason
this has been done before. there s absolutely nothing new here. i got shazam meets spy kids vibes.
for a second i thought i was watching somebody else. lol
this movie will do well  in mexico.
melonie should have review secret invasion trailer 2 instead.
this  trailer  which ok  i understand they re wanting to branch out to different characters but i still thought  it was underwhelming.
i know right
no worries i didn t know who he was either til i watched batman brave and the bold
@renato reyes i m not much of a comic book guy. i do more gaming   and know more lore from games then comic book.
ted died during infinite crisis and jaime was introduced way before miles morales in the comics.
u gotta catch up on the comics there s been about 3 blue beetles now and if i m correct jaime  shown in the trailer  is the 3rd one and ofc is a kid and happens to be hispanic
@renato reyes  yeah what they ve done here is try to create their own clumsy version of spiderman. all that s missing is someone to say  with great beetle powers comes...
@purefoldnz  no blue beetle was created about 18 years before spider man
@purefoldnz  make that about 21 years actually
@renato reyes  not this version of blue beetle you dolt lol
@renato reyes  the jaime reyes   blue beetle reboot came out in 2006. so not quite 21 years lmao.
so you re a blue beetle fan i assume
@renato reyes  never heard of him until a week ago.
...keep thinking of the tick...
having tick flashbacks
sounds like a peacemaker like joke
the batman line was funny. i don t think these writers actually think that. i don t like the voice of the scarab
why this movie looking like a spy kids spinoff
but yeah i understand the normie part... i still prefer the og spider man. and yes! the batman world  hook you
i m watching this film by any other means except giving these corporations money.  especially when the director gloats online about the whole  batman is fascist  comment. oh  my job is done  gif he pulled out smh
i m so f  king tired of orchestra remixed rap songs being on every trailer....
i m just over superhero movies at this point. might watch guardians of the galaxy 3 for the music though.
it looked good until i heard them call batman fascist.
is this a bad time to tell melonie she was robbed   jkis this blue beetle a reference to roberto bola os   el chapul n colorado   the red grasshopper   if it is  poor chespirito...
i totally don t care about this. even though i like the main actor.
blue dung beetle     p
i bet that line was ad libbed and the director liked it. dc can t help but attempt to ruin batman.
did you nuke your room  cause i think i need to clean now.....
you couldn t pay me to watch anything with george lopez. hard pass .
george lopez saying batman is a fascist doesn t surprise me...
so they stitched together a bad movie using the worst parts of shazam  guardians of the galaxy  and ms. marvel. got it
i agree
people just have something to say to the extent of raging off on jokes. kinda reminds me of some people.
no
warner getting woke
they can make jokes about batman all they want. batman and batman related comics have been saving dc s ass on the comic book front for years now.
melonie threw out all her furniture because a gay person touched it
you call batman a facist  i don t watch your movie. that s just how it is.
they just can t help themselves. i lost all interest in the last ten seconds
kwasade for the algorithm.
the whole trailer was terrible why are people just focusing on the last line
it was clearly a joke. people will be offended by anything these days.
he s handed the thing for no reason  the family scenes are annoying and not funny at all  he s like stupid and only puts weird faces.... and he doesn t always land on his feet  at least not in cobra kai   lol
never really cared for blue beetle but now so excited i will not be seeing this movie
i m from brazil and i m not eager to see bruna marquezine  the ex of neymar jr  in a latin ironman 1 remake...
its spy kids with a blue beetle skin for one of the characters
the batman line didn t really bother me. i m guessing his character is suppose to be dumb. not sure why george lopez is in this though
when will these stupid companies realize the antifa crowd doesn t pay for anything  i m gonna watch it bc i m a fan of the star and like the character  but this looks like it s going to be stereotypical as hell. the entire extended family living in the house  really
everybody really is freaking out about that one sarcastic quip about batman  jeez. it s a joke  laugh and move on.
watched trailer  seemed ok but not hardcore enough for me.
remember star kid
did you enjoy  cocaine bear ! !
yeah. and people still think a joke meant to be cringy is going to ruin dc
but his character deals with family so the complaint is a  little weird. not every superhero is supposed to be like spider man hiding his identity from everyone. but probably not your cup of tea
i m familiar with the blue beetle from injustice. isn t he supposed to be black  or am i tripping
ppl jst take everything to heart nowadays
yeah pretty much his uncle doesn t like batman never knew why didn t read too much about the comics
but glad not everyone takes everything so serious and a previous commented commented that it was probably a joke to reference to what was said before in the comics but i m not that ancient so i wouldn t know lol
sadly not everyone can handle a joke
in young justice he s hispanic  might depend on which blue beetle it is.
@xaforn  right on. either way  i think mel was being too nice. after watching it myself  it looks lame. i ll red box it though.
bb has never been black. the third and last one is hispanic
@roberto carvajal  i see  could have sworn he sounded black in injustice. must have been my imagination.
@vincent werts  i ve seen the injustice intros and he does kinda sound stereotypically black there. don t know why
marvel must be so jealous that dc got to make the first latino superhero movie before them
ya ll care wayyyyyyy too much
midsome
shes kind of hawt
its the same formula over and over with these superhero movies  we have teens that accidentally got powers they re weren t ready for  acts stupid and irresponsible but it s ok cos they are just teenagers  accept they powers  saved the world the movie ends... nothing but cringe dialogue and stale lame jokes with weak plot and bad cgi  either that or they give us super boss genius know it all  women power bs that makes men look stupid. very rare we gon get good movies like john wick and top gun.
i agree  it s the same formula and it s gotten boring.
godzilla is my favorite superhero
yes don t copyright melonie
starting to notice a patter w this yt girl always bashing on poc centered heroes and characters
i only know blue beetle from the injustice games  and honestly  he s not that interesting there. this trailer isn t selling it for me as well. also you just know they fastracked this movie because it s a smorgasbord of  muh divursity  in each scene. just... no thanks dc.
i honestly have no desire to watch blue beetle in cinemas. even though i like both george lopez and the actor who plays miguel in karate kid. i just don t see this film being any good at all. lol
it looks like another comic book super hero movie.don t buy these  and they will stop making them.vote with your dollar.
room...where where room !
also wtf is the deal with him getting the scarab from a fucking happy meal
besides the whole fascist thing  this looks like iron man meets predator.
what happened to your studio  0 52
ironman  warmachine  blue beetle  hellbat  cyborg all favorite mechs. i was happy till i saw that bullshit about batman....
big bad beetle borgs
that woke comment by lopez just put a big no way on this movie for me. i honestly did not even like the trailer up to that point because some of the dialogue seemed cringe and some scenes seemed so derivative of ironman  typical because hollywood has no creativity and cannot think of anything new.
i thought miles morales was latino or something
blue beatle is supposed to be a police officer with egyptian powers not a blue iron man costume. if this is for kids why does the character have big sword that is for decapitating things
godzilla is a baller.
just like the namor and aquaman situation blue beetle was first then came iron man
changing some things  but it s gonna be a boring background for a bit in the meantime
it was a show from the 90 s
@melonie mac go boom oh i remember.  even as a kid bbbb annoyed me lol
uhh jaime reyes  blue beetle was created two years before the iron man movie was released... you just consume what the general population does
you haven t been reading comics for a loooong time have you
@roberto carvajal  no one read blue beatle especially reyes one.
@amoneywilson  yeah you re not making much sense. why say bb is supposed to be a police officer then   by the way  he s an archeologist  son of a police officer  you clearly don t know the character so if no one read it  then who s gonna complain get out of my lawn you kids. i got to go back to eat my porridge and read dan garrett blue beetle comics from the 40s  not even ted kord bb from the 60s  70s or 80s.and by the way  that costume came out two years before iron man became iconic with the movie. you know... the marvel character who also no one cared about before the mcu
@roberto carvajal  the original run. he was police officer. sorry kid.
is that george lopez
oh my oh my god
wha.......what happened to all your cool stuff!
remember dc asking their applicants  why batman is a fascist .
well one more dc movie to skip.
the trailer was really cringe in my opinion  i love the actor who plays miguel from cobra kai. but the movie looked mid
why do people take the fascist joke so seriously jesus

have you seen how poor lily gao is being attacked and deleted all her insta posts except the one attacking white people
i m tired of batman slander. and coming from wb is cringe
why copyright a trailer !
your title is now irrelevant
melony simps........unite!!
it s really hard to trust dc or marvel anymore. too many woke  sucky movies lately.
another dumpster disaster!
facism isn t bad if it s your group in charge
wow. u have really neat tattoos.
i m surprised they didn t say batman was secretly trans gay pandora sexually bi .even before he said batman was a facist..the trailer wasn t that great. probably pass on this.
i really do not care about marvel and dc. they are going woke and i wish for them to go broke.
wasn t blue beetle black
yup.
man i used to love george lopez before tds hit him in the head
@james h u r l e y  i love you using a buzz word to deflect criticism man just like the woke folks
that s g4 tv asking that.
@thatharvguy there s also dc comics division.
@norman readdis  hang on  dc comics actually did that  their  1 selling character book and they re pulling that shit  w t f
@thatharvguy yeah they love disrespecting their legacy characters now. its shows in their modern comics with vita ayala alone. lol
still gonna watch it cuz i wanna help support my boy miguel  now known as jaime  to succeed and maybe land other bigger roles
it s so dumb but happens  sadly
no never
nope
never at all
that trailer was . get outta town.
the comic wasn t that good  way to busy pushing  the message   so as for being close to the  lore   there wasn t much to work with in the first place  but it looks boring  like arrowverse lite.
new room
meep
dc really is tryjng to ruin batman. the trailer was decent enough without the cheap shit.
what s the point of doing a reaction video if you can t show people what you re reacting to  i m not going on their channel to give them views.
have to agree the movie looks mid lol the family part is really annoying. what is this fast x
i dont know anything about the comic book character  but this trailer looks bad. it looks like the ryan reynolds green lantern movie.
i wish i could say hi
nice try. i guess.
to much george lopez!!!!!!!!!
oh my! you let marie kondo into your house! and on topic for the vid  i have zero interest in blue bug.
blue beetle equal cringe failure
it looks too generic  aside from a few cool shots. the family getting involved feels way too marvel and really trying to pander to the latin american community cause they do value family and extended family more then other demographics. there isn t a interesting angle to this  it s just someone who gives the character something trying to hide it from shady forces  character bonds with thing and shady group tries to attack him and take thing from him.
all of the dc super heroes are going to be destroyed
hating for clicks and views is truly insane.
i am looking over the fascist comment  this trailer heat
apparently the director thinks the batman line is hilarious. watch your box office  pal. ripping on fans is not smart.
young justice blue beetle is better. also he didn t want his family know about his powers because of the villains. him becoming blue beetle in front of his family is dumb. they re pretty much just copying holland s spider-man trilogy and it sucks because this kid is good in cobra kai.
george lopez hasn t been likable since the 2000s
that s latino culture. family is a huge part. you don t think superhero movies pander to white culture
in the comics it s the same thing his family knows and they re involved now it might be exaggerated a bit in the movie
dude  he probably thinks it s hilarious because he knows it s not true. i m a big spiderman fan and if someone calls him a saint wanna be i d probably laugh because it would seem that way.besides  the joke is clearly meant to be cringy coming from the weird uncle. jaime looks up to batman in the comics and the director had to read them before making this.his biggest story involved sending a physical letter to batman so that the enemy couldn t track his message.
you clearly didn t read the original run of jaime s blue beetle from 2006. people just speak thinking they know everything
in the comics one of the first things he does is literally tell his family  plus he s hispanic and us hispanics are very close with family
it looks worse than mid  it looks cw
bro if you don t like it just don t watch it we don t want to hear you complain about it jeez
algorithm
that trailer looked like a mediocre cw show at best  then that line just ruined it and let me know what to expect if i go see it. hard pass!
can you say iron man anyone
the promotion of batman being called a  fascist  is more upsetting then the normie family. c mon wb that type of dialogue is disney garbage!
batmans a fascist
did u just say kirsten d is hotter than zendaya   lmao.. also do u think u said  normie  enough times ! but yea is batman a fascist   no
mid  mid what  mild  looks awful.
commenting to feed the algorithm
that  batman is a fascist  comment really pissed me off. these woke arse-holes just can t help themselves  they have to virtue-signal  even if it means trashing one of their most beloved characters. disgusting.
saying this looks mid is generous. the batman is a fascist line told me all i need to know about this movie not to mention that horrendous cgi
normies
that trailer looks outright bad.
the trailer was mid and then the  fascist  comment happened. i hope this movie fails miserably. i m sure it will. they just cannot help themselves with their weirdo agendas and throwing beloved characters under the bus. it s baffling.
i was sold on the trailer until georgie made that stupid batman comment at the tail end
the cgi looks pretty trash  that iron man hud knockoff is atrocious.
personally i have stopped watching any movie produced by hollyweird. life is to short to waste it by watching trash. i rather do something else with my time.
watched the trailer  looks boringly mid n as a latino  i have a feeling their gonna push some latinx bs
did you get robbed   p
yet you re here complaining about the video. it s almost like  being a hypocrite or something...
@cc afo   i m
jaime s blue beetle was created two years before iron man was released and became iconic. people forget that iron man was as well known as blue beetle is
i have a question who was first namor the submariner or aquaman   2nd question who do you think was first first blue beetle or iron man
same.
@roberto carvajal  its already been addressed and confirmed that the line is more than just a throw away line or joke in the movie and the director himself has already been out on twitter mocking people who weren t happy with the line that should tell you enough lol. you proclaiming this and that in the comics and the director had to read all the comics is nonsense does it help if the director reads the comics yes but dc and marvel clearly don t make that mandatory sure these people now days love to actively ignore the source material .this movie has flop written all over it sorry to disappoint you
@celtictiger  i m fine  good or bad i got to see what the suit looks like in live action. i ve waited enough for this to understand it s not going to be everything i wanted. you re the one who seems to be easily offended by one line. no wonder we re called snowflakes. and all i m saying is they want people to make a fuss about that line because that s what a marketing team does. it s no coincidence it s on the trailer and at the end no less. and you re reacting exactly how they want you to.
seems sum pplcan t handle a joke also jst a side note it s been joked around in previous times from older comics and so on
@renato reyes  well it wasn t funny and felt very tacked on  so
doubt it  plus looks pretty accurate to the comics if ofc you ve actually read them
even if batman was fascist  wich he s not  why do they feel compelled to make the comment in the movie...
i get sick of the friend that knows everything about the hero and tells everybody. they always do stupid thing. spider-man had a movie with dumb friend the fat asian guy.
ur mid
why does the trailer look like a cw show   this is supposed to be a film!  the batman comment  while not surprising  was a big nope.  this will flop at cinemas  no normies know who this is and the ones that know batman will just be like this is woke trash.
annnd with that parting batman comment they have spared me putting this on the list of movies to watch!
but how can batman be a fascist  he supported blm!
it s batman a facist  cool  not watching it. thanks trailer.
looks like a 90 s movie in a bad way like shaq s steel. and i was excited for it. it looks like they should have kept it for hbo max
do you have a snapchat
it looks cool but calling batman a fascist was a big turn down for me.
looks generic af. nothing we haven t seen before. and looks like they taking notes from mcu on how to write cringe jokes. great.
no thanks. that  batman s a facist  line just turned me off towards the whole thing.
the whole  family  thing turned me off even more than the batman comment.
just your daily liberal saying batman s fascist because he s rich
he is a democrat. makes sense.
methamphetamine is not funny.
at the end of the day. could they just stop with the work shit. it s old and tired some. if the movie is shit then let it be shit. they need to stop pandering. i was kinda into the trailer. mind you i only know about blue beetle because of injustice. but when they show george and he says batman s a fascist. i checked out and said nah. i m good. y all have fun spending your money on this movie. i ll wait to a family or fiend has the movie and i ll just watch it from them.
it looked interesting until the  batman is a fascist  line  then it lost me   i m sorry but don t insert your own narrative
this was trash from the music  i m 29  to the whole vibe it s just another cgi fest movie   the icing on top with  batman is fascist  was just alright i m done. i ve been done for years but still funny to watch them burn their own money   keep going with it.
bad acting
cuz it s a joke that s been used around a lot even from the earlier days which i m assuming was meant to be taken as a joke but ppl are shoving it so deep in their lil hearts dey can t realize it s more than likely a joke after all both supes nd the bat have been called that time after time as a joke
u certainly must not have read the comics either
@roberto carvajal  ok. still  no.
@subject117m  fair
u must not have read the comics
@renato reyes  it still doesn t mean it works and when it s been used in so many superhero shows   movies much to the tiredness of audiences  it ll only make the movie look even more generic. team flash  team arrow  team shazam  team spiderman and now team blue beetle.
@jo nightwing  it doesn t work cuz in those movies their families didn t know about their powers til much later on in the comics where as with blue beetle specifically jaime s version he goes straight into telling his family especially shazam already the first movie and they immediately became the shazam kids which was way too early but i get wym jst hate how they ruined the chances of blue beetle actually being a movie that s accurate to its comic
woke.
batman is a fascist is from frank miller era dc
no bluebeatle looks like garbage
im a fascist and no batman isnt a fascist
meh.
this is the crappiest japanese spider-man i ve ever seen.
i want them to elaborate on how batman is a  fascist.  how do these random ass people know batman as a person. even if they said bruce wayne was it doesn t make sense. i d imagine the people of the dceu know a little less than we do of this version of batman and we already know very little besides the fact that he doesn t like aliens and loves team work........because team work is totally what batman is all about.......idk hiw they thought it was a good idea for him to be the one who unites the team. he doesn t become a team player till way into his years as a league member.
... and i m officially not going to watch blue beetle.
looks pretty boring.
oh look another movie to skip!
the trailer is not awesome tbh. also waiting to the end of the trailer to call batman a fascist is just unfortunate and unforgiving to me.
what the hell is wrong with the movie industry  it s just a sad joke now. i m glad i will have yard work  gardening  and house repairs to keep my mind off of this nonsense.
i was on board with this movie for everything except the batman is a fascist line. like they needed this line in the last part of the trailer. its like why  why are you disrespecting batman for
imho...looks like trash to me.
batman is a fascist  in the same movie where they made a latin boy a pool cleaner. progressive always have double standards.
looks boring
the bot upvotes on that trailer are insane. it looks even more mid than shazam. flop inc.
batman is a fascist
this looks like a cheap-ass made for tv cw show  only worse. goofier. shame on you dc. although i doubt he was involved with blue beetle  this is most likely what james gunn s dcu will look like. a bad marvel with joke after joke  wokeness. bats is a fascist  nah. hard pass.
i don t like the line but the people who don t like batman use that line in casual conversation against him back in 80s 90s when that came out.. when carrie kelly is bored in her room looking out of the window  her pot smoking roomates say this line. later  dr. bartholomew says this line later when talking on the news about how batman is the enemy and we need to care for the mutant gang
i appreciate this movie s nod to the older better era of batman with this line if they were using it as a throwback or easter egg for fans. if they weren t  then boo on them
i refuse to watch because of those propaganda comments. it looked okay until that. very lets copy iron man.
call me petty  but my love for batman makes me not want to support this movie just for that line.
@roberto carvajal  look most people don t know that. i mean i love dc but blue beetle is not some character that i find interesting.  this movie may change that who knows. but i mean as a trailer goes this one is not good. also you know the whole  normal  thing with the surrounding characters is not a problem for me but when you change flash in spiderman from a beefy guy to a m knight shyamalan looking dude with no muscles it s kinda lame. also this movie could be really good. i m not gonna judge a movie by its trailer.
@b n  that s fine. all i m saying is it wouldn t be fair to focus on one joke. everything else is your opinion and none of my business
@roberto carvajal  it s okay man we all are fans. it s all good and nice to meet you  i learned something
@b n  likewise. i do hope the movie is good and you too become a fan. been wanting for this for a long time. fingers crossed
@roberto carvajal  yes!!!if we like it then that s amazing!!! dc needs a good movie too you know.
because they want people talking about it. that s marketing
talia al ghul defending her baby daddy
blue beetle was created before iron man
this version of blue beetle if i m not mistaken is the 3rd and final version of blue beetle and it still came out i d like to say around 2 years before iron man
reaction videos are cringe
yeah the facist comment did it for me too.
nah   after that batman quote   i m turned off . tell it s gonna be another liberal mindset dumpster fire .
really sorry  but i don t understand why you even record any of the video if it s that bad. just watch it and give feedback without putting your upload at risk of tardation.
batman is literally the greatest hero in the world! this movie it s another woke b llshit and flop from dc  nothing new...
this movie is going to flop so hard  it will make shazam 2 look like avatar
truly the wb movie of all time boycottwb
what is for you though  you are so negative about everything. it is really annoying.
you insult batman i lose intereste
mid  that s giving it way too much credit. looks like sh t tier to me.
big maga vibes with this channel  ew
it looked good until the  batman is a fascist  comment. i m so tired of that crap.
it looks terrible and that batman line  . yeah i will be skipping this.
it looks bad
it looks like absolute and utter crap.
ehhh  another dc movie. another flop
i ll give you a thumbs up and leave. i really don t care about marvel  dc  or star wars. i never was a fan. i don t like super heroes movies or games.
looks like another cliche  glossy marvelized flick. pass. also that  batman s a fascist  line is cringe as hell. sigh...
@roberto carvajal  the batman line was just the clincher  the whole movie looks like a cw show.
@fortheemperor  i mean  you re not wrong. it was mean for hbo max but was moved to theaters so that s to be expected... it obviously didn t have a big budget during filming.you seem like those who need a hot girl in a movie to be entertained. car go boom  boom! people are so simple  but oh welleither way you re talking about it. playing into the marketing team s hand so they did their job
