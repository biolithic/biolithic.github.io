karen doesn t need to apologize. the art and marketing department needs too.
karen gillan sounds super cool and i love her sense of humor but no matter what she says  disney did her wrong.
it adds up when you realize that disney is making karen gillian do damage control for them
gillan knows exactly what the agenda is with the poster and has agreed for money  personal politics or both
so this is just karen being a good company man.actors don t just do whatever they want for a photo shoot  they are directed.and there were many photographs taken.and this was the one that was selected.and it does appear that there s some photoshop that erased her natural curves.honestly  while karen is being a good sport about it all  she didn t even address the main issue people have taken up with this poster.that she has a man s body.just because she stood like that  it suddenly wouldn t give off the illusion that her body was that of a man s.it appears photoshop was used to defeminize karen s natural curves.this tik took of hers seems more like she was instructed to put it out to run cover for the company.that s what i m getting out of this.
i think you re 100  right  mel. at this point i m convinced they re gonna do some nod to trans people and have her in an accident or something that will leave her as just a head. to keep her mobile  her head will end up on a man s robot body. when they find a female robot body  she ll say she s more comfortable on a man s. you didn t actually expect them to leave guardians of the galaxy untainted by the woke mob did you
great job melonie  i love karen s self awareness but she doesn t need to apologize  the art department and photographers should be the ones apologizing to her
i think it s funny that disney thinks we re all morons and can t tell the difference between the body types of men and women.
that s one of those cases where you can cleary see that karen agrees with the criticism but disney made she defend them
karen tried. which is more than most  karens  have done in recent years. seriously  the fact that most people are just impressed she didn t shame fans for misogyny or something  says where we are now.
karen gillan would make a fantastic politician  how she danced around this issue without addressing the issue was top class. its her face but its definitely not her body attached to it
i m just glad karen didn t get all defensive and  how dare you  and  if you don t like it  don t go see it.  we don t need you  about it like some other actors have done in similar situations.  she was just her normal  lovably awkward self.
she s a super cool person  one of my favorite actresses. this wasn t her  this was 100  disney being shady.
blaire white project episode 1 had buck angel  the og transgender man that was the test bed for many of the therapies used today to transition  and they discussed the evilness of the trans fad amongst today s young. also  tim pool just started an interview show and his first guest was that oli guy that tried to surgically transition first to korean then to female  and is now becoming an anti transition advocate.
i always forget that shes actually one of the hottest women on the planet.how the hell do you hire this nuke of a woman and cast her as the most unattractive character ever i know its not all about looks but  you know  its clear her looks are her most powerful trait  why would you not use that to your advantage  its like wasting her potential. but the fact that she can act nebula so well and make me completely forget that shes actually wicked sexy  is a testament to her acting skills. and to the makeup department too.just overall an incredible thing.
i appreciate that she at least acknowledges how weird it is. as drunk 3po said though  i have a hard time imagining they just let her pose however she wanted and didn t bother to give her any direction whatsoever. the fact that they have karen doing the spin doctoring here suggests to me  however  that it really is just a bad pose marketing decision rather than a plot point. if it were a plot point hiding in plain sight  i feel like they d just ignore it.
i like how karen gillan tried to make that pose seem awkward in her response video and just made it look great. she was like  see how awkward this pose is !  and i was like  no it s not! lol  you look fantastic! it was an obvious bad but intentional photoshop job  because.. progressiveness or something..
no one had an issue with karen s pose. it was the photoshop that people had a problem with
karen gillan is incredibly attractive and feminine. i think somebody in the marketing art direction team probably thought she looked too  hot  and attempted to tone her looks down. for some reason they seem to think that being an attractive woman is a bad thing.
karen has been one of my favorite actors since i first saw her in doctor who . she s a fantastic actor
this. she simply posed in nova s costume design. disney s vfx people mutilated the photo in post.
maybe she s getting pressured
no  she s in on it to and probably said absolutely nothing about because she s a hollywokie to
eh  shes part of it too id bet
all karen s  should apologize
i ve got a crazy theory that poster was very heavily manipulated by photo shop  just not only that  look at chris pratt  he looks very skinny   almost malnourished. chris in real life is way bigger than that!i believe like this the whole j.k rowling controversy with hogwarts legacy was artificially created to sell more copies of the game.
@garrus vakarian  neat how people on the internet just talk out their a   like this.
she s falling on the sword for something someone else concocted.  bring back dem curve ladies.make. curves. great. again.
@jay vega  we can t make them great  they just are
@jay vega  strangely... wasp s suit was way more feminine then her 1st one in the 2nd ant man... but then you get a poster like this... i have no clue whats up with that!
they padded her up or cgi her body. she explained nothing with her posing answer. very bizarre. karen is so slim and gemini in reality.
the trans idea i think  they basically took the female head and put it on a male body for whatever crazy reasons in the movie but she s probably going to represent a trans character. welcome to modern day american entertainment.
she was in doctor who for two seasons  and has a horror film called oculus.
@douglas briel  oculus is a nice little horror. the party is just beginning is another good film she stars in as the main lead
@paul woodford  sweet. i didn t know about that one. thanks.
sorta looks like they took the body off guy in the middle
@ace max  the trans what  wtf are you even talking about  they changed her because trans  you are do smart max
this is exactly what i thought when i heard her address this.
this is exactly what happened. they ve been doing that a lot ngl
it s pretty infuriating because karen is seemingly an absolute sweetheart and people will just accept the excuse because of that.
@h4rdi7g  that s a good point i agree
absolutely an acute observation
yup like when they made ewan mcgregor shame all the ray sists for complaining about whatever her name was in the obi wan show
making her  she is not a child. they re paying her  there s a difference. she could say no  she could ve said no when the shot was taken  she could ve said no when the contract was signed. she s as in on it as they are and it s obvious to see.
@gavin wilson  if she wants to keep her job with disney then she has no choice
@brian aguilar  exactly  if she wants  hence choice. actors refuse to do stuff all the time. these aren t frightened little children  they re savvy  veteran multi-millionaire  hollywood business people by this point. you re trying to tell me they would recast nebula because she didn t want to pose a certain way in a promo shoot  in this day and age  get real.
@jesse  neat how people on the internet just simp like this
facts
very good point
how did you get  to  right only the first time
did you ever hear about her role in jumanji  you don t have to wonder if you listen to her excuses.
she is doing what gina carano had to do to keep her job  go along with the denigration of her character and herself as an actress. gina refused to give up her integrity while karen doesn t seem to have any.
i don t know the person in order to make an absolutist statement like this  remember only the sith deal in absolutes  seems there is some corruption in your heart as well mark script
nda and all that
@ phonepunk   and now makes enough she can t even pay for the food catering in a movie
probably the contract that she signed long beofre the poster ever existed.
i don t know her positions on stuff  but yeah probably more on the side of just doing what the woke corpos want. there are more sane people than we realize.
@wind of change  not a good excuse  nobody forces you to sign one
absolutely. it s obvious they photoshopped that to make her body look like a man s. there is no way in hell it would appear that way just from the pose.
@grasslander  but.... why make beauty......  unbeautiful
are you just copy pasting this comment on every video on this topic
there s a possibility that it is  in fact  part of the story  and that this is why all the characters look odd in that poster. pratt looks skinny and batista looks short.i m thinking the villain of the new movie does something to then to cause their bodies to change and they have to find some way to change back. this would explain why gillan is addressing it while evading the real issue. the entire thing might be one big marketing troll and  if it is  then it s genius.then again  it could just be trans agenda like mac said.
@burntwood76  because women are taught to be ugly to avoid men
i m kinda disappointed she even did this  i think they re gaslighting and something happens to them during the movie and afternoon it releases and they re gonna be like look what ist and phobes you are
@jade runner 2049  well if it is part of the story as melonie said and that s what her body looks like in the movie  that would make it far worse.and it would still be very much part of that t agenda
@jade runner 2049  so it s a plot point that they swapped heads with the cast of  the big bang theory   that s a longer stretch than mr fantastic s dong.
yeeeep  no pose changes the natural female shape  they hate natural feminine beauty so much.
@burntwood76  be they hate existence.
@burntwood76  beauty is sexist and for   the male gaze  apparently.
she probably had approval over the photograph. in other words  they probably sent her a handful of shots to choose from. but the studio is ultimately responsible for the photo.
@chicken little syndrome  you re very naive. actors have zero say when it comes to the marketing of a movie.do you really believe disney lets its actors tell them how to market their 200 million dollar movies do you think any movie studio in the history of hollywood has ever let an actor decide which image should be used for the official movie poster.
i said that in another video comments area. she didn t do that video herself but was told to put out one to get people calm down or for marketing  like mm said.
@burntwood76  don t say  ugly and weird   do say  they them
@jade runner 2049  batista is sitting down  and pratt might have just actually lost a couple pounds bro  nothing close to what is goin on with karen here
something that this corner of the internet seems to be overlooking is that nebula is an android  and this could actually be a plot point that karen is not actually allowed to talk about for spoiler reasons. she could very well have a male s body for a chunk of the movie due to her main body being destroyed  or needing to infiltrate somewhere  or whatever reason.
@michael fox  that s still a choice being made by the filmmakers for to give a woman who has a naturally beautiful feminine body with curves a man s body instead.if that is the case  then that would be far worse than if it s just the poster.it s still the uglification of that which is naturally beautiful.just because it s something that may happen in the story  doesn t change that it s a conscious and deliberate choice to do so  on the part of the producers and the studio.and that doesn t change that the actress is still being instructed to run cover for the studio.
this sound so much like something they would do. i think you re gonna be right
@t m  sounds kind of like they re turning her into a ripoff of sechs from battle angel alita last order...
@t m  except that is never hinted at in anyway whatsoever anywhere else in marvel media. you re just preemptively getting mad at something that doesn t even exist. that s loser mentality.
@t m  nope  you and op are just cynical
man   woman look different  it s not rocket science.
can t say that anymore as its taught that there is no such thing as biological gender anymore
@uhdgamers 2015  what planet am i living on facts   knowledge and common sense is slowly becoming rare.i want to live on another earth like planet and start over.
@uhdgamers 2015  that s sad.
@sackboy biggest fan  curses  common sense is no longer common.it should be rare common sense.
@toy car   sushi writer  i d rather just not live on any earth at all. just send me to an alien planet where they acknowledge reality and science
@demiurge13  take me with you when you do.don t leave me here.
@demiurge13  i want to to do that too  very logical.
nonbinary is the disney way
marvel studios are making these movies not disney just because they own marvel doesn t mean they control everything marvel is still it s own thing!
money talks and i don t blame her at all however the issue still is awful and weird
its probably a contractual obligation at this point lol
@omar  she s under contract  it s not unlawful
made her  she is not a child
i know disney owns marvel but the marvel studios are making these movies not disney!
@amador cortinas  disney tells marvel what to do..they are the parent company
@jsbphotorebel  they are different studios just like disney has different studios the walt disney studios don t control what walt disney pictures and the same goes for lucas film it s still lucas film even though it s owned by disney  people just want disney to be evil so they can attack them but it didn t work in the past and it s not going to work now!
@jsbphotorebel  the only disney movie that even remotely had this agenda was the newest one a strange world!no pixar film has this agenda!
i would think she wouldn t be offended because her actual female body shape actually looks better than the weird pictures
@dantastic mania  lawsuits are already beginning and detransition sites and groups are exploding in membership. i heard the one on reddit is getting massive  but social media is preventing detransition content from having any reach.
thats an extreme case for sure. antitransition sounds like the gay transition therapy to me. seems it s people without enough knowledge or experience trying to make a change.
not gonna lie i always thought nebula was hot and when i found out how she really looked i was so surprised!
if i remember correctly she specifically took the role because it would force her to act and not just be scenery.
she is a terrific actress
a lotta people seem to have been aroused by her playing a curvy blue alien cyborg  i think they utilized her looks just the right amount
so you re gonna say that while simping this tarred and feathered youtube weather girl with her cut marks all covered in pb spillage... or what
yoo haha james gunn is a pos for doin that  make nebula semi attractive!! she is in the comics. ur right too karen gillan is extremely hot  10 10
such a shame to take a woman with such an amazing head of perfect red hair and make her.....bald
@sboink the leg day  what is pb spillage
all women all attractive  don t you know  the real problem is the male gaze!that s sarcasm btw
hey  melonie  just wanted to take a minute to thank you for all the hard work you do across your channels i try my best to keep up with things that are happening  but you manage to cover news and stories that i can miss. but what s more  you do it in a way where i don t have to worry about your content being vulgar. it s incredibly refreshing to be able to watch listen to videos and look at thumbnails that don t prominently feature the word f    all the time.but best of all  you consistently find ways to weave god into what you re talking about it  and you do it in a way that stays true to scripture. you don t allegorize or put a progressive spin on it. you give the gospel truth  and i love hearing it.praying that god continues to bless you and your platforms  and that he continues to mold you into who he wants you to be. thank you again for all your hard work and effort. i hope you have a fantastic tuesday
i think that disney told karen gillan to make the video as damage control.i don t think that this is just a case of bad photoshop on a poster. i think that the body-swap will be happening in the movie itself. i d recommend finding the superbowl trailer for  guardians of the galaxy volume 3   then going to 0 50 and watching the waist-down shot of nebula walking. in that shot  she s wearing the same outfit as on the poster. something looks very off about her  including the way that she s walking. if you go to the first few frames of the shot and pause  you will see what looks like a beer belly. then go to 1 49 in the same trailer  where she is again wearing the outfit from the poster. her chest and stomach areas are conveniently hidden  as she s carrying star-lord   her hips look narrow  and her legs look thick  karen gillan has long  slender legs - she has even joked in the past that she looks like a  ginger giraffe  . it doesn t look like karen gillan s body to me.if you go to to 1 27 in the first trailer  not the superbowl one   there are two brief shots of adam warlock brutally beating nebula. it s possible that he shatters her body so badly that she has to get it replaced with spare parts that rocket has lying around  rocket has a penchant for collecting such things   resulting in the different  manlier-looking body as seen on the poster. or maybe the high evolutionary does something to her. either way  i suspect that what we see on the poster will be happening in the movie.
tell me i m wrong  but i think that the actor owns the character once casted  not just the studio. maybe the studio has a desired character  but once they hand it off to an actor actress  the person playing the character actually creates it  the character is the actor.
her body probably gets destroyed in a battle and that s the image they went with as far as the movie goes. she s probably not allowed to really talk about it because it would give away spoilers. there s already a couple of characters that die in the film anyway because dave bautista s already said that he s not gonna reprise his role ever.
lol you got a good laugh out of me when you did the pose
also took me a while to realize gamora was even on the poster  they really do seem to be hiding any gender traits  even drax is sitting there in baggy clothes so you can t see his physique and quill looks skinnier than chris pratt really is
here s what i think will happen. a point in the story is going to be the trauma of thanos replacing basically every part of her body. so they re going to go through a thing of having her choose the body that she wants to have  and she picks a male body.
melonie  your thumbnail of this video tells the tale perfectly. yes  karen talked about her pose only  not the fact that her body was erased  maybe they used chris pratt s body  . ..  !  and replaced with who knows whom  the poster artist know . as the article later implies  if you look at all the female characters  none of the other two look particularly feminine either  in pose or posture .
she is so incredibly good looking  disney can t let that stand.
i think what happened  is that karen did take the picture as she said  but then marvel had it edited to look less feminine  which makes sense considering black widow did this too.
these group photos are composited from individual photoshoots  in case people didn t already know   but that also means several poses and photos are taken. so  even if that is her body  the poster artist went with the frumpiest looking photo from her promo shoot. her body shape looks more like the man on the far left  but every woman on that poster aside from gamora  looks less  curvy . starlord is looking less muscular as well  i sense shenanigans.
unfortunately there s no way she was behind this weird choice. she s just an actor playing a character. i really do hope no one s harassed her over this.
you re right. they didn t even have the respect of making her a chiseled gigachad.
not a great explanation by gillan  but at least she tried  lol. completely ignores the main issue people had  the dad bod. hope you re having a great day  melonie. love your hair like this
it s great to finally see my body type represented in a film! it s just a shame it s on an actress i really fancy!
another great video  melonie. watching these always brightens my day      definitely got a laugh out of you doing the pose too.
i would 100  accept if the movie poster appearance was a teaser to a plot element  but no one involved in the movie has even hinted towards that.
i don t know why  but it gives me the strong impression that the higher commands at disney made karen give this  apology   and also to take full responsibility for it. they possibly made her to play it in a  funny  way  and exclusively focusing on the pose itself and not on the main issue here.these same higher commands obviously ordered the poster to be tampered with. they removed the breasts and hips of all female characters  they thinned up chris pratt  to somewhat make him look like a beta   and deliberately gave nebula a male body  and a bit overweight for that matter .
karen gillan has a great sense of humour. i think she is taking the piss out of disney as much as she can without breaching the rules of her contract. it obviously isn t her in the photo  the image has been heavily manipulated. i doubt they even had her pose at all  just used a stock image as the base.
shame on disney! karen has always seemed like a fun likeable actress every since her amy pond days.  i can only imagine the horror she felt seeing this and the backlash.  plus  she is beautiful! why cover that unless you did it with a purpose
love this. she s so polite about calling things out and the haters are as vulgar and trashy as it gets in response. it s sad but their own fault.
what.....how does the high evolutionary fit into this event  i have some mcu questions and please help!  i ve missed alot of the print to video marvel history  the transition of abouta decade of character interaction.
@the unknown gamer  in the movie  the high evolutionary is the one who experimented on rocket and gave him intelligence. he is a mad scientist type who does all sorts of experiments on people and animals in order to try to evolve them in various ways.
@hardwicke benthow  the inhumans and the guardians of the galaxy  are not mixing well  except as sharedconcepts  while the origin of the high evolutionary is disconnected to me  in retelling ofthe marvel stuff as a new bunch of stories ....i m still lost.the mcu never had a warlock from counter earth...or beast man  dr. doom  brute... what happened to the eternals eggs or bucky i blame bad translations of the info to my head if  this quest for knowing something iswrong....so  the guardians of the galaxy never met marvel boy or based their team withanything to do with capt. america how about i quit reading old print comics and soak up the joy marvel provides for us.....
@the unknown gamer  i m not sure what you mean. if you re referencing the comics  it seems that this movie won t be very closely connected to the events of them.
@hardwicke benthow  i may have this figured out.marvel is decades old and i need to accept that.  wanting and waiting for stories are different topics.i enjoy what i have experienced  and appreciate thehelp in  transitioning  to the new marvel history.
no...actors dont own the ip
bautista is super duper woke so do not trust anything he says
she doesn t owe anyone an explanation
that was a possibility i was holding out for.i think the alternate universe   alternative team trope is way overdone.but it would make a good explanation.and why would anyone build a cyborg body  that is that undesirable
i think it s just a lame poster.
i actually watched her explanation the exact minute it dropped. i love her but uh yeahhhh i honestly don t know what to say
4 24 nailed it!
dammit melonie  you can t go and do that pose and then shop a dad bod on top! that shit legit made me almost spit out my drink lol
let s just see if i turn into a dude   best line so far. at leat she took it on the chin honestly  she could have gone nuclear victim.
a director approved the pose  a photographer took the shot  an artist had to touch up that photo and place it in the scene and a product manager would have approved the poster before sending it to a marketing department.... i don t think it s as whimsical as she says.   oh  i just posed and it looked bad after we took the photo.  like it was a selfie at a dinner party with friends.  oops!  if this is true  disney is incompetent.
it s not just her. look at starlord s physique in the poster. he looks nothing like in the previous movies.
on the topic of gender dysphoria and tbh ptsd-related sexualities  i feel like some amazing con was pulled off. people who choose or feel compelled to like or change whatever is one thing  but i always wondered if the people who were victims of sexual assault and subsequently became homosexual or another sexuality did it out of choice or trauma. same with gender dysphoria. the first people i heard describe their issues with it  i had trouble wrapping my head around it but it seemed like a deep rooted mental issue with body image. something that possibly should have been healed rather than accepted and incorporated into their daily life.i sincerely hope everyone in these communities are truly living their happiest lives because atp my greatest fear is we re normalizing and making things easier for predators by forcing everyone to think like the victims. live and love how you want and respectfully
04 11  that s not her body   i love the little inflection you gave it there to really emphasize it too lol
finally i feel my self and my dad bod represented on a movie  poster!
it s not just the aesthetics that the left have perverted. it s difficult to remain interested in marvel superhero movies  if none of the superheroes ever face dangers that viewers can relate to. everything is  safe  and non threatening. i really couldn t get invested in the avengers movies  no matter how many cgi enemies they destroyed.
i once looked like that or worse. i wouldn t want to push that  myself  on anyone  or push that past as an ideal or something to aspire to.  i just needed to heal myself and a push in the right direction
they just need you to see it once. mission acomplished!
karen sounds like she s a good time to be around.
karen s face  so many laughs with so little
the pose explanation wasn t adequate but  the background music to the explanation video was totally appropriate. it s like you said melonie   we should just be laughing at this because that s all there is left to do.
the side by side photos showed without a doubt it ain t the same person. look at the gap between the head and the elbow. in her photo there is almost no gap because the shoulders are narrow. the poster the same gap is huge  you could throw the raccoon thru it. great catch lady mel
it d be funny if the plot of the movie would be nebula lost her old body and they had to put her on a different body to save her and now she has to live with it  but if not i don t get it either
this body distortion was also done in the marvel comics themselves. artists drew female characters with flat chests  narrow hips  and masculine musculature.
she s either being used as a week cover up  or is knowingly doing this. and  less than stellar  that s putting it nicely. she s just talking about the pose not the fact that her head is on a man s body.
this is nothing more than a carefully crafted pr excuse. it s actually pretty sly  and somewhat competent. remember i said  somewhat .first  she takes responsibility for the decision  and they don t deny that it s not the best design. they don t blame the fans  call us names  or even try to convince everyone that it s actually a good pose. this is clever. doing any of the above would put the fandom on the defensive and cause a war. instead  they are deflating the entire argument..secondly  by putting the fault on her pose choice  she s drawing attention away from the poor design choice  and obvious effort to photoshop out her femininity to appease the alphabet mafia. so instead  we argue about how the pose is what has caused all her curves to disappear and turn into a man. instead of why some marketing woke weirdo decided it was better to change her body.
idk if this is a case of karen just trying to be a good employee... or if she s been actually convinced that that terribly photoshopped dude s bod with her head practically floating off it  it s like a child photoshopped this  my god. nightmare fuel  is somehow really her body. because that is absolutely a man s body.not  oh  wow you look manly in this picture for some reason. no- it s literally an actual man s torso digitally attached to her head. some might think the possibility she s actually thinking that s her body is ridiculous  but being a woman who is built like her  but also who has had very low self esteem throughout my life  and who values humility to a fault  i could imagine being in her position and being totally sure that was my body. my  ugly  ugly  body that s  my fault. omg why did i pose like that   manager   well  they did direct you to do so. you re an actor. you rarely make these decisions. also  it s irrelevant because that body isn t even your body. the pose isn t the problem. like  at all. so...  ugh i m such an idiot! an ugly idiot! why did i f up so bad  i ruin everything. manager   girl- no. aren t you listening ! it s not you. like  it s literally not you. actually  i m pretty sure that s steve the lot security guard. it s a man  baby. i feel for her. i really  really hope this is just her taking one for the team because she s trying to be a classy professional  and not her lacking the awareness that she is beautiful. she s absolutely gorgeous and should know there s no way in hell her body would ever look like that. like all women  even if she gained weight  and had the worst posture of all time  she d still have the same curves. i hope she knows
at first  i thought the shirt was just baggy and her actual body was hidden under it  but nope. they legit just gave her a full on beer belly dad-bod. it s genuinely weird when you think about it
karen gillan  you don t need to apologize. we understand what they are trying to do...
the pressure for an mcu movie to not be shit and perform well is so big now  due to their own hubris and missteps  - like with john cena s f f china apology to not let the work and follow-on income of so many people get impacted negatively by similar missteps  karen seems to be taking one for the team  unfairly  because they are indeed intending to push a transition arc on nebula and can see the pushback on the horizon after the ill-judged poster
she s playing damage control for the jerk that photoshopped her.
shes covering up for the plot point in the movie when nebula gets her head put on a male body cuz shes a cyborg. gotta push the message
every time i see the poster all i think is the line from spaceballs.   you idiots! these are not them! you ve captured their stunt doubles!
still got to love her accent
on top of karen s figure change  they appear to also have changed chris pratt s body too. it appears they made him less bulky.
smelonie smac on point as always!!!  keep up the good fight
i swear we live in an alternate timeline of some other timeline cause this be gettin nutty all up on the beat
karen gillan was great as  amy pond  in doctor who.
i think it s great. seeing that poster saved me 20 bucks  d
this is what i m afraid james gunn is bringing into the dcu
my take on it  could of easily been explain by using the multiverse or that during the thanos fight they couldn t fully rebuild her
girl  you just rock!
i have a question  is this happening all over the world or is this just in america
agreed this will relate to something in the movie she can t discuss for plot reasons. i m not a marvel expert  but i think nebula s body is pretty much mechanical  so if they write up some kinda problem with that  then like c3po s head winding up on an attack droid s body  we could see nebula s head being transplanted somehow. which if it wasn t for the current agenda madness  could actually be pretty funny...and we know gunn likes to inject a lot of wacky humor  often about body parts  eg. rocket always wanting some guy s eye  or arm or whatever . soooo....if it s played strictly for laughs  then fine  no problem. have to wait for the movie and see.
karen either hasn t seen the doctored image on the poster or she is not allowed to say anything about it at this time.
i saw a video recently a lot of movie posters are just done subpar compared to the past. it s never fun when they take my crush from the only seasons of new dr who i watched  with matt smith  and mess with her
i don t get what the joke is about rocket wanting prosthetic body parts is though
@brian aguilar  it s not really supposed to be a  joke ...more a running gag that s funny cos it s a bit weird and wacky. very james gunn tbh.
@dewulfe99  but gags are jokes
whatever dude  if you don t get it  you don t get it
they are trolling us and we took the bait hook  line  and sinker. also  have you noticed how starlord lost all his musculature  either there are some reality bending shenanigans going on in the story or the marketing team thought they would have fun with their critics.
karen doing the pose on video and she actually looks like a female with curves  even without being in top shape for the film   a professional photographer   studio lighting and photoshop that goes in to a poster to make actors look good.
if you look closely at the trailer you can see karen really had a dad bod  so that is her in the poster. unfortunately  unless they cgi d her face into a dude s body in the movie too  our girl really let herself go.
i did that pose and i looked like karen gillan so i guess it works in reverse too.
karen drew attention to the poster yet didn t at all mention the elephant in the room - there will be an explanation for this in due course but they are up to something
love what you said about not glorifying the problem
i bet the next guardians film is as good as this poster.
this was a poor explanation by her. but i still think it s a dudes body not her. love the reel you made earlier melonie
body replacement. i ve been in retouching for 20 years. pretty common with fashion. shoulders are counter-posed to the hips as well. head and shoulders are facing left  hips and legs are facing right.
loved it when you tried that pose!
karen represents my bodytype in that poster but sadly i am not happy about that at all.
check the latest trailer for guardians 3. mantis  nebula  and gamora lose all body shape once in those comic accurate guardian costumes. it s super weird.
imagine karen as batgirl or batwoman.
karen is showing a sense of humor about the poster  but it makes me wonder what the tone of the mouse people was.
plot twist  they forgot to call her in for the shoot that day  so they got a random person to fill in and tried to fix it in post  with... varying degrees of success.then they later have to call her up and tell her to  cover for them ...
seriously  that looks like they just took chris pratt s body and stuck her head on it.
i ve seen the video of some random youtuber who edited the poster to make her  suit todays modern agendas   is hat he described his project as. it s not something that is from the actual promo for the movie.
damn i really was being optimistic and hoping something else was going on.
another thing my church leader has said is that in the last days the wicked will be more wicked but the righteous will also be more righteousand i m definitely seeing the righteous get more righteous to combat the wicked getting more wickedthank you and people like you for being brave and standing up for what s right
with how disney writes contracts i guarantee that karen will never address it publicly. even if she wanted to she wouldn t be allowed to.
exactly she didn t address the real issue she was deflecting.. i give her a little credit for what she said  but every sane person can see what is wrong with the poster..!!!
supposedly  gunn s son is the body on all the characters on the poster
i suspect someone in the art department is gonna have a lot to answer about this horrible nebula s appearance on this image.
i first saw the poster  i was all like   who tf is that   .
i still think it has something to do with the high evolutionary.   i do like the tag line   rise of the they thems  though.
even if nebula would get another body  it wouldn t make sense at all to put it in the posterps melonie  i love your brain
i still find it funny that people are actually saying that looks like karen. you can clearly see the difference.
if i had to guess  the art department used stand-ins for the poster and then either they accidentally forgot to fix this part of the poster in post  or they just got lazy and said fuck it  good enough.
this is what happens when special effects are used for evil.
heck ye  mantis is my favorite too!
imagine if they do a full on fliparoo  and say that thanos force transitioned him into  a her  and now she wants to go back to her original self  for which seh gets a new body xd
like finn getting shrunk or black panther wearing a mask we know what they are trying to do.
my guess is that they had some guy with one of those green man bodysuits dress up like everyone  do the poses  then digitally replaced his head with each actor s head.
they have photoshopped that poster soooooo badly. first  karen gillam is 100  photoshopped with the exception of her head for whatever sick reasons disney seem to think are legitamate. also  look at chris pratt also  that s something not many people have been talking about either. they literally photoshopped about 10-20 pounds of muscle off the guy! his chest and arms are so much skinnier than they ve ever been. not to mention they re covering up drax and mantis. i can t comment about gamora since you can even see her in the picture as it s cut off at the bottom. it s almost like disney is trying to make these people androgynous  removing whatever traces they can of masculine or feminine beauty  which is just yet another example that disney should never have been given the marvel license because they flat out don t understand or care what made comics so popular in the first place. disney is truly going full stream with the woke idealism to the point that this looks like they re bear-hugging the whole  non-binary  concept to death.
tin foil hat  there is a pink triangle hidden between her legs. they do odd stuff like that  also notice the pink seems to come from nowhere   is focused on her character. few coincidences  triangle  pink   it s right on the person in question. also possible  as so above so below  symbolism.
i was going to suggest you not replicate the pose at the risk of you morphing into a dude bod but too late love her! no question it s disney poorly sailing the ship  but she can t do much unless she s willing to jump overboard
i ve watched a number of movies over the past couple of years where they ve allowed the actresses to gain weight. the first one i noticed was rey in the last jedi. she was at least 15lbs heavier in that movie than the one that ended literally one day before the next one started. must be the force. then she lost it all again for rise of skywalker. we don t want to see ourselves in superheroes  we want to see people 100x better than us. we want to see  the ideal .
you can t hide her legs. she was in doctor who for two seasons.
as a commercial photographer of 20  years it looks like someone simply photoshoped her torso and hips to look more like that of homer simpson.   i do not even think they bothered to put her face on a mans body think they just went nuts with the liquefy tool.
everything well said mel.
my suspicion is they photoshopped her body because they wanted to make nebula look more gender ambiguous. it s a character who can literally switch out body parts  of course liberals are going to stick their grubby fingers in and try to make her a non-binary icon.but karen gillan is a national treasure. where so many others would make this a volatile issue  she diffused the whole thing had a laugh. made it a non-issue. very admirable!
this isn t even just not wanting above average breast sized characters or such  its just hating anything physically female as well as most female characters tend to be given overly masculine personalities even consider if they are some sort of female action character which is waaay to common the last while  and i don t even think its just trans agenda but certain other groups who hate femininity on females masculinity on males or more mature body features of both males and females
alright u already know i would show up lol
well  looks like disney is saving my wallet more cash this year. yes!
melonie mac   make marvel male again. some time later..melonie mac   that is karen s face on a dude s body! lol
mel  thanks for saying the truth about the community.  they need help  not glorification.
i mean  nebula looking a little more chunky lines up. she s riding with the guardians now and they were all ragging on quill for putting on weight when they found thor.clearly quill keeps too many snacks around the ship and nebula fell into bad habits!
that woman is so beautiful. her nebula character never needed to look like a bald cyber-rat.  see her original design in the comics . hope this movie fixes that issue but then again this is disney. they will just use her to shove something down the world s throat. again.
can t unsee melonie with a beer gut
looks like they took photos individually and paid a  5er for someone to make a poster
how does she manage to grow her hair two feet long so quickly when she gets her head shaved bald to play the character  is there some miracle-grow for hair
the trailer doesn t show any of this and it doesn t leave the impression of the stage 4 cancer starlord like love   thunder did. but this poster was a decision accepted by many high up people  to be released at all  and if they re willing to release content they know will negatively impact sales- there is a serious problem. doesn t make me like karen less  she is an awesome actress that keeps me laughing
i m not a trekkie but when you said amorphous blob the first thing i thought of was the borg.
i think they ll go all deadpool and have her a talking head for a while until she gets a new ma am body.
yeah it s not her body.  she s being nice and covering for her colleagues
brought the show-and-tell today i see. another comment for the algo and another video ftw melonie!
hi melonie i m glad too see you are doing better from beingsick.
to me it sounds like she is trying to hide the fact they will transition her in the move.  they worried that nobody will go see it if we know its a trap.
it s another case of the art and marketing department messing up and not swapping out the stand in poser for the actual person. we saw this a few years ago on the harry potter poster where ginny weasley was not even the actual actress.
i trust james.  for now.
it s just so uncomfortably weird. they could have said she wasn t available for the photo shoot and it would have been weird  but whatever. the fact that she claims that s actually her makes it even more bizarre! there is literally no reasonable excuse why they replaced her body with a mans  unless it is an agenda.
haha she s called it a dad bod..
the one karen i acutely like and care about wtfck
hands off karen gillan!
this means she watches these certain creators and youtube channels
nebula is super attractive. for some reason i never anticipated that.
maybe its part of the story.maybe she is very disliked by the production people or whoever makes the poster  art that would be a gnarly way to rip on somebody you work with
this is my new fave channel and probably the first and only one that ima smash that bell for. karen who the only thing i saw the whole video was like a bunch of stars and lil floating hearts around a creater and everything else around that face just faded into tunnel vision your fine a f melonie mgb
that dude belly edit good job keeping things informative and entertaining at the same time.
it s taskmaster all over again.
agree with you entirely melmac. that s not her body and i don t understand why she s trying to pretend that it is .
nobody has mentioned that they have  taken chris  who in the first two was turbo buff  and on the poster he looks like he wouldn t be out of place in that terrible big bang theory show.
it s gotta be on purpose and to be talked about. yeah she did the pose but they do edit the photos in post.
i have a dad bod ... in fact i have a double dad bod  it s real  and it s spectacular!!!
maybe she identifies as a dad now
haven t had chance to watch yet  because working. love the fact that melonie is reviewing her comments from the gym  though. go to the gym!!!!
disney  sexualization is wrong!thor love and thunder enters the chat
like  who in the target demo actually wants to see nebula looking like that  like  what s the goal
i disagree about it being part of the story. if there s an actual reason for it in the story and it s handled the right way ie not glorified but depicted as something horrible  then i m fine with it. there s a possibility that it is  in fact  part of the story  and that this is why all the characters look odd in that poster. pratt looks skinny and batista looks short.i m thinking the villain of the new movie does something to them to cause their bodies to change and they have to find some way to change back. this would explain why gillan is addressing it while evading the real issue. the entire thing might be one big marketing troll and  if it is  then it s genius.then again  it could just be trans agenda like mac said.
tis a shame  she s a gorgeous gal and killed it as nebula in guardians 1 2.also i had no idea she was irish until she started talking!
when these things happen i don t hold anything against the actors. it s their job. they have to do with what they are given  if a script or story sucks thats not their fault. i just get mad when they try to lecture me on politics or virtue signal. for a girl named karen  she sure sounds pretty cool. xd
i know roflmao
strait hip and no chestshe is a beautiful woman that someone was clearly envious of!
thank god  spring is coming! this is all getting way out of hand now!
i feel bad for karen. it seems like she wanted nothing to do with it. i don t blame her.
great melonie mac go boom karen gillian appearance
they just don t want to say they are going to make her bisexual. they don t want fans to not go to the movies and have guardians of the galaxy bomb at the movie theaters.
i m hoping it s just a joke in the movie that s being  kept secret. these movies are pretty humorous and goofy  and i m thinking that nebula s body is going to be   in the shop  for repairs and that body she has now is a loaner. like a crappy rental car
i loved her in jumani  with the rock.
5 bucks says the villain experiments on her and does change her! cause that s the whole deal with the character! he is a mad scientist who made rocket!
nebula is in the same situation c3po and one of the battle droids were.
i ve pretty much skipped most of the mcu movies sense no way home. this was the one that i was looking forward to seeing but not after that poster.
with all of this happening in the world today i just can t help but think about that scene in smallville in the very first episode at the cemetery with clark and lana where lana asked if clark is upset about a guy and clark nervously say s no and how that would be seen as homophobic and tom would be considered a biget i don t even know how to spell this stupid word it s fake like all of the random genders anyway and smallville would probably have been cancelled and none of these superhero movies would ever be a thing!
she s gotta boss. girl s gotta eat.
nowadays disney does this kind of crap to start internet  outrage  and get free press from channels like yourself. controversy clicks. i hate whoever first brought that up  but i have to admit it is brilliant and it works.
something is making me think that the poster is a reference to an old movie sitcom
just so you know  femen  is very common in japanese media whether it s video games or anime just so you know.
karen gillian is a very fit  toned  athletic and drop dead gorgeous woman  why isn t she being casted as laura croft
my face was smashed together with someone else s body years ago when my images were used in my company s advertising. i looked like a goblin. she is towing the company line  they knew what they were doing.
look at the shoulders on the poster  the shoulders on a man are 3 heads wide  but if you look at a feminine petite woman like melonie mac or karen gillan  they are only 2 heads shoulder to shoulder. in this poster we see karen gillan s head on a body that is 3 heads wide  shoulder to shoulder. this is impossible since karen gillan s body is very feminine and she has the natural female around 2 heads width from shoulder to shoulder
they must have looked at her stills from the jack black movie and decided they wanted the total opposite. disney singled her out 100 .
the pose isn t the issue it s the body. though guys usually do poses like this but usually with ther hand on the back of their neck.
well  i won t be going unless there s a huge change in things. and it doesn t look like it ll be happening anytime soon.
@edward bernard  it looks like they are going to make starlord and nebula start to fall in love. i bet she will tell him that she is not a she. i will also be sitting this one out. we both can hope for the bests but i think your right.
i m fairly sure it s karen s head on sean gunn s body. i just have no idea why they d do that.hopefully there s a good  non-trans  reason for it. like maybe karen was busy and couldn t take a photo so james just got his brother to do something and photoshop nebula s head in place... and it s not actually a real representation of the movie  just something that they found funny... it sounds like something the gunn s would do...but if it s in the movie then no matter what they actually intend  one way or another someone s gonna equate it to a trans metaphor...
....that cannot be her body  something is weird here  this has to be a plot point.
do you know how the whole deal about her coming up with the pose s a lie because gamorra s also doing that pose  almost exacly the same pose...
she s a modern day natural beautiful red haired woman  i know nebula is a half machine  half alien  but come on  it s almost like disney and marvel is trying to hide her natural beauty because she is white  the other women of color have to be the ones to shine their beauty  bulging muscles  scolding dirty looks and all.modern day marvel and disney just hate red haired white women  geekysparkles from clownfishtv did a whole rant video about it  hell  they even replaced ariel the little mermaid to their favorite color.people say anything about it their called racist  yet they are being racist against red haired white women and straight white men  and blackwash characters.
something my church leaders have said is  you should be attracted to a woman for her feminine features at the time i thought that was just addressing gay men but now it s become more than thati like that a church leader said thisit s like  oh so my natural desire to be attracted to a woman s body is a good thing just don t objectify them of courseand in the world today that is actively trying to erase women  it really is important for us men to let women know they are attractive as feminine womendon t let them get sucked into the lie that they have to look and act like a manmake them feel good about being a womanand that goes both wayswomen should show that to men tooanother quote i recently heard is  the best way to combat the destruction of the family is with the family so why shouldn t that apply here toothe best way to combat the destruction of masculinity and femininity is to embrace your masculinity as a man and embrace your femininity as a womanand as a man you let a woman know how much you love her femininity and as a woman you let a man know how much you love his masculinityi think that s a good rule of thumb in generalfor all the things the left are attackingthe best way to combat their attack is to appreciate the thing they attack even more
it s simple they probably farmed it out to some cheap photo studio who used interns and photoshopped the actors faces on it afterwards. she is lying her to protect the brand and going with the gaslighting because brand social media manager probably came up with this strategy. but that s definitely an out of shape dude in that photo. the amount of people buying her lie is as sad as her throwing herself under the bus for a company who obviously doesn t care about her character.
her trying to explain it away is ridiculous...they would have taken 100s of photos of her on the photos shoot and this is the one that the director would have chosen to put on the final poster. the actors probably didn t do photo shoots on the same day  and the final poster is designed  positions of characters arranged and changed to suit the layout and brief they were given. and i think part of the brief was to make them look like a bunch of dudes hanging out  which they do...not a single curvy person on the poster. sad times.
i m more voluptuous than  she  is. it s not an issue with the pose  as she claims  it s with having her face shopped onto keith s body.
on the plus side  i am now as hot as nebula.  didn t think that would ever happen.  karen gillian is a very attractive women and i m a middle age  dad bod  guy.
karen isn t the art-department.  if anyone should be offended  it should be her.  but she s got to work in hollywood so she s just going to make a joke of it and move on.
i respect her humor about it instead of being defensive like so many actors.
they completely forgot she is a warrior and a fighter  that body doesn t add up at all lmao.
it s so easy to skip marvel movies now  whereas it was first day showing must see features in the past. i ve skipped a bunch of the recent movies entirely. i ve been a hard-core marvel fan since the early 1970s. such a shame...
after watching her reaction i noticed she dodged the actual issue  nobody cares about the pose. it s the fact that nebula no longer looks feminine.
from that poster alone  my flop senses are tingling...
at this point it s just absolutely hilarious.  disney is just continuing full steam ahead like steamboat willie into the woke bs as their company crumbles around them. these people must truly be insane.  they keep moving forward expecting a different outcome.
she just try to save the day and takes responsibility instead of the real guilty people from disney.
someone at marvel thought to themselves if people liked  fat thor  they ll love fat nebula.  let s call that a comedy fail.
this whole  controversy  only began due to the use of heavily doctored images as  proof   or as people usually say  lying  and even her time in jumanji is modified a fair bit  as she has stated on the record due to similar controversy. and now she comes out  says she did the pose and it wasn t flattering  due to her being tall  what she is wearing  the pose  etc  and still you all gotta run with it even throwing in the  trans agenda  as part of it.this has become so boring and so predictable. i hoped this video would bring back my subscription. but you seem too far down the rabbit hole to realize you have become that which you hate.
i don t think this is karen s fault. if she doesn t do what disney says  she doesn t have a job. i don t think disney has any mercy
1 20 it s probably because she s contractually obligated to not spoil the fact that she s probably getting a new  mechanical  body swap because she s a  cybernetic  type of character and disney wants to use that for their advantage for messaging purposes to promote woman-to-male representation    so basically she s been asked to do  damage control 2.0  for her character by orders of marvel-disney  but that s just my predicted opinion..great video melonie!      with our combined strength we can end this destructive conflict and bring  back  order to the galaxy
don t look at me. i m going to see shazam 2.
is this meant to have all of them look older  or like.. retirement age   because quill looks skinny  like he s stopped working out.
that s not karen s body. that s a karen s body
she could have let it slide a little like thor did. people change shape  i don t remember anyone seriously saying thor was being made more womanly with his new pregnant looking belly.
maybe nebula is searching for zer identity  or transitioning to a non-binary robotic form. i mean  can you tell the sex of a cylon raider pilot without turning it over
yeah  the m-she-u know what they are doing  remember the whole she-man i mean she-hulk was on purpose too! they did it to upset the fandom  because they can do whatever they want  and the shareholders  don t care .until it affects their profits that is .
karen pretending the pose was her idea is a very pathetic lie  any expensive photoshoot especially for a big movie like this would have been planned down to the tiniest detail what there wearing where they stand how they pose would have been decided by the photographer and the team behind them.
i agree her body looks like a flat rectangle in the poster but karen gillian seems like a pretty decent person. i actually liked the way she responded  i was expecting her to give the standard hollywood response about how people are objectifying her and promoting unrealistic expectations for women s body standards  etc.  but instead she just had fun with a little light self deprecation humor and agreed that she looks dumb in the poster. she probably got paid a million dollars to be in the movie so i don t think it would be worth her time to care too much if they photoshopped her image on the poster to make her less curvy. she was lots of fun in the jumanji remakes as well  i think she has a good sense of humor and seems pretty cool.
yeah they don t choose poses. they re puppets for the photography guys in the studio. she didn t choose to stand like that.
amen. it s all about the inversion of god s design for humanity. if we are made in his image  twisting and corrupting it would be a sure-fire way for demonic forces to make a statement of their power.
disney did karen wrong. it s obvious she has natural curves and they shouldn t be erased. as a woman who has breasts and hips  i would find it jarring if someone edited those out when getting my photo taken. you can tell by the awkward pose they were trying to make her look as less feminine as possible.
so. this movie trailer pushes starlord x nebula  because heaven forbid gramora be an actual love interest   so... now the theory is they body swap nebula  why would this not surprise me after the thor l t trailer tried shipping starlordxthor.
neat vid   tbh nebula was pretty funn  and h ttt  big reason why i like guardians
just like taskmaster in black widow it was the stuntman in the costume and at one point on the bridge fight scene you see the private part bludge on the camera and i m like isn t she supposed to do be a female
i m sure you are correct  even more since the villain is the high evolutionary.her head will be transplanted into a male s dude  that s a given.even more  since he is the high evolutionary  it will be played as a sort of evolution.this is not innocent  the villains choice is not innocent.this will gotg  trans edition.
this is blasphemy. this is madness!!
karen gillan looking gorgeous   her new long hair is beautiful and she was a bit chubby in a recent interview but now she looks leaner. awesome.
that is the best example of hollywood s hypocrisy  a woman girl let that studios photoshop her body and make that she then took the responsibility like if we were idiots and didn t know she has nothing to do with what is shown in the poster  she accepts or not the role and once she signs the contract her image is not hers. it s same hypocrisy as balenciaga advertise  blaming the photographer .
rise of the they thems   coming to a theater near you 2025.
this is sparta
this kind of looks like aping mars attacks to me  only putting nebula s cyborg head on a bloke is a helluva lot lazier than putting it on a small dog.
here s what i think happened   they made up this poster where that s totally a dude s body with her head on it  because gender queer or whatever is so hot right now  barf ...then got all this pushback because obviously...so the studio made her come out and make this silly little video about it that doesn t even address the real issue people had but she s trying to be cute so we ll forget...essentially trying to step in front of the bullet for disney marvel...but it s not working because they think we re idiots and we re not.
i ve stopped giving disney my money for any reason. my fiancee wanted to see the new avatar and we did. she paid.
i almost miss my old career in my 20s when i attracted beautiful ladies like this host. being a christian who doesn t sell drugs is way more fulfilling  but i sometimes  miss the beautiful ladies as company.
nebula is started to look like  parks   rec  chris pratt
karen gillan is fine  no blame for her. i m more confused about what the art editors were trying to convey .
not making excuses for disney s poor choice of promotional material  but that could be just a poor camera angle  which is still inexcusable for something going on a poster . also  and hear me out  here   perhaps most  if not all  of those pose other pics were photo-shopped  hollywood  right  even the sexiest celebs can flash a bit of cellulite at times  so the digital nip tuck is practically universal.also  the clothing can make a big difference. alicia silverstone s batgirl costume made her look like she had a beer gut  imo  anyway   and those pants do something similar  by being low slung.
it aint the pose thats the problem. the studio has her running cover and now they will have to cg her real body back on to the character.
disney clearly thinks that since nebula is a cyborg she s nonbinary
they gave her a dad bod for whatever reason...
either nebula gets a body swap or dismarvel is intentionally androgynizing her women to please the wokies.
gotg is my favorite sub-franchise within marvel. i haven t paid for a marvel movie since losing iq points after i came out of love and thunder despite thor being my second favorite sub-franchise. not gonna go see this one either.
coming from the past  and i m very late.but!i d like to  predict  the head swap thing.not spoiler  it s flaps!
as a straight male  i have a natural radar for attractive females.  it pings like crazy when i see karen gillan in her natural human form  or mel in hers.  less so for old nebula  but it s still there.  seeing this new nebula...  no ping at all.  that s a man  baby.
say what you want but her deflection was kinda funny lol
there is also a scene in the trailer where nebula is walking and the camera pans down and it looks like they used a male actor because her body   walk was that of a man. and this wasn t a poster  it was in the actual trailer. i have zero intention of watching this movie  as it seems like james gunn wants to use this last gog movie to push his woke agenda. basically  it appears as if they are going to make nebula masculine   then have her  him    starlord have an affair  giving the impression of two males having an affair  in order to appease the woke mob. i m so sick of this insanity  especially when its done in such deceptive ways. its called  propaganda  folks.
i m kinda 50 50 on this one now. it is a terrible pose. her feet are pointing one way and her body   head is facing the other way so her body is twisted... there s also the terrible choice of loose fitting top making it look like she s got a beer belly going on... but it also looks like she has a pectoral muscle showing under her right arm rather than any sort of feminine shape   _   _    i can clearly see that... and i don t work in photography graphic design. either the photographer  costume designer and maybe image editor need to be fired or someone made a conscious decision to go with that  look  for a reason. it s definitely odd
but  but  melonie...they added cosmo to the line-up. that makes up for anything they do  right  right
just like in the second movie when drax said   i have sensitive nipples   we are going to get a scene where nebula says   my balls are sweaty .
she s lying. she knows damn well that they take about 1000 pictures and then edit. it s not like it s the only pose she made and they had to use it. they are also told how to pose. i would bet they also told her to release that cringe response.
come on folks. fat thor was a hit. disney wouldn t let that just die.
angles and lighting make all the difference. i would suggest spending more time in the real world  because it s rather disconcerting that you don t know what real humans look like.
karen is cool  pushing agendas to their downfall
i think the body swap is supposed to be a funny coverup for desaxualizing the character. i was never a guardians fan so i really don t have a dog in this fight.
looks like her head on sean gunn s body. he s in the movie so maybe there s something that happens in the movie that explains this.
nebulas appearance in the poster makes me nauseous and i m not even joking. i can only stand to look at it for about 1.5 seconds. and i m not even that shallow.
i think that s what woke sees the future for the human race. androgynous. that s what we ll all be like eventually.
chris pratt looks like an emaciated high school audio visual nerd in that poster.
if they re worried about making women feel self conscious by showing amazing figures of female actors  that s a stupid reason. if someone feels self conscious from looking at a good looking person that means that they have low self esteem. so instead of showing sexy women  they show ugly women in movies and other media to help justify the low self esteem that some women feel. it says  it is okay to not take care of myself and my health.
i think its just photoshop situation if you look at don  war machine  they use his same face in all the posters he s in
they likely put nebula s head on the only body available  and it s a dude s body! she is a cyborg  after all. this body is strong enough for a man  but made for a woman--this woman!
damn  i love you !
hey  i look like a dude  too!i m finally feeling represented!
yeah  the  pose  is not the issue!   or at most  it is only part of the issue the issue is  when fit  men s bodies are geometric shapes!   squares or triangles if you are really  in shape  whereas fit women s bodies are gentle waves   curves!good on gillian for trying to address it with lighthearted humor though.i remember years ago  when feminists were pointing to the expense of women s tops compared to men s shirts as  proof  of the so-called  pink tax .  and watching a video explaining how simple   blocky the fabric patterns shapes for men s shirts were  thus less expensive to make   compared to the more complex   varied designs and pieces that went into sewing a woman s top to make them fit  comfortable!   more work  more cost  more expensive
disney needs to apologize to her. like  right now. or pay her a lot of money.
it is 100  going to be about nebula becoming a  trans  person. shes going to get injured in a battle and quil and rocket are going to fix her with the only body they have and everyone is going to laugh when they reveal it and then except it.
if this is a plot point in the movie  that doesn t inspire confidence in the movie...james gunn s sense of humor continues to be really weird to me.
she still has the curves when she does it in the video.... but love her accent
even in the preview of the movie  she looks nothing like she did before. you can t take back a movie and redo what a mistake they have made. it is clear they intended to make her more manly in the movie as well. as i said  not watching this one and glad i have the first two movies. movies are clearly getting out of hand. i told my mom that in about 5 to 15 years we want have movie theatres because they are ruining original movies with remakes to fit in with todays society and not producing any thing worth watching. very few film makers are sticking to their own ideas and not what people are demanding they do. really sad.
all-in-al it s a bad poster. to call it a bad photoshop job is an understatement.
i agree  and look at everyone else. i think this poster is telling us this isn t the guardians we ve known. drax looks puffy and is wearing a shirt  he didn t wear shirts before because they hurt his nipples. groot looks horrible  peter is skinny  gamora is all chill and being silly - very much against her character arch. this whole poster is a troll.
i m betting it works with the story. body switcher gun or clone or something. now whether they use that as some sort of trans acceptance  i wouldn t be surprised.
ion kno what these part threes told people about what or how supplements make u act towards neighbors
this movie looks a lot like the square enix game  which is fantastic. i m kinda psyched tbh
her dad tried to make a fat thor android but he got a copyright strike so he had to swap her head in
nebula doesn t have her original natural body and if you wanted to make her stronger but didn t care about appearance how would you piece her together.i think it s  who cares  territory and i m not taking the bait.if they did that with gamora  i ll take the bait and reee about it.
her response didn t address what the actual issue was. it was clearly a side-step on her part  but i can understand her not wanting to get involved in gender politics.
they photoshopped michael rooker s body on her.  all i saw was merle dixon from the walking dead in that poster.
at the end of the day  it s more wokeism.  either an artist decided to portray her that way on the poster  or a writer wrote a storyline where her body gets changed into a man s body. it all comes from the same place  and it s stupid.
insane in the membrane!
well  what fun is making all your female characters just more like men when you have a character that you can just wholesale turn into one
isn t she supposed to be more machine then organic  why would she look human in any natural way  i think it adds to her tragic character even. on top of everything she doesn t even look female after being turned into a cyborg. that would be added identity crisis for anyone.
finn fem fel!   ... and mantis is really covered up  drax is wearing a jacket and much less muscle on the starlord.
if this isn t a prime example of hollywood trying to erase beautiful women and trying to end showing beautiful women as being feminine than i don t know what is. if i were her or someone who is close with her i would be very angry with this poster. it makes her out to be a slightly over weight middle aged dude. this seems to be another example of trying to erase women  in sports  entertainment  etc. . it s evil.
crazy stuff for sure.  i don t think i ll watch this movie  i checked out of the mcu after endgame  but i am curious as to how they re going to explain this nonsense!!!
karen gillan should have followed jack black s advise and do the cute anime face it be much better. but jokes aside they could have gotten her a better lazy geek look.
even if it s apart of the story  there is no way it s gonna go down well. either they re doing it for comedy  which they know will get the ire of the woke  or it s seriously trying to turn her trans.
or  and just hear me out here  karen s shirt in the poster doesn t wrap tightly around her body the same way her usual leather attire would. crazy idea  right fellas
i think the poster is story related or thematically related and played for laughs  but no one really found it funny.
karen . wasn t she amy from doctor who
the shirt is tight on her. you need to get your eyes checked if you can t tell that s an obvious man s body with her head on it lol
i ve hesitated to comment on this online because i admire karen gillan a lot  and she basically just got married  for god s sake... i don t think it s that obvious they re making nebula a transgender character in the movie  this only looks like marvel had someone erase her femininity on photoshop.wouldn t be much surprised if your theory is proven right in the end  however.
i dunno. given it s the guardians movie  this may just be a comedic in relation to the story in context. like as you said  something happens and she has to do a body swap and they make it comedic. it isn t necessarily  woke . this type of scene is and an old comedic juxtaposition.
it s not the m-she-u anymore. it s the m-they-u.
the only reason to do videos on marvel is to compare how upset we are at losing formerly quality entertainment and at the current ridiculous political force-feeding they dish out instead. there is no point is talking about how awesome marvel is anymore because is hasn t even been ok for years  let alone good.
that s karen gillian s face on danny mcbride s body. that s photoshop. somebody did that on purpose and she talked about her pose and completely glossed over the work somebody put in to deliberately look androgynous.
it s a play at making nebula a transgender character. i bet the stories arc changes dramatically as well.
basically  she joked about it like how todd howard joked about his games being over rated broken malware.
id be more concerned that a billion dollar studio is putting out posters that look like below amateur photoshop
i don t care if nebula becomes more butch or whatever  as long as they don t make the character  non-binary  or trans.
this cast is from an old ages  theyre mostly pretty.. theyd gladley replace them all with more suitable for modern time... this is kind of in that direction... at least they saved me the trouble of watching guardians vol 3 which i probably would have otherwise
first jumanji before they used the push up bras and other scenes  don t think she s pushing much more than a a cup in reality.  i just think people are making a big deal about the wrong girl. she s been an activist as well.i think everything else other than that area is top her looks her legs her curves are fine but that  region  has always been not so clear but i m not s big fan so i m sure other creepers know her dets much more than i do.
no one is addressing what a creep this director is and it s driving me crazy. people got so worried about cancel culture that they just gave him a pass on his extensive history of predatory comments. wake up to the truth about this hollywood machine.gunn should never have been rehired.
it requires talent to make karen gillian look unappealing
just so you know  femen  is very common in japanese media whether it s video games or anime
international women s day is coming up i could congratulate myself at this point
that is photoshop karen not a pose that gave you a man body. but i still like karen s sense of humor. i just hope the high-evolutionary doesn t attach her head on a dude s body!
i m confused. the articles seem to think that people are complaining because she looks like a woman with an imperfect body. that s...not the problem. it doesn t look like a woman that s just not super skinny  it looks like a guy....
wish alot of these actors were like her   but unfortunately there not
unpopular opinion  she s covering up for something in the movie s plot she s not allowed to give away. my money is on - nebula s body gets fucked up in act i  or off screen  and she has to use a male one. but instead of this being comedic and played for laughs  it s going to be used to push lgbt talking points.
i agree with you 100 . i hope they don t make her look like a guy in any way in the movie.
rise of the they thems  sound like a movie title. was that the alternate  title to this   p
can we trade jumanji karen gillan for nebula ken gillan
i ... was not expecting that picture on you.
nebula is now knobula its offical
she didnt even mention the body she just talked about elbow lul
they made her look like billy corgan
weird how when she did the pose in the tiktok video her breasts and hips didn t magically disappear into the ether again like they did in the poster.
mantis is sweet
what if that s chris pratt s body in blue
gunn was a one trick pony  gotg1 was good  2 not so much and 3 is just going to be a wreck. gunn s suicide squad movie was gorribad and sadly wb spent a lot of money on that instead of investing into the dceu. gunn is also backing liar ah and whackadoo ezra miller  so the change in nebula fits in with his agenda  not what the fans want.
disney got some  splaining to do!!!
ugh  why d they do my girl nebula like this...
while i do not like what this seemingly applies  i also get pissed off at people pushing republican talking points like melonie is here. although melonie seems to be mainly ignorant calling transgender  seemingly  a mental illness and something that s being  pushed  on the kids. certainly this approach that disney is seemingly taking helps nobody on either side so wtf are they doing
you get called biggut. like nebula s big gut  am i right  oh!
god help us all.
trans nebula  first intergalactic railroadthis poster also does a few more subtle things.star lord looks more like a marvel soyboy than a hero.drax is covered up and sitting back  because being muscular and showing it is the new notsee extremist position.mantis even kinda dressed like a biker for some reason. in fact  i dare say she looks like a semi-butch lesbian.
looks like they put nebula s head on yondu s body
i think we should just wait it out before accusing them of woke or transgenderism. let s not be leftist crazy. keep an open mind and enjoy the movie. personally  guardians is my favorite mcu.
we all know why they did this.
i actually kinda respect her more for ignoring the issue and making it comical.
mel made a good point though it s not then a good male body  it s an antifa generals body not a male soldiers body.can t argue that one.
the only reason i m watching this movie is because of dave bautista and his final marvel film.
when she posed  she didn t look anything like the picture. you didn t really pull it off either  sorry. but you still look amazing!
when disney bought marvel  it was believed that mickey mouse would be a main character.  what is mickey mouse  besides a macguffin for the disney theme that ties everything together   disney went woke  and their new-generation  wild artists don t know how to draw a woman  because they want the androgynous theme  karen gillan is famous as a curvy woman  and she is being forced to apologize for her man-look in guardians of the galaxy volume 3.  this is demonic  because it is about attacking the image of god  so that we cannot obey god  we are all made in god s image  and man and woman are the only choices of the human species  if i had a dollar for every gender  i would have two dollars.  the satanism demands that god be disobeyed  right into reality  it isn t a passive evil one  it is active in demanding the lie.  if disney wanted only a c3po robot in guardians of the galaxy  then they should have done that  instead of casting karen gillan as nebula.
melonie  it looks to me like she talked around it instead of about it.she s not well-endowed  but with a true artistic rendering  you should see some subtle lift under the right arm and a breast profile on the left.
you aren t bigoted  melonie...  uneducated in some areas  but not bigoted.  the absolute worst thing i can say is that you may be unintentionally ignorant. i say this because i am bipolar.  you seem of the opinion that people like myself can just get over it  be treated and it s over.  if that were the case  i d have had a happy life.  it doesn t work like that.let me give you a frame of reference.  you are a woman  and i assume you have had to deal with the menstrual cycle since you hit puberty.  the majority of women can suffer from emotional instability right before during right after.  even if you are one of the lucky few who has never experienced this  i sure you ve seen it in others.  now  imagine that instability happening every day  but worse.  that s a normal bipolar individual  this doesn t even cover when they actually have mood swing  where the biochemistry actually goes out of balance.while it s true that counseling and therapy can help a bipolar person possibly deal with their regular everyday instability  nothing short of medication can help with the biochemical storm that happens during an actual bipolar cycle.  this is why bipolar people get that chemical assistance during non-cycling times.  the closer a person can get to being  balanced  during normal days  the less they will be effected on the cycle days.  constant management is required.  you don t just  get better .now that you ve had a bit of education on wht being bipolar is like  i hope you learn from it  because if you do  you re not a bigot.i can t comment on the trans thing.  i still haven t learned enough.  every time i ask a  why  question  or any for that matter   i get called a bigoted transphobe and shut down.  ignorance for them is bliss  i guess.
this is what happens when you don t make the photo shoot and they put in the only place holder available a 5  9  slightly chubby delivery driver  - they photo shopped on the face but ran out of time trying to fix the body.
what a mess they made of another marvel team. i m sick of it.  i kind of feel sorry for her.  got a strong filling the actors are worried about not just contract but future job security.  and if they complain they get cancelled you know blacklisted.
it s not  dad bod   it s tranzbod...and we all know it.
i wonder what the excuse is going to be for chris pratt looking like he s lost about 40 pounds of muscle.
it would be funny if she got body swapped in the movie with a dude that looks like hank hill. so for the majority of the movie it s nebula s head on hank s body and she tries to sell people propane.
nebulas a troon nowat least they let us know now so we can skip the movie
they totally didn t photoshop my head on a guy s body! i made this pose! ugh i m such a silly! eyes on the screen drones.
why is karen even commenting on this if she has nothing to do with the poster
the accent takes her from a 10 to an 11
at this point i would rather see her in jumanji 3. disney is off the rails woke.
that s a photoshop and she knows this. the studio is gaslighting
still  there is no breast in the movie poster  and the gut is 30 percent bigger
we re gonna find out that she transitioned in the movie  just because.
basically we were all asking where are the curves  she talks about her pose regarding her elbow...
i wouldn t take her  opinion  serious at all. the doesn t want to bomb her own career so of course she will try to explain it away.maybe if she gets to a higher level of stardom where she will fill seats regardless of what she says she could speak out against it but she isn t there yet.
i was watching a jurassic world velociraptor video on the official yt channel..and in the comments one guy addressed the raptors with they them!
that s more than just the pose. just look up images of karen as nebula. that is not her body.
i think its her body. i have taken some really weird pics before and i m sure i m not alone saying that. weird enough for me to think this could just be the camera angle
did they photoshop her head on to a different person s body
she took the blame for the powers that be.
based on the poster alone  i probably won t go see this one
so she says basically says that this is her body  maybe she is paid not to talk about it
pining after you gets me nowhere.  just sitting  clawing at the screen to get at you.
melonie mac s toes match her fingers perfectly
she s makingba joke  i think it s pretty funny.
pants look like star lord  so probably a body flip with him.
lesson learned  disney. you too can be a convincing member of the opposite sex  but only if you have millions to spend on special effects.
i think they just photoshoped james gunns body and put nebulas head and arms on it  wouldnt surprise me at this point  jk
why is karen lying about it  though
the main villain does human animal hybrids why not do a man  woman hybrid story line  she s a femal and her true character is that she hate that she can t control her body cuz thanos now the writers wanna get in the action as well
i can t wait for the day when disney goes under..
come on chill marvel always edit some things to hide. if she looks like that in movie then we need to worry other wise i think they are just hideing something
they did her dirty that s it
they literally put her head on sean gunn s body. it s really obvious.
they put nebulas head  on chris pratts body from when he was in parks and rec.
disney just can t handle that we like something that isn t pushing their woke insanity.
gillan... oh... honey  its not the pose.
men with dad bods can finally feel represented on screen.  but at what cost
i m calling it now  nebula is gonna be  non-binary   in the movie
that may be her pose  but its not her torso
some guy put his own image in the poster either as a stunt  a  woke protest  or as a trial run to see the reaction and to draw attention to the fact disney is making another gotg movie. right now for disney any publicity is good publicity
thats one of  star lords sweatshirts shes using. thats a big story spoiler if you read the leaked movie script. it looks really bad in the poster anyway.
karen gillian has a great personality and very attractive making her one the hottest women on the planet. watch her vouge interview vid its hilarious.
i just remembered the original her is dead. she the one from the other timeline. i wonder why she hop bodies
that dam male gaze!!
i sense a disturbance  in the force about this film
why don t they want her to look feminine  bryce dallas howard even said they wanted to flatten her as well.
god bless you!
at this point it s just marketing bait. for example i m far enough removed from society that i only know of new movies through youtube videos like this or others that discussed her body shape
she probably is lying because she didn t adress the body only the arm
also chris prat looks skinny compared to how he was in recent stuff he did like terminal list
the rise of the they thems lmao
i guess they all get sex changes from the looks of all other characters.
we want to turn women into men and turn men into women.  -modern society
blue billy corgan
it s probably a thing to just get more promoting
most likely something to do with the story.
the horror  ..... the horror .....
dude
it looks more like billy corgan
did you notice she can t mach up that pose. yup that was not her in the poster.
that s billy corgan.
it s def a sucky cutout photoshop job - characters we re prob shot different times and places and perspective was wrong so they used other bodies  prob male  as comps. then whoever was working on it lost track of which body was comp and didn t care cuz it was smoke break o clock.
yep i completely agree  that is not karens body in that poster.  if you look at the picture side by side with her in jumanji she has a very pronounced hourglass figure  a thin mid waist and a noticeable bust.  the nebula body is wide  with no curves just straight from the waist to hip  and a completely flat chest.  that is unmistakably a dude.
it is ma am!
deflecting  that s fine i get it.
camera adds on a couple 50 pounds
amen.
she looks like billy corgan.
i think its just a joke  nothing else.  i hope
nebula is going to come out as a trans robot man
with this being a disney mcu movie  especially now  i know it will be trash and i am also probably never going to visit a movie theater again or pay anywhere near full price once they go to video.
t least she made a joke instead of taking offense like lost people nowdays do
dude who cares it s a poster
this will be some cheap laugh gag throughout the movie if they are body swapping her a bunch.
you know to slow motion red carpet camera lol
you have to understand the humor about the post.
nothing to do with the pose. is the post production of the poster is an issue.
probably a case of her having to self censor if she wants to be on another project. i m not a woman but i do know that women want to be seen as beautiful not whatever that is supposed to be on that poster
looks just like billy corgan to me...
that is not her body  she is too beautifully hour glasses to look like that.
they did the same cgi for she hulk they used a dude for they hulk out part
i know amy pond. and that is not amy pond s body.
her arm is at the wrong angle. it s obviously someone else s body.
isn t it funny how they didn t go with this look for nebula and star-lord from the get go  no  they wait until they have two successful movies to then pull this nonsense.
she s british
the head transplant could be it
the only thing that doesn t stop these actors from saying anything and going against this trash has to b the money they get paid.... a beautiful women like karen is getting casted for the most part is based off how great tv she looks  taking that away makes everyone on the same level...the millions and millions of dollars they r getting is to make them shut up  and take it.once again a movie i m not seeing
she absolutely does not explain it. more like she half-assed made fun of a pose she made. what happened to her curves  her lovely lady lumps  on top of that  she s not the one to take responsibility for the pose. what was the marketing team  especially the photographer thinking  photoshoots consist of several if not dozens of shots.yet  this is the one they chose. smh
i guess phase 6 will be marvels m they u
current mcu.
star-lord looks weird too. i thought he is more buff than that. karen s explanation seems like a company ploy.
will rocket get breast implants
commenting to feed the algorithm
she s lying!! she s doing damage control. taking one for team disney.
no pose can make a feminine body look like a beer gut dad bod  this was done to the photo itself and marvel has her apologizing for it  i also feel that if she was a woman of color she would be doing the norm and calling everyone racist.
the picture is photoshopped to take away her curves. pure and simple. if you watched jumanji  2017  you can tell this picture is not her body.
she is humorously taking the blame for something that is obviously photo shopped  they removed her chest and hips or stuck her head on a man s body. notice they removed all of star lord s muscles  he looks like a skinny stoner.
feminine curves   naked muscular chris hemsworth   the double standard is real
her name is karen  how much should i take her words seriously
the poster that lost guardians a billion dollars.guardians of the genderverse coming to a theater near you. don t rush out to get tickets. there will be many empty seats to choose from.
love karen gillan. despise disney  hey disney  represent this .
i m so tired of hollywood s heterophobia
she didnt exlpain shit  it was probably pr approved gaslighting. she weirdly goes on and on about  the pose . no one said anything about the pose  its the anatomy which is weird  and not a single word about that.
well  there s another movie added to the list ill never watch
not her body at all  and her explanation does not even address the elephant in the room. disney just cant stop failing.
has anyone told her that it has nothing to do with how she posed and everything to do with the fact that s a man s body with her face cgi on top...
didn t they have photo shoots  they choose the bad photo and dint bother photoshop it  i don t buy it!
well not gonna even watch the movie... not only because of this  but... everything guardians were after endgame
movie posters have just plain sucked for decades now
poor girl. she tries to apologize but never addresses the gender swap on her body. marvel did her wrong.
looks like they put her head on yondu s body. i don t think trans representation is what he had in mind when he said   i m mary poppins y all.
whatever the idea was behind the poster  putting her face on that body is just wrong.
if you don t like it  then don t watch  you racist!
but she is scottish
she s not that type of karen.
i wonder if disney made her make this statement. it has nothing to do with the pose. it has to do with it being a mans body.
who decides what is feminate enough  there was a time when a woman in pants was considered an outrage.
there s nothing to address in the current era.  a good joke that they like to do in marvel.
they did chris dirty too
i bet it has to do w the disney agenda
that is clearly a dudes body and they photoshopped it to make her look like alien joe dirt
her race when pregnant turns masculine
i d call it less of a  dad bod  and more like a  gay mafia bod .
4 52 ok if it s something that happens in the movie later in the movie don t put it on the poster like i don t understand the whole let s put easter eggs and everything. yeah let s make it to where we spoil what s going to happen that s so stupid.
this poster of the characters do not even resemble the guardians of the galaxy. had the difference not been pointed out   i would still think it was a  poorly made spin-off.
they better have not i swear
yeah her explanation has nothing to do with  posing ... im a photographer. ..i know a lot about posing...and you cant take her body and make it look like the poster..that is photoshop.
bodies are odd  huh
it s amazing or not  they believe wholeheartedly in the directions they ve chosen to take. yet when called on it  they hem and haw and make excuses  instead of standing up for their  beliefs . marketing ploys anyone
the movie might end up being decent but the marketing has done it no favors. horrible trailers and posters.
that is not even her. her shoulders aren t wide enough to even bend her elbow at that angle.the funny thing is  as an android  she is entirely binary... 101100101011101
i wonder if they are referencing to her feeling like a guy  instead of a women.
i call bs on that story.  androgynous pat
kinda sucks cause karen is an attractive woman
they are making nebula they
we all know why this happened. 100  intentional and we all know why...     btw  whoever did the movie poster  needs to go back and learn how to make proper movie posters where dog heads don t clip out of the color overlay  making it look like an amateur last minute edit.  the concept for this movie poster is so lackluster. nothing about it says  watch this movie!! .  more like  yeah.... its gonna suck.
she s a robot right
i really enjoyed guardians of the galaxy but i won t be watching the third one.
shoot.... so is there a pose that a man can do that turns them into a woman
sorry i m late. seems i m not getting notifications today.  and remember to drink water.
took her 2 minutes to say absolutely nothing.
it s not your elbow!
i think the term you mean to use is trendsgendered
to be fair  nothing on this poster is working. why is drax wearing a heavy coat  where is star lord s duster  why is rocket s disembodied head on the bottom next to ghamorra  the previous guardian s posters were vibrant and colorful like the characters  but this one is brown and grey. this entire poster is a mess  and there should be a public apology.
looks like gunns brothers body with her head
i think it s time for someone to break out the  delorean .. talk bout the amount of tickets u could sell.. taking the sane one s back to 1988.. to set this future  straight  again..
i wonder if it s either a very loose shirt or a very poor photo editor.
no..she got a call and they probably told her to find a way to cover up this crap of a pose and say she did it  i don t buy it one bit
how do you take one of the most beautiful women in the world and maker her look like something that lives in a trash dumpster     just add disney magic.
that s a man s face too. it s not karen s face.
i m blind!
it s all marketing. disney made this poster on purpose. look at everyone  they are all  odd . and guess what.... people are talking about disney and the movie. even bad press is good press.
it looks like a bad photoshop. they have taken her head and placed it on a mans body.
look like a ellen elliott thang going on
let s see that thang yea
the art department mutilated her in that poster. or it s a story element. her body gets swapped. transhumanism stuff.
it s not her the shoulders do not even match. the left shoulder is shorter than the right.
damn that poster is bad  like in general that is a boring ass poster. it s like they didn t even bother and thought  it s the guardians  these chumps are gonna see it anyway cause they eat up any old crap we put out .
usually with a pose like that  women would have the other hand placed on their hip. it s a way to look sexy. however  disney deliberately made her look male. this whole entire poster looks terrible. just the way star lord looks makes him seem emasculine. instead of everyone looking bad-ass they  re just all too relaxed.
invasion of the they thems!...from outer space!!
karen is beautiful  and that isn t her body at all. i m going to assume that it s a woke thing until proven otherwise.
nebula gets blown up and since she s machine they got her a new body which ends up being male just for the woke mob.
karen gillan is a beautiful woman. she probably can t discuss it because of non  disclosure agreement. disney wants androgynous characters. if you are a bigot   then i guess so am i. i m not okay with this frankenstein nebula. may i say you look beautiful. and i enjoy your videos. god bless
this is damage control
everyone in that poster looks weird - star lord also looks physically off and so do groot and drax.
marvel phase 4  women power. marvel phase 5  lgbt power.
karen gillan does not have to say sorry for anything bc it is not her fault and it is disney company fault to have her look like that in the movies. anyway she is a great actress in the movies but she looks like she had a man s body in the movies and she is sad bout how disney company had her dress in the movies to look more manly like then a lady in the movies and i just want to say that she does not have to apologize for it at all  ok melonie. anyway i just want to say something about the video for today  ok melonie. anyway i hope you had fun with playing hogwarts video game last night and i hope to join y all next time when i am free and when i don t have to be anywhere with my family this week  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a great blessed day and evening at home and have a good nite too melonie.
love you
i dont see mickey and minnie changing genders or sexuality
they are making nebula go trans for woke points. i bet ya!it will back fire  the movie won t do good  double down!
dont use photoshopping to make people look their best even when promoting a movie instead we ll use it now to add weight to female characters so  real  woman aren t insulted
nebulae them they marvel 2023
flat girls are best!
thank god for japan! they haven t done this type of crap there. at least not yet.
what do you mean that s not a womans body  i mean  it looks just as feminine as current day lara croft s body...
nebula new look be like  https   youtu.be wirhk6vbmug
pretty weak damage control.
yeah  that s not her.
they are getting their derri res handed to them over the woke agenda. this is an effort to play stupid before the film comes out. i bet that since she is a cyborg  they are going to change her to gender fluid or to a male in the middle of the film. the trailer shows star lord showing slight interest in her. so i bet she changes to a he after that scene.
i don t buy it. they heard the backlash and contacted karen gillan and told her to do damage control because they fkd up the poster
they made a pretty woman look like an androgynous boy.  and made pratt scrawny.  what an accomplishment!
i wish you would turn your volume up  i can barely here you and the videos you play.
the mcu will officially die once woke disney will ruin their last legacy characters in gog 3 and on the way take the time to ruin adam warlock.
its ben edited poster
i think you re trying to say that mental issues should not be reinforced. yeah
karens face on a dudes body sounds nice.just not like this.
she has a gut not gutz
until the film comes out i will just say they brought her out to try to hide away spoilers.
i m an ewok.
nail on the head. nebula will likely come close to death then get transplanted into drax. boom! transman disney! yay! not so much.
...guys. its not that deep.
boom boom babe is back
chris pratt s body also looks feminine. body switching has been done. it was only relatively funny the first time
comment number 112  where the players dwell
having a little electric tantrum.  virtually throwing everything around.
and im bjork
@silver  hello bjork o.o
i was back yesterday too  just took the weekend off
@melonie mac go boom  i saw that toocontroversial as usual
if you really listen though she s not talking about the shape of her body but rather talking about the pose. it seems like she has no problem looking like a dude....
i lost all interest in guardians 3 after this poster.
she s lying.  no pose that she does can make her look like that.  so....is she trying to cover up that she trabsed to a man or is she lying for the studio which in plot makes her gender change
that s terrible photoshoping
what happened to chris pratt in that pic. he looks vegan. muscle gone.
hey extra sauce
used to like her  but this just shows she ll do anything for money
they them   legion
you all are comparing what she looks liek when she doesn t eat anything to someone who is in her natural weight...just think what you re doing call her a dude when she s not doing anything wrong.  that is her body!  and look who s hosting this channel...lets come back when melonie is karen s age...all women widen when they re in their natural weight.  stop with the body shaming!
why do we care what a fictional characters body looks like  does it really matter
you re focused too much on nebula in this poster.  look at the rest  starlord looks skinny af.  like his arms look the same size as  new yondu   i forget the character s name .  drax looks frumpy.  etc. the whole thing is just....on-brand for disney..and by that i mean just lazy.
think rose namajunas
hahaha after years of not working out after the military  you re  fat skinny  commentary hit home... i m not proud of this  but shame can be a motivator too
she s trolling. yall sad for caring so much over a movie poster.
karen is apologizing for the sjw lunatics at disney...
anyone else annoyed by young groot yet
everyone knows  woman   feminism   man  lol
slow news day grifting sometimes it gets difficult for you huh  whatever gets those clicks.
shut down disney
why would they make a woman look like a man  when they could recast the character with a man  who already looks like a man
she was paid to say this. there is no way that is her body. they took her face and put it on a man. i love karen gillan. been following her since doctor who. but this    please don t insult your audience. this is clearly a man s body with her face on it.
this why i ve stopped watching anything new.
nebula is trans now.
that is 100  not her body. that s a man s body.
so  did they misgender her  or did she steal a role from a trans person
i guess this is the movie with mongoloid looking adam warlock if gamora is alive again.
they have ruined her character.
absolutely nothing to do with ger pose  everything to do with left wing art department airbrushing her into a males shape.
karen gillan is one of the most classically beautiful women in cinema today. she s beautiful  charming and funny  but she s made to look like a west virginian meth dealer  on her movie poster no less  why i m a gen xer who grew up with the 80s androgyny in film and music  i have no issue with it. what i can t understand is marvel s continuing desire make beautiful people appear flatly unattractive  we go to movies for the escape. i can see dumb  unattractive people all day at walmart  why would i pay to see the same thing at the theater  i don t want to sound like a broken record  but who are they making these films for  i only ask as the last several marvel films have flopped insanely hard. perhaps marvel are asking the same damn question  sorry disney  but this isn t working out at all.
this needs to cost them. guardian s was the one movie that was a little more resistant to woke  but because of this crap it needs to be boycotted. i won t be seeing this s-show. the holiday special was the end of the series for me i guess.
i don t know the chatacters  so i thought that was a dude.
she s a robot and you care about her clothing  damn y all are bored asf
it makes no sense a female or woman s body would look like that without outside alteration!! to alter a female   woman s body like that to make her look like a man s body is utterly disgusting hey!! like what is the objective and who is being served in this   i don t know who made this image but it is clear it is a crop and paste into the background and if they used a cheap ai to do it then it starts to make a lot of sense!! either way.. this is inexcusable!! sadly  the fans are use to this rubbish from disney these days!! here is the thing.. if we don t watch it.. any  validation  does not matter and i am not going to watch and waste my time on this hey!!
the character was given a huge down grade. it s too bad.
lol so let me get this straight  an other beautiful redhead that was woke-washed in a movie for  inclusivity .
can t hate on gillian too much for lack of explanation. it s not her responsibility to explain  and she jeopardizing her career if she does try to explain it. she was smart of just joking around about it. could be worse  she could be a ugly cgi mermaid  calling everyone racist. unless it was her idea and she told to james gunn to make neb trans  she s got nothing to do with it  and probably has no idea it was done to begin with. that is not her body  it is a bad photo-shop. not simping for a multimillionaire who doesn t know i exist  but that is the side of the boat i m on until she is proven guilty of anything. all eyes should be on gunn. but she is also prob not talking  because of her design being spoiler relating.  spoiler nebula is a transformer  but hey  i m not woke  what do i know.
james gunn creepy guy
wouldn t be surprised  if they came out with some bullshit excuse saying she s meant to reposent the trans people in the mc.
so  all women have to look traditionally feminine at all times and if they don t  that s deeply offensive
we all know whats goin on..........disney and their androgenous tg crap
she is lying
being pretty is bodyshaming fat purple haired whales and that is not very woke. so disney photoshopped hardcore level.
the pose is not the issue here  photoshoping a womens body to look like a dude is though.
could easily be story related.
i really grew out of marvel movies these last years to the point i almost hate them. bad cgi  stupid bad jokes  woke agenda  action scenes are laughable  plot holes  superpowers are not consistent  cringe sad scenes where you are supposed to cry but just cringe and i could go on and on and on... i got rid of marvel and netflix and i must say i do not miss those at all.
the intention is to make her look like a dude.  why
average inverness resident.
i felt it was leaning into the  awkwardness  of her character. like she wasn t trying to be a person or sexy in the other films. this is the first film we get to see her free of thanos. you re viewing the character outside of context. she s supposed to seem like she doesn t know what she s doing  especially since the marketing is leaning towards  we are posing for photos  she doesn t look like she knows what she s doing. like you don t understand art gurl.
i stopped watching a while ago. marvel and disney are dead and they did it too themselves. no more masculine heroes. when monsters roam the streets remember who killed the heroes.
she looks like a dude in the trailer too  it s not just the poster. she s basically only shown in really baggy  unflattering costumes.
i just don t get it
its to appeal to disney s trans community.
i love karen gillan but wont be supporting this movie.
hope it bombs worse than ant man
nobody simps for the mcu...not even possible anymore because no one is so lame to find the mcu interesting at all anymore.
i think i know the twist. they are going to have the high evolutionary change her to a man. i bet with all the dumb marvel disney humor it will be played for laughs or as stunning and brave.
why are you wearing adidas gear  they are an openly woke company that worries more about esg points than making good gear.
they could have at least went with a muscular dude body. this doesn t make  transition  look nice.and obviously dads with dad-bods will be offended.
abbvie pharmaceuticals.
why do you keep appearing on my feed
the tran stuff is in everything now. so sad
hi there
pls stop using pronouns  and take insults like biggot as a badge of honour   please treat people with respect and care  specially those with mental issues  like depression  eating disorders  gender dysphoria   bipolar disorder  etc  etc. but please don t comply their delusion. it s important that as society we address a problem we have   having so much ppl with gender dysphoria in so few space of time is not normal and that should be the news  not all the bs trying to normalize a mental disorder epidemic. i m sick of this.
why my comment was removed  i didn t say anything mean to anyone or sexist
she had a man s body in the trailer i saw today.
i stopped watching anything disney   marvel after endgame its all just predictable woke trash now
nope. not buying it. be honest young lady  tell the truth.
agreed we should love them  but don t encourage or support their problems actions.have you seen jesus revolution yet
sooooo when the movie comes out and karen looks like this flat chested  dad bod... thing in every scene... is she gonna blame the pose or admit they made her trans to push.... the message!!
the metrosexual writing room strikes again.
pyt
hollywokie  is now pure  .  at least the first 2 guardians of the galaxy movies were good.
fake hollywood.
let s face it. mcu died after the 1st end game movie. because the 2nd part of end game and everything after has been complete trash. i walked away after the 2nd end game movie. disney is garbage and by extension so is the mcu   star wars.
evryone on that poster looks a little goofy i think who ever photo shoped it need to work on thier skills a bit more.... probs a diversity hire...
first
the movie is going to be mediocre at best.. mark my words. the amount of woke garbage they are going to throw at you is going to be horrid.
you are reading way too into this. it is a bad pose and baggy clothing
nothing wrong being trans
why does a poster trigger so many people first off karen don t have big curves never was said she had a dad bod or man bod.
i didn t remove anything  likely was youtube filtering comments even though i have it checked not to. they still remove stuff for some reason
@melonie mac go boom  i didn t go against the  guidelines   i reminded the rules from the morale higher-ups
@jeremy john hall  yeah youtube is dumb  sorry that happened
@melonie mac go boom  no problem  that s just how stuff is nowadays. i guess i said something wrong. or my tone wasn t how they would have like it.
transitioning of the galaxy  honestly who still watches disney trash
that image reeks of pandering to the transgenders.she was far better in doctor who. not sorry but the  robotic breathy voice  can only carry a character so far and it isn t much.using the  multiverse  is an excuse to replace established characters with woke alphabet versions that none were ever popular in comics.
marvel is dead.
...horrible...
after gunns agenda for the new dc slate  and the way of sh-marvel. i have no care for to pay for any of it. won t see a nickel from me   unless multiple credible sources say otherwise.
this movie is going to fail
nebula is a trans. this will kill the movie lol
